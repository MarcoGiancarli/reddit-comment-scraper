Switzerland,3e5ljn,canteloupy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:52:37 2015 UTC,"Is your point that the double taxation thing is overblown, since she would get a credit off of her US tax bill for the taxes she paid in Switzerland?   That's true. But it's still not a fair system. For one thing, the way the credit system works is that you start by figuring what the US tax bill would have been if it all had been earned in the US. If your US taxes would have been higher, you still have to pay the extra to the US (and if your US tax bill would have been lower, tough luck). Second, the US and Swiss systems don't line up in terms of investment income: 1) Switzerland does not tax capital gains, while the US does, so you have to pay US capital gains taxes in any case; 2) as she mentions, Switzerland taxes wealth, while the US doesn't, so if she paid Swiss wealth tax (which admittedly only kicks in at a fairly high level of wealth) she would not get a credit from the US for it. 3) the US has these bizarre rules about ""Passive Foreign Investment Corporations (PFICs)"" which basically screw you over in a variety of ways if you invest in a non-US-based investment fund. I learned this after ten years or so of living in Switzerland and blithely putting a lot of money into Swiss (or Luxembourg)-based funds, then learning about the PFIC rules from my tax adviser. It's entirely a protectionist measure on behalf of the US mutual fund industry, but it's the kind of thing where the only people affected have zero visibility and zero political clout so Congress doesn't give a damn. Rant over."
Switzerland,3e5ljn,basiliscpunga,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:10:41 2015 UTC,"No, but she minimizes the amount of taxes one pays on their salary in Switzerland. As a member of the upper middle class, that 5% figure is misleading for several reasons. The tax burden does fall heavily on salaries as well. Especially for double income couples or people with side businesses. Not to mention that once you have kids your daycare expenditures are also based on your income.  All her points are still very valid, though. I also think in the US between the need to set money aside for college, paying private daycare through the nose because no subsidies exist, the lack of child allocations for everyone, etc, families probably still end up paying more than here."

So just take the cable car to Schilthorn. And when you get down, walk from Mürren to Lauterbrunnen. Or even better: to Grütschalp where you can take the cable car down to Lauterbrunnen. This hike is a bit shorter and not so steep and ideal for new hikers.  Alternatively check out a hike from Lauterbrunnen/Wengen to Grindelwald. It is a somewhat demanding walk but the paths are in a very good condition and ideal for new hikers. This walk follows the train tracks to and from Kleine Scheidegg, so if you get tired you just walk to the next station and take the train.

Every family member is insured individually, regardless of age. Anyone arriving in Switzerland with the intention of staying must take out such insurance within three months. Parents are allowed the same period in which to insure their newborn children.The basic health insurance reimburses retroactively for any health-related expenses incurred up to the time the insurance coverage began. Since expenses are reimbursed retroactively, consequently it is mandatory to pay the premiums retroactively from the beginning of coverage on.  The insured may choose any health insurer he wants, and the insurer must accept him irrespective of his age and state of health, and without any reservations or qualifying period.   Makes sense. Health insurance is mandatory, therefore you were insured even without insurance. I guess it's a bad surprise for you now, but you would have been happy to be able to rely on it in case of an illness/injury in the last 6 months."

I am sure they have annoyed people in the past, but on the other hand they are kids. They should be able to have fun. They are sometimes loud and believe me they annoy me too, but on the other hand I do not want my little kids to behave like perfect little grownups. Occasionally I might not even notice, as I have gotten used to their energy, etc. For example, during a flight, I might let them walk up and down the aisle for like 5-10 minutes. I watch them while they are doing it. I make sure they don't bother or touch anybody or get in peoples way.  It breaks up the monotony for them for a bit and means they will be quiet for a bit after. I think that is ok, but some people might find this annoying. Not sure. Nobody has ever said anything. I will also let them chat to passengers around us, if that person seems receptive and I always tell them they can tell me if it bothers them and tell my kids to stop if the other person starts reading, etc. Anything to keep them calm and entertained.   Of course if they scream I tell them to stop. I would not let them touch clothes in a shop with dirty hands. I would not let the knowingly annoy other people. Climbing up the handrails in the subway? Only use the subway like once or twice a year, but I can imagine letting them do it, IF it's not busy and making sure nobody is actually using it."

That is one of the things that I personally hate the most, hardly anybody adresses a problem directly and with reason but tries to give some edgy comment about the issue and hopes that the problem-maker picks up on it. Just fucking tell someone that you were first in line and they cut in front of you, instead of telling everybody else how they got raised wrong by their parents ffs.  /rant"
Switzerland,3dxmb5,cynicbla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:12:44 2015 UTC,"lol, unfortunately have to agree. Story time. My parents built a house years ago on a plot of land that was surrounded by other houses. Some people did not like that, having been used to this plot being empty and complained about everything. Anyway, we still remained polite with everybody, hoping and mostly succeeding, that the community would accept us after some time (we only moved from the next village). The biggest problem was the neighbor who was next to our garden, but we remained polite. One day my mum was in garden working and the neighbor was doing the same in hers. Of course my mum said hello and started some small talk. The neighbor mentioned how she was happy that it started raining the evening before. My replied that yes the plants in the garden needed it. To which the neighbor replied ""No, it meant you finally stopped sitting outside with your friends and went inside."". I am sure this is the same person who once called the police when I had a BBQ with about 10 friends in the garden. We were young, but not especially loud (talking, laughing, not screaming). It was a Saturday. The police arrived at 9.45pm. They realised there wasn't really any noise (all but three of us had gone into the house by this point) and left after asking me to just make sure we did not get noisy."
Switzerland,3dxmb5,P1r4nha,6,Tue Jul 21 08:35:46 2015 UTC,"The Swiss population is old, there's LOTS of elderly people (more than young ones), who abhor noise and agitation of any kind. When I lived in Geneva, it was impossible to organise any kind of event in some parts of town because the (elderly) population would be up in arms at the slightest noise. Blame a not-so-smart fiscal policy that doesn't encourage having children and overly restrictive immigration (big provider of youths).  Likewise, in buildings, senior citizens tend to impose their will upon young families, which makes for a kids-unfriendly environment in many places. Where I lived, there was a big grassy interior courtyard and the few elderly people living there managed to impose a ban on children there! They also petitioned to shut down a nearby daycare because kids were too noisy during the day. Also, we were theoretically not allowed to use bathrooms or watch TV after 10pm, which was ridiculous.  Here's the 2014 population pyramid for Switzerland: Age structure: 0-14 years: 15.1% (male 627,952/female 591,528)  15-24 years: 11.4% (male 469,536/female 451,547)  25-54 years: 43.9% (male 1,775,571/female 1,760,456)  55-64 years: 12% (male 484,278/female 486,220)  65 years and over: 17.5% (male 616,009/female 798,419) (2014 est.)"

Guess fucking what we're omnivores and apex-predators, yes we kill stuff to eat it, so does every other predator, okay, that list is too big, let's cut it down to other apex predators like us, ok? Can we make the animals listed there also stop killing other animals?

Depending on where in Geneva you are, let's say Airport, it's about 15min drive to Nyon, and then 15min drive up to the Jura. Up there you can walk around, have some food (go to Rando Burger for literally the best burgers in Switzerland-it's a Swiss-American family). That or La Dole. If you live here you might know what I'm talking about, but if you don't, basically it's that big white ball on the Jura. You can drive up there, all the way up to a really nice Chalet D'alpage where you can eat and drink in peace. And then you can hike up to the ball from either sides (left or right), which only takes maximum 30 minutes each way.   When I'm in a bad mood or need to get away, (I live between Nyon and the Jura mountains) I just go up there and walk in perfect beauty and quite through the pastures and forests, and have a coffee or something."

If you're looking for a good hike, I'd recommend you go to the Fruitières de Nyon - it's a ~1h30 hike from St-cergue through authentic mountain roads, and at the end you're rewarded with an absolutely fabulous view and local cheese. If you're more adventurous the walk up to the Barilette could be cool too, however that's a bit more physical. For a short walk I could recommend the Ballade de Beatrix, which is a short walk away from St-cergue - maybe 15 minutes away, and you get a really nice view."

Maybe you and I just have a different impression of what smiling stands for/attempts to express?

Switzerland,3dl1ss,stagshore,7,Fri Jul 17 03:21:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe Engelberg would be a Place to stay. Lots of hiking opportunities there. Its quite touristy though. But halfway to Zürich from Geneva and reachable by train. But you can get from every town to every other town in switzerland by train and bus in max. 4 hours or so :-)   A hike to the glacier of mount titlis would be possible.  You might want to check out this website with all the official hiking trails  Regarding camping, there is no general camping ban except in National Parks. You can camp anywhere because of the ""Jedermannsrecht"". If there is no "" Camping prohibited""sign. Be sure to ask before camping on private property.  Gluten free food is available look for ""free from"" label in coop stores like this"
Switzerland,3dl1ss,n3utr1no,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:49:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I've been looking at that map already, but wasn't sure how accurate it was. Good to know it seems to get used.  I'll have to check out Engelberg haven't seen that one yet. Though I'm attempting to stay out of touristy zones, and that's even more possible knowing train times are pretty minimal!  Thanks for the info on camping and GF!"
Switzerland,3dl1ss,stabmeinthehat,3,Fri Jul 17 06:31:23 2015 UTC,"The first place that comes to mind is Lauterbrunnen. That whole area around Interlaken is beautiful but I find Lauterbrunnen particularly stunning.  The Tour du Dents du Midi would also be a beautiful hike. You couldnt do it with camping gear but you can stay in mountain huts quite cheaply (much less than Airbnb). End of October is the absolute latest as its high (above 2,000 metres).  For camping I would recommend Lac De Taney and some hiking from there up to Le Grammont or Cornettes de Bise for stunning views over Lake Geneva. Lac de Taney is a lord of the rings type place, absolutely stunning and surrounded by mountains on all sides - but it starts to get cool in fall when the sun is lower in the sky, I wouldn't recommend it after September.  Gluten free is not really a thing in Switzerland, especially once you get out of the cities. You could avoid gluten but you will not often find the gluten free bread, pasta, etc. in restaurants. Supermarkets stock them."
Switzerland,3dl1ss,stabmeinthehat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:50:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response! I keep hearing about Interlaken and Lauterbrunnen so that may definitely be an option.   Tour du Dents du Midi looks really nice just from a quick overview of it. I saw a few of those huts included breakfast - do they also have a small market/restaurants of some sort as well for dinner/lunch? Or is it more like bring most of my own food for the huts as well? Obviously the trail portion I would make sure to have my own food.  I'll have to check out Lac De Taney tomorrow!  Cheers for GF info!
Switzerland,3dl1ss,silirius,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:28:34 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, the huts serve breakfast and simple evening meals. You can usually find mountain restaurants that serve lunch as well but I am not sure specifically about Dents du Midi - as it is higher and has no ski resorts I would not expect many restaurants. A breakfast at the hut, packed lunch on the trail and then a meal in the next hut at night is more likely.  These mountain huts for hikers are all over Switzerland, the Dents du Midi just happens to be close to where I live in the Lake Geneva region so I've heard a bit more about it."
Switzerland,3dl1ss,n3utr1no,2,Fri Jul 17 06:35:12 2015 UTC,"If you want to stay inbetween zurich and geneva I would recommend the bernese oberland. Lauterbrunnen as mentioned is nice, you might want to consider Thun or similar für airbnb and or cheaper places to stay. You can start a whole lot of trips from Thun, it's the gate to the oberland with fantastic view of the bernese alps.   About camping, the also mentioned ""Jedermannsrecht"" does not apply in switzerland (sadly) as it does in sweden for example. So in general you are not allowed to camp anywhere you like. If you ask the owner of privat ground they most likely will let you camp though. If you are high up in the mountains a bivouak would be legal, although I guess you plan to take more than just a bivi sack. Lot of SAC (swiss alpine club) huts will let you camp outside for a little fee to use their toilet so you might consider this as well.   Concerning gluten-free: Most supermarkets have gluten-free products. It'll be marked as something like ""gluten-frei"". Restaurants often do not specifically have something mentioned on the menu but if you ask the personell they will most likely say it's no problem. Just let them know!  Hope you will have a great trip in this beautiful area. If you're interested for a nice hike or so, let me know. I'm around ;)  silirius"
Switzerland,3dl1ss,silirius,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:20:23 2015 UTC,Well jedermannsrecht does not apply to private ground. But this post with ZGB article reference. Got me convinced it applies to communal ground.

Switzerland,3dicgk,redditttuser,14,Thu Jul 16 14:42:05 2015 UTC,"Hello foreigner  are you traveling to Switzerland? It seems like parts of your post have gone missing.  It's not really a problem to have 4 languages, one is barely spoken and they're regional. That means when I go out of the house and wander around in my city I don't have to be able to speak several languages to get around.  People that live close to the language borders are usually bilingual.  We have several TV and radio stations for each of the languages. That might be a bit complicated. Products are usually labeled in two or three languages, websites are translated in three or four languages (English).  In general there is a relatively high tolerance of each other's languages. National politicians speak several languages and press conferences are sometimes interesting because the reporters can ask questions in any language and the politicians might respond in another language, but usually we try to adapt to each other.  Would it be easier to have just one language? Of course it would be, but we would lose some of our identity and who wants that? We're fine with the situation like it is now. It's possible that with more and more young people being able to speak English the language barrier will be bridged with English instead of adapting to the other language. This can be both a loss and a win. The future will tell."
Switzerland,3dicgk,P1r4nha,4,Thu Jul 16 15:05:19 2015 UTC,"Very well written out answer!

I guess that advice gonna come in handy. Anyway, thanks a lot :)"
Switzerland,3dicgk,jacquesrk,6,Fri Jul 17 03:14:36 2015 UTC,"If you speak English, then you won't have much of a problem. If you go out in small villages, people won't speak English, but in tourist areas you can always find someone that will.  My experience of crossing the language barrier in Switzerland is:  Most Swiss Germans will know enough French to get by.  Most Swiss French (I am one of them) will know a little bit of German, but since the Swiss Germans speak French, we don't have to make as much of an effort. :) It doesn't help that the German we learn in school has a different pronunciation than the German that's spoken in Switzerland, so it's easier for a Swiss German to use his high school French with a French-speaking Swiss, than for a French-speaking Swiss to use his high school German with a Swiss German.  Italian-speaking Swiss usually know enough French AND German to be able to communicate.  The fourth language, Romansh, is isolated. Those people can be grouped together with the Swiss Germans as far as functional language knowledge is concerned.  There are cases when different languages can be confusing. Example:  I am taking a train from Lausanne to Geneva. In the train station, I look for signs that say ""Genève"", which is Geneva in French. The signs in the train station in Lausanne will be in French.  Then, a few days later, I am taking a train from Zürich to Geneva. This time, I have to look for signs that say ""Genf"", which is Geneva in German. The signs in the train station in Zürich will be in German.  One day, I take a trip to beautiful Bellinzona. I decide to take the train back to Geneva. This time, I have to look for signs that say ""Ginevra"", which is Geneva in Italian. The signs in the train station in Bellinzona will be in Italian.  But if you're driving, all road signs are pictures, not words like in the USA, so you don't have to worry about reading road signs.  Here are what the road signs look like. Don't worry, you're not supposed to know every single one of them!  http://www.astra.admin.ch/dienstleistungen/00127/00634/index.html?lang=fr"

Switzerland,3dicgk,Elmarco84,3,Fri Jul 17 03:44:24 2015 UTC,"If you stay in cities, or in touristic region you will be fine with english. Switzerland has officially 4 languages, but Romansh language is only spoken by very few people.  at school we learn one of the other national language, which helps to improve communication."
Switzerland,3dicgk,LJass,2,Thu Jul 16 14:54:28 2015 UTC,"Almost everyone speaks English, especially younger people in cities, so don't worry about the language.   Every region has its dialect/accent. To me, it's part of the beauty of ""feeling home"", I wouldn't want some ""unified national language"" even if it was my own mother-tongue. In practice, everyone can speak 1 or 2 or more other languages (even though some aren't very good with other national languages--looking at you, Suisse Romande lol).   In my family, we speak at least two languages in daily conversations, and sometimes up to 4 (although not perfectly, as you can imagine, but enough for what we need).   People are very attached to their regional dialects, so having 1 official national language wouldn't make people happy, plus it would pretty useless since multilingualism is a big thing here."
Switzerland,3dicgk,CaptIncorrect,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:17:39 2015 UTC,"That's relief.  And yeah, having more languages is really fun. I love that, too. What I mean having national language is.. Just selecting one language to whole country so that other part of the country can also feel comfortable having conversations. But the regional languages be same as they are now. IMO, it helps even foreigners like me. If I know that one language, I can go visit any part of the country. If somebody is going to stay in some part of the country then they have to learn regional language. That's acceptable! But just to visit, 4 languages, I was scared :p.  Anyway, I would like to know which is popular language among four, so that I can manage anywhere(almost) in the country.   And also, thank you so much for your response :)"

But it is not only about KESB - it is about gender questions in DE, CH and AT. If you follow the sick shit going on in that area it is more than necessary. Just the fact that there is one murderer case every month only in Switzerland makes it necessary"
Switzerland,3dg70c,DeepBlueNemesis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:05:54 2015 UTC,"Your ""statistic"" is both heuristic and biased. The Blick-article you posted is from September 2005 and even includes cases where the deed was done by females or it wasn't clear what happened. You kindly excluded all those in your post, just so you could make claims such as ""Dabei ist auffällig, dass in der Schweiz immer der Mann die Frau angreift oder mordet."" Not to mention that there is a marginal difference between ""attacking"" and ""killing"", and the article only covers the latter. You may want to check the statistics and official estimates on domestic violence ( ""Häusliche Gewalt"" ) by the government, cantons and independent aid orgainisations - or not, because they'd disagree with you and your selection bias.   If you truly ""followed the sick shit going on in that area"" you'd realize that the state and its organisations (Police, KESB, asylums, OHG etc) are mostly there as a cleanup crew when people are incapable of not hurting one another (both physical and psychological). In a second step they are left with the thankless task of figuring out the answer to ""How can we prevent the shit from hitting the fan without fucking up the child?"".   In Switzerland, the default decision for child custody is that it is split between both parents. If for some reason only one parent has custody, the other one fucked up severely. ""He/She set me up!"" is the default bullshit excuse of everyone who lost ever, most of the time what they mean is ""I don't believe the court has the authority to label my terrible life decisions as such and thus declare me an unfit parent!"". Courts need evidence, if it's word against word it will default to the shared custody and it will be closely monitored in case one parent truly is as shit as the other claims. That's usually not the case and everyone wasted their time because people are assholes.   Child support is a difficult terrain to navigate (and parliament is currently discussing some major changes) but people have to remember that having a kid is a financial commitment for ~20 years, and an emotional commitment for a lifetime.  Currently it works like this: the paying parent is guaranteed a minimal living standard while the recieving parent is not - they are the one that usually have to go for social help. Social help has to be paid back in full once the (former) reciever has started earing some more money, so it's a loan from the state and not ""yay free money from the taxpayer"", which is very wearing on everyone involved.   tl;dr many people don't know the hows and whys of the system, yet they point at random events and proclaim its utter and complete failure. While it's far from perfect, those people have yet to agree on something that would work better just in theory, let alone withstand the test of the real world."
Switzerland,3dg70c,unicornsworshipme,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:22:47 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that there is a marginal difference between ""attacking"" and ""killing""   sure this is a difference in the result. But the motive is generally the same. Things just going worse if the attack results in murderer.   ""in der Schweiz immer der Mann die Frau angreift oder mordet""   ok - far fetched. But it was in reference to the list of the post   ... (Police, KESB, asylums, OHG etc) are mostly there as a cleanup crew ...   maybe you are not very aware of the very unprofessional procedures of the KESB (and police and all other very bad authorities making money with family problems). Check out this case: http://redd.it/3ccltk - it is very common for the KESB to exploit any incoming case with bad financial interest and caring a shit for the welfare of children. Countless children have been trapped into custody against laws, against their will and without caring for their future at all. Take also a look into this cases: ""Auf der Flucht"" vor der KESB / Schweiz - wenn staatliche Behörden zur Mafia werden - obviously criminal action against a mother (in this case) and only the intervention of SVP-Nationalrat Pirmin Schwander and direct threat with criminal investigation against the KESB stopped them.   Your term 'cleanup crew' is a good description to them being near to terror squads destroying families with children. There are many who recogniced what is goin on: Julia Onken - Medienkonferenz: ""Was da passiert ist einer Demokratie nicht würdig .. das ist eine Schande für die Schweiz"""

If the kids are in high school or above, then they may not return home over lunch anyways.  Depending on how young the youngest kids are you may have to find daycare for them somewhere, but if you have an employer who has given you visas, I don't think you have to worry money wise when it comes to daycare anyways."

Switzerland,3d9vxj,Chrisixx,5,Tue Jul 14 17:35:05 2015 UTC,Many primary students (1st -5/6th grade) are sent home for lunch. But there are quite a few offerings for lunch clubs where you can send your kid (costs like 10CHF a meal). There they are supervised and get a good warm meal. Other option would be to ask the parents of the other children in the class of your kids if they could eat at their place.   Of course if you send your kids to a private school (like an international school) they will most likely offer a lunch service anyway and some even offer supervision after school till 6pm if needed.
Switzerland,3d9vxj,P1r4nha,3,Tue Jul 14 19:03:41 2015 UTC,"It's really interesting that there is no good solution for that. Dual-Earner housholds aren't a rarity anymore, but there is no official solution for parents that cannot come home over the lunch break. Sure, there are lunch clubs (I went to one myself) and sure they can just buy something or you could organize something with parents (people that you don't really know??), but it still surprises me that this is not a bigger issue."

While it isn't the sort of robotics that you see in the films, it's the sort that pays the bills. Get excited about CNC milling and microjet ablation and stuff if you want to have a successful career in robotics in Switzerland. If your goal is Geneva, then try and make plans for EPFL. You'll need a lot of money to pull that off as well as fluent French skills. If that is not realistic, then you need a Mechanical Engineering Bachelor's in the USA or wherever you live and maybe like $20k saved up for the master's. Then you can do the MS in Switzerland. That'll help you get your foot in the door visa-wise and help you establish a professional network. You could also approach the field of robotics from the computer science perspective. This will limit you in some ways to academic work, but it might be more interesting for someone who likes robots more than manufacturing.

The thing educated adults do in this case, however, is to acknowledge its unappealing nature and then move on. In no way should the aesthetics of sexual acts ever influence our moral judgment or making of laws in regard thereof.  I also agree with adoptions by non-heterosexuals, but I think it's wrong for people who naturally cannot have children to ""order"" a child by way of surrogate mothers and/or third party sperm. While I think having caring adults is in most cases psychologically better for children than having none, I cannot condone taking away a normal parental situation from a child just because two people see themselves equal to heterosexual couples. It's easy to imagine people wanting to be a parent and losing out on that aspect of life, but the well-being of the potential child is more important than equalizing-out any legal imbalance and more important than the non-heterosexual's feelings of missing out. Note that I also don't approve of bringing in a third party with heterosexual couples. The biological sense of identity of the child must outweigh the will of adults."

Switzerland,3cynx3,Canlox,10,Sat Jul 11 23:46:56 2015 UTC,"In order of importance at the lower chamber of the Parliament:   SVP: Used to be for farmers, not so extreme, but Blocher took control of it: now it uses populist conservative rhetoric (mostly anti-foreigners, particularly anti-Islam) to get elected, and mostly supports economic liberalism. Either you love them or you hate them, few people have mixed feelings. SP: Socialist Party. Similar to most socialist parties in Europe, i.e. social-democracy (unlike the American definition of socialism, which is a stepping stone to communism): progressive on social issues, wants an expanded government to fund more services. Clearly left-wing, unlike e.g. Germany's SPD or Britain's New Labour. FDP: Liberal party. Unlike the commonly used definition of ""liberal"" on reddit (which describes left-wing parties), in this case it's economic liberalism: small government, low taxes. Mostly socially conservative at the moment, though that might change. CVP: ... it's hard to say what they are now. They used to be powerful, and still are in a couple of cantons (mostly Valais/Wallis), but they've been on a downward slope for a while, so they try to re-invent themselves every so often. Right now they're mostly about ""the family"", or at least their definition of it (help married couples). While they love to talk about being in the center, they mostly end up with the FDP on economic issues. Greens: Watermelons: green on the outside, red on the inside. Their economic position are about the same as the SP, and they add ""environmental"" issues to the mix. Unfortunately, like most green parties, they don't have any idea of what they're talking about, so they're mostly promoting pseudoscience (organic farming, alternative medicine, anti-nuclear, anti-GMO, ...). Green Liberals: They have very few public positions, which is somewhat odd. They agree with the Greens on energy issues, and... that's about it. Maybe somebody involved with the party could tell us more? Recently got humiliated by the second-highest ""No"" vote on an initiative. BDP: Split from the SVP, originally created because two sitting SVP Federal Councilors got into too much conflict with the rest of the party (one of them was elected to replace Blocher, even though she wasn't running). ""Mild"" conservatism, somewhere between the CVP and the FDP."
Switzerland,3cynx3,Aethec,4,Sun Jul 12 09:41:44 2015 UTC,"The Green liberals are like the Greens, except they're blue instead of red on the inside. They like to think of themselves as striking the perfect balance between economy and ecology, but they obviously don't have much experience in dealing with the former.

Et aussi pourquoi la présidente c'est un socialiste alors que l'UDC à gagner l'élection?Est-il vrai que président est titre honorifique?"
Switzerland,3cynx3,Lejeune_Dirichelet,2,Sun Jul 12 04:40:19 2015 UTC,"Est-il vrai que président est titre honorifique?   Exactement. Le Conseil Fédéral est un collège, c'est à dire que ses 7 membres doivent prendre toutes les décisions en commun, et ensuite les défendre publiquement même si tout le monde sait qu'un Conseiller Fédéral en particulier n'est personnellement pas d'accord.   La fonction de président (et celle de vice-président, annexe) est descernée par l'Assemblée Fédérale tout les ans à un Conseiller Fédéral différent en fonction de son experience politique. La charge (souvent décrite comme primus inter pares, premier parmis des égaux)  est en effet surtout protocollaire; les seuls ""vrais"" pouvoir qui lui sont attribuée sont de pouvoir trancher si un vote du Conseil fédéral se termine en impasse, et d'avoir le droit d'agir au nom du Conseil Fédéral complet en situation d'urgence. C'est année, c'est au tour de Simonetta Somaruga (PS) et l'année dernière c'était Didier Burkhalter (PLR).  Il faut aussi noter que le chef d'état de la Suisse n'est pas le président, mais bien le Conseil Fédéral au complet.  Les 7 membres sont choisi selon une règle non-écrite, la fameuse ""formule magique"": 2 sièges au Conseil Fédéral pour les 3 plus grands partis, et 1 pour le quatrième. Elle n'est pas respectée (à peu de choses près) en ce moment, mais c'est une longue histoire pourquois.  Et maintenant les partis politiques:  Le PDC (CVP en allemand) est l'ancien parti catholique. Il est surtout de gauche mais conservateur, présent dans les régions rurales. Son thème de prédilection est la famille (couple hétéro avec des enfants, il faut préciser) et qu'elle devrait recevoir plus de subvensions, etc.   Le PLR (FDP en allemand) est le résultat de la fusion des partis libéraux et radicaux. C'est un parti centré sur l'économie, mais assez de droite quand aux questions sociales.  Le PS (SP en allemand) était pendant un temps le ""parti d'opposition"", avant que ce titre ne lui soit dérobé par l'UDC. C'est un parti socialiste tout ce qu'il y a de plus classique: augmentation de l'aide sociale, de l'éducation, etc.  L'UDC (SVP en allemand) est ... un cas un peu spécial. Il y a 25 ans c'était encore le parti paysan et rural, mais depuis l'arrivée de Christophe Blocher & co. aux commandes, c'est devenu un parti avec un mono-thème quasi obsesionnel: la diminution des immigrants en Suisse. Je n'en dirais plus parce que je suis assez biaisé sur la question, mais ils sont assez controversés en Suisse.  Ensuite, il y a les Verts, le PBD, les Vert'libéraux, le Parti Evangélique et tout une série d'autres petits partis sur lesquels je reviendrais quand j'aurais plus de temps  Edit: grammaire"
Switzerland,3cynx3,Aethec,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:52:38 2015 UTC,"Vert'libéraux c'est les Verts qui ont fusionné avec le PLR? Pourquoi la composition du conseil fédéral c'est 1 PBD,2 PLR,2 PS,1 et 1 UDC pourquoi l'UDC a-t-il 1 siège?"
Switzerland,3cynx3,Aethec,2,Sun Jul 12 18:32:26 2015 UTC,"La composition historique du Conseil Fédéral était liée à la force respective des partis au Parlement. Avec le temps s'est imposée une ""formule magique"" qui respectait ça : 2 PLR, 2 PDC, 2 PS, 1 UDC. Un des principes du Conseil Fédéral est la collégialité : tous les conseillers soutiennent les décisions prises par la majorité du Conseil indépendamment de leur opinion personnelle. Par exemple, un/e conseiller/ère fédéral/e PLR doit s'exprimer en faveur d'un agrandissement de l'État si c'est l'opinion majoritaire, même s'il/elle est évidemment contre.  Mais le PDC a perdu des voix, et l'UDC en a gagné jusqu'à devenir le premier parti de Suisse. Menée par Blocher, l'UDC a réussi à prendre un des sièges PDC.    Ce changement était bien en théorie, vu que l'UDC le méritait de par ses voix, mais Blocher, qui s'est du coup retrouvé au conseil fédéral, énervait passablement de monde, non seulement de par ses positions extrémistes mais surtout par son non-respect de la collégialité. Blocher a ouvertement pris position contre les autres conseillers.  En 2007, la gauche réussit à convaincre une majorité du Parlement qu'il faut éjecter Blocher (fait rare; normalement, la réélection est une formalité). Se pose alors la question de par qui le remplacer. Il faut que ce soit un/e UDC, pour respecter la formule magique (sans quoi l'élection aurait eu l'air d'une prise de pouvoir de la gauche, qui n'aurait donc pas eu assez de voix). Une candidate idéale est trouvée : Evelyn Widmer-Schlumpf, membre UDC du gouvernement des Grisons et fille de l'ancien conseiller fédéral Leon Schlumpf. Après plusieurs tours, elle est finalement élue, éjectant ainsi Blocher et rejoignant Samuel Schmid, l'autre conseiller UDC (mais datant d'avant Blocher, donc non extrémiste). L'UDC n'accepte pas ce résultat, et contraint Widmer-Schlumpf à refuser son élection faute d'expulsion de son parti. Widmer-Schlumpf accepte son élection malgré ces menaces.  Résultat des courses, Widmer-Schlumpf et Schmid sortent de l'UDC et rejoignent le PBD, parti nouvellement créé des UDC ""centristes"" opposés à la ligne Blocher. Il n'y a donc aucun UDC au Conseil Fédéral.  En 2008, Schmid annonce sa démission en invoquant des raisons de santé; l'UDC choisit Ueli Maurer et Christoph Blocher comme candidats à sa succession. (il est courant pour un parti de choisir plusieurs candidats et de laisser le Parlement décider) Aucun autre parti ne veut soutenir Blocher, mais Maurer passe après plusieurs tours, avec à peine une voix de plus que le deuxième candidat, Hansjörg Walter, autre UDC qui avait pourtant annoncé qu'il refuserait son élection le cas échéant. Un front anti-Blocher voulait quand même l'élire pour éviter Maurer.  En 2011, malgré les protestations de l'UDC, Widmer-Schlumpf est réélue. Le Conseil Fédéral contient donc 2 PLR, 2 PS, 1 UDC, 1 PBD, 1 PDC, malgré le fait que l'UDC est le premier parti en terme de voix et que le PBD n'a pas assez de voix pour théoriquement pouvoir prétendre à un siège."
Switzerland,3cynx3,Lejeune_Dirichelet,2,Sun Jul 12 20:10:01 2015 UTC,"Pour ce qui est Verts'libéraux, c'est un parti assez nouveau fait pour plaire aux électeurs qui préfèrent une économie libérale mais veulent les positions écologiques des Verts (qui ont les positions économiques du PS). Je ne sais pas s'il y a des transfuges des Verts ou du PLR dans leur rangs, ça ne m'étonnerait pas. En pratique, ils siphonnent surtout des voix aux Verts, leur pari est donc réussi. Encore faut-il qu'ils fassent quelque chose; pour l'instant, la seule fois où j'en ai entendu parler c'est quand ils se sont exprimés pour le mariage gay."
Switzerland,3cynx3,Lejeune_Dirichelet,2,Sun Jul 12 20:12:46 2015 UTC,"Non, les Vert'libéraux n'ont pas fusionnés avec des PLR: c'est un Vert Zürichois, Martin Bäumle, qui était d'accord avec les Vert sur les questions écologiques mais les trouvaient trop à gauche sur les autres issues. Il a donc créé son propre parti, qui se place entre le PLR et le PDC au Parlement.  Maintenant la raison pourquoi les PBDs tiennent un siège de l'UDC au Conseil Fédéral...  Il y a encore 25 ans, l'UDC était le 4ème parti de Suisse (donc avait 1 siège), et le reste du Conseil Fédéral était sous le monopole du PS, PDC et PRD (les Radicaux, un des prédécesseurs avec les Libéraux du PLR actuel).  Comme je l'avais dit plus haut, c'est environ à cette époque que Blocher & co sont arrivés au pouvoir et ont transformé l'UDC, principalement agrarien à l'époque, en un parti presque exclusivement anti-immigration.  La montée en puissance à été fulgurante, devenant rapidement premier parti de Suisse aux élections de 1999. Le reste de l'establishment politique en était assez mécontent car c'était devenus un parti très populiste (à la limite démagogue) et se voyait comme un parti ""d'opposition"" - ce qui passe assez mal dans un pays qui pratique la démocratie de consensus.  Ils ont réclamés leurs dû aux élections de 2003 en demandant un siège additionnel. Les autres partis ont alors fait confiance à ""l'effet Zempf"": leur offrir un siège au Conseil Fédéral dans l'espoir que mieux intégrer le parti dans la vie politique le calme un peu (ça avait marché en 1891). La PDC Ruth-Metzler en a fait les frais et n'a pas été réélue (une vrai tragédie à mon avis) et Blocher a été élu conseiller fédéral.  Mais malheureusement, l'effet Zempf n'a pas du tout marché: le parti est resté à l'écart, s’offusquant de tout ce qui ne fonctionnais pas et accusant le reste du monde politique (avec les étrangers) d'en être la cause à tout les coups, etc... Il y avait aussi des rumeurs que Blocher lui-même était insupportable, et que les autres conseillers fédéraux s'en étaient plaints en privés auprès de leurs chefs de partis respectifs.  Tout cela a conduit à ce que juste avant la réélection du Conseil Fédéral en 2007 à la surprise générale, une coalition des grands partis empêche sa réélection (!) et choisit une candidate (Grisonne) beaucoup plus modérée à sa place, Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf.  Il faut comprendre qu'il n'y a eu que 4 non-réélection depuis la fondation de la Suisse moderne, et que 2 d'entre elles (comme celle de Ruth Metzler) étaient dû à une mauvaise performance de leurs partis. C'était donc une énorme insulte personnelle envers Blocher (bien fait pour lui ).  Sans surprise, Blocher était absolument furieux. Et comme un parti n'a pas le droit d'expulser un membre individuel, l'UDC à expulser la section entière de l'UDC des Grisons pour punir Widmer-Schlumpf d'avoir accepté le poste. Celle-ci a ripostée en fondant le PBD des Grison.   Samuel Schmidt, a l'époque l'autre conseiller fédéral UDC, avait refuser de laisser la place à Blocher lors de l'élection et a en conséquence été ostracisé par son propre parti, même publiquement appelé ""quasiment cliniquement mort"". Il a démissionné l'année prochaine a fondé la section PBD de Berne avec d'autres anciens de l'UDC bernoise.  Widmer-Schlumpf est actuellement encore conseillère fédérale, et le seul rempart contre un deuxième siège UDC. Mais sa ré-election en fin d'année est assez incertaine."

Switzerland,3cynx3,SatoyS,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:48:47 2015 UTC,"Absolument pas! Les candidats sont généralement des politiciens assez obscures qui ont une solide expérience dans un conseil d'état cantonal (c'est un peu comme le Conseil Fédéral d'un canton), ou au moins dans une administration; et étaient parlementaires à un moment de leurs vies. Les chefs de partis feraient pour la plupart de bons candidats, mais ils ne sont pas tous vraiment disposés à remettre leurs point de vue en question (et donc pas très commode pour travailler avec), et ils ont probablement déjà autant de pouvoir en tant que chef de parti que conseiller fédéral...  Et pendant leur mandat, il est absolument exclus qu'ils cumulent des casquettes de conseiller fédéral et d'une position importante dans leur parti. La soif de pouvoir, c'est très mal vu en Suisse... C'est d’ailleurs une chose de plus qu'on a reprocher à Blocher: officiellement, Ueli Maurer était chef de parti pendant son mandat, mais beaucoup de gens pensaient qu'il tirait encore trop de ficelles officieusement."

Switzerland,3cxjd2,as-well,4,Sun Jul 12 21:24:08 2015 UTC,"Let's get this straight. Every dialect has a horrible version somewhere. Sometimes, I cringe too when I hear a certain kind of fellow Thurgauer. But I also cringe in Züri sometimes. Or that old farmer dude in Kandersteg who kept calling me ""Jüngling"" and who I could hardly understand. Not every Thurgauer sounds horrible when they speak, as there is no ""Thurgauer Dialekt"". Most people can't even tell where I'm from, they think I'm from St.Gallen. That is proof that people have no idea what they're hating on.  There have however been studies suggesting that it is disliked because unlike many other dialects it doesn't roll the R and it has many open vowels, which apparently (just google it, can't find the link now) makes people sound more feminine. Not my opinion, but some linguist thought that.  Here is an interesting article: http://mobile2.tagesanzeiger.ch/articles/28206022"
Switzerland,3cxjd2,Motzlord,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:08:58 2015 UTC,"Open vowels makes people sound feminine? That's odd, since front and closed vowels are usually associated with smallness and ""good"" and back and open ones with largeness and ""bad""."

This absolute ear-bleeding fiasko is only interrupted by the worst kind of wanna-be funny-guy people there are: radio moderators and dumbed down local advertising. Radio nrj (energy) is a leading artist in this abomination. It's the absolute abyss. The niveau is never any higher than jokes about flatulation and some random grunting.

Switzerland,3crx9b,contradicts_herself,3,Fri Jul 10 07:42:05 2015 UTC,"Basel has a fireworks display on the night of the 31st (!!!) on the Rhein so don't miss that one. Best view is probably from Mittlere Brücke.  Zürich has its fireworks on the lake and you probably have the best view from a private balcony on the lake site. Second best is probably from Züriberg or Uetliberg. If you're at the lake site you will have to trouble yourself with a crowd. Apparently not on the first of August.  But honestly, when you've seen fireworks in Basel, it doesn't make sense to see them again in Zürich.. it's just fireworks after all. Sure, it's well choreographed and stuff, but maybe you'd be interested in a more traditional celebration. I don't really have tips for those however."

Switzerland,3cl8ve,Canlox,8,Wed Jul 8 19:56:36 2015 UTC,"The difference can be huge.  If you know Hebrew and Deutsch, you may understand far more Yiddish than you'd understand Schweizerdeutsch.  There are significant differences to the grammar used, significant differences to the pronunciation, entirely different words that can be used (borrowed, novel, or possibly considered archaic), and different styles, and all of these can change from region to region.  Since it's written phonetically, you'll see the spelling of a word change depending on which area of Switzerland it's from.  And even within a certain area, some people might choose one non-standard orthography, while others might choose another non-standard orthography, so the same word with the same pronunciation might be written differently by two different people who come from the same place.  I'd recommend checking out all of her videos for an idea of what Züridüütsch can be like, understanding that it can be quite different than in other regions.  Her videos are based on outright teaching of the language, rather than comparing to standard Deutsch, so you won't necessarily preceive the huge difference unless you're already quite proficient in Deutsch."

They don't necessarily change with canton borders, sometimes the places a certain dialect is spoken are much smaller.  There are dialects with more french/italian words, for example Berndeutsch has quite a few of them."

Switzerland,3cewt0,swisslife4ever,4,Tue Jul 7 12:40:34 2015 UTC,Because stores make so much money here in CH annd they dont care to keep up stocks and antecipate shortages. They dont need to take care of the costumers.  Here in GE is the same thing no ventilators or climatisators available anywhere.
Switzerland,3cewt0,canteloupy,2,Tue Jul 7 11:22:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever seen something like this, that an entire range of products is out of stock in the whole country. Guess they were really surprised by the heatwave.  I believe electronics have to be specifically ordered and manufactured for Switzerland because of the weird plug we use. Probably have to order them weeks, or rather months, in advance. Maybe in the EU you don't have the problem since you can buy up the stock of another country?"
Switzerland,3cewt0,swisslife4ever,3,Tue Jul 7 11:41:30 2015 UTC,"I dont know. From my experience with shopping here it is always the same with any kind of products. Oh, you want to buy that brand of greek yoghourt that sells the most but we have a very limit number of them in stock ? Guess what, fuck you even tho it has been like this for years. you can buy the other brands because that one specifically you can only find at Coop and if we dont have it, noboby else does.  Hmm, this winter we will have some bad snow storms (as warned) and you need to drive/bus somewhere, well fuck you we didnt buy enough salt to take care of the road because that one guy with the shovel at the intersection will do all the work.  Ah yes, you want to buy a bike in november? Screw you, we only sell snow equipment now. Lol  This heatwave now was announced a couple of weeks before, each summer i see the same thing.  This is how things work in CH. You just need to get used to the fuck you thingy and all is good. :D"

Switzerland,3cewt0,Urgullibl,4,Tue Jul 7 14:49:52 2015 UTC,"Since you lived here all your life you probably don't really see it. I for  one am always shocked at how often you go to a restaurant that advertises a product and they just ran out. Like, it's not that hard to just keep making pies, or keep track of the sales of spinach crepes and get more spinach instead of saying ""oh yeah those are always out first"". Or a clothing store and they had like 2 of that size. It's like there's not really pressure to sell more. It's not the same in all countries."
Switzerland,3cewt0,SwissBliss,2,Tue Jul 7 17:59:55 2015 UTC,"Hm, you might be right about it, now that I think about it.  Could it be that shops and restaurants in other countries buy a bigger stock, but also throw away more (or use them older than Swiss busineesses do / may)? Maybe because the prices here are higher, Restaurants don't want to throw out food?"
Switzerland,3cewt0,wheezzl,2,Tue Jul 7 21:27:49 2015 UTC,"Could be, definitely, that there is also more to lose here. But it's still strange and feels like they don't really need to try very hard.

I plan one day to have a business here and wonder if I can adapt to the Swiss way of doing business while also bringing some of the U.S. style into it"
Switzerland,3cewt0,sartsch,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:34:36 2015 UTC,"I think that good customer service should still be a bit more than what you're describing. I think many people here also are complacent because they are very secure. On the one hand that's a good thing, and I hate the tipping culture and the constant customer harassment that is the small talk and compulsive checking-if-everything-is-fine that US waiters and retail employees are known for. I think it's annoying that that the defensive attitude of ""customer is always right"" and pre-emptive grovelling is annoying. I've read enough tales from retail and notalwaysright to understand why they have to do this and I find that dehumanizing and like employees are abused.  On the other hand maybe they should focus a bit more on gaining a competitive advantage. The one place where they do have supply would probably become known quite fast. Also restaurants stop selling food at 10PM exactly, croissants run out around 8:30AM, etc, then they complain about the competition from McDonald's and gas stations and supermarkets. What's really stopping them from having stock or service? So yeah, it's a bit too strict sometimes. I think there's a balance to be struck somewhere between employee welfare and customer service. Plus the employees from gas stations are employees too and the restaurant guy isn't better than them. As for attitudes, I think the best I've seen is basically the high end store salespeople here. They're trying to satisfy you but they're not going to get personal or annoy you with small talk. This should be the standard I think. Polite, helpful, but distant and non-intrusive. And properly paid, not abused."

Switzerland,3c9wmw,Urgullibl,7,Mon Jul 6 06:40:31 2015 UTC,"As a native Belgian in Switzerland, this is almost definitely the explanation. A majority of the complaints in Belgium about the two-language (German hardly counts) system arises from the way it separates and effectively slows down the government.  The Flemish people loathe Walloon politicians and the Walloons loathe Flemish politicians. Not only do the people in both areas support very different political leanings (Flanders is far more fiscally conservative and pro-business, like the Dutch; Wallonia is more socialist), they rarely look eye to eye on anything.   And it just gets exacerbated because both halves of the country preach those differences from their side's political pulpits. Two big echo chambers shouting at each other, hardly able to reconcile a damn thing. All the while costing twice as much and being twice as slow because there's two separate governments."
Switzerland,3c9wmw,I_AM_STILL_A_IDIOT,2,Mon Jul 6 12:07:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying, but I think it's more the political culture than the system. It'd be entirely possible to build a party for e.g. Romands only, but someone who actually did that would be laughed out of the parliament; the feelings between cultures aren't strong enough to be used by populists."

Switzerland,3c9wmw,Urgullibl,17,Mon Jul 6 10:58:34 2015 UTC,"I personally believe this is a great achievement of those efforts made in the 19th century to give Switzerland some kind of romanticized national narrative. By now, in the mind of its inhabitants, Switzerland is an aggregation of small states bound together in the common purpose of staying independent from the greater neighboring states, which at times is not too far from the truth :)  In the end, this kind of mentality combined with a strong federal system in which many decisions are taken at the municipal and cantonal level and cantons are to be seen as equals means that you have entire regions/cantons doing their own thing, more or less. This can be generalized to the linguistic regions: each of us is doing more or less their own thing and only collaborate when it is required. The rest of the time, we try not to step on each others' feet.  Both the historical/national narrative and political system are fairly different from what you'll see in Belgium and Canada. In both, you will find a majority that threw/throws around its weight and brought down or stifled a minority for a few centuries. This led to the emergence of separate nationalistic movements for the different language areas whereas Switzerland managed to make its national narrative include all of them."
Switzerland,3c9wmw,Tefal,12,Mon Jul 6 11:47:12 2015 UTC,"Why should we have conflicts in the first place?  I say it all comes down to our political system. We can voice our opinion on a regular basis, opinion which is always respected and enforced by the law. Our politicians knows this and politicians with a really huge ego tend to get shut down pretty quickly. This lead to a political environment much more able to negotiate with other parties and there is fewer escalation in case of conflict. This is a totally different culture than Belgium for example, which has been exploding for years now. Belgium is a perfect example of a country similar in size and in language diversity to Switzerland but which failed miserably because of the weaknesses of the classic political system."
Switzerland,3c9wmw,roscocoltrane,8,Mon Jul 6 10:43:50 2015 UTC,"Very true. A major step towards the breakdown of Belgium was made some years ago when federal elections were restricted to region and thus no longer applied to the whole of the country. So someone living in Dutch-speaking Flanders could not vote for a French-speaking politician (and vice versa), even if this politician would rule on a nation-wide level. Populist politicians quickly cashed in on this new situation. They could now blame the other language group for all woes that befell the country, knowing full well that they wouldn't get punished in the next election. If a politician would blame pensioners, the working-class, etc. he would pay the price for this by not getting any support from these groups. But it's very easy to put the blame on a group that's not part of your voter base. It's a win-win situation for populist and separatist politicians, leading to a spiraling effect that does not look like it is going to end anytime soon."
Switzerland,3c9wmw,zoetzuur,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:13:18 2015 UTC,That is an excellent point.
Switzerland,3c9wmw,Urgullibl,2,Mon Jul 6 11:46:33 2015 UTC,"Entirely true! Though there is some saber rattling going on in parliament, the Swiss political system - especially at the federal level - heavily emphasizes finding a consensus and working together towards an actual solution instead of stroking the egos of those involved. It makes the decision process longer and the decisions much less radical than what you'd see in systems where a ruling majority/coalition dictates their law and ignores the opposition, but IMO it allows parliaments to do what they are elected for in the first place, and do it well.  BTW, living in Germany and looking at how the Bundestag has become a gigantic circlejerk in which the opposition is treated as a minor inconvenience has reinforced that opinion of mine. Switzerland, though it has its flaws, is one of the few truly functioning democracies on Earth."
Switzerland,3c9wmw,Tefal,2,Mon Jul 6 17:14:27 2015 UTC,It's not just that elected politicians do this out of their own good faith -- the threat of referenda and initiatives is definitely a contributing factor.
Switzerland,3c9wmw,Urgullibl,5,Tue Jul 7 20:17:19 2015 UTC,"That depends. Foreigners can't imagine that 30km is way far out there for locals here. So if the language border is right beside you, you don't care, because you don't work there.  Otoh, Swiss SME are very international. So a Wälsch/Swiss French speaking also speaks English and no friction there.   In the military, it is courtesy to speak French if one Russian, cough, French speaking service man is present. This is custom and nice, but also important. You want them to feel welcomed and really a part of all.   An example: There are many living in Geneva or Basel who never heard a speak of Rumantsch, and there are a few also who never where in the Italian dialects part of Switzerland. Now that mobility grows, there are more threats to social coherence, paradoxically. But we will get around those too, we absorbed hundred thousands of foreign speaking social bodies (migrant waves, neighboring migration etc.). So it will work out somehow. Also, those foreigners settling here see that you don't have to cudgel somebody just because he speaks a different tongue. That and the fact that a lot of immigrants already speak a Latin language helps them to acquire two more while residing here. (Brasilians learn French faster while being in St. Gallen e.g.)."
Switzerland,3c9wmw,oelsen,6,Mon Jul 6 10:26:26 2015 UTC,"And if you happen to be from the italian speaking part you just smile and nod. Atleast thats what my recruits did, I still have no idea who thought it would be a good idea to give them to a german speaking platoon. Communication was pretty funny..."
Switzerland,3c9wmw,idgafbob,2,Mon Jul 6 10:36:40 2015 UTC,"I have to ask, you know what Russian in this context means, right?   Because a true Nazi would speak in his mothertongue as fast and weird as possible :)"

Switzerland,3c9wmw,oelsen,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:41:59 2015 UTC,But it doesn't explain why there are conflicts in Belgium. I'm sure there are plenty of French speaking Belgian than were never confronted to flamand speaking Belgian.
Switzerland,3c9wmw,roscocoltrane,2,Mon Jul 6 11:04:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say we're still quite federal and it allows cantons to mind their own business (sometimes within cantons there are language conflicts: BE-JU)... traditionally, the only time the average male had/has to be exposed to the other language(s) is military service, and it obviously has a robust ""frame"".  CH used to be more ""local"" but this is obviously lessening. I'm not sure about the future. right now, the situation is peaceful, the country is prosper, not much neighbor hate (haters will rather direct it at other groups). as a reminder, 19th-century CH had a civil war between catholics/conservatives and reformed/progressives (not between language groups!). my grandparents (born ~1930) would find it ""funnier"" if I married a catholic than a Swiss-German.  the way I see it, the fact that the majority has German as official language also helps:   it's also foreign to them (they speak dialects), I find Swiss-Germans linguistically very open post-WW2 German culture (which affects German-speaking CH) is rather chill, IMO   yet another thing I could mention: we do have tensions, but they're quite weak so far. as I wrote, I'm not sure about how it will evolve. making sure the population is taught national languages is important and not easy.  EDIT: the ""cause jurassienne"" conflict may actually be driven by other motives than language... does someone know if cantons such as BE, FR, VS or GR have had or could be having something reminiscent of a language conflict?"
Switzerland,3c9wmw,leo_037,3,Mon Jul 6 11:21:14 2015 UTC,"At least GR doesn’t have a language conflict at all — we love the fact that we have more languages than any other canton :).   However, I assume that the Italian speakers are slightly less happy than the other two groups — Romansh gets a lot of funding to stay alive, and most romansh speakers are bilingual anyway, while Italian speakers must often learn German to get a good job. But it doesn’t feel to me like the few Italian speakers I know hold any grudges."
Switzerland,3c9wmw,BoneHead777,2,Tue Jul 7 05:31:02 2015 UTC,"If BE-JU were a language conflict, the three southern districts wouldn't have voted to remain part of BE, and Laufon wouldn't have voted to leave. It's more of a religious-and-historical-borders type thing.  As for the military, I thought of that, too; however, Belgium has only recently abolished mandatory service, so it can't be just that."
Switzerland,3c9wmw,Urgullibl,2,Mon Jul 6 10:48:03 2015 UTC,"I reckon some of it comes from a (not all that serious) smug sense of superiority towards the Germans/French/Italians that our country runs better. Everyone would rather be Swiss than join any of the countries where ""their"" language is spoken. The political system and culture that generally values compromise more than others also help.  That said, a big reason this is possible is all that sweet sweet MONAAAY. Make the economic situation bad enough and like all humans we'll probably remember what makes us different pretty quick."
Switzerland,3cbqix,Kujakape,4,Mon Jul 6 17:53:19 2015 UTC,"Chäserrugg, Hoher Kasten and Ebenalp are excellent alternatives to the Säntis. Hoher Kasten and Ebenalp are both closer to Altstätten and cheaper, the Chäserrugg offers better views though (imo). From the Ebenalp, you can easily access the famous Aescher Restaurant and the gorgeous Seealpsee, and the Hoher Kasten lies close to the Sämtisersee (you can take a swim in either if you want to cool down).  Zürich Zoo is a bit far away. You might want to take a look at the Walter Zoo in Gossau SG instead.  Another nice place in St. Gallen is Drei Weieren, a few ponds just above the city, where you can chill and take a swim.  If you want to go shopping, a place I can recommend you is the Shopping Arena in Winkeln, which is a suburb of St. Gallen.  Edit: How could I forget about the Kronberg? You can try the Kronberg Alpine Coaster or the Rope Park, both of which I can absolutely recommend."

Those lakes look fantastic, we will definitely visit those! Shopping arena is must go aswell, parents used to live close to it so i've been there few times.   I have to pick up my SO from Zurich Airport as she is flying week after me there, so we figured that Zurich Zoo would be good place to visit while at Zurich anyways. Would you still recommend Walter Zoo over Zurich one?"
Switzerland,3cbqix,TangoWhisky,2,Mon Jul 6 20:33:02 2015 UTC,Zurich zoo is definitely worth a visit! Walter zoo is nice as well but smaller and less diverse. The question is is it in your situation feasible to drive about 1.5h each way to Zurich zoo. It is worth the drive though if it fits your plan.  LethalPuppy's recommendations are spot on for the St. Gallen area.  Other nice places within reasonable distance are the Walensee or the Pizol mountain area which has a nice hiking trail.  The Heidi village is popular amongst my foreign visitors (altough personally I like the surrounding scenery better)  From Altstätten you are also only a short drive away from Bregenz and other nice villages at the Lake Constance or Feldkirch.
Switzerland,3cbqix,kosta_kaylee,2,Tue Jul 7 08:22:33 2015 UTC,"I would definitely head to Zurich Zoo rather than Walter Zoo. They have a new elephant enclosure that's certainly worth seeing, plus the wonderful Masuala Hall. In this weather the tropical climate in there will probably be a nice way to cool off. If you like wildlife you could also visit SeaLife in Konstanz."

Referendums are serious things that need to be planned in advance and you need to take the time to formulate the issue you want to vote on in a clear and concise way (that voting ballot the Greeks are using would be better in a greek tragedy than in real life). You also need to give the people time to debate the issue, to ponder the consequences and not rush them at mach 10 through the most important decision of their lifetimes.  That people call it a testament to democracy is the insult added to the injury. It's a travesty, a sham and Tsipras should be ashamed for even thinking it up! Any Swiss politician proposing such a referendum would be sternly dismissed as a lunatic.  I'd feel pity for the Greeks were it not for the fact that this is exactly what they wanted when they elected Tsipras: Grandstanding, a lot of arrogant preaching, warm air but very little concret change. That referendum fits perfectly in that context.  The Greeks liked to think they could impose their will on the rest of Europe, I fear they'll soon learn that this illusion is just that, an illusion. A lesson we Swiss might be wise to learn too."

Why must everybody be so stupid and not recognize the intellectual superiority of the well-informed. It's just so annoying to have to answer to the voters.  Let's be honest for a moment here: The minaret vote is a straw man. Its political consequences are minimal.

Today in Switzerland the popular vote could theoretically roll back civil rights for some people and it's ridiculous that we pretend there is something inherently good about that kind of system.

The Greeks will vote for or against Europe or the sanctions or whatever, but these gangsters (Germans, French, Greeks...) will have their ways, and this crypto-fascist, oligarchic ""Union"" will do according to the will of its only god, the market, and its ""son on earth"", money.

D'ailleurs on verra bien combien de temps il faudra pour qu'on vote pour le mariage homosexuel...   Pas longtemps, vu que c'est environ la nouvelle religion et que les idéalistes gauchistes en sont les nouveaux pasteurs. Mais je veux pas remettre en cause les privilèges idéologiques qui sont les tiens."

Switzerland,3c6nr2,caoimhin22,3,Sun Jul 5 12:26:54 2015 UTC,Blausee and Oeschinensee are both in Bernese Oberland and would probably suit your needs.
Switzerland,3c6nr2,Urgullibl,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:09:32 2015 UTC,Already checked them out. Blausee is not convenient as it is forbidden to swim due to fish protection and Oeschinensee is just too far away by car and too touristic to shoot there :)  But thanks anyway. Visually these are the most beautiful lakes..
Switzerland,3c6nr2,Urgullibl,2,Mon Jul 6 10:29:54 2015 UTC,Arnensee/Lac d'Arnon comes to mind. You can drive there on a toll road.

Switzerland,3c6nr2,stabmeinthehat,2,Mon Jul 6 23:25:06 2015 UTC,"Map: there you go. If you're in Lausanne, it's a 90 minute drive. Not much of a crowd during weekdays either.  And yeah, it's definitely pretty clear."
Switzerland,3c7u8f,mcrae44,3,Sun Jul 5 18:37:35 2015 UTC,"Read through the hundreds of other immigration threads (or at least a few of them). You'll see that being from a non-EU country means that your employer has to prove that they can't get get a similarly skilled worker from either Switzerland or EU. Together with this:   i'm not an engineer   and    I only speak english.   I'd say your chances are practically zero. But: I don't know anything about the civil engineering field, so take this as you want."
Switzerland,3c7u8f,chmod0755,3,Sun Jul 5 20:20:27 2015 UTC,"lol. thanks for giving it to me straight at least!  help at all if my girlfriend is swiss? i mean, if we marry?"
Switzerland,3c7u8f,buyacasha,3,Sun Jul 5 20:22:52 2015 UTC,Well then you'll get the visa of course as far as I know.
Switzerland,3c7u8f,as-well,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:47:43 2015 UTC,"You won't have a work permit problem, which otherwise is almost impossible to obtain for you. Switzerland lets only a handful (read: less than 5000) non-EU migrants in based on jobs - so without being married, obtaining a work permit is almost impossible.   Your problem will, however, be that the Swiss job market is rather focused on diplomas. Even if you find an English-speaking company, they can probably get someone with a three or even five year diploma. So finding a job will be rather hard for you. But do try!"
Switzerland,3c7u8f,YeaISeddit,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:49:46 2015 UTC,"Without being married,  I imagine you have to find a company that wants you,  and the company has to sponsor you for one?

Switzerland,3c7u8f,YeaISeddit,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:01:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, although the company could sponsor you and the migrationsamt could turn down the work permit anyways. Even large companies with a lot of influence are having problems with the quotas."

I worked at both of them for hours, usually in the morning, without problems. I could imagine though that it might be a bit more diffcult in the afternoons, when both cafés tend to be rather crowded.

But you can do it at home!  Just make sure, to keep the heat out of your house/flat! Open the windows during nighttime and use the window shutter during daytime (block the sun from the inside won't do the job). When you are having trouble with mosquitoes install some nets to keep them out. And don't underestimate how much heat the electronic devices produce, it would be a good idea to turn them off! With this strategy you be able to survive the few hot days.  You could also buy an AC, but this is nonsense here in Switzerland. It is easy to survive the few hot days we have without one. I am normally not a environmentalist, but AC are just a waste of electricity. With all the ""2000 Watt society"" discussions it seems immoderate to me to use a machine that uses nearly half of that..."

I wouldn't talk much about eating though because you can eat wherever you want (the ""Va Piano"" near bel air is nice if you like italian food,;or go at the Molard and you will have choice in between italian food and beer). The Rue de l'école de médecine at Plainpalais is full of bars and usually crowded if you want to have a drink.

Switzerland,3bus3f,Elmarco84,2,Thu Jul 2 16:21:55 2015 UTC,"The concerts are completely free and located outside in a park. You have to walk a few meters from the concert zone to go to the park, but from 7-8 pm it's SUPER crowded, as in, you literally have to queue over 50m. But after you're there, you just find a spot on the grass and enjoy the concerts, if possible not behind the big tree; they usually have an excellent program, even if it's for free.   Note that the park is on a slope, and usually pot smokers (which sometimes includes musicians) go on top of the slope where it's a little discreet.   Also, the booze is quite expensive, so try to take your own. But there is plenty of food all around: sausages, asian, kebabs, mexican, everything (but at MJF prices, which are the swissest of Swiss prices).   Finally, the toilets are at the park itself. They're horrendous but well, that's what it is. If you're a girl (and even a bloke) prepare to queue--again.   Once you're there, just try to stay where you are and make sure you have everything with you, kind of like in a camping trip, because going to a food shop 15 meters away and come back will take you like 45 minutes."

There are also 19 other courses dealing with Swiss cuisine on there (unfortunately the search results are not linkable) stretching from Berne to Chur.

Visit an alp, spend a night in the hut, help the herdsman milking his cows and watch him making fine Swiss cheese. While you probably won't learn a lot for your professional life it will be a great experience and make you appreciate again something as simple as cheese.  To be honest, I have no idea how you would start. Probably those guys here know more. In last few years lots of people from the cities (and even abroad) started to work as herdsmen. So there will be people who speak English."

Switzerland,3bnupg,quimsonquimsonquims,4,Tue Jun 30 19:44:33 2015 UTC,"I think that's actually a good thing to do because you could split up gun violence in two parts:   1) Gun crimes committed by healthy, moderately wealthy people. Scenarios like someone breaks into your house or tries to mug you in a dark street -- in the US you can shoot them, but not in Switzerland [""tödliche Notwehr"" very rarely justified, not being allowed to carry outside etc.] so small differences in regulations can change a lot in gun ""culture"". However, since you're allowed to keep it with ammo, it's often used in domestic violence.  --> mostly dependent on gun regulations  2) Youth/Inner city/Immigrant/Poverty criminality. Immigrants from certain countries are not allowed to have a gun and the strict carrying laws are not really a deterrent for some criminals to get a gun. More important is how far they'd go for a robbery/dispute/mugging etc., and in Switzerland you should be enough well off to not have to resort to murder.   --> social issues [social security, mental health treatment, oppression] more important than gun regulations  Obviously he didn't have that in mind it just bugs me when americans use Switzerland as an example to say guns are not even a tiny problem. Sorry for the rant"
Switzerland,3bnupg,cazz14159,3,Tue Jun 30 21:35:30 2015 UTC,What? I didn't know Switzerland denied gun ownership to certain minorities. The US would have a seizure if a politician even suggested that.

But I'm sure there are plenty of day trains as well, which would enable you to stop.

I asked if anything else changed (b/c it sounded too good to be true). They confirmed it didn't. So I obliged.   Next month I find out that I do have unlimited data but lost the 150MB of roaming. Considering I go into France once in a while I was charged 60CHF for 25 MB of roaming.   Thankfully Salt admitted to their mistake (that the rep wasn't aware that I'd lose the roaming) and credited me the fee, but once I asked to be put back on my original plan of 150MB roaming they declined, saying they don't offer that deal anymore, but I can add some ""GO"" plan for only 20 CHF a month.

You know this thing hasn't just been invented and there have been exabytes of information on it for the last decades, right? Finding general information about any country is probably the easiest thing to do on the internet. It's one thing to ask for clarification from insiders - food, religion, social rules - but just ""tell me about your country""? This isn't some special knowledge only 20 people know about, nothing of the likes of ""how do gravitational waves influence MRI scans if lagrange point n lies between the sun and the moon and neptune and pluto are aligned?""

Switzerland,3blyy5,P1r4nha,2,Tue Jun 30 08:45:56 2015 UTC,"I wrote this in another post, but this is a little summary of what Switzerland is.   Very rich country, one of the highest standards of living in the world. If I remember correctly it's considered by research to be the best place to be born, best place for expats, and the happiest nation in the world, as well as many other great things. Very beautiful country and high in tourism. We have lots of lakes and mountains, and for a relatively small country, the weather and climate is fairly different in different regions of the country. The two major cities are Geneva and Zurich, and then we have big cities like Bern, Basel, Lausanne, Lugano etc... We have 4 national languages, Swiss German, French, Italian, Romansch. We have 26 cantons, which are similar to states in the US. We have a strong democracy where swiss people can vote often. We are surrounded by Italy, France, Germany, Liechtenstein, and Austria, the biggest border is Italy to the south. We don't have the sea, but driving to it isn't that far, and we are centrally located in Europe, and the world really, which is good for travel. We voted not to be in the European Union, so we have our own currency, not the Euro, and a few other things. We are neutral, so we don't take parts in wars or conflicts, but all Swiss men must do army training for a few months (not you don't worry). People are pretty humble and shy sometimes, but it depends on where you are in the country.  I don't know where in Switzerland you're from, so that changes some things. Usually it's considered that the french speaking side (Geneva for example) is more liberal, and more international (Geneva has the UN, ILO, Red Cross, WHO, WTO, etc etc etc), and some very very top universities and schools. Culture changes depending on where you are.  The food is good, but fairly simple. We're very famous for Chocolate (Toblerone, Lindt, etc.) and Cheese (Fondue, Gruyere, Raclette etc.). Again, it's a very international place.  Please ask if you have any more questions! :)"

Switzerland,3bht9a,myle,6,Mon Jun 29 11:31:06 2015 UTC,"Most Greeks are not mad at Germans. Indeed, there are some stupid right wing people (see golden dawn), but as it is usually the case, these people have not (or maybe cannot even) interact with people from other countries. The vast majority of Greeks are very friendly to tourists because they understand how much the economy depends on them. This fact runs deeply, especially in islands where you may meet many locals able to speak German. Just a day ago, the state said that tourists are excluded from the capital control imposed on Greeks. So, in conclusion, there is no reason to be afraid. Greece is still a European country, whatever happens with Euro, and Greek people are also people and pretty much everyone is happy when they see other people who enjoy things they also enjoy and moreover, help their local economy.

Switzerland,3bht9a,oelsen,3,Mon Jun 29 11:54:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's highly unlikely there will be another declared fixed exchange rate; however, there will probably be some degree of intervention should that happen.  Of course, if Greece ends up leaving the Eurozone, that would probably help the Euro's value compared to the CHF at this point, due to two reasons:   Greece leaving the Eurozone would mean that the zone's overall economic health would be better than when Greece was part of it, thus increasing confidence in the currency. There is much less exposure to Greek debt in the banking sector than there was when the crisis started, so the impact on the EU economy wouldn't be nearly as bad as it would have been five years ago."

Switzerland,3bht9a,markus_b,2,Mon Jun 29 12:13:18 2015 UTC,"No, it wouldn't. TI doesn't have its own independent fiscal policy.  The problem with the Euro isn't just that it has stronger and weaker economies using the same currency -- the same is the case with the US States and the Swiss Cantons. The problem is that each Eurozone country still wants to set its own independent fiscal policy while using a common currency."
Switzerland,3bht9a,Urgullibl,5,Mon Jun 29 13:05:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, and the fiscal policy is dominated by Germany, which is imposing a cure which makes the problem worse, not better. Greece was not in a great shape 5 years ago, but the 'cure' has brought them far enough for desperate measures now."

It sounds good to the righteous, so it gets propagated with carefully selected numbers as support."
Switzerland,3bht9a,markus_b,-1,Mon Jun 29 14:55:30 2015 UTC,"In the absence of the option of devaluing the currency, the austerity story worked quite well and was the only reasonable way to address this problem. In case you aren't familiar with him, Krugman is a rather leftist/staunchly Keynesian figure in economy, so don't expect his opinion to be neutral and his data to not be ""carefully selected"" here."
Switzerland,3bht9a,Urgullibl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:33:22 2015 UTC,"I'm fully aware of Krugman and hist position, actually I think it is a reasonable position to have and well supported by data. If you go to the world back to get the same data you'll see it is the same http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD/countries/ . I'm fully convinced that the full austerity is also the cause fro the low inflation. All southern European countries desperately need some inflation to get their costs/wages under control. As the current policy leads to deflation, this is the worst situation to be in for them.  In real economic circles his position is not exceptional, there are many economists who share his views. But there are plenty of pundits who call them economists, but actually have an agenda. They have loud voices and are well heard because they say what people want to hear, not what is fundamentally correct."
Switzerland,3bht9a,Staross,0,Mon Jun 29 15:36:24 2015 UTC,"You can of course argue that austerity didn't work, but that position is not compatible with the reality we see in the countries I mentioned. The fact that Greece is currently in deep doo-doo can be attributed to their refusal to engage in it.  Interestingly enough, when you look at Ireland and Iceland -- two countries where the crisis wasn't caused by irresponsible government policies, but reckless private banking -- it is interesting how little public uproar there was re: austerity, even though it would have been much more justified."

UNCERTAINTY    The Euro could go up, because of the lack of debt it now has.  Or it could go down on the idea that maybe Spain, Ireland, and even England could then decide to leave.  Essentially robbing the Euro of it's Continental Sovereignty...  Only time will tell...  Edit - realized I focused on the Euro and not the CHF.  I think the CHF will rise, because if the Euro goes down, the governement will have to abandon their secretive propping right now.  Which will ultimately hurt exporters and tourism..."
Switzerland,3bfdz3,your_local_redditor,7,Sun Jun 28 19:02:38 2015 UTC,"Scrap higher education expenses because ours are actually affordable. Also retirement savings are a bit different here.  we have ""säule 1"" which is AHV which is obligatory. The following link gives a pretty good overview. If you want to make sure you receive your full pension look at step 12. http://www.beobachter.ch/geld-sicherheit/ahviv/artikel/ahv_so-kommen-sie-nicht-zu-kurz/  Next we have ""säule 2"" also called ""BVG"". This one is also obligatory. Generally the employer automatically deducts it from your salary and pays it. There are different plans for this pension and they generally depend on your company and which insurer/insurance plan they use.   and then we have ""säule 3a/3b"" which are not mandatory. If you want to further invest into a retirement fund, 3a is not bad since you can deduct it from your taxes and stuff.  Disclaimer: i'm no expert on this. If you want more precise information there are plenty of good websites covering this. Go look it up.  Apart from these points there shouldn't be much of a difference to other countries."
Switzerland,3bfdz3,simluk,3,Sun Jun 28 20:15:27 2015 UTC,"Here's what you do:   If you are employed and/or recently have switched/started jobs and/or have gotten a salary raise, contact your Pensionskasse (2. Säule), tell them about your situation and ask if you can do an ""Einkauf"". Skim through the previous paperwork of your Pensionskasse and check if they even offered you an Einkauf. MAX THIS OUT IF POSSIBLE!!!! Then you inform yourself what Säule 3a is, choose a place to do the Säule 3a (high interest rate is not everything, long-term security is also important, YMMV). Then you go to this place and MAX THIS OUT GODDAMMIT! Put approx 7k in a savings and MAX OUT THE SÄULE 3a ON JANUARY 1st 2017!!!!!!

Switzerland,3bfdz3,futurespice,5,Sun Jun 28 19:52:09 2015 UTC,"The swiss version is I guess the 3a, but it works a bit differently.   Buying into the pensionskasse is normally reserved for your last few years of contributions, to offset something like paying yourself dividends from your company.   I think conventional wisdom is just to top up your 3a to the limit on tax deductibility, put some money away for emergencies (remember unemployment takes a while to kick in) and invest the rest - maybe an index fund and some bonds.

Capital gains on real estate are taxed differently though, and you may have to pay tax on those."
Switzerland,3bfdz3,buyacasha,2,Mon Jun 29 09:54:57 2015 UTC,"It's a three tier system. Säule 1 is AHV which is deducted from your salary and goes toward those that are old now, Säule 2 is also deducted from your salary but remains your own money, Säule 3a is an account you can set up at any bank. The state regulates how much you are allowed to put into it per year (Because it can be deducted from tax). There's a few scenarios where you're allowed to use that money before reaching retirement age (Buying a house for instance). Otherwise it is locked in. Säule 3b are other saving forms that you may build up over time. They are not exempt from taxes however."
Switzerland,3bfdz3,Urgullibl,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:07:11 2015 UTC,"Broadly speaking, the IRA is comparable to the 3rd column, while the 401(k) is comparable to the second column."
Switzerland,3bfdz3,Bombauer,3,Sun Jun 28 21:25:01 2015 UTC,"A few people have mentioned the Pillar 3a and I want to emphasize one point - the contribution is tax deductible, but you can also use this account towards personal property purchase. So in a way, it can technically make some of your mortgage payment 'tax deductible' in a roundabout sort of way."
Switzerland,3bfdz3,Urgullibl,2,Mon Jun 29 09:31:22 2015 UTC,"If you want to save it for retirement or eventually want to buy a house or condo, look into the 3rd column (kinda like an IRA in the US). Your bank will be able to advise you.  If you want to compare retirement systems in the US and Switzerland, you'll find that they are actually quite similar. In Switzerland, they're called ""The Three Columns""; however, each column roughly corresponds to an aspect of the US retirement system:   The First Column is AHV/AVS. This is the analog of Social Security. The Second Column is an employer-supported retirement account. This roughly corresponds to a US 401(k). The Third Column is a private tax-privileged retirement account. This roughly corresponds to an IRA."

Switzerland,3beyrf,Hippocratimus,29,Sun Jun 28 16:49:26 2015 UTC,"What country are you from?  I'd say you caught swiss culture pretty well with this   ""Why are you talking to me? Do you need something? What can I do to help?""   Especially the last two. I don't think it has anything to do with you beeing a forigner or not speaking the language. It's more that striking up a conversation with random strangers is rather unusual and maby looked at as odd. I don't think that people are averse to it, just not used to it. Normally if some random guy starts talking to you here, they ask for directions or help with something. So if you just start chatting people up, they'll expect you to want help with something and if that question doesn't come, they'll wonder why you're talking to them and when the pleasantries will end and you'll finally get to the point and ask your question.  I'd say its cultural differences. I've nice anecdote for that from a friend of mine. He and some buddies went to the US and in a restaurant some people from the table across asked them where they were from. They answered the question and continued with their meal. The Americans got upset and thought they were being impolite. They (the US people) apparently were trying to start a conversation and expecting my friend and buddies to continue talking. My friend thought they were simply asking a question and all that was expexted was a simple answer."

Switzerland,3beyrf,seitgeist,17,Sun Jun 28 19:45:35 2015 UTC,"Conversely, I went to the US and I couldn't stand how all the service personnel was trying to start up conversations instead of just ringing me up or bringing me my food/drinks. It's nice if you are indeed going for conversations and human contact but it's just not the Swiss way. I am sociable enough, for example I would understand when Americans want to talk to me and I would answer back, but it's not in my habits per se.  It's one of these cultural differences you have to be aware of when meeting other people. For example, I've already had problems with some Swiss people back when I moved back from Paris. And I'm Swiss. People here are just used to very straightforward interactions, few ulterior motives, not getting too intimate or ""agressive"" at first contacts, etc.  My husband went for his Master's project in the US. He was shocked at how easy it was to get friends for an evening or a day, but then next week it was almost like they didn't know him, because it hadn't actually meant much."

He eyeballed me first and I was expecting him to shape up for a fight, then I said ""G'Day Mate"" and he his whole body language shifted and he looked visually surprised and started talking my ear off and asking so many questions I almost missed my train."
Switzerland,3beyrf,Sunken_Drailor,2,Tue Jun 30 10:02:54 2015 UTC,Meeting people and making new friends is a good enough specific reason if you ask me.. But I can see what you're on about.
Switzerland,3beyrf,korky1318,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:35:56 2015 UTC,"But no one just randomly makes friends on the street, in any country. I assume OP is American or English or something, but if you watch any prank video on youtube where they talk to strangers, basically all of them are like ""what do you want?""."
Switzerland,3beyrf,SwissBliss,2,Sun Jun 28 19:56:26 2015 UTC,"YouTube prank videos as an example of random social interactions in the US is really not an accurate representation. Plus, it's not about ""making friends"" necessarily, but just interacting with people. Sometimes people do make friends this way though.  I find here people focus more on formalities in social situations (always saying hello and goodbye on elevators for example). Where in the US we generally start up random informal conversations instead (like ""how about the weather?"")."
Switzerland,3beyrf,goldenvile,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:52:25 2015 UTC,"I've lived in the US, Florida specifically, and I've never noticed any difference between social interaction, at least not huge differences. If I go to a shop in the US, they or I will say ""How are you today?"" and someone will answer, and that's about it. Same thing here. Yesterday I went to a farm in Vaud and I talked for a few minutes about their distributors and when they're open.   All I'm saying is that you can't expect anyone to have a conversation with you if you aren't speaking the local language. I'm not going to go to China and have any deep conversations with strangers, not cause they're antisocial or rude, but it just doesn't make sense."
Switzerland,3beyrf,SwissBliss,2,Mon Jun 29 13:03:41 2015 UTC,"Yes it actually does happen mate. There are prank videos but there are also real situations where for example guys end up getting numbers from girls.. and there's the root to a friendship or more in those situations.. anyway. There's a whole very popular subreddit about this here but I'd rather not get into it too much, it's not very liked amongst most redditors."
Switzerland,3beyrf,korky1318,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:06:37 2015 UTC,"That happens here as well, but of course if you don't speak their language it's kinda hard to get along."

I'm not saying this in a bad way.. it's just a way of socialising that we're not used to here in Switzerland, unfortunately.   I'd love to chat up random people about things, and I do so as often as I can where something interesting or in context of the situation we are in is happening. Ie music festivals about artists and whatever. It works well in specific cases, but as you pointed out, if you're just chatting up random girls you'll get a frown 90% of the time here.

In case you're wondering, I'm not trolling, but technically a registered partnership (as such!) is not possible between different-sex-couples, and marriage is not possible between same-sex-couples.

Switzerland,3bakq9,fripletister,-10,Sat Jun 27 16:16:16 2015 UTC,That's the point so can we say this to gays too? No we can't we must treat them nicely by law. The thing I want to tell is that this whole gay hype the last years is going out of control. Maybe gay marriage is a human right now but what is next? polygamie? gayquote? government funded operations for men pregnancy? Why is it so necessary we must alter an over 2000 year old tradition just because the title is a different one? It just makes no sense. Traditions are meant to celebrate the way it's meant to be celebrated. A tradition is more than only a government law. If it gets this way then the marriage isn't the same like before. That is why the swiss government created the civil union in 2007 so the gays can marry eachother and an old tradition don't have to change. Perfect for everyone.
Switzerland,3bakq9,furbyhater,4,Sat Jun 27 17:41:19 2015 UTC,Laws don't say gay people must be treated nicely by other citizens — they guarantee the >legal rights< of citizens.
Switzerland,3bakq9,fripletister,3,Sat Jun 27 18:12:41 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with you, if gay couples in civil union enjoy EXACTLY all the same rights as married couples (I'm not sure if that's the case already)."
Switzerland,3bakq9,Pascal1511,2,Sat Jun 27 18:32:32 2015 UTC,"It's obviously not the case or there would be no debate. Nor would the terms ""marriage"" and ""civil union"" have distinct meaning."
Switzerland,3bakq9,buyacasha,-1,Sat Jun 27 19:09:59 2015 UTC,Civil Union and marriage are equal there is no difference except a fucking word and history. Yeah lets change history because future.
Switzerland,3bakq9,fripletister,2,Sat Jun 27 20:41:57 2015 UTC,"That's wrong and is the very core of the problem. Actually, I don't give a rats ass if gay people can marry or not, because I do recognize that it is something with a religious context. However, the problem is that marriage has attached legal benefits and rights, and it is not ok to withhold these rights from parts of the population based on sexual orientation."
Switzerland,3bakq9,endeavourl,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:11:36 2015 UTC,"Bingo. You can't have it both ways. We have muddled the definition of marriage by moving it from the church and into the legislature. It's now a question of ethics and constitutionality, not of scripture and feelings."

Switzerland,3bakq9,SwissBliss,-18,Sat Jun 27 18:25:13 2015 UTC,Thats how swiss politics work and thats why it is so successful towards other countries. It's because we let other countries run first and check if the way they are going is safe and when they're running in a wall then we know we should no do this. If they have success we can serious discuss this to make it happen.

Switzerland,3bakq9,picala,-12,Sat Jun 27 23:03:56 2015 UTC,"Not the government nor the people but maybe the marriage, an over 2000 fucking year old tradition. It's like there is a house that is built in the time period of the roman empire and you just want to alter it. Just because some people are whining about how unsuitable this old house is. Great society I must say."
Switzerland,3bakq9,Pascal1511,5,Sat Jun 27 16:25:23 2015 UTC,"You know, over 2000yrs a lot of things change. And sometimes we see that things that were true back then are not true anymore.

Switzerland,3bakq9,Pascal1511,4,Sun Jun 28 05:44:05 2015 UTC,"No, but your argument is that because it is old it should not be changed. Hypocritical. We all decide what the future will be, but if you don't want to see the writing on the wall then so be it."
Switzerland,3bakq9,fripletister,0,Sat Jun 27 18:49:58 2015 UTC,A tradition is something different. It is celebrated because it is old. When it's new its not a tradition.
Switzerland,3bakq9,P1r4nha,3,Sat Jun 27 20:39:22 2015 UTC,"Are you for real? Marriage is no longer just a ""tradition"", it has a legal definition that grants people bound under it rights and benefits. It is not ethical to withhold those rights from two consenting adults just because they happen to not be heterosexual."
Switzerland,3bakq9,P1r4nha,2,Sun Jun 28 00:07:02 2015 UTC,"It is celebrated because it is old.   Which makes as much sense as changing things because they're old.  You're right. Saying that something should be changed because we haven't adapted it for a while is not a good enough reason to change something.  However the argument that something doesn't need change because it's been a thing for a very long time is equally useless.  We have to examine things just a bit more throughly and weigh other arguments as well. Things like the people's happiness. Possible consequences of change vs no change. Economic factors and moral factors. Looking at other countries who did similar things.  Honestly when doing this examination I cannot really see any negative points and the positives are just tipping the scale overwhelmingly towards equality.  So if your only argument is that we should not change it because we haven't changed it for several thousands of years (which is probably not true, minor changes have happened all the time), then you don't have to wonder why you're losing the discourse."
Switzerland,3bakq9,Pascal1511,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:44:57 2015 UTC,"The purpose of a house is that people can live in it. If a house has not been renovated in the past 2000 years it's most likely not possible to live in it anymore. Either it's illegal because of violations of building codes, nobody wants to live in it because it's inconvenient or it is falling apart and it's just dangerous to stay in there."
Switzerland,3bakq9,Vlip,0,Sun Jun 28 02:11:18 2015 UTC,Sure there are people who likes this house because it has history. Now other people who want this house to fit their needs claim this house is have to be changed. They have another house which was solely built for their needs and behaviours to not have to renew the old house but they want to alter it anyway because they're jealous and upset.

If you're going to live in Switzerland, then I suggest you prepare yourself to learning a new language. If you end up in the French-speaking area, as a Spanish speaker you'll probably have an easier time learning French. Likewise with the culture, of course Swiss culture has little to do with Argentine culture, but you'll probably find the French-speaking area easier to integrate to than the German-speaking area, and Geneva has lots of Latinos."

I just assumed it might be, since I figure you are one, although I guess you probably don't have much in common with Mexicans (for example) other than language. I don't know, perhaps you can find a sense of kinship with other Latin Americans, but I don't know you or Argentina so perhaps I'm way off the mark!  It's interesting to me that you found Germany foreboding to the point of being worried about doing something you houldn't. The laws in Germany are probably not very different from Argentina, I'd think you'd have to try to do something wrong, rather than do something wrong inadvertently. You may have gotten that impression from interacting with Germans, in general they aren't as warm or welcoming as Italians, but again, you'd be hard pressed to do something wrong unless you were trying."

As opposed to that, members of the ""Erbengemeinschaft"" are considered owners of their part of the estate immediately after death, regardless of whether they have yet received a pay-out. Compare Art. 602 and following of the Civil Code.

Switzerland,3b730r,cccora,12,Fri Jun 26 14:29:01 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1L3SrcVbaA  There aren't really online resources or apps who really could help you (as far as I know). You have to spend some time with people who speak Swiss German and that's the only way to learn it. It will probably be harder to understand than the German dialects you already know.
Switzerland,3b730r,SatoyS,4,Fri Jun 26 15:36:08 2015 UTC,I love that sketch. Makes me laugh every time.
Switzerland,3b730r,simluk,8,Fri Jun 26 15:48:32 2015 UTC,"Migros Klubschule offers courses in swiss german.  There are books but lets be honest, you're not going to learn a dialect/accent from a book (not efficiently anyway). Even more so because swiss german is tecnically a spoken  language and has no standardisation/ spelling rules.   Talk to people, mingle, have them repeat stuff, ask them to speak slowly. Imersion is the best way to learn a language.  Edit: Focus on understanding, no one here really expects people with other mother tongues to speak swiss german. Also a google search yielded this app, not sure how useful: http://schweizerdeutsch.org/schweizerdeutsch-lernen-mobile-app/"
Switzerland,3b730r,simluk,8,Fri Jun 26 15:39:57 2015 UTC,"Hey there - I'm in a similar boat: pretty decent at Hochdeutsch; need a lot of exposure to Swiss German!   For what it's worth, I hear people say ""Standarddeutsch"" instead of ""Hochdeutsch"" in Switzerland. I don't think there's anything wrong with saying Hochdeutsch, but I've started to prefer referring to it as standard rather than high (I know that it's to differentiate from Plattdeutsch, but there's obviously none of that to be found in Switzerland!)   Now, onto your actual question-- I've found that Züritütsch is one of the easier dialects to understand if you're coming from a Hochdeutsch background - much easier than, say, Bärntütsch. On a good day, I can understand about 70% of Züritütsch. A lot of it is pattern recognition: your brain starts to realize that ""au"" (as in ""auf"") typically gets changed to ""uu"", so eventually you recognize ""uuf"" right away.  Anyway, in terms of resources: This YouTube channel is one of the best I'm aware of. Since I'm not currently living in Switzerland, it's been one nice way to get familiar with those patterns and vocab in general. Bonus: the creator speaks in Züritütsch!  There's also a book called Hoi, but I haven't read it so I can't vouch for how helpful it might be.  Immersion really is best. Especially if you speak English and Hochdeutsch, it can be hard to convince people not to speak to you in one of those languages instead - when I'm in Switzerland, they usually take pity on me and revert to something that I'm more adept at. That's all fine and well, but it doesn't help me learn faster! :) So the more you can mingle and interact and make a fool out of yourself for speaking broken dialect, the faster you'll learn, and the more comfortable you'll feel.   My (Swiss) husband knows a few foreigners who went through the Migros school, and he thinks it was overpriced given the results they got. The best thing is just to talk. Now, if only I could convince him not to just speak in Standarddeutsch and English with me... :)  Edit: fixed some typos"

I'd add Balthazar (lounge with good cocktails) and Cargobar (microbrewery with occasional live music, on the Rhine). There's also Werk8. It's a little out of the way, but it's pretty nice and has (in my opinion) the best cocktails in the city. Also if you're into beers you should check out the Penguin. You'll want to bring a friend because it is mostly empty. The owner is retired and runs it as a hobby. But, seriously, the Rhine is where the party is at until September."

But, if there is anywhere that their guard is down it would be at the Rhine. As a woman you will be excused for breaking etiquette. You can probably introduce yourself under the pretext of having a beer bottle opened or a cigarette lit. If you would like I can simply introduce you to some people I know. We all speak English with each other since we're PhD students. There's even a handful of Americans.   If you don't mind me asking, what's your plan in Basel?

I honestly can't tell you what's so bad or good about it, I've lived in Switzerland for years, and have never been. 4 days is certainly too much for any Swiss town, they're not really made for tourists . I'd suggest you pick a few different cities instead, say Bern, Basel, Zürich and Luzern, spend a days travelling and one day up in the mountains. Maybe Pilatus or something like that."
Switzerland,3b76ri,Rasputin94,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:14:38 2015 UTC,"Interlaken isn't bad per se, just a bit touristy, which isn't only a bad thing. If you want to check out some nightlife, I'd suggest taking the trainride to bern, might be quite scenic as well."

Switzerland,3b4685,K13fbowl,10,Thu Jun 25 20:42:22 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest obstacle for you might be the lack of income in the first year, because life is quite a bit expensive over here. You need about 3000-4000 CHF income per month if you want to live on your own comfortably (depends alot on where you live, don't really know how the prices are around bern) but you could get through with about 2000 or even less per month if you share a flat (rent will be a pretty big part of your expenses). If your internship is fulltime, it might be very hard to earn that much on the side, you would have to work all weekend basically. But generally, with a bit of luck and basic german/french, it might be possible to get a job as a dishwasher which pays about 20 CHF/hr.  Here is a list of rooms in shared flats in and around bern (with prices):  http://www.wgzimmer.ch/en/wgzimmer/search/mate.html? I would recommend finding a shared flat, not only does it cost less, but you will meet a lot of cool people and have an easier time finding friends.   Also it might be a good idea to apply for your  EU/Schengen citizenship, makes a lot of things easier. Even though if you have a job/internship beforehand, you should have no trouble getting into Switzerland (correct me if I'm wrong).  I hope my advice was helpful and not too discouraging. It sounds like an awesome opportunity. I wouldn't give up on it, Switzerland is a great place. But still, there are certain things to consider beforehand, but I think it's entirely possible that you could make it. I wish you the best of luck and success in all of your endeavours!"
Switzerland,3b4685,laughinglynx,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:41:33 2015 UTC,Ahh Thank you so much!!  Yes definitely planning on sharing a flat.  This is very encouraging!  Sounds about the same as Australian living expenses/wages.  Are there any good job boards or sites I should check out that you know of?

Definitely easier for his employer to get the visa for him, yes. However it might be, that there is an exemption for artists, so it doesn't even matter whether he's an EU citizen or not.  As OP I'd talk to the employer about the visa application process and coordinate with him accordingly. The employer should get all necessary information from the migration office in Bern and look at all the different possibilities with OP.  Main problem I see: Lack of any income. OP has to show he can survive in Switzerland."
Switzerland,3b4685,fffmmm,6,Fri Jun 26 06:56:35 2015 UTC,"Get that Croatian citizenship. If there are so many people that want to do a internship and so few places available that they can get away with not paying you, then they would be lying to the authorities when they tell them that they couldn't find anyone in Switzerland or the EU.  (I do have a bad feeling... I get the impression that they are trying to completely rip you off since even in fields that are completely over-saturated [eg: psychology] internships are usually paid as far as I know. If not someone with more experience will hopefully correct me.)"
Switzerland,3b4685,simluk,7,Thu Jun 25 22:10:52 2015 UTC,"For educational programs that require an internship (law, medicin, etc.) the internship has to be a payed one. The cantons even mandate the approximate ammount of the salary. As far as i can tell the others don't seem have to be payed (though according to nzz 95% of internships are). Not a lawyer though.  To OP: If you're ok with the conditions of the internship and it's what you want to do don't let us get you down. laughinglynx pretty much said most of it. If you rely on funds from outside keep the exchange rates in mind, the Franc is stupidly overvalued (and will most likely stay this way) which makes it more expensive. Also if the internship is full time, taking on another job will be hard work and personally i'd think twice on that but that's for you to decide."
Switzerland,3b4685,simluk,3,Thu Jun 25 23:26:24 2015 UTC,"Unpaid internships are standard across the audio industry.  Completely illegal in most countries, happens anyways.  Not sure how they get away with it but they do.  I met the owner at a seminar last night and after a lengthy discussion this opportunity is what came of it."
Switzerland,3b4685,blackkettle,3,Thu Jun 25 23:07:01 2015 UTC,"But yes, Croatian citizenship for sure.  Although someone just mentioned getting a 1 year internship or working visa.  Would that work do you think?"
Switzerland,3b4685,weeeaaa,5,Thu Jun 25 23:08:06 2015 UTC,"If you can get a working visa you don't necessarily need an EU citizenship but as a non EU citizen the whole process is a lot more cpmplicated. Anyone wanting to give you a job (sponser you for a visa) has to prove they can't find someone from Switzerland or within the EU.  HOWEVER i just looked it up and it seems that croatia is not part of the ""schengen"" agreement (which regulates mobility betwen the eu countries, Switzerland and some others), which could mean that a Croatian citizenship might not help much. Again not a lawyer so i could be wrong.  Edit: according to this list it doesn't make much of a difference if canadian or croatian: https://www.bfm.admin.ch/bfm/en/home/publiservice/weisungen-kreisschreiben/visa/liste1_staatsangehoerigkeit.html"

Second, Swiss people are at least as Sheeple-ish as US citizens. You should get your facts straight. We are not a libertarian haven. In fact, we had Obamacare before the rebulicans had the individual mandate idea in their heads.  Third, when you have both your passport and straight facts, you'll need to find a job. When you have one, you'll almost automatically get admitted to Switzerland.   So ask yourself: Do you speak the languages?

But without an employment contract, why should anyone give you an apartment, if you can't guarantee that you'll be able to continuously pay the rent?  Regarding the language: You'll need it. There are fields where speaking German or French is not important, mainly IT. I have no idea about air traffic control, though, so do inquire the companies and agencies.   So yes, this is more complicated thant you think. You can get by with only speaking English, since most young people have a very good command of it, but you might have deep troubles finding a job.   Once you have both a EU passport and a job, you'll get the residence permit pretty automatically, though. You can come here for three months on a EU passport to look for a job, but I wouldn't do that if I were you, since this will by no means guarantee you one."
Switzerland,3b2hv5,YeaISeddit,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:30:01 2015 UTC,What about having my own business? We have a side business on ebay / amazon reselling items we buy locally at like thrift stores yard sales and the like. I'm sure we would have to change the business model slightly but it could probably work locally there as well.   I've emailed the swiss air traffic organization already and english is the international aviation language so I should be hireable immediately by them.   My wife and I have a very broad skillset and probably could quit our current jobs and live comfortably off side jobs and gigs. I feel like we could adapt and find work anywhere we go because of this.
Switzerland,3b2hv5,P1r4nha,23,Thu Jun 25 13:35:34 2015 UTC,"In my experience, the people who move abroad because they are disgruntled are less likely to assimilate into the local culture and more likely to repatriate. I've seen it with lots of Brits and Americans. America has some of the highest living standards and is one of the most free countries in the world. If you think life in the USA is oppressive then wait until you meet your first Swiss landlord. You are absolutely going to find things you don't like about Switzerland and you will have to learn to live with them.  I think you need to change your attitude if you are actually going to make the jump. You should be excited to move abroad to experience something new, not escape something. The problems you are trying to escape will almost definitely follow you."

It's just my impression from stories, news reports from official sources and friends of mine."

Over the course of the following months we devolved into a state of anarchy. This was, of course, an impossible rule that couldn't be followed. We didn't ask, we didn't apologize, we simply took what was ours. The Hauswarden did his best, like a dictator who's being propped up by external agents (landlord). He posted signs demanding we follow the rule. He came door to door and pleaded with us to follow the rule. But, we refused. Eventually I caved and bought a machine, but the rest of my building is still mired in laundry revolution."

Switzerland,3b2hv5,simluk,2,Thu Jun 25 14:05:38 2015 UTC,"Well, that's great. I personally find Swiss politics no less frustrating than American politics, but I've never let either get to me. Get that EU passport and you'll be good to go. While you wait to get through all the red tape to get the passport I strongly recommend you get your German or French to B1. If you are motivated you can do it in 6 months. If you do this, make sure you get a certificate. It will help you find a job."
Switzerland,3b2hv5,as-well,3,Thu Jun 25 14:16:22 2015 UTC,That reselling business certainly won't work here. The market is a fraction of the size than in the US.
Switzerland,3b2hv5,as-well,2,Thu Jun 25 18:37:37 2015 UTC,The problem with side jobs and gigs is that it needs a work permit and as far as i know employer backing is usually crucial to getting one. Noone's going to help you apply for one for a side job (and if they do there is no guarantee it'll be granted). Same goes for your own buissnes.   Also what kind of sidejobs and gigs do you expect to find if you can't even communicate with the locals natively? On top of that Switzerland is expensive. I highly doubt you'd be able to live comfortably on side jobs and gigs.  The only save way to go about this is to find stable employment or bust.
Switzerland,3b2hv5,whitepalms85,4,Thu Jun 25 14:38:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, maybe a side business would work, maybe it wouldn't. Are you ready to invest a considerable amount of time and cash into it while moving to a new country where you have nearly no knowledge?  Yes, English is the international language, but maybe their internal working is in German. They wouldn't hire you if you can communicate with pilots, but not in team meetings.  A good skillset is nice, but you have to understand that Swiss workers are very well formally educated. If you were an employer, you'd probably take the local dude with a degree in the job field over the foreigner who says he has the skills (and good references), but no guarantee that he will thrive in them."
Switzerland,3b2hv5,ghstw,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:39:38 2015 UTC,"By the skillset part I mean in manufacturing or low-level office jobs. In high-level jobs it, of course, comes down to experience, not degrees."

Yeah, it's a bit of a disadvantage if you can't speak German/French but if you are specialized enough, it should be too bad. Idk, this guy is giving you a very pessimistic picture.  Also with EU citizenship you can actually come here and search for a job. I think you can stay for three month or so but in reality it's much longer. E.g. you could be here as a tourist, sign temporary rental contracts and so on. It's not like it's illegal to be here as a EU citizen so it's difficult to enforce the rule."
Switzerland,3b2hv5,lhatchy1,3,Thu Jun 25 22:19:35 2015 UTC,The aviation/aerospace industry in Switzerland is almost nonexistent. The only jobs I could see you working at with a bachelor of air traffic management would be at Skyguide or an airport. ATC in Switzerland is privatized and operated by Skyguide. At some airports Apron is operated by the actual airport.   Knowing German is highly recommend to have a nice work environment with your colleagues  since 99 % of the people working there are Swiss. You would only be talking to the aircrafts in English. If I remember correctly you also have to be a swiss citizen to be able to work as a controller and also not sure if you would have to do the 2-year apprenticeship as a new joiner.  You should rather leverage your consulting experience and attempt to get a job as a consultant at one of the Big4s or boutique consulting firm. Most likely you would end in the financial service industry or pharmaceutical industry.

Switzerland,3ayo7d,SatoyS,7,Wed Jun 24 18:24:55 2015 UTC,It's sad that you are down voted because people disagree. You make a good point: one legal health hazard does not justify legalizing another.

Switzerland,3ayo7d,SatoyS,5,Wed Jun 24 23:27:04 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I don't see ""just deal with it"" being a very critical value. It's intentionally antagonistic and adds nothing to the debate."
Switzerland,3ayo7d,YeaISeddit,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:45:52 2015 UTC,"The ""deal with it"" is for the alcohol is legal part and not for the weed is illegal. You can't change that one is legal because of history, but you can't really use it as an argument for your purpose!"
Switzerland,3ayo7d,SatoyS,2,Thu Jun 25 11:03:52 2015 UTC,"Well, I read ""deal with it"" as being the answer to the question ""Is it fair?"" I think that's how most people read it.   You are right that marijuana is factually illegal and alcohol factually legal. No one here is debating that, so restating it comes off as condescending. Furthermore, ""Dealing with it"" is not a critical thought. Critical thinking would, in this case, involve the logical rationalization of rules. If your rationale is that, things are because they are. This form of self-evident argumentation is as old as history. It's called begging the question and it is a logical fallacy."
Switzerland,3ayo7d,hikari-boulders,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:23:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not someone who smokes (neither cigarettes nor anything else) but I'm still in favour of legalizing pot. As far as I know (correct me if I'm wrong):    There are A LOT of drug dealers in Switzerland. The ones I see daily (I'm based in Lausanne) apparently sell often more then just pot.  These ""other drugs"" can have very bad effects on the people who use them. Apparently, although they suffer from the competition of locally produced hemp, there is a whole mafia in the true sense of the term around the import and distribution of hemp and the other drugs. The US experience shows that a lot of these negative side effects could be reduced by legalizing (but still regulating) pot production and distribution.    And regarding alcohol: Given the negative effect it has on people's health and society (there is really a strong correlation between alcohol consumption and violence), I'm in favor of a stricter regulation and taxes (which - I know - is very unpopular in Switzerland where they even want to subsidize strong alcohols that are produced locally).   So I compare the two not because I want to smoke pot, but because it simply shows how ""unreasonable"" the current legislation is."
Switzerland,3ayo7d,LeSpatula,2,Thu Jun 25 06:00:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe I did a bad job in writing it down, that I am not against the legalization. Nothing to add to the first half of your comment.  Yes, alcohol has a bad influence on many people and after tobacco it will be the next topic for politician to get famous for solving ""big problems"". How to solve these problems would be a complete other discussion.  It seems illogical that alcohol is allowed and pot isn't, but as I said, it's only because of the history and alcohol would not have a chance to become legal today. If you argue for something, bring up reasons for your thing and don't say others are allowed --> that is what children do which was my point in the first place."

Switzerland,3az9a6,shrekislove123,3,Wed Jun 24 18:17:17 2015 UTC,"Hi, No special recommendation about tourism stuffs. Salève is nice for the view I guess but I haven't been there for more than a decade. Weather should be nice tomorrow so it should be the perfect day.  About the SIM card look for Lycamobile, you should get it anywhere but not sure you can activate it on the same day, you should ask. The sim is free and you can buy 1Gb of 4G data for 5.90CHF valid 30days, however you will probably need to charge 10 or 20CHF in the first place, you have to check.  About public transports there is nothing as far as I know because when you go to an hotel you have a free public transport card for your whole trip, of course you don't get it with Airbnb. You should just get a day pass for city center in the morning of each day, it is quite cheap. However it will not be valid for your trip to Salève because it's outside the city center.  You can PM me if you have specific question, I'll try to help.  Edit: it was implied to me, but of course you should go for a walk around the lake, cross one of the pedestrian bridge and go to the little park in the corner between the lake and the Mont Blanc bridge (large one with cars). If you like shopping there are the Five street and Mont Blanc street, there are parallels (second one is for luxury brands, the closest to the lake side)"

It's the type of city that you just walk through and enjoy the atmosphere and history of it. If you're willing to travel around the lake then I could recommend some stuff. If I have to name some famous places in Geneva, I'd say CERN, the United Nations/Palace of Nations, the ICRC, the 3 legged chair monument, the train station, but most of all just walk around the lake and see the Jet D'eau with all the nice hotels like the President Wilson or all the banks and watch companies.   Think of the city as the Capital of Peace of the World, and enjoy the significance of it"
Switzerland,3az9a6,SwissBliss,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:50:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm sort of getting that vibe here. Thanks! Will definitely check out the CERN. Also can you recommend some traditional Swiss food to try out while I'm here? Sandwich/pancakes/deserts/maincourse anything really
Switzerland,3az9a6,SwissBliss,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:56:57 2015 UTC,"Geneva is super international so it's hard to really get that traditional swiss food. The obvious ones are fondue, raclette, chocolate, wine, rösti, etc... If you like burgers go to Holy Cow near the train station.

Switzerland,3az9a6,SwissBliss,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:06:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say the most touristy areas are near the Jet D'eau so near the big Mont Blanc bridge with all the flags (that's where all the hotels, companies, stores are). Also go near the Apple store in Geneva, there are a bunch of nice places to drink and eat and shop or just hang around (the Apple store, the bridge, and the train station are all easy walking distance from each other). Finally I'd say around the United Nations and the Chair Monument is where most people will be taking pictures.   My favorite is definitely just walking next to the lake at dusk with the Jet D'eau nearby and the atmosphere of Geneva around. It's the Quai du Mont Blanc road specifically where lots of people hang out and walk by the lake.   Also I just remembered something. If you've been around reddit a lot then you've probably seen this: http://i.imgur.com/UlWG3.jpg If you wanna see it just do a quick google search and go to the bridge nearby  Edit: I forgot to answer the language thing. Normally almost everyone speaks english at least decently. Of course you might meet a few old locals that don't really need to learn english, but the rest are either tourists, or live in the most international city there is, so English is almost mandatory."

But to be fair, Swiss spends a lot of money on branding and there are a lot of people that are willing to pay for it, it's more prestige to fly Swiss than easyjet (and it's true that Swiss has a better crowed) even though the difference seems to have become pretty marginal.    I have been using Easyjet since Swiss(air) left Geneva for the Unique Airport/Hub (c)(r)(tm) and enjoyed every flight with a 3€ sandwich and a 4€ beer on top of my 45€ flight.   Yeah but the thing with e.g. easyjet Zurich London is that you end up in airports that are quite far outside. So on top of the flight price you need to at the extra costs for transport and the time you lose. So it really depends on your location. From West London easyjet is quite unattractive but if you live North or South it's actually faster than Heathrow."

Switzerland,3b07il,leo_037,25,Thu Jun 25 08:15:31 2015 UTC,Why on earth would you want to open carry in Switzerland?  It is most certainly not the norm.
Switzerland,3b07il,variousbiscuits,23,Thu Jun 25 00:37:18 2015 UTC,"Hey there!  In order to take your guns to Switzerland you would need to contact a gun shop and ask them to handle the paperwork for you, by paying a fee of course. This is the easiest way to do it, since there is no import restrictions when it comes to guns but in your case you do have certain restricted items.  Either way, it would work like acquiring a gun in Switzerland normally (for the normal items).   Another problem that I'm seeing, is that if you are moving to Switzerland and you don't get the permanent residential permit, it will be quite hard for you to own guns and take them with you. I would wait at least 5 years until you get the C permit.  Your special items are the only problem that I'm seeing.   20x138   Is this a Lahti that you own? I've never seen these guns for sale in Switzerland, although .50BMG is widely available and you can get guns that shoot that caliber very easily, it would all be a matter of asking the authorities if that rifle is allowed. I would assume that it is allowed, but I really never seen rifles in those calibers for sale.   pre-1986 automatics   Another problem. Although it would have been fairly easy to buy these guns in Switzerland if you already lived here, it will be a hassle to take them with you.  Automatic weapons are only allowed with a special permit and they usually only give you this permit if you are fairly known to the police as a gun collector or if you already have owned guns in Switzerland for several years without any problems.  Do you own semi auto converted rifles that used to be FA? Those are considered to be FA by the police unless you can show a document from the factory that made the gun saying that it is semi auto.   suppressors   Suppressors are restricted in Switzerland but are easier to get than FA guns. Could be possible to take them with you by asking the gun shop to fill out the paperwork for you.   SBR   There are no SBR/SBS laws in Switzerland. These would just be considered normal rifles according to the Swiss law. So I don't see any problems there.   Also, is that true they don't give concealed carry permit to retired old guys like myself (only given for security jobs I've heard)?   Getting a CC permit is almost impossible without a really good reason. You can pass the test in order to apply to the CC permit, but only 5 out of 100 people that pass the test actually get the license to carry a gun. It all depends on your job.   But most of all, could you confirm that at least open carry is the norm (here too, heard of people on bikes with Sig550s on the sling, but no official word on it)?   I don't like to call it ""open carry"". I like to call it open transportation of guns.   I also do openly transport my guns when I go to the range, but that's about it. You cannot take detours with those guns and you cannot carry them loaded or ammo inside the magazines. It is although possible to carry ammo in clips inside your pocket, but there's really no reason to do it since I've been in Switzerland for 28 years and I've never once saw any situation where I could have used a gun.  The thing about your issue is that you will need to apply for a permit for some of your guns (semi-auto, handguns, pump-action guns and lever action guns). The gun shop will help you, and if you have no criminal records you will be able to easily get the permit since it's ""shall issue"". All it takes is a clean background check, psychological problems are not really checked since they cannot ask your doctor about your problems, but they might check any records of you having been in a mental asylum or something similar.  Another thing that I failed to mention:  If you expect Switzerland to have the same mentality towards guns as the USA, you will see that it's not really the case. Even our sports shooting events are based in high standards of accuracy, you will not find someone that will go to a gun club and shoot blast shit with his SIG 550. Our official ranges are highly regulated and very professional, you might find a suitable range to ""blast shit up"" with your guns but those are rare and are spread throughout Switzerland.  You can certainly keep a gun for home defense if you want, but the liability will be on you if something happens with the gun."
Switzerland,3b07il,Zorthianator,5,Thu Jun 25 05:35:29 2015 UTC,"I don't like to call it ""open carry"". I like to call it open transportation of guns. I also do openly transport my guns when I go to the range, but that's about it.   Just want to emphasize this. The law is that you are allowed to transport your gun from your home to the shooting range safely. You are not allowed to have a gun on you otherwise (not from-to the shooting range). The pictures you saw with a 21 year old on his bike with an assault rifle on his back is exactly this. He is a soldier driving from home to the shooting rage with the weapon he was lent by the army for his yearly mandatory precision shooting exercise. He does not carry ammunition, only an empty gun. Ammo is provided by the range for immediate local consumption.  The only people you see here carrying guns are police the the army. The army either exercising in the countryside or guarding an event, like the world economic forum or embassies an building during high profile international negotiations, like Kerry talking to Iran.  Wikipedia has an overview: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Switzerland#Transporting_guns  If carrying a gun is important to you, then you are much better off in the US in a state where this is allowed and part of the local lifestyle. This is not the case in Switzerland."
Switzerland,3b07il,markus_b,32,Fri Jun 26 08:23:09 2015 UTC,"Why would you carry your weapon around? Unless you are taking it to the shooting range for sure!

It sure doesn't make a country safer overall when you always have to expect the other one having a gun with him.  I don't know how the laws are, actually it doesn't matter: It is very unusual to see people with guns in public except for military related reasons, therefore I strongly advice you to adapt and leave your weapon at home!"

Switzerland,3b07il,tango-01,-1,Thu Jun 25 09:34:52 2015 UTC,"This is a common thing I hear from people from other countries than the US.  I know it is difficult to understand if one is from elsewhere, but in the US, it is part of the culture.  Our love for guns is often mistaken for the same love of guns that one from a place like Switzerland would have.    If in the US you love guns, you're just an American, and that behavior is part of the norm.  Because we grow up around guns in fairly large numbers from a high percentage of the population, there is nothing unusual about liking guns or owning them.  But for a place like Switzerland, where guns are not a major part of the culture, the type of person who would go against the ingrained culture and love guns is probably a nut.  Also, a large part of US culture is that we are a country founded because of a hate for powerful government.  As such, we tend to have a very strong reaction to the notion of having any particular liberty taken from us.  In recent decades, our federal government has become increasingly powerful and indifferent to the Constitution, which is essentially a sacred document here.  In response, certain citizens like to exercise some of those rights just because they can.  Also, in the US, especially on the eastern half, there is a clear delineation between northern and southern culture.  Those in the north are called Yankees, and are largely not the type to be a part of gun culture.  Those in the south are called Southerners and are the ones who are most likely to partake in gun culture.  So, although I'm aware that those outside the US tend to call all of us ""yanks"", we specifically only refer to northerners as Yankees."
Switzerland,3b07il,Cat_DDD_Dog,0,Tue Jul 21 15:06:16 2015 UTC,I think the simple answer is...  Just because.
Switzerland,3b07il,Cat_DDD_Dog,13,Tue Jul 21 14:51:26 2015 UTC,"I think something that might be important to understand about most continental European legal systems: They are not as absolute as you might think and something I would call ""common use"" (German ""Usus"") is often very important besides the actual text. That's why people here have negative reactions about your open carry question - even though it can be legal for you to do it, it's very unusual in Switzerland and will make people very vary of you, possibly afraid. When it comes to guns in cities / suburbs, people are only used to seeing them on guys in military service age, and only the SIG 550s by now. In Switzerland people think of ""integration"" as a very important thing, so immigrants are expected to follow commonly used practices to a certain extent, in addition to the law of course. Sorry that Switzerland isn't the libertarian paradise some people seem to think - it is in certain other ways though, especially in terms of civil rights for citizens when it comes to governance."
Switzerland,3b07il,DeepDuh,11,Thu Jun 25 01:38:54 2015 UTC,American here: I think this is a troll account.  Someone who had this many restricted weapons (automatics and short barrelled rifles require additional permits ND background checks.  Autos are absurdly expensive) would have done even basic research online about Swiss gun laws.  Someone who has these weapons is sneaky clean and knows the laws.  Let's not get too excited
Switzerland,3b07il,blarg15,5,Thu Jun 25 20:44:06 2015 UTC,"It's a throw away account as well, should have guessed. Fucking troll."
Switzerland,3b07il,hopsafoobar,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:59:06 2015 UTC,well it looks like everyone is falling for it
Switzerland,3b07il,blarg15,19,Fri Jun 26 22:43:40 2015 UTC,"Getting a permit should be easy as long as you have a clean criminal record.  Open carry is definitely NOT the norm here. People riding bikes with the stgw is not a common sight and you only really see it during the Feldschiessen or the mandatory shooting days.  You need to have a real reason to be carrying a gun (as a member of the army), i.e. going to the army, coming home from the army, having your gun inspected and with a order for the annual mandatory shooting. You should always have a document that states why you are carrying your gun around with you.  Only then do you see guns and also then you should have the lock and magazine removed, but this isn't enforced.  As a normal citizen you need to apply for a special permit and submit a legit reason why you explicitly need to carry a gun around."
Switzerland,3b07il,seitgeist,9,Wed Jun 24 23:01:39 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, acquiring a permit to use a weapon on a shooting range should not be too hard to get. But having a permit to carry a weapon on you at all times requires you to justify such a thing, from what I remember."
Switzerland,3b07il,C4p5ul3,8,Wed Jun 24 22:45:50 2015 UTC,He won't get the permit to CC a gun unless he ends up working in security or something similar.
Switzerland,3b07il,Zorthianator,3,Thu Jun 25 05:41:12 2015 UTC,That's right. The justification is usually that he needs it for his job. Even then you're probably only allowed to do it while you're on the job.

Switzerland,3b07il,DeepBlueNemesis,6,Thu Jun 25 09:40:39 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I merely put the law into a simplified version.  I didn't mention how to get illegal guns or stuff like that. The problem is that Ms. Galladé has a problem with anything related to guns and dangerous things and just decided to overreact when she saw my infographic.  If I had put illegal information in that infograph it would have been completely different."
Switzerland,3b07il,Zorthianator,4,Thu Jun 25 09:42:10 2015 UTC,"Sure, it's a shoot-the-messenger reaction. Oh well, can't please everyone."
Switzerland,3b07il,DeepBlueNemesis,4,Thu Jun 25 09:44:49 2015 UTC,"I don't see the criticism as that problematic unless she said something else than what was written in the article. Of course you created the infographic because you're interested in weapons and thus know quite a lot about it.  As for consequences of the infographic I don't think you hold any responsibility. It's informative, what you do with that information is your own thing. You might be crazy and get a gun and run amok or you get sensitized to the current state of the law, find it too lax and want to make it more restrictive.   It's stupid to find informative content problematic if you actually have a problem with the current laws.  EDIT: typo"
Switzerland,3b07il,P1r4nha,3,Thu Jun 25 10:39:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's the funniest part of it. The law is made for the people, and any infographic that makes it easier to understand and apply is a good thing. If that action creates a problem, then one must discuss changing said law."
Switzerland,3b07il,buyacasha,3,Thu Jun 25 12:04:50 2015 UTC,"I find that the law should be at least be looked upon since several things make no sense at all.   Private sales should be more regulated, since I find it absurd that you can sell a gun without any background check and that you have one month to send the contract to the police, in the mean time if something was done with the rifle it would still be attached to the name of the previous owner! WES should exist alongside with some sort of gun collectors WES that allows you to buy all the guns you want for one year. It's a hassle when you cannot use the same WES to buy several weapons at different gun stores even if you applied for more than one gun. Lever actions and pump actions should be put into the same category as ""Free Weapons"", since it makes no sense to restrict these rifles and put them at the same level as a semi auto gun. Suppressors should be easier to get, it doesn't work like in the movies and since many people complain about the noise from gun ranges it would be better for the population."
Switzerland,3b07il,Zorthianator,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:39:50 2015 UTC,"And that's probably a more sensible suggestion for changes than the SP lady could ever come up with. Not because she's on the left side of the political spectrum, but because she seems to be less informed than you are."
Switzerland,3b07il,P1r4nha,12,Thu Jun 25 13:05:21 2015 UTC,"Please don't carry a gun... you really don't have to in Switzerland (I doubt you have to do so in the US either). As previously mentioned, you will need a valid reason to be able to carry your gun, getting your collection here shouldn't be too difficult as long as you register everything and discuss it with the authorities (maybe try to call the embassy?). Join a shooting club, otherwise you won't have many opportunities to shoot your gun, except if you own a huge piece of land in the middle of fucking nowhere. Also, are suppressors even legal in Switzerland for private use?"
Switzerland,3b07il,Chrisixx,4,Wed Jun 24 23:27:50 2015 UTC,As far as I know suppressors are not legal. There is no legitimate reason for owning one.
Switzerland,3b07il,ughthat,5,Thu Jun 25 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"Suppressors are legal but restricted.  There is a reason to own one. Being able to shoot without ear protection, since suppressors don't work like in the movies, it just makes the sound a bit quiet enough for you to be able to shoot guns without fucking up your hearing."

Switzerland,3b07il,ughthat,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:28:40 2015 UTC,You need special permit from your local government if you wanna buy suppressors.
Switzerland,3b07il,mrfudface,6,Mon Jun 29 11:07:40 2015 UTC,"No, open carry is not a thing. Nobody will bat an eye if you carry your gun to or from the shooting range, but that's about it. No concealed carry unless you can prove you're in special danger. Finally, why would you want to import your old automatics? Sell them in the US and get new ones here for 1/10th the price. You won't be able to shoot them anywhere anyway."
Switzerland,3b07il,hopsafoobar,2,Thu Jun 25 11:24:43 2015 UTC,"That's actually a good idea. He should sell them and then buy new ones in Switzerland.  Shooting them is a bit harder though, that's why I will never own any FA guns. Waste of money, time and paperworks."
Switzerland,3b07il,Zorthianator,12,Thu Jun 25 12:03:19 2015 UTC,"Possession of all automatic firearms and certain kinds of semiautomatic firearms are illegal in Switzerland. Suppressors are also illegal as far as I know.  You need to have a legitimate reason to own a gun to be issued a license. Collecting is considered a valid reason, though I imagine the definition of what qualifies as collectible will be fairly strict.   To get a license you must pass a full background test, which includes mental health as well as criminal, and domestic violence. Your license will also be revoked at any time if your ""qualifications"" change. You also have to re-apply and re-qualify every 5 years as far as I know.   Open carry is technically allowed if you have a valid license. But outside of army or law enforcement personnel this is not done. At least I have not seen any private person openly carrying a gun in public (outside of hunters. Ever. If you choose to open carry for idealistic reasons (I.e in public spaces in civilian clothes) I would prepare to be stopped and questioned by police frequently.   Concealed carry is only allowed by explicit permit, which is only issued if you can proof a genuine need and tangible danger. You must submit mental health reports, pass criminal background checks and pass a police exam in firearm law and gunsafety.  Your best bet to get the info you need about permits is to contact the Kantonspolizei (Cantonal Police) of the canton you are moving to. I think more specifically you want the Sicherheizpolizei (security police) section within the Kantonpolizei. For questions about import regulation I would contact the Swiss Customs Administration.   TL;DR Switzerland is no gun utopia. Laws are fairly restrictive and locals can tend to get a bit twitchy about foreigners owning guns."

The open-carry guys in the USA have political motives usually. There's this idea that the right to bear arms somehow gives the people the opportunity to uprise if the government no longer represents the people. But, the people who support the right to bear arms usually also support the US government spending like half the budget on the military. So, most of them haven't thought things through totally and it is mostly an expression of their discontent with the government/world/life. I know that is a ridiculous overgeneralization.

Yeah we do have a lot of riffles, but what the hell do you expect, we are one of the last countries to have mandatory military service and a military without rifles is kind of pointless. However, we don't have a strong gun culture, we have a rifle because we are obliged to have one, but a lot of people would give it away if they could, because it's just something we have to take care of and once a year we need to remember a date where we go and shoot 30 or 40 rounds. I'd also say Switzerland is so safe (especially compared to the US) because it's even a rare occasion, that any police officer needs to draw his gun. Therefore, the only thing you achieve with having one on you is confirming some redneck stereotypes people might have and making me feel a lot unsafer. Finally, like mentioned before 99% of the people you see with guns will be military(probably in private for the mandatory yearly event) and police, but if you look you'll also see that most of those (wheter in uniform or not) military guys don't even have the magazine( the thing with the bullets in it) or the ""verschluss"" (the thing you use to put a bullet in the chamber) on the rifle"

However, we don't have a strong gun culture,   What the hell are you talking about? Have you perhaps noticed that in almost every village you can find a Schützenverein and that we have the biggest shooting event in the world called Feldschiessen?

Switzerland,3b07il,as-well,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:12:52 2015 UTC,"If you're talking fully automatic, that will very much depend on your Canton of residence. Same for suppressors -- both of those are illegal by default and require a permit issued by the Canton of residence.  Owning the guns won't be a problem as long as you have the right residence permit. Legally importing them involves a bit of paperwork; there have been other threads in this sub as to what exactly you need to do.  You won't get a CCP unless you can demonstrate a need to have one, and from what you write, you can't. Open or concealed carry is legal on reasonable business (i.e. going to the range, the gunsmith, a gun show etc.), but the gun must not have any ammunition in the magazine, so carrying a loaded gun in public is a no-no. You can't just carry a firearm around in public for no good reason."

I honestly never saw someone walking around with a handgun under his jacket. Chances that you're getting robbed is probably under 1%, and if, no one is willing to kill you, events like these are extremly rare.   Of course, there are plenty of things you could carry on your belt that would be far more likely to save lives in situations. An injection of Adrenaline would treat anaphylactic shock (the potentially lethal allergic reaction to certain foods). Or you could carry a small sharp tube to give emergency tracheotomies to people who are chocking to death.   TL;DR: Statistically speaking, you and (maybe) your wife or someone else are far more likely to shoot each other than to shoot a criminal.   EDIT: Even if you would get a license (wich I don't think) for concealed carry, people would allways call the cops or some security guard. Even if you out for shopping. It's just not a thing in Switzerland, to wear your gun(s) around. I wouldn't be suprised if you would get police on your butt on a daily bases."

I have never seen any Döner in Basel or Switzerland that could even be a slight bit comparable to anything you get in Berlin.

Worked in private education for a while (Sales in a business orientated language school, in-company language training for adults) – and I can tell you the market in Geneva is pretty shit. Sure, you can get hours and great pay with companies like Inlingua, Migros etc (your way into these will be the EUROLTA degree), but on the other hand you can also be working for shittier companies that pay a fraction and send you around from company to company at own cost. Re translating, I heard the market is flooded – too many ppl, too little actual need so they take the most qualified only.  TL;DR: Yes, career opportunities are there, but they probably aren't as glamorous as you think. Bring experience and a EUROLTA degree (in addition to your studies)."

Honestly, i have no idea what your chances for a good job might be. Embassies often have positions for translators as well, so maybe also look at that?  As for teachers, the pay is not bad. Depending on the level i'd say even quite good. In public schools that is. However they might not accept a foreign degree. Outside of public school it varies depending on what school you'd teach at.

Also check out farmer/balisto, if you take the options without chocolate/milk cream it's not that bad. There are also a lot of options when it comes to nuts: Studentenfutter, wasabi coated nuts and so on If you want to go for protein: yoghurt, and there's also some beef jerky stuff in most stores.

Switzerland,3aom5g,liquify,8,Mon Jun 22 06:01:03 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you understood that right. You do get an IPv4 address! Just not a static one, just like you do with cablecom etc. So there won't be any problems there.  As for IPv6, they're using prefix delegation which not all routers support. The one they're shipping (Microtic) does, but that one doesn't manage a full Gbit/s with NAT enabled and can only get up to ~600mbps.  So I recommend you the Ubiquiti Edge Router and buy a separate converter as this one doesn't support fiber optics directly. However, there is no option to setup DHCPv6-PD via the GUI, but it can be done via the command line. And you need to configure everything yourself. So if you're not comfortable with that, go with the Microtic.  Not sure if that was too technical or even answers your question. But again, it's not IPv6 only. It's dual stack with a dynamic IPv4 address. You pay if you want a static IPv4.  Source: I have fiber7."
Switzerland,3aom5g,lawl0r,2,Mon Jun 22 11:23:03 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Not too technical at all, it's just that my knowledge of IPv6 is somewhat limited at the moment, but I ought to change that. I definitely misunderstood that then, a dynamic IPv4 address is absolutely fine for us. Does it change often though? Our Cablecom address is technically dynamic, but we haven't got a new one for several months or even years.  We actually didn't plan to buy a router from them, just an SFP to RJ45 (1000BASE-T) converter. We're running PFsense (FreeBSD based) on a PC Engines APU (http://www.pcengines.ch/apu.htm) as router. I think PFSense has no issue with prefix delegation, but I definitely have to look into that.  Thank you very much!"
Switzerland,3aom5g,lawl0r,3,Mon Jun 22 11:39:39 2015 UTC,"You get your IPv4 via DHCP with a lease time of around 10 minutes I think. So as long as you don't power your router off you generally keep your IP (that's of course not a promise, but just what I noticed).  Ahh, I was running ALIX before but the APU wasn't really battle tested yet, so I went with Ubiquiti :) (ALIX has 100mbit ports :( )"
Switzerland,3aom5g,P1r4nha,2,Mon Jun 22 11:48:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah we had ALIX beforehand (running monowall, which sadly is discontinued) but we're just as happy with the APU."

I think what's important is, if you want to have a fixed IP address or you're fine with a dynamic IP like what you usually get with Cablecom and the others.  In the contract I didn't make any cross in any of the options... so I honestly don't know exactly what I have :D."
Switzerland,3aom5g,P1r4nha,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:04:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your answer! According to their website you get a /48 net of (dynamic) IPv6 addresses. A single IPv4 (which is still more commonly used than v6) costs an additional CHF240 per year. v6 support can be somewhat lacking, so I'm glad to hear that you haven't had any problems with it.  Even with a v4 address it would be ~CHF85 per month and that's about what we pay for Cablecom now (without actually using the phone and TV). But seems like it is worth to try v6 only."

I would rather say that the country is successful despite direct democracy. If there ever were a massive crisis in Switzerland our system would collapse VERY fast. A lot of the success of Switzerland was based on the fact that mainly the FDP was in charge and political parties weren't abusing the system. Now Volksinitiativen are purely used for populism, actually they never really served a purpose anyway and we should ban them. I don't mind if people vote on laws that went at least through parliament or on local stuff that is simple to understand and doesn't have a big impact (e.g. building a new football stadium or so). But Volksinitiativen are just pure trash, they create nothing but instability and the quality is terrible.   I think I agree that the people's vote is taken a bit too sacred. The majority can be wrong, yet ""Volkswille"" is shouted at anybody who is a sore loser after a vote. But that's more the narrative of the public discussion, rather than actual actions being taken.   I totally agree. One of the strengths of Switzerland is/was actually political stability and moderation. E.g. I think it's very good that we have a federal council (instead of a powerful president), that all bigger parties are represented and that the council members don't have to campaign for their seats. In other countries you have majority government / collisions and campaigns and politicians waste a ton of time and money on it. And if the opposition wins then they will waste even more time on reverting thing the previous government implemented. Honestly, I actually think the people on the federal council should be banned from being members or associated with any party. I want to have a council full of very smart and very well educated people, the best of the best, not stupid politicians and I wouldn't mind to pay each of them a multimillion salary, just to get them. That money easily pays off."

No, the more centrist the better. SP/Greens/SVP add little value. I would prefer it if we would move to a system where people in the National Council would get elected by the same concept as the Council of States (first-past-the-post system / winner takes it all). This would reduce the number of far left/right wingers in the parliament. It would also reduce the influence of parties and get rid of this nonsense that you can vote for ""lists"" that represent parties. Party politics is pretty useless anyway. I think an ideal system would be where people vote more smartvote style (the online platform) to put the focus more on topics/issues and away from politicians.  I also think that the federal council should consist of non-politicians only and all council members should be well paid top specialists/experts (e.g. former managers, professors...) instead  of amateurish politicians.

The whole point of democracy is that you are allowed to partake. You are even contradicting yourself. So if the Swiss can vote less than it's undemocratic but if the foreigners can't then it's okay? lol, go read some history and political science books. The whole point of democracy was that everyone had the right to vote and not just privileged people. There is no other reason than anti-democratic thinking and xenophobia to discriminate foreigners (and again, we are not talking about tourists, short term residence or criminals, but normal people that pay taxes). Why would you have to pay taxes and not be allowed to have a say?   if they want to vote, they can become a citizen.   No, they can't. The Swiss are intentionally making it absurdly difficult to get a citizenship. You even have to wait more than a decade.

Switzerland,3ajm3z,timmyfinnegan,2,Sat Jun 20 22:38:28 2015 UTC,100mbit but at 99CHF   That's 30 bucks more than cablecom (125 for CHF 69) though..?
Switzerland,3ajm3z,hubraum,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:06:29 2015 UTC,"Did you add the cable cost to the cablecom price? The cable cost was about 30CHF here, and when I stopped using cablecom I didn't have to pay the cable cost any more..."

Switzerland,3ajm3z,Iylivarae,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:20:48 2015 UTC,"25CHF/mon for the landline. They can waive the fee if you take a package with them, but then you're paying more anyway.  Edit: and if you're under 26 you can get a good deal on this... While it lasts!"

Switzerland,3ajm3z,ruggar,2,Sun Jun 21 08:06:39 2015 UTC,if you live in one of the supported areas: fiber7 by init7. Doesn't get any better than that.  They are also very outspoken about net neutrality.
Switzerland,3ajm3z,hans_mopf,2,Sun Jun 21 07:03:13 2015 UTC,"Not sure what not-so-expensive means in the context of CH and internet, but check whether fiber7/init7 is available where you are. Fiber good, price comes to 65 CHF/m (but in an annual lump)."
Switzerland,3ajm3z,memeid,2,Sun Jun 21 08:41:11 2015 UTC,"Never had problems with Swisscom, can't speak for the other ones. Don't choose UPC Cablecom.  Edit: I use UPC Cablecom atm and get downtimes (< 5 min) from time to time. (It's not a problem with my PC, as it happens on phone and other computers too.) For ""normal"" surfing that isn't that big of a problem, but it can be very annoying when you're gaming online. That's why I wanted to let the OP know. Maybe it's just bad luck, maybe it happens to just a fraction of customers, or maybe my modem just is shitty, idk. I never had downtimes with Swisscom without previous notification (these were longer downtimes though).  Edit2: I had been using Swisscom for 8+ years and have been using Cablecom for some months now."
Switzerland,3ajm3z,CaptainBlagbird,5,Sat Jun 20 21:13:12 2015 UTC,"I had Cablecom for around 15 years now, the only time they fucked up is when they sent my modem to the wrong address when I moved and it took forever (read 1-2 weeks?) to correct that.  All the other times I my money's worth of speed. Sometimes more speed than I paid for - not sure how that works.  And three times they actually helped me quite speedily: One time I fucked up with a stupid network configuration, one time their equipment failed the house I lived in (6 parties) - fixed in 4 hours - after 1800 and one time I needed an adapter for my socket (technician came, free of charge).  I've had very very few outages, DNS server failed me so I use google's and a few times their network in my area was indeed down - this happened like 4 times a year for about 1 hour each. Most of the time after 2300.  But of course: If you are in a urban area with fiber - get that."

I'm still satisfied with their service overall, and the speed/price ratio is definitely very good, but if you're after the most reliable network in terms of availability, they definitely don't come out on top."

Also its pretty cheap in comparison to Swisscom and we already got free upgrades 3 times without asking(75k>100k>150k). In the First upgrade they even lowered the monthly fee without any other change. Even the support is better, i needed it 2 times and both times i received help from someone that actually spoke swiss german. The only downside is that the upload is pretty low compared to others, 15Mbit/s but unless you plan to host that should be plenty."
Switzerland,3ajm3z,realape,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:57:07 2015 UTC,Once you go fiber you never want back. I can recommend iway. Great customer support (the first guy I got on line was able to reset the lease on my end) and symmetric speed for a reasonable price.

Switzerland,3ajm3z,as-well,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:45:55 2015 UTC,"I had better service with Fiber7 than anywhere else, the real difference is that if you can make sense of the Fiber7 homepage, you don't need any support in configuring/debugging your internet. And the callcenters are what's expensive for ISPs."
Switzerland,3ajm3z,lawl0r,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:41:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah so basically it is using your resources for solving technical problems instead of theirs. You are quite right, the support is expensive, clocking in probably around 30-40 bucks per man hour. Fiber7's business model are people like you who do not need the support, and since they are not offering phone lines or TV, they cater to customers like you (and me) who most likely are tech savvy enough to never all them."

Switzerland,3ahsfh,SatoyS,14,Sat Jun 20 14:52:12 2015 UTC,"It's the same as with the telemarketing calls, when you say ""No, thanks"" it takes way longer, because if you are polite they often go on with the conversation. When you are rude (Is this some telemarketing bullshit?), they just say ""sorry for bothering you"" and hang up.  This has nothing to do with being insecure! You can say, that I should always be polite, which is 99% of the time what I do, but in this case the others are just asking for a big ""Fuck you"". It is unacceptable to ring at a strangers door and talk about religion. And ""thanks"" is a word I mostly use when I am thankful or at least appreciate the intentions the others had, so it does not suit to this situation."

You can just look at the big board at the Zürich HB and see what the best connection is once you're there. Don't stress it too much. Getting to Zug from the Zürich HB should be really easy at 11:30 on a weekday. If you are struggling figuring out which connection to take once you are in the Zürich HB then you can go to the information Kiosk (near the departures board) and get help.

Either you take the xx:04 which goes to Lucerne via Thalwil/Zug (I think this train comes directly from the airport! --> best option) or the xx:09 which goes to somewhere in Ticino via Zug/Brunnen/etc. At xx:35, there's another option.  There's also the S24 which leaves at xx:21 or xx:51, but they take more time.  At the HB there are timetables everywhere (electronically and on paper)!  PS: for the app, try Zug, Metalli/Bahnhof"

Coca Cola runs three factories in Switzerland one in Vals (only for ""Valser water""), one in Bolligen (closing) and one in Dietlikon. (http://www.coca-colahellenic.ch/About_us/Production/Plants/) I don't think that Coca Colas from Switzerland are exported (besides maybe Liechtenstein) because the production costs are considerably higher in Switzerland than in its neighboring countries. As u/variousbiscuits has said the difference in taste is probably mainly due to protective sugar laws that other countries have as well. However, if you are really set to drink the ""Swiss coke"" in the US I'd directly ask someone from Coca Cola Switzerland and if that doesn't work you can send your address in my inbox and I will send you a few bottles personally ;-)"

I searched in 5 stores before coming here, and went to Globus and Jelmoli after this post before going to Manor. Neither Globus or Jelmoli did have the thing I searched for either.

Switzerland,3a9f59,Wublub,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:27:42 2015 UTC,"By now there is probably not much snow on the Faulhorn, so sledding will be a challenge.

Switzerland,3a9f59,futurespice,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:12:01 2015 UTC,Will be there in early December?
Switzerland,3a9f59,erschtedez,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:54:59 2015 UTC,"First of all - when are you going? You won't have fun sledding until there is a lot of snow... usually from mid january to end of march.  The most useful website of switzerland: http://fahrplan.sbb.ch/bin/query.exe/en  Here you can find all the train, bus and boat schedules you need.  I have sledded the ""big pintenfritz"" and you are right, the information on the websites are poor. But here's one way to do it: In interlaken Ost (there are two train stations in this town!) you take the train to grindelwald (30 mins). If you arrive, you leave the train station to the left and walk up the village to the Firstbahn (10 mins, you could take the bus, it's like 2 stops). At the bottom of the teleferry (or anywhere else in grindelwald), there are sport rental shops where you can rent your sleds (if I remember correctly 15 chf each). At the teleferry, you pick a plan of the region, which will be very helpful to understand where you're going. At the top, your hike starts - some nice 2.5h uphill to the Faulhorn (not the actual top with the restaurant, you'll recognise the start of the sledding track). From then the fun part starts. Depending on how much snow there is, you can sled down to the town or you have to change to the bus (there are plenty heading back to grindelwald) earlier on the route. About shoes - pleas wear good, waterproof, high ones (no sneakers), and waterproof trousers. Don't forget gloves etc.. You will be hiking through snow, and even though they prepare the path there are some places you'll sink into it. Especially during the sledding part it will soak you with melting snow and I've seen quite a few tourists that weren't enjoying their trip at all because of their light clothing. If you have more questions, pm me!"
Switzerland,3a9f59,erschtedez,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:26:48 2015 UTC,We are going in early December (1st-5th). We have full ski gear. Snow boots/pants/jackets. What will the snow be like around then? :( What do you think the best mountain would be at that time for sledding? We were also planning on going to schilthorn
Switzerland,3a9f59,erschtedez,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:56:50 2015 UTC,"Early december is a gamble, to be honest. Schilthorn is a bit higher than Faulhorn, but at the beginning of the season there is no garanty for snow anywhere except glacier resorts (Zermatt, maybe Saas Fee, I don't really know much about them). I would recommend you to be flexible and look at http://snow.myswitzerland.com/snow_reports/?lang=en as well as the homepage and webcams of different ski resorts a few days before you go. There were years that we had a lot of snow early in the season - hope for the best!"
Switzerland,3a9f59,erschtedez,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:25:26 2015 UTC,Sorry for another question - but what's the cheapest (to get up) near Interlaken for sledding?
Switzerland,3a9f59,happl,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:39:46 2015 UTC,"That I don't really know. It depends on the kind of public transport ticket you have, there are some discounts coming with them. If you are looking for cheaper snow experiences near Interlaken, Hasliberg (very small resort) might be something, but I don't know how fun it is. Another would be Adelboden, which is a bit bigger. Compare it to the Firstbahn (discount price about 20chf one way), which could be actually cheaper in the end when you have something like the swisspass for public transport."
Switzerland,3a54ou,whymesobad,13,Wed Jun 17 08:31:43 2015 UTC,"The comments are hilarious. I believe the article favors the view that we need the immigrants for our developement but it can also be viewed as that it's getting crowded.  Meanwhile we're still regarded as one of the wealthiest nations and I think it's wonderful to live here.  With all the people fleeing from other countries, why couldn't we just build camps or use military facilities to intern them, give them work and pay and finance the whole thing with the products of such facilities? Meanwhile we educate their kids to become ""proper"" citicens and so we will solve the whole immigration problem.  Oh wait is this maybe unethical?"

The sad thing is if you would ask people on the street and formulate it like that then a lot of people would actually think it's a good idea.  I was once at a party and some idiot had some slightly racist views so to make fun of him I would act as if I supported him but with even more extreme views. Kind of like you just did in your comment. So instead of saying ""lets mark all the foreigners with a star and put them in concentration camps"", say something like ""wouldn't it also be better for the police and the well behaving foreigners if they could clearly be recognized?"". I was shocked how many people actually supported me and didn't realize that it was supposed to be a joke. And this wasn't some kind of right winger party or so, it was a normal student/house party.   it's getting crowded   btw. I hate this argument against foreigners, I can't hear it anymore. If you do the math then we would need to be 120 million in Switzerland to have the same population density as Singapore (yes, that excludes the mountains in Switzerland). And even Singapore has still green areas left. London has over 8 million in an area of the size of the Canton Zurich. Theoretically we could almost double the population size and still leave 95% of the country totally unchanged. There is more than enough space. Also more people = more taxes, so per capita little changes, actually with qualified immigrants it even improves so the government has rather more money to spend on infrastructure. It's not like the Swiss government can't afford it to spend money. Taxes are low and the country as almost no debt.  Sorry, that was a bit off topic from your comment :)"
Switzerland,3a54ou,whitepalms85,2,Wed Jun 17 23:09:47 2015 UTC,I was told once that by definition those camps would be concentration camps which is why they are forbidden by international law. Anybody know if that's true?

If you assume it was a similar rate dating back to 1981 then that amounts to 947'000 Swiss people.

Switzerland,39yxps,Xorondras,16,Tue Jun 16 19:38:43 2015 UTC,You can easily live in the French-speaking part without knowing any German at all. e.g. almost all of my family. But some professional jobs will require you to have a working knowledge of German.
Switzerland,39yxps,jacquesrk,11,Tue Jun 16 00:19:39 2015 UTC,"What you need to understand is that the speakers of the different languages are mostly geografically seperated. In the most general of terms the west is French speaking, the middle, north and east are German speaking, in the Alps in the southeast there are the villages that speak Rumantsch. The eastern part south of the Alps (Kanton Tessin) is the Italian speaking part and the western part south of the Alps, well that's Kanton Wallis which is mostly French speaking and those who speak the walliser dialect of Swiss German are really hard to understand even for a lot of other Swiss.  Illustration  In the western part you will be fine with French. Everywhere else English or French will almost certainly get you through wothout problem. After all we Swiss learn English and at least two of the national Languages in school. Generally those in the German part lern French and those in the French part learn German. Those from Tessin can choose I think? Those from the Rumantsch villages often lern Italian and German I believe."
Switzerland,39yxps,Kazumara,10,Tue Jun 16 08:48:26 2015 UTC,"It is also worth noting that English is understood by a fair amount of Swiss citizen, so there is that. German (or Italian) is not mandatory but are great languages to master as it will open a lot of opportunities."

Switzerland,39yxps,ruggar,5,Tue Jun 16 04:48:56 2015 UTC,"I'm from the french side of Switzerland.   Ya there's really zero problem. I've lived here my whole life almost and have pretty much never had to use my German apart from with part of my family that lives near Zurich and Berne, but even then most of them speak good french and english so there was never really any problem.  Also there's no place in Switzerland, or the non English speaking world really, where you can be 99% fine with just English, as in Geneva and its surroundings. Most important things in Switzerland are in 2-5 languages.  In conclusion, I'm from the cantons of Vaud and Valais, both french speaking, yet part of my family is from the cantons of Berne and Aargau, and I speak french, english, and although I don't really have to use it I can communicate in German (and probably Italian from knowing french). If you come to Geneva or Romandie, you probably won't even hear a word of German in your daily life, and the region is so international that it just wouldn't work if everyone had to know several national languages. I went to an international school near Geneva, and tons of my friends literally can't speak a sentence of any national language (which is a bit shitty imo) but they're completely fine.  Edit: Also, the fact that the german speaking part of Switzerland use a ton of dialects makes it a lot harder for a french speaker to learn german, than the opposite. Most people on the french or italian side that speak german, learned it from school and it's high german."
Switzerland,39yxps,SwissBliss,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:16:19 2015 UTC,I just want to add in response to your edit: Fuck those from the German part who refuse to even just switch from dialect to German when Romands are present! It's really the least we can do and yet some assholes refuse because they feel a little less comfortable speaking German rather than dialect.
Switzerland,39yxps,Kazumara,5,Tue Jun 16 22:24:19 2015 UTC,"I am Swiss and do not speak a word of German. You will be absolutely fine, and everyone there speaks English. Honestly you do not even need French and would still get by absolutely fine."
Switzerland,39yxps,NewGuyCH,5,Tue Jun 16 09:15:25 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! A lot of Swiss citizens only speak one of the official national languages, plus English in a lot of cases, obviously they're  fine.   But yes, you might be limited to Western Switzerland as far as employment is concerned, and even knowing only French and English may lock the door on you for a minority of jobs that may require German (or less commonly, Italian). Granted, Western Switzerland is still a pretty large chunk of the country, there are plenty of jobs to be found in Genève, Neuchâtel, Fribourg, Jura, Vaud and Valais (well, maybe not Jura -- no offense to anyone from there but it's a small, mostly rural/agricultural canton). Geneva and Vaud are heavy hitters in the economy of Switzerland, and they're both French-speaking cantons."

Switzerland,39u6lk,ho-tdog,8,Sun Jun 14 21:24:30 2015 UTC,"I think instead of doing anything official (like voting for what dialect should be standard), instead it should be waited out. Maybe a written standard will emerge, maybe not. We don't need one.   Personally, I favour a system like Romansh has: Make some standardized macro-dialects (such as Zürich or Bern) and keep using High German for official texts. As long as the regional varieties are kinda similar, it shouldn't be a problem. And if they stray apart, well, then we havd 20 official languages. So what."
Switzerland,39u6lk,BoneHead777,8,Sun Jun 14 23:49:31 2015 UTC,"The only way this will ever happen is if we'd drop Standard German all together, but I somehow doubt that I will live to see this.   I sure as hell hope we don't. It takes a lot longer to read Swiss German especially if it's not in the dialect you are most accustomed to. It also seems to me as if people are a lot sloppier and less precise when writing in dialect. I don't know whether that is due to the meagre choice of tenses and modi in Swiss German dialect or just due to laziness of the people writing. Probably both, but who knows which effect contributes how much to the problem.  PS: ladder, you meant latter."
Switzerland,39u6lk,Kazumara,3,Sun Jun 14 23:58:31 2015 UTC,"It also seems to me as if people are a lot sloppier and less precise when writing in dialect.   Written swiss german is too percise. That's the problem. Everyone is writing down dialect-specifics, so you have to mentally switch to a different dialect when reading.  A standard written form would have to do the opposite. Be as dialect-netural as possible, and maybe put some makers down to indicate different readings.  For example, the L-vocalisation in many western dialects: alli vs. aui -> ałłi. Vogeł, Bałł, Vokał, etc. While we're at it, maybe mark the nd -> ŋ soundchange: anđers, binđe, etc.  Then for other things you have to go back to the middle-high-german (middle as in time, and high is an geography, eg. the south). The system of vokals doesn't adopt the changes in monophthongs and diphthongs of the central-german-based standard language (Ziit -> Zeit, lieb -> liib). We learn about some diphthongs in school, for example how ""ei"" and ""ai"" are actually pronounced ""äi"" in standard german (Stein, Kaiser). You could actually keep these, and just teach how they are pronounced in a specific dialect (so people from the east don't write ""Stai, Kaiser"", and people from the west don't write ""Stei, Keiser""). Or you could create a new one, like ""Stëi, Këiser"". You could do the same thing for others, redefining the pronunciation or creating new ones, for example ""Boum, Böum"" would be pronouced ""Baum, Böim"" in the east, ""Boum, Böim"" in the west. Consequently nöu, boue, etc. which in some dialects would be pronouced ""nüü, buue"". Because soundchanges are consistent, tracking the origins, the phonology, rather than trying to write the sounds (phonetics), you could create a system that can be read in a certain dialect consistently. Or you know, close enough.  It would look weird and wrong, but only if you didn't grew up with it. It becomes harder to write than just writing down the sounds, but learning how to spell everything is exactly what we're already doing with standard german anyway.  That things aren't actually pronunced like they are written is common in standard german too (and english, lol), but we just forget about it the more we get used to writing and reading it.  The biggest challenge, but also the biggest advantage of a written standard swiss german, would be syntax. For that, you'd need to define how particles and pronouns are written (and always write them fully if not contracted, der das dir däm etc), throw away the glue-n's and embrace the contraction maddness.  For example, you could allow these possiblities (how they might we written today in parenthesis):   I ha's dir gseit  (I has dr gseit / Ich hanns dir gseit) I ha'dr's gseit (I ha drs gseit / Ich hann dirs gseit) Är miech's iim (är miechs ihm / är miechs em) Är miech'm's  (är miech ems) hängt a'm'e Boum (amne Boum, amene Boum, am e Baum)   But never:   I ha's dr gseit I ha dir's gseit Är miech's m Är miech iim's hängt am e Boum   Much of the differences between dialects is how those contractions sound, but they usually work in the same way. If you write them down the way they sound, with the rythem of the specific dialect, they start to look very very different. But the difference is usually if a specific contraction is made, not how it is made. You could still allow those differences in wheter or not a contraction is written, but when they are written, it should be in a way that at least doesn't conflict so much with the other dialects."
Switzerland,39u6lk,argh523,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:08:51 2015 UTC,"That's quite interesting and some of these ideas sond pretty clever. You're right about the syntactic precision I think.  I really didn't mean the syntax though. In my experience people express themselves less precisely in grammer and vocabulary. Simpler words are used, shorter sentences with less clauses are built, the tenses are mashed together wildly and no one uses foreign words (except those few older French ones that only exist in Swiss German dialect and not in German)."
Switzerland,39u6lk,Kazumara,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:26:41 2015 UTC,"Because we aren't used to it. I agree, reading Swiss German takes longer than Standard German, but that probably would change if we'd read it every day."

But honestly, I suppose it could have a better effect than that of having to learn High German, as people would feel there is a genuine Swiss language (with its own orthography, grammar, etc...), stemming from one of its dialects.   Other dialects could still exist (as they in fact do in other countries with standardized languages, like Norway or Japan), but having its own language would be nice."
Switzerland,39u6lk,ho-tdog,7,Sun Jun 14 21:43:12 2015 UTC,I'd imagine the standard Swiss German would either be the dialect from Bern or the one from Zürich.

Switzerland,39u6lk,Herr_Buenzli,4,Sun Jun 14 21:49:40 2015 UTC,"It would not be easy to pick between either of them, with both cities being of importance, but I think it could be the one most understood overall in other cantons. Don't know which one, though. Either way, they are closer to other dialects than High German is.  Such move would not be a bad thing. A Swiss language could reinforce the feelings of Swiss identity, as languages have the power to do so. It could be taken ahead.

In the cities the dialects become kind of washed out and I find we use more words from Standard German with Swiss pronunciation rather than an actual word from our dialect.  I don't see however that we get a standardized dialect that everybody would speak because even the people from Zürich Oberland don't talk like the people in the city. Same goes for Bern: People from the Bernese mountains are often laughed at in the city even though they all speak Bäärndütsch.  That and the Kantönligeist and each and everybody's identification with his or her very own flavor of the dialect will stand against a standardization.

Switzerland,39u6lk,Chrisixx,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:22:00 2015 UTC,"I've never seen anybody be able to do this convincingly as an adult. The language (or languages since there are many) are always morphing and developing, with more English words being added seemingly every year. And the intricacies are just so weird the only way you can really learn is as a child, at least from what I have seen.  Amazingly, this is true even for Germans, though a few might learn to speak it somewhat convincingly after a few years (they all come to understand it though, and Swiss people understand them, so they can communicate perfectly well that way)"
Switzerland,39u6lk,BoneHead777,8,Mon Jun 15 11:38:50 2015 UTC,"It would be nice to have an official language called ""Swiss"". But in the end the dialects are too diverse to standardise probably, and it would only lead to tension when we chose some Bernese word as the ""standard"" for some word instead of the version from another dialect, etc."

I know that for reasons of butthurt reduction in the Zürisee region we call it ""seat of the federal government"", but I don't care, for all practical purposes it is our capital.  On your second point; if we'd choose Basudütsch we could as well stay with High German, the latter at least sounds better."
Switzerland,39u6lk,tetroxid,2,Mon Jun 15 21:02:44 2015 UTC,"De jure ""federal city""; de facto capital. Due to historical federalist sensibilities, Swiss law does not designate a formal capital; and some federal institutions such as courts are located in other cities.   From Wikipedia. Obviously it functions like a capital city, doesn't change the fact it's not officially one. The fact that it's the ""capital"" also doesn't make the dialect worthwhile."
Switzerland,39u6lk,Ed-Dee,0,Mon Jun 15 21:08:28 2015 UTC,"Nope, it's a bonus. As I wrote above. The main reason for me is that it's probably the least hated dialect."
Switzerland,39u6lk,tetroxid,2,Tue Jun 16 06:11:47 2015 UTC,"Something to keep in mind about the increased use of dialect in text messages is that these are mostly between young people from the same region (who are friends from school or whatnot), therefore they will be in the same dialect.  I always found it highly annoying to write in Swiss German so will just answer people in high German. Feel like that's the standardized (written) form of the language for a reason."
Switzerland,39u6lk,Ed-Dee,3,Mon Jun 15 11:31:40 2015 UTC,"It's only annoying for me if it's a dialect far away from mine (Bern). So Fribourg, Oberland, Aargau, heck even shudder Züri are fine, while wållïßērdītsçh and similar suck massive hairy monkey balls."

Switzerland,39t2n6,DeepDuh,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:35:39 2015 UTC,"No taxes at all. Still Billag as we know it, except they don't have to check anymore if you watch TV. Which was pretty much the only thing they did. They were pretty smart: the amount of people who don't watch television rises (because of other possibilities like netflix for example), so what should they do? Change the law, that everybody has to pay sounds good! And to make sure it will be accepted, they made it 60 CHF cheaper. Which is a big joke, with the extra money they get now and the money they save with less people employed. And the best thing is, the Bundesrat can change the price whenever he wants! YAY!"

Sure, but nowhere in economy you can just offer something and charge anybody for might using it! Is it so hard to believe, that there are people in this country who are not watching television at all? I have my movies and series without advertisment whenever I want them. For news I have Tagi/NZZ (both you can have for free and they don't send any bills)! The old system was shit, the new one is even worse. Most of us agree that if everbody pay, it should be in the federal tax. Now we have the solution which makes nobody happy, well done!"
Switzerland,39t2n6,SatoyS,3,Sun Jun 14 22:52:15 2015 UTC,"Access is the only argument? I think the much stronger argument is that we could consider TV as a public service, like we do with other things that we pay taxes for. There are lots of things I don't need or use and still pay for it so everybody can use it either for free or at a lower cost.  The only problematic part of this argument is, if we consider TV as a dying media and if we have the opinion that SRG is not innovating its programming enough."

You have 50% off on most cable car (25% to the Jungfraujoch, Wengen and Mürren are included) The easies way to know which route has 50% off or not is to check the map of validity (~5MB).

You can use pretty much any train (with the possible exception of some small local  private train lines) as well as most public transportation such as buses or ships.  The most notable exceptions are cable car up to mountains. And even there you can get discounts with it a lot of times. And the other being the night lines which run on weekends after about 1 AM.

Switzerland,39tg2g,y_halo_thar,4,Sun Jun 14 17:13:27 2015 UTC,"In general you don't have to book tickets for specific trains in Switzerland (but there are exceptions as you mentioned). With the travel pass you basically do whatever you want.  Even with a regular ticket you're free to choose whichever train you please, within the limited validity duration of your ticket. I think you're even allowed to take a break and change train midcourse if you please (but I wouldn't swear on that one). But if there are multiple routes to your destination (e.g Genève -> Zurich can be either via Neuchâtel or Fribourg) then you have to pre-select the route.   To get prices on sbb.ch, use the form on the left of the main page: select your starting point and destination, and then you have to select a specific itinerary to get a price. Again: this doesn't mean you HAVE to take that specific itinerary once you buy the ticket, but the system won't give you price information unless you do that. There's also an official mobile application that works pretty well."

Once I found I had taken a seat that was reserved.. so I just moved to a different seat."
Switzerland,39tg2g,b4silio,4,Sun Jun 14 20:07:19 2015 UTC,"Hey there,  The train system is based on the itinerary, and not the time-schedule/train type you take, so if you take a ticket Geneva-Interlaken, you can take any train that goes there, or (mostly) any combination of trains to get you there. The trains you actually have to book in advance are rare. (The glacier express you need to book if you want to be sure you'll have a seat).  If you take the day passes, you just hop onto any train. (Small exception for some trains in very secluded valleys, but it's quite rare). As for the individual prices, the sbb.ch website is crap, but to my knowledge it's the only way to get the price. You just have to click on ""purchase ticket"" and it will tell you the price.  If you plan on traveling a lot in 4 days, you may consider purchasing the Halbtax (Demi-Tarif) which is half off any ticket. It's CHF 175.- (for a year) so you might be better off with the 4 days pass. (Geneva - Interlaken round trip is 142 CHF, so you will quickly go over the 213.- price if you do one or two more destinations)."

Having a good public service in terms of media is important for information to circulate freely.

Switzerland,39sevm,Hoohm,0,Mon Jun 15 12:28:06 2015 UTC,Then give me one argument FOR inheritance tax. I'm happy to discuss it
Switzerland,39sevm,xxn10,3,Mon Jun 15 13:13:28 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to oblige.  My argument has multiple premises that we have to agree upon or else it won't make sense. So I'll be listing them.  1) Do you agree that big gaps in equality is a social problem and we have to create ways to lessen that gap?  2) Do you agree that no tax makes ""sense"" in terms of: There is nothing logic about paying part of what you win/own when you work/consume?  3) Do you agree that the most powerful thing about living in an organized society is having the possibility to make more than if you would be alone? In a lot of instances, health care, science, art, etc...  4) Do you agree that reward effort is a driving force of our society and that we should enforce that notion?  If you agree on those 4 premises, I think you will agree with my argument. If not, I'll gladly discuss the ones that don't make sense to you and try to find why we disagree on them.  Now my argument: The main tool that our society has to reduce the gap between people in terms of wealth is taxes. Since society has to find ways to help everyone thrive, taxing wealth when you die is a low ""reset"" on people who have parents who have a lot of wealth. Because, why should I get such a big head start from my parents with their wealth? I have not earned it since I just got lucky. I have to earn my way up, not win from the start, sit back and relax."
Switzerland,39sevm,Hoohm,0,Mon Jun 15 16:09:33 2015 UTC,"Point 1 and 4 are contradicting. Or do you want to say there is reward to effort, but only until this line and no further?  Point 2: Taxes MAKE sense, the state offers you legal security and stability, infrastructure etc. In return you pay taxes for these benefits. The point of taxes is not and should not be to reduce the gap between people, but pay for the upkeep of the country and society.   Why should there be a ""reset""? The closest bond a human has is his family and his ""line"". Parents have always worked to give their kids a better life than they had etc.   You may ask how someone ""deserves"" to inherit the fortune of their parents or what right they have to it. But what right does the state have to take it away?   Every person should and can decide on their own what will happen with their money and property, if they think their children deserve it then fine, if they want to give it to the state or some organization, fine.   But the state taking a big chunk of your money when you die, money that was already taxed, is complete nogo."
Switzerland,39sevm,Hoohm,2,Mon Jun 15 16:19:49 2015 UTC,"I'm still unclear weather you agree with the problems linked to high gap in wealth distribution amongst a society is a problem or not.  I'll need you to answer so that I can respond accurately. And could you break up your answer in simple A linked to B so that's its less intertwined. Having a debate is already hard enough when you write :P  A) Taxes are useful in the way you describe, but what I meant is that there is no ""logic"" in a tax. There is a logic to pay for upkeep/work/etc, but the concept of having a third guy take 1% of what you paid your gardener is not logic to me. If I would pay as a service whatever the society upkeep costs, it would make sense. Do you see what I mean? The only reason I point it out is to get rid of the ""Taxing a dead man doesn't make sense"" argument which to me is applicable to any tax.  B) The law proposed to tax 20% of anything that was higher than 2million. Meaning that if your parents gave you 3million, you would have to pay 200'000, which, I think, is quite affordable and you would not be hindered to offer something to your children.  C) The government has no more right to take the money than anyone else. Linked to the ""no sense"" argument in taxing. Another thing, in Switzerland, we are the government, so if we decide that rich people have to get taxed, we give the right to ourselves. What's the right for a policeman to stop me from killing my neighbor? It's the same thing.  C) I don't agree on the fact that you can do whatever you want with your money. There are laws to protect citizens against citizens/corporations/government. I would not accept that you use your money to get someone to kill me for instance. The law also represents what you can do or not in society.  D) The ""double"" taxation argument is linked to my point 2), on tax makes sense. Taxing once doesn't make more sense than taxing 15 times."
Switzerland,39ptl2,SwissBliss,5,Sat Jun 13 16:07:19 2015 UTC,"For the second one, the amount can still be fixed by the cantons, but they will need to provide a base line.  It's not a basic unconditioned income like some wants to make it looks. It's a basis for the loans so every one has to have the same possibilities. Living in Zurich will still be more expensive than in Fribourg or Bern and the loans is not here to cover the cost entirely. At the moment, it's a lottery. Wrong region, you have no chance to get any state support."

Switzerland,39ptl2,ho-tdog,0,Sun Jun 14 06:47:59 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way: The state needs an amount of money. It gets this money through taxes. So it can divide the taxes between income, wealth and inheritance or it could just tax every Franc only once and simply tax income. If there are no wealth or inheritance tax, the income tax would rise, since the amount of money needed hasn't changed. So would you rather have higher income taxes, meaning less money/month for everyone or take it from somewhere it hurts everyone less? If you're about to inherit 2 Million CHF and have to pay 20% taxes on that, you still have 1.6 Million CHF more than before."
Switzerland,39ptl2,buyacasha,2,Sat Jun 13 21:10:34 2015 UTC,"That's just an oversimplification. It's also important to talk about why the state needs that kind of money.

""It doesen't hurt them"" really is a shitty argument in my opinion."
Switzerland,39ptl2,ho-tdog,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:19:07 2015 UTC,"It's also important to talk about why the state needs that kind of money.   Sure, but that's a whole other topic. Fact is all of our roads, schools, hospitals, etc are financed by the government. For what exactly we pay taxes has to be discussed, but a certain amount will always be there.   ""It doesen't hurt them"" really is a shitty argument in my opinion.   It was also not my point. I just said taxing ones fortune or inheritance hurts less than taxing ones income."
Switzerland,39ptl2,buyacasha,3,Sat Jun 13 23:08:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't want to put these words into your mouth. It's just that I've heard these two trains of thought a lot lately and I think they're not good arguments at all. Especially the second one (""taking the money from where it hurts everyone less""). I think that our country is in part successful because people do not think that way (Look at the vote to decrease the number of work hours per week.). I also think that if the government is rendering services to the people, it's also the people that should pay for them. Of course I am not against some corrections like progression etc. because some can contribute more than others, but in principal I think this rule should hold. So that's why I really don't like this ""It hurts everyone less"" argument. It just feels very much like banding together to put a tax on a small group of people while giving exceptions to almost everyone in order to get their vote. It just feels like dictatorship of the masses."

Switzerland,39ptl2,KingJoffreyTheBaked,3,Sat Jun 13 20:35:00 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on the inheritance tax: a) you are taxing the money three times: income, wealth, inheritance. Seems a bit unreasonable for me. b) for me it's rather unclear with the amounts that will be exempt from the tax. My family owns a KMU, and if I had to pay tax on the part of the company that I'll inherit, I'd have to take a loan because I don't actually get the money. I probably wouldn't want to do that, so I'd sell the company to some investor who has the money... but for the company it would probably be better to stay a family-owned KMU. For me, there are just too many variables that have not been defined properly that I can't vote yes on that."
Switzerland,39ptl2,Iylivarae,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:25:20 2015 UTC,"1 off all, money is getting taxed at every transaction, not just twice or trice. 2nd of all the freibetrag for the kmu is reccomended to be 50 millions, and the tax is reccommended to be 5%.  Canton vaud i think had something simillar for a long tine and not one kmu had to be sold because of that"
Switzerland,39ptl2,KingJoffreyTheBaked,2,Sun Jun 14 06:43:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean the money that I don't spend but save for later/the kids...  They recommend it to be 50 millions, but we don't know how much it actually will be, and because of that it's not a thing I'm willing to vote for."

Switzerland,39ptl2,P1r4nha,0,Sun Jun 14 08:27:26 2015 UTC,Saying YES is essentially supporting the AVS/AHV.   Every piece of stupid shit people come up with now is to support the AHV. Let's not pretend that is the reason for this initiative. It's just to sell it.  And even if it is.... You can't fix structural problems with AHV by such a band aid. It needs to be completely revised and nobody has the guts to take that on.

Switzerland,39m9vs,Christron,3,Fri Jun 12 19:01:11 2015 UTC,"Are you going for a hike or just sightseeing by cable car? I'm assuming the latter so here's my opinion:   Pilatus has imo a nicer view of lucerne and the lake. It's very touristy and kind of expensive. There is a new cable car but it's nothing special. It's possible to reach the top either by said cable car or by a cogwheel railway (the steepest in the world) from the other side (Alpnachstad). Thus you could do a round trip and have a ride by train or ship on the lake. Also, at the fräckmüntegg station 2/3 of the way up there is a tobogganing slide as well as a climb Park, but you'll need to check if it's open. Stanserhorn is a bit quieter and not so touristy. The view is nice too and it's probably less expensive. The cable car is special, as you can actually go onto the roof of the gondola while you ride up or down. But there's not really much else up there besides a nice view and the possibility for a round trip stroll of about an hour. For me, it's a less thrilling mountain, but nice nonetheless.   If you're in for a hike, get good hiking boots and hike up on either of them and take the lift down. Personally I prefer Pilatus for hiking but Stanserhorn might me less taxing."
Switzerland,39m9vs,elFlexor,2,Fri Jun 12 20:50:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. It helped me make a decision. Despite getting 50% off (thanks to a Eurail pass) on Straserhorn it seems like Pilatus is the better mountain regardless.   Have you ever been to Jungfrau?
Switzerland,39m9vs,Eldona,2,Fri Jun 12 23:36:14 2015 UTC,Jungfrau is even more expensive and probably the most touristy mountain in switzerland. I'd go somewhere else.. there are hundreds of mountains in switzerland

Switzerland,39m9vs,UltimateKitty,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:50:04 2015 UTC,"Half luzernien here. Plilatus is an amazing place to go to. Go by ferry from the city to the base of the mountain, its a long journey but you see the amazing views and it's very peaceful. Once you get there, I recommend you hike the mountain rather than take the gondela. You experience much more of the scenery and nature than being dragged up a cable car with loads of tourists. Also, bring a bottle of rivella with you! After your tiring but great hike, my favourite place to go in the city is the little ice cream shop next to the Starbucks. They make the ice cream there, its delicious but a bit on the pricey side (but its Switzerland, everything is expensive there). Finally if you have nothing else to do, relax in the park which is located in the middle of the city. Good to unwind and watch people come and go!"
Switzerland,39m9vs,UltimateKitty,2,Fri Jun 12 23:06:24 2015 UTC,Thank you very much! I'm choosing Pilatus based on all the comments. What is rivella anyway? It seems really popular i'll have to try it! And is that the starbucks that's around the train station? I'll check it out thanks!

Swiss pass and all those (www.sbb.ch and posts in this sub)  It's fairly safe to hitchhike, but rarely anyone stops. By the time I've made up my mind I'm already way past the hitchhiker..  I recently found https://sharoo.com/ - maybe that's an option?"
Switzerland,39ly73,hubraum,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:46:43 2015 UTC,but rarely anyone stops   Not in my experience.  A friend and I wanted to see how far we could go througg Switzerland without any money. We never waited more than 15 mins for someone to stop.
Switzerland,39ly73,Skinnj,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:44:13 2015 UTC,"I hitchhike quite a bit in Switzerland, and frankly it works really well. It cuts down my travel town from my little village to a larger city nearby by half, sometimes even more. Usually I wait less than 5 minutes in my village, and around 10 minutes at a local mid sized town. Cities are a bit less predictable, but if you really want to hitchhike, it still works fine - it just will probably be slower than with the train.  I don't know how this dynamic changes when you're f, but in either case I wouldn't hitch hike at night."

About Couchsurfing: It's funny I just made my host-profile for couchsurfing.com yesterday. I have a few friends who have been hosts for couchsurfer several times and I did also host a few surfers who I met while travelling.

Switzerland,39konk,am_not_original,2,Fri Jun 12 11:58:46 2015 UTC,"I think that having struck a payment deal with Billag, you need to go the extra mile and ask them to remove the poursuite (I think it's called ""radiation de la poursuite"") from your record.

Switzerland,39k9f7,SwissBliss,3,Fri Jun 12 08:57:31 2015 UTC,it would seem that the 4x Yes approach is mainly being taken by more Left parties.   Really? Weren't a lot of people in the last thread 1xYes (Genetics) and 1 or 2 or 3xNo?

Switzerland,39k9f7,buyacasha,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:37:39 2015 UTC,Mhh maybe. I am pretty sure that only the diagnosis one is a certain Yes. Billag might pass. Inheritance and Stipends will fail big time I think.
Switzerland,39k9f7,Iylivarae,2,Fri Jun 12 15:36:35 2015 UTC,for me it's going to be 2x Yes and 2x No (being the Erbschaftssteuer and the Stipendieninitiative).
Switzerland,39k9f7,P1r4nha,2,Fri Jun 12 15:41:30 2015 UTC,"For me it's going to be 3 times Yes for sure. On the stipend initiative I'm still on the fence. I'm not sure federal control would actually solve the problems raised in the discussion.  Most of the initiatives are not ideal (in general of course), but sometimes the status quo just isn't better than a yes to something flawed.  Like the estate tax for instance. Of all the leftist tax proposals that one seems to be one of the more reasonable ones. For me it's a redistribution of wealth clear and simple. It's not ideal, but when you look at the alternative (increasing wealth and income inequality) a yes vote isn't that crazy.  I had an interesting discussion about the genetics one. It was about limitations you want to set for science in general. You can't stop science, but you can limit what is general conduct using these scientific innovations. With the genetics initiative we're getting closer to designer babies. I'm honestly not worried about that so much, but there's a reasonable argument for a no vote in there, even though I don't think we have reached a problematic threshold yet."
Switzerland,39k9f7,P1r4nha,2,Fri Jun 12 09:16:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer  For me personally I think the genetics one is already accepted in surrounding countries and it would hopefully help reduce serious diseases and allow ""sick"" parents to have children without guilt. I can understand a NO point of view, but it seems like accepting that vote is more beneficial than rejecting it right now.  The other topics seem to be more politically based and down to how you believe the country/economy should be run."
Switzerland,39k9f7,freetheloli,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:35:05 2015 UTC,"Right, the genetics initiative is the one with the most moral decision. Yet the advantages you mentioned by far outweigh the risk of the arrival of designed human beings. Again: The alternative is just worse: Abortions instead of testing, having to go abroad to do a simple procedure and generally more emotional stress and turmoil for parents with not such an ideal genetic setup."
Switzerland,39k9f7,buyacasha,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:40:28 2015 UTC,"Also the risk of ""wunschkinder""  doesnt even seem like a risk Not like  its not a real Child just because somebody choose its eye colour.  I personaly wouldnt even mind if this would come somewhere in Future"
Switzerland,39k9f7,ndhansen,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:44:44 2015 UTC,"But think of the future. Something like this has the potential to radically alter our society. Of course, no one is going to care about eye colors. But forty years down the line, ""Wunschkinder"" might have a whole new set of chosen features than their eye color. Fat? Intelligent? Height? And a whole lot of things I can't think of right now. Of course, all these improvements will only be available to the rich. Things like these have the potential to completely divide people into rich and poor. And it will be visible from the day you're born until the day you die. Class mobility? Forget it, not possible anymore. Think of the religious divide this could create if radical Christians physically look different from radical Muslims. And on and on. There are literally a million different disutopias that can have their beginning in us having the power to form children according to our will.  Disclaimer: Of course that's not what Wunschkinder are about right now. But that's where it could be headed. I'm just throwing in a few arguments as to why this might be dangerous."
Switzerland,39k9f7,ndhansen,2,Fri Jun 12 15:30:29 2015 UTC,"I can't quite agree with the 20% Estate tax. I would rather just have a higher tax for high earnings. If someone passes down 3 Mio. to their heir, they will give up 600'000 in tax. Not too crazy, because there are still 2.4 Mio. left. But now for the next generation to be able to pass that on he will have to save up 600'000. And if he is in a low or medium income bracket that isn't so easy. If, however the income of his parents was taxed to a higher degree and they only passed down 2.4 Mio. to begin with, the government would have gotten the 600'000 but you wouldn't have to worry about a huge loss passing money down to your kids.  Edit: Is there any current petition to get rid of Billag? I want to vote yes on the ""Raise SRF's budget"" thing, but at the same time I don't want part of the money to land at Billag."
Switzerland,39k9f7,yesat,2,Fri Jun 12 10:39:46 2015 UTC,"I might have understood it wrong, but for the inheritance tax it would be 20% on the extra on top of the 2mil. So if you pass down 3mil it would be 20% of the 1mil that passes the 2mil bar, so the tax would only be 200,000."

I don't watch any TV (Got netflix for that) or sports. The only thing I might watch is the news. So I don't like it that I have to pay for other people's entertainment. Service public is important but please accept the fact that just because everyone has internet these days, that doesn't mean everyone watches TV with it. In fact, I think it's quite the opposite, the internet opens up other channels that weren't accessible before. Make the public channels as minimal and as informational as possible, that should bring down the cost. Also, I think it would be easier to pay it via taxes (Actually via Steuererklärung) and then scale the fees according to income. 400.- is still too much if you don't watch TV.

Even if I had to pay less I'm voting no because i can't accept this. Plus it would be a new tax. And this is illegal. Short speaking.  Getting rid of the Billag is the wrong way.

Switzerland,39k631,zoheirleet,6,Fri Jun 12 08:59:47 2015 UTC,"Swiss banks have lots of frozen assets from former or still active dictators. These frozen assets obviously don't belong to Switzerland but to the country of these despots. Once a country freed itself from these dictators, Switzerland is supposed to pay back the frozen assets so they can be invested in recovery and establishment of the new government.  The conservative majority in the Swiss National Assembly has watered down a bill that would make freezing and returning of these assets clearer and easier on a legal basis. The watering down involved limiting the crimes and kind of people that would prompt the freezing of such assets as well as a statute of limitations.  TL;DR: In the end this means that dictators can still keep their money in Switzerland without much danger as long as they are relatively well behaved and their crimes weren't that recent. Returning the assets to the governments who it should belong to is still not very easy.  EDIT: Apparently the decision involved a report or maybe even lobbying from the ""Anwaltsverband"". I don't think the motives to make this bill muddy are very clear. Maybe somebody with more insight could enlighten us."

Since the federal court pracitally banned the methods used to track filesharing activities out of privacy reasons in their famous Logistep verdict [136 II 508], the ""industry"" (read: this one guy's office) basically died out.  However, right now, the IFPI is seeking federal evaluation for the second time to enable those practices once again.  That being said, German Abmahnungen could theoretically be carried out in Switzerland even though I think it's highly unlikely that they will target you for the private use of torrents. Still, let me just point you to this article for further reading.  As a summary: Don't panic, torrenting falls into a grey legal area and persecution in Switzerland is improbable as long as you keep it private."

This is - in my opinion - incorrect as a theoretical and general statement. Just ignoring an Abmahnung might be justified for this particular case of torrenting for private use but not because there ""is no Swiss euqivalent of Abmahnung"" but because the practice is legal in Switzerland. Those to arguments do not equate from a legal point of view.  In many other cases ignoring a ""Abmahnung"" could prove to be fatal because - theoretically (hence the picture-case) - the legal instrument itself could be carried out by Swiss authorities. Therefore one can not just dismiss those papers because of their legal nature but only because of the underlying substantive law.  Secondly, the lack of codification does not mean something does not exist. For example, general terms and conditions are not codificated in Swiss law (contrary to Germany) and still, they are being used by everyone.  However, I apologize if If I somehow did not follow you correctly."
Switzerland,39b1h1,Ordnungsbusse,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:48:35 2015 UTC,"Given that there is no ""Abmahnung"" under Swiss jurisdiction, the question isn't just whether your actions were unlawful, but whether your behavior should fall under German jurisdiction. If they can't make a good case that you broke German law and that said German law should apply to you, their ""Abmahnung"" is worthless.  Of course, someone can report you to the police under Swiss law if they think you have committed a crime that is covered by Swiss law, and they can also sue you for damages in civil court. But they don't get to charge you a fee that you pay to a private party without taking you to court like they can with an ""Abmahnung"". In fact, if they tried a ""pay me a fee or I'll report you to the police"" scheme in Switzerland, you could make a pretty compelling case that they're engaging in coercion or even extortion.   For example, general terms and conditions are not codificated in Swiss law (contrary to Germany) and still, they are being used by everyone.   Absolutely. Swiss law, while predominantly based on Civil Law, retains more Common Law elements than most other jurisdictions on the Continent.

Switzerland,395r2a,gregsui,37,Tue Jun 9 13:23:06 2015 UTC,"this guy is an idiot, every sane person agrees. i hope he gets some jailtime and that it will be very difficult for him to ever get his drivers license back.  now this policeman... he scares me a little. he just seems unable to calm down and get professional once the situation is under control. yelling over and over again at someone who is cuffed on the ground just to vent your anger seems very unhealthy in general, but even moreso for a policeman. just imagine how he would handle himself under real,  life-threatening pressure. the answer is he would not be able to handle himself at all and any number of bad things might happen.  of course he is full of adrenaline after this highspeed chase and all that, but this is just an explanation, no excuse. you just cannot act in this aggressive manner as an uniformed official in public.   i am sure he already realised this, at least after he sees how people react to his display. hopefully he will be removed from streetduty or maybe gets some lessons how to handle himself better in this kind of situations.  all in all this is obviously a very atypical instance of swiss policework, in response to a very atypical criminal behaviour."
Switzerland,395r2a,xeribulos,17,Tue Jun 9 14:30:52 2015 UTC,I hear you but I sympathize with the cop. He just had to risk his life and the lives of people around them just because this fucking piece of shit has nothing better to do with his life than play gta in real life.
Switzerland,395r2a,royalbarnacle,23,Tue Jun 9 14:53:59 2015 UTC,Unfortunately that's their job. Just as well it's their job to stay professional after they caught him.  If they can't deal with this then they shouldn't be on the street as police officer.
Switzerland,395r2a,Syndic,6,Tue Jun 9 15:51:34 2015 UTC,Exactly. Every other person without police education would react like the policemen in the video.
Switzerland,395r2a,nola2,-3,Tue Jun 9 20:46:25 2015 UTC,"Just as well it's their job to stay professional after they caught him.   Lol, you can't train that. The police basically just had to risk their lifes because the other guy put other people's life in danger. Of course he is full of adrenaline. But honestly, he is just cursing at the guy. It would have been totally legit if they police had crashed the motorcyclist on full speed. What counts is to reduce the risk for the civilians and the police, the motorcyclist gave away his rights when he decided to put other people in danger. The motorcyclist was creating a threat for everyone. And he wasn't even harmed."
Switzerland,395r2a,whitepalms85,9,Tue Jun 9 22:52:37 2015 UTC,Of course you can train that.
Switzerland,395r2a,kitsune,2,Wed Jun 10 05:24:19 2015 UTC,"Clearly you have no idea what you are talking about. There is a big difference between a real life situation and some training exercise. How can you simulate the adrenaline rush and stress level? And it's not like regular policemen go all through some Navy Seal hardcore boot camp and have years of experience in high stress level situations or so. It's Swiss police, this was probably the most stressful day of his career."
Switzerland,395r2a,whitepalms85,8,Wed Jun 10 19:11:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the rider was an asshole for what he did. This doesn't take away from the fact that the aftermath could have been handled in a more professional manner."

The vigilante might still have resisted or tried some stuff, we obviously do not see everything. This could or could not be reason for his lack of calming down.

Switzerland,395r2a,hubraum,8,Tue Jun 9 22:02:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not a policeman but I think I can understand the police's behavior. I'm not saying it was acceptable, just that they were in a high-stress situation which, in that area of Switzerland, they're very likely not used to, so it got out of hand.  Biker was a complete asshole though."
Switzerland,395r2a,StuffedWithNails,3,Tue Jun 9 17:59:13 2015 UTC,"I agree. At the end of the day, police officers are ordinary humans like everyone else. So it's probably not surprising that not every police officer remains 100% calm in every situation ever in his whole career. I see no issue with it as long as it stays with words and doesn't become too extreme (racism etc), the cop is still doing his job without any excessive force that we can see. Swearing to relief stress is a completely normal reaction, I've done it plenty of times, especially when playing sports. So have many, many, many others."
Switzerland,395r2a,DeepBlueNemesis,19,Tue Jun 9 20:05:45 2015 UTC,"That's really not how the police should talk to people, even though he did something against the law."

Switzerland,395r2a,LuisTrinker,15,Tue Jun 9 13:52:48 2015 UTC,"But ""verdammte huere chrüppel"" are sure not the right words! The police is trained to stay calm in such situations, no excuses."
Switzerland,395r2a,nola2,17,Tue Jun 9 13:59:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. You got the guy. Subdue him, put him in cuffs, then repeat some mantra along the lines of ""Please remain calm while we wait for the car to take you to the police station, sir."" until he gets bored of cussing. I assume stuff like that's part of a police officer's training."
Switzerland,395r2a,funky_apricot,2,Tue Jun 9 14:23:15 2015 UTC,Totally agree.
Switzerland,395r2a,microsyntax,8,Tue Jun 9 19:32:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that person was driving recklessly and could have caused a lot of harm."
Switzerland,395r2a,C4p5ul3,19,Tue Jun 9 14:23:15 2015 UTC,That's true and he should be severely punished. IMHO loosing his licence for several years would be him getting off light.  But the police isn't and never should be the one punishing someone.
Switzerland,395r2a,Syndic,13,Tue Jun 9 15:49:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The law punishes the guy, not the police."

Switzerland,395r2a,hikari-boulders,-3,Tue Jun 9 15:46:36 2015 UTC,If you remain calm you wont be able to use quick actions. There are times to move from calm mode to 'shit is happening right now' mode
Switzerland,395r2a,n1nj4_v5_p1r4t3,3,Tue Jun 9 20:08:29 2015 UTC,But there is no trade-off. The police should be trained to stay calm WHILE in 'shit is happening right now'-mode.
Switzerland,395r2a,nola2,-3,Tue Jun 9 20:23:10 2015 UTC,If you act calm in a confrontational situation you will be over ran. They are taking physical control as well as physiological control.
Switzerland,395r2a,n1nj4_v5_p1r4t3,3,Tue Jun 9 20:25:26 2015 UTC,Of course the police can take over physical control when someone resists the commands of the police. And I mean 'calm' in not swearing at somebody. Of course they can shout and raise their voices at someone who doesn't obey the commands of the officers if they may be in danger.
Switzerland,395r2a,nola2,10,Tue Jun 9 20:36:01 2015 UTC,"According to the newspaper ""20 Minuten"" there is now a complaint against the police becouse of the words and the beating. On the site 20min.ch the users comment about the ""police brutality""."

But this is ridiculous, the guy clearly tried to resist while being arrested, so a few punches here and there are justified in my opinion. We did not see the whole thing while the camera was pointed to the ground, but it looked like he resisted arrest. The language of the cops is another thing of course, but I can somehow understand them after chasing this guy for so long."
Switzerland,395r2a,Syndic,7,Tue Jun 9 15:00:57 2015 UTC,"But this is ridiculous, the guy clearly tried to resist while being arrested, so a few punches here and there are justified in my opinion.   I disagree. Yes arrests do sometimes need the use of force to subdue a person. But punches aren't useful for that goal. Police officers should be trained to conduct arrests while they use appropriate use of force.  Regarding the language, it's unfortunate and I'd wish for our police officers to be above that but I understand that some angry words may come out in such extreme situations. So cussing someone out shouldn't be that much of a deal. But to threaten them ""Ich mach di fertig"" is way above that and should be addressed."
Switzerland,395r2a,DeepBlueNemesis,12,Tue Jun 9 15:57:35 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Yes arrests do sometimes need the use of force to subdue a person. But punches aren't useful for that goal. Police officers should be trained to conduct arrests while they use appropriate use of force.   They are called ""Schockschläge"" and are actually a part of police training. Unlike punches that a boxer throws, they are not meant to injure/knock out but to distract.   Getting someone to put their hands behind their back when they do not want to and are actively blocking you / pulling their arms close to their body is very hard to do. There are no magic pressure points you can press and no super-secret techniques where you can easily overpower someone. Try it with a friend, he's on his stomach and has his arms to his chest and you try to get both behind his back. It's almost impossible unless the difference in raw strength is ridiculous - and even then it isn't easy. And that's all without having to worry about your friend suddenly turning around and hitting you or kicking you in the dick. Or pulling a knife. Or worse. All things the cops have to account for in those situations.   So that's why the cops sometimes throw those distracting punches. Their aim is to hurt (not injure!) and temporarily distract the other guy, so he's losing focus for a short time and you can pull his arms, or he's moving his arms up to his face / crotch / flanks to protect them, thus allowing easier access for the police to apply some techniques without having to engage in a battle of raw strength.   I'm not saying that punching is always appropriate, or that every punch a cop throws is a ""Schockschlag"" (there are plenty of reasons for a cop to box someone and it'd be justified) but in this case it's what they are supposed to do because it's actually less harmful than the alternatives (because engaging in a battle of strength could easily result in ruptured tendons, strained muscles and other injuries beyond some simple bruises). We can't see what the cop did exactly so I can't tell you what he did.  The cop's language is unfortunate, but if you read the youtube comments you can see that it's heavily implied that the guy is known to the police, so in addition to the adrenaline and anger there could also be a deal of frustration fueling the outbrust. I'm not saying it's okay, but it's far from a reason to remove the cop from street duty (seriously wtf) or even particularily worriesome. It should be talked through, yes, but I don't think it's a big deal. The dude asked for it, he got what he deserved and is now trying the classic appeal to the ""Kuscheljustiz"" in saying ""I'm the victim in all of this! Have mercy!""."
Switzerland,395r2a,Syndic,8,Tue Jun 9 19:54:01 2015 UTC,"You bring up some interesting points, thanks for this.  But this part really irks me:   The dude asked for it, he got what he deserved   The police is not there to give someone what they deserve. That's not their job and should never be it.  Their job is to arrest people breaking the law with appropriate force and nothing more. If that was the case in this case is up for people to decide who know more about this than we redditors.  They're feelings should have a little impact on this as possible and certainly not leading to hurting someone more than it's needed to arrest him. Yes I'm aware that they are humans and as such not immune to emotions. But that's their job and they should try to do it as good as possible. Especially since they can get into unnecessary trouble and may even let the asshole get of lighter in the court than he should be."
Switzerland,395r2a,DeepBlueNemesis,2,Tue Jun 9 20:07:49 2015 UTC,"You are right - punishing is not what a cop should do (in fact they must absolutely refrain from doing so). However I don't see yelling at someone as punishment, personally. Shouldn't happen to that extent, but can happen as a reaction to stress. Needs to be talked about over lunch or something, but it's far from compromising his ability to perform his job in the extent shown here.   Excessive force is another subject, though it is sometimes hard to judge the exact amount of force required when you are actually partaking in the action and wrestling with a dude. Also you have to realize that ""how it looks"" is usually different from ""what it is"", a cop has a priority list when engaging in physical combat and ""Style points"" are very low on that list. We can't say how it played out in this encounter because we don't get to see it, but we can assume it takes a while juding by the cop's commands.   Also I'm assuming that the cop wanted to do nothing more than beating the shit out of that guy after the chase he gave them (even I got slightly angry just from watching that) and he was restraining himself to hurt the biker as little as possible, so he was cussing instead. Who knows. As I said before, I find the whole thing not perfect but it was pretty okay as far as arrests go."

I'd argue punching somebody can be pretty disabling and make subduing and cuffing much easier.  As for the language.... eh I personally don't mind, somebody like that should be chewed out. It's certainly not professional but than again I assume in such a situation adrenalin is pumping and it probably doesn't happen enough for every policeman to be used to it. I think some leeway should be given concerning that."

I'd argue punching somebody can be pretty disabling and make subduing and cuffing much easier.   All punches do is hurt people. It doesn't hinder their movement which is the most important part of an arrest. The only exception would be if you punch them into the stomach or knock them out. And both options are way over the top and generally not needed for a professional officer. Not to mention dangerous.   I think some leeway should be given concerning that.   I don't see that bad as well. Certainly not enough for him to loose his job. But I'd say it warrants some talk with his superior pointing out the unprofessionality of it.
Switzerland,395r2a,Graf_Blutwurst,5,Tue Jun 9 19:55:12 2015 UTC,As much as I can make out from the video the punches serve to discourage from further reaistance.  I can imagine having to cuff aomeone that is squirming as really hard.  And keeping someone subdued while the other guy is cuffing can't be easy either.  Sounds morbid but I guess it is a very efficient way to subdue somone
Switzerland,395r2a,DeepBlueNemesis,2,Tue Jun 9 20:30:14 2015 UTC,"All punches do is hurt people. It doesn't hinder their movement which is the most important part of an arrest.    It actually does. More precisely, it makes them predictable, which you can exploit with training.   Example 1: If you punch/kick someone in the genitals, they usually hunch over and press their thighs together. If you expect this you can grab them by the neck and pull, throwing them onto the ground.   Example 2: If you throw a punch at the head your opponent usually blocks (pulls their arm up) and sometimes even takes a step back or to the side. A cop can use that moment to take a step back and use that brief moment of respite to reach for their pepper spray or draw the baton.   What I'm trying to say is that there are techniques to subdue people, but real life is vastly different from the training room and you can't just answer violence with ancient chinese techniques of pressing a pain point or similar things. Especially since the police have to deal with a lot of drunks and drug addicts - and those people don't feel pain anymore, so you'd just break their bones because they resist beyond what is reasonable due to the lack of feedback from their body (aka pain)."

Switzerland,392bd6,InsanelyStupidHorse,9,Mon Jun 8 20:05:59 2015 UTC,"No, just tell them that you wanna do ZD, it's that simple. Nothing to worry about"
Switzerland,392bd6,seitgeist,3,Mon Jun 8 21:28:49 2015 UTC,"No, make sure you DO get into the military and send in a Zivildienstgesuch when you get back home."
Switzerland,392bd6,buyacasha,2,Tue Jun 9 11:50:11 2015 UTC,"The way I understand it, I don't think so.   Sie sind militärdiensttauglich. Die Zulassung kann daher frühestens nach der Rekrutierung erfolgen, an der Ihre Militärdiensttauglichkeit festgestellt wird.   But I am no expert on the topic, so take that with a grain of salt. Maybe call them tomorrow?"
Switzerland,392bd6,as-well,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:14:16 2015 UTC,"Tell them that you'll apply for Zivildienst which will have them treat you easily and not assign you to some elite military unit (makes there life easier, too, since they will have more slots to give to other recruits). The recruitment will most likely still be three days since technically you won't be allowed to Zivildienst before a certain wait period. Maybe you'll also get some infos on the Zivildienst on the third day. AFAIR you'll also get boots :)"

All of the people that picked something driving related had to stay 3 days back when I was recruited (10 effin' years ago) since they had to complete additional tests (IIRC).   Btw, they really do cup your balls and tell you to cough. I thought it was a bad joke..."

You have to stay half a day more usually. I was in Windisch / Brugg 2 years ago.  The whole recruitment with ""Eignungsprüfung A"" was 2 days long."
Switzerland,392bd6,Nelav,3,Tue Jun 9 10:27:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, you need to be double-tauglich and get a function from the aushebung. This does not matter, but you can be nice and choose a function that is not very popular as you wont take anybody's place. And you can only make the zd request once you have a function so after the aushebung.  After that just get the document, send it, and you'll have nice instructions. Also, if you need help, just call the zivi center, they helped me a few times."
Switzerland,392bd6,cynicbla,3,Mon Jun 8 19:52:30 2015 UTC,So there is no chance that Zivildienst can be rejected and then I’m stuck with something in the military that I never wanted? Should I tell the people there that I’m going to sign up for zd no matter what and that it doesn’t matter where they’ll put me then?
Switzerland,392bd6,Nelav,3,Mon Jun 8 20:02:26 2015 UTC,If you want to do Zivildienst is basically your own decision. Nobody can make you do Military service. You can even go to military the first day and after that state that you want to do ZD instead. You can always switch from Military Service to Zivildienst. Even After RS.
Switzerland,392bd6,cynicbla,3,Mon Jun 8 20:36:18 2015 UTC,"That's not completely true. If you tell them you want to do ZD on your first day they will just tell you to download the form, fill it out and send it in. And then you will have to wait 5 weeks for confirmation while you're stuck in the army.  So you should definitely send the form at least 2 months before the RS starts if you don't want to serve at all."
Switzerland,392bd6,Nelav,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:30:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe there are cantonal differences. But I knew serveral people that left the RS in the first 2 weeks (I was in RS with them, I saw them go - and they didn't fill out a form before starting the RS). The first 2 weeks ""are the hardest"" in a certain way to make everybody leave that doesn't belong there."
Switzerland,392bd6,P1r4nha,2,Tue Jun 9 16:28:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think there are any cantonal differences, since the army is on the federal level.  But was that maybe a few years ago? Because they changed it. A friend of mine started the RS one year before me, and when he sent in the form, he could go home just a few days later. But because this was abused they implemented a waiting period, so now you just have to wait 5 weeks.  I started my RS in 2010 and has been like this since then."
Switzerland,392bd6,Motzlord,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:06:33 2015 UTC,well i did RS in 2010 and 2011 and i believe both times it was very easy to leave right away at least in the first two weeks. but then again maybe my memory is wrong

I became a anti air person and they congratulated me for my position. Then I never saw a military institution from the inside again.  Make sure you do the civil service process correctly and not fuck up dates etc. They can pull you in as long as the civil service hasn't accepted your request yet."

But anyways, that's a topic for another thread. ;)   Anyways, I'd actually vote for conscription service for women. With the option to do Zivildienst lasting the same time as military service.

Seeing as fighting in a war would be quite a lot more dangerous than doing anything else, I'd disapprove of giving women the choice to danger-down to Zivildienst. They'd all be classified incapable of most things physical and instead of equality, what would happen is that they'd become glorified assistant medical personnel that ""serves"".

Switzerland,392bd6,ALTSuzzxingcoh,-1,Tue Jun 9 10:05:41 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is that since almost every woman would be incapable of performing military duties, they'd collectively be treated better than men, again, and thus the whole idea of equality would be ruined, even with the law requiring both sexes to serve. Either we should have army gender quotas or, more fairly, either only have military or civil service at all. Of course, the solution to our self-made health care problem is paying domestic workers a lot better, giving them better working conditions and removing unnecessary educational requirements to the state things were in in earlier times.  Interesting, though, that you feel offended at the idea of not giving women an equal choice when, right now, it's men that are basically choiceless. ""You can choose between being forced to do this or this!"" Wow, how generous."
Switzerland,392bd6,buyacasha,3,Tue Jun 9 13:22:17 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is that since almost every woman would be incapable of performing military duties   let me stop you right there.   The rest of what you said only makes sense if you assume that serving in the army is somehow more valuable (in what way?) than civil service. In wartime, when you are actually and actively risking your life, I'd agree. But because there is no wartime, and because men today have the choice between the two as well, equality would be to have women serve the same amount of days in either civil service or the army. And if they were ""unfit"" for military duty, then it would only be because   There is a certain physical difference, yes. Not impossible for most woman to handle though. Certainly not for ""almost all of them"". An army as an institution in it's current form is based on centuries of men and only men coming up with how it works. It's not anyone's fault that that might prove incompatible, but certainly not the women's.   The reason why I got pissed off is that you seem to like to belittle women and their ability to serve. Look, I'm all for equality and I strongly believe that women should fo their part as well, but as long as women still earn less than men and have other similar issues to deal with, I don't think we men have any right to complain."
Switzerland,392bd6,ALTSuzzxingcoh,-2,Tue Jun 9 16:00:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, the traditional appeal to sexism as an excuse for the exemption of women. You're more concerned with my ""belittling"" of women than with a misandrist organisation designed to send men to kill themselves if necessary. No value in arguing any further."

On the other hand doing army service is usually harder than Zivildienst, so I guess it's kind of a way to stop everyone doing Zivildienst.  About women in the military, I don't really care to be honest. Then again I am also not a fan of total equality anyway because, well, genders are not equal.    Nope, I want everyone's life on the line equally.   Doesn't it make sense to sacrifice men and keep as many women as possible alive? From a society building standpoint at least? ;)"

In any case, as I wrote above, I do agree with you that women too should do their part. But anyways, the decision has been made so why not just chill and live with it for now?

Leave all the fields that ask you about which function you want empty, or write Zivildienst. --> they will assign you to a random function, most probably Spitalsoldat since it is something that someone that doesnt want to do military service might even accept (I was close to accepting it).  Do the best you can in all of those test, sports too. You have to be ""militärtauglich"" to do Zivildienst. And you dont want to do Zivilschutz, it doesnt look that interesting if you ask me.  Once you are through the tests, and the officer tells you which function you will be assigned to, you have to accept even tough you wont do the service. But you have to be part of the army first to do Zivildienst.   At home do the linked procedure (buyacasha linked it) to get Zivildienst. And DONT FORGET to send them your ""Gesuchsbestätigung"" after the Bedenkfrist. You have a few weeks time.

Then you just send your parents or a friend to get the plates from the strassenverkehrsamt. They'll give you the paperwork and the plates right away most of the time.     Pay attention. If this is a car bought in the US it's maybe not legal to drive around in switzerland. They'll send you a letter demanding that you bring your car ro the MFK (periodic vehicle check at the STVA). You have to be there maximum 30 days after immatriculation.  If something's wrong they'll send you home. You then have to pay the bill for the first check up. Fix any parts on the car preventing it from passing MFK. And then show them the car again (withing 30 days after the first appointment.)  Edit: You seem to have a swiss adress because you added the ""moving"" tag to your post. You need to have one when insuring a car. Or you could insure it over your parents.

This would allow you to drive on US plates until the tech inspection, after which you would get Swiss reggo immediately (in Vaud it's over the counter).  You'd need to make sure your US insurance covers you in CH, though, and bring proof of coverage (similar to insurance green card we get in Europe)."

Either way, lots of places will be interested in that, and I would imagine a junior in this area (again depending on the city, exact job profile from the ones above and more, and of course the company) with no corporate experience would probably be on between 70 and 90k plus benefits depending on company policy.  Of course, it is a large range, but it is hard to know more exactly because each of the SAP fields are quite specific and have varying degrees of demand and supply.

Switzerland,38xhk4,swardoph,6,Mon Jun 8 12:24:41 2015 UTC,"Thunderstorms usually occur late in the afternoon. It's unlikely that you will get surprised by them at night. During the past few days we had some intense thunderstorms, this is common in June as well as (less frequently) in July.   A wisely choosen campside is key. Plan ahead. Thunderstorms do not come out of nowhere. Watch out for cumulus clouds on hot days. Getting caught on a ridge sucks I guess. I'm always happy to find uneven terrain or a spot in a narrow valley where I expect the flash to hit somewhere higher up.   Direct impacts are unlikely, step voltage is what I fear when caught right in it. I usually count the seconds between flash and thunder. If it's a second or less I fold my Evazotte a couple of times and stand on it in safety position, kinda like an human embryo but on my feet. Stay some yards away from water, metal etc.  Those storms do not last very long, like one hour or less. So if you are somewhat safe, relax and enjoy the lightshow in your tent."
Switzerland,38xhk4,Status_Gruen,10,Sun Jun 7 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"Our plan is to mostly camp at the higher altitudes near the passes   Camping at the actual pass 'peak' can be very dangerous due to the strong winds funneled through the gap between the mountains during storms. Camp a bit below the pass or behind a large boulder.

You should definitely avoid protected Areas. Moreover it's the best thing to just hide a little bit - if noone can see you, you won't have any problems.  About thunderstorms: They can appear very fast in the alps and forecast are not very accurate usually. Still it isn't very dangerous as long as you do not camp on ridges or plains. Whenever there are flashes nearby leave the tent and hide somwhere close to a rock for example.  If you need more help: Don't hesitate to ask.

Switzerland,38x3k3,Lejeune_Dirichelet,5,Sun Jun 7 20:45:46 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, mercenarism was outlawed after Marignano   It was outlawed in 1853."

Switzerland,38x3k3,Lejeune_Dirichelet,4,Sun Jun 7 21:08:29 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be too sure about this. Until end of 18th century, being mercenary seems to have been one of the main sources of wealth for Swiss Germans. When this changed (Napoleonic times, mercenaries couldn't compete with drafted national armies anymore), Switzerland became one of the poorest countries in Europe, leading to lots of emigration to the US.  Intuitively I'd say the mercenary trade was a side-effect of a Swiss culture that does in fact still heavily influence how we're doing business: The unwillingness to give much power to a central government, or to put it differently, the willingness and drive for self government, giving much more trust to local organizations rather than centralized ones. The armament of common people and then the mercenarism was just following from that, as was banking secrecy and lenient laws towards cooperative organizations. Without those, FIFA would probably never have located themselves in Switzerland. I wouldn't be surprised if they moved to a place like Hong Kong or Singapore now.  So yeah, mercenarism was not a cause, but it's IMO related to the culture that made this stuff possible. And btw. I'm also against changing too much of that culture. For organizations that only operate within Switzerland, this model has been very successful and as a Swiss citizen I feel freer than anywhere else in the world. If there's a 'land of the free' I'd put my finger on Switzerland, even after having lived abroad in different countries for some time now. What we do have to change is to not allow these rights to essentially foreign and/or international organizations that just leech on this leniency and have the potential to damage our culture. It's like inviting all the world's nuclear waste to be stored in the Uetliberg (i.e. close to where it can do the most damage)."
Switzerland,38x3k3,DeepDuh,3,Mon Jun 8 00:45:45 2015 UTC,"Also, weather got worse in the 19th century. Agricultural production was abysmal then, so there is another drive out of the country."
Switzerland,38x3k3,oelsen,2,Mon Jun 8 09:51:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's worth mentioning. Basically if your economy is completely agricultural and you get a few bad harvests, you're fucked. If more people work in other trades there tends to be money to import stuff, but Switzerland didn't have that back then. An interesting thesis is that it became wealthy again starting mid 19th through the lack of protection for intellectual property, in addition to the lax legal framework for the financial industry, plus the already existing watchmaker / fine mechanics trade in Western Switzerland. So, a bit like 50ies/60ies Japan and today's Singapore rolled into one."
Switzerland,38x3k3,DeepDuh,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:46:24 2015 UTC,"That is not a thesis but I thought a confirmed fact... (?)  At least here in Basel, this view is the norm.

Some of them require a permit to buy (easy) and a separate permit to carry (difficult).  As /r/simluk correctly points out, using those that do not require a permit outside of reasonable self defense constitutes simple assault and bodily harm (Art. 123.1 of the Penal Code) and is thus illegal and punishable by a fine or up to 3 years imprisonment; however, it is only persecuted if the victim chooses to press charges.

They did the same about speeding in April I think. It's preannounced because 1) you can't keep such a huge event secret and as you can see here it would intimidate people and 2) it's about keeping drunks from the streets, not punishing as many as possible. For the same reason there's a permanent speed trap sign at the Bözberg Tunnel even though there never was a speed trap during the last five years.

None that I'd be aware of.   Is subsequent registration with the municipality unavoidable?    Yes.   And after how long must I do so?    14 days. They're usually not gonna check, but I've seen municipalities who want a copy of your apartment renting contract (wtf?). The way around that is to get a written statement by your landlord that you are currently living at this address (but not since when). They don't care if it's three weeks or four usually, since having a contract does not mean you're actually living there. But you know, it might rise some eyebrows if it's a few months. On the other hand.. there are bigger fish to fry.   Are there any advantages in postponing this registration?   Yes, although I'm not sure they actually apply to you: If you're moving from a place with lower taxes to a place with higher taxes, you can dodge those for a while (until you'll need to register). But again: illegal and maybe not even worth it. If you're not making a lot of money taxes won't be a concern.  And.. what /u/Urgullibl said."

Registering with the municipality where you establish your domicile is mandatory and unavoidable; you will also need to deposit your certificate of origin ""Heimatschein""/""acte d'origine"" with them, which I would assume is currently at the Swiss Embassy in Athens.   If you want to seek employment, you will also need your AHV/AVS card (Swiss Social Security); if you don't have one, I would recommend contacting the Embassy prior to the move to get one. You will also be required to purchase health insurance (try comparis.ch to find the best rate) and pay tax on any income earned in Switzerland. Keep in mind that Swiss employers don't withhold income tax from your salary, so you will need to keep the money available for when you get your tax bill."

Since you're looking for US companies, there's a chance that English could be enough. At Google for instance they all speak English.  The work visa process doesn't require you to speak a single word of any language and your employer will take care about most of it.  Of course official documents will not be in English or translated to English for you, but you can find people to tell you what it means and what you have to do... or you actually go to the immigration or communal offices and ask the employees there, because they usually know English and explaining the process is part of their job.  Which language you want to focus on entirely depends on where you end up living. There is a map here.  First thing you want to do however is find a job. That's where the journey begins.

If it's a offense not punishable in Switzerland but in the US ... it would get interesting.   As you pointed out - we have the constitution that says one thing, and the treaty that says another thing. It would be up to the judge to decide. My guess? If it serves a (political) purpose, yes, there would be an extradition, even though I'd hope it would not happen, as I personally would hold our constitution higher than the treaty."

Treaties are part of international law, and international law is at a higher level than constitutional law.   Again, there is no consensus on which of those is the correct view at the moment.  And then the particularities of the Swiss system add a third view that is probably undisputed:   International treaties that are subject to a Federal referendum (Constitution, Art. 140 ff.) are comparable to constitutional or Federal law and therefore not subject to constitutional review.   This view is not directly relevant to the current discussion though, as the extradition treaty with the US does not fall under Art. 140 ff."

Switzerland,38b5uq,simluk,5,Thu Jun 4 19:37:55 2015 UTC,"To teach English at a ""mittelschule"" you need to have a master in English plus a teaching degree (which in Switzerland, for most universities, can be aquired alongside the master degree).  e.g. University of Zürich http://www.es.uzh.ch/teaching/MAS-SHE.html  How hard it is to get a job will depend on where you got your degree (and if Switzerland accepts that degree for teaching in public schools) as well as your german skills. Also competition will be stiff since we have a lot of English graduates and a lot of them get their teaching degree (hell the university even recommends you do) to have a ""save"" job lined up.  As for teaching at any other level in public school, that mostly requires a degree of education and native like fluency in german. Also those teachers generally don't only teach one subject."
Switzerland,38b5uq,Kempeth,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:36:06 2015 UTC,I would defiantly teach at an international school. But as I asked another person what would my chances be of getting a job there?
Switzerland,38b5uq,muenzfach,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:08:47 2015 UTC,In principle public schools require a formal training in education. But after a bit of causal digging I've found that at least some cantons have loosened their demands on teachers (due to a lack thereof) and only require a minimum age of 30 and 3 years of experience in the field. I would however add that if you want to teach at a high school (Mittelschule) level you should also be fluent in the local language. It may have changed since my time but I'm not sure we would have been ready for an English only class.  Another option besides the international school would be aiming for adult education often provided by independend institutes (like the Migros Klubschule) or as a side offer at high schools. Requirements there vary but generally tend towards language teaching certificates only. But I'd also expect more competition there and as such good German/French skills are probably expected regardless of whether or not the students could follow a lession held in English.  Edit: just found this at the English Teacher Association of Switzerland. It matches my instinct pretty well.

Switzerland,382q86,anonlymouse,2,Tue Jun 2 09:36:06 2015 UTC,That's just bullshit.  Most of our immigrants are from Europe and not some fucked up war thorn place. You should probably have more contact with our immigrant groups since you seem to have a very biased view on this subject.

Swiss system:    bewildering array of insurance choices, combined with unpredictable nature of health problems,  makes it impossible to rationally choose an insurance scheme.  Profit is taken at every level. Identical jobs are repeated 100s of times at various insurance companies.  Rich can pay for better care.  Doctors have no incentive to deny the patient anything, and will always say ""yes"". Useless tests abound, as does outright magic healing.  Insurance covers ""alternative healing"" leading to public perception that these businesses provide real medicine.  Payment upfront disincentivizes people from seeking care.    Canadian system:   No choices in level of care: all people rich and poor receive the same care at the same hospitals.  No profit means that all decisions are based on the health of the patient.  Care is based on sound science, not the profit motive: you can rest assured that you will never be operated on just to make some quick cash.  Centralized accounting results in far greater efficiency.  No payment by the patient: difficult health choices are not compounded by difficult budgeting constraints."
Switzerland,382q86,as-well,0,Tue Jun 2 10:26:21 2015 UTC,"bewildering array of insurance choices, combined with unpredictable nature of health problems, makes it impossible to rationally choose an insurance scheme.   Basic insurance is all the same, which is nearly identical to the nationalised health care Canadians receive, right down to the fact that out of province hospital trips are incredibly expensive. The Swiss system makes it much easier to buy insurance covering out of canton hospital visits for a much lower fee, while in Canada you need to buy 3rd party insurance.    Profit is taken at every level.   Good, means you can financially punish them by taking your money elsewhere if they don't perform to your expectations.   Identical jobs are repeated 100s of times at various insurance companies.   Good, we have a much lower unemployment rate than Canada.   Rich can pay for better care.   That's true everywhere.   Doctors have no incentive to deny the patient anything, and will always say ""yes"". Useless tests abound, as does outright magic healing.   They don't in Canada either, doctors get kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies.   No choices in level of care: all people rich and poor receive the same care at the same hospitals.   You've obviously never spent time in a Canadian hospital. You can pay for extra care.   No profit means that all decisions are based on the health of the patient.   Completely backwards. There's still a profit. Canada has a major problem with doctors only allowing one issue per visit, so they get the max amount of money possible per patient. It also clogs up the system and causes unnecessary wait times.   Centralized accounting results in far greater efficiency.   Evidently not. No matter how you cut it, Swiss are more efficient at nearly everything than Canadians."

Also, it is not about voting.  Also, the political process is about them just like it is about me.

If that is justification enough for them to have reduced (most proposals only give voting rights for town votes) voting rights or even only the possibility to start motions is another question.

The reasons why foreigners should not have the right to vote:   1) because voting is privilege for citizens who feel Swiss and who want the higher good of the nation, not just the good of their own religious or ethnic community.   2) if strangers had the right to vote, it would give some momentum to the left, which, for obvious reasons, would be bad for everyone.   3) it would mean that politicians would have to try to please strangers with specific policies, which would in effect destroy the national unity."

For example, the American economy affects us directly, yet we won't ask for a right to vote in America.   The regional aspect doesn't, or at least shouldn't, change what it means to vote, i.e. to act in favor of the greater good of you and your kins. Letting strangers vote goes against this, and it's a paved way to political chaos and hypocrisy like they have in France and in most Euro countries.

The issues for foreigner votes are:  1) Are the votes relevant to the foreigners?  2) Is there a chance of a conflict of interest?  The ""numbers of years lived in the city"" clause takes care of the first and the fact it's only local votes does the second."

Switzerland,382q86,pwforgetter,6,Tue Jun 2 12:58:23 2015 UTC,"Because they are no less concerned about local issues than anyone else, and so have the right to decide.  Examples of recent local votes are whether to allow the construction of a tower, to create a new theatre or to build new wind turbines. All these are made on local ground (which foreigners use) with local taxes (which foreigners pay): of course they should be allowed to vote!"
Switzerland,382q86,Elmarco84,-1,Tue Jun 2 13:05:24 2015 UTC,"Well, being concerned by certain issues doesn't give you the right to vote. I'm directly concerned by the American economy or French politics, doesn't mean I have the right to vote there."

If you don't, it means you don't want to be a citizen, which means no vote.    Some people cannot afford the money that it costs just to get the citizenship, meanwhile any millionaire can come to this country and buy their way to citizenship without giving two fucks about Switzerland, the culture and society. Also even after fulfilling all the requirements there's still no guarantee that you will become a citizen, and even after getting the citizenship, there's still the problem of not being considered a ""true"" Swiss because their family doesn't trace back to a shit ton of inbred ""Eidgenosse"" that lived in the same valley for centuries, these people are then called ""Papier-Schwiizer"", because even after paying a certain amount of money and going through all the bureaucracy to become a citizen, they still don't deserve to be called Swiss because their blood is somehow tainted.  Not to mention (Not really sure about this though) that you have to live for an X amount of years in the same commune, which falls back to zero if you move to another place. How logical is that? So a guy can live here for 30 years and still not be eligible for citizenship because he kept moving from place to place every 2 years.  That's why I understand why many people don't want to become Swiss.    Also, to reverse the question seems to me to make much more sense: if you've been in a town for 10 years, why should you have the same rights as someone who was born and raised here?    So a son or daughter of immigrants, which was born in Switzerland should have the same rights?"
Switzerland,382q86,Elmarco84,0,Tue Jun 2 13:39:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but there aren't that many millionnaires, so obviously you can't compare that to the situation with the average strangers.   I don't believe in this ""can't afford"" thing. It's just socialist victimization.   Also, you are somewhat a bit off-road with your blood-line delirium.   Sons and daughters n(of immigrants) shouldn't have the right to vote unless they try to get the passport, which should be a hard process because, well, Switzerland is much better than Zimbabwe or Macedonia."

The current system is also about buying votes. If someone has a C-permit for many years, they cannot vote, if they pay the fee (650+what gemeinde charges), jump through the administrative hassle, they become citizen and can vote. The administrative stuff would be to speak the language and do a test, but if you went to school here, that should be somewhat easy to pass."
Switzerland,382q86,pwforgetter,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:40:31 2015 UTC,"Yes I think so too. This is why I'm thinking that people who defend ""voting for strangers"" or this kind of opinions have something else in mind, like ""be more European"" or whatever nonsense."
Switzerland,382q86,hobo_mark,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:20:26 2015 UTC,"Why is nationality (the only) important to you as the deciding factor of who gets to vote? We agree it shouldn't be about money. Is swiss culture more similar between Zurich, Ticino and Waadt than between Zurich and Munich? If foreigners have a different motivation for voting, how do people with double nationalities align?  If in 50 or 100 years less than 50% of population is Swiss national (and there are 4th generation immigrants), should swissness still be the only factor?"
Switzerland,382q86,uzapy,3,Tue Jun 2 17:01:51 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. Ticino, Waadt and Zürich are very different in essence, yet we all play in the same team. How is it possible? Because we have a common history, common values, common laws etc. that build trust between all of us. That's what it means to be Swiss (or any other nation I would think).   So yes, ""Swissness"" matters, because on top of uniting quite different people around the same goal, it is also what builds mutual respect for our differences.   Fail to respect traditional values, and you'll be like France. Nobody wants that, not even the French funnily (or sadly) enough.   Also, Switzerland can't have more than x million people living on its soil. Let in this pro-immigration, relativist Euro-universalism and you'll destroy the product of many hundreds of years of work in common. And true democracy as well, since Europe is closer to a totalitarian regime than to a democracy."
Switzerland,382q86,Formaggio_svizzero,2,Tue Jun 2 18:18:01 2015 UTC,"The ""mutual respect for our differences"" is interesting, because that's indeed the case between the Cantons (although it doesn't always sound respectful towards AI, but that may be un-swiss harsh joking). The respect towards differences with foreigners seems somewhat absent, even when they went to school here, so presumably had the same history lessons."
Switzerland,382q86,uzapy,0,Tue Jun 2 21:49:28 2015 UTC,"The respect towards foreigners isn't absent. Only brainwashed leftists defend the idea that Switzerland is racist and intolerant and whatever. But for me to point at this would destroy your narrative, so let's ignore reality and entertain what makes you think you're the good guy, huh? ;)"
Switzerland,382q86,Formaggio_svizzero,3,Wed Jun 3 05:52:18 2015 UTC,"I don't consider myself leftist, nor do I have a narrative. As a (dutch) foreigner here for 8 years, I'm just trying to understand Swiss customs/mentality better. I think that the poster that the OP posted, which shows caricatures of the main targeted foreigners cannot be considered respectful and accepting of our differences towards these foreigners, even if the audience knows them to be  caricatures.  FWIW, I think the dutch are somewhat equally foreigner-(un)friendly.  Thanks for your answers in this subthread!"
Switzerland,382q86,Aethec,-1,Wed Jun 3 07:48:38 2015 UTC,"True, but here's the point: being ""respectful and accepting our differences"" is a leftist narrative, and cannot be taken seriously.   I'm not going to respect people who don't respect me (or my country, which is about the same) in the first place. And by respect I mean: keep your religion/culture/customs at home and don't impose them on me. Understand that I don't feel culturally enriched (or otherwise enriched) by your being here.  To be clear, I respect anyone who abides by the rules and culture of my country, be they non-white, muslim, whatever. I'm only hostile towards people who fill our prisons and behave like idiots; I'm actually even more hostile towards the people who defend them (referring to the left-wing clones who get high on multiculturalism).   But that is just my very own opinion, I don't think it's that common in here. Or is it.   Cheers and thank you too for the debate!   EDIT: The Dutch are foreigner-unfriendly? I used to think Holland was like the heaven (or hell, depending on how you look at it) of multiculturalism and cultural relativism."
Switzerland,382q86,Zorthianator,2,Wed Jun 3 16:29:52 2015 UTC,"Well, Wilders should have ruined that reputation with his pro-Israel, very heavy anti-Islam flaming.  I think NL was somewhat multi-cultural (mostly as in: I don't give a shit what you believe or do, just leave me out of it, and don't annoy me). Wilders started complaining about Islam, praising our Christian roots, where almost the whole country spent the last 40 years ignoring and untieing those roots.  That's one thing I wish Switzerland would be somewhat less culturally entrenched in its past: Just buy a watch with an alarm-clock for the few people who don't have one yet, and turn those damned church bells off. Yes, you had them for centuries, we invented something better, start using it."

Switzerland,382q86,picala,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:59:25 2015 UTC,SVP is even worse than UKIP in my opinion when it comes to certain aspects.  They are the people that will blame foreigners for everything bad that happens in Switzerland. Too many cars? Foreigners! Bad weather? Foreigners! My farts stink? Foreigners!!  Unfortunately they have a crazy way of seeing things.
Switzerland,382q86,as-well,-4,Tue Jun 2 07:43:22 2015 UTC,"And yet they correctly identified that the EU would be a threat, and anyone intelligent who hates them otherwise has to admit that they did the entire country a favour with it."
Switzerland,382q86,Chrisixx,2,Tue Jun 2 09:37:26 2015 UTC,"I'm also anti-EU, but I'm certainly not so brain dead to just blame immigrants for everything bad that happens in Switzerland.  Most of their policies are based on fear mongering, racism and hatred."
Switzerland,382q86,idonthaveacoolname13,-4,Tue Jun 2 11:19:29 2015 UTC,"And since most (maybe all) the other parties are too stupid to be eurosceptic, the racism is a price we have to pay.

I also think one has to distinguish on what people vote, what the media writes, what the party says they want and what actually happens.   I think in Switzerland the situation is not worse than in other countries. Although the SVP gets many votes, there is no more extreme party which gets significant votes. Also what the SVP actually does in the end, is not as extreme as what they advertise.   But what goes on in peoples minds, I don't know. But very difficult to say in general."
Switzerland,382fvo,Gimly,3,Mon Jun 1 11:35:16 2015 UTC,"Did you look at the Vaud canton? All the countryside votes UDC around 30%.  We could discuss splitting countryside / towns, since most if not all major cities are PS."

Switzerland,37ycc4,SwissBliss,3,Sun May 31 15:49:02 2015 UTC,Worst year in ages for me. Last year was fine but I think it was because I had anti-histamines.

I have never tried it, since when I started taking something against pollen, the pharmacy recommended claritine-pollen. I have never felt tired with them and they work great for me. One pill in the morning and l am sneeze free the whole day. Btw, I can absolutely recommend an flat with minergie standard and an comfort-air-vent, since they usually have built-in pollen filters."

However, the current level of cereals pollen manages to break, even though just a bit, through this medication barrier.

All the Students have the same costs, so the same criteria should apply for scholarships.  Erbschaftssteuer: I think the state should try to take tax money where it hurts the individuals as little as possible, and I think Inheritance is one of those cases. An Inheritance comes unexpectedly, so a person does not rely on that money. An Inheritance is basically a present. I think it's only fair if some of that money also goes to the state.

In the US the most famous advocates for a high inheritance tax are Bill Gates and Warren Buffet. and the reasoning is everybody has to work for its own success and people don't deserve money just by right of birth. If the FDP was a real ""liberal"" party they would be in favor of this but as usual with this party they only represent big business and rich peoples interests."

Switzerland,37xsbt,futurespice,7,Sun May 31 11:08:06 2015 UTC,ELI5: Liberalism.  Liberalism is a school of thought who wants to give everybody an equal start. after that start everything else is in your power and state should not redistribute wealth because those who were lazy deserve to be poor. Having lots of money by right of birth would not give everybody and equal start so that's why liberal thinkers generally agree on an inheritance tax.   I know this is a theoretical construct and does not transfer directly into reality however with a Freibetrag of 5 millions which is (I hope you agree) a lot of money and won't leave anybody even a little bit poor there's a compromise that is really big enough. They also agreed on making exceptions for KMUs and family businesses so that's also not a valid argument.   The only issue I have with this initiative is the blatant violation of the Rückwirkungsverbot.
Switzerland,37xsbt,weeeaaa,-3,Sun May 31 11:24:47 2015 UTC,Why cant we just be happy for others that they might start of better? The Freibetrag is not 5 mio. The Freibetrag is less and most wealth is in housing. People do not have 5 mio on their bank account. The exceptions for KMUs are vaguely defined. There is not even a number in the initiative. The Freibetrag will be defined after the initiative is accepted. That is basically gambling.
Switzerland,37xsbt,Urgullibl,3,Sun May 31 11:35:17 2015 UTC,The Freibetrag will be set by the parliament which leans right-wing and will make sure there's a big Freibetrag and exceptions for KMU. I doubt there are lots of people who have a five million house and wouldn't be able to pay the taxes.
Switzerland,37xsbt,anonlymouse,1 point,Sun May 31 12:05:59 2015 UTC,"The house may be worth 5 mio, but you have to subtract the loan (generally 80% of the house) to know the inherited value. So in your case the legacy is of 1 million CHF own funds and 4 million CHF loan."

Switzerland,37xsbt,yesat,2,Sun May 31 12:37:53 2015 UTC,The current system is called Föderalismus. Each canton can independently decide whom they give Stipendien.
Switzerland,37xsbt,anonlymouse,3,Sun May 31 12:47:47 2015 UTC,I know that and this system makes sense in many cases but not in all cases. for example I still get why we need so many different school systems and in some cantons it takes 2 years longer to get a matura than in others. Same with Stipendien. 26 people that have the same financial background from 26 different cantons can all study at ETH but some might get stipendien some might not. It just doesn't make sense.

Switzerland,37xsbt,Kadrik,2,Sun May 31 10:04:27 2015 UTC,"I'm voting the same, but let me add some thoughts..   PID: If you ask people ""do you want to genetically engineer children?"" the answer will most of the time be ""no"". So the question that is relevant in this discussion is ""where do you draw the line?"". Many people who will vote ""no"" do so to nip this in the bud ( ""Wehret den Anfängen"" ), similar to the ""Gentech-Moratorium"" which forbids any research or production concerning genetically altered food. Personally I think that at least analyzing your unborn children will be the future, and standing in the way of progress has never helped anybody.   Inheritance: What angers me the most with this initiative are a) that they include everything back to 2012 (violates the constitution, it's not even certain if this is legal) and b) they have been changing the numbers for family businesses time and time again. Unformulated initiatives have time and time again proven themselves to be incredibly frustrating because the ever so important details need to be passed by both chambers of parliament. Just think of the recent examples (Zweitwohnung, Masseneinwanderung, Marche Blanche) and how everyone is everyone from left to right is yelling ""This is unreasonable! This violates the spirit of the initiative!"" to any proposition. Well fuck you, how about you present the details for the people to vote on with the initiative. Too afraid it might not pass? That means it's probably shit to begin with, so save everyone the headache just to pat yourselves on the back for being ""close to the people"" and do it right or not at all.  /rant  Stipends: I think that if the cantons have to deal with the universities, they should also be the ones dealing with the stipends. Living in a canton with low taxes (like Schwyz) means you get low public service (like stipends) so take the money you are not giving society and support your offspring, don't burden it upon the state.   Billag: I accept this mostly so people finally shut the fuck up about this. Almost everyone has a device on which they can watch TV (including laptops and smartphones and public viewings during the world cup), and if you are one of the very special snowflakes who has nothing at all then congratulations, you are now taking one for the team. Go you! Maybe the next time you use one of the many perfectly maintained hiking trails in the mountains or go to the playground with your kids you'll think of all the people who never use either of those things yet pay for it with their tax money.

Ah, the old ""everybody who works hard becomes rich"" trope. It's almost as if...   For me this initiative is nothing more than stealing, just because it would affect 2% of the population doesn't make it right. Nothing good can come out of this.   ...you were a typical Reddit libertarian who thinks taxes are theft and poor people are just lazy."
Switzerland,37xsbt,010101000101,-2,Sun May 31 14:10:34 2015 UTC,"Many policies everybody is used to nowadays were very much left-wing at the time. Paid holidays, paid sick days, mandatory health insurance, parental leave, etc   I don't know why you are making this a left vs right argument, I try to evaluate every initiative irrespective of where it came from and I happen to be in favor of all the policies you stated above.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not against taxation but in this case we are talking about money that was already taxed a first time upon acquisition and a second time with wealth taxation, do we really want to tax it a third time ? This seems very unfair to me and will most certainly drive people away, I know it would drive me away if I was concerned.  Smart people will manage to avoid this taxation, either by leaving or by exploiting a loophole, in fine rendering this taxation useless with a negative impact overall.   If you support this initiative so strongly what is your argument in favor of it? are you supporting it just because it comes from the left-wing ?"
Switzerland,37xsbt,Kadrik,1 point,Sun May 31 15:17:11 2015 UTC,"As I said in my original post, I'm not necessarily in favor of the initiative, but the argument that this stuff will crush the economy/make the rich leave/kill small businesses/... is useless.  The main argument for this initiative IMHO is leveling the playing field. Inheritance is money you get without having done anything - just because you were born in the right family. Taxing it means reducing the advantage some people have."
Switzerland,37xsbt,Aethec,-1,Sun May 31 15:53:57 2015 UTC,"Explain to me how it makes a difference in regards to leveling the playing field if someone now inherits 8 instead of 10 million? This argument is just pure left wing populism that targets the jealous and those that long for some kind of absolute justice. Let's at least be honest here. The left wing as usual wants more funds funneled into various state programs and the rich people have the money. So the initiative is about taking that money from them, plain and simple.  I personally am against it because I think the initiative is very badly constructed. Tax everybody 5%, put those funds into AHV and call it a day. That would be a much better and simpler solution in my opinion."
Switzerland,37xsbt,Aethec,3,Sun May 31 16:35:33 2015 UTC,"So the initiative is about taking that money from them, plain and simple.   Well, yeah, that's the entire purpose of taxes. The question is not whether we should tax, since government needs them to work, it's what taxes to have.   Tax everybody 5%, put those funds into AHV and call it a day.   Taxing people who have very little money means they get even poorer, which is pointless, and you get very little money.  Taxing people who have a lot of money doesn't affect them much, and you get a lot of money. People don't get rich in a vacuum: if the government didn't provide basic services such as law, the police, the firefighters, public roads, etc. you wouldn't get rich. Elizabeth Warren said it better than I can."
Switzerland,37xsbt,Chrisixx,1 point,Sun May 31 18:00:58 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, that's the entire purpose of taxes. The question is not whether we should tax, since government needs them to work, it's what taxes to have.   Of course we need to tax. The question I was raising was about how much we tax, for what purpose we tax and from whom we take the money from.   Taxing people who have very little money means they get even poorer, which is pointless, and you get very little money.   Remember, we are talking about inheritance tax. Also, I'm pretty sure that 5% of each inheritance is more than 20% of the few that are left over after a hundred special exceptions are applied. It's also simply more fair.   People don't get rich in a vacuum: if the government didn't provide basic services such as law [...]   I've heard that argument a lot and of course it is true. I fail to see the relevance here however. We are not talking about whether or not people should contribute to society by paying taxes. Nobody is questioning that. Everybody does pay taxes already. And with progression, a lot actually. We are talking about the introduction of a new tax and whether or not it is necessary, just and well implemented."
Switzerland,37xsbt,ProstateDeGorille,2,Sun May 31 20:50:48 2015 UTC,"It's also simply more fair.   Taking an equal percentage from everyone isn't fair. If you take 5% of what a poor person has, that makes them even poorer. If you take 5% of what a very rich person has, they'll be slightly less rich. That's why we have progressive taxes: because the more money you have, the larger proportion of it you can afford to give away.  Remember that the point of taxes is to pay for government services, and the point of these services is to help people. Taking money from people who don't have much and using that money to fund a very tiny fraction of government services is less efficient than simply not taking their money.   We are talking about the introduction of a new tax and whether or not it is necessary, just and well implemented.   These criteria are good, but they are relative, not absolute. The question is, do we have a better alternative? The Federal Council agrees that social security is under-funded, and their proposal is to raise VAT by 1.5% to fund it. VAT is the exact opposite of a progressive tax: the more money you have, the less you care about it. I do think that an inheritance tax is better than this alternative."
Switzerland,37xsbt,lmperator,0,Sun May 31 21:20:34 2015 UTC,"You say that this argument is ""useless"" yet you fail to explain why. Don't you think people would manage to avoid this taxation?  Now we come to the real reason this initiative was introduced, which is leveling the playing field and has nothing to do with AHV/AVS, this is based on jealousy. This is short sighted thinking, sure it will level the playing field but on the long term everyone will be poorer on average.   It is not up to you and me to decide if someone deserves what he inherits, it's up to his parents, it's their wealth, it has already been taxed, they decide what what will become of it. I believe that's where we disagree on principle, I understand what you say but I wholeheartedly disagree. Farewell stranger!"
Switzerland,37xsbt,Kadrik,1 point,Sun May 31 16:33:01 2015 UTC,"You say that this argument is ""useless"" yet you fail to explain why.   Because it's used every single time there's a proposal for a new tax/regulation, but when said tax/regulation passes, (most of the time) nothing truly bad happens. It's the political version of the boy who cried wolf.   It is not up to you and me to decide if someone deserves what he inherits, it's up to his parents, it's their wealth, it has already been taxed, they decide what what will become of it.   The state intervenes in many decisions concerning wealth already. If a parent wants to cut off support for their child for no reason, for instance, the state says no, you can't do that, it's not your decision."

Switzerland,37y7e9,Ordnungsbusse,4,Tue Jun 2 08:42:34 2015 UTC,"a little theoritical insight,  on the recruitment, you'll have psychological tests (in front of a computer, and depending on your answers, with a psy.) you will then have a visit with a doctor.   about your back problems, taking certificates and radiographies might help your case.  about the way things work :  if you are considered fit for the military and don't want to do it : you'll have the possibility to do civil service (it might change in the future, some controversies and recent news on the subject).  if you are unable (inapte in french) to go to the army you'll have to go to the civil protection (means : serving a few days each years, and paying a bit of tax).  and finally if you are considered unable to do the civil protection you will have to pay (and only that). but to be unable to do the civil protection, you have to be totally fucked up (either mentally or physically): i mean : being in a rollchair, having very strong psychological deseases (like loads of violence/very severe anxiety and stuff) which are almost impossible to fake (they have trained professional psys to check that).  Being addicted to drugs propably won't save you from the civil protection (and may even not be a reason to miss the army (case dependent i suppose)).  You choose whatever you want to do in this recruitment, as stated by others, lying to avoid your duties because you see no interest in the thing is actually going against the system that whishes the participation of every citizen in the public life and defense.  Why I chose to go to the army and why you could choose to do the same.   it's not obligatory 1 year straight, you can spend 4 month and then 3 weeks during 6 years: two advantages :  you get 4 month of ""fun"" (creating friendships with people you would probably have never met before; doing incredible stuff (depending on the position) you wouldn't do anywere else).  And then, you get to have 3 weeks more out of your job(3 weeks ""holidays"" more ), where you meet these same friends again (or others but you'll get by) and have a chance to share drinks fairly often (or maby it's just for the ""romands"" ;) ).  You have a chance to get skills you would strugle (have to pay a lot of money) to find elswere.  fancy driving a motorrad, a truck, a boat? certains positions will teachyou to drive special vehicles (with licences valid in the civil), and learning to drive will probably spare you quite a bit of time out of the mud.  Want to do certain professions? the army might help (firefighter, policeman, border control, horses related weird posts...)  Want to become a manager, to have a leading position, to gain experience? if you're smart, and willfull, the army will be glad to provide you with teaching and experience (it's fairly well paid (and you'll have to stay longer too) and you have quite a lot of responsability and experience to show in the end.  On the monetary side, if you are still studying, 4 month in the army means quite a bit of money on side to start.  why not the other options :  civil service : quite hard to find interesting stuff to do, longer than the military. civil protection : you'll end up with people that were considered too crasy to go to the army, lasy folks and weird peoples that could make you have the worse time of your life (or not, loads of nice people too). Depending on your position : it may suck to have only 2-3 days every now and then in the year and not a fix amount to serve.   Good Luck in your choice !"
Switzerland,37y7e9,Ordnungsbusse,9,Sun May 31 20:55:30 2015 UTC,"As a preface I must say - even though that might be a minority opinion by now (?) - that I just can't stand this kind of ""cheating behaviour"" to avoid your service duty. I assume that you're most likely more than able to fulfill some kind of job in the army considering many of them are not even really physically demanding. If you don't want to do it - that's fine but why don't you just choose the civil option instead?  That being said, military doctors are still obliged to respect the medical secret. There are some exceptions made by military law but drug consumption isn't one of them until they fear that you can't be trusted with a weapon [Art. 113 Abs. 2 Militärgesetz]. There is no to minimal risk in discussing your drug habits or addictions (?) with the doctors there and it is more than likely to have a negative (or positive from your POV) on your personal assessement.  In the end it all comes down to how you sell it to them. Drug consumption can even be disregarded from my experience when you're not addicted and it therefore doens't affect your life in an extreme way and you still convey the will to serve. Probably not what you want to do though."

However, let me make one point in favour of military service in Switzerland. For me as an academic, my time in the army has been invaluable to me. Why you may aks?  Because it has provided me with the rare opportunity to meet people from all walks of life and classes and spend time togehter under the same not very comfortable conditions.  As much as I would like to believe otherwise: Prejudice and closed-mindedness are widespread problems among the Swiss (or humanity as a whole) and most of us are affected in one way or the other even though we might not know it. The time in the army has a healing effect - at least it has had for me and I tried hard to prove others that - contrary to their stubborn believes - students actually know how to work with their hands. ;-)"

As an avid men's rights defendant, my opinion is that as long as he's being forced to do work only because he has a penis, he's morally justified in using most means necessary to avoid doing it. It is unfair to others conscripted, this, however, is being negated by the overarching issue already being unfair to them and, secondly, cannot possibly be his problem to deal with.

Switzerland,37y7e9,Ordnungsbusse,5,Sun May 31 12:48:09 2015 UTC,"You may or may not believe it but I have read many pages and verdicts on the subject and I wholeheartedly agree: Service duty just for men is injust and unwarranted in the light of the constitutional Art. 8 Abs. 3 and it really makes me angry that this issue is not on the political agenda at all.  I respect and understand your opinion if it really is your primary motivation an not just a seemingly reasonable cause to avoid your duty. However, for myself and as a principle, I still beg to differ. Injustice can not be fought by injustice and if one itends to take on the system he can do so by the available legal means."
Switzerland,37y7e9,ALTSuzzxingcoh,1 point,Sun May 31 13:08:11 2015 UTC,"Well, he doesn't really ""be"" injust towards someone through his own avoidance, does he?

He does what's right for him and if there then exists a legal difference between one person that doesn't have to serve and the mass that does, well, too bad. The ""legal"" means involve getting thousands of people to sign a paper, waiting a few months or years and hoping for the approval of several dozens of politicans - since it's a change in the constitution - who'd rather eat themselves than make men legally equal to women."
Switzerland,37y7e9,Ordnungsbusse,3,Sun May 31 13:15:21 2015 UTC,"I would argue that your analogy is flawed beacause ""sneaking off"" is not a forbidden action while not truthfully answer the questions reagarding your service duty clearly is. This is obviously not the case for OP, since he has real problems with drugs and his health and their disclosure is therefore already justfied by the law and does not provide a need for some kind of constructed ""self-defence-right"" regarding the injustice between the genders which I thought we were discussing. :-/  You seem to make the point that the end justifies the means in this particular case and I really can understand that.

But in last weeks Arena, Widmer Schlumpf asked them questions about a number of issues and I got the impression that they hadn't event thought about them before.  If the proposed tax was 5% for everyone, I think I could get behind it. But this 20% thing riddled with exceptions and special rules just seems weird to me.

Furthermore taxing old people's money is the most logical way of paying AVS and redistribute money from the richest of them to the poorest of them. Knowing life expectancy in the country, taxing inheritance is exactly doing that."

Switzerland,37qlvq,theindigamer,7,Fri May 29 16:45:56 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I didn't even know about this.  EDIT: done editing for now, this is all I could find.  Coop:   Coop has a list here. The text also mentions that ""in general"" all soft cheeses do not use rennet at all, while hard cheeses do. All fresh cheeses they sell (quark, cottage-cheese, etc.) do not use rennet at all (whether animal or microbial). They also all do not contain gelatine.   Migros:   Migros has made a list available here (original thread here), with a list of all products without animal rennet. All fresh-cheeses (cottage-cheese, etc) from ELSA do not contain rennet at all. All quark products do not contain animal rennet (no info on microbial rennet). BUT: The quark desserts may contain gelatine (check the label). The mozarellas from Alfredo, Santa Lucia, Galbani, Leger, M-Budget, Migros-Bio contain microbial (non-animal) rennet. BUT: The Mozarella di Bufala is an exception that contains animal rennet. Kiri, Babybel, Cantadou contain microbial (non-animal) rennet. M-Classic Salatkäse, Bio Feta, Selection Feta contain microbial (non-animal) rennet. BUT: Feta Xenia, Xetabel contain animal rennet.   Lidl:   List here Note that the list contains cheeses where both is possible. ""Tierisch"" means animal, ""Beides möglich"" means both animal and microbial is possible   Aldi:   List here   Other sites:   More cheeses here. More links (mostly the same as above) here   Some notes:   I'm slightly confused by the Babybel soft cheeses. Coop says they don't contain rennet at all, whereas Migros says they contain microbial rennet. It seems that Migros is right, as Babybel themselves say that Mini Babybel, Mini Babybel ""Light"" und Mini Babybel ""Emmentaler Art"" contain microbial rennet, while the green Mini Babybel (Mozarella) is not suitable for vegetarians (probably because it contains animal rennet). You might want to buy more German/EU cheese instead of Swiss cheese, as our neighbors seem to have more products without animal rennet and they sometimes have a green ""V"" printed on the label for vegetarian products."

Switzerland,37l4up,SatoyS,1 point,Thu May 28 21:45:06 2015 UTC,"Oh I've found it, thanks for the link:    Kurzfristig ist die Situation folgende: Wir sind vertraglich verpflichtet, Traffic Richtung Deutsche Telekom und France Telekom nicht via Telia zu routen, d.h. die Latenz wird ca. 70ms höher sein als bei einem Routing via Europa. XO hat aber, wie bereits oben erwähnt, auch nicht genügend Kapazität zur Deutschen Telekom, was in teilweise massivem Packet-Loss, insbesondere in der Prime-Time zwischen 18 und 23 Uhr resultiert. Die Latenz in die Netze von Deutsche Telekom und France Telecom wird vorderhand + ca. 70ms aufweisen. Mittlerweile haben wir einen Workaround implementiert, der allerdings kostenpflichtig sein wird.     So it seems like the Deutsche Telekom is the main issue, other providers seem to be more cooperative. Although reading this page makes me sick, no wonder routing is often fucked up, independent of the ISP."

First of all, the bloody border conflicts in Eritrea are a direct result of the way the land was divided after WWII. But, that is just one instance in the region's long history of getting screwed over by European countries and that legacy of European/Western interference has continued up until the modern era. They have a history of guys with mysterious financial backing coming in, enlisting all the able bodied men, and forcing them to fight over resources that they'll never see. There's just no resisting that kind of power. Now, this may be debatable, but I believe that the Swiss should feel a little bit of sympathy for refugees from African conflicts considering how much the banks in this country have profited from them. The economic prosperity in Switzerland has unfortunately been partially at the expense of impoverished Africans. So if you feel so strongly that these guys should develop their own country, you should do what you can to prevent the Swiss banking industry from screwing them over all the time instead of passively whining about it."

I understand that their country isn't going well at all. But if you keep escaping when stuff go wrong, you never learn to adapt and get better. Same goes for them.   Europe didn't construct itself over a night. It took time and effort over centuries to get to the level we've today. And why is it so? Because people fought for their land, their families, their country/kingdom. They didn't escaped to another place where it was easier.  I don't understand the mentality of ""give to the others but not to our people"". There are plenty of swiss born people struggling every month to feed their child, pay a rent, etc, but we (our authorities) keep giving millions of CHF to migrant.   And if you come about people using African as slave, meatshield or whatever, why should I feel ashamed about it? It's not my problem, as I'm definitely not involved into this. And to be honnest, when the Europeans went to Africa 3 or 4 centuries ago, africans hadn't discovered how to forge metal, they were living like we did at stone age. So we gave them tool, we explained them a lot, improved their life a lot compared to what they had."

Switzerland,37icuh,Lejeune_Dirichelet,1 point,Thu May 28 13:49:56 2015 UTC,Of course some did. But it wasn't the main issue at this time. Most people living between 1600-1850 were looking for a new life and  owning some land.

Most people leaving for the new world went here either for opportunities to start up a new life, because there was chance to be able to claim land. They weren't running away due to a war, and they weren't running away because they were lazy, as the new land didn't had anything established."

Switzerland,37icuh,unCoreMeltdown,5,Thu May 28 12:58:59 2015 UTC,"They don't in all cases come to Europe - quite the opposite. There are something like 2 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon alone right now. That's almost 50% of the country's natural population.  The vast majority of refugees are stuck in slum camps in countries next door to the one they left, hoping they'll be able to return home soon. Actually, the vast majority of refugees never even leave their country - there are something like twice as many internally displaced peoples than there are refugees that have been forced to cross an international border in search of safety.  Why do you think Europe shouldn't take on a portion of the burden of international asylum? Because you think some other countries aren't pulling their weight in taking refugees? How is that anything but an argument for encouraging those countries to change their policies?  Do you think hopeless refugee camp communities living in poverty and degradation you've never even imagined is an acceptable thing? Or a good thing for the wider world even? Do you need to hear a more selfish motivation? Does it occur to you that such places are the birthplaces of bitter extremism that has far-ranging repercussions you might want to concern yourself with?  It took seeing the horrors of the Second World War to get us an international agreement that recognised any individual's right to asylum from harm, but people are so removed now from how bad the world can be they're arguing to throw that away because they think there are a few too many new people in their territory."

And who's at war with Bachar? ISIS & their allies.   If you watch Libya, it's also the ISIS who's there, and slowly sending people over Europe.   Why do you think many extra-european countries doesn't allow immigration? Australia, China, Japan, Russia, Israel,... to name a few of them. Everything is for Europe. Because Europe messed up, now it's up to them to clean the mess. (It's a bit short, but it's exactly what it means). But do you really know why the all come to Europe? because once they're here, we don't send them back. We give them a home, food, money without them giving anything back, nor respecting our traditions, religions and culture.  Do you really think if the situation was reversed, UE was at war and you'll go away and move to another country in Africa or Mid-East, they would allow you to come? To build your church, import your food, and make your life like it's with your culture?"
Switzerland,37icuh,unCoreMeltdown,2,Thu May 28 13:29:50 2015 UTC,The Syrian conflict is much more complex than you think. People running out of Syria are people who don't want to die.

Switzerland,37icuh,telllos,1 point,Thu May 28 15:49:49 2015 UTC,"most of rebel factions are now fighting with ISIS. I understand they don't want to die, who would want to die other than some emo?  But why don't the go to Iran, or dubai, etc? It's country with the same religion, somewhat the same culture, climate etc. No they need to come here. Why that? Because the country I mentionned above don't want them as there is a too high risk that they're affiliated with ISIS"

Do you really think if the situation was reversed, UE was at war and you'll go away and move to another country in Africa or Mid-East, they would allow you to come?    Maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't, I don't know to be honest. Either way, why do you seem to think we should be measuring ourselves against the ethical standards of cultures you clearly find beneath you?

I don't see any of them.   Have you looked? Switzerland denies full refugee status to something like 70% of asylum applications they receive, maybe more I think. They get sent back on trains and planes after we give their cases a fair hearing, because we live in a civilised country that cares about fundamental human rights.   The issue is that immigration make source country weaker, and target country weaker.   Firstly, this isn't about immigration, it's about asylum. Those are completely separate issues. Learn the difference.  Secondly, the idea that immigration makes the ""target country"" weaker is a massively unsubstantiated claim. Immigrants have historically delivered massive net benefits to western European countries."
Switzerland,37icuh,busstopboxer,2,Thu May 28 14:48:46 2015 UTC,"But, you are involved in this more than you think.   In the 80s, before Eritrea's independence, $315 million was deposited into Swiss bank accounts with HSBC. No one knows how much could have been deposited in UBS or Credit Suisse accounts. Back then $315 million would have been something like 4 or 5 years worth of GDP. The only people who could have possibly amassed this much money were the rulers of the country. In the following 15-20 years of conflict another $400 million would be deposited into HSBC. Again, several years worth of their GDP.   These people are being heavily exploited. How can they build anything up when such a huge amount of their resources end up in Swiss bank accounts?"
Switzerland,37icuh,YeaISeddit,1 point,Thu May 28 12:52:13 2015 UTC,"Back then $315 million would have been something like 4 or 5 years worth of GDP.   I can only find inflation adjusted figures and they give 1980 GDP of eritrea as ~2.8 billion USD and 1989 GDP as ~5.6 billion.  Now 314 mil. in 1980 dollars is roughly 900 mil. today - I don't think it's 3 or 4 years of GDP but rather about a third of a year. It is for sure a big sum compared to GDP.    And it is also a completely unconfirmed sum - not that I want to suggest that there is no eritrean black money in swiss banks, just that this sum is dubious."
Switzerland,37icuh,futurespice,1 point,Thu May 28 14:58:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not at my computer anymore, but when I Googled the GDP I got something closer to 100 million. As for the Eritrean money, I think the HSBC Swiss Leaks scandal looks to be pretty much confirmed."
Switzerland,37icuh,YeaISeddit,1 point,Thu May 28 15:34:58 2015 UTC,"the Swiss leaks articles about eritrean money are all second-hand reporting and not everyone marked as ""eritrean"" is actually eritrean, meaning that in many cases it is not 100% clear who owned the monex and what country it actually came from.   Which, again, is not to say there is no corruption in eritrea and no black money from there in Swiss banks or indeed in HSBC. Just mens it's not imediately staightforward to estimate.  EDIT: man were those figures wrong. sorry. GDP of Eritrea in the '80s is not existing anyway as they were not an independant country. So any capital inflow during that was, I guess, Ethiopian. At independance ca. 600M GDP.   But in general there is no way one person accumulated 3 years worth of GDP in black money over a decade, this sounds completely implausible even for somewhere very corrupt. The African Union estimates 25% GDP loss to corruption so  even it was a bit more in war-torn eritrea this would mean that pretty much all bribes end up in one hand - no way...."

I don't trust the media because they aren't impartial at all. They are just a muppet, hold be governement.   You'll maybe call me a complotist, or whatever, it's up to you.

The government gets a huge percentage of its money from corporate taxes. Even if the government doesn't see all the money, do you realize how much it helps the economy for a bank to have $700 million floating around? That allows you to buy a house at a low interest rate, it allows the local businesses to get loans to make payroll, that allows venture capitalists to support start up companies. You benefit from all that reinvestment."
Switzerland,37icuh,YeaISeddit,0,Thu May 28 13:51:22 2015 UTC,"Now, this may be debatable, but I believe that the Swiss should feel a little bit of sympathy for refugees from African conflicts considering how much the banks in this country have profited from them. The economic prosperity in Switzerland has unfortunately been partially at the expense of impoverished Africans.    This sounds rather interesting, do you have any pointers for me where I can read more about this (how swiss banks profited from africa etc)? I so far am unfortunately only aware of the questionable stuff the IMF does.  Also: I think that we should have empathy & sympathy for others purely for the reason that they too are humans.

Many, like Thurgau and Tessin, only gained this after the napoleonic intervention in 1813. The case of Basel-Landschaft might just be an exception to ease some of the hurt pride for not being counted as a full Kanton. (Edit: Kantons to Territories)"
Switzerland,37huj2,suethes,1 point,Thu May 28 14:46:05 2015 UTC,"That had the OP confused because Jura was counted in that way, the half-cantons however were not. Also, many of the cantons were basically introduced by the Helvetic Republic in 1798 (read: by Napoleon), wher there might have been a formal local government deciding to join the union. Yet it was basically decided by someone else (read: Napoleons people). That is why I say it was quite whacky because the territory of Thurgau, for example, was a part of Switzerland before that, but a common territory."

Switzerland,37huj2,LethalPuppy,2,Wed May 27 22:18:08 2015 UTC,"Basel was once one canton and only split 1833. Therefore they technically both joined in 1833 because Canton ""Basel ceased"" to exist, and Canton ""Basel Stadt"" and ""Basel Land"" were created.  OP has a point..."
Switzerland,37huj2,hubraum,2,Thu May 28 00:47:23 2015 UTC,You could say that Bern ceased to exist and became Bern and Jura.   Also different because Basel and Appenzell are both split into half cantons while Bern and Jura are both full.

The next time we shouldn't tax corporations or inheritances or shouldn't extend billag to the elite, maybe think about how little they do for us, how unwilling they are to cooperate. Nobody voluntarily crosses half a country every day; there's a reason we have to. Remember ""Der Kluge fährt mit dem Zuge""? That's what you get for pan-european economic ""mobility""."
Switzerland,37inye,ALTSuzzxingcoh,2,Thu May 28 04:01:51 2015 UTC,This rambling and completely idiotic stammtischtirade misses the issue of the debate completely. I can just hear the Swissness oozing out of you. Your kind of fucked up sentiment is why I always pretend to not be from Switzerland when I meet a Swiss person abroad - most of us are just insufferable cunts I want nothing to do with.
Switzerland,37inye,get_some_perspective,-3,Thu May 28 07:55:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know, I offended the upper class, classic Buenzli. We can happily discuss possible ""realistic"" alternatives, such as ""monetary incentives"" for office workers to find a shit-paying job in their own town, yo-yo-ing between supporting all the public transport equally, expressing our view that car owners pay infinitesimally more than train passengers and in return demanding that costs be more equally shared, which, of course, isn't possible, because a freaking locomotive is a lot more difficult to move than a 1.5-ton car and we frankly depend on unproportionally expensive trains to keep the country going. We can keep discussing how to elegantly stretch space around Zürich and Bern, how we want to have skyscrapers, expensive subways and layered freeways, while also preserving the traditional panoramic scenery. We can expand on how ""difficult"" it is for companies to do away with managing people like cattle in our modern globalized world, how it's easier to put this burden upon the common man. In the end, the income equality will rise, the companies won't be touched without gloved hands and the train stations still won't have any more platforms."

Switzerland,37gip4,swiss_questions,24,Wed May 27 13:39:49 2015 UTC,Always safe to drink unless there is a sign that says it isn't. It's basically tap water. Water is not recycled when it's safe to drink. The bars are for the bucket to put on. When there wasn't plumbing people had buckets to get fresh water from the fountain.
Switzerland,37gip4,P1r4nha,13,Wed May 27 14:37:11 2015 UTC,"In Zurich at any rate, the public fountains not only dispense water that is safe to drink (unless a sign says otherwise); they also each have their own individual water supply, so in case of damage to the public water system, everyone would still have fresh water around the corner."
Switzerland,37gip4,CroceaMors,2,Wed May 27 17:01:56 2015 UTC,"Wait, how does that work?  EDIT: Found it. See my comment here."
Switzerland,37gip4,_droptable_,4,Fri May 29 17:40:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, they were commonly used as public water source and for laundry. You'll sometimes see fountains with two basins one after another, so one could be used for washing and one for rinsing."
Switzerland,37gip4,hopsafoobar,3,Wed May 27 14:01:24 2015 UTC,I thought the second one was for horses.
Switzerland,37gip4,backgammon_no,4,Wed May 27 19:08:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's how clean water was distributed to a town before in-home plumbing became a widespread thing.   There should actually be a small plaque on most fountains that says whether the water is safe to drink. In the ones that are safe to drink from, the water is not recycled from the basin. I showed an American friend around my city once, he was very skeptical that they were safe to drink from, understandably since that's not a thing in America. Of course water fountains exist in America, they just look very different and are rarely on the street.  Not really sure of the historical purpose of the iron bars. As far as I'm concerned, they're an effective way of supporting myself with my hands as I reach for the stream of water."
Switzerland,37gip4,StuffedWithNails,2,Wed May 27 14:09:49 2015 UTC,"It's the other way around. Fountains are always safe to drink from in all of Switzerland unless there explicitely is a sign that says ""Kein Trinkwasser""."
Switzerland,37gip4,_droptable_,2,Fri May 29 17:42:08 2015 UTC,In Geneva there are actually many small fountains for which you push a button to get water... they all have a sign indicating the water is drinkable.
Switzerland,37gip4,booksworm,1 point,Sat May 30 14:02:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, but in smaller towns they don't bother putting signs that says that they're drinkable but always do if it's not.  So, as a rule of thumbs, no sign == drinkable water."
Switzerland,37gip4,Gimly,2,Mon Jun 1 12:19:55 2015 UTC,"Fountains in all of Switzerland always have safe water to drink from unless there is a sign that says ""Kein Trinkwasser"". Such signs are mostly found in the countryside or in the forest.  For Zürich: Some of the fountains (including all the ones in the inner city, all historical ones, and 320 of the 1200 regular ones in the greater city) are fed from a separate spring source 150 km away network of spring water pipes 150 km in length. This is to provide safe water for the city in case the regular tap water is contaminated. The rest of the fountains use regular tap water, which consists of 70% lake water (filtered/processed), 15% spring water, 15% ground water.  So actually the water coming out of some of the fountains might even be better than tap water!  Source:   Rund 320 der 1200 Brunnen der Stadt Zürich, die meisten historische Altstadtbrunnen, sowie die über 80 Notwasserbrunnen, werden über ein separates Quellwassernetz von 150 Kilometer Länge gespiesen. Das Wasser stammt zum grössten Teil aus Quellfassungen, welche seit dem 15. Jahrhundert in den Hügeln rund um Zürich erstellt wurden.  Das separate Quellwassernetz hat eine wichtige Bedeutung für die Notwasserversorgung der Stadt Zürich.  Die übrigen Brunnen sind am normalen Verteilnetz der Wasserversorgung angeschlossen und werden – wie die Haushaltungen – mit einer Mischung aus 70 Prozent Seewasser, 15 Prozent Quellwasser und 15 Prozent Grundwasser beliefert."
Switzerland,37gip4,_droptable_,2,Fri May 29 17:53:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for confirming that! The correct translation of ""Quellwassernetz von 150 Kilometer Länge"" is ""a separate network of spring water pipes 150 km in length"". The water sources are not 150 km away.

Switzerland,37a2rw,adamggg,5,Tue May 26 02:28:40 2015 UTC,"These are some of my favorite routes:   Glacier Express This is what you want! A bit long though, even if you don't do all of it. (I usually don't. From Zurich I drive to Chur, board the train, leave it at Brig and head home to Zurich). Goldenpass Express Lucerne? Check. Bernese Oberland? Check. Montreux? Check. Also a bit long, but also very cool. Only disadvantage: You have to change trains quite often (five or six times). But worth it. (From Montreux go back to Zurich via Lausanne) Ticino! Just drive to Lugano or Locarno and back. You'll cross the Alps (well, you'll drive beneath them). So you will see mountains all day long. But it's also an interesting trip because the Gotthard line is a technological marvel. Also: You'll end up in Ticino, which is culturally a different part of Switzerland. Ticino again! Go to Locarno and take the Centovalli Railway which looks like a tram and has written FART on it. You'll laugh, but soon you'll be speachless because of the scenery. The train will take you to Domodossola, Italy where you can take a train to Brig and from there one to Zurich. Yeah, for a short time you'll be in Italy. No problem though, the ticket you buy in Zurich (or the day pass) is valid here.  Appenzell. If this all is a bit to long for you or you want a more relaxed alternative: Take a train to Gossau. Board the tiny train of the Appenzeller Bahnen. In it you have a beautiful view of the Alps. Get out in Appenzell which is cute and small, buy some cheese and beer. Then go back to the station, take another train to St. Gallen. There you should eat a Bratwurst (just don't order mustard). Bonus tip: Trains are nice to travel. But don't forget about boats! Best place for a boat trip is IMO Lake Lucerne (Lake Zurich is nice. But you don't want nice. You want a spectacular view!). So drive to Lucerne and board the boat that makes the whole trip to Flüelen. There you take the train and you'll be back in Zurich one hour later. But I know people who just stayed on the boat and headed back to Lucerne on it. This site has all the information. If you're into steam boats, do some research, you might be able to do the trip on one of them.   Hope that helps. It has been said before: sbb.ch is essential for any planing."

Die Banken haben offenbar wenig Interesse, die betroffenen Kunden zu suchen. Zumal viele von ihnen gar kein Konto mehr in der Schweiz haben.

Switzerland,378zeu,RevolutionOfTheAatma,4,Mon May 25 21:15:10 2015 UTC,"Switzerland has 3 dominant cultures (German speaking, French speaking, Italian speaking) and 26 subcultures (cantons). In a perfect world you'd visit each canton, but that's impossible in 4 days. So I'd recommend you plan it around 3 main cities and then base your activities around them. Geneva for the french speaking side, Zurich for the german speaking, and Lugano for the italian speaking. The good thing about Switzerland is that if you drive/take the train between 2 major cities, you'll see a lot. Between Geneva and Zurich is Lausanne, Montreux, Berne, Basel, etc...  In terms of natural beauty, there's A LOT so it's hard to recommend only a few, and also Canada is quite similar in terms of nature as Switzerland, but here are a few I can think of right now::   Zermatt and the Matterhorn is the most famous and breathtaking. Lauterbrunnen. Where Lord of the Rings was inspired from. Verzasca River in Ticino. Amazingly clear river with divers Jura Mountains. I'm a little biased since this is where I come from mainly. Basically it's the mountain range that gave the name to the Jurassic Period (and Jurassic Park :)). It's a mountain range that is low enough to be almost completely covered in forest and pastures, as opposed to the Alps. If you're near Geneva, I recommend going up to La Dole if you have a car, and eat/drink at the Chalet there, and then hike up to the Ball on the mountain (google a picture), which takes about half an hour each way and is fairly easy. If you don't have a car, take the train to St. Cergue and you can enjoy the small town (eat at Rando Burger, best burgers in Switzerland), and enjoy hiking/camping in the endless forests and pastures up there.  Sanetsch. Not much to it, it's just a passageway between two cantons in the Alps, but it's breathtaking up there.   Thing is that because of the location and natural shape of Switzerland, the climate changes quite radically in a short amount of time. In Geneva and Vaud it's very green and pretty humid due to the lake and mountains, in Valais (where Zermatt is) it's quite dry and warm with Vineyards everywhere, in Ticino (where Lugano is) it's hot enough for palm trees.

So you also get things like holding nazi gold, selling weapons to anyone (though not WMD), and harboring dictators (or at least their money). Let's just say their hands are less than perfectly clean.  The Swiss are not a warm people. Do not expect to be welcomed, especially as the anti-immigration politics continue to gain momentum.    If you are looking for a perfect country, you can put your atlas away now. It doesn't exist.

The afghanistan war, unsurprisingly, was at 93% approval at one time.  I'd wish people would just always quote some data, whether it's very good or not, when doing quantitative statements - if it's bad data, then at least it can be corrected and become the start of a civilised discussion instead of mindless drivel."

Switzerland,37aln7,DeepDuh,8,Tue May 26 23:17:40 2015 UTC,"Lots of negativity here. I'm seeing this a bit differently. Seeing it from the opposite perspective, there's several reasons why I as a Swiss would not want to live in the US. The most important one is that I'd feel powerless, even as a citizen, versus certain laws that I cannot agree with, like overly zealous child protection laws that have the potential to rip apart families on the basis of trivial things that we do daily in Switzerland (like letting 6 year olds walk to Kindergarden in groups without adults). I don't want to discuss this particular law, it's just an example of a part of civil life I can't agree with. So what's the difference then, there are laws in Switzerland too, right? Let me make my case why it's different here:  1) As a Swiss I'm actually capable of making a difference in terms of government if I don't agree with something and if I can convince enough other common people from my cause, i.e. force a Referendum or even the vote for a new law.  2) Since Switzerland is federal almost to an extreme, to the point where most regulations that affect me personally are either communal or cantonal, i.e. shared by between 500 and 1M people. This means that, for changing something that affects me, the number of people that I (or my amateur political organization) has to convince is small enough that I don't need to spend millions on a campaign - if I find enough helpers sharing my view, it can in fact be done by just paying for the print material and some gas/train fare money.   3) So why can't you do this (i.e. points 1 and 2) in the indirect democracy used in the US? Why is OP completely powerless if he wants to stop American involvement in foreign wars, even though many of his contemporaries probably share his views (see the stats I've posted elsewhere here)? Well, from what I can see, the American election system is mostly broken. There's just no-one to vote for that will actually do a difference in that regard, because your vote will not count. And without a few billion dollars in stock you won't be able to do anything about this.  4) I find the authorities in Switzerland to be quite lenient when it comes to everyday issues. As a citizen I can with very high certainty just follow 'common sense' without knowing all the legal technicalities, and I'll never be bothered with the law - the law is only there to cover the corner cases, everything else, while many regulations exist, most of them are not relevant anymore and wouldn't be accepted in court, and there isn't much chance for you having to go there anyway. The main difference is probably that it's almost impossible to get a lot of money through civil lawsuits, so noone bothers.  So, because of this, I have to say that I can't find anything wrong with someone who wants to vote with his feet, if he can't vote at the ballot. So OP, if this issue is close to your heart and you don't have too many responsibilities that tie you to your home country, and you are well informed about what you'll expect at your destination, then go for it.   Just let me add here, that immigrating to Switzerland is very very tough for non-EU citizens. A fact that I'm actually very sad about, and something I'd like to get politically involved with in order to change (however at the moment it seems like this might change by just letting politics run their course in a few years, i.e. our contracts with the EU going down the drain). Even if you find a way to immigrate (basically a work contract or marriage), be aware that becoming a citizen involves learning a national language and takes 5-10 years of your life. If that's still OK for you then go for it - otherwise there's plenty of countries you could look into, that are more welcoming to immigrants.   Best of luck anyway.  edit: added 4th point."

Switzerland,37aln7,Macattack278,3,Tue May 26 23:18:07 2015 UTC,"welcome, Sir. Btw. about my 'a few billion dollars spare' statement, I just had an idea how someone with that kind of money could actually change things.  Step 1) Lobby every congressman. Completely offset the money spent by other lobbying groups. Support every campaign.  Step 2) As a condition for your support, have these simple rules:   (a) The future/current congressman/woman may not under any circumstance accept any other money.   (b) His/her campaign is to come completely from her/his own ideas about how to better the nation. You provide no guidance whatsoever. If (s)he doesn't have any ideas, pay her/him not to run for office.   (c) Once in Office, you lobby them all to follow through with what they ran under in their campaign, to a T. Again, offset every other lobbying effort.   Step 3) Once the congress is under your 'control' (control that you now have in fact delegated to the voter), have a single law prepared, that will come from you rather than from congress. This law says: ""All contributions to campaigns for citizen running for congress are now illegal. Political advertisement using motion pictures (TV, movies, animated internet ads..) are now illegal. Each citizen running political campaigns can request a federal budget for print materials, travel expenses and rent of townhalls. Failure to comply results in immediate and lifelong termination of current and future public office positions for this citizen, as well as a penalty payment of 10x what was received as contribution or payed for motion picture ad."" Bribe every congress member to support this law, e.g. by providing lifelong high paying jobs at one of your companies. As a bonus payment (after they leave congress) they may receive double the amount of campaign money that they would have otherwise received for running one electoral campaign.   What do you estimate, how many billions of dollars would you need? Could Gates do it, if he wouldn't spend his money for other good causes?"
Switzerland,37aln7,oelsen,4,Wed May 27 02:40:59 2015 UTC,"I'm going to put this bluntly.  People like you are the reason I decided to stay in Switzerland after I did my army service.  For some background, my parents are Swiss immigrants to the US, and I came to do my (mandatory) military service in Switzerland and decided I liked it better here.  Now let me explain why.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but that opinion may or may not be realistic or worth sharing.  The biggest issue I find with the American mindset is that everyone is convinced that their way is right regardless of their actual qualifications on the matter.  There's a reason the evolution debate is only really an issue in the US.  I'm still fairly young but I've worn a lot of hats in my life so far and the most important thing I've learned is that the more you know about anything the less outrageous it will seem (should it be outrageous at all), which means that it would be idiotic to hold opinions on subjects I don't understand in depth.  Swiss people, at the very least, keep their opinions to themselves.  Americans shout their beliefs to anyone who will listen and many who won't.  If you'll pardon me making assumptions to your politics (as you do seem to be part of a particular type), there are some issues that you're likely to find with the culture here:   The army is 'mandatory', and a good 2/3 of men do military service.  You will see them out and about in uniform and frequently carrying assault rifles.  Furthermore, they take their service weapons home when not actively attending military service.  I believe the guns-to-people ratio is pretty close to 1:2 here. Private gun regulation is relatively lax compared to other countries, and many people are competitive shooters (myself included).  While you won't see it every day, seeing a guy with a gun is not uncommon. There's a federal shooting range in nearly every town in Switzerland.  Foreigners seem to like to buy houses next door and then make noise complaints to get them shut down.  Please don't do this.  It's a huge pain in the ass for everybody and it isn't hurting anything.  If you don't want to hear gunshots don't move next to the shooting range."

Switzerland,377elb,failberry,3,Mon May 25 14:18:40 2015 UTC,"Hey,  I'm not sure if there is a course available anywhere. In my opinion, the subject really is not complex enough to provide material for seperate lessons and one can easily find the relevant information in books. But maybe I am wrong about this.  However, this topic falls under the category of ""administrative law"" (fr: droit public, droit administratif; ger: Verwaltungsrecht, öffentliches Beschaffungswesen) and should be included in every general law book about public law with some notes to further literature. While I could recommend you some german titles, I'm really not knowledgeable on the french and italian literature concerning this question but maybe something like this would be of some help to you.  If you have the chance to make your way to Switzerland, I recommend searching via Nebis and checking out the book in a library for free so you won't have to spend a fortune for only a chapter or two.  And as a last remark: Simap.ch seems to be the place where the state and contractors exchange information, maybe you will find something there.  Good luck!"
Switzerland,377elb,Ordnungsbusse,1 point,Mon May 25 18:08:04 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for the informations. I have a question For you: According to the swiss law is it possible that the law changes from canton to canton? Sorry if its not the proper place to ask Im trying to get just a General info.
Switzerland,377elb,Ordnungsbusse,2,Mon May 25 18:14:50 2015 UTC,"No worries, mate.  I just briefly read the chapter in my law book and yes, this is not only possible but highly likely. Depending on who acutally requested the offer some things might work differently. The federal state has it's own law concerning this subject - here's the french version  - so it might be a bit easier.  However, some (all?) cantons have joined a contract (""interkantonale Vereinbarung über das öffentliche Beschaffungswesen"") to make the process simpler and more transparent for the private sector. So I guess the differences are not overly concerning. However, this really is only a guess."

Switzerland,374ew3,SatoyS,1 point,Mon May 25 07:25:50 2015 UTC,I did not yet accept their terms and conditions to log in (as I have no interest in streaming TV) but as it uses my existing myUPC account I think probably that is enough. Same reasoning as when you have a TV and you could just plug it in to the socket.
Switzerland,374ew3,YeaISeddit,1 point,Mon May 25 13:10:27 2015 UTC,"Cablecom can't offer internet without basic TV. The socket even costs you about 30 Franks a month, but you can get it sealed, otherwise you have to pay Billag. My advice: Fiber7 if possible otherwise go for Sunrise (it is probably the cheapest and works fine for me)."
Switzerland,374ew3,furbyhater,2,Mon May 25 03:04:35 2015 UTC,otherwise you have to pay Billag   Only if you have a tv or other device that you could plug into the socket. I do not.

I asked the very friendly (not) people from Billag whether or not I had to pay when I only have an internet connection when I moved into my own flat. I hate TV, I never listen to radio but they still force me to pay almost 500.- a year, they then went ahead and told me all the things that would happen if I didn't pay."
Switzerland,374ew3,Motzlord,-3,Tue May 26 12:39:08 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter. If you have an internet connection you have to pay  the billag fees. With internet you have access to all the content of the SRG. Even if you only have a smartphone you're obligated to pay the fees.
Switzerland,374ew3,dereddib,10,Sun May 24 20:34:56 2015 UTC,"No, this is not true. For TV tax you have to have an account with a provider that lets you watch streaming TV.  Streaming content of the SRG that is acessible without an account does not count here and the definition of ""empfangsgerät"" has nothing to do with being able to acces SRG content. You have to pay even if you have a TV connection that does not let you see SRG content.  For radio, you do have to pay as soon as you have an internet connection.   This what Billag themselves say about it:   Wenn Sie mit Ihrem Computer, Tablet oder Handy fernsehen können, melden sie sich für den Fernsehempfang an, falls Sie über ein Konto (auch kostenlos) bei einem Anbieter von Internetfernsehen (IP-TV) verfügen."

Switzerland,374ew3,yesat,1 point,Mon May 25 13:13:25 2015 UTC,Simple isn't equal to better. We are in the year 2015 and it is possible to give only access to people who really want to see/hear thr Billag related channels! I am ok with 1 channel in each language and they should send the absolut basics like the news. If you like to have the others pay more.
Switzerland,374ew3,Motzlord,2,Mon May 25 13:59:49 2015 UTC,"It's a legit point of view. I see it as a public service to be able to offer more than just some news on the different medium (Radio, TV and Internet.) The balance is hard, you can critic that they go too far with sports, tv shows,... but I don't think we have a market big enough to support private channel in Switzerland, specially for the minorities.  And a not only the SSR benefits from the licence fee, even if their cut is smaller. I personally don't want a info/sport/coverage service run à la Blick/Matin/20min, it's already bad enough for newspaper."
Switzerland,374ew3,qwertyfoobar,1 point,Mon May 25 14:31:31 2015 UTC,"A big part of sport is already private --> Teleclub. But I am talking about things like voice of Switzerland, fuck this shit!"
Switzerland,374ew3,Motzlord,1 point,Mon May 25 14:39:53 2015 UTC,"Some big sustainable sports are on Teleclub. You won't see a lot of other sports on there and the organisation of ""big"" events relies on the public services (skiing, cycling,... couldn't really exist without the TV, Teleclub doesn't have the popularities nor the infrastructures to produce their live content, which show of our qualities)  For entertainment, they are looking on where the number are, and that kind of show, I imagine, cover itself up thanks to its ratings and ads the license fee being used only in the broadcasting/hosting, or they would have dropped it (and I would also imagine that the license for ""the Voice"" was proportionnaly lower than in other country, the SRF being the only one really able to give it a proper rating.)  I know more about the RTS media world: they have ""junk"" shows and reality TV but a lot of them have a slight twist that give them a different taste that similar products beside all their specific shows that can only be made on a public TV and their radio offer is top notch."
Switzerland,374ew3,Motzlord,1 point,Mon May 25 15:17:52 2015 UTC,"But still I have to ask, why do I have to pay for it? I see the point of most taxes like AHV, but with Television and Radio I always should have the chance not to use it and therefore not paying for it!"
Switzerland,374ew3,qwertyfoobar,1 point,Mon May 25 15:45:16 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with the service public, but I think it's stupid that everyone pays the same, regardless of income. 450.- is a lot of money if you don't earn much. I quite like the way they handle it in Finland, there is a min-max fee and the amount you pay is determined by income. So say poor people, students etc pay the minimum fee and people who can afford it pay the full fee. Then you could also handle it via the Steuererklärung and get rid of the Mafia that is billag."
Switzerland,374ew3,Motzlord,1 point,Tue May 26 11:07:35 2015 UTC,you could also handle it via the Steuererklärung    My understanding is that it is not really possible to handle anything extra via the tax declaration because their IT infrastructure is incredibly old and inflexible. And we know what happens when they try to update it...
Switzerland,374ew3,qwertyfoobar,1 point,Tue May 26 14:28:07 2015 UTC,"Haha, well they better get on it, it's not gonna resolve itself."
Switzerland,374ew3,Motzlord,1 point,Tue May 26 14:39:12 2015 UTC,"It is quite high, even more when it often comes with a contract in a network. It does have to support 3 languages in a full shedule and a 4th one in a reduced manner, but more flexibility depending on the ressource could probably be more flexible with the income, but only if it leave the present structure."
Switzerland,374ew3,qwertyfoobar,1 point,Tue May 26 14:53:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed. However I think they should really bill people per person, not per household. For example: I'm a student in Zürich, I have a ""Wochenaufenthalter"" permit. But I have to pay billag in ZH even though the household where my ""Wohnsitz"" is is already being paid for.  I don't think it's that people don't want to pay at all, it's just that it's too expensive and unfair. I think it would actually help if it was done via the taxes because then they could see how much each language region pays (down to single people) and allocate the resources accordingly."
Switzerland,374ew3,Motzlord,-3,Tue May 26 15:32:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The moment they know you own a smart phone and don't pay billing, you'll be in deep trouble.  Your cellphone is radio and TV capable, that's enough to have you to pay even if you don't use it (same goes for a TV that is only connected to your PC and your PC is not connected to the internet. it's enough to own a tv/radio capable electronic device, no matter if you use it or not."
Switzerland,374ew3,qwertyfoobar,1 point,Mon May 25 09:00:24 2015 UTC,"You are wrong. You need to have a free or paid user account with a online TV provider, too, as well as media player software. Can't get out of paying for radio, but not paying TV is easy enough."

But well, @Swisscom_Care stopped sending tweets because in the description they say ""Mo-Fr (8-21h) | Sa-So (10-14)""  The problem persists, since 2pm we haven't had any official news about the status of the problem and their web page doesn't even mention the problem (https://www.swisscom.ch/en/residential/help/network-and-service-status.html)  This is a big WTF.

Switzerland,372rwm,ours,10,Sun May 24 09:43:08 2015 UTC,Hi! We're currently looking into the issue with cloudflare. I'll update this thread with more information.  Thanks!
Switzerland,372rwm,notenoughcharacters9,6,Sun May 24 21:38:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the great information. This was extremely helpful. I've reached out to Cloudflare and they've identified an issue with the problematic network provider. To be clear, this is not an issue with reddit nor cloudflare."
Switzerland,372rwm,Kazumara,2,Sun May 24 22:06:45 2015 UTC,"So it was Swisscom after all? They tried to mislead us? Or GTT? If you can't say specifically please just tell us, was the problematic party western or eastern of the Atlantic Ocean?"
Switzerland,372rwm,bdzz,1 point,Sun May 24 23:23:39 2015 UTC,Most likely it was a problem at CloudFlare. We had the same connection problem in Hungary with the Deutsche Telekom network.
Switzerland,372rwm,Kazumara,2,Mon May 25 00:22:12 2015 UTC,After this admin just said it was not cloudflare?  That also doesn't explain why keychatter.com was down
Switzerland,372rwm,denvit,0,Mon May 25 06:20:17 2015 UTC,"Actually the issue was with Cloudflare, I contacted GTT yesterday and received a mail at 21:39.  The mail states that it isn't a GTT problem, but it's on the Cloudflare part, as I tought at first.  Here is the complete mail: http://pastebin.com/0t7Mijkk"
Switzerland,372rwm,Kazumara,0,Mon May 25 11:11:00 2015 UTC,Oh hey thanks for the follow up.  Now the question remains why did cloudflare block Swisscom and apparently Telekom in some countries and others. And how does Keychatter fit into the picture. But I think the reddit admins might not be allowed to tell us
Switzerland,372rwm,denvit,0,Mon May 25 11:43:29 2015 UTC,"Let's ask  /u/notenoughcharacters9 We're free to ask, maybe they aren't allowed to tell us as you said, but at least we tried :P  In my opinion they blocked a range of IPs for the home network because of some sort of attacks on the cloudflare network, but I don't know. It seems pretty strange. When those things happens you only blacklist one single IP address, not a complete range..."
Switzerland,372rwm,Kazumara,0,Mon May 25 12:17:08 2015 UTC,"If you do /u/notenoughcharacters9 that will notify them  I get that you would block a subnet as small as possible obviously, which is why I find it all the more concerning. Maybe the swisscom home routers have been misused in a botnet. Obviously that is the worst case scenario but it feels like we should be informed after all this. And swisscom won't do it."
Switzerland,372rwm,denvit,1 point,Mon May 25 12:26:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, sorry, my fault. Confused Reddit mentions with Twitter :P  The worst thing that Swisscom did is that they didn't even adviced their customers about the problem, nor setted an ETA. They were like ""okay, there is a problem, but it's sunday, who cares"", and then the issue was solved by reddit by contacting cloudflare or whatever.  (My ticket at cloudflare is still open and no one answered since I opened it yesterday)"
Switzerland,372rwm,notenoughcharacters9,1 point,Mon May 25 12:28:32 2015 UTC,"When I was on the phone with cloudflare. I had them look at all of the trace routes in this thread. More than a few of the trace route showed that there was a routing loop, in GTT somewhere in the EWR region.  EG   15 ae1-70g.ar2.ewr1.us.as4436.gtt.net (69.31.94.118) 95.707 ms 100.135 ms 97.653 ms   They said that this issue is likely due to a misconfiguration in GTT's network. Cloudflare had an idea on how to reroute traffic away from the EWR region but that change would take a while to implement. About an hour later, I got reports that everything was working again, I pinged cloudflare and they said haven't implemented a configuration change on their side.  tl;dr So long story short, There was a routing loop in GTT somewhere near EWR. The problem magically fixed itself and cloudflare didn't have to do anything."
Switzerland,372rwm,denvit,1 point,Mon May 25 18:51:06 2015 UTC,"That's strange. Cloudflare and GTT were blaming each other. I wouldn't say ""it was a GTT problem"" or ""it was a Cloudflare problem"" but someone obviously caused the problem.  The guy from GTT checked the ""problematic"" server and said that everything was good (see the email above). Maybe after he sent the mail he spotted the problem and fixed it.  That's really strange, but I'm glad it's fixed. As I said while ""we"" solved the problem Swisscom was trying to understand how reddit works (and I'm pretty sure they are still trying to) :D  Thanks everyone for the efforts in helping to fix the bug, I'm pretty sure that without all the traceroutes it would have been way more difficult. Obviously thanks also to /u/notenoughcharacters9 for contacting Cloudflare, I also tried to, but the only thing I could have done was to open a ticket on their support site, without even being considered"

Switzerland,372rwm,bdzz,1 point,Sun May 24 21:55:02 2015 UTC,Thanks all. I'm pretty sure calling 0800800800 and taking the time to explain the problem to whoever was listening helped. Swisscom can't ignore thousands of calls requesting the same thing.
Switzerland,372rwm,denvit,2,Mon May 25 09:53:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! Looks like it's working now
Switzerland,372rwm,ced22,8,Sun May 24 22:09:50 2015 UTC,"UPDATE: I contacted Cloudflare by opening a ticket. Since gfycat and reddit are on the Cloudflare network maybe the Swisscom proxy IP was blacklisted.  We'll see, let's wait for an answer from the support team of Cloudflare..."
Switzerland,372rwm,oelsen,2,Sun May 24 11:38:31 2015 UTC,"If that works, you're a hero. :)"
Switzerland,372rwm,denvit,1 point,Sun May 24 11:47:25 2015 UTC,"And Swisscom does not have anything to do with it. I don't see why the blacklisting by a thirdparty is Swisscoms business. They can help, but they don't have to."
Switzerland,372rwm,oelsen,1 point,Sun May 24 15:52:29 2015 UTC,"They have to, because it's their IP that got blacklisted (if that's the problem), it wasn't our fault.  It's like saying that if Google or Facebook blacklists the Swisscom IP they shouldn't help because it's not their fault. I mean, wtf, you put offline an entire nation (because Swisscom is the top ISP in Switzerland) and leave everything as this? If MY ip was blacklisted for a reason I would have be the only responsable, but the ip is their, so it's their business to check & fix."
Switzerland,372rwm,denvit,1 point,Sun May 24 16:02:48 2015 UTC,This would be a nice lesson to learn about alternatives for a whole nation.  Whaaaaaaaaat? Facebook blocked our country???
Switzerland,372rwm,Kazumara,1 point,Sun May 24 16:11:54 2015 UTC,"Swisscom has a nice service in the overall, but you can't block the whole nation access to a website without even giving an official news about the incident. I mean, they got called several times and received a lot of messages on twitter, why should they ignore the problem?  The alternative for the moment is TOR, maybe in the future would be another ISP if that's the way of managing the issues..."
Switzerland,372rwm,ced22,1 point,Sun May 24 16:21:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes they do have to. They either did something or let someone on their network do something to get it blacklisted by some service providers. They have to fix this in cooperation with those service providers for the sake of their costumers.  It's the same as with email domains really. If you have a breach and someone uses your infrastructur to send so much spam that it gets you blacklisted on a domain block list or similar you have to figure out what got you blocked resolve it, make an official statement and try to get off the list."
Switzerland,372rwm,denvit,1 point,Sun May 24 16:36:55 2015 UTC,"They don't necessarily have to do something themselves, but they should at least coordinate mitigation on the third party site and most importantly communicate ETA of a resolution and any other information to customers immediately and not two days later."
Switzerland,372rwm,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Sun May 24 16:56:28 2015 UTC,"They didn't do anything you said. They just ""acknowledged the problem"" (well, not really, the said that from their offices everything works fine: https://twitter.com/Swisscom_Care/status/602439290627424258) but they neither made an official statement saying like ""Okay, we have some problems and we're working on it""  I would say that ""Not a Single Fuck Was Given Today"""

Switzerland,372rwm,denvit,1 point,Sun May 24 17:02:39 2015 UTC,Why is swisscom even using a proxy?
Switzerland,372rwm,Kazumara,1 point,Mon May 25 00:00:49 2015 UTC,My guess would be that in this way they have a control of the overall. This should be called a transparent proxy
Switzerland,372rwm,denvit,1 point,Mon May 25 09:43:10 2015 UTC,Control of the overall what?
Switzerland,372rwm,iwonderhowlongmyuse,1 point,Mon May 25 11:45:04 2015 UTC,"I think that it's all about filtering and such things. I'm not a Swisscom technician but as I saw from the errors it appears that Swisscom is actually using a sort of proxy (named lss408 - Lausanne and zhb408 - Zurich in my case) to provide some web pages. But that error appeared only via the mobile network, via the home network the page returned just a connection timeout (as a browser error). Maybe the proxy is used to count how many MBs of data does a mobile subscriber use."
Switzerland,372rwm,denvit,1 point,Mon May 25 12:14:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe not necessarily a proxy but a router or a cdn. Traffic is absurdly expensive in Switzerland, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was a proxy though (also proxies don't work if you use ssl to connect to reddit)."
Switzerland,372rwm,iwonderhowlongmyuse,1 point,Tue May 26 10:30:44 2015 UTC,Are you sure? Transparent proxies should work even with SSL
Switzerland,372rwm,denvit,1 point,Tue May 26 10:38:41 2015 UTC,But wouldn't the traffic be encrypted? What is their point?

Switzerland,372rwm,Kazumara,3,Sun May 24 11:29:01 2015 UTC,"The guy I talked to was just a first-level technical support assistant, he just escalated the case to the Swisscom technicians but as he said they do not work on Sunday..."
Switzerland,372rwm,denvit,4,Sun May 24 11:41:08 2015 UTC,"I kind of don't believe him. They must have someone available. As the biggest ISP in a country it's not possible to just ignore routing problems for two days.  Thanks for your response in any case.  I think I'll call too, maybe that helps with escalation."
Switzerland,372rwm,Kazumara,2,Sun May 24 11:54:15 2015 UTC,"I think he tought that reddit wasn't a ""big site"" so he talked about the 2nd level technicians, not the higher level ones. If I said that the site was Google.com I think it will have escalated it directly to the highest IT Support.  Call them, the many we are the fastest they will find a solution. Anyway he, through an internal swisscom proxy (proxy.swisscom.com) was able to browse reddit. Really slowly but he could.  Since I don't have access to that proxy I couldn't do a traceroute and find the problem..."
Switzerland,372rwm,denvit,3,Sun May 24 11:59:33 2015 UTC,"After talking to ""the technician"" mr. phonyguy told me the problem was known and invistigated. They determined that certain servers didn't respond to Swisscom anymore. I also told him about keychatter.com so he could add it to the ticket. Apparently Swisscom is talking to some relevant parties overseas and they were told the problem should have been resolved by 14:00. Who knows maybe it's done soon.  It was fun I bombarded him with information from the start and he didn't even ask me to unplug or reboot anything as they usually like to do."
Switzerland,372rwm,AlunViir,3,Sun May 24 12:20:40 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing firstly, I didn't let him talk. I ""bombarded"" the ""phonyguy"" with a lot of informations, saying that for sure is a Swisscom problem since it does work under Cablecom network and even on Twitter people were talking about the connection problem. He ended up by hanging up the phone while I was ""explaining"" the problem (lol)  I recalled and found another guy to which I talked about the problem.  He ended up with not answering me"

Switzerland,372rwm,FunkyFreshJayPi,2,Sun May 24 19:44:46 2015 UTC,Good point. It is still a top 100 website then. Isn't this what you pay an ISP for? :)
Switzerland,372rwm,ced22,1 point,Sun May 24 21:00:03 2015 UTC,Yeah but I understand why it's not really high priority for swisscom as it's not a very important site.

Switzerland,372rwm,denvit,2,Sun May 24 21:19:03 2015 UTC,not possible to just ignore routing problems for two days.   Then you would not get a 503. 503 means http so you reach something.

Switzerland,372rwm,Kazumara,1 point,Sun May 24 12:06:56 2015 UTC,"might be that Phones and DSL are on ""older"" infrastructure while fiber is on the ""newer"" infrastructur and is therefore routed differently or is on a different subnet or has a different way to translate between ipv6 and ipv4."

Switzerland,3721f7,ughthat,4,Sun May 31 17:52:56 2015 UTC,"The term you are looking for is ""ANOBAG"" (Arbeitnehmende ohne beitragspflichtigen Arbeitgeber). Here's more information: https://www.svazurich.ch/anobag  The gist of it is that you'll have to pay the social insurances for both the employer and the employee. The link above tells you exactly how much that is in percent of your income.  Taxes you pay in Switzerland (as far as the Swiss are concerned). If you earn below a certain threshold you shouldn't have to pay taxes in the US, but you'll still have to submit a tax return.  There's also the BVG (pension) you'll have to pay for. That however is yours to keep. If you leave Switzerland in a few years you can either leave the money in a special account (Freizügigkeitskonto) until you reach age 65 and get a monthly pension, or take the money with you (if you go live in a country outside of the EU).  You still need a work visa and I'm not sure how that works, but shouldn't be a problem if your wife has a work visa.  edit: Alternatively and if it makes sense you could also form your own GmbH (LLC) and invoice the US company. The bottom line is pretty similar to the ANOBAG approach, but you get more options in terms of tax optimization. The big downside is that it's quite a bit of administrative overhead, so I would only go down this route if you want to do some freelancing for other customers as well for example."

Switzerland,36zwrl,CesarV,2,Sat May 23 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"I'll let someone else comment on the actual trails, but I'll just say that Switzerland is really fun for hiking and camping. Tons of forests, mountains, lakes, pastures, etc. The only experience I have camping/hiking is in the Jura mountains which I find ideal for this cause if you don't know it's a mountain range that is low enough that basically the entire thing is covered in forests and pastures, which you couldn't say about the Alps.   Just a fair warning, I did a hiking trip in high school years ago, and for some reason the school didn't know about this, but around parts of the Jura (not sure how much of it, I was around the St. Cergue-La Cure area) there are random large holes in the ground that are very deep and are often covered in bushes so it's hard to see. In pastures they are circled with barbed wire fencing to stop cows falling in I guess. We were hiking and had no idea, and then another local hiker told us to be careful lol. Not sure where those trails pass, but if they pass in Vaud, La Dole area is really nice and you can hike up to it and have an amazing view, and you can camp or get a hotel in St Cergue."
Switzerland,36zwrl,SwissBliss,3,Sat May 23 16:32:00 2015 UTC,"there are random large holes in the ground that are very deep and are often covered in bushes   Those are called dolines, and they're a typical geological feature of Karst landscapes, of which the Jura is an example."

So I am familiar with what it is like, but most of the wilderness I experienced was limited or through the window of a train.  Really looking forward to experiencing the hiking trails there.  I will keep Jura in mind and see if either the Green or Red trails goes through it.  And thanks for the warning, I'll look out for big holes."

I didn't see many people, and it was mostly rural hiking by myself, but the trail is very well market and there are many small towns, and mountain huts to re-supply at.   If you go this route then you'll pass through engelberg, grindwald, lauterbrunnen, and kandersteg. All of which are very beautiful and well known alpine villages."
Switzerland,36zwrl,Chocolate_fly,1 point,Sun May 24 10:17:17 2015 UTC,"Great to get feedback from someone that has done one of these trails, thanks very much!  And glad that the Green trail gets high praise.  I hope you wouldn't mind me picking your brain for more details of the trail.  When you say ""rural,"" do you mean like, hiking through the forest/woods?  Or farmlands?  Or both?  And how much hiking on asphalt is there?  Are you allowed to camp on the trail in nature (i.e. stealth camping) or do you have to camp only in ""official"" campgrounds?  Did you take a shelter (e.g. tent or tarp) with you, or did you rely on huts and/or hostels/BBs?  Or a mix of both?  What time of year did you do your hike?  How is the bug (mosquitoes, midges, wasps, etc.) situation on the trail during the summer?  Sorry for all the follow up questions!  I will have to look up some of those villages now.  Thanks again and hope to hear back from you :)"
Switzerland,36zwrl,Chocolate_fly,2,Sun May 24 11:21:26 2015 UTC,"Well I haven't hiked the red trail, but I have been hiking in some of the areas it passes through. I think you would enjoy the hiking more in the green area, but that's just my opinion.   The hiking is mostly in forests and alpine areas, where you will be hiking above the tree line and exposed to the sun (you will need sun screen and a good pair of polarized sun glasses). Most of the time you'll be above the tree line, but the views of the mountains are fantastic from that vantage point. Everyday you will pass by a few farms, each of which you can stop at to purchase fresh cheese or occasionally cured meats. There is not much asphalt hiking, except when you pass through a village, which will be once per day. (Most people sleep in the villages at night, and each day you hike up and over a mountain pass, and sleep in the next village. This is the common way to hike these trails). The villages are small so you won't see much asphalt even in these areas. (as a side note i do remember there being a lot of asphalt hiking from meiringen to grindelwald, but the trail went through the woods so it was a nice walk).   Stealth camping is illegal, but many people do it. I did occasionally. However, the areas around grindelwald and lauterbrunnen will be too crowded to stealth camp and you should probably stay at a campground (i recommend the 'camping jungfrau' in lauterbrunnen). This would be a good opportunity to use the showers at the campgrounds too! Otherwise you can probably find a place in the forest outside of the villages to camp. I recommend setting up your tent just before sunset, and waking up just before sunrise. If you do this then you will have no problems (this is what I did often while hiking in the valais region). Be respectful of the forests and nearby farmland, obviously. Don't build a fire unless there is an obvious place to build one.   For comparisons, I paid ~10-15CHF for a campsite, or ~25-40CHF to stay at a hostel/mountain hut.   I hiked in August and the weather was nice. I didn't have any problems with insects. One other thing I will say is that the hiking is very strenuous. You'll be hiking up and over a steep mountain pass every single day. It's not dangerous, and the trails are well marked, but you will get tired. Wear good shoes, take care of your blisters, and most importantly keep your pack as light as possible! it makes a big difference.   Please ask more questions if you have any, I like to talk about it..."
Switzerland,36zwrl,Herr_Buenzli,1 point,Sun May 24 21:42:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks again for all the great tips and feedback!  I was actually leaning towards the Green trail based on the small amount of research I have done, seems very scenic, and I like that it goes right through the heart of Switzerland.  I am very glad to hear there is limited asphalt hiking.  I hate hiking on asphalt!  I wish that trail guides and maps would do a better job of showing when hikers will be out in nature or just on a road for cars.  The aesthetic issues aside, there are also pragmatic issues for hikers.  I generally hike between 20-30km a day when I am backpacking, and have little or no issues doing this and even a bit longer if it is on a woodland trail.  My personal record in a day is 37km and only got a few small blisters, and was able to hike over 20km the next day no problem.  But hiking on asphalt hurts and cramps up my legs/hips/lower back, and I get more blisters too.  I can only hike about 10km before I start to feel pain and blisters begin on asphalt.  I grew up in the USA where it's illegal to camp in most places other than ""official"" campgrounds, but did quite a lot of stealth camping, so I know the routine ;).  I also don't usually make a fire, only on special occasions really.  It's easier to cook on a stove with your own fuel, and I prefer Esbit tablets for this, which are light and effective.  I am happy to hear there are lots of options for hostels.  I would probably try and do 50% stealth/campground under my tarp and 50% hostels.  The farmers can keep their cheese and meat, what I want is beer and wine!  Nice to hear that there are no problems with insects.  I would probably bring my head net just in case, but leave the bug spray at home.  I am fine with tough hiking and in fact love it.  And as far as light packs go, here is my gear list from last summer, and this summer it will probably be even lighter.  Is that light enough?  :D  I would probably take a bit warmer sleep system due to how high the Green trail is, so it would be cooler there at night.  I am planning for a July trip in a few years after I finish off some trails I am working on here in Sweden.  Glad you like to chat backpacking!  If I think of anymore questions, I will shoot you a PM if that's okay.  :)"
Switzerland,36zwrl,swardoph,2,Mon May 25 12:03:43 2015 UTC,"The scenery is breathtaking. I'm actually from the USA too, and I've since left Switzerland. I just had a short stint there, but did a lot of hiking while I was there.   I took a look at your gear list, it looks like you go ultra-light. That's necessary for this type of hike so you should be OK with pack weight. For food, you can stock up on food items in the villages, so I usually only carried 1.5 days of food with me at all times (usually bread, local cheese, local meat and a few light packaged items). You'll pass fresh water troughs about 2-4 times a day so just fill up when you pass by those (usually outside of farms and in the village centers).   I think 50% stealth and 50% mountain hut would be a good compromise. I would recommend doing some personal research on which mountain huts you'd like to stay at. Generally, the designated 'SAC mountain huts' are in the most scenic areas. They always have beer/wine and hot food too (traditional swiss alp dishes). One that I particularly enjoyed was the  Blümlisalphütte SAC above kandersteg. I only stopped there for lunch and a beer, but I remember it was very nice.   One other thing to look into, when you stay at mountain huts you should research what their accommodation restrictions are. For example, some huts will sell you a bed but others require that you also purchase a meal plan (which can be an additional 20-30CHF) which can run your total (bed + food) to the 50-80CHF range and it can get expensive. Of course, the food is wonderful but it can break your budget.  Also, the mountain huts are a ton of fun for socializing with other hikers. If anything its worth staying at them just to meet other people.   Yes, it will be cold on the green trail so you will need a warm sleeping bag. Mine wasn't warm enough so I cold cold at night, but I couldn't afford a nice bag because I was on a shoe-string budget at the time. I woke up to heavy dew on my tent every morning, and lots of fog in the valleys. Not sure how cold it got at night, I just remember it was pretty chilly.... PM me if you have more questions!"
Switzerland,36zwrl,survivalnow,1 point,Mon May 25 20:18:58 2015 UTC,"Just to be sure: you talk about these trails?  I have not hiked all of the trails that make up the routes but since hiking trails in Switzerland are somewhat standardized I make this estimate:  I had a quick look and they do look ambitious, but no problem at all for a reasonably experienced person in his/her thirties.    In general do these trails have more ""raw"" or ""wild"" nature, or is there a lot of road/street hiking from one village to another?   It's probably like this:   1-2% within villages/cities 25% surrounded by farmland 40% in the nature; there will be some cows and sheep scattered around the odd farm you will come across 35% wilderness where you are somewhere high up in the mountains. Still on hiking trails tough."

My friend's wife is Korean and with her Japanese friend they opened a small restaurant/takeaway. They sell original Bentos. It's not too expensive. They make everything by hand so fare, they only have a machine to cut the makki.  You will not find much raw fish, it's a mix of Korean kimbab and Japanese sushi.  They also have student discount.  Edit: I really enjoy their rice ball topped with eggplant."

Renewing residency permit in Switzerland:   get reminder in post: hey your card expires in 5 weeks, come by and renew it (admittedly this reminder is not especially polite, but that could just be my Gemeinde) go to Gemeinde with your passport and existing permit wait approx. 5 minutes in the queue gemeinde speaks english to you, makes all copies of documents themselves pay CHF 100 get new permit in the mail 2 weeks later, 2 weeks before the onld one expires"

Switzerland,36oppg,DumbledoreMD,5,Thu May 21 09:22:01 2015 UTC,"TBH I'm surprised by the replies so far. I personally think Marijuana would be harder to get legalized because...It's still a drug!  Whereas legalizing gay marriage would only affects a small part of the population and has no effect on the rest of the population. And I'm looking forward to legalizing gay marriage. I know we do have the whole 'almost-marriage'-thingie1 but c'mon guys, no adoption rights? and no possibilities of getting kids altogether? Doesn't seems very fair to me.  1 unromantically known as ""registered partnership"""
Switzerland,36oppg,rmesh,4,Thu May 21 16:13:27 2015 UTC,"I think both votes would be hard to predict. I disagree about the drug argument cause to those who oppose gay marriage, homosexuality isn't much better than a drug. I imagine they believe that, like a drug, by making it legal, it encourages their children to become gay. Which is nonsense in my opinion.   I'd love to meet someone who disagrees with the legalization of either and just ask them ""why do you care? why does it matter to you?"". In my opinion smoking a joint is about as harmful to your body as eating a jar of ice cream, or an alcoholic drink. If not immediately legalized, let's at least allow the research of its medicinal uses and why not allow it in certain clubs for 18+.   This is the type of situation where I'd love it if each canton could have their own laws on things like this. Some cantons have a very high rural and ""swiss swiss"" population which influences votes way too much. I feel like a canton like Uri in central Switzerland could keep its current laws like Alabama or something, while more progressive and international cantons like Geneva and Vaud could legalize both like Colorado."

Then again, if it had such a negative impact on the survival of the human race (or any race for that matter, yes, gay animals do exist) we would see less gay people with each generation. The thing is, the numbers are stable (10-15% of the population) so maybe he should revise his understanding of ""weakness"" :P"
Switzerland,36oppg,Hoohm,2,Thu May 21 09:25:44 2015 UTC,Current scientific studies seem to suggest that he is even wrong with that. Being gay does carry some advantages. For starters children with a gay uncle/aunt seem to do better in live than others.
Switzerland,36oppg,SoulLink,1 point,Fri May 22 09:05:14 2015 UTC,"I was also thinking about addressing this as he is indeed not wrong with saying that being gay is a 'natural weakness' in terms of survival.

I'm trying to grasp where you want to go with that.  I'm saying, being gay is a trait that is not disappearing from the population and has a higher percentage than pure randomness would allow, therefore, being gay is not 100% bad in terms of evolution.

I really recommend St. Cergue. It's a really nice little town in the Jura mountains between Geneva and Lausanne (if you know the region it's straight up from Nyon). Basically take the train from Lausanne to Nyon, and then a smaller train to St. Cergue. Up there you can visit the town, go eat at Rando Burger (this may literally be the best burger place in Switzerland and the owners are Swiss-American so they speak English if you need it), and the town is surrounded by miles and miles of mountain forests and pastures so you can hike for however long you want :)  If you do get a car I'd really recommend that you look up La Dole. It's one of the peaks of the Jura and if you look it up you'll see that there's a ball on top of it which you can see from down by the lake even. If you drive to the base of the mountain there's a really nice little refuge where you can eat and drink, and then you can hike up to that ball and back down in like an hour or so (it looks tough, but it's not too hard)."

Obviously for some of the more remote ones you might need a car... You can look at the ""mobility car-sharing"" program if you have a driving license that is valid in Switzerland, but I think it can be quite expensive.  For nice trails I suggest you look around St. Cergue as said by /u/SwissBliss, or many other towns in Jura really. There are also some nice areas by Vevey and at the end of the lake near Valais.  There are also a few ""Parcours vita"" around lausanne which sometimes connect to hiking trails, you can find more information on their website."

Switzerland,36nij5,AlmostPerfekt,11,Wed May 20 17:58:42 2015 UTC,"the military service is a few months but afterwards you're pretty much free, except for repetition.  I don't know how the fact that you only speak English would affect this though.  Check if you have any health issues, maybe you can get discarded, but then you have to pay tax.   You haven't stated what degree you're getting, but even if it's something sought-after I think it's not easy to find English-only jobs for fresh graduates, although I guess it's not impossible since some people can do it.   If you have money to sustain yourself and know someone who can help you translate bureaucratic stuff that needs to be done, and manage to find an apartment (not easy in some places but there's plenty of international people who manage to do it), it doesn't sound too difficult except on the psyche.  The trouble is learning a language from scratch when you have no previous language-learning experience.  Also the concept of full immersion is broken in German Switzerland because they'll all speak Alemannisch while you learn German in class, if you're not used to it at first it won't be easy to connect the dots and see the similarities.  Asylees can do it, you can too.  But you risk throwing away a bit too much time right when your career should begin if you can't find a job, which isn't too good.   You still have one year, how about you begin to learn one of the languages? Learning German or French for an English speaker isn't wasted time even if you decide not to go imho, it gives you a new perspective on how modern English came into being, plus they're useful languages, especially French if you like traveling."
Switzerland,36nij5,Formagella,3,Wed May 20 18:18:28 2015 UTC,"As stated, depending on what you do, there might be not many only English speaking jobs here. So for getting a job it's pretty crucial that you either speak French or German. It will increase your chances of getting a job massively, because it's a basic requirement for almost any job that you speak one of those languages more or less sufficiently. So I think it's better when you take some language courses in advance, it will also make daily life a lot easier. Also even speaking ""normal"" German will increase your cultural immersion a lot."
Switzerland,36nij5,laughinglynx,2,Wed May 20 18:42:53 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Thanks for the info! I am studying computer science in college. Also, what is Asylees?"
Switzerland,36nij5,Formagella,4,Wed May 20 18:40:00 2015 UTC,"an asylee is someone who has been granted asylum, so not a seeker anymore. That usually means they've been here for some time, not fresh off the boat.   Anyway a programmer has increased chances already of finding an English-speaking job and a job in general, but I think the companies that ask only for English are mostly looking for experienced people... If someone wants fresh graduates, he can find plenty who also speak the local language, in addition to English, which is usually preferred. You're entering a competition with swiss graduates plus a lot of people from neighbouring countries who are willing to work for free (at least here in Ticino).   It's worth a try, at worst you will have spent some time abroad in full immersion, but if it's too long I'd worry about CV gaps.   To take maximum advantage of full immersion programs, I think it's best if you start learning german right now, so that when you come here you have basic conversational skills and can start the conversation in the language.  Otherwise you'll spend the first period speaking English only since you know no german at all, and that means wasting time, and you don't want people to get used to talking in English with you otherwise you'll learn nothing."

However, as Swiss citizen you can just waltz in. There are plenty of international companies where English is spoken at least partially, even more in IT.  I'd decide on which language to learn depending on where your family lives.  You'll be certainly drafted into the mandatory military service, there will be an initial assessment of your ability to serve. It may be that they decide to let you off, because you don't speak a national language. On the other hand, spending the 4 month basic training among peers will be an excellent opportunity to learn the language fast."

Switzerland,36nij5,tetroxid,6,Mon May 25 00:48:24 2015 UTC,Computer scientists are in demand. But if you'd speak German your employability would be much higher.

Switzerland,36m1rg,LaoBa,5,Wed May 20 20:41:44 2015 UTC,"I do not understand all this ""write a motivation letter"", ""include CHF 200 in your application"" etc.  This is my advice:   Make sure you are at the FIRST viewing and send the form in immediately the same day if you are interested. This is the most important thing to do, as after the first viewing the agency normally has more than enough applications that they can immediately select a good candidate and coordinate with the owner.  Normally if they want to give you the flat they will ring you and confirm you are still interested, then send a contract in the mail. Only then will they charge you if you don't sign, so it is not a good idea to delay application in case something else comes though. Make sure you look good on paper: no debts, stable income, permanent residency or swiss citizenship for the person with the stable income, no musical instruments or pets etc. For debts, income, residency you should not lie but if you suddenly take up the trumpet after moving in... that's life, eh? ;) Make sure you apply for flats costing under a third of your pre-tax income   that's all. this has worked consistently for me over the last 11-12 years.

As long as you start applying now and not in 3 years or so you should be fine.  If you want to come to Switzerland to work you first have to find a job. When you get a job, the employer will request a residency permit (B) for you. As a EU citizen you can come here for quite some time and look for a job, but you will only get a L permit. The L permit has lots of disadvantages, so housing, bank account, insurance etc. are really troublesome. With the B permit it's all easy.  I don't think we have preferential treatment of Swiss citizens as I think that would be a violation of the current immigration agreement we have with the EU.  Since you speak German you shouldn't have too much trouble finding something in the German part as long as Swiss German isn't a requirement and the rest of your skills match the description.  EDIT: Check out other threads about this topic. We get to read this question a lot around here. I think somebody even created a huge diagram about the immigration process. Of course it's easier for EU citizens than non-EU citizens."

Once you're in, the implementation of the referendum won't touch you, whatever it is, because the treaty says the acquired rights are maintained even if free movement of workers is abolished.

Also, university teams are probs not what you think they are. Most of them function like a normal club and there is no draft or something - elite players are grown through the youth teams. Many university teams just have the name, but the players are not necessarily students."
Switzerland,36kjb2,as-well,4,Wed May 20 08:43:37 2015 UTC,"If you wanna learn clean cut German, then Germany is probably better, although you could still easily learn it here considering schools are in standard german since Swiss German is not written. Plus if you're up for the challenge you can pick up swiss german (it changes a bit depending where in Switzerland you are), and even Italian, and improve your French.  I'm not sure about the hockey, but yes it is quite big here. For the language thing, there are a few cities that speak both german and french officially. Switzerland isn't that big so I'm sure you could live in Berne or something and the french speaking areas in 30min-1hour"
Switzerland,36kjb2,SwissBliss,1 point,Wed May 20 08:00:40 2015 UTC,"Do note hockey is fairly big here, and the skill level for organized teams is fairly high. There are many levels of hockey, but all require a very sound skill level. Not to judge you, but for most people, hockey (skating+puckhandling+general knowledge) takes a few years to get decent at. On the other hand, there is a lot of pick up games at many local rinks to show up, toss sticks and have a fun match with all skill levels. This is known as 'Cneble' in swiss german. If you join an organized team, even in the just-for-fun 'Plausch' leagues, be prepared to perform seriously, and take criticism for not being amazing :P"

On Sundays, Bern is quite empty and no-one is on the streets and all shops are closed(so maybe you'd prefer Saturday, when you can also go shopping). If you're a shopping or coffee drinking person, you can easily spend a couple of hours looking at the old town. You could also go to the history museum, which is quite nice (and most things are in English, too) or one of the other museums - all of them are quite cheap and quite good."

Switzerland,36fj1h,StuffedWithNails,3,Tue May 19 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"Well we have four national languages, one of which isn't spoken anywhere else (Romansch). So that's the only unique to Switzerland language, but it's spoken by a tiny minority  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Map_Languages_CH.png  Those are the language barriers. La Chaux de Fonds is in the north of that green part (French speaking). Major cities for reference, Geneva (French speaking) is to the far West, Zurich (Swiss German speaking) is sort of North, Lugano (Italian speaking) is South, and Romansch is dispersed in the east.  Switzerland was at some point under the rule of Romans, French, Celtics, etc, but has also ruled areas of these countries/empires (Milan was under the Swiss for a bit) and has kept much of those cultures, kind of like the US but much older.  If you're wondering why you call it Swiss German, but not Swiss French or Swiss Italian, it's cause Swiss German varies much more from the original language than the others. For example a person from France could come to Geneva and understand basically everything, whereas a person from Germany could come to Zurich, Berne, or Basel and not understand much considering each of these cities speak a different kind of swiss german, and each of them are significantly different than German.  A typical Swiss person usually speaks one of the four languages perfectly, and another one decently, and most people speak English well too. For example I come from the french speaking part, so I speak French and English perfectly, decent German (not swiss german), and can probably get around in Italian just from knowing french  Here are a few facts about Switzerland if you wanna know :) http://www.expatica.com/ch/about/35-facts-about-Switzerland_100041.html"

At the main station there is a tourist information where they can provide you maps of the city center and advise you on good walking routes through the old town of Zurich. Basically they will tell you to walk along the river to the lake and back. Most sights of the city are along this route and you can spend half a day on this route doing shopping, go to cafes or just lounging at the side of the river or the lake.  Just at the main station the biggest, most expensive shopping street of Zurich called ""Bahnhofstrasse"" starts and goes all the way to the lake. You will also find smaller shops and boutiques in Niederdorf (other side of the river). Both Niederdorf and Bahnhofstrasse are along the suggested route.  In case you want to see something totally different take Tram 13, 4 or 17 from the main station to Dammweg (takes maybe 10 minutes) and check out the boutiques of the Viadukt. This is in the old industrial area of Zurich and quite a nice area as well, however not as busy as the city center. The old industrial area won't be on your map, but the area is easily accessible with local trains and trams, so you won't be stranded at all even if you get lost for a moment."

Switzerland,36dc35,P1r4nha,2,Mon May 18 21:05:46 2015 UTC,If you like the typical high end fashion brands go to Bahnhofstrasse. It's the big road from mainstation down to the lake.  If you like more charming kinda shopping try Niederdorf. There is also The Grossmünster which is a big church and you can go on top of the bell tower and have a good view on to the city.

Switzerland,36dc35,benz8574,2,Mon May 18 15:01:17 2015 UTC,"Take the train and go to the main station (Zürich Hauptbahnhof). From there walk to Central and take the Polybahn (The red cablecar) which brings you to the University. There you will have a nice view from the Polyterasse over the city. Maybe you see some places you want to see from there.  When you're done and (hopefully) don't need to visit anyone in one of the best hospitals of the world take the tram (5) to Kunsthaus (the art museum) which has free entrance every wednesday.  Once you are hungry after watching all those paintings and sculptures, walk down or take the tram again to Bellevue. Get a Bratwurst mit Bürli (sausage with bread) from the Sternen Grill.  Eat your lunch somewhere at the lake and enjoy the view to the Üetliberg (the one on the other side of the lake with the 2 towers on the top). If you'd have enough time I recommend you to go up there.  Afterwards you can shop down the Bahnhofstrasse with all it's expensive boutiques or the Niederdörfli which has some small shops on the opposite side of the Limmat (the river which flows out of the lake) back to the main station. You actually could do both there are bridges to cross all the time.  Back at the Hauptbahnhof eat something where ever you want and head back to the airport :)"

Switzerland,366ehc,CaptIncorrect,2,Sun May 17 08:52:38 2015 UTC,"For sure, but not as much as the map implies.  Personally though I would never associate any country with the word tiny. Apart from Vatican City and REALLY small countries, any country is huge in my eyes, some much more than others"
Switzerland,366ehc,SwissBliss,8,Sat May 16 22:20:33 2015 UTC,I guess it all depends on perspective. I would drive 6 hours from my hometown through forest. Not towns. Not farms. Just untamed forest. Until I saw the next town. Here I can drive from Lausanne to Munich in 5. And that's well into another countey. There isn't really anywhere in Switzerland that your not close to civilization. Even the mountain passes I've hiked you can always see people/towns/power lines. It's just... not the same sense of vast space.
Switzerland,366ehc,CaptIncorrect,1 point,Sat May 16 22:28:32 2015 UTC,"100% agree, and actually I didn't even think of Canada, but I'd add it to Russia. It's the only 2 countries I can think of that are not only huge, but also have a lot of inhospitable land like Siberia or northern Canada. While the US, Brazil, China, etc... are huge, I doubt you could drive 8 hours and not see another village at least.  On the Switzerland note, ya I also agree mostly. There's no where where you can't see a mountain that defines the border to another country. I live in Vaud not far from Geneva, and if I look to one side theres the Alps leading to France and Italy, and on the other side the Jura leading to France. I don't completely agree about the hiking thing. I guess you live near Lausanne, so you'll know the Jura and maybe that whole La Dole - St. Cergue - La Cure region. I'd say that you can get pretty lost in the forests in the mountains and through pastures up there. I went on a two day hiking trip and easily went 6 hours of walking without seeing any civilization. Nothing compared to Canada, but my point was just that Switzerland looks pretty small compared to surrounding countries, which it is, but it's a bit deceptive. From Lake Geneva to the top of the Jura on the map seems like nothing, but walking that is a full day trip.  Don't get me wrong it's not like I'm offended that you're calling it tiny, it's just a word I would never use for a country (apart from Monaco and the like). Canada is definitely massive, and Switzerland is small in comparison, but you could live a lifetime in virtually any country and not see everything, so the term is just a bit weird to me"
Switzerland,366ehc,SwissBliss,0,Sat May 16 23:39:49 2015 UTC,"consider Alaska which is like Canada but it's US.   Also the US has some empty rural areas too but I guess not as empty.   China has a desert. Brazil has a forest. I don't know how much it takes to transverse them.   Also Greenland, you forgot that one."
Switzerland,366ehc,Formagella,1 point,Sun May 17 20:37:37 2015 UTC,"I considered all of those, but my main reasoning is simply that if there is a road to drive on, I imagine within 8 hours you'd come across some sort of settlement, just about anywhere. I might be wrong, but it seems logical"

Switzerland,366ehc,SwissBliss,3,Sun May 17 01:04:41 2015 UTC,"I think you are vastly underestimating the size and overestimating the population of Alaska. There are three cities with a population of greater than 10,000. Switzerland has over 100 cities of that size. the drive between the 2nd (Fairbanks) and 3rd (Juneau) largest cities is 18 hours.

Mongolia has a population density of 1.92 per KM2. So I wondered what country has the lowest and while Mongolia ranks very very VERY low the last place is taken by Greenland (With 0.03/KM2).

Switzerland,366ehc,cazz14159,1 point,Sun May 17 01:36:50 2015 UTC,"Well it depends on how you count, but AFAIK by using the 'metropolitan area' definition which doesn't care about political borders, only what we call 'Einzugskreis' (>x% of people in an area working within the city, with x=40 or so), Tokyo is still the biggest city in the world. And even that monster of a city 'only' has a metro area of 13'700km2, i.e. 1/3 of Switzerland. So yeah, not sure whether you can find a city like that."

Switzerland,368iio,SwissBliss,1 point,Mon May 18 11:42:18 2015 UTC,I would also suggest to make a trip to Mount Rigi. It's not as high as the Mount Pilatus but still very nice views and the best is: With the Swiss Pass you can even travel to the top of Mount Rigi free of charge.
Switzerland,368iio,iwonderhowlongmyuse,4,Wed May 20 12:45:59 2015 UTC,"It looks like you will see a great tour of the country with that itinerary. As a foreigner who had been living in Switzerland for most of a year, I think my biggest piece of advice would be to avoid trying to optimize every moment of your trip and just enjoy your time here. I've been exploring the country whenever possible, and I've found really wonderful places and people basically everywhere I went, from the cities, lakes, and foothills, to the mountains and valley towns. So even if you don't get to see every place on your list, or if you end up somewhere different that you had not heard about before, I can virtually guarantee that you will still have a fun time in a beautiful and charming place.  Have fun!"
Switzerland,368iio,SwissBliss,2,Sun May 17 08:42:48 2015 UTC,"You are right!  I was so stressed about seeing everything in Switzerland, but I came to term with myself to really experience what I can in the short amount of time. I will tale you advice to heart, thank you so much."
Switzerland,368iio,renner2,4,Sun May 17 12:15:58 2015 UTC,"I can tell you about the French Speaking side  Near Geneva I'd recommend Rando Burger in St.Cergue. It's in the Jura mountains in Vaud. Best burger you'll find in Switzerland.  Also if you drive up to La Dole there's an amazing little chalet d'alpage where you can eat and drink on a terrace in the middle of pastures and forests with the view of La Dole which is really impressive and beautiful. If you have 40 or so minutes to spare, I'd really recommend walking/hiking up to the big ball on the mountain (La Dole) and back down. It's a fairly easy hike, and you'll get the best view of Lake Geneva you can get on a nice day. This is personally my favorite place on Earth (I've been to every continent). It may seem simple, but to me it's just so beautiful and peaceful  http://www.chocolatier-tristan.ch/ This is the best chocolate I've ever had, and it's between Lausanne and Geneva. Not a brand just a store that sells chocolate. Lots of tourists go there because of the quality, and it's kinda fun finding it since it's a bit hidden in a small village  In Valais if you go there, I'd recommend seeing the two castles in Sion, Zermatt of course, and Leukerbad (less known than Zermatt but trust me it's breathtaking-the first time I went there I was shocked at how tall and close the mountains were to the town). Also the Col du Sanetsch (Sanetsch Pass in English) is a great drive and links Bern to Sion while being incredibly beautiful.  Please ask if you need any advice about Suisse Romande."
Switzerland,368iio,SwissBliss,2,Sun May 17 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the recommendations!  I was thinking about visiting Jura and Valais, but I thought that they were a little too far away for me to make the best of it.  I will definitely check out the chocolatier though!  Thank you!"
Switzerland,368iio,SwissBliss,2,Sun May 17 18:06:41 2015 UTC,"I meant Jura as in the mountain range, not the Canton. The places I named are in Vaud, as well as the chocolatier :) and are all between 15 and 40 minutes from Geneva.  I do agree that Valais is a bit far and it doesn't seem like your itinerary goes that way anyway, so you should probably skip that this time"

Switzerland,368iio,SwissBliss,2,Sun May 17 19:22:30 2015 UTC,"Rando Burger is an absolute must! Definitely some of the best burgers I've eaten have been from there. It's a short and breathtaking ride away from Geneva, and there are plenty of really cool small through to long hikes in the area.

These are of course no true alpine hiking routes, since Zurich. If you want to go higher you will have to travel. The funicular up mount Hoher Kasten is certainly running, and I believe that there's no snow up there, you could then hike into Saxerlücke and down into the Toggenburg (Wildhaus), you'd have to check the weather for that as I don't know hpw foggy/cloudy it'll be up there."

Nobody can shut them down, except for a specific part of a specific trail because of an event/accident/etc.  In general you can walk everywhere in Switzerland without much limitation. Limited areas are usually fenced-in and clearly labelled. We are not as strict on no-trespassing on private land as other countries. In the alps, basically everything is open to everyone, but you are expected to behave and be respectful."

Switzerland,366mht,xcdo,2,Sat May 16 17:42:58 2015 UTC,"You can book a train on the Italian site (http://www.trenitalia.com/) from Bergamo to Chiasso,   Chiasso looks like a major interchange and is only 15 minutes by car to Riva so you could either get a taxi and head up there or it also looks like there's a line out of Chiasso that goes to Riva where you could presumably get a regional train and just book there ticket at the station. It's very close by so you shouldn't be looking at more than a few euros.   Hope that helps.   Couldn't find the journey on Voyages SNCF which is like the Europe train booking site but it's likely because it's a very regional journey and they're better booked at the ticket office (or the national train site) as opposed to the big cross Europe journeys.   Get the train from Bergamo to Chiasso and either get an ongoing train from there to Riva or just get a taxi. Like I say, 15 minutes in the car.  EDIT: It appears as though there is some kind of tram or metro. Chiasso to Riva S Vitale (Piazza) which I assume is the centre of Riva. It's about £1.50. Book here although it's highly likely to be easier just doing it at Chiasso. http://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets.html  EDIT 2: Here's the tram/metro/whatever it is map.

It's a very regional journey though so you could literally just turn up to Bergamo on the day and buy a ticket and jump on a train (Although will be cheaper in advance!).   Do a search for next week/month and the ticket information will come up. If you want to book in advance then try at the end of the month/June and you'll be fine!

In a few years we all pay the extra 5 Franks again and the only change was, that we can do less against it. Also it isn't fair, that there is no more a possibility not to pay it. With digital TV it should be possible only to give access to the Billag channels to people who pay for it. And for everything on the internet they could solve it with Login!

Chances are your house back then was worth 500k and now is 2 million, because property prices went up and the area is now trendy.  And now if you inherited your parent's nice house two years ago you suddenly get a 200k tax bill. It's one thing if you know in advance and can plan for it.... another to get hit years later.

Switzerland,362kag,Hoohm,2,Sun May 17 23:25:39 2015 UTC,"The problem is more from where ""your"" asset came from.  The reason you have been able to earn money and get assets is because the context (the laws, the structures, the consumers, etc...) has allowed you to earn something. The main reason behind this is the government. The government is paid and gets its power from the taxes and ensures that most people can try and earn something in our society. Considering that once you have earned anything, it's ""yours"" is like having a friend giving you a fishing pole, get some fish, feed yourself and you don't share with your friend saying he didn't do shit to earn it.  The main argument I would see here in favor for the tax is that inequality is still rising. Since lobbyists have a huge amount of power to change laws globally (markets, enterprise) to maximize their profits, having a new tool to get some of that money back is always beneficial. And come on, if you already have 2 millions, what would it change if you only get 1.8 million... One less Ferrari?"

The context that allows you to earn money and get assets is such that you are protected from the government arbitrarily interfering with you doing so. In a free society, the government doesn't give the citizens rights. The government derives its powers from the citizens' consent, and the citizens are free to revoke those powers at will. To use your analogy, the other guy didn't give you a fishing pole he owned. You gave him all the materials and know-how to build it and paid him to do so.  All the ""income inequality is bad"" crowd are really arguing is that they're jealous of those who make more money than they do.

I want to be sure that we speak the same level of ""performance-oriented perspective"" What is the reference for you?   Best return on investment Best use of natural resources   In a sandbox context (as we have on earth) I would argue the latter makes more sense. Finite planet, finite resources, you get my point. Maybe I'm not that liberal but I still hope for a world where rules are not needed for people to manage to live together. I mean, on the premise that we have enough resources for everyone, if not, that's another story.   The context that allows you to earn money and get assets is such that you are protected from the government arbitrarily interfering with you doing so.   You are partly right there, the government also provides protection to the population from the population. You could revoke the power you give it but then you'll end up needing to do your own law and be in conflict every day of your life. This could work... And you are right if you say that the law of the jungle is equally valid globally since there is no true ""better"" way to live in society since there is no ""true"" purpose of the human race. I still do prefer a society where people can trust and work together... It's just more fun to my eyes.   You gave him all the materials and know-how to build it and paid him to do so.   I think I'm confused here. What about the material used to create the fishing pole, who ""owns"" that?   All the ""income inequality is bad"" crowd are really arguing is that they're jealous of those who make more money than they do.   I don't think we can have a perfectly balanced society, but I do think having a big gap between the poor and the rich is a problem in the long run. You just get more trouble in terms of civil obedience, sharing, coworking and the system becomes inefficient in the long run. Do I have to elaborate on that or do you agree?   Your assumption that the cutoff will stay at 2 million is pretty darn naïve, too.   Actually, I don't see where I gave you that impression. I never assumed that it would not change... But I mean... why should it not change? Considering how the money is distributed, it should change to favor a well maintained redistribution of wealth."

Whoever paid for it, of course. May I add that apart from paying for the material, know-how and time to build the rod, you also paid for being able to fish and for the fish as you reeled it in. How exactly having to pay for those things once again simply because you died is in any way just is beyond any logic. It's taxing death, plain and simple.

What you do with your own money is none of anyone else's and, by extension, the government's business.    I agree partially with your statement. The impact of the work (or the end) should also be a factor. I would not encourage the tobacco industry for example... Lot of work, great success, would not encourage it. At all.  Work should pay, that is how I was raised and I do like the notion. Now, I also do think that most rich people don't get richer because they work more than the others. Some might, but most of them don't. If we keep going on the statement, people who work more, should earn more. Since the richer just get richer, either they are working harder every year or the logic is failing to comply.  You say you should be able to use your money as you see fit... legally... but then, you accept the laws, who come from the government... like the taxes... So where should the government stop?  What about the fish, who owns the fish before I get it?  Taxing has no logic at all. There we agree. It's a tool, used to redistribute resources. I mean, there is no tax that makes sense. Why should I pay part of what I earn? Anytime? So logic on why you should tax succession has no importance here.   The rest of your post are unsubstantiated talking points that do not conform to the reality of Swiss society. Thankfully, the voting public is usually smart enough to realize that.

The problem it wants to tackle is that students from St. Gallen receive more money when studying at the ETHZ   See, I'm not even sure this is a problem! People from Zug pay less tax than people from Bern. People from Zurich have better public transportation than people from Graubünden. That's how our country is set up. If the argument was to abolish ""Föderalismus"", then that would be a solid argument. One which I would not agree with, but solid.

Switzerland,362kag,Aethec,1 point,Mon May 18 08:46:34 2015 UTC,"If that were true, why are they estimating (the initiative committee themselves, mind you) that it will cost 500 million per year more than the present cost?"
Switzerland,362kag,Formagella,1 point,Fri May 15 21:30:08 2015 UTC,"Because those two things are unrelated. The change of law does not relate to the cost. The cost are an estimate based on what the initiative committee wishes. But the law will be made by the federation, not by the committee. It could end up costing the same, it could end up costing more, but that is a decision for parliament to make."
Switzerland,362kag,Formagella,2,Mon May 18 08:48:35 2015 UTC,stipend and estate tax initiatives both seem designed to help concentrate more power at the federal level.  this is basically what has been slowly going on in the US for ages.  coming from there i'd say that that trend has had a net negative impact on the political climate and strength of democracy there.
Switzerland,362kag,Aethec,1 point,Sun May 17 12:04:08 2015 UTC,TV I think yes. The number of people without devices capable of playing radio or tv (every computer counts already afaik) is probably almost zero and keeping track of that through a huge burocracy is inefficient
Switzerland,362kag,hubraum,3,Fri May 15 18:07:37 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I don't think people should be forced to finance state-run media at all. How to vote I wonder.   Keep the current system to have people pay for programming they may or may not use, thereby financing an inefficient public entity. Expand the system to include even more people and now also corporations, resulting in even more money for said entity even if it's gonna cost me a little less personally.   The thing I find most offensive about this is the expansion to corporations though. Transocean is gonna pay the same amount as your local bakery? Small business owners are gonna have to pay twice now? How the hell is that just?"
Switzerland,362kag,roscocoltrane,3,Fri May 15 18:20:01 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I don't think people should be forced to finance state-run media at all.   What's a better alternative? The nice thing about a state-run media in Switzerland is that because our political system favors consensus, it's not very partisan. It's sometimes a bit stupid, but so is every media.  An example of a free market in the TV realm is the United States, where almost all ""journalists"" are incompetent idiots who repeat political talking points. Imagine what'd happen if Teleblocher expanded and became a major source of news in Switzerland...  IMHO, delivering news is important enough that it shouldn't be done only by private companies who have 0 interest in delivering the truth, or in reporting on everything that happens."
Switzerland,362kag,Kazumara,1 point,Sun May 17 12:03:26 2015 UTC,"What's a better alternative?   The American NPR/PBS system. They provide the product (which is honestly a lot better than Swiss state media), then they ask you for a voluntary contribution twice a year if you like it. They get some minimal government support (less than 10% of their budget) and sell some ads in the form of ""support for our program comes from company so-and-so (though a lot fewer ads than you get on Swiss state media), but are otherwise paid for by those voluntary contributions. Seems to work fine.  If you judge US media based on partisan products like MSNBC and FOX, your sample is not particularly representative."
Switzerland,362kag,Hoohm,3,Sun May 17 15:24:00 2015 UTC,"the problem is that any Swiss Italian or Rumantsch television channel would be dead, instantly.

Switzerland,362kag,Hoohm,1 point,Sun May 17 21:11:06 2015 UTC,I can understand that an argument can be made for supporting programming in Italian and Rumantsch because the markets really are quite small. There is none to be made for supporting programming in German or French though.
Switzerland,362kag,Hoohm,2,Mon May 18 21:28:02 2015 UTC,"there also are national sports and the movie industry I guess, although you could argue that if people aren't interested enough to make some private networks offer them, they should be let to die...."

If you judge US media based on partisan products like MSNBC and FOX, your sample is not particularly representative.   PBS has bigger ratings than many private networks, but far lower ones than CBS, ABC, NBC and FOX. Only a sixth of Americans say PBS is the channel they trust most; a third trust Fox News the most.  I get your point that it might work, but it might also fail and we'd be left problems like Rupert Murdoch's media control in countries like Australia, leading to biased media."

If money is an issue and you are an ""alternative"" bunch, go to the Reitschule (Restaurant Sous le Pont): Great food for about 20 Franks per meal, very nice nightlife, but probably not your spot if you like high-class clubbing or drinking wine in a nice establishment."

I ended up going with a lycamobile sim since I mainly need data - functionally I don't need regular voice/sms at all, everyone here has whatsapp anyway and I'd use whatsapp/skype/imessage for people back home. Their data packages are the cheapest and per some random wiki they are apparently on the Swisscom network. I've had LTE or 3G full-time while in Geneva the last few days, but have not really gone further afield so far.  Downsides: - No tethering - Feels like a budget option - adding money, selecting packages, all a bit more convoluted than it should be - I tried to use the ""ticket by SMS"" option for public transit here today and it silently failed to send the SMS to the special number. No idea why.  Hope this helps!  Edit: Also on an unlocked iPhone. They have nano SIMs but I don't think they carry them in the local shops - I specifically asked for a nano SIM and the lady behind the counter smiled, nodded, and silently sold me a microSIM. I cut it down to size and it's worked fine, but it's a bit silly."
Switzerland,362qxh,Pahalial,2,Fri May 15 20:54:20 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the advice. I wonder if all carriers only carry mini SIM cards instead of nano - I also have an iPhone 6. Did you find it easy to cut it down to fit the sim slot?
Switzerland,362qxh,Starky_D,2,Fri May 15 23:07:21 2015 UTC,"I purchased a prepaid SIM through Sunrise/Yallo (I think Yallo is the cheaper alternative to Sunrise). They had a SIM for my iPhone 6, shouldn't be a problem since they carry all the newest phones anyway.    I went with the pay as you go with the data option added on, but it's a monthly subscription I believe.  You might be able to do the same thing but just a little pricier since you can't add the monthly data plan."
Switzerland,362qxh,Pahalial,2,Sat May 16 03:51:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it wasn't so bad cutting down the SIM, I just used my existing nano sim from home as a guide. Lyca definitely do have Nano ones listed online, I'm sure some of the bigger shops carrying them have them as well, but without a store locator it's a bit of a crapshoot. For the bigger/less ""budget"" operators it should be easier to track one down.  You also might be able to get them to ship you the SIM before you even arrive in the country, I didn't try myself."

Switzerland,360ae7,LionsPride,15,Fri May 15 00:30:23 2015 UTC,"We've had the concept of registered partnership nationwide for a number of years. It's not exactly marriage but it confers almost all the privileges of ""real"" marriage. You can't adopt children or apply for immigration benefits on the basis of marriage, since it's not marriage. Other than that, it's basically the same.  In terms of public opinion, same-sex marriage is largely accepted and supported by the population.  I'm sure there will always be opponents to it in the foreseeable future, but for the most part, I feel that it's a non-issue. Certainly nothing like what it is in the US (I live in the US)."
Switzerland,360ae7,StuffedWithNails,0,Fri May 15 01:52:04 2015 UTC,"So, the people are pro same-sex marriage, yet they still can't get married? That seems like it could be rather problematic."
Switzerland,360ae7,DeepBlueNemesis,12,Fri May 15 03:03:37 2015 UTC,"Nah, as he said, it's not really an issue. When you talk to people they will say stuff like ""Yeah they really should be able to get married! It's a shame.."" and then change the topic. They won't get riled up and call to arms to change it. It's a topic that is being left alone for the most part right now.  Same with abortion. It could be a lot more liberal (currently at ""You can chose during the first 12 weeks of preg""), people are okay with what it currently is and focus on more pressing matters."
Switzerland,360ae7,P1r4nha,4,Fri May 15 04:10:44 2015 UTC,"More pressing matters like when to buy which sausages..   You're totally right it's just not an issue. Gay communities exist, but they don't make a fuzz about it. I don't think they have a national presence at all.   And I don't know why not. It's not like we really do have a lot of pressing issues. In the US they have a lot more problems with the economy, nature, health, rights and freedoms."

Switzerland,360ae7,DeepBlueNemesis,1 point,Fri May 15 06:59:55 2015 UTC,"Abortion limit at roughly 12 weeks is pretty standard for Western Europe. You can of course have an abortion later in case of severe fetal defects, health problems of the mother etc. and that is interpreted quite broadly.  But in general people are quite good at using contraception in Switzerland. The abortion rate is extremely low, so low that public health initiatives focus on STDs now and not unwanted pregnancy."
Switzerland,360ae7,Urgullibl,-5,Sat May 16 08:47:17 2015 UTC,Such a shame that people are so blasé about important issues.
Switzerland,360ae7,P1r4nha,18,Fri May 15 05:42:50 2015 UTC,"Importance is subjective. I'm not saying that LGBT-Issues are not important, but they are currently just not an issue in Switzerland. The activist groups are mostly silent and just call out homophobic comments in everyday life, but apart from that you hear nothing.   This means that if you are not a part of the movement, it's just not an issue for you. Current problems that are being pressed in the media and politics revolve mostly around immigration, foreign judges, cantonal budgets and the national votes next month. Currently there is a ""nobody talks about it, so why should I care?"" attitude around this issue."
Switzerland,360ae7,Urgullibl,7,Fri May 15 07:06:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there are way more important political issues than what name you give your state-issued license to change the way two people are taxed. The Swiss tend to be pragmatists that way.  Realistically speaking, the only way to change it is by public vote. I'm not aware of any current polls indicating how such a vote would swing (and its chances would also depend on whether it would be put before the voters as a constitutional or a statute law issue), but mostly, it would be a lot of expense to achieve not a whole lot of difference."
Switzerland,360ae7,StuffedWithNails,3,Fri May 15 13:17:32 2015 UTC,I think I read somewhere that the Swiss people are rather pragmatic about it and don't see a problem with gay marriage equalization. It's the politicians that are backwards on this issue and apparently there isn't enough of an active pull to go for a popular initiative.  But my source might be wrong and I'd be shocked when I see how little Swiss people care about equality after all. Who knows.
Switzerland,360ae7,Hoohm,-4,Fri May 15 15:49:17 2015 UTC,"I would assume that a country that has created a department to ensure that guinea pigs and other social animals are not adopted alone would have at least made sure that two people would be able to adopt a child together, but you're right, there are much more pressing political issues."
Switzerland,360ae7,Urgullibl,2,Fri May 15 13:38:10 2015 UTC,"The reason they can't adopt is that there's no way such a provision would have passed at the time registered partnership was voted on. In contrast, legislation on guinea pig husbandry is unlikely to trigger a constitutional referendum."
Switzerland,360ae7,buyacasha,-2,Fri May 15 13:44:51 2015 UTC,"I get that, it just seems strange that for a country that prides itself on being such a beacon for progress, that they've let this non-insignificant issue go by the wayside."
Switzerland,360ae7,buyacasha,11,Fri May 15 14:03:27 2015 UTC,"If you know a little about Swiss democracy, you probably know this, but in case you don't, anyone can start what is called a popular initiative, where you basically submit a proposal to modify the constitution. Unlike in many other countries, in Switzerland you do not need to wait for the government to act on something, you can take matters into your own hands.   It's not even very hard, you don't need to run for office, you don't even have to have anything to do with politics. You simply get enough signatures within a specified timeframe, then you submit your proposal to the government, then it goes through a lot of administrative red tape, and finally the country as a whole votes on the text of the law. The government can't prevent it from happening, and the main challenge is getting the required number of signatures. Voting happens several times a year.  So if LGBT groups in Switzerland wanted to, they could easily put together such a popular initiative."

Switzerland,360ae7,Urgullibl,0,Fri May 15 17:10:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am aware that individuals can adopt, but the problem lies with the fact that joint adoption is reserved for married couples and gay people can't get married."
Switzerland,360ae7,Hello_Connor,2,Fri May 15 14:57:35 2015 UTC,"I think you're mixing up countries here. Switzerland might pride itself for its political system, but most certainly not for being a beacon for progress. The amount of time it takes to plan and build any big construction project for example is about the same time it takes other countries to build a new city. Switzerland is slow. Really slow. That's why this just hasn't really come up yet. I can't even tell you how the population would vote on the issue, though I suspect marriage would pass easily while adoption might be a close one."

Switzerland,35zebo,immab123,3,Thu May 14 20:11:34 2015 UTC,"Not sure if they have Kayaks, but they have pedalos (boats where you pedal to get around) in Faulensee (a village next to spiez, which is between Interlaken and Thun). Although, I don't want to discourage you from kayaking, but I live at the lake of thun (the lake to the left of Interlaken) and the lake is really big to get around. There are a lot of boats and the streaming will bring you to Thun (the lake of Thun flows to the River of the aare in thun), so that is another challenge when Kayaking. here is my idea for you:  Day one, go to Kandersteg. (you only have to change trains in Berne, 1.5h with the train). When you arrive in Kandersteg, you can hike up to the Lake Oeschinen. pics. It's one of my favourite places in the area. And not too crowded! you can go down with a little cable railway. You find the hike routes on the following site. link.  You return to thun and sleep in a hostel. on day 2, you spend the morning in the city (there is a beautiful castle with an awesome view and there are also some other hidden spots with beautiful views or places I could tell you. On noon, you get to the Aare (river) and rent one of the following pieces and go down the Aare to get back to Bern. They take your stuff with a car to bern where you leave the river  and they give you your stuff back and you give them the tube. By the way, if you choose the tube (the round thing), you start in Uttigen, which is like 10 minutes with the train from thun, because there is a big wave in Uttigen which is too dangerous with this small thing. pic.  I absolutely love going down the aare, picture from yesterday. :D It will probably look like this. not too crowded, but it's cool to just float around with random people and have a chat with them.  I admit, you won't see Interlaken with my plan, but to be honest it's just a really small city that sells overly expensive souvenirs and isn't really worth visiting. It's kinda cheesy. You'll see more Indian and Asian people in Interlaken than people from Interlaken.   Also with my idea, you get both the hike and a bit of water action. Tell me what you think!"

Switzerland,35zebo,musiu,1 point,Fri May 22 04:38:40 2015 UTC,"there is only one train, so there's not much of a choice. Just type the villages in here to see when they go. you go from burgdorf to Berne and in Berne you take the ""Lötschberger"", the green and rather short train on platform 4 or 5 if I remember correctly.  Something I forgot, if you find 2 hours somewhere (maybe in the early morning of day 1 or in the evening of day two, if you are not tired yet), check out bern, the capitol. I may be biased since I live here, but I think it's one of the most beautiful cities we have in Switzerland.  I wasn't in Kandersteg for a longtime, I'd be up for that totally! ""Unfortunately"" in June I have my last holidays before I have to go to the Army (yeah every guy in Switzerland has to do this...) and I'll be spending these days in Iceland, but maybe you can pm me the date when you're here?

Switzerland,35zebo,BilLELE,1 point,Fri May 22 06:03:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where you could rent a kayak, but I'd try directly at the lake. I know that they rent out rowboats in Brienz, no idea if they rent out kayaks too though.    While Burgdorf isn't a particularly interesting town, you have great train connections to other places. If you like hiking, Interlaken is a great hub. You can reach loads of cool places from there. If you want to wander around, browsing shops and sightsee, some of the bigger cities might be interesting. A couple of ideas:     Take the train from Burgdorf to Meiringen, either via Bern->Interlaken->Meiringen or Olten->Lucerne->Meiringen. The view from the train is quite scenic. In Meiringen you can take the cable car to Hasliberg where you have nice hiking trails. Bern or Lucerne. Both of these cities have beautiful old towns and a lot of opportunities to sight see. Lucerne especially is known as a ""must see"" for tourists with sights like the Kappelbrücke or the Lion Monument. Bern also has a beautiful old town with a lot of hidden shops and bars you could explore and if you get bored of that, just hang around one of the many parks and chill in the sun (depending on the weather of course).   That's all I got from the top of my head. In any case I'd suggest downloading the SBB app so you know exactly when and where all the trains go. If you have more questions I'll be happy to help.

I now live in the US, but I moved because I was open to it and, well, we wanted to be together, so we did what we had to do. We were older, though -- fresh out of college. 18 is young, you're not even done with college and neither is she, presumably. Of course you could go to school in Switzerland or she in the USA, but it's a big commitment, let alone immigrating here or there permanently.  I am biased but I like the idea of moving to Switzerland so you don't get enslaved by the loathsome US student loan system, since you have a choice now.  Anyway, you will have a hard time moving to Switzerland long-term unless you two are married. The reverse is also true, immigration to the USA is essentially impossible without marriage. If you enrolled in a Swiss school, then you'd have a way of staying for a while, but you'd have to have a source of income so you can show the government that you have the means to support yourself financially while living in Switzerland, and all bets are off once you graduate.  As for learning the language -- learning German is what you'll want to do. The official language is German, it's what's taught in schools, and everybody knows it. But as you probably know by now, Swiss German is the everyday language in social and business settings, so unfortunately you will want to learn both. You can get around fine with just ""regular"" German but you'll probably feel left out in social settings until you feel comfortable with Swiss German."

Switzerland,35yjao,USCgamecocks,-4,Fri May 15 16:59:37 2015 UTC,"The only tip I can give you is to make a decision on relinquishing your US citizenship as soon as possible if you decide to go through with it.  My grandfather followed by grandmother back to Switzerland after he met her while she was completing an apprenticeship in the US. He was in his early 20s. He completely assimilated to Swiss culture and is a complete Buenzlischwiizer, but his US taxes and relinquishing citizenship it, is a huge financial nightmare."
Switzerland,35yjao,silasoverturf,5,Thu May 14 17:24:37 2015 UTC,"That's a ridiculously short-sighted reason to relinquish US citizenship. Just wait for 2017, chances are things are gonna get better again."
Switzerland,35yjao,Urgullibl,2,Thu May 14 20:28:32 2015 UTC,"Are you just betting on Republican control, or is there something more specific in the works?"
Switzerland,35yjao,silasoverturf,1 point,Thu May 14 20:39:30 2015 UTC,"No, I'm betting on Obama's term ending, and even if the next president turns out to be a Dem, she is unlikely to be even remotely as hostile towards foreign accounts as he is."
Switzerland,35yjao,Urgullibl,5,Thu May 14 20:40:51 2015 UTC,"The US tax code, who states that US citizens will be taxed even if they live and work abroad, is unlikely to change or become unenforceable just because the president us changing. I do agree that renouncing his citizenship is the least of his worries, but it has very little to do with the POTUS."
Switzerland,35yjao,DeepBlueNemesis,2,Fri May 15 04:04:47 2015 UTC,"That is correct, but the executive has a lot of discretion on how they enforce it.  Obama really is the first Pres to make this a priority, and the next one probably will have different ones.  As an example of how much arbitrary discretion the POTUS really has, consider that marijuana is federally illegal and he chooses to not enforce that law."
Switzerland,35yjao,Urgullibl,2,Fri May 15 04:14:39 2015 UTC,"He doesn't need to relinquish it immediatly. It's a pretty permanent choice, so it might be better for him to wait until he settles down."

Switzerland,35ufcs,pascalbrax,3,Wed May 13 19:52:02 2015 UTC,If you're Japanese you only need a t-shirt and sneakers
Switzerland,35ufcs,Eldona,5,Thu May 14 07:53:05 2015 UTC,"Depends what you're planning to do exactly - proper alpine hiking or a tourism program with some mountains? May can be pretty hot in the city (in Zurich it was around 30°C yesterday and people were swimming in the river). But there is still a significant amount of snow in the mountains and it's still very cold. Titlis was 4°C today, so I would recommend more than just a hoodie. Jungfraujoch is more of a tourism site, not a place to hike really.   You can rent all sorts of jackets in the mountain villages if needed though."
Switzerland,35ufcs,vital8,2,Wed May 13 16:50:35 2015 UTC,"Apart from the mountain ranges, I think ill just be walking around the cities. My main concern however is still the warm clothing. Any specifications on Where is it possible to rent them out locally?  Also, is it better to buy the jackets/mittens/etc over there?"
Switzerland,35ufcs,Formagella,4,Wed May 13 17:03:53 2015 UTC,"don't buy, not worth it, just buy your own stuff before coming if buying is your intention (unless you're from some particular ultrawarm country where that clothing can't be found of course).   I don't know the price of rentals.   I would never go on a trip without a windbreaker. It's lightweight and works also when there's strong wind coupled with the rain and maybe you also have baggage with you, plus if coupled with hoodie and t-shirt it's enough to make me comfortable for temperatures around 10°C, but not lower.  For 4°C I would wear a winter jacket already, I don't use mittens or special thermal underwear or any of that stuff though so it may be different for you."
Switzerland,35ufcs,Formagella,1 point,Wed May 13 17:53:17 2015 UTC,"I'm from India, so warm clothing wouldn't do me any good. But if its available for a reasonable price, i wouldn't mind; but I don't think that's the case considering that things are quite expensive in Switzerland"
Switzerland,35ufcs,anonlymouse,2,Wed May 13 18:03:34 2015 UTC,"forget about reasonable price when you're in a tourist trap.   India has pretty cold places too AFAIK but I guess it doesn't apply to you.   Maybe you'll just have to rent a jacket if possible.   I guess you can bring several layers of clothing (jackets or whatever you have and several layers to go underneath) so you have that option just in case.   On Friday it's going to rain with temperatures down to 10°C even in the low-lying areas at least in the north (this is what the weather forecast says, I live in the south and temperatures aren't going to drop that much), May is not very consistent with temperatures, keep that in mind.   Use this website: http://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home.html?tab=overview it's the government weather agency and you can find temperature history, wind and forecasts for the mountains you want to visit in addition to cities."
Switzerland,35ufcs,vital8,1 point,Wed May 13 20:26:49 2015 UTC,Something like this should do the trick for you (especially given current weather). I like layering a fleece with a waterproof windbreaker and it handles everything pretty well (including Canadian winters as long as we're not talking -40 + wind chill).   You can also go to a Brockenhaus/Brocante and look for a used jacket at a reasonable price.
Switzerland,35ufcs,weirdbreh,2,Wed May 13 23:31:22 2015 UTC,"In the cities a hoodie will easily suffice. For the mountain ranges you'll definitely want to bring a jacket (check the corresponding website for specifics). But to be honest, I wouldn't go too high up the mountains anyway in May. That is, unless you like to hike in the snow. I'd recommend a program like the Lauterbrunnental and for mountain hiking, I'd go somewhere like Schreckfeld and walk down to Grindelwald. That way you get to see some nice mountains and won't be in the snow.   Well rental depends where you'll be staying. Just google something like ""Interlaken ski rental"" - there's a sports equipment rental place in pretty much any place that has a hotel.   I wouldn't recommend buying it just for a few days personally."
Switzerland,35txf5,GerardDenis,5,Wed May 13 14:05:51 2015 UTC,"Bonjour,  J'ai lu vos deux revues publiées à ce jour (Human Universe et Empty Hands, Open Arms). Ce sont les fautes d'orthographe qui m'ont le plus dérangé, je suis très pointilleux à ce sujet et ai depuis longtemps l'oeil pour les repérer. Je vous suggère donc d'y prêter une attention particulière lorsque vous écrivez, et peut-être de faire relire vos textes par une tierce personne avant leur publication, si vous en avez la possibilité. Je sais par expérience qu'on est malheureusement plus susceptible de manquer lors de la relecture ses propres fautes de style ou d'orthographe, tandis que l'avis de quelqu'un d'autre permet souvent d'identifier ces erreurs.  Je n'en suis bien sûr pas moi-même à l'abri, a fortiori car expatrié et vivant dans un pays non francophone, j'ai perdu de la pratique du français oral comme écrit et n'ai plus toute l'aisance verbale de l'époque de mes études, qui remontent à dix ans environ. Autrement dit, je ne suis ni critique littéraire, ni prof de français, je ne prétends pas être parfait, mais vous vouliez du feedback, alors voilà... :)  Conscient que vous êtes québécois -- je m'en doutais à la lecture de votre blog et l'ai confirmé via Whois de votre nom de domaine -- je ne dirai rien quant à votre style ou quant à certains choix de mots ou de tournures, car je sais bien que le français québécois, bien que français, est différent à certains égards du français de l'Ancien monde que je parle, et je l'accepte sans arrière-pensée. L'orthographe française, en revanche, ne varie pas, je vous réitère donc ma suggestion d'y prêter une attention particulière!  Pour en venir au fond et non à la forme de vos revues, je dirais qu'elles constituent de bons résumés de ces livres. Je ne les ai pas lus, je ne peux donc pas en dire davantage, mais puisque votre audience sera présumément composée de gens comme moi qui n'ont pas lu ces livres, il me semble que leur résumé est adéquat.   Je dois dire, par contre, que la critique des livres me laisse un peu sur ma faim, mais je ne sais pas trop comment vous expliquer pourquoi sans paraître hautain, c'est un de mes défauts, j'espère donc que vous ne m'en tiendrez pas rigueur car je suis plein de bonnes intentions.  Peut-être trouvé-je vos critiques trop simplistes; j'aimerais que la critique aille plus en profondeur, mais ne puis vous dire avec précision dans quelle direction. Peut-être avez-vous vous-même une certaine connaissance des sujets abordés, et peut-être en avez-vous élaboré une opinion personnelle que vous puissiez opposer à celles mises en avant dans les livres.  Ou encore, peut-être avez-vous lu d'autres livres ou vu d'autres films dont les sujets se rapprochent du sujet de votre article, de sorte que vous pourriez les comparer de diverses manières (qualité de la présentation, don de persuasion/charisme de l'auteur, méthode scientifique s'il en est, etc.).  Par comparaison, quand je lis la critique d'un film (j'avoue ne pas lire de critiques littéraires, d'où mon choix d'exemple), j'attends de l'auteur qu'il ou elle soit bien au fait du cinéma en tant qu'art, et s'il s'agit d'un documentaire, a fortiori scientifique, que l'auteur possède des connaissances en lien avec le sujet dudit documentaire.  De façon globale, je trouve souvent que les critiques professionnels sont prétentieux et pénibles, mais ça n'engage que moi. Ceci pour dire qu'il existe un équilibre entre une critique simpliste et une critique prétentieuse, et c'est là que je voulais en venir: peut-être pourriez-vous chercher à approfondir un peu votre critique en puisant dans vos connaissances préalables d'un sujet X abordé par tel ou tel livre.  En bref, puisque vous êtes géographe de formation, sans doute les sujets des deux articles publiés à ce jour vous tiennent-ils à coeur, je vous suggère donc de vous servir de votre formation et de vos expériences pour aiguiser et approfondir votre critique lorsque vous en avez les moyens. Vous l'avez déjà fait dans une modeste mesure, mais je pense qu'il serait judicieux d'analyser un peu plus en profondeur.   Par exemple, vous pourriez vous étendre sur le contexte que vous connaissez des sujets abordés par les livres afin de sensibiliser le lecteur sur ledit contexte. Votre critique du livre sur le Congo et les chimpanzés bonobos est lacunaire: il n'y est fait qu'une allusion indirecte à ce qui menace le chimpanzé bonobo dans son habitat naturel. Je connais personnellement le problème, mais il est fort probable que votre lecteur moyen n'en connaîtra pas grand chose. Il n'est même pas garanti que le lecteur moyen sache qu'il existe une différence entre le chimpanzé commun et le chimpanzé bonobo, ou même qu'il sache concrètement ce qu'est un chimpanzé, et non un orang-outang ou un gorille, pour citer les autres grands singes. Ils sont certes très différents les uns des autres mais tout le monde ne le sait pas.   Bien sûr je ne vous dis pas d'expliquer au lecteur ce qu'est un chimpanzé ou un bonobo, mais une fois encore, il serait judicieux d'évoquer dans les grandes lignes ce qui fait que les bonobos sont menacés ainsi que les enjeux des programmes de conservation et les problèmes qu'ils rencontrent, plutôt que d'y faire indirectement allusion sans s'inquiéter de la connaissance du sujet par le lecteur. Cela servirait à mieux mettre l'objet du livre en perspective.  Bon, je m'en tiens là, je vois sans me relire dans le détail que j'ai pondu une tartine de texte bien au-delà de ce que je m'imaginais au départ; la verbosité est aussi un de mes défauts... J'espère quoi qu'il en soit que vous trouverez mon commentaire utile!"

J'ai été très surpris du commentaire sur l'orthographe et je suis donc allé réviser mes textes. Semblerait-il qu'une erreur soit survenue lors de la publication et que j'ai mis en ligne, pour une raison et d'un façon inconnue, l'avant dernière version de mes articles / celle avant la correction. Je vais vérifier s'il est question d'un bug ou d'une erreur humaine.   Pour le style de la critique, je suis encore en réflexion à savoir le niveau de détail et de profondeur, mais j'aime l'idée de puiser dans mes connaissances de façon plus approfondie.

Architects should be forced to spend a few months in other countries to learn how to build cool high rises. :/ But In the end I personally still prefer this over yet another four story cube the rest of the city is being plastered with."

I once saw how they do it.

I just find it interesting to use natural things to cure minor things. If I'm a bit stressed I'm not gonna take a pill, I'll drink a chamomile tea or something. If I'm anxious I'd probably just have a peppermint or lemon balm tea or something rather than immediately go to chemical medicine. If I'm a bit sick I'll take a really spicy soup. However if you get into more hard pains and illnesses, ya medicine me up"
Switzerland,35r66l,SwissBliss,3,Wed May 13 14:52:31 2015 UTC,"There is an herb to treat headaches: willow tree bark. Its active ingredient was isolated and improved, and now we call that aspirin.  ""Chemical medicine"" does not make sense, everything is chemical. Here is a description of stuff that makes up a banana, for instance.  There's no reason to use placebos (""a really spicy soup"" isn't going to heal anything) when you can use real stuff. Taking an aspirin every few weeks/months because you have a headache isn't going to leave any residue or whatever."
Switzerland,35r66l,Aethec,3,Wed May 13 15:18:21 2015 UTC,"Well let's not be too pedantic, yes everything is chemical, but some things are found in nature and others are found in tiny white powder pills made in labs.   I've never heard spicy food described as placebos. Ginger and a hot soup clears sinuses and provides relief, just like steam baths and such. I personally don't like taking really concentrated pills like aspirin, when I can simply have a nice tea from some Swiss mountain herbs and such, IF it's a minor thin. People are way too quick to take a pill at every slight pain, and doctors get a ton of cash from basically prescribing it for everything.   My whole stance is: If it's minor, take some herbs, spicy food, drink lots of water, make certain changes like moving to a dry region and stuff like that. If it's major fucking take some hard medicine and get it fixed. Don't get me wrong I'm not an anti medication guy, I just think that there's a lot you can do before going for hard medication that you can overdose on if taken too much (of course no one reasonable would overdose, but it just shows that it isn't exactly very healthy to pop some pills for anything)"
Switzerland,35r66l,SwissBliss,1 point,Wed May 13 16:58:28 2015 UTC,"Well let's not be too pedantic, yes everything is chemical, but some things are found in nature and others are found in tiny white powder pills made in labs.   And that makes absolutely no difference. Natural things aren't safer, better, or healthier. The difference between natural ""cures"" and medicine is that medicine is tested for safety and efficacy. If something natural seems to work at curing some disease, it gets tested, the active ingredient(s) are extracted, and then labs synthesize them. The result is the exact same thing at the molecular level.   People are way too quick to take a pill at every slight pain, and doctors get a ton of cash from basically prescribing it for everything.   Producers of natural ""remedies"" like herbal teas, as well as alternative medicine, also make a ton of cash from it. Boiron, the most well-known homeopathic ""laboratory"", has a net revenue of 90,000,000€. Not bad for selling sugar pills.   I just think that there's a lot you can do before going for hard medication that you can overdose on if taken too much (of course no one reasonable would overdose, but it just shows that it isn't exactly very healthy to pop some pills for anything)   You can also overdose on water (not-so-fun fact: that has actually happened, at ""drink as much as you can"" contests). I just ate delicious Älpermagronen, I'd die if I ate way too much of them. Everything has a dose at which humans die, that doesn't mean taking small amounts is a problem. The problematic substances are the ones that stay in your body for a very long time since small doses build up, and we don't use these as medicine... alternative medicine like ayurveda does (heavy metal intoxication, anyone?."
Switzerland,35r66l,Aethec,1 point,Wed May 13 18:16:53 2015 UTC,"It does make a difference though. One is a natural dose of an ingredient, and the other is a heavy unnatural dose. If I'm slightly sick, I'd rather take the normal as-it-came dose.  I'm not talking about homeopathy, I'm just talking about non-manmade remedies for small illnesses, like lemon balm for anxiety, peppermint for stomach aches, spicy food or steam baths to clear sinuses.  We shouldn't act like pills and medication are 100% natural at base and super safe. They have tons of secondary effects and even sometimes makes a person more sick. I won't take hard medication for a small problem when there's lots of stuff I can do at home to help."
Switzerland,35r66l,SwissBliss,2,Wed May 13 19:55:06 2015 UTC,"One is a natural dose of an ingredient   Natural? You can't seriously be saying that the dose in a tea bag is natural... it's just whatever dose tastes good given the average tea cup size.  By the way, do you know what comes in ""natural doses"", too? Bitter almonds. Eight of them is enough cyanide to kill you. Hemlock. Just a small dose and you're dead. Belladonna. Pretty berries... eat two and die. Amanita phalloides. Half of one is lethal. Box jellyfishes. Touching one means death. Nature is filled with stuff that kills you.   and the other is a heavy unnatural dose   It's a dose tailored to cure whatever the medicine cures. If that happens to be more than nature, so what? Whenever you eat food like saffron or pine nuts, you're also eating ""heavy unnatural doses"".   We shouldn't act like pills and medication are 100% natural at base and super safe.   We don't. They are tested for both safety and efficiency before they're allowed to be sold.   They have tons of secondary effects and even sometimes makes a person more sick.   Everything has secondary effects. A friend of mine risks death if he merely touches a carrot, a stalk of celery, and a bunch of other things; make him a soup with vegetable broth and he'll die before finishing the plate if he doesn't have his (unnatural!) medicine with him.   I won't take hard medication for a small problem when there's lots of stuff I can do at home to help.   Aspirin isn't hard medication. And unlike your home remedies, it's been shown to work and to be safe.     This page is a pretty good - though a bit over-the-top - essay on the subject."

It has an amazing view and you can do that hike for about 30Fr. in transportation costs. Take the train to Küssnacht, the bus Nr 2 to Küssnacht, Seilbahn, take the small cablecar/tramway up to Seeboden. From there it takes about an hour to Rigi staffel and a bit more to Rigi Kulm aka Queen of the mountains (1800 m). From there you can walk down again (some other way if you want) to Seeboden where you can take the cablecar."

It's around 3h from either Kriens or Hergiswil to Fräkmüntegg. There you can still decide what to do next. Go to the top? Same way back? A roundtrip? Use a cable car to go up or down (fares). Up to Fräkmüntegg you walk through the woods mostly with some nice views occasionally, so you are well protected from rain and wind. You can print maps and make GPS-Tracks with this website.   Thoughts on your link: From Dietschiberg you have a great view over Lucerne. From Sonneberg your view is mostly limited to Kriens and Horw (IMO less spectacular than Dietschiberg). But the trails are kinda cool there. Don't forget to pass by Chateau Gütsch if you go for Sonneberg. It's scenic there.   If you stay close to Lucerne (Pilatus, Sonneberg, Dietschiberg) I recommend to buy a Day Pass for Public Transport (Zone 10). That's 6 bucks and you can ride Buses and Trains to and from all this destinations.   Hope that helps."

Switzerland,35mwql,mobus,1 point,Tue May 12 18:28:03 2015 UTC,"I'll try to answer all these points:   1: adjust from the lack of revenue from the wealthy:  I have to say, that I don't really catch how this part of your answer respond to my particular comment, but, yes if the rich were to go (in an other country with lower taxes pex, government would probably have to either :  A limit governmental budget (cut sprendings).  B rise taxes(on people, enterprises, goods) to put up with the losses.  C be in deficit and let the debt rise.  sadly :   A: rather unusual (I wouldn't be against it personnaly) but it would mean the diminution of lots of government spendings (welfaire system, etc), yes the army would probably also suffer, but it is only 10% of the federal budget. We shouldn't forget that the cantons would suffer the most (because they touch the taxes on the fortune) and they have no army to throw out.  B: rise taxes : just for the entreprises isn't the solution, they would probably leave too, so individuals : but the ones that can't really go, so just more poor peoples.  C is actually not the best option because of the globalised world we live in, the people that would lend money to the government wouldn't lend us money undeterminely, and, once a certain level is atteigned you have to devaluate your national money (to pay less to the people (rich and middle class) that borrowed you money) sadly that also has an influence on the general prices of goods in the country (because we live in a globalised world). so yes, not the best.  so yes, loosing the richest in this country would do us no good on a taxation level (without speaking the wealth they create, by creating jobs (lots of people in luxus industry and services). see the situation of france trying to forbid their fortunes to leave the country.  2: buying government.  In switzerland ?? you really think our grey faded member of the federal council are bought off ??  Well, you may be right, no actual proof that bribery is still a thing, but I'm sure that the country would benefice if you were to give us (to the press ? the people) real proof (or at least a way to look in). Entreprises have a role to play with governmental and parlemental work, legislation drafts, and so on, so have worker unions, left wing parties, consumer associations. If you think that some laws shouldn't pass, go ahead, draft a referendum, it's fairly easy.  3: majors cuts in military spending well, military isn't that big in switzerland, and spending less would mean less money for the auxiliary work the military does for the authorities: in case of big manifestations, emergencies, disasters and so on. money that someone would have to find somewhere else...  4: army being counter intuitive I can't agree with you, defending one's population has always meant (still today in the irak, afganistan conflict) being able to defend the population against the destruction, the rapes, the burglaries the horrors that any other power would do if they were to enter the  country (because yes the threats exist, we live 40h away from syria by car, we sit on the largest water reserve in europe, and are quite privilegied on an economical level). so yes, I believe that the necessecity of an army is and probably always will be there.  even if it is only to come to help the civil authorities in cases of catastrophies : when the firemens or the police can't help, because they don't have enough people for enought time (after 36 hours uninterupted of any police mission (with people needed all the time) the army will be called in, to provide mens and help.  4: a circle where the countries would fight to win the rich people over.  yes : they will, and it is the goal, we live in a free world, in a free market, which can be called capitalism (neo-liberalism for certain peoples) with a welfare system, which means that we tend to the poors... what swizerland does (we might not do enough but we do some if not plenty). the only way you could change the system would be :   A : forbid certain peoples - that have commited no crime other than having worked all their lives (like the ancien boss of UBS wo began with an apprentisship (lehre/apprentissage)) or that have the chance to have had parents/ancestors that did the same - to leave the country: held them prisonner in a way, which is constitutive in my opinion of a auritarian state, a dictature.  or B : change the system, make the revolution and get us out of the capitalist system, sadly the last experiment has gone rogue... and some argue that they had it in their gene, in the exact theory of the system. edit 1,2: formatting"

I mean, just look at portugal: Their MwSt is at 24%.  And no, bigger MwSt on more expensive things doesnt solve it either. Thats contraproductive if anything. We have a good Tax system right now, the problem is the people are investing it in the wrong places. Luxury Apartments? Sure, i think 50% of them are empty nowadays? And then they want to additionaly Tax the rich guys.  Start by making affordable apartments for normal people instead of making apartments for wealthy people who could rather buy a house with the rent you want them to pay"

Switzerland,35mwql,anonlymouse,5,Tue May 12 08:58:42 2015 UTC,"A nice story on the subject:  let us imagin that every day, 10 friends go for a drink in a pub, the bill is 100.- every night, which would make 10.- per person. But the friends had decided to split up the bill in a proportional manner, a bit like the taxes. which gave something like that : *the first 4 paid nothing (the 4 poorest) *the fifth would pay 1.- *the sithy 3.- *the seventh 7.- *the eighth 12.- *the neinth 18.- *the tenth 59.- (because he was really rich)  they were all fairly happy with the situation, until one day the bar tender, trying to be nice, placed them in front of a big problem, he said:   ""since you're all good clients, I will make you a 20.- discount for tonight, so your 10 beers will cost you only 80.- "" the group decided to pay the new bill with the same repartition than they did before and just soustract the same amount by the others. the first 4 would continue to drink for free, and they would split up the 20.- by 6, which ment 3.33.- discount for every one of them. But the 5ht and the 6th would then have to be paid to have a drink. So the bar tender proposed that the 20.- discount should be split proportionnaly to what the people already paid.  so he did the math :   *the 5th, like the 4 first one, paid nothing *the 6th paid 2.- instead of 3.- (33% discount) *the 7th paid 5.- instead of 7.- (28% discount) *the 8th paid 9.- instead of 12.- (25% discount) *the 9th paid 14.- instead of 18.- (22% discount) *the 10th paid 50.- instead of 59.- (16% discount) the biggest amounth of reduction (but not percentage wise)  every one of the 6 that paid, paid less than the evenings before, and the 4 that didn't payed anyway continued to drink for free.  But once outside of the Bar, everybody compared how much he had saved: ""I had only 1.- on the 20.- discount"" said the 6th, he showed the 10th and said ""he, he had 9.-"". the 5th agreed, ""I too had only 1.- savings"".  the 7th intervened and said "" its right !! why would he have the right to have 9.- when I just had 2.- ?? the richer had the biggest discount"".  ""wait a minute"" said the first one, ""there are four of us that had nothing, this payment system is really against the poors"", the 9 other guys encircled the 10th and insulted him.  The next evening, the 10th guy (the richest) didn't show up. the 9 others sat down, drank their beers without him. But when the Bill arrived, they noticed that they didn't have enough money to pay even half of the Bill...  The moral of this story dear redditors: our tax system is fairly complicated, we don't really try to understand the numbers, but none of us should forget that for the rich are the ones that help the machine turn. So stop screaming against the rich, stop asking to tax just the others, drink a bear and enjoy it!  the source (in french, there might be an original source somewhere but I couldn't find it (neither the web site where I found it))"
Switzerland,35mwql,mobus,6,Tue May 12 14:53:02 2015 UTC,"This is a very misleading title and article.  In reality, the wealth gap isn't people of different class, but people of different ages, at different stages of their lifes.    During the normal course of a productive life, the average person starts modestly, has barely enought money for school, and eats for cheap.  When the former student starts working, he may contract debts, or have to pay previous debts.  When the house is paid off, the worker will put some money aside to live a confortable elder life, and whatever wealth is left when he dies should go where he desires it to go, and nowhere else.

They've been publicly exposed by Kassensturz and other consumer-protection outlets.  Now, the most important thing here is that Intrum Justitia is a private company without any official traction. ""Credit score"" is not really so relevant here, as long as it does not involve the official path, which is a ""Betreibung"" which you'd receive from your local Betreibungsamt. Private debt collectors like Intrum are notorious for maintaining incorrect data of people with apparently bad payment habits.  When you say Mobility, you mean the car-sharing service, right? Generally, I'd give them a call, tell them that the information from Intrum Justitia is incorrect. Tell them you're in the process of getting this rectified and that you never received a Betreibung or anything of the sort (if that's accurate). Ask them what they'd like you to provide to remediate this situation. I assume they want to do business, so they should be able to tell you how to make it happen...  Additional tip for Intrum: You're not legally required to pay any ""Verzugsschaden"" or similarly labelled items on their bill.

Switzerland,35ghlx,nowistime6,11,Sun May 10 03:06:35 2015 UTC,"I'd say the only real common ground is politics, and in that regard most Swiss have a rather strong sense of freedom and federalism, except for the outer left wing. The mentality of being responsible for one self, the canton being responsible for itself, and the federation being a helpful instance that has to be kept from getting too power-hungry.  This mentality spreads into all kinds of life's situations. Thus also the ""I mind my own business, and so should you"" thing that's so often stated about us."

That principle is called ""Subsidiarity"" and it is literally the 5th article in our constitution (5a to be precise):  Bei der Zuweisung und Erfüllung staatlicher Aufgaben ist der Grundsatz der Subsidiarität zu beachten.   Followed by article 6:  Jede Person nimmt Verantwortung für sich selber wahr und trägt nach ihren Kräften zur Bewältigung der Aufgaben in Staat und Gesellschaft bei.   Articles 1-5 define the confederation and its purpose, fix official languages and commit to a constitutional state. Article 6 concludes the general provisions, followed by fundamental rights. You can't have it more extreme than that, it's right in the definition of what we consider a constitutional state and comes even before basic human rights. Great comment!"

They are extremely friendly and warm, but with my Vaud car plates I feel like a foreigner when I go visit family there, and if you pass through villages in the mountains I promise the entire village will look at you pass by through windows or along the streets, since even Swiss people from other cantons are foreigners haha  Vaud: Pretty normal people to me. I'd say Vaud is the most balanced canton in terms of Swiss-Foreigner lifestyles and such. Maybe it's cause I've lived here my whole life, but people here are pretty much normal. I'd love to know if people from other cantons have opinions on the Vaudois. It's kind of a middle ground between Geneva and Valais  Swiss german areas: A lot of my family is from there, but I wouldn't say I am. Whenever I go there I feel a little uncomfortable.

But maybe it's just my own impression.    On the minus side: let's not get noticed, mind our own business, sometimes hide behind the rules (of politeness or hierarchy in the professional setting for example). Nobody can tell us what to do and how to deal with our stuff; I've found this particularly true, both on the personal side (won't take shit that's unasked for) and more generally on the political side (Europe and their rules: lol). Actually, that might be a good thing sometimes.   On the plus side: honest, hard-working people with a strong sense of solidarity for those they consider their kins (from family to friends to the whole nation, possibly in that order). A good taste for alcohol, love of nature, simplicity and generosity, a strong sense of tradition and respect for our own history, and therefore a lot of respect for the traditions and history of others--provided they don't mess with ours.   A good example of this sense of solidarity and ""greater good"" is how on many occasions people have voted for an increase of taxes. Oh yes, on the plus side: actual, true democracy in its direct form, lasting for 720+ years and counting.   And a good deal of humor. For those who understand French :)"

But I would take the train to somewhere else if I were you.   Interlaken is a bit of a tourist trap but the scenery is great and lots of much nicer places are accessible in very short amounts of time. If you're up for mountainous stuff, hiking etc. I can recommend you the Niesen, the Brienzer Rothorn or, if you want to be REALLY overwhelmed by the mountains, the Jungfrau Region. The old town of Thun is also worth a visit, or you can just take part in some of the activities the two lakes have to offer, like swimming, water skiing, wakeboarding etc.  Other cool places in Switzerland where there's a lot to do for tourists:    Luzern Appenzell Valais the Jura (very underrated tourist destination IMO) Zurich the whole Lake Geneva Region    etc etc etc."

Good night/social life for the same reasons and close to Carouge which is also a ""cool"" part of town. Weekend market in the main square, and usually some sort of circus/fair/activity as well.  Cons:   Not as convenient as the Old Town in terms of transportation. Some sketchy parts (drug dealers/gypsies). Loud for the reasons mentioned above. Crazy drivers (motos/cars) compared to the Old City which has super narrow roads or public transport roads only.  Vielle Ville  Pros:  Fantastic transportation options : Seemingly every line to everywhere in the city along with multiple options to the Train station. Walking distance to the lake. Cleaner/""Safer"" and quieter than the rest.   Cons:  More expensive. Expect a 15-20% markup on food/drinks. Can be a ghost town, and has parts where the streets aren't well lit, and not too many people would be around. Depending on the apt, you could possibly have to walk up/down hills each day."

Switzerland,34zj48,Rodaz32,12,Tue May 5 21:21:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you're comparing to, but it doesn't strike me as that different from Denmark, where I grew up.  Basically, any road in countries with really cold winter weather will need serious maintenance frequently. Cars driving on the road causes tiny cracks in the asphalt, and water seems into them, and as you might know, water expands when freezing, which causes the cracks to become deeper and wider. This leads to potholes and other problems.  Additionally, lots of traffic, especially heavy traffic like trucks cause a lot of wear as well.   A modern road is composed of several layers of asphalt (which is usually a mix of bitumen and stone chips/gravel of varying sizes). Topmost is a layer with fine stones, which handles wear from tires (that is, friction damage) better, since the chunks that inevitably gets torn off are smaller. However, this layer handles weight poorly, since it is easily deformed, so it's usually only a few centimetres thick. Below is one or more layers of bigger-grained asphalt, which handles the weight better. However, this layer handles friction really poorly, and is unpleasant to drive on.  So road engineers try to find a balance between having the top layer be thick enough to not wear out too quickly, but also not so thick that it deforms too much - you see this on old roads, where the there's two clear depressions in the road surface where the wheels of cars usually are.  There are different strategies to tackle this, but it basically breaks down to a three-way tug between road quality (ie. smooth surface, low-noise roads), maintenance frequency and costs. It's hard to say whether the Swiss dispositions in this regard are reasonable without diving really deep into their maintenance and construction programmes."

On that note: You guys hear about the guy that started painting dicks on potholes to force the local government to fix them?"
Switzerland,34zj48,huazzy,3,Wed May 6 08:01:16 2015 UTC,"Sadly, this level of maintenance is what it takes for perfect roads.   Go for a drive in Italy within a city (the motorways are usually decent) and see the difference for yourself. There IF they do it (which is not a given) they just sit on a truck and a guy on it throws hot asphalt in the pot holes. Of course it's not the normal asphalt so after a few months the hole is dug again. The roads are not level either.   In Switzerland, they close down the whole road, cut out a piece of asphalt, put in the new one, put the black glue to connect it and prevent new holes (you can usually see those black lines on the roads or at train stations) etc.  and it's all pricey.   Maybe there's a middle ground that would work better.  Still, the A2 is used by so many vehicles that my canton is sentenced to driving on a constant construction site regardless.   From Lugano onwards it's 80 km/h for so many kilometers right now."

Switzerland,34q429,DeepDuh,19,Sun May 3 15:44:13 2015 UTC,"Right, the article does not explain how complicated it is to get a ticket from Tokyo to Hiroshima however, it just covers the machines and the user flow of a metro ticket or of the local JR trains.  It's more equivalent to ZVV than SBB.  The Swiss system actually is rather unique that you pay a fixed price going from A to B (maybe it depends a bit on which route you take, but usually it doesn't), while in many other systems it also matters what kind of train you take and at what time you take it. See ICE Zuschlag in Germany or the extra fee for different Shinkansen trains in Japan.  I don't know about you guys, but here in Switzerland I can just sit in any train that has written Zürich HB on it somewhere as long as I have a ticket for Zürich, but in Japan I have to check if it's the right train first. Maybe I can only sit in a Hikari train, but not in a Nozomi train.  Also we have the concepts of zones here. As long as I stay in the urban zone of Zürich, I need a Zone10 ticket and that's it, I can go anywhere. Same goes for all the other cities and even rural areas work like this. In Japan every single metro station has a different price. I have to count if I go 3, 4 or maybe 5 stops until I reach my goal and have to choose the price of my ticket accordingly. Same in rural areas with buses.  Granted, the Japanese system is very convenient as well. Trains are always on time and they always stop exactly at their designated line. The doors always open at the same spot. I can literally stand exactly on the spot on the platform where the doors of the car with my reserved seat will be when the train arrives. In Switzerland there is always a little bit of a search involved when it comes to reserved seats and people are spread all over the platform and cluster around the doors, while in Japan everybody stands in a perfect line in front of the doors."
Switzerland,34q429,P1r4nha,2,Sun May 3 17:09:56 2015 UTC,In Switzerland all us commuters know precisely where each door opens too and we form lines. You seem to be taking your trains with amateurs.

Switzerland,34q429,sbetschi12,2,Mon May 4 10:06:41 2015 UTC,"The thing to understand though (which the article doesn't cover well) ist that in Japan, when doing your everyday commute, all you need to deal with in terms of the machines is charging your value card (which is just as quick as getting those metro tickets). These RFID cards are super convenient and I'd wish to have such a thing in Switzerland as well. In fact, in Switzerland it would be conceptually easier since, as you pointed out, we have a fixed A-to-B price, meaning that you'd never have to 'sign out' and 'sign in' again for different operators when you switch trains as in Japan (which is just holding the card in the proximity of a scanner, i.e. people walk through at normal speeds). The main cost for introducing such a system for SBB would be to put barriers at all access points for trains - quite an investment, but when you see how smoothly everything goes in Japan I'd reckon it would be worth it in the long run - at least they'd safe on all the controllers plus there'd be way less ticketing fraud."
Switzerland,34q429,enenra,4,Sun May 3 18:00:21 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make any sense. The way you use the ticket machines in Japan doesn't have anything to do with the kind of tickets offered. There is nothing stopping SBB from introducing the same kind of pay-as-you-go card that exists in Japan too. In fact, we have that: The Mehrfahrtenkarte. Except it's made out of paper.  The ticket machines in Japan are an antiquated nightmare to use. Not to mention that they at most support one additional language, and not even that is guaranteed.  Not to mention, btw., that the Swiss system of just having a yearly ticket that you never have to charge is superior to the rechargeable-thing anyway."

I think some stat said that nearly 94 or 96% of ZVV users had valid tickets. I don't know to what extent it would hold in Japan, but even a 4% loss would be significant loss of revenue, especially since Tokyo ferries about the population of Switzerland every single day on its subway!"
Switzerland,34q429,Iylivarae,1 point,Mon May 4 14:58:39 2015 UTC,"The ticket machines in Japan are an antiquated nightmare to use.   Could you give an example? Never had a bad experience with them. Put money in, press one button, take your ticket and leave. Maybe you mean finding the price was difficult? That's what was largely solved by the prepaid cards. And no these aren't equivalent to 'Mehrfahrtenkarte' - you can use them on any bus, train and metro except Shinkansen, for any route you want to take. I.e. I never have to care about ticketing at all where ever I want to go - just keep the card charged and scan it at entry & exit (impossible to forget since there's a barrier)."
Switzerland,34q429,riverguardian,2,Sun May 3 20:56:48 2015 UTC,"If I'm commuting everyday, it's just very convenient to have a GA or a local pass (Libero, ZVV, whatever). I don't even have to take the ticket out (that's what I hate about the barrier thing in London, f.e.), I keep the GA in my wallet, and if someone wants to see it, that's the time I take it out. But then I am usually comfortably seated and it doesn't bother me at all."
Switzerland,34q429,P1r4nha,2,Sun May 3 20:39:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, I totally agree with that. Subscriptions is something largely missing in Japan, probably because train operators simply don't have to. In a system where you mostly have to pay individually, an efficient ticketing system is just a necessity. Imagine Shinjuku, the world's largest station with 3M+ commuters a day passing through, if everyone of these would have to buy a ticket at a ZVV machine. Swiss trains are very convenient and cheap for commuters - but they're also not that profitable."

I like to compare these things between different countries as well and Japan and Switzerland are two of my most favorite countries when it comes to public transportation.  I saw you mentioned BART in your article. I found the machines I used horribly complicated (but maybe not all stations have the same machines). Pressing 'add' and 'subtract' buttons until I reach the desired amount for my ticket is really not user friendly."
Switzerland,34q429,P1r4nha,12,Mon May 4 16:07:04 2015 UTC,"The unique input mechanism featured in the Paris Metro system is the roll bar, which lets users scroll up and down the UI.   This person has clearly never attempted to use one of those godamn annoying piece of shit machines in the Paris Metro. Whoever came up with that terrible, terrible scroll bar needs a kick and then prosecution for wasting everyone's time.   What the sbb is doing now is more sensible   enable ticket purchases via mobile app avoiding the need to stand in front of a machine and wait for 50 tourists to stop fucking around.

Switzerland,34q429,alexrng,10,Mon May 4 14:59:50 2015 UTC,"even today, credit cards are not accepted for payment   Yeah, no thanks."
Switzerland,34q429,oelsen,2,Sun May 3 16:51:04 2015 UTC,"Yea, that may sound strange, but in Japan you are forced to keep enough cash in your pockets anyway - you deal with much more 'mom-and-pop' kind of stores that have been driven out of the market in the Western world for quite some time now, in Japan's big cities they're alive and well. If I can choose between having that variety and not needing cash, I'll choose the former any day."
Switzerland,34q429,Kempeth,3,Sun May 3 17:52:07 2015 UTC,"Except Japan has just as many issues with large chains driving small stores out of business as any other country. And besides that, I highly doubt that it has anything to do with cash payment. Payment by credit card is just generally not that prevalent in Japan. That doesn't mean small stores don't offer the option in Japan. Much less in Switzerland, where pretty much any shop has the option to pay with credit card. Size doesn't really matter."
Switzerland,34q429,roscocoltrane,2,Sun May 3 19:28:05 2015 UTC,"I meant it the other way round - Japan has still many small stores, many of them too small to deal with credit cards, thus why you need cash more than in CH. It's not because you pay cash that Japan has many small stores. Japan may have large chains putting pressure on them, but at least this has progressed much less from what I can tell. Maybe it has to do with demographics as well - more mom and pops (both as owners and as customers) means more mom-and-pop stores. Maybe it's because they're better organized. Maybe it's because the market for customers-on-foot is just much bigger, both because of city sizes and because the percentage of people taking the train is even higher. Maybe it's because land is so expensive, so larger stores are only profitable right in the center of things, not in residential areas. Of course the combinis have removed most of the small retailers for everyday things, but there's still all kinds of specialty trade and tons of small restaurants and cafes everywhere."

Switzerland,34pc1w,IotaCandle,8,Sun May 3 09:06:11 2015 UTC,"Just so you're not surprised when you get here, Switzerland is extremely expensive. It's probable that a shooting trip here would cost more than just buying a gun in Belgium."
Switzerland,34pc1w,RagingOrangutan,5,Sun May 3 10:37:58 2015 UTC,"In order to buy a gun in Belgium, I need to * Be a member of a shooting club for at least a year (€130/year) * Have a paper from the doctor that says I'm sane (€50) * pay €100 for the paperwork * go trought min. 6 months of waiting periods and paperwork * buy a safe (police can check at any time) * pass a theorical and practical exam  plus, guns in Belgium are never less expensive than in Switzerland, because of all the regulations on it.  There is no ""easier to buy"" firearms since 2006.  The infrastructures are also shit."
Switzerland,34pc1w,RagingOrangutan,6,Sun May 3 10:45:43 2015 UTC,"OK, so that's 280 euros plus the cost of gun and safe. How much do you think it will cost for you to travel to and from Switzerland, have a few meals, stay somewhere, and pay the shooting range?"
Switzerland,34pc1w,janibus75,3,Sun May 3 10:52:20 2015 UTC,I understand your points if you only look at it from the money side. But if OP goes through with this trip it's also a holiday for him. He gains more from it than just shooting :)
Switzerland,34pc1w,RagingOrangutan,2,Sun May 3 12:03:22 2015 UTC,Very true. Switzerland is a wonderful place to visit.
Switzerland,34pc1w,fffmmm,3,Sun May 3 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"It depends on the means of travel, meals can be found around 10-20chf, prices depends on the range and the club, ammunition goes fron 20cents to way more per round.    Plus, Belgium requires me to have a residence, which I don't (as a student).    I'm searching for an introduction to shooting in Belgium, but if I can meet friendly people and see great landscapes in a nice country, it's a plus."
Switzerland,34pc1w,C4p5ul3,2,Sun May 3 11:03:48 2015 UTC,Is it possible to become a member of a shooting club and borrow someone else's gun for a few minutes?  Because that'd be a lot cheaper than a trip to Switzerland (assuming that you planned your trip exclusively to shoot).
Switzerland,34pc1w,anonlymouse,4,Sun May 3 11:08:35 2015 UTC,"I believe it is possible, but I would like to migrate to Switzerland in a near future, which motivates me to actually meet swiss people.    As said before, Belgian infrastructures are clumsy at best, and there is no real shooting culture here."
Switzerland,34pc1w,Aethec,7,Sun May 3 11:26:19 2015 UTC,"I doubt there is any special ""shooting culture"" here either. Or it is considerably less popular than you think."
Switzerland,34pc1w,C4p5ul3,2,Sun May 3 11:32:23 2015 UTC,"Well, from a discussion I've had with a swiss on the subject, shooting ranges are common, gun ownership is high, most people, even thought they are not into firearms, don't freak out about them and don't want to ban them all.    In Belgium ranges are rare, gun ownership is very low, and most people never saw a weapon except in museums or in the hands of police.    Everytime there is a tragedy that involves firearms, in both countries politicians try to make the laws a notch stricter, but in Belgium, they succeed all the time (there is no referendum system of any kind here).    Gun-policy wise, the big problem about Belgium is that the country heads the way of the UK, as does the whole EU.  If I get a gun here and now, it is likely to get confiscated within a decade or two.  Switzerland may not have a ""gun culture"" in the way the U.S. does, but at least you can enjoy your hobby without the police knocking to your door or a mountain of paperwork to fill."
Switzerland,34pc1w,Formagella,2,Sun May 3 12:19:04 2015 UTC,"most people, even thought they are not into firearms, don't freak out about them and don't want to ban them all   In general, yes, but you'll find a surprising number who do on this very subreddit."
Switzerland,34pc1w,Urgullibl,3,Fri May 8 21:47:38 2015 UTC,"Well, from a discussion I've had with a swiss on the subject, shooting ranges are common, gun ownership is high, most people, even thought they are not into firearms, don't freak out about them and don't want to ban them all.   That heavily depends on where you are in Switzerland. Here in Lausanne, people will think you're mad if you start talking about guns outside of specific contexts. And if you start talking about less gun control being better, everybody will quickly think of an excuse to stop talking to you. :)  Also, the ""gun ownership is high"" thing is artificially inflated by army guns, which most men don't care about but are required to have for a while."
Switzerland,34pc1w,bipartite_,2,Sun May 3 12:41:05 2015 UTC,"The redditor I was talking to was living in the German speaking part of the country but yeah, opinion towards gun ownership varies between parts of the country and between cities and more rural areas.    The army thing is actually great, because those who had to train with their rifles will actually understand what they'll vote on during gun control referendums.  Yet I can't understand how people could want more gun control when every country around you is doing worse crime-wise with way more gun control."
Switzerland,34pc1w,anonlymouse,4,Sun May 3 13:23:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is as much about gun culture than it is about people not freaking out for no reason.   I'd say the vast majority of the population is pretty cool about it, but it doesn't mean that everyone is going to be enthusiastic/or talk about guns.  Legislation (like most things) moves very slowly in Switzerland. Everything is really progressive and that's why I think most people don't jump to conclusions so easily.  That's not to say the law is really lax about this subject, because that'd be a lie."
Switzerland,34pc1w,shinnen,2,Sun May 3 13:34:13 2015 UTC,"well you still need various paperwork in Switzerland to own guns...

The tradition of sport shooting is deeply linked to the obligatory military service, and as such carries more a feeling of responsibility than just plain fun. If you main motivating factor for moving to Switzerland is lax gun legislation, you need to look a bit further than that and try and understand the culture of this country. We don't have the same 'gun control' debates as in the U.S., and we don't treat guns as some essential right the way the second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does. Understand that Switzerland is a country as well, not just some gunnit paradise."
Switzerland,34pc1w,zilti,1 point,Sun May 10 12:13:16 2015 UTC,"I perfectly understand that most Swiss citizens are not gun nuts, and I don't wish to become a gun nut myself.  However, most of them are responsible firearm owners and therefore more comprehensive when it comes to the political issues linked to guns.  You cannot deny that shooting in Switzerland is embedded in the general culture, even it it's discreet.  There are public ranges, many private ranges, a decent number of stores, the facilities are well maintained, there are shooting courses and a shooting community as well as shooting events, there far less cultural stigma around gun ownership. In short : shooting in Switzerland is affordable.    Ths is not true in Belgium, where owning firearms and shooting has become more of a privilege.  Gun laws are what made me look into Switzerland a few years ago, but on the meanwhile I've been educating myself in history, politics and economics.  And I came to realise that Switzerland is one of the very few countries in the world that actually has a durable and functionning democracy, a sustainable economy as well as good economical freedoms and is pretty stable overall.  This would be my dream country to live in, for political, economical, cultural and personal reasons."
Switzerland,34pc1w,C4p5ul3,1 point,Sun May 10 19:23:48 2015 UTC,There is a special shooting culture here. You don't have the world's largest shooting competition with a population of only 8 million without one.

You would only be able to shoot a couple of different types of guns and everything is very, very strict since it's pure sports shooting with those fancy rifles.  If you want to have fun, you should go to a private range and just blast away."
Switzerland,34pc1w,Urgullibl,2,Tue May 5 12:07:53 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The reason most public shooting ranges are skeptical about civilian guns is that Army guns are about as good as it gets as far as shooting precision and mechanical quality are concerned. For example, I have shot quite a few civilian firearms, and none are even remotely as precise as a P49. Granted, my own P75 is pretty darn accurate and better than any civilian gun I've ever tried, but even that thing is nowhere near as good as a P49. Of course, the fact that the ammo is subsidized doesn't hurt either.  Another point is that people on public shooting ranges usually have a realistic approach towards firearms. You won't find people who become unduly emotional when dealing with them on those ranges, which is a very good thing.  I highly recommend OP attend the shooting festival in VS. It's a quintessential example of Swiss gun culture if there ever was one."

Switzerland,34n413,sparkedcreation,4,Sat May 2 17:50:07 2015 UTC,"Hello, I will presume that you are American so I can tell you this. Europe has good public transportation systems so you won't have trouble getting there, and if you need help there will be places where you can ask as long as you speak in a calm and slow English. I haven't lived in Lugano for a long time so I may not be the correct person to answer but here is what I came to:   And finally, is there a better route that we should consider?   Ill begins with this: I searched your route in Google maps and it looks like it is faster to take the bus on the east side if the valley. Then you don't have to ride the ferry. Link:  Here.   What bus station should we be going to once we get off the Wilhelm Tell Express?   Google maps says that both bus routes (Menaggio or bellagio) begin right next to the train station. Link: Lugano - Bellagio or Lugano - Menaggio   What bus should we be trying to get on to get to Menaggio?   Again google maps says the bus is called C30 to Bellagio and C10 to Menaggio.   How long is that bus ride?   Google maps says about an hour for both rides.   How far is the ferry stop from where the bus from Lugano will be dropping us off?   If you mean the bus from Como, it looks like it will be about 50 meters from the bus station to the ferry. Again, these are well thought government planned stops so it should not be far at all.   I hope this info helps, slightly drunk now so I hope there aren't to many mistakes."
Switzerland,34n413,sandpatch,2,Sun May 3 03:00:30 2015 UTC,"On that specific day / time there are two ways to get from Lugano to Bellagio: Either via Menaggio (as you stated) or via Como.  Via Menaggio   Take the urban bus (Number 2) from Lugano station (right next to it) to Palazzo Studi. It runs four times in an hour, the trip will be about 10 Minutes. Walk (20 Meters or something - check out on Google maps) to Lugano Cassarate. Board the Bus Number C12. It will leave at 17.22h  The bus will reach Menaggio - Piazza Roma at 18.21h. Ask the driver if he takes a stop before that, so you can get out at Menaggio - Hotel Bellaviasta. There is a boat service that leaves Menaggio at 18.50h and arrives at 19.25h at Bellagio. (see the timetable)   Via Como  Another way to reach Bellagio is to change trains at Lugano.    Take the train leaving Lugano at 16.34h (that's not a long time for you to change trains. So it's probably best to buy tickets in advance). You will reach Como at 17.12h (timetable) At the Como Station take the bus C30 to Bellagio. It will reach your destination at 18.50h   Notes   The former trip is longer and more complicated. But it is more beautiful. Take the time, it is worth it. The SBB App is great for travelling in Switzerland. Since most of your trip will be abroad, it won't help you much."
Switzerland,34n413,unicornsworshipme,1 point,Sun May 3 11:13:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for this. We are doing the c30 on monday when we leave Bellagio, so we'll be able to experience it that day. We kind of just want to get to Bellagio as early as we can on Saturday the 16th so we can experience the town a little bit before we have to leave the next day. So I think we'll end up going via Menaggio.  Just so I am clear, this is what we would do:   Get on the Number 2 bus to Palazzo Studi Walk to Lugano Cassarate and get on the C12 bus at 17.22. The next part is kind of confusing to me. So we take the C12 all the way to Menaggio - Piazza Roma? Or do we ask the driver if we can get off on the stop before that? Then we get on the boat at Menaggio to Bellagio.   My only other question is, are we going to be getting to the dock with plenty of time to make the last ferry at 19.35? Even if we run a little late? I just don't want to be stuck up there.  Thanks again for all your help."
Switzerland,34n413,Formagella,1 point,Sun May 3 16:49:56 2015 UTC,generally when you're on a bus you have to reserve a stop by clicking the red button before it comes up if you want the bus to stop at a minor stop even if there's no one that wants to get on.
Switzerland,34n413,unicornsworshipme,1 point,Sun May 3 20:04:17 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the time table is not very clear. It just says that the bus stops at Menaggio, Piazza Roma. But on Google Maps there is also a station just before that, called Menaggio Hotel Bellavista. See here. Best thing is you ask the driver (or a passenger) if he stops there and that he informs you to get out.  If he doesn't stop there, get out at Piazza Roma. You just have to walk a bit longer to the harbour.  Then you have to walk 700 meters instead of about 100. This sucks if you have a lot of bagage. But you have to stay for half an hour in Menaggio, so you'll be fine."

These stickers must be purchased and stuck to your trash bag, otherwise they will leave it in front of our house. So my dad would sometimes sneak the trash over to apartment complexes with collective dumpsters. Those don't need stickers, because the rent covers it.

It - for example - applies to stealing electricity, so it's not a long shot to illegally using garbage service.  http://www.gesetze.ch/sr/311.0/311.0_017.htm   Wer, ohne zu zahlen, eine Leistung erschleicht, von der er weiss, dass sie nur gegen Entgelt erbracht wird, namentlich indem er ein öffentliches Verkehrsmittel benützt, eine Aufführung, Ausstellung oder ähnliche Veranstaltung besucht, eine Leistung, die eine Datenverarbeitungsanlage erbringt oder die ein Automat vermittelt, beansprucht, wird, auf Antrag, mit Freiheitsstrafe bis zu drei Jahren oder Geldstrafe bestraft."

Some especially anal bünzlis abuse this by requesting their neighbours not to flush the toilet, not to shower and so on and refer to this rule.  There was a court case about late night showers, and the court ruled that the inconvenience of going to bed being filthy overwheighs the inconvenience of hearing running water. So I think we're all good.  The ""unnecessary noise"" rules are meant for things like screaming children, loud music/television and so on, not for basic human needs like shitting."

I don't know how things have changed with Obamacare, but before that in the US you either:   spent next to nothing on healthcare and had no coverage had no coverage but then got sick / injured and had massive medical bills that often required you to declare bankruptcy had health care coverage through your job, and while you personally paid very little for coverage, your employer paid a massive amount   In Switzerland, AFAIK your job never pays for your health insurance, so all the spending is yours alone, but the base rate is fairly cheap.  The only fair comparison you can really make is the amount spent by a person and on their behalf in the US when that person has health care coverage vs. what a Swiss person spends on their own.  With that comparison I sincerely doubt the Swiss system is more expensive."
Switzerland,3499mc,anonlymouse,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:13:18 2015 UTC,The health care thing seems a bit suspect.   It's a bit hard to compare when different systems are used.
Switzerland,3499mc,Nounours1,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:46:26 2015 UTC,"My FEHBP (US gov't employee/retiree health insurance, partly paid by my former agency) cover is broadly comparable to Swiss health insurance: $250 annual deductible per person and 10% copay. The only difference is that (no surprise) FEHBP doesn't cover abortion, and it doesn't cover long-term institutional nursing care (EMS/Alters- und Pflegeheim). My share of the premium was $3,703 in 2014. Looking at comparis.ch the cheapest standard cover for a couple, 300 CHF deductible, with accidental cover, is 9,288 in Vaud. Next cheapest is 10,942  per year. Increasing the deductible to 2,500 only reduces the cheapest plan's annual premium to 6,204 for a couple of our age. According to Wikipedia, font of all knowledge of course, the US Gov't pays 72% of FEHBP costs, so the value of my plan is $9,745 p.a. or 9,089 CHF. Others may want to compare the Swiss plans with Obamacare or Medicare although then geographic limitations have to be taken into account: my plan works worldwide. (Unfortunately Vaud, at least, wouldn't accept it as comparable without EMS cover; they said another canton might. They were willing to ignore, at least, the lack of abortion cover.)"
Switzerland,3499mc,sgtoox,6,Sun May 3 12:27:42 2015 UTC,"Infant mortality rates are not comparable across countries. The US measures anything that has a heartbeat and comes out of a the womb as living, regardless of the in-feasibility of life. Most other countries only measure infant mortality if the fetus has viable life in the first place. So of course US will always have higher infant mortality rates. They are measuring two different things."

Switzerland,3499mc,sgtoox,5,Thu Apr 30 02:05:12 2015 UTC,"Changing the legislation for how infant mortality would be a major pain in the ass, bureaucratically speaking. But it really is annoying. I remember even in medical school , they also brought our infant mortality rates up as a sure sign of how bad the US healthcare system is (apparently behind Cuba, Mexico, and quite a few 3rd world countries) Which of course, is utter nonsense. But since infant mortality is a major determinant that WHO uses for gauging a nations health status, the US will always fall behind so long as we continue to measure anything with heartbeat as an infant death. The fact even our med school profs are largely unaware of the discrepancy is very obnoxious. But I guess it serves the purpose of being a nice ""shock"" factor to motivate and impassion people going into the US healthcare fields (""It's up to you to fix all the social disparity and make America healthy, we don't want to be worse than Mexico!"").   I actually got to work in Geneva with WHO for a few months, and most of the people there are well aware of the discrepancies, but they have no power over US legislation to change the definition of an ""infant mortality"""

From the website:   The percentage of adults living with HIV/AIDS in Switzerland is 0.40% while in The United States it is 0.60%. 100 people in Switzerland and 17,000 people in The United States die from AIDS each year. This entry gives an estimate of the percentage of adults (aged 15-49) living with HIV/AIDS.

Switzerland,3499mc,shahooster,29,Wed Apr 29 11:15:15 2015 UTC,"No, they consume more oil because they use cars much more than trains or buses. Switzerland has a much more dense and reliable public transport system.   They can't show you the comparison for people living in the same conditions, because the conditions are different, and that's what the website is trying to say. If the website compared people living in the same conditions, it would just say the same numbers. If the conditions were the same, there would be zero difference between the countries in electricity consumption, infant mortality, unemployment rate etc."
Switzerland,3499mc,tetroxid,8,Wed Apr 29 11:29:04 2015 UTC,"They consume more oil because they drive ridiculously huge cars, and their houses consume more electricity because they're made out of cardboard."
Switzerland,3499mc,shahooster,2,Wed Apr 29 16:34:57 2015 UTC,"For the record, we (US) don't typically heat with electricity, except in a very few places where electricity is cheaper than gas/oil.  So, while our houses are made of cardboard, that's not why we consume more electricity."
Switzerland,3499mc,tetroxid,3,Thu Apr 30 04:42:45 2015 UTC,"You always cool them with electricity. Also, many oil-heated houses have their heat distributed with air, which needs a fan to run 24/7."
Switzerland,3499mc,shahooster,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:26:16 2015 UTC,"Correct about the cooling, but the real difference in electricity usage doesn't relate to construction.  The Swiss climate during cooling months is far more mild than most of the US.  Switzerland is both cooler and less humid during the summer, so there is almost no need for AC.     For oil/gas-heated houses that use forced convection (mine does not), the fans are normally only on approximately when the burner is on.  These fans use relatively little electricity.  So, again, while Swiss construction is far more solid than typical US, I think quality of construction is only a very minor factor in electricity usage."
Switzerland,3499mc,Formagella,3,Thu Apr 30 09:20:49 2015 UTC,"A proper house with walls 35-45cm thick made of stone or concrete is cool in summer without any air conditioning necessary, even in direct sunlight and with 30° outside temperature (the house would stay at something like 24° all by itself). We have actual cellars that stay at maybe 12-15° naturally to store wine and whatever else, meaning we don't need a gigantic fridge. I do think building standards play a big role in energy consumption. A modern Swiss building uses a sixth of the energy of an old Swiss building, just think about that for a moment. Many new buildings in Switzerland are specifically engineered for maximum efficiency (my new office: heating and cooling with geothermal heat pumps that get their electricity from photovoltaics on the roof, toilets are flushed with filtered rainwater, only A++ efficiency electronic devices such as computers, monitors, coffee machines throughout, excellent public transportation meaning 90% of employees come by train). The savings are gigantic. I don't see the same kind of effort being made in the US, meaning the gap in energy consumption will only get bigger."
Switzerland,3499mc,tetroxid,2,Thu Apr 30 09:59:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, good points.  Don't underestimate US efforts to improve energy efficiency though.  New homes (and office buildings) are also much more efficient now than historically.  US GHG emissions have been declining over the last few years.  The focus is not only building construction.  The automotive industry is being held to fairly aggressive improvement standards.  The electrical grid is increasingly being powered by cleaner energy sources, including solar, wind, and gas (vs. coal).  Inefficient incandescent light bulbs are rapidly being phased out (by law), and replaced by LED. We are far from perfect, but I think the rest of the world often only hears the negative when it comes to the US."
Switzerland,3499mc,Lejeune_Dirichelet,3,Thu Apr 30 10:55:11 2015 UTC,"CAFE and all is nice but let's face it: many american cities are built around cars and public transport is completely useless. And you can't easily fix that now.   Also until the gas prices are so low, the suburbs won't stop expanding.   The US is doing stuff but it gets bad publicity because it's still one of the most energy-hungry countries per capita and it hasn't signed the global emission reducing agreements."
Switzerland,3499mc,HorizontalJogging,2,Thu Apr 30 11:38:04 2015 UTC,"The US has 5% of the world's population but consumes 20% of its energy. In their own interest, they should invest in efficiency like Europe does or they'll have a really big problem when the >2 billion peoples of India and China reach buying power parity. You can forget sub-100$ per barrel then, it'll be more like 300$. Their current cars and houses will be impossible to afford for most of the population."
Switzerland,3499mc,sgtoox,3,Thu Apr 30 15:28:56 2015 UTC,"You can forget sub-100$ per barrel then, it'll be more like 300$   Then we should probably push for Doris's Energiewende as fast as possible"

Switzerland,3499mc,sgtoox,3,Wed Apr 29 15:28:26 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. DC has really nice public transit though. Chicago, SF, and NY as well. But that's pretty much it with regards to decent transit in-city. It isn't financially wise to take on all the additional costs of living in city, especially if one is trying to have a family. Bad school districts, more crime, smaller housing, no long term prospects with regard to property etc. etc."
Switzerland,3499mc,tetroxid,2,Wed Apr 29 15:43:11 2015 UTC,"if fuel costed several times over the current price maybe the difference would reduce.   As far as the usual issues with american cities go, I think it's a bit of a chicken and egg situation. Also the fact that property taxes finance the school district is utterly retarded, there's no other way to say it. It's almost as if they wanted ghettos to stay ghettos."
Switzerland,3499mc,oelsen,1 point,Thu Apr 30 11:39:45 2015 UTC,"So you suggest artificially increasing the price of fuel to force people to live in the city? And most cities are incredibly expensive, where the incredibly wealthy live, the opposite of ghettos.  The problem came form there being near unlimited space in the US. So there is no real reason to spend heaps of money to build thing close when you can spread out for much much less.   This isn't even a unique situation to the US anymore. How many people that work in London actually live in London?"
Switzerland,3499mc,P1r4nha,3,Thu Apr 30 14:32:49 2015 UTC,Artificially increasing the price of fuel to encourage energy efficiency and a reduction of road network costs (not to speak of CO2 and NOX emissions) is exactly what you should do. The only thing that works in changing people's habits is monetary incentives. It's worked well for us (still is).
Switzerland,3499mc,RagingOrangutan,5,Thu Apr 30 16:42:09 2015 UTC,I call BS on the health care part. Is that proportionally to wages or absolute? (Like the Big Mac Index?)
Switzerland,3499mc,anonlymouse,6,Wed Apr 29 10:41:54 2015 UTC,It's out of pocket expenses. If you're insured you pay more out-of-pocket on average in Switzerland than in the US. American insurance pays earlier and covers more.  It totally ignores people that are not insured in the US (which Obamacare takes care of) or bad practices like denying coverage for pre-existing conditions etc. so many US insurances are infamous of.  EDIT: I looked it up and I was wrong: They consider all spending and adjust it for purchasing power.
Switzerland,3499mc,oelsen,5,Wed Apr 29 11:00:59 2015 UTC,"Yep. I can confirm that I pay more for healthcare here compared to the US. This mainly means higher insurance premiums since I'm generally healthy, but my deductible is much higher here too. Of course, it's kinda comparing apples to oranges since in the U.S. my health insurance was subsidized by my employer."
Switzerland,3499mc,atlantic,3,Thu Apr 30 01:38:15 2015 UTC,or bad practices like denying coverage for pre-existing conditions etc. so many US insurances are infamous of.   This happens in Switzerland too.
Switzerland,3499mc,huazzy,2,Thu Apr 30 16:49:48 2015 UTC,Adjusted? So we indeed hit the sonic wall....
Switzerland,3499mc,oelsen,3,Wed Apr 29 22:52:05 2015 UTC,"Me too. It was cheaper for me to be covered by a Swiss insurance while living in the U.S. than having a domestic one. This was the most expensive international plan. If you live anywhere else under that coverage, you pay less. Granted you have to be repatriated if it is something big, but healthcare outcomes tend to better in CH anyway."
Switzerland,3499mc,P1r4nha,3,Wed Apr 29 11:02:15 2015 UTC,"This has been the case for me because of the way healthcare is set up here compared to the U.S. Biggest being that the cost is paid upfront/out of pocket.  In the U.S the dentist/optometrist/doctor will run your insurance before the procedure and let you know what may/may not be covered. Here they provide the service and then you pay upfront and pretty much have to cross your fingers hoping that the insurance company covers it.  For example, I went to the dentist and the dentist recommended I get x-rays done to check my wisdom teeth. I pay the huge bill and submit it to the insurance company. A month later I get my reimbursement and see that x-rays won't be covered because the insurance company didn't think they were necessary. This was the same case with my eye exams. I merely took all the exams the optometrist sat me through and now the insurance company says I got unnecessary tests done so they won't cover it.  WTF? Why would I ever question why a health professional wants to do something?"
Switzerland,3499mc,huazzy,2,Wed Apr 29 13:21:55 2015 UTC,Because of Eigenverantwortung. Use that.
Switzerland,3499mc,P1r4nha,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:49:39 2015 UTC,"WTF? Why would I ever question why a health professional wants to do something?    That's the thing. It's still your health and your responsibility. It's also why people get second opinions from doctors, because they take responsibility and don't blindly trust doctors.  But I made a similar mistake a couple of years back and got an unnecessary MRI scan. It would be nice if I could just have people taking care of me and I wouldn't have to think of these things while I focus on more interesting and important things, but that's not a reality."
Switzerland,3499mc,Rosebunse,5,Wed Apr 29 13:35:37 2015 UTC,Come on dude. We're not talking about surgery here. Who gets a second opinion for getting a routine eye exam or dentist visit?
Switzerland,3499mc,PizzaDiavolo,2,Wed Apr 29 13:40:18 2015 UTC,"Hey, I agree, but I still heard people getting second opinions on banalities. I think they're more interested in the opinion they want to hear, not the correct one though.  Maybe it changes when you keep asking your doctor if he thinks it gets covered.  Last time I've been to the doctor he offered me a discount if I didn't require a special receipt to send to the insurance. Often they expect you do not even report it. Also my health insurance asks its customers to gather and only send in receipts if their sum reaches the franchise."
Switzerland,3499mc,P1r4nha,2,Wed Apr 29 13:45:42 2015 UTC,"I feel like this graph doesn't paint a good enough picture.

Switzerland,3499mc,readeduane_2,6,Wed Apr 29 10:49:51 2015 UTC,"From the website:   The GINI index measures the degree of inequality in the distribution of family income. In Switzerland it is 28.70 while in The United States it is 45.00.  This index measures the degree of inequality in the distribution of family income in a country. The index is calculated from the Lorenz curve, in which cumulative family income is plotted against the number of families arranged from the poorest to the richest. The index is the ratio of (a) the area between a country's Lorenz curve and the 45 degree helping line to (b) the entire triangular area under the 45 degree line. The more nearly equal a country's income distribution, the closer its Lorenz curve to the 45 degree line and the lower its Gini index, e.g., a Scandinavian country with an index of 25. The more unequal a country's income distribution, the farther its Lorenz curve from the 45 degree line and the higher its Gini index, e.g., a Sub-Saharan country with an index of 50. If income were distributed with perfect equality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the 45 degree line and the index would be zero; if income were distributed with perfect inequality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the horizontal axis and the right vertical axis and the index would be 100.

Mobility reserves the right to amend this list of countries at any time. The customer should personally obtain special insurance cover, such as European accident and breakdown cover.

There are many small villages around but you'd still be right in the centre of the country and could reach most places in a tolerable amount of time. Just remember that you might encounter some language related problems if you decide to stay way outside of urban areas. Many people speak at least some basic English but I wouldn't hope for too many people speaking any advanced level English in a rather lonely mountain town.

As far as I understood, for existing subscriber, nothing changes.   It all sounds good to me, hopefully the money saved will catch up in a few years and we'll have better contract deals etc. The Swiss mobile phone provider market is so uncompetitive, that something is needed to shake things up."

There are very few places that make a glacier so accessible and the views are amazing.  My daughter was amazed by it all at age 11. With a Swiss Pass it was about $100 extra per person for the trains from Lauterbrunnen to the top and back. No other admission fees, just some extra fee activities if you care to do them. We didn't. We walked around on top and below the building, and through the ice tunnels."
Switzerland,33t2wn,swiller,2,Sat Apr 25 18:15:20 2015 UTC,"Yes with a Swiss rail card it is cheaper, but as a tourist which the OP is asking, this would be incredibly expensive.  Here are some ticket prices just to go up and down the mountain.  175 CHF isn't cheap in my books, and I live in Switzerland.  That also doesn't include the price of taking a train to the mountain in the first place.

I've got better things to do with my time than watch white men in wigs paying musicians to follow them around for entertainment the whole evening.   Zurich loves to gloss over the fact that the  Zünfte seriously cry rivers of tears (this shit is entertaining, why 20 minuten is not on it still baffles me) if a woman wants to join the official parade. This was allowed once. In 2011. Why anyone would want to join this parade without getting paid is beyond me, but we're living in the year 2015.

While Zürich is still a stronghold of a rich, high-educated elite, the old elite of the Zünfte have lost most of their influence and are a side show to the rest of Zürich.   At least that's what I seem to see as somebody who lives in Zürich for a long time, but wouldn't call myself a 'real' Zürcher.

SVP currently has 30% percentage of the votes (as of the 12 this month), which is slightly higher than average for Switzerland, taking up 54 seats (out of 180) in the cantonal parliament. They enlisted the help of CVP and FDP making FDP-SVP-CVP the majority. ZH is deffo not as progressive as they want to be...  (And I live in Zurich as well.

Oops sorry, here's a nice statistic in case you're interested. btw I'm just pointing out facts, it's not like Vaud is a different case or better or whatever.

The train up there and back is over 200 CHF per person. For a swss, I would recommend to go up there once if at all for the experience but that's it. There are cheaper alternatives.  Zermatt is your average swiss mountain village + the Matterhorn. I was there twice in my life. Once when I came back from an alpine tour and the second time when I was on a short vacation in the valley. I was bored after a few hours. Zermatt wouldn't have anything going for it if it wasn't for the Matterhorn."

They also messed up their billing massively. Their network has become more unreliable over the past 12 months too.  Finally their roaming rates to Europe are disgraceful. Is it 4 francs for 2MB... Something like that.   The only reason I'm still with orange / salt is because they're massively cheaper than Swisscom.

(at night time)   Be a little bit street smart.. as you should be anywhere in the world. But you don't have to be worried about serious crime apart from drunk teenagers and such. Note that after a certain time at night, you'll need to get an additional night-time fare. Also note that most public transport do not check if you have a valid ticket, so it is up to you to buy the correct one. If they catch you without a valid fare, it'll be costly.   Do they only accept cash?   I'm not sure actually since I've had a yearly pass for ages.    I'm so excited!   Enjoy your trip!!

Switzerland,33mf3s,YeaISeddit,8,Thu Apr 23 18:48:51 2015 UTC,Do they only accept cash?   The ticket machines should all accept cash & credit cards. There may be some older models around which only accept cash but that's uncommon.

Switzerland,33mf3s,renner2,3,Thu Apr 23 19:39:08 2015 UTC,"American credit cards are actually chip and signature, not chip and PIN. What this means is that whenever you insert the card somewhere with a cashier/attendant, you'll have to sign for the purchase. That said, some (but not all) have a PIN for purchases at stuff like ticket machines. This page linked from /r/chipcards has a list of cards with chips on them (choose ""offline PIN"" to get a list of cards with a PIN).  There's also the chance that a card without a PIN will simply work in a ticket machine without asking for anything. To be absolutely safe though I'd get a card with a PIN on it."

I know that Swiss Airforce tested several plane before choosing the Gripen. But why did they only tested NATO planes?  I'm flying quite a lot of plane in fly-sims such as MS-FSX & P3D and I've been flying several differents plane. I've flown some planes that were tested by the swiss airfore prior the choice of the gripen. I also tested some russian planes and in my opinion, they are more agile than for ex the F/A-18 (I might be wrong as it's a sim and not the real life, so settings might be different or not set correctly).  For example, The Su-37 can fly faster, higher, carry more load, have a longer range than an F/A-18. And I'm pretty sure it might be cheaper."

I envy your job and his. It must be extraordinary to fly above our beautiful country!   Just a thought... I am aware that no air force currently uses them (as they are still in development), but wouldn't it be a possibility to consider drones with air-to-air interdiction capabilities? Wouldn't that allow the Air Force to protect Swiss airspace for 24/7 rather than its current régime of ""weekdays during office hours""? I realise that drones have risks of their own, but wouldn't they serve the purposes that cannot be fulfilled currently?"

Switzerland,33itpz,as-well,3,Thu Apr 23 06:59:13 2015 UTC,"No, that is not going to happen. The voice of the people was clear enough, and this might seem like a weird concept, but the politicians usually respect that, to a certain degree. If they want to buy new fighter jets, they need to have a new vote in parliament and, by extension, probably by the people too.  Now, the army could incrementally buy a fighter jet every now and then, but that will take waaaaay too long. They wanted to have 300 millions every year, but the Swiss army does not have that money just lying around.  Since the gripen was argued hard both from the left - for ideological reasons and for monetary reasons - and from the right - for thinking there would be better (or fancier) jets available, the Gripen will most likely never be bought by Switzerland."

Now, we do have a fleet of F-18s that will reach their End of Life in about 10-15 years and since it takes about 10-12 years to go from ""let's buy a plane"" to ""the new planes have been delivered"" I expect the Swiss army to start a new Plane purchase project this or next year.  That new project will do a completely new evaluation based on completely new requirements and I'm quite sure the Gripen will be allowed in the evaluation."

Switzerland,33itpz,zilti,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:23:42 2015 UTC,"They haven't been put aside, and they stay part of the military budget as they were before. The air force now speeds up the renewal of their ground based anti-air units."

We are a small, rich, international, symbol of peace country, which in my opinion are all things that attract possible harm. I'm by no means scared, I'm just saying that attacking Switzerland would have a HUGE impact on the world, which is what a lot of terrorist agencies want.   We have a tradition of a solid military and good defence, but at the same time we're neutral. We as a country voted NO for buying new planes, but I'm kind of rethinking that. That whole Ethiopia flight that we had to have the french air forces help was embarrassing.   Overall, I think we should get some new planes, I just don't know how many or which ones"

If Switzerland ever gets nuked, that will just mean that the Japanese will finally be able to take over the watch industry; Singapore will get all the asset management sector; American pharmaceutical companies will keep the lead they already have in the market; all the  companies that settled in Switzerland to have their taxes optimized will make some other country very happy; the international organisations that came to Switzerland are already courted by numerous other countries; transit through the Alps will continue to bypass Switzerland like it's been doing ever since the Alpeninitiative; nothing will change in terms of humanitarian aid or donations to charity since relative to our bigger neighbors, Switzerland's contribution is short from irrelevent anyway."
Switzerland,33itpz,SwissBliss,8,Fri Apr 24 16:35:59 2015 UTC,"I think you're reading into what I said a little too much  Switzerland is the epitome of safety.

Switzerland,33itpz,kleinfieh,-1,Thu Apr 23 15:29:36 2015 UTC,I think it's human nature that people mostly care about how close to their home something happens. So I doubt that there's a big difference between Paris and Geneva.  No need to downvote people with a different opinion.
Switzerland,33itpz,SwissBliss,2,Thu Apr 23 16:11:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't downvote you. My point is just that there is no reason to attack Switzerland, and everyone recognises our neutrality, so it would be a much bigger deal to break that than an attack in France imo."

Switzerland,33itpz,chromopila,3,Thu Apr 23 12:59:43 2015 UTC,"To me the weird part is comments like yours; the air force does not have enough jets to keep QRA running 24/7, therefore they mustn't have more planes because they don't even fly 24/7."

The F5s are going bad, which they have been for a long time. SAAB won the bidding as replacement, with the Gripen. A Referendum was held, people voted on it and now we won't buy the Gripen. IMO the most probable course is that the whole shebang (request for bids, bidding, etc.) is going to start anew. I don't know if it's going to be this year or some other year."
Switzerland,33itpz,chromopila,2,Thu Apr 23 17:26:41 2015 UTC,"I'd like to say I've followed events closely - though surely I have a bias since most news outlets I tap into come from a very swedish perspective.  If I understood correctly, the popular opinion behind the referendum wasn't taken as ""Gripen is not what we want"" but rather ""We don't want new planes at all"". Would you say this is correct? And how are the different manufacturers seen? Any dirty buisniess in trying to influence popular opinion?"
Switzerland,33itpz,hikari-boulders,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:41:38 2015 UTC,"The opinion behind the referendum was ""we don't want to put money in a fund to replace the aging Tiger fleet"". Different people interpreted the result differently, ranging between   ""Gripen is not what we want"" but rather ""We don't want new planes at all""   but also ""we have to find a new solution to finance the Gripen"" and ""we have to abolish our armed forces"". It's complicated as always when there's a vote on the armed forces."
Switzerland,33itpz,as-well,0,Wed Apr 22 21:49:11 2015 UTC,"IIRC the text of the referendum was ""Gripen is not what we want"". The reason why the result was the way is what is a mixtrue (IMO) between ""Planes cost too much"", ""we don't need planes in our military"" and ""I am not sure if the bidding was done correctly"". I know for a fact that everybody who has served in the airforce branch of the military has probably voted for buying the Gripen ;)"

When moving to Vaud (and getting married) I was living the typical suburb life, I knew some of the neighbors, some became friends, but that it. Now, with the kids growing I've joined the mens choir.

Switzerland,33cjls,YeaISeddit,8,Tue Apr 21 14:25:12 2015 UTC,A lot of people in Zürich go to bars expecting to be given privacy for some reason. You have to chat up 4 or 5 people before you find someone who isn't afraid of strangers. I've found that people speaking high-German are like 10 times more likely to meet someone new at a bar.
Switzerland,33cjls,gabilicious_ch,2,Tue Apr 21 15:03:20 2015 UTC,Unless you're actually German because then nobody likes you. /s
Switzerland,33cjls,errorkode,10,Wed Apr 22 18:16:22 2015 UTC,"Your problem is that we Swiss (at least in the german part) make friends the way we make watches: It takes a lot of time and work, but it will last a lifetime if you don't fuck up. I'm told that comes over as rather cold by people from other cultures, it's not meant to be though, it's supposed to be polite.  Can't really give you advice not already given here, except to give us some time and don't give up on someone just because he/she doesn't seem all the fired up about you."
Switzerland,33cjls,SatoyS,5,Tue Apr 21 16:42:11 2015 UTC,"I would disagree with you!  Generally, friendships can last lifetime, but if one of you moves somewhere else, it isn't really the same anymore. It's very likely, that you talk less (after a while) to each other and a used to be really good friendships becomes to a ""What's new in you life?"" friendship, just because you don't really know as much what is going on in his life as you use to...  There are too kinds of friendships:  Made as a child/teenager/young adult. We were simple, tons of other people within the same age range around --> easy! These friendships normally grow up with you and they are just fine!  Made as an adult: We are fucking complicated and meeting people beside work has to be done actively. Most of the other people around you already have friends. So you have to fit in the whole group or it is nearly impossible. That is why joining a club is useful, it gives you a common base of interests. But still, being the new guy is never easy...  I don't know why it is harder here to find friends, but I guess it has to do with the ""someone talks to me -> What does he want from me?"" logic which we have stronger developed as people from somewhere else. I wouldn't say that it is polite, but we are like this and others have to accept that. If you put a Swiss into a new location, he will seek for other Swiss (preferably from the same area). After that he will try to find the closest Europeans, after that similar countries and finally the rest of the world. This is base on my experience from travelling when you met other Swiss within a group.  Also we probably prefer a chat to friends more than a small talk with a stranger. But I would bet most of us prefer a small talk instead of just waiting for someone/something. Especially in bars this is the time when you meet new people (except for nowadays with smartphones...).  I can't really give OP a good advice except for going to places where you have a common base on interests or trying to meet people who are also looking for new friendships... Which is clubs or other foreigners, exactly the same advices others gave..."

Switzerland,33cjls,backgammon_no,-1,Thu Apr 23 16:04:48 2015 UTC,"And like a fine watch, Swiss friendships are incredibly fragile and will only work under unchanging conditions - ""if you don't fuck up"" means if you don't ever grow as a person, ever need some help, ever move even 10 km away, etc.   I don't know you, obviously, but I've gotten ""close"" to a number of Swiss germans, or at least close enough to speak freely about life philosophy, feelings, relationships, etc., and I have to say that their ideas about friendship are SHOCKINGLY, INHUMANLY shallow and fragile.  I have seen life-long friendships dissolved by little more than a guy getting an unpopular girlfriend, or over a 30 minute political disagreement. Some people I know see their best friends like 4 times per year. It's common to schedule ""hang outs"" with your tier one people weeks in advance, and still to have problems choosing a date.   From my point of view, based on my feelings of attachment, swiss germans simply don't bond. They don't. They don't form human attachments. They have the same level of commitment to their own brothers that I feel towards ""an ok friend"", and their notion of a close friend is my notion of a vague acquaintance.   It took me 5 years to penetrate society far enough to learn this, and you can imagine that it was extremely painful, but also allowed me to understand why people had been acting the way they had. Now instead of thinking ""that guy is cold as ice and obviously hates my guts"" I can think ""that guy seems open to hang out, in a swiss way""."

Then Saturday comes and she said: ""It was so nice to see you in such a spontaneous fashion!"" GIIIIRL, what are you drinking?! OP, there are of spontaneous people in Switzerland.

(I'm thinking low-cost clubs like triathlon, swimming, volleyball, footy, etc.,) If it weren't so expensive I'd definitely sign up to a sailing club or scuba diving club. That'd probably be amazing.  I really enjoy FabLab (there's one in Luzern too, idk where you are at) - I'm waiting for their knitting machine to be open to the public, the possibilities of gaudy pullovers for friend's birthdays will be endless. Go there when there's an open work-shop and check out what you're interested in. And sign up for a lunch on Wednesdays and get to know people and their projects. It can become expensive (membership fee is 100.-) so think about that first.  My Quartierverein (neighbourhood club) is fun too (and it's free), I'm an organising minion for free music concerts. There's something there for everyone. It's more on the organising side, but you get to know people!  Are you at uni? Check out their clubs too. I'm in a student's club of my old uni (as a special member) doing graphic design for their various tech projects. You sorta stay there undercover way past your due date if it's fun."

Switzerland,33cjls,entinthemountains,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:58:57 2015 UTC,"Hashing is a run that follows a trail set up ahead of time by someone, called the hare. The group follows the hare's trail, which is traditionally full of crazy turns, backtracking, drinking stops, and key sites and sights in the area.   The runs on weekdays are about an hour, the bigger weekend events can go for several hours. Drinking is encouraged, but not mandatory.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_House_Harriers"

Switzerland,33cjls,legrumsx,2,Tue Apr 21 20:29:04 2015 UTC,"In Zurich (not on Tuesday) you can walk the whole way, but it is more fun to run slowly. The way it is structured is no matter how fast you go, you all finish at the same time.  You need to bring 5francs - nothing else.   Almost everyone comes alone and most make friends after coming a few times. There are all sorts of people, the humour is very English and there is a major alcohol focus (although you don't have to drink).  You will certainly get to see places in Zurich you would not normally go."

That's exactly what I hear when I speak with other Brazillian people, that we just speak too darned fast :)  I think another factor is that until not too long ago all the soap operas in Portugal were Brazillian soap operas so we were a lot more exposed to your portuguese than the other way around.  The thing that really really trips me is that you use ""voce"" for an informal you while we use ""tu"".. for me ""voce"" is super formal, so the conversation becomes really weird for me - I get the feeling I'm being super disrespectful by using ""tu"" even though I know that's not the case.. :)"
Switzerland,33cjls,modestbacon,1 point,Thu Apr 23 08:24:36 2015 UTC,"First, I'm sorry for the soap operas. Nobody should have to watch those brain washing crap.

When she had an income at some point you're better off not married. I heard from someone that their parents divorced but lived together as that was a tax benefit.  There is/was also a proposal to change that, and the Christian party added as a clause that marriage was always between different genders."

Switzerland,338lhr,Formagella,2,Mon Apr 20 16:53:11 2015 UTC,can I ask you what it is? (I haven't read the article)
Switzerland,338lhr,leo_037,5,Mon Apr 20 17:06:45 2015 UTC,food. You can't show off much cool tech stuff this way. The Eiffel tower wouldn't have been built if this was the theme back in the day.
Switzerland,338lhr,Formagella,2,Mon Apr 20 17:27:49 2015 UTC,"ok... here's my opinion: I also have a higher than average interest in ""industrial tech"", but... I still find food very interesting (could even qualify as ""cool tech stuff"" in some cases) and even if that wasn't my thing, I would recognize that there are others who value food more than ""industrial tech"".  let us be nice nerds, otherwise the rest of the world will not like us."
Switzerland,338lhr,leo_037,2,Mon Apr 20 17:48:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I gave off the wrong impression: I love food and it can make for an interesting show, but I've been observing all that's been happening around the organization of this EXPO and I must say that the theme has been a big issue.  Everyone is trying to organize something meaninful around this besides the fact that you go in, visit and taste some food, because the EXPO ideally shouldn't stop at that but should give something to the city, and let me tell you the results are disappointing if compounded with how the works are going.   An example: the regional government of Lombardy hosted one EXPO-related event which was about gays (not difficult to guess which side was organizing the whole thing) and a pedophile priest was in attendance. That's just laugable.   I'm sure it will be interesting to visit if they can hide the unfinished work but there's a lot of negativity around it (especially financially, and whether it will bring anything long-term or it will just leave a big hole in the finances) and it rubs off on you."
Switzerland,338lhr,Formagella,2,Mon Apr 20 17:57:20 2015 UTC,"no problem, I understand now, that's interesting.  wait... how did the Lombards do something about gays when the theme was supposed to be food? and the priest, was he supposed to be there? did he finish serving a prison term long ago or what?"
Switzerland,338lhr,leo_037,2,Mon Apr 20 18:31:29 2015 UTC,"I think he never went to prison.   Very simply, a few politicians from the local catholic mafia (known as CL) decided to organize a gay bashing event and brand it as expo to get it financed.   Anyway it's just an example of how ridicolous and not serious the politicians in that country are."

There was a small Swiss pavillon and I was told by a friend who worked there, that it was the most popular among every other countries.  It had some projectors in the celling, that were pointed towards the floor, when you would put your hands together under the light there was a small animation happening in your hands.  Then there was a big screen with a short movie showing aerial views of the Jungfrau. It was quite breathtaking.  A little bit further there was a big piece of ice from a glacier kept at -20C°.  At the end a shop selling, chocolate, ricola, zigg bottles and other Swiss things.  So in short it's a good way to promote our country to potential tourists and introduce people to Swiss products."
Switzerland,338lhr,telllos,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:45:21 2015 UTC,I wonder how well targeted this is. Are the people there actually going to Switzerland and would have not done so if it were not for this pavillon?
Switzerland,338lhr,hubraum,2,Mon Apr 20 20:03:45 2015 UTC,"As with all marketing, you need to think in percentages. I'm not an economist, but usually I'd consider something like 2% conversion as a good target for such a thing. That would mean getting one in 50 to also visit Switzerland on a Europe tour when they otherwise wouldn't have, or coming to Switzerland specifically. Maybe that's a difficult goal, I give you that. On the other hand one also has to consider the negative effect it has not to be at a world expo (or to go there with something poor) - there could be bad press and the host country's people might take it as an affront."

The fact that you're only available until mid-August and just for a month will probably hurt your chances.

Switzerland,331ngp,FunkyFreshJayPi,6,Mon Apr 20 03:25:02 2015 UTC,"Hm, so I come from Vaud and Valais, and I've always lived between Lausanne and Geneva. It's a little hard to say since I guess I'm used to it, but you can definitely see a difference between Geneva-Vaud-Valais (I'm just talking about french speaking cantons). Imagine that transition like maybe Washington DC-N.Carolina-S. Carolina. The difference is that in Switzerland it goes fairly quickly (like an hour and a half drive) from urban and international city (Geneva and Lausanne) to a more country environment like Valais. When I go see family in Valais and drive through the villages in the mountains there with my Vaud car plate, I see every villager stare at me since I'm a foreigner (in Valais even Swiss people from other cantons are considered foreigners sometimes haha I'm exaggerating- btw this isn't racism at all, it's just interest and gossip), whereas in Geneva for example, people I guess are just used to seeing people and don't care really.  Now since you're in Vaud, that's kind of a middle ground between urban and country (which is why I love this canton). People aren't looking at you like ""why are you here you foreigner"", I think it's just a European thing and especially latin thing (french side) where people just like to interact with other people. Basically, you're very welcome here, don't worry about that, Geneva and Vaud and basically all of Switzerland is extremely international for that reason."

I'm sure you brought your clothes over from the US.   Even if you're white, the ethnicity shows a lot, regional variations within Europe are noticeable, maybe you don't notice that in the US because the whites are from all over and you're used to a great variety between people.

If you get up the hill to Kleine Scheidegg eat at the restaurant there with the outdoor seating and get a pan of Rosti.  It's hashed potatoes fried into a patty with stuff added in.. .yumm. and not expensive.  What is expensive is the train ride up to the top of the world - Junfraujoch, but it was worth it... once in a lifetime treat (but I've done it twice.)   Interlaken is cute but not much there really.  Lucerne and Zug are much more picturesque.  Lots to do in Lucerne, including a city wall walk and the famous bridge over the river.  Great cafes along the water. Nearby is Mt. Pilatus which we ascended by cable car after taking a bus to Kriens, then we descended by incline to the train at Alpnachstad.  We had a train pass - not too expensive for 4 days and we got a lot of use out of it.  Even though restaurants can be expensive, we offset that during the day by eating cheap from rails station stands for breakfast and lunch... or getting food at small sandwich shops or grocery stores.  One more side trip that was great was taking the train north to Shaffhausen.  Great preserved town center, partial town wall walk, and a short cab ride to the Rhinefalls which are beautiful.

Switzerland,32tzs8,leo_037,12,Thu Apr 16 21:27:03 2015 UTC,"The main issue in Switzerland is that it's a totally divided society. Basically there are younger, well educated people in the cities that want to be part of a global world whereas a lot of older people that are struggling with globalization what to isolate the country and refuse change. This becomes most clear when the country debates the relationship with the EU and immigration. 27% of the people vote for a far right wing party that absolutely hates the EU and all immigrants. At the same time like quarter of the people vote for left wingers that officially have the goal to 'overcome capitalism'. There is a massive abuse of direct democracy going on too. Basically politics in Switzerland is very populist and they constantly propose ridiculous referendums on which the people have to vote. Usually they get rejected but recently a referendum passed that would limit immigration from the EU. Unfortunately, limiting immigration violates the contracts with the EU, on which Switzerland depends and the EU doesn't want to renegotiate the contracts. So basically the people were so stupid that they managed it to completely hurt themselves. And the government is screwed too because this nonsenses is in our constitution now (no joke!?! I know...) and they are forced to do something they can't really do. Also most Swiss actually want to keep the contracts with the EU (without them the economy would fall into a crisis) but also limit migration, which completely contradicts itself.  You should read Switzerland–European Union relations  Other issues are the strength of the Swiss franc. The central bank pegged the exchange rate at 1.2 to the Euro as the strong increase of the Swiss franc during the crisis jeopardized the export economy. However, like 3 month ago before the ECB announced QE they got cold feed and removed the peg. The FX rate is almost at 1:1 to the Euro now making all the Swiss ~20% richer relative to Euro countries citizens but also all exports 20% more expensive. So now the economy is expected to grow only very little this and next year. That said, Switzerland is very rich and a 'crisis' like this is nothing compared to what a crisis is in other countries. E.g. it's absolutely normal that all graduate in Switzerland find jobs within reasonable amount of time. A crisis just means 'you wont get your dream jobs and/or you have to search a bit longer'.  The aging population is also a big issue (but not often talked about as most voters are old). Basically the baby boomers are all going to retire and will massively increase public health care costs and costs for retirement benefits. This generation didn't produce enough children so now a relatively small work force of young people has to pay more and more for big group of old people. The problem could be partially solved by letting more young, well educated foreigners in (like the Germans) but, as pointed out before, a lot of people are very hostile towards foreigners so they reject this idea.  A cultural issue in Switzerland is that the people are complacent and arrogant. Most Swiss think it's normal to be rich and have no clue how life is even in other European countries. Most also think that they are something better than other cultures and that the wealth of Switzerland proofs that. They wont show you this though, the Swiss are very understatement. But basically the Americans are all loud idiots that think bigger is better, Southern Europeans are all lazy (that's why they are poor), Eastern Europeans are all petty criminals because they aren't good for anything else and so on...  Also most Swiss are in total denial of what I just told you. They think Switzerland isn't racist/xenophobic because the fact that 25% of the people here are foreigners proofs this. In reality foreigners are denied political rights/citizenship for over 13 years even if you behave well, pay taxes, create jobs... ultimately people will vote on you whether you get citizenship and if you live in countryside village you're screwed because they hate foreigners and will deny it. You will never be Swiss, not matter how long you live here. Even if you are from a different canton and move to e.g. Zurich (which is actually quite open-minded), you will still be considered 'foreign'.  Along with that it's also that most Swiss think that they are the most democratic country on the planet and that the more people vote the better. They look even down on other (more) democratic countries. And those topics are both pretty much tabu. You're not supposed to say that Switzerland is xenophobic or that the democratic system is terribly designed."

Switzerland,32tzs8,Grilled_Bear,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:12:41 2015 UTC,"Well, the last sentence was intentionally pointing out cliches/exaggerating. Obviously not all Swiss think that all Eastern Europeans are criminals. I thought that was clear from the context. However, I really think that the rest is true. Ask random people on the street to which culture they look up. Or which other country they admire. People will struggle to give you an answer. Most Swiss really believe that they are better than everyone else. Most Swiss aren't even aware of this. They aren't intentionally arrogant but they just think it's normal to be rich. E.g. even people with an office apprenticeship go for long weekends to New York. In most European countries even people with university degrees can't easily afford this. With the strong Swiss franc is gets even worse.   Also it's very common that Swiss believe that they deserve to be rich. E.g. the average office clerk certainly isn't responsible for the wealth of the country but still think it's a result of their behavior. There are a lot of Italians or Polish that are way smarter and more diligent than an average Swiss but they are still poorer than the office clerk."

But it's wrong to conclude that it's all good. Also the world isn't static. What worked decades ago doesn't have to work in the future. Pretty much every history book will confirm this. Countries rise and fall. There is no universal law that Switzerland has to be rich forever. If people keep behaving like children, using populist referendums 'to send a message' and nonsense like that, then there will be a price. The Swiss have become complacent and arrogant. That was my point. People think there are no consequences and that Switzerland can get away with everything.    I know Italy very well, your problem is ""there are a lot of Italians that"". A lot. Not enough. Go there to live for some time to understand.    That's an egg or chicken question. You can assume that people in all countries are roughly similarly intelligent. So it's mainly about how the countries are organized, their starting point and probably also culture. But it's easy to get rich in Switzerland. Everything is already there, the good school system, the jobs, the safety..."
Switzerland,32tzs8,whitepalms85,5,Fri Apr 17 19:08:51 2015 UTC,ultimately people will vote on you whether you get citizenship    This is only true for small villages. And it's far from a taboo topic to discuss this; there are several court cases and an initiative back in 2008 (which wanted to make all citizenship decisions subject to vote  - it failed!).

But you aren't allowed to say that, because if 'the people' decide something in Switzerland, then it's basically holy.   which wanted to make all citizenship decisions subject to vote - it failed!   That's exactly what I mean. How is that a justification? Someone should have stood up to the people and told them that it's not okay to vote on people and reject them on stupid reasons. People here think that everything is positive as long as it was a democratic decision. But let's be honest, all of people are fucking idiots. Other countries build system where this is actually considered to basically protect the people from themselves. In Switzerland every nonsense can be written into the constitution. Or people vote for extreme things 'to send a message'. That's fucking childish. Messing with the country to send a message?! That really proofs that this is not a good solution."

In Switzerland it's not allowed to criticize the people. In other countries politician can say 'this is something the people should vote on' and the majority agrees. And that's very smart. The Swiss are like teenagers.   Also, this is easy to proof. Just go on the streets and ask people basic questions about economics and politics. Most don't know. They aren't competent enough.   Or when an ETH professor gets rejected. It's obvious that this is just racism/xenophobia and shows that people aren't mature enough. In Switzerland everyone thinks voting comes without a responsibility."
Switzerland,32tzs8,whitepalms85,2,Fri Apr 17 19:15:33 2015 UTC,"Since when people vote on ETH professors?   In other countries politicians can and do say  'this is something many people want to vote on but I won't let them because it's not convenient for me and I don't want to accept the will of the people' and they people are screwed.  There is no truly binding form of popular voting in most democratic countries on this earth.   You don't need knowledge of economics to know that politicians getting huge wages or perpetual annuity even if they worked for just a few years is wrong.  Give the power to the people and all of this would disappear in an instant.   Again, it's not clear who protects the people from themselves since the people should have power over politicians like you said too."
Switzerland,32tzs8,Formagella,0,Sun Apr 19 21:26:33 2015 UTC,"Since when people vote on ETH professors?   There was a ETH professor that lived in Switzerland his whole life, had a family here, paid taxes, no crime and he got rejected by some racist idiots from some countryside place. It was kind of a big story in the news a few month ago.   I won't let them because it's not convenient for me   That utter bullshit. You are implying that all politicians have some evil plan to destroy the country. There are a ton of countries that do fine without constantly voting on everything. The Swiss have proven that they can't handle the responsibility. It really doesn't matter what 'the people's will' is on a constant basis. Most people are stupid and change their minds all the time. The Masseneinwanderungsinitiative proves that very well. People want no immigration but they also want contract with the EU so that they can find jobs and be rich. Just that this isn't an option. The people voted for something that isn't available because they were too stupid to understand it.    I don't want to accept the will of the people' and they people are screwed.    That's complete bullshit too. I'm not saying we should be a dictatorship. I don't think you even understand how other democratic systems outside work. People can refuse to reelect politicians that screw up, they can change the majority in the parliaments and so on. Also there is a bit difference between voting on referendums on laws created by the parliament, which kind of makes sense, and the bullshit Volksinitiativen, which serve absolutely no purpose.   You don't need knowledge of economics to know that politicians getting huge wages or perpetual annuity even if they worked for just a few years is wrong.   Lol, in what kind of shitty job are you working?! Ever lawyer or banker makes much more than a Federal Council. You don't even have to be a CEO or so to make that kind of money. There are much better and easier ways to make a lot of money. That's just the SVP propaganda bullshit they feel to their uneducated voters (and btw. a lot of the SVP trash has actually much more money than councils too).   Again, it's not clear who protects the people from themselves since the people should have power over politicians like you said too.   You can do that in the constitution. A lot of countries have that. The German basically elected Hitler into power. So much about 'the people's will'. They can be very wrong.   Our constitution is total crap. You can just change with stupid Volksinitiativen. If we ever have a big radical party they can destroy the whole country very easily."

Go to Italy and see for yourself how much the consiglieri regionali earn and the privileges they enjoy, especially in Sicily.

You don't know much about Italy and have never spoken to italian people and observed their politics in a continous way otherwise you'd agree that direct democracy would help them (and not the non-binding referendums they sometimes did in the past and that were often not respected, and had quorums too, basically eliminating freedom of voting for liberals in the closet living in small conservative villages because the priest simply can say do not go to vote and everybody will see if you go).    Our constitution is total crap. You can just change with stupid Volksinitiativen.   oh yeah, let's set it in stone, it doesn't matter if after 50 years the people which make up the state don't feel it's what they want anymore.  The constitution is not a revealed scripture.  It's written by humans in a precise period of time and it fits that period of time, it has to change with the times.  A big radical party did the French revolution, if there was such a big political shift in Switzerland, we'd be able to do it without spilling blood because the state is set up to be perpetual, other states have constitutions which provide no way out if e.g. the people want to dismantle the country.

They voted locked lists, and you can choose between 2 or 3 at most if you don't want your vote to be wasted.    That happens in dictatorships, not established democracies.   So Italy is a dictatorship now?   The constitution in any country is voted on by people.  Why is doing this now wrong, but if it was done 50 years ago then it's totally correct and should be unchangeable in certain parts of it?   For example, I love how the constitutional court in Italy stated that the government can't block the increase to match inflation only of state pensions above 90k€/year. Oh the wisdom of the ancients! And changing the constitution is so difficult that nobody can do it, unlike in Switzerland.   Article 7 of the italian constitution is one of the fundamental principles, which cannot be changed.  It says that the Lateran Treaty regulates the relations between Holy See and Italy.  This pact was created and signed when Mussolini was in control. The church got financial support and in exchange supported him.  Don't you think it would be better to be able to change this?   Not to mention that this inflexiblity creates huge problems of interpretation and long constitutional debates which stifle much-needed change.   Art. 11 says Italy refuses aggression war. It's not respected because it's not clear enough.   Art. 5 says the country is indivisible.  What if one days Europeans decided they wanted to form one big federation, but that certain current states are too big and would be an inefficient middleman?  Nope, can't be done, these guys 60 years ago decided it is so and that's how it's gonna be. Forever."

If you ever witness such an event, try catching the fainting guy so he does not hit the ground with his head."
Switzerland,32ow2c,hopsafoobar,9,Wed Apr 15 16:09:43 2015 UTC,This is a picture. I would like to see a video before forming an opinion. But if no one is helping him. Yeah it's a shame.
Switzerland,32ow2c,telllos,-16,Wed Apr 15 17:45:23 2015 UTC,"Only an officer can go and help him. Soldiers arent allowed to move during a salute unless an officer told so.  But I guess as a good little left side boy, you didnt do your military service, so you don't know anything about formalities etc"
Switzerland,32ow2c,unCoreMeltdown,2,Thu Apr 16 07:44:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah fuck this, if I were next to him I'll help him no matter what the officer would think.  To think that a stupid formation for a foreign president matters more than the health of a soldier is a disgrace for our country and I'm sure Hollande would think so too. Especially since he's also such a good little left side boy ..."
Switzerland,32ow2c,Syndic,0,Thu Apr 16 16:21:55 2015 UTC,"in another pic I saw there is another soldier beside him checking on him so there was a swift enough reaction.   Hollande may be leftist but he's still french, militarly hawkish and with a big ego so I think he appreciates formal receptions."
Switzerland,32ow2c,Formagella,2,Thu Apr 16 16:48:20 2015 UTC,Sure such a formation is impressive. But if it's more important then the health and safety of a soldier then I don't know what it says about the country.  Actually the fact that we're so uncoordinated that they had to stand in the sun so long (more than 1h at least) that someone faints speaks for itself. I mean I doubt that Holland was present more than 5 minutes.
Switzerland,32ow2c,Syndic,-1,Thu Apr 16 17:31:53 2015 UTC,"1h? Cute...Trust me, thats nothing unusual and belongs in there. Its a show of discipline, nothing else."
Switzerland,32ow2c,Redimo,3,Thu Apr 16 20:27:39 2015 UTC,It would be a show of discipline if they could form the formation 5 minutes in adavance without the need to messuring every little detail.  Making the formation several hours in advance messuring everthing just to mention that you're hours early and then have them stand there for this time is a sign of incompetence.  But this is not surprising considering we talk about the joke the swiss army is.
Switzerland,32ow2c,Syndic,-1,Fri Apr 17 06:32:09 2015 UTC,"And that comes from beeing treated as a joke by everyone. Swiss army is not what it should be, and everyone that think 18 Weeks RS is good is a goddamn moron. 21 Weeks are barely enough."
Switzerland,32ow2c,Redimo,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:37:57 2015 UTC,And still there are a lot of people who claim that the Army back in the 80's or so was better than what we have now and they also has 18 weeks RS.  I personally think it has much more to do that someone can become and officer with so little experience. On top of that the top brass are looking out for each other way to much. It's more important who you're friends with than how good a leader you are.

Switzerland,32ow2c,Syndic,2,Wed Apr 15 18:06:49 2015 UTC,I was not. I guess I was a bit hasty as was the photographer.
Switzerland,32ow2c,zilti,-2,Wed Apr 15 18:09:42 2015 UTC,Plus you're apparently a prejudgemental scumbag.
Switzerland,32ow2c,Syndic,2,Thu Apr 16 10:30:37 2015 UTC,I've seen enough shit in the military that I wouldn't be surprised at the least if the superior who's in charge wouldn't want his formation distributed due to some soldier fainting.  I mean guess why this soldier has fainted in the first place? It wasn't because he had to stand there for 30 minutes. More likely it was several hours because those guys are horribly at planning shit. So yeah I don't trust the Army to value the health of their soldiers as much as they should do. All from personal experience.  But great contribution of you with the name calling.
Switzerland,32ow2c,zilti,-1,Thu Apr 16 11:17:12 2015 UTC,"No, they weren't standing there for that long, I know that for a fact. See? Prejudgemental all over again! Knee locking is a thing."

What do you mean outside of Geneva? The lake is for the majority in Switzerland, and France has a part of it too on the bottom (geographically).

Switzerland,32hee5,thcus,2,Tue Apr 14 06:38:08 2015 UTC,"How they pulled this of? for german-speaking broadcasting stations, the tv rights are distributed within the language area (and not countries). Which unfortunately means, that we're always gonna draw short because a) the pool of german broadcasting station is fucking huge and b) the german (pay) tv broadcasters have bigger budgets as we swiss broadcasters have.  Among french broadcasting stations, the tv licences are distributed within countries, which means that the pot of broadcasting stations is already small (because, how many french-speaking tv broadcasters from switzerland are there?), a smaller budget is needed to purchase the rights. And apparently, it juuuust fitted the budget of RTS1 which also had a slot available :)  too bad they didn't really advertise it much :/  Also, the right distribution above might only be true for HBO."

Last time I checked, neither of those services were available in Switzerland.   GoT is probably the most popular TV show in the world (at least among younger people). Providing legal access to a show that is hugely popular is, to me,  so much more ""service public"" than 90% of the content that's broadcasted on RTS/SRF.

It's a short drive up from Nyon, and there are plenty of easy through to hard hiking paths in the area. For starters, la ballade de Béatrix is a great short walk starting from St cergue with a decent view. Another great walk from St cergue is the road up to les Fruitières de Nyon. At the end you can buy fresh mountain cheese, and you'll also be treated to an exceptional view. The walk up to la Barilette (large tower you can see in the Jura above Nyon) is really nice as well, but it's a bit harder. If you continue up from la Barilette all the way up to the peak of la dole (airport radar), you'll get an insane view - plus there is a great restaurant you can walk down to a few minutes away. Finally there are also a bunch of great walking areas around la givrine, a few minutes up from St cergue. In the winter it's a also a great place to go sledding or cross country skiing. There are a bunch of other great routes in the area, with lots of interesting and beautiful places that I'd recommend you to check out. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me."
Switzerland,32cq9m,SwissBliss,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:17:09 2015 UTC,"Oh well you've come to the right place. I'll repost some I've already posted caused I've answered similar questions in a few other threads:   Between Geneva and Lausanne, you go up the Jura to a small town called St Cergue. There is literally the best burger place in Switzerland called Rando Burger. Trust me, go there Other than that, not far away but you go up the Jura in a slightly different place. Go up to La Dole and there is a tiny restaurant called Chalet/Buvette de La Dole. Amazing food, super chill environment, middle of nowhere, animals right next to you, and a hike to the ball on the mountain Anywhere between Geneva and Lausanne is stunning http://www.lavaux-unesco.ch/data/dataimages/upload/ambianceHome6.jpg  But if you want to go to an ""off the beaten path"" area, then I HIGHLY recommend camping/hiking around La Dole in Vaud. http://goo.gl/5UJH92 This is on the Jura mountains. When you get to this small chalet/restaurant it is completely surrounded by wilderness (forests, creeks and such, and a great view of Lake Geneva), and you can climb to that ball on the mountain in about 40 minutes, and 20 minutes back down. I've camped there many times and it's beautiful especially when you walk through those cow fields and through the forest. Find a clearing and pitch a tent. Just be aware of boars. I've never seen one but you'll definitely see the tracks they leave Edit:St Cergue is beautiful too. St Cergue is amazing so you could just stay in that region and go in the plentiful forest. If you do go there, go to Rando Burger, best Burger in Switzerland imo. Also while you hike you'll probably randomly encounter a refuge to eat and drink so that's nice. Really the whole Jura mountain is beautiful because it's not high enough to be full of snow all year, instead you just have nature at its finest. If you have any question about the French speaking part of Switzerland just ask :) Another quick little spot that I found maybe 7 years ago: http://imgur.com/a/FFtcs#0  I made the directions from the closest town. It's on the way up to La Dole as mentioned above. Basically it's a nice little lake/pond in the woods, and if you go up through the woods from there by foot, and follow the river up you'll get to a place I like to call ""paradise"". Basically it's a sloped ""river"" (very shallow, like 3cm deep) down the mountain with tons of moss growing in the stream, and I usually walk up it bare foot which is really cold, but nice.   Please ask if you have any questions :)  Edit: Here's another post I found, sorry if this is a bit of a mess of a comment, I'm just copy pasting my old comments.   When do you plan to go? Because it can be harder to get there in winter because they close the roads due to snow, and since the only thing up there is a small refuge and a restaurant further away, it isn't much of a big deal. In Summer there can be a few tourists but not many. http://imgur.com/vDUI6jJ,uPRdted,t1Mzh28#0  Here is a quick map of the area with 3 pictures. Basically from Geneva you go East along the lake until you reach Nyon, then you go up to the mountain and follow that road I indicated. Once your up there you can do whatever you want. Hike (fairly easy) up to the ball (La Dole), enjoy the view of Lake Geneva on one side and France on the other, eat and chill at the refuge, and then just walk around the endless forests till you find a place to put a tent up. That whole mountain is really really amazing"

Hiking up Säntis will probably not be possible. If you want to hike now just go to some of the lower hills (less than 1000m) and you should be fine.

I would strip the components out of your desktop unit and leave the box and power supply at home. You can get a new box and power supply for very cheap in the US. Unless the books are very rare and you can't find replacement in the US I would leave them at home.

Switzerland,327y6e,startwearinggreen,3,Sat Apr 11 22:53:49 2015 UTC,"I moved from Switzerland to California and moved most of my stuff by post. I had to deal with customs myself but it's surprisingly easy. IIRC each box was around 100 CHF. Fragile stuff got damaged but my desktop computer survived. I shipped it in the original box of the tower, with the thick styrofoam blocks to keep it stable. I kept the hard drive with me and checked it in on the plane (with a ton of bubble wrap to keep it safe).  It took about 3 weeks to get the stuff here.  It's not ideal but for stuff that won't break it works great."
Switzerland,327y6e,086,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:17:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the tip. I would probably disassemble the PC anyway, especially HDD and GPU which can break pretty easily."
Switzerland,327y6e,ours,2,Sat Apr 11 22:54:55 2015 UTC,"I think the box was what saved the components inside. But I'm not sure I'd ship the PC this way again. However this is probably safe for your books and binders.  Consider the option of selling your computer(s) and buying a new one in the US. The cost of shipping, the risk of damage and the (somewhat) lower prices of computer equipment in the US may be more worth it.  Also, make sure your shipping boxes are good quality. I wouldn't go for plastic boxes, though, because my boxes were mostly damaged by compression when I did this. I guess what I mean is, don't go for the cheapest boxes, buy heavy-duty cardboard and tape them properly.  Now that I'm on my computer, I can write about the customs stuff. If you're relocating to the US you can import your stuff tax-free as long as you've owned it for a year. They have no practical way of checking that so it's up to you to declare whether you've owned things for less than a year - and you'll pay customs on these items if you do.  First, plan your boxes. You'll need to inventorize them all. Number them - that's very important, and know what is in which box. If your list is wrong you'll be in trouble.  Second, You'll need to get shipping slips from the Swiss Post (Frachtbrief/Lettre de voiture). The post office will give them to you.  Third, for each box that you're shipping, you will need to complete a Declaration for Free Entry of Unaccompanied Articles, here is the form. In part IV, if you want your items to get in free (because you've owned them more than a year, or because you're willing to declare that you have), check box 8. On the second page you should list all the items in the box, but you can also write a ""pro-forma invoice"" and say ""see attached list"" there.  A pro-forma invoice is a document that lists all of the items in the box, their quantity, unit price, and total price (in USD). At the bottom, display the total price in USD and the total weight of the box (in metric and imperial units, it helps). Do NOT put a value of 0 for anything. If something is worth 0 to you, say it's worth $1. Also make sure your list has the sender's address, the recipient's address, the box number, and add a mention to say ""All items in this box were owned and used for more than one year"".  So now you have N boxes and for each box:   A completed Frachtbrief A completed CBP form 3299, Declaration for Free Entry of Unaccompanied Articles (+1 copy for your records) A pro-forma invoice listing the box's contents (+1 copy for your records)   Take the boxes and their documents to the post office. They'll give you the carbon copy of the Frachtbrief (it's in a ton of copies, I think the post keeps one, you keep one, one goes to the swiss customs, one to the US customs, and one stays with the box forever?), put the frachtbrief, form 3299 and pro-forma invoice in the document pouch they'll stick on the box.  Your copy of the Frachtbrief will have the tracking number, which works on both the swiss post's website and on USPS' website (in my case, they only agreed on 5 of the 7 boxes I sent, USPS doesn't have tracking for one at all, and they say they didn't deliver the last one whereas the swiss post says it was delivered - and it was).  Go take your plane to the US and wait for the delivery. USPS sucks a little so it helps if you can be home to receive the packages/you have a concierge who can take them for you/you can ship them to your work or somewhere like that. Done.  Final note: I only sent low-value stuff so I didn't really look into the insurance. If your documents are not replaceable, you probably still want a more expensive option that has insurance.  HTH!"
Switzerland,327y6e,hubraum,2,Sun Apr 12 02:38:40 2015 UTC,"Never used one, so hard to really give you a good advice. But for starters, you're looking for a cheap one, that sounds like you have already figured out some solutions. Was it just the ones you mentioned? Try a Google search with ""International Moving Companies Switzerland"", since you don't want a simple document shipment.  Also consider that the US has a different voltage range, 110 not 230 V, check your monitor if it really works under that condition.  What does ""Desktop"" exactly mean? Just a table, a table and a cart?  If you consider buying these stuff (Monitor/Desktop) overseas, you could pack your books/binders in an additional suitcase.  Cheers"
Switzerland,327y6e,ours,1 point,Sat Apr 11 14:20:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. By desktop I meant a computer.

Switzerland,327y6e,hubraum,3,Sat Apr 11 14:27:31 2015 UTC,Most power supplies should be multivoltage. You'll probably just need to buy new cables in the US and be good to go. Check your manual.

Switzerland,327y6e,telllos,2,Sat Apr 11 15:14:18 2015 UTC,"Older ones (or maybe lower-end ones, haven't seen those switches since a decade). New ones should go anywhere from 100-240V automatically."

Switzerland,327y6e,USCgamecocks,1 point,Sat Apr 11 15:17:28 2015 UTC,Maybe go to Germany it could ne cheaper to ship from there.
Switzerland,327y6e,fufai_ter,1 point,Sat Apr 11 18:38:26 2015 UTC,"I shipped several boxes with the 'Post', they have different options depending on the weight of the stuff inside. Especially for books, it's a good option because it was definitely cheaper than sending it with UPS etc. I had three boxes in total and paid something around 400 CHF (from Switzerland to California). The only thing that broke was the glass of a picture that I did not pack well enough. It was mainly books and smaller stuff, not something easily breakable as a monitor. Unless its an absolute great monitor, you probably will be better off just getting a new one over here."
Switzerland,327y6e,lhatchy1,1 point,Sat Apr 11 18:55:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, check Amazon to see the price of the stuff you're going to ship. If it's heavy electronics and books it may be cheaper to buy what you need here.   Enjoy! I'm in denver now, trying to move to Switzerland."

Switzerland,327qpw,oelsen,1 point,Sat Apr 11 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"YEAH BUT In Switzerland, nobody can claim or collect except the state. So there is a register with open claims and the collection is done only by the state. So big difference to foreign law there. AND ALSO There are private credit reports readily available. But they don't count, because the law concerning rent and paying up rent are quite skewed against the renter/lessor/landlord."

I have heard that the EU has set up limits on how expensive roaming may be, so it might be possible to find one in one of the EU countries (Switzerland is not in the EU) which you can use in all of them for reasonable rates. For Switzerland you'll probably need a seperate one."

Switzerland,327n08,MialoKoukoutsi,1 point,Sat Apr 11 13:58:38 2015 UTC,"I think switzerland is one of the most expensive places for mobile costs, especially if you want to roam through the EU. Sunrise do an ok-ish deal (get pay as you go and then buy ""add-on"" packages for cheaper data)  Some european providers (such as Three UK) have special deals with certain countries which makes roaming much cheaper (e.g. http://www.three.co.uk/Discover/Phones/Feel_At_Home). Look around to see if there is a deal.  Otherwise Lebara mobile (http://www.lebara.fr) generally market themselves to people needing to call abroad/roam so worth looking at."

I think this has historical reasons, because in any older texts you will not find any uppercase Ä,Ö or Ü, they were all written as Ae, Oe or Ue, but I am not really sure why it used to be done that way."
Switzerland,327q88,flawr,3,Sat Apr 11 09:19:45 2015 UTC,It may be related to the fact that upper-case umlauts were not available on Swiss typewriters because the space was used for French/Italian accents.

Honestly, it's hard to imagine you're going to meet other people or tourists just out and about while in Zurich for a holiday.   That said, I would see the city, suck it up and stay in a hostel for a night or two, that way you'll have more chance of meeting people... with the people you meet go and party on Langstrasse or Hardbrücke on Saturday.  Recover the next day, see the city and go to Uetliberg. If you're staying much longer, get a train to Interlaken, check into the backpacker hostel. While you're there, see Grindelwald and go for a hike there. May is also the best time for paragliding, so sort that out!"

Switzerland,3243y1,T3chnopsycho,3,Mon Apr 13 08:20:11 2015 UTC,I'm curious. What do you do in a Pfadi Verein? Is it mostly hiking or do you have specific tasks do you do?
Switzerland,3243y1,Eldona,3,Mon Apr 13 08:25:08 2015 UTC,"In case it wasn't clear. I'm a member of the scouts (and our local group has the legal form of a Verein (association)).  Generally we have ""exercises"" (we call it Übung) but it is more like a meeting) every Saturday from 14:00 - 17:00 (2pm - 5pm :P). I am leading a group of cubs so we don't really do real hiking (although we do go walking longer distances in camps).   We usually meet up near the forest and most of the time do different activities (e.g. playing games, following a trail of clues, make a fire and grill, build stuff at our group place which is our hidden place where we can hang out etc.). Most of the time we tie in a story into these activities. Which makes it a bit more interesting and gives a sort of goal. From time to time we also do some more action packed stuff like building canopy or bridges and stuff like that.   Then we also have some special events over the year where we do promotion ""Übungen"" in town to do some publicity work. Or we are at the local fairs (chilbi) with a stand where we sell stuff.   And of course the annual camps we make where we do a lot of different stuff.   And then of course there are events that we just do in the group of leaders (i.e. without the boyscouts and cubs) but these are actually more like things you just do with a group of friends (although they are still somewhat connected to values we share as scouts). Some examples would participating in the ""Siechä Marsch"" Which is a 50, 80 or 100km hike, abseiling, visiting a ""[scouts openair](www.pff15.ch)"" which is an openair but organized by scouts for scouts (yeah we aren't just the friendly people that are strict and disciplined (we are though when doing our duty :P), and a lot of other stuff.   If you have any other questions or something wasn't clear just ask :) I'm happy to give answers.  EDIT: Maybe regarding the tasks we have to do. Basically the Swiss Scouting Association (Pfadi Bunder Schweiz or PBS) has, like most associations oriented around outdoor activities and sports, a partnership with the ""Jugend & Sport"" organization which belongs to the Department of Defense, Civil protection and Sports (VBS) of the government. If we do a camp we can apply for a J&S subsidy of (IIRC) 5.5 Swiss Francs per participant per day. But in order to receive that we need to have a certain number of leaders who have done courses (which J&S defines what has to be learned at those). These courses are held by other scout leaders who have already done them (and the course leader needs to have done even other courses to lead the course). I'm actually currently also leading one of these course this year (the main camp will start next Saturday). The younger scout leaders learn a lot of skills in these course on how to plan ""Übungen"" and in the 2nd course also how to plan a camp week. Furthermore J&S demands that if we want to apply a camp for subsidy we must fulfill some requirements (e.g. having at least 2 hours of sport and in total 4 hours of camp activity per day).

The courses through universities, while often cheaper overall, are ultimately more expensive per hour of class and I think the quality is much worse. I would warn against taking any class that is less than 3 hours a week. It's basically not worth your time to go to a 1.5hr/week course. You will learn German so slowly this way that you might as well just learn it on the street. I prefer going to private language schools because they usually have professional teachers and good learning materials.   Ultimately it will come down to your teacher. In the beginning don't be afraid to switch from one school to another if you don't like the teacher. Eventually you will find a teacher that you learn well from and you can follow a wave of students with that teacher through several levels."

Maybe they have missed all these studies and are oblivious to that fact that large parts of the American population have been eating GMO's for quite some time now - who knows...) They irrationally play up some dangers (eg: nuclear power - even a cursory glance at primitive 'danger' indicators like death per unit of energy isn't all that compatible with a 'nuclear energy is really dangerous' narrative )   Idk, maybe have a look at the green liberals or don't give a shit about party at all and just evaluate candidates and vote for them regardless of party affiliation."

Yes, they say they care about the environment, but because of their anti-science beliefs they don't help it as much as they should. For instance, there are a bunch of GM crops that would help lessen the amount of pesticides we use (and use better pesticides, too), but they don't want that.

Also, as a scientist myself, I agree that GMO's seem to be not dangerous at all and this one of the very few things I dislike about the Grüne Partei, but scientifically spoken GMO's being dangerous is an existential hypothesis, meaning that you can indeed never really prove them to be not dangerous."

Their stance on GMO (in the same document) is only about labeling; sure, it's silly, but it's nowhere near as bad as the Greens. It'll be interesting to read the updated version of that document, though, since it expires this year.  Every important Green seems to have at least one fascination with pseudoscience: Luc Recordon, one of their two senators, presides an association promoting alternative medicine. Robert Cramer, their other senator, personally banned GMOs in Geneva. Daniel Brélaz, the mayor of Lausanne, is on a diet that includes... acupuncture. That isn't true of any other party, though. Some members might individually be known for silly things, but that's it.  Anyway, the Greens's positions are essentially the Socialists' positions, plus other things. So if you want to vote left-wing, it's a much better idea to vote Socialist - and try to fight against their pseudoscientific tendencies if you can - than Green."

Switzerland,31wzid,Aethec,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:15:50 2015 UTC,"Alternative medicine, by definition, refuses to apply the scientific method (i.e. make tests according to well-defined protocols and accept their results), which makes it completely unscientific. Your description of nuclear power is absurd; nuclear power is the cleanest form of energy that is available right now in unlimited quantities. Renewable energy is cool, but it's not ready to replace everything else yet.  Let me guess: You vote for the Greens?"

Maybe you have to look at their political programs first.  You do realise that nuclear energy is not renewable and therefore not unlimited? it may even last only as long as oil does. Also for being clean it should not require to dig for uranium under unethical conditions. With uranium we are dependent on other countries that most of the time have not really stable governments. Also currently there is still no solution for nuclear waste and I don't know how others think about it, but I do not like to just bury it somewhere and hope we will never come across it for the next few millions of years. To answer your question: I always split my votes between the social democrats and the green party, as I think they resemble a scientific thinking style the most.

Also, one of their two senators, Luc Recordon (VD), is president of the ""Association romande pour le développement et l’intégration des médecines complémentaires (RoMédCo)"" (source). Indirectly,  they are in favor of organic agriculture - another pseudoscience based on appeals to nature -, which requires farmers to use alternative medicine on animals before trying real medicine (source (French) / source (German)).  About nuclear, yes, it's not perfect, but right now it's the best we have. Coal is far worse on all amounts (including radioactive waste!). Solar, wind, and other renewable energies are promising, but nowhere near what we need to run entirely on them.

Edit: this kind of scam: http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/fraud-az-recruitment-scams  If you want PM me some company names (or simply post em), so I can see if at least the companies are legit.  Edit2: It really depends on your skills and experience, but I guess with 10 year experience in IT, in a domain that is not that seldom, with a university degree and with no leadership function, payment would be around 7K to 12K per month, 13x in a year.

It's slightly above what I've usually seen when working through a intermediary (most rates I've seen are at around 850 a day). I remember working for a higher amount a day for a while, so this is well within a reasonable range.   Intermediaries are common for larger companies such as banks and insurances, ask the bank directly if this is the intermediary they are working with if you're not sure. (or pm me, I can see what I can do)  Oh dear - I just saw that UK LTD Company you linked. LOL. No man. Big Swiss bank with a 2 year old LTD from UK? I think not."

Both he should be able to name, should not be any big secret, considering I have been working for banks before as a Consultant (was like any other client). Which you could look up I bet. True I cannot understand why a big bank would use a 2 year old Company to find skilled people, then again, if someone leaves their old Company to start a new one, most of the time they bring over their clients.

Recruiters will often oversell, so that can explain it too. They want your interest and somewhere down the line it turns out that that the 1k is the top end of a spectrum and in reality it could be quite a bit less.   And yes basically they can let you go at a moments notice. So there is always that risk.  I'd say pursue it, definitely. Just do your due diligence in making sure it's all legit, and most importantly don't spend the money until you've got it.

Also keep in mind that the 1000/month jobs others are talking about are for really high-level software engineers at really big banks. I don't know if that matches your credentials or not (I never heard of ""client deployment and client management specialists"").

Switzerland,31vu1n,ghstw,2,Wed Apr 8 16:16:50 2015 UTC,"Look up IT contracting, it's been a thing for some time :)  Former co-worker did that for 16+k a month. So he worked a few months and then went back to vacation in Cuba. When he ran out of money he came back - rinse and repeat. Guy is way past 40 years old."
Switzerland,31vu1n,whitepalms85,4,Wed Apr 8 18:11:35 2015 UTC,"220k for corporate contracting around ZH is still in a reasonable range. Headhunters advertise the best opportunity, so you might still get dealed down. Also you'd still have to go to interviews.   Switzerland is awesome for contracting.  However depending on the contracting company they can fire you within 1-4 weeks notice tim, but usually never happens.   If you get a 12-14month contract you'd be pretty safe.   Company usually handles all paperwork and you get 5y B permit to stay from the EU.   And yes 15% tax."
Switzerland,31vu1n,whitepalms85,3,Wed Apr 8 23:21:50 2015 UTC,"An small Update:  First, thank for everyone who helped me with this, for the feedback and for frankly being really helpful. Must say that idlestabilizer - you da real MVP! and I wish I could send all of you a nice beer for tonights afterwork, it being Friday and all.  It looks like a Scam alright, I spent some more time yesterday looking around and idlestabilizer found some information that made this 'headhunting company' look more than shady. (again, you da real MVP).  I also asked a Senior Consultant we have onsite for a Project about this, since he have 25+ years of working as a Consultant/Contractor around the world as an IT-professional, mostly Europe and Asia. Let him take a look at the mail conversation and the more or less said ""scam"" within the first 30 seconds of reading.  He gave me a few tips and told me to bail on the Skype/phone interview I had scheduled yesterday, but to Word it like I was still very interested (I would very much be if it was real) but asked a few questions. Name if intermidiary Company so that I could ask them a few questions, what the end Client really was (should be no secret, tons of finance institutes/banks has jobadds on monster.ch etc) and when in the process I would meet them since I truly would never sign a contract without meeting my future boss and coworkers.  Guess what? I got no answer. Earlier I got replies within 10 minutes of mailing to the recruiter, now nothing. If I was as they clamied ""a good candidate"" they would have replied with answers and a new time for meeting.  Also got asked in a PM what my Skillsets was that I had posted on Linkedin so:  10 years in IT, however University Degree in Industrial Design, life just took me down another path in the end. Server from Windows Server 2003 and up Client from Windows XP and up - Currently managing 3500 Windows desktops. RIS, WDS, MDT, SCCM for OS deployment since 2006, MDT being my OS deployment weapon of choise since 2008ish. VDI solutions using VMWare Horizon View.  And pretty much everything inbetween or related to distributing OS and Applications to clients and servers."
Switzerland,31vu1n,royalbarnacle,3,Fri Apr 10 08:36:02 2015 UTC,"Im a technology consultant here in Switzerland in the financial service industry and 1000 CHF per day is not unheard off specially if you have 5+ years of experience.   I'm on salary but if I would become a contractor I could expect 800 to 1000 CHF per day.  Being a contractor they could terminate you instantly but this does normally not happen if the project has sufficient budget and you do good work.  Many times if the client likes your work, they will offer you a fulltime salaried position at their company.  Feel free to PM the clients name and I can provide some feedback on the client and its projects"
Switzerland,31vu1n,whitepalms85,3,Wed Apr 8 18:36:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know, a friend of mine worked as a contractor for a few months for a bank and earned between 15-20k per month (and hasn't a very crazy profile or so, just some specific IT skills the bank apparently really needed). Keep in mind that CHF 1000/day seems high but e.g. lawyers and consultants often bill that clients for 2-4 hours of work. So it's not totally unrealistic but there are still a few points that make me a bit skeptical.    a British Headhunting company   It's a bit odd that a Swiss bank would deal with a small, not very famous British head hunter. Not impossible, but a bit unusual.   the offer was at start 12 months with up to 24/36 months   That seems very long. Consultants usually aren't brought in for such long periods. The firm could just recruit you directly.    tax at 15%   That seems very low. As an employee you paid ~10% of your salary social taxes and then on top of that another 10% income tax at the end of the year. But with a 20+k income/month this increases to 25% income tax or so. However, if you work as a independent consultant, then you're basically a company. Depending on the company type you either have to pay profit taxes and then income taxes on dividends or with some company types you pay the same as explained above (you're an employee of your own firm).    I would work through a Swiss Intermediary that he (the headhunter) would use for payroll and back office functions   I don't think this is unusual. Basically you won't be employed by the financial firm but work for them as some kind of consultant. But you have to be employed somewhere, that's why they use some entity/intermediary.    workdays would be mon-fri, 09.00-17.30    The Swiss aren't too crazy about working hours but that seems very low. Work usually starts at 8am and I think for CHF 1000/day they expect you to work longer than 17.30. 8 to 5 (including a 1 hour lunch break) are basically the standard lazy office clerk hours, not the top IT contractor hours...   Could they just terminate me after a few weeks   Possibly. Usually contractors are making a lot of money when there is high demand but they are also the first ones that have to leave because they aren't employees. It's kind of high risk, high reward. But ultimately it just depends on the contract. Basically if they buy one year of consultant service from your employer (the intermediary) then you're good. But maybe it's just an on-demand contract where they only have to pay when you come in and if they don't need you anymore then they won't ask you to come in and hence you won't get paid.   rental contract that costs ASS    Well, there are short term contracts too that have shorter notice periods. However, they are usually more expensive.   1500-3500CHF a month to rent a flat    Sounds about right, especially for Zurich and Geneva   I have a first phone/skype interview tomorrow, but I guess if they are interested they would like to meet in person.   You will find out soon enough. If this is serious and for a financial firm it's indeed very likely that they will want to meet you. I mean try to view it from their perspective: you could be a fraud too.  As long as you don't have to pay anything, you don't really have to lose anything anyway. Just don't pay any 'relocation fees' or any kind of fees to the recruiter or something stupid like that (no offense but that's how the fraud cases would work)."

Yes, of course I could be a scam from their point. I did however point out from the start that the help they claim to need, is not a 12 month job, it is more or less 12 days, and alot of those would just be verification tests which frankly most of the time takes at most hours, not days.  On another note, most of the flats that was out for rent, and there was quite the number, at most stated they had ISDN.. is internet access restricted to glorified modems? :( Of course, I am from Sweden, one of the pioneers in internet connectivity for everyone - even my parents, out in the more or less hillbilly wilderness has 100mbit fiber."

Switzerland,31vu1n,futurespice,0,Wed Apr 8 20:00:13 2015 UTC,"That sounds better then ISDN!

I am going to do an evaluation for the University between Airwatch and Intune+CM sometime this fall after we finished with all our other Projects.  How far seems the IT strategy be in Switzerland? Still companies running XP, dreading the move to Windows 7 (which already is getting to old) and fearing 8.1/10?

I can't say anything specific about the recruiter but just from my general experience with recruiters: They often don't know anything and just say things to make them sound as if they would know what they are talking about. It's more relevant what the experts you will be working with say.   My biggest fear is that they will be running on an fairly old infrastructure    I worked for some Swiss bank (but not IT) and from my experience their infrastructure is often very old."

I'm not sure how it works when you're not a Swiss citizen, but there are things like social insurance which you then have to pay by yourself which would otherwise be partly paid by your employer.  Also, keep in mind that you will have to pay other expenses by yourself, e.g. travel expenses, phone bills, etc..."
Switzerland,31zp3j,thenewsmg,4,Thu Apr 9 12:34:52 2015 UTC,I think it's unlikely to get a job if you don't speak German or French and have no experience and no international connections.  Why would anyone want to hire you over a Swiss or German guy coming from University? Having all the extra hassle and cost for foreigners outside of the EU. That's the question you have to answer.  But that's just my opinion and I'm not a hiring guy or work in finance.
Switzerland,31zp3j,lclc_,2,Thu Apr 9 14:25:37 2015 UTC,"It's not unrealistic I think. Formally, I think you need to have a skill that is demonstrably lacking in Switzerland for a company to be able to sponsor your work permit. However, it's up to the company in question and not something that needs to be proven as such, as far as I know.  When it comes to the MBA, whatever the major, make sure it's internationally recognized and accredited. Look at websites like www.jobs.ch and setup an account on www.xing.com to get an idea of what kind of positions are available here.  Other advice, learn some basic German. I'd say improve English also, but I see your written English is much better than average, so perhaps you don't need to."

Switzerland,31roiq,YeaISeddit,6,Tue Apr 7 19:43:19 2015 UTC,"I think the parody fell very flat with me because they just took a whole bunch of ""American"" stereotypes and rolled them into one without taking into account the vast differences between Americans from different regions.  You'd think the Swiss, of all people, should be able to understand that regional cultural differences create different attitudes amongst a population.  If they'd have just parodied the Californian or the Southern or the North Eastern American, then it may have actually had some continuity and been good.  Also, the only place I've read that the parody is ""getting attention from Americans because they find it offensive"" is in Swiss media.  I haven't heard a peep about it in American media, and none of my American friends or family have heard of this parody.  Plus, ya know, Americans are pretty self-deprecating and are used to comedy ripping us apart.  The only offensive thing I notice about the parody is that it wasn't very good."

Back to the drawing board I assume and another vote on the second draft. etc. etc.? When does it end and isn't that just delaying things more and more?  I like point 4 that would introduce the 'Gesetzesinitiative' on the national level. It's a cool idea and would give more control to the public while avoiding a bloated constitution. Also I don't like my constitution to having to mention minarets and cervelas (I actually am not sure if cervelas are mentioned in the constitution).. use laws for the details.  Point 5 is interesting, but I wonder.. wouldn't that introduce even more delays and maybe even more voting dates? I think it's possible to get informed on all the measures in time today anyway.

I can see a lot of scenarios where a vote causes the losers to become more interested to block the decision and if the winners aren't careful and motivated the second time their vote can still be reversed by the sore losers. Also I doubt that the second (or third or fourth) time around there will be a lot of people showing up to vote, which is unfortunate, but clearly these votes will be valued less by the people.

BTW in the 70s, when women got the right to vote, this figure was logically halved (3% to 1,5%) and after ~6 years it was increased to ~2,6%.  also, did you see that point 4. may compensate for the increase in difficulty?"

(and 1.), which should be the ones discussed as potentially antidemocratic (and are not IMO). point 5. directly allows only that voters can better focus."

If prolonging people's lives in unnatural ways (i.e. heart/lung machines) without their consent is legal, why should assisting them in ending it not be when it is their will? I don't even understand how it can be made illegal to provide the means for someone to end their lives, I mean technically, this would have to be an explicitly stated law, wouldn't it? Otherwise any instrument that someone uses for suicide (say, a rope) that you provided, even unknowingly, could get you into trouble. Why would lawmakers go through the troubles of making such laws? Living in a free society means that you should be able to do anything you want, as long as it's not at the expense of others."

(it can sometimes happen that a cable somewhere is damaged and thus the connection to a couple websites is bad for a few days due to this; if it has been going on for a few weeks, then it's probably not just a cable failure somewhere) Do other swisscom customers experience the same thing?

In the past i have used 8.8.8.8 When running traceroute with the router DNS (192.168.1.1) and Google (8.8.8.8) they both take a really long time to find the end server. I suggest others to try the Glasnost test, but for me it was negative."
Switzerland,31mf1t,fffmmm,2,Mon Apr 6 15:55:31 2015 UTC,"Let's say you do a traceroute to r8---sn-4g57kue6.googlevideo.com (that's one of the server that serves youtube videos and not the html/css/js part of youtube), can you see a hop in there after which time goes up by a lot and stays high for all subsequent nodes (from  less than 100ms to a few hundred ms) ?

Switzerland,31mf1t,korky1318,2,Mon Apr 6 19:26:34 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, google doesn't pay Swisscom as of right now.  Maybe to start off: peering is the idea that two (or more) groups connect their networks somewhere to allow data-exchange between the two networks. This is made that for example a Swisscom user can communicate with a cablecom user instead of swisscom users only being able to communicate with no one but other swisscom users. This is quite literally a few cables that you plug from a router in one network to a router in another network. Peering is done without either party paying the other for the traffic that occurs: it's a ""your customers now have access to my network and mine have access to your network"" kind of deal. (Aside of peering, there's also transit, but that's irrelevant here).  Now as you can imagine, netflix, google and co send a lot more traffic in to the Swisscom network than the Swisscom network sends out to them (The packets requesting the movie from netflix/youtube/??? are a lot smaller and usually also fewer than the packets containing the movie). In addition to that, Swisscom has a lot of customers and wouldn't it be a pity if your video-platform (or whatever) was really slow for swisscom customers?  Swisscom isn't stupid and thus they went to init7 and basically said ""wouldn't it be a pity if you were to lose access to our network or if your access to our network would be really shitty? But hey, rejoice for you could just pay us money and we will in return we don't deny you peering access to our network"". Thereby Swisscom wouldn't only make their customers pay for what they request, but they'd also make those who serve those requests pay. They'd get paid twice, but only do the work once. Init7 wasn't entirely sure if they could even afford the exorbitant sums of money that Swisscom wanted and were not okay with Swisscom trying to pressure them to pay for something that's always been free for both parties. That's when init7 filed a complaint and later won in court. Since then Swisscom behaved as far as I know.  In the USA where there's more of a duopoly situation than in Switzerland, the big Providers have successfully pressured some content providers - like netflix - in to paying them money and they were not stopped by a court. They just let the interconnection between the network that is used by spotify and their network completely clog up at which point netflix' video quality massively degraded for customers of those ISPs and it had to buffer a lot. The ISPs could litterally have solved this problem by just plugging a few cabled from netflix' network to theirs - that would have only taken a few minutes and cost at most a one time fee of a few thousand dollars for hardware (level3 even offered to pay those few thousands for the hardware to these ISPs - at which point it would have literally been completely free for them). Yet they deliberately chose not to plug those additional cables - they wanted netflix to pay them money for the traffic and only after that $$$ arrived they'd plug some additional cables.  On a positive note: Swisscom didn't get away with it and aside of that I don't know of any questionable thing they tried to pull. Oh and their customer support is the best I have used so far (internet of a relative broke and I was asked if I could fix it) - the support staff knew what they were talking about and the problem was found pretty fast (router HW broke for some reason).  [Disclaimer: I neither employed, nor have I ever been employed by either side of this conflict (swisscom, init7). I am not even a customer of either, don't hold any stock nor do I have family working for either. I don't want my internet to be shitty and that's why I point it out when an ISP tries to get aways with something questionable.]"

Google wants to get its content to you as fast as possible, so it'll get better soon (it is Magical Jesus Monday, after all :P).  The peering agreements between the SWITCH network and Google is different than the one between Google and Swisscom. Part of most of those peering agreements is a clause where Google colocates a content cache in the PoP where they meet. Probably what is happening now is one or both of the following:  a) everyone getting back from vacation wants to watch Netflix (is that in CH yet?) / youtube / other content, and are overloading Swisscom's network and the Google cache at the PoP with Swisscom  b) all the students normally bogging down your university's network are getting hammered in Ibiza (or not? Not sure if CH spring break is as debaucherous as the spectacle in the US), so the Google cache at the PoP with SWITCH is better."

Switzerland,31in0y,Cubassss,13,Sun Apr 5 13:24:50 2015 UTC,"I am currently studying biochemistry at ETH, did both my bachelor and my master here.  The thoughest time are the first two years of bachelor, which are filled with a lot of lectures, with 1-2 days of practicals courses per week. In the third year it shifts to a lot of practical work where rotate every so many weeks to another lab. I found this very nice, because you will learn a lot from different areas and get a better feeling for what you like or not. Plus you can already get contact to the labs in which you might want to do your projects during the masters degree.    Then in the Masters, you ll have to do 2 semester projects for 3 months each and a master thesis for 6 months. And get some points for some lectures. You have to chose a specialization, like biochemistry, cell biology or what not. Your lectures will be based on this specialization. However for your projects you can also go into a completely other direction. For example, I am in the specialization of (cell) biochemistry, however I did one of my projects in tissue engineering and my thesis in molecular biology.  I dunno if that has helped you somewhat. If not feel free to ask!"
Switzerland,31in0y,fishwithabicycle,1 point,Sun Apr 5 15:29:46 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is actually exacly what i was looking for when posting this! I was thinking of doing biochemistry there too and was a little bit worried about the math part and about how practical things are. And  i actually have a question: are the first year of biology/chemistry/biochemistry summarized in a single course or are those 3 completely different courses from the beginning? I couldn't find a direct answer for this on the website..."
Switzerland,31in0y,fishwithabicycle,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:48:37 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the practical things! In the first year you will work in a group of 2 to 3 people and have a quite personalized supervision!  About the Math part... well it depends where you are from and what you already did in highschool. I had for example already seen some of the math stuff in highschool that my swiss colleagues didn't so it was easier for me ;)  Chemistry and biology are different courses. Biochemistry is included in the biology course.  They changed a bit the biology course, so it's different now from how it was when I started. What I know so far is that you will start with a broad basis of biology (from plant to cell biology, neurology, biochemistry), maths, physic, and chemistry. I think in the second semester you can start choosing ""Wahlfächer"" from three different modules:   1) biodiversity,   2) cellular and molecular biology and   3)biological chemistry.   When you want to do biochemistry, I would choose lectures from the last two modules (especially organic chemistry!).  A useful link is www.vvz.ethz.ch . You can check out the lectures from previous semesters with a short description. I helped me a lot in my deciding to come here to ETH.   Just a fair warning, as somebody else already mentionned, you won't have much of a summer in the first two years. Exams are always in August, and you first exams will only be after a full year (no exams after the first autumn semester) and, believe me, it will be A LOT!! On the other hand I guess it is not that different at other universities."
Switzerland,31in0y,fishwithabicycle,2,Mon Apr 6 17:13:38 2015 UTC,"To get that straight: if i want to study biochemistry i have to start the biology course and choose some biochem-specific wahlfächer? and yea my math is pure garbage, i studied in switzerland and wasn't able to pass it in high scool. But i kind of got talent in anything else science related, a friend of mine said it would be possible to pass the first years if do get good grades in the other areas. what do you think?"
Switzerland,31in0y,fishwithabicycle,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:26:23 2015 UTC,"First of all, having good grades in highschool doesn't necessarily mean you'll have good grades in college, and the opposite is also true. That being said, if you rock your biology and chemistry exams, you'll be able to compensate for math! I sucked at some exams during the basis pürfung  and could save me with biology! After the Basis Prüfung you will no longer have ""Blockprüfungen"" and each exam counts for itself, so that you will no longer be able to compensate. Luckily, you won't have any maths after the Basisprüfung ;)"
Switzerland,31in0y,fishwithabicycle,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:36:18 2015 UTC,does that mean that i would only have 1 year of math at the ETH? that sounds awesome :D!  Btw: could you describe a difference between the ETH and the UZH? is it really just the difficulty?

Switzerland,31in0y,bragis,7,Mon Apr 6 17:36:43 2015 UTC,Just finished my bachelor degree in mechanical engineering. So I can answer more general questions. I'm swiss btw so in case you're from abroad I might not be able to answer questions regarding application stuff
Switzerland,31in0y,Zombie46,2,Sun Apr 5 14:22:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hijack from OP, but I'm thinking about taking my masters in mechanical engineering in ETH in the next couple of years.   I've (almost) got a BS from an Icelandic university, and will be working for at least a year before going back to school.   Couple of questions. How expensive is it ? Fees, accommodation, food etc.  Are there a lot of ""on hands"" classes where you don't just design stuff, but make it also ?   Is a mechanical engineering degree from ETH better than similar degrees from other schools ?   What is the general atmosphere like ?   Sorry for throwing out really general questions, but when I visited ETH in February these were the sort of questions I couldn't get a straight answer for from the brochures."
Switzerland,31in0y,bragis,2,Sun Apr 5 23:50:34 2015 UTC,"Ok so to start off, I won't start my master studies until september.  This page contains a lot of information about general stuff, such as cost of living and so on. Tuition is with 644CHF a small amount, living and food will make up most of your costs. Plus stuff like health insurance and so on but you can find most of the info on that page. There are cheap-ish rooms that are subsidized by ETH that you might be able to get, they have a dorm kind of feeling (like 4+ people in an apartment sharing kitchen/bathroom kind of thing).  The classes in general are very much on the theoretical side. Depending on the focus you choose, there might be certain classes that you can pick that do have more hands on components. Additionally, you'll have to do a semester project which you have lots of options to actually make something and one third of the master studies are the master thesis which again is a huge project that offers lots of possibilities. This is all assuming you do a general mechanical engineering degree. There are specialized programs (such as robotics or nuclear energy) that usually have special rules. They also have a limited number of spots and sometimes are hard to get into (robotics has something like 40 spots for a couple of hundred applications).  ETH has an excellent reputation. In the academic world it will help you to have a degree from here. International rankings set ETH as best in continental europe and internationally the best non-US and non-UK university. If you want to work in switzerland it will also help you a lot. I'm not very sure how the situation is in the rest of the world. While the quality is really good, it might not be  known all over the world when it comes to jobs.  The atmosphere is really good in my opinion. However, most people are swiss and as I've heard from many exchange/foreign students, it's really hard to make swiss friends. I'm very open about meeting people from abroad but that doesn't seem to be the norm so most foreigners are friends with other foreigners. I'm not sure how things are in iceland but people here very often like to keep to themselves and if you have a different mentality that might come off as rude or even hostile. I always say, it's hard to break the ice with swiss people, it's kind of easy to make acquaintances and it's very hard to make real friends but if you make a swiss friend, you very often make them for life.  I hope this helped and please feel free to ask more questions or if you want me to get into more details on anything I've mentioned!"

Switzerland,31in0y,seitgeist,2,Wed Apr 8 11:16:32 2015 UTC,"It is hard. Very hard. Afaik it's among the hardest majors at ETH. But you get used to it. And while being hard, it's certainly doable. It depends on you after all!  You do have a shitton of math and ETH is extreme in that regard but it's actually a good thing because if you get through it, all the other classes (fluiddynamics, thermodynamics, control systems) where you tend to need a lot of those things are just learning new concepts and the execution is a piece of cake. I highly recommend doing it, I absolutely loved it even if the first year had quite a few dry classes. You just have to remember that you need to learn how to walk before you can run ;)  And 40% failing quota means 60% pass. And almost all of the people that repeat their first year pass. Most people that drop out do so because they get frustrated and quit, not because they fail their Basisjahr twice so if you really want to do it, you most probably will succeed.   I don't know if you've already decided on another Studienrichtung but if now, give it another thought!"

(The calculation is based on the assumption that we have close to 5 millions people who are allowed to vote). That would be something they should fix, but nobody wants to touch a unpopular topic like this, because he would be against the freedom to vote about everything!

No relevant political party can afford to straight up fully oppose the federal council (the federal council has a united opinion determined by internal votes) because 1, they are all (except the green party) members of the federal council and 2, if they would, the other parties would punish them for it in the next government election and they would eventially lose one or both of their seats in the council."

Da es sich jedoch um keine Vollerhebung wie beim Seco, sondern um eine Stichprobe handelt, sind andere statistische Fehler enthalten.

Either go there with a lawyer - who will tell you not to answer any questions or go there alone (you should be able to go there alone, possibly even accompanied by your parents since you're a minor. The only thing you should tell them (THIS IS IMPORTANT!) is ""Ich verweigere die Aussage"" or ""Keine Aussage"". They are currently fishing and will tell you to ""be honest so the sentence won't be hard"" and stuff like that. DO NOT break.  Don't worry, even if you end up having to do social work or go to some drug courses, it doesn't matter in the long run."

Switzerland,30wwm5,omega6244,7,Tue Mar 31 16:18:39 2015 UTC,"Ich werd' dir mal auf Deutsch antworten, ist einfacher. Du wirst nicht vor einem Gericht erscheinen müssen, schon gar nicht als Minderjähriger. Der Staatsanwalt wird dir, wenn er zum Schluss kommt, dass dir ein strafbares Verhalten nachgewiesen werden kann, einen Strafbefehl ausstellen, d.h. du wirst bloss mittels einem Stück Papier verurteilt, siehst also niemals einen Richter, sparst so aber natürlich auch Verfahrenskosten. Selbst vor Gericht hast du als Beschuldigter (das ist nicht dasselbe wie Zeuge, Gutachter, ist für deinen Fall aber irrelevant) immer das Recht, die Aussage zu verweigern.    Ich kann nur wiederholen und betonen: Du kannst NUR verlieren, wenn du bei der Polizei aussagst. Du solltest freundlich aber bestimmt auf jede Frage der Polizei (ausser Fragen zum Name, Beruf, Adresse usw.) antworten, dass du keine Aussage machen möchtest. Glaub' mir - das ist einfacher gesagt als getan, die Polizisten sind keine Idioten (umstritten) und werden mit perfiden Tricks versuchen, dich zu einer für sie verwertbare Aussage zu bringen. Nun bist du allerdings noch minderjährig, das heisst dir kommen prozessual einige besondere Rechte zu, ich habe allerdings momentan nicht die Zeit dir das nachzuschauen. Lies' dir aber doch mal die Jugendstrafprozessordnung (JStPO) durch, ist sicher auch gute Allgemeinbildung :-)  Die Frage ob Hanfsamen per se illegal sind, kann ich dir leider so auf die Schnelle nicht beantworten - ich wäre mir allerdings nicht so sicher. Tendenziell hätte ich gedacht eher nein, aber ich weiss es nicht so genau. Schau und frag doch einmal in einem Schweizer Hanf-/Kifferforum nach, ich bin sicher du bist nicht der Erste dem das passiert und auch wenn die User dort wohl u.U. ein bisschen verpeilt sind, so können sie dir sicher aus Erfahrung weiterhelfen.  Sprich am besten auch noch mit deinen Eltern, evtl. könnt oder wollt ihr einen Anwalt beiziehen. Da du noch minderjährig bist verknacken sie dich wohl am ehesten wie oben erwähnt zu Sozialstunden oder du musst irgendeinen Drogenpräventionskurs besuchen.  Alle Angaben nach besten Gewissen aber ohne Gewähr."

Switzerland,30wwm5,seraph121,7,Tue Mar 31 19:15:03 2015 UTC,"Habe das hier in einem Forum gefunden: ""Hanf samen sind in der Schweiz legal, wenn der Staat nicht davon ausgehen muss, dass der Besitz dem Anbau von Rauschgift dient. Wenn du also bei der Kontrolle ein Bob Marley Shirt trägst: nicht gut. Im Prinzip überlässt dies Bundesgesetz es dem Ermessen der kantonalen Behörden, Samenbesitz zu verfolgen oder eben nicht. Ähnlich wie bei der Festlegung dessen, was ""geringfügige Mengen"" sind. In einem Kanton war schon ein Gramm nicht mehr geringfügig (Solothurn), ein anderer Kanton (Basel) befand, 4 Kilo Gras seien geringfügig - was allerdings das Bundesgericht negierte.  Theoretisch können sie dich wegen Seeds verklagen und sie dir wegnehmen. In der Praxis sieht es zur Zeit so aus, als liesse man die Grower in Ruhe, damit der Schwarzhandel von der Selbstversorgung verdrängt wird, was ja eigentlich gut ist. Das kann sich aber schnell ändern. Zudem gibt es noch den Aspekt, dass bald über die Hanf-Initiative abgestimmt wird. ""Der Staat"" versucht nun offensichtlich durch viel Toleranz, den Kiffern den Wind aus den Segeln zu nehmen, im Sinne von ""ist ja gar nicht nötig"".  Was die Datensicherheit der Growshops betrifft, so kann ich nur berichten von dem Fall eines bekannten Zürcher Shops, wo die Polizei mehrfach versuchte, an die Kundendaten heranzukommen, inklusive unangekündigte Hausdurchsuchungen.  Erinnert euch auch an die Sache mit den Kundendaten von Lichtensteiner Banken... Könnte hier auch leicht passieren, was in der Art. Vor allem, wenn die Regierung mal eben etwas Action und einen Sündenbock für die 20 Uhr News braucht. Haschisch-Fixer-Hatz...nichts neues, wie wir wissen.  Grundsätzlich lässt sich sagen: Selbstversorgung und Grow-Shops werden heute mehr oder weniger toleriert, man sollte aber weder seine Plants noch seine Seeds einem Beamten unter die Nase reiben! Der müsste sie dann wegnehmen.  PS Nachtrag: Tipp zum Umgang mit Kundendaten: Wer online Seeds kauft und per Kreditkarte bezahlt, hinterlässt eine Spur, die alle möglichen Schnüffeldienste weltweit ausspähen können. Dass die Polizei aber Kreditkartendaten bei solch relativen Bagatelldelikten verwendet, ist zumindest heute noch eher unwahrscheinlich. Sicherer wäre es auf jeden Fall, die Seeds anonym und persönlich im Ladenlokal zu kaufen. Oder online Bestellung mit Cash Vorkasse. Auf jeden Fall solltet ihr den Growshop anweisen, eure Kundedaten sofort nach Transaktion und Versand zu löschen."""

Besser ist, die Aussage zu verweigern oder eine plausible Erklärung abzuliefern. Am besten fragst du bei einem Anwalt nach, inwieweit du dich strafbar gemacht hast mit der Einfuhr dieser Samen.

Bei den Hanfsamen stellt sich natürlich das Problem, dass diese noch kein THC enthalten.

Hier sind wir gespannt, wie die Untersuchungsbehörden einem Hanfsamen beweisen wollen, dass er eine Pflanze mit mehr als 1.0% THC wird.

Switzerland,30wwm5,Skinnj,3,Tue Mar 31 16:02:35 2015 UTC,"The question is only wether you want to risk to be caught lying.  1) You claim you ordered these seeds to grow cannabis because you like the look of the plant and you would like to fabricate hemprope or something. Not very convincing.  2) You don't say anything towards why you use it and ask what made them confiscating it and why they think it's being intended for illegal use. You don't have to say anything that is putting you into a conflict.  3) You claim to not have known that it's illegal to posess seeds because you ordered them from an online shop. Play naive. Not very convincing either.  4) You ask them first what happens if you WOULD admit to growing them for personal use. They have to answer you truthfully what happens in each case. Also ask what happens if you DONT say anything. It's fully in your rights to not make a statement at all, and normally  police doesnt want to bother with that kind of petty stuff if they can avoid it.  In any case: Stay friendly and polite, don't be a wiseass, if you respect them they will cut you slack as well, but don't say more than you have to. If you go full disclosure make perfectly clear that you don't intend to sell weed or something and that you didn't expect it to be such a big deal and act shocked, also try to make a responsible impression. That might be convincing and honest.  Try not to get caught in a lie, thats worse than not saying anything by the way. If you're shitless scared only admit that they are yours (if you paid with a credit card and it's delivered to your house they can prove that anyway) and that you don't want to make a statement because you fear that you could put yourself in trouble. (Again, friendly, not cocky)  In the end you're in switzerland, they won't behead you and the worst that happens is a fine and your seeds taken away maybe some courses but idk.  Bonus: Call sensiseed on their helpline, i'm sure they don't hear this question for the first time :P"
Switzerland,30wwm5,_Ganjalf,4,Tue Mar 31 11:34:46 2015 UTC,"I would like to add to this post.   I don't think that you will have an interrogation at all, it will probably be a ""Strafbefehl"" with a sentence that you can accept, pay and move on, or go to court (which will be more expensive, definitely result in a questioning and take a while. I'm not a lawyer so I don't know about the chances of a reduced sentence, but with the applied knowledge of law that I have I would describe them as ""marginally at best"". However, should it come to a questioning..  You basically have three options: Lie, tell the truth, don't say anything.   Never ever lie to the police in an interrogation. Think about it this way: If people could get away with lying to the police, why even bother having interrogations before it goes to court? Even if they can't prove that you lied, they will still know it and make a note. While that will most likely not have any negative impact on the eventual verdict, it will still mean that they will cut you zero slack and they will be as annoying as they feel like towards you.   Remaining silent is your right. It will not help you, but you can't fuck anything up either. Nobody will bother too much, standard sentence.   Being honest is your best option, as long as you are not making things worse for yourself. ""Yes, I ordered those seeds."" is an example of honesty that will not hurt you. ""Yes, I intended to grow the plants to smoke them"" is an example of making things worse for yourself.   My recommendation: Confess everything you did up to the phone call, remain silent when they ask you why you did it.   Also, to clear up some common misconceptions:   They have to answer you truthfully what happens in each case.   No, they will answer with ""I don't know, I'm not a judge"". The police have no power over what will happen, all they do is get all the facts and report it to the Staatsanwaltschaft.    Stay friendly and polite, don't be a wiseass   This should be the base for any human interaction, but especially in your case you can destroy a lot of goodwill if you act like an asshole. You are young, you made a bad decision, nobody was hurt. Literally everyone can relate, not everyone was caught though. The police see worse everyday.   I'm 17 at the moment and turn 18 in July, so I'd be 18 when the plants are ready for harvest.   The second part is irrelevant. You were a minor when you ordered the seeds, so you will be judged as a minor. This means an easier sentence.   If you are worried about your criminal record.. don't be. In order to get a public entry in your criminal record ( ""Strafregisterauszug"" ) you have to do a lot worse than you did. You may get an entry in the police-journal, but that has zero consequences except that they are more likely to pat you down in a control / have you do a drugwipe at a traffic stop. But since you are a minor I'm not even sure that you will have an entry at all, and even then it would be limited to your canton."

Sure, they'd have the burden of proof, but that's not very difficult to do with an online order (and they probably have the proof already), but any additional cost that would incur from such actions are very likely to be added to the sentence.   His only potential way out would be for someone else to come forward and say that it was them who ordered the seeds, but if he was my son I wouldn't take his bullet. His mess, his duty to clean it up. And it's not even such a big mess."

Switzerland,30wwm5,weirdbreh,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:33:26 2015 UTC,"I know, and you are right.   The thing is, while talking to the police has the risk of further incriminating yourself, it also has the potential benefit of a reduced sentence because you were understanding of your wrongdoings and cooperative with law enforcement. It's up to you how you weigh those risks and benefits."
Switzerland,30tzn4,booOfBorg,3,Mon Mar 30 18:23:06 2015 UTC,"Alpstein is really cool, you can walk ""around"" it starting from the Aescher restaurant near Ebenalp over Mesmer-Ageteplatte-Seealpsee and down to Wasserauen.  A cool two-day trip I did with a friend was the Cavardirashütte in GR, start from Disentis, climb and climb and climb in altitude, sleep in the hut, and the next day, descend to Sumvitg. This is an alpine hike though (white-blue-white markings), climbs up to almost 3000 meters and there is a part where you have to climb via a chain up to a crest. The last part to the hut follows a marked trail on glacier ice, so bring your crampons!  Another nice destination from Zürich are the Churfirsten, a good mix of green and grey there, and you can do as many as you like in one day (there are seven summits altogether, I think).  Chaiserstuel near Engelberg is nice, too!"

Switzerland,30sjti,Chrisixx,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:19:13 2015 UTC,I was surprised that 2-3 of them still mentioned god. I guess I like A and E best (my vote goes to A). But honestly I don't really care...
Switzerland,30sjti,furbyhater,13,Mon Mar 30 22:10:24 2015 UTC,Does anyone else feel like our national anthem is a little too sad/churchy? I'd love a slightly more upbeat one like the Italian Anthem
Switzerland,30sjti,SwissBliss,13,Mon Mar 30 12:38:28 2015 UTC,"The French version sounds churchish; the German one is full-on groveling. Check out the translation in English if you need to, it's somewhat accurate at conveying the ""God dwelleth in the Glory of the Sun over the Alps, pray to your creator, brief mortals"" meaning behind the song. 'tis a wonderful thing to write and sing as a cistercian monk in Aargau, but I don't really think it befits our country these days...  All of that would still be okay if the anthem were actually good at anything like raising some kind of emotion, which it doesn't really. It's boring.  IMO the most serious contender for the title of true national anthem of Switzerland is Le Ranz des Vaches de la Gruyère. You can hardly get more Swiss than a song about gathering cows on a mountain pasture, and it's been making grown men cry for the past two hundred years. Legend has it the very word ""nostalgia"" had to be coined to describe the Swiss' reaction to that song. Why somebody would want to use any other is somewhat beyond me, apart from its lack of dynamism."

It's just a private group that wants to change the anthem but the vote on this site really has no relevance. There probably has to be a referendum for a change of the anthem anyways.

Switzerland,30oppe,Zorthianator,29,Sun Mar 29 09:22:20 2015 UTC,"I would like to point out that a permit to buy a weapon ( ""Waffenerwerbsschein"" ) is completely different from a permit to carry a weapon ( ""Waffentragschein"" ). You are only allowed to carry your weapons on your way to and from a range, and even then you should carry it in a box / in the back of your trunk and not strapped to your waist.   Unless you are working in some potentially dangerous professions and absolutely need to carry a weapon to work (i.e. Police, some Bodyguards, driving a high-profile money transporter etc.) you will most likely not get a permit to carry."
Switzerland,30oppe,DeepBlueNemesis,15,Sun Mar 29 11:04:24 2015 UTC,"I like to differentiate between carrying and transporting.

Switzerland,30oppe,DeepBlueNemesis,9,Sun Mar 29 16:10:05 2015 UTC,Hunters have a different type of permit to carry their guns as far as I know. As a non-hunter you cannot go to random woods and shoot guns or even transport them there.
Switzerland,30oppe,Macattack278,6,Sun Mar 29 16:12:00 2015 UTC,"You need a hunting permit, and you only get that if you take special classes and pass a fairly difficult exam."

Each canton has their own process for earning a hunting licence (of which VD is the most difficult and thorough), and once you have your licence you have to follow certain rules.  Namely, never fire within 200 m of an inhabited building and always unload when not ready to fire."
Switzerland,30oppe,mwmwmwmwmmdw,1 point,Mon Mar 30 08:56:43 2015 UTC,so if you arent a hunter you must shoot your guns only at a shooting range? can you set up your own backyard range if you own the land?

Switzerland,30oppe,Marvchester,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:11:31 2015 UTC,Eh it's also a lot of stuff you do with a weapon here that kinda plays into the whole thing. For hunting you need a license and it's not much of a hobby here and the self-defense thing just wouldn't fly except in the direst of circumstances. So having the carry-permit (mind you carry not transportation) strictly regulated makes much more sense.  At least that's my 2 cents.
Switzerland,30oppe,Skinnj,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:51:12 2015 UTC,I understand that this varies based on the canton.

Just go there and speak with a range officer (Schützenmeister).  But it varies on commercial ranges. Usually you have to bring a criminal records excerpts (Strafregisterauszug). When you want to buy the ammo right there, you need to show one anyways. Sometimes you even have to bring a copy of your liability insurance (Haftpflicht). Besides this paperwork, most commercial ranges only allow handgun calibers. Best is when you call them beforehand."

Switzerland,30oppe,DeepBlueNemesis,2,Sun Mar 29 14:40:42 2015 UTC,Hmm some cops are a bit more strict. To be sure I would first see what types of guns I would buy and then adapt it accordingly.  For example if you wish to buy 1 handgun and two rifles you will have to write:   Faustfeuerwaffe for the handgun Handfeuerwaffe for the rifle.
Switzerland,30oppe,rasifiel,3,Sun Mar 29 14:42:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, right. I know there are some regional variances. Some don't like it when you want to buy three guns in the first round. Buy a single pistol first and then, with the next time, do whatever you want."

In sports shooting you have to get tons of different equipments, addons for the guns and you end basically trying to be a pro.  When you get a gun for fun as I mentioned, you will be using it for target practicing like plinking (shooting at metal targets that make noise) or thematic shooting (like shooting at images of deer or boars).

If he does not appear to be using it, you can't use your weapon either. On the other hand, if he is holding a screwdriver above his head and is rushing at you, you can shoot him because you can easily stab someone to death with a screwdriver.   Of course this is an intellectual masturbation session, in praxis you just say that he was pointing his gun at you and you are off the hook because nobody can prove you wrong. Just don't walk up to him after you shot him and shoot him twice more while he's laying on the ground, like that lady in Zurich did recently. They can prove that at least."

It has absolutely nothing to do with shooting at everything that moves: you will get into deep trouble if you treat it like paintball.  The problem arises when those weapons are taken out of the safe environment of a shooting range, and in a more mundane situation.  My post was pointing out that although the army has attempted to put safeguards in place to prevent unstable rambos from getting access to a gun, no such thing exists in civil life. That's where I see a problem."

It has absolutely nothing to do with shooting at everything that moves   I never said that but a gun is designed to cause harm. It's also totally irrelevant that you like this kind of activity. I guess my favorite sport is throwing hand grenades in crowded train stations then. So should we allow that too?!    The problem arises when those weapons are taken out of the safe environment of a shooting range, and in a more mundane situation.   I agree.   That's where I see a problem.   I agree with that too. But then you can ask yourself the question why we even allow guns for normal people because no matter what you do there's always people that won't handle guns responsibly. There are people that might buy a gun while everything is fine but years later develop psychological problems. Then you end up with crazy people having guns... great... Society can only lose from giving guns to people. E.g. knifes or cars are dangerous too but they also bring a lot of benefits. The only ""use"" guns have is that some people think it's fun shooting them (and don't even disagree that it can be fun) but increasing the risk in a society just so that some people can have fun is selfish and total nonsense."

It's not like in e.g. tennis, where you have top players that consistently outperform others. A trained shooter is certainly better than an amateur but 'professionals' among each other aren't really distinct, which kind of shows that it isn't a real skill. Just take 'Knabenschiessen' as an example. Even amateurs often outperform trained shooters there and there are never talents that win several years in a row, which shows that it's mainly luck. Try the same thing in a real sport and you will some people come in top for several years in a row. This is what you would expect when you see a real skill."

We're just very lucky to be born in such a great place.  There are many stances between uncontrolled immigration and fully blocking all immigration which the far rights seems to aim for. Especially since Switzerland always was quite a hard place to immigrate to.   and there are proofs that many wealthy societies fell under uncontrolled immigration.   I've always hear such claims but I can't think of an example in recent (or not so recent) history. Do you know of some?  I mean of course there has to be some limitation on immigration and asylum. But it's nowhere as bad as the SVP tries to claim. Especially stupid initiatives such as the Minaret ban are solving nothing and only creating more problem by their open hate for Muslims in general.   I myself feel safer here even being an immigrant. Also police and public employes are usually kind or at least Professional.   That's good to hear and I'm glad you enjoy this country.

Well the SVP is the strongest party at the moment, so they are hardly a loud minority. But of course it also doesn't mean that everyone who votes for them supports the most extreme position of some party member.  While Switzerland generally has some xenophobic tendencies it's not the obvious racism. We don't have people on the street attacking foreigner, neither physically nor verbally. And as you said the police itself is hardly showing racism. Especially if you compare to the US for example.  But what I've mentioned myself quite a lot is that a lot of people really like to generalize a lot and make bad ""jokes"" about Jugos, Albaner, etc. And while it's not racism we of course also have the ever so popular hate/fear of Islam.

And SF only knows well done and outstanding irrespective of the facts! They can suck against weak teams and they tell you that it happens! But they celebrate every fucking move against a big team!

It is breathtaking in person  The Jet D'eau is cool cause it is in a sense the center of Geneva.

Switzerland,30ldpf,StuffedWithNails,3,Mon Mar 30 17:38:18 2015 UTC,"Now that I've read through most of the thread, not just the initial question... yeah, you really are setting yourself up for failure.  While I believe you're right that you are technically allowed to just come to Switzerland on your EU passport and look for a job, you need to be able to support yourself financially until you do have a job. 1000, even 1500 Swiss francs will vanish very, very fast, especially in an expensive place such as Zurich, faster than you can find a job.  And you need to save some for a return trip to your home country (not to be pessimistic, just realistic: what happens when you have no job and no money left? So you'll have to keep that amount aside for, say, a bus ride home.) And as an unskilled foreigner who does not speak any of the local languages, you would be very lucky to find a job.  You could also get mugged and lose all your money. Switzerland is pretty safe but these things happen.  The language thing is going to be double trouble in the German parts of Switzerland: the official language is German, it's the written language everywhere, and everybody can speak it, however on a daily basis the people of Switzerland actually speak a dialect of German called Swiss German. It's really a group of dialects, some of them are quite different from another, but they all fall under the same umbrella of Swiss German. It's German as its core but it sounds very different from what you'd learn in school if you took German classes.   So you'd have to know German, a.k.a. Hochdeutsch, which is the official language, to understand everything that's written in front of you (labels on supermarket items, street signs, government paperwork, newspapers, etc.) as well as know Swiss German in order to communicate effectively. Swiss German people can all speak ""standard"" German but they'll address you in Swiss German unless you request that they speak German with you.  In that regard you might actually have a somewhat easier time going to the French-speaking parts of the country instead of Zurich. You will still have to learn the local language, but you won't have to manage two at the same time. The western parts of Switzerland speak mostly standard French, with mild local accents, so if you just learned standard French by taking classes anywhere that teaches French, you'd be fine.  No matter where you go, though, you cannot get by with only English, you must have some basic knowledge of the local language(s).  Knowing a local language is an advantage but in no way is it a solution to all the problems you will have, especially with only 1000-1500 CHF, and they are not easy obstacles to overcome.  Your project is not entirely impossible, but very difficult and risky."

Switzerland,30ldpf,Lancezh,7,Sat Mar 28 15:34:12 2015 UTC,"Don't take this the wrong way, you sound like the typical person who did not do their homework well. You set yourself up for a perfect disaster. This is your life you're talking about and you're willing to travel to a foreign country already where you don't even have a remote clue on how they hire strangers and what jobs are needed, what languages are spoken, what the wages are ?  And you ask how long 1'000.-- last ? Wrong question. If you think you can just ""go"" and ""it'll work somehow"" then you're in for an ugly time. It's switzerland allright but money doesn't grow on tree here neither, also do yourself a favour and conduct proper research about this country, or any country you want to go to. To have a reason like ""it's wealthy"" sounds like a disaster to me. You're not here for an overnight trip, you want to go all in and get a job.  I hired plenty of people from serbia and other countries but only because swiss people didn't have the qualifications and we had to even prove that to the authorities (programmers with masters degrees), it's a long and ugly process most of the time and you still better be a hard worker.  Also if you want to work a low wage job you pretty much compete with everyone from eastern europe and other countries that are probably ready to do this kind of work for less and harder than you do. They all also came because they heard ""it's wealthy"". We have double as much foreigners than germany and all other surrounding countries in %. You compete directly with them, how far are you willing to go ? What are you willing to do ? What can you OFFER that noone else here has ? What standard of living are you willing to go for ? Because in Zurich (City) you better pull down your expectations when it comes to living for cheap money.  Other people have suggested it, try to get a job before you come here or don't come at all, it seems hard for you to save up 1'000.-- or let alone 1'500.-- and you may very well strand with that little amount here, much quicker than you think.  Starting new, cool. But make sure you're proper prepared for that trip."

This one in particular: http://www.englishforum.ch/forum.php  Read through it, see wether this is something for you, ask questions, people will help you there as they have similar experiences already made, make friends, build up connections.

If you want another spectacular view: go to the university hospital (Inselspital), and take the elevator to the floor S1. There's a cafeteria with a spectacular view (if the weather is somewhat ok). Walk through the old town, I really like the Münster and the Münsterterrasse, but actually the old town is pretty nice everywhere. You can also see the Rathaus and the Bundeshaus and the Bundesterrasse on foot.

According to Lucerne Tourism going inside the towers is only possible between 1st April - 1st Nov. Still worth visiting.   Other nice viewing points are Château Gütsch or close to the Lucerne Golf Club and of course Mount Pilatus but you can not go to the top of Mount Pilatus until 1st of April.  There are numerous nice Restaurants / Bars along the river and it's very photogenic. The lakeside aswell. Have a beer, take some pictures - that would be my plan I think."

Go have the best fucking Pizza ever, it's called Margherita doesn't have its own home page, but google will help you find it. It's quite expensive for ""just"" pizza, but everybody i brought to this place fell in love.  If you've never been to Basel you could just walk around a little in the old part of the town, lots of nice old buildings (Churches, etc), lots of history (e.g. Euler and the Mathematical Institute).  Other than that you'll find a plethora of museums in Basel. From cartoon over toys and famous paintings all the way to historical stuff.  Hope that helps :)"

But, there certainly aren't many cheaper/better options. IMO, the best way to enjoy a day in July without spending much money has got to be a Rhine barbecue. There is a grill at the Oetlingerstrasse Buvette which is free to use. OP just needs to bring their own meat and beer. They can spend the morning touring museums and the city and then in the afternoon go for a swim and relax at the Rhine. When I have visitors in the summer thats my usual plan. If the weather is bad then they'll have to stick to the museums."
Switzerland,308kub,YeaISeddit,3,Wed Mar 25 11:15:31 2015 UTC,"Well considering that i'm from south italy and had tons of original italian pizza i still rate this as one of the best ones out there.

Switzerland,308kub,YeaISeddit,2,Wed Mar 25 22:49:14 2015 UTC,"You have to swim on the Kleinbasel side. On a hot summer day it looks like this (http://i.imgur.com/xED5j2p.jpg). Everyone has swimming bags, which you can buy practically anywhere in Basel in the summer for 25 CHF. You walk upriver to maybe the Tinguely museum, put your stuff in the bag, and jump in. Then you float down to wherever you are meeting your friends. Maybe Oetlingerbuvette or Florabuvette. The Buvettes are little bars that sell food and drinks and they're set up every 100 meters or so and are good meeting points. Usually people hang out at the Rhine until a little after sunset drinking beer and eating barbecue. I really recommend it."
Switzerland,308kub,BrotmanLoL,1 point,Thu Mar 26 05:49:28 2015 UTC,If you want swimm in the rhine go down the rhine a bit into germany to the Isteiner Schwellen. Beautifull but still pretty unkown spott. You can get there by train from Basel.

Switzerland,305s3q,Starky_D,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:31:12 2015 UTC,"For me it's quite the opposite. I think it's not minimalistic enough. Currency Symbols are often quite simple, e.g. $ £ € ¥ and can easily be recognised, I like that. The diesign that cuerrently has the most votes is on one hand something I like because it's immediately recognisable as some currency and very simple, on the other hand I kind of dislike that it kind of is a copy of the idea of existing symbols such as the Bitcoin one.  Something I dislike also, because in my opinion it doesn't really add much, is that the whole thing is tilted."

Switzerland,303xfi,tango-01,4,Tue Mar 24 17:51:41 2015 UTC,"UPS, right? Well having worked in Logistics for over 10 years, this is much more common than you think.   Carriers try to optimize costs by consolidating cargo. They do the same with passengers, try booking a plane ticket and the direct route will almost always be the more expensive ones. Route your trip via 2 airports, fly a lot more, burn more fuel, and yet your ticket will be cheaper."
Switzerland,303xfi,DeCiB3l,3,Tue Mar 24 17:18:14 2015 UTC,Then how do you explain dead-leg trips? For example:  airBaltic Tallinn-Riga-Zurich May 20 = 68.99  airBaltic Riga-Zurich May 20 = 159.99
Switzerland,303xfi,tango-01,2,Tue Mar 24 17:24:46 2015 UTC,"For the same reason that everything is more expensive in Switzerland. Because people in Zurich have a higher purchasing power than those in Latvia. In other words, the airline charges more because they can.   There is also the law of supply and demand working here. The plane to Riga most likely has less empty seats available than the one coming to Zurich."
Switzerland,303xfi,DeCiB3l,2,Tue Mar 24 17:54:10 2015 UTC,"Look over my first post again.  But both flights go to Zurich. I guess people in Riga have more purchasing power than those in Tallinn. Both ticket go to Riga, so the seats on that flight remain the same."
Switzerland,303xfi,tango-01,2,Tue Mar 24 22:52:35 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry about that, I was in a hurry and on mobile. Well the answer is relatively simple, people pay more to be convenienced? And airlines want to attract flyers to less used routes to increase capacity?"

We thus have to ask ourselves, whether we want to fill the freed time with ""occupational therapy"" just to keep up the myth of full employment, or whether we trust in our human creativity to find and grasp new meaningful projects - on the basis of an unconditional basic income, to be voted on in Switzerland about 2016."

Switzerland,301lc8,Formagella,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:01:39 2015 UTC,"Well, some job demand shifts - but a good part of leaving workers won't be able to fill the new vacancies. And the amount of jobs in total should decrease (for quite some time until some solution is found) as it has done in all mayor surges of industrialisation - just look at the amount of people needed in agriculture now and 100 years ago. Or imagine what lorry drivers will do, once goods transportation is handed over to self driving vehicles. The coming social disruptions by unemployment should be heavier than the ones we know - as innovation speed in the information age is higher than in the industrialisation age.  And yes, you're right, not all lawyers etc. will be replaced by algorithms. In fact there are lots of tasks today undone, that can only be done by humans. But they are not yet sufficiently payed for - like development of secure free software, development of democracy, solving environmental and social problems.  I think today we have the means to start doing the really important work freely on the basis of an unconditional basic income.   For more advantages I recommend reading  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/wiki/index"
Switzerland,301lc8,oelsen,2,Tue Mar 24 16:50:52 2015 UTC,"The jobs didn't disappear, they were replaced by other jobs.   Farmers went to work in factories. There aren't more unemployed people now than 100 years ago despite of that.   Long range lorry drivers? They're a disappearing category in Switzerland, they're mostly eastern europeans now.  Yet you don't see armies of unemployed long range lorry drivers, youth simply don't learn that job anymore and the older guys retired."
Switzerland,301lc8,survivalnow,2,Tue Mar 24 18:46:41 2015 UTC,"OK - let's put it this way: The question whether in total more jobs will be removed than created by automation and rationalisation is an ongoing debate with almost equal amounts of experts against and in favor. However what I think is, that the temporary disruption until a new job is found and learned is sufficient to cause harm.   And the former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Harvard economics professor Lawrence Summers argues that this time will be different:   [T]here are many reasons to think the software revolution will be even more profound than the agricultural revolution. This time around, change will come faster and affect a much larger share of the economy. (Wall Street Journal, July 7, 2014)   Secondly, I think, we should not only leave it to the commercial market, which work is done and which not, because it mostly only reflects the personal demand of people and not the needs of the whole community and the ecosystem in which it lives. With a basic income - which we can now afford as we left scarcity economy behind - we can democratise the decision, which work should be done."

If you just want to make it a tax, fine, but then do this and don't outsource it to another bureaucracy machine. The solution I'd prefer most is for them to encrypt all the radio and television so that people can just pay by getting access cards from kiosk/post office/migros or whatever - this way only the people have to pay who actually want it.

Switzerland,2zss7k,markus_b,4,Mon Mar 23 07:29:01 2015 UTC,"I'd count 1 day for each pass. Starting in Wengen:   Wengen -> Gindelward via kleine Scheidegg Grindelwald -> Meiringen via grosse Scheidegg Meiringen -> Engelberg via Jochpass Engelberg -> Beckenried via Brisen Beckenried -> Rigi   These are doable in one day, but you must be in decent shape. The Jochpass (2200m) is the highest pass you must cross, depending on when exactly you go it will be without snow. I added the Brisen too, as it always very nice to climb a peak.  You and up every day in a place with public transport to bail out if necessary. You should be able to find a place to sleep in each place for a decent price (<100 chf), often they offer 'half-pension', where supper and breakfast are included in the price."

Be sure to click the links, they not only show you the hiking map but also give you more informations about the walk (length etc.)  Day 1: Wengen - Grindelwald. All day long you'll walk in front of Eiger, Mönch, Jungfrau.  Day 2: Grindelwald - Meiringen. Do the Grosse Scheidegg pass and visit the Reichenbach Falls where Sherlock Holmes died.  Day 3: You can walk from Meringen to Engelberg in one day, but it's pretty demanding - it's 31km. Of course you could take a cable car. Alternatively just go up to Melchsee-Frutt.  Day 4: Melchsee Frutt - Engelberg. This is a popular walk as you pass different nice lakes.   Day 5: Engelberg - Niederrickenbach. The first part is another popular walk (""Walenpfad"") but go fruther until Niederrickenbach which basically is a convent, a couple of farm houses and a hotel. After 9 o'clock you won't here a noise.  Day 6: Niederrickenbach - Rütli. Get ready for some Swiss history: The destination is the place where Switzerland was ""founded"" in 1291. Just be aware: there are no hotels there so make sure you the the last boat (yeah, there is no train or bus station)  Day 7: Gersau - Rigi. Pass the Lake by train and start going up to Mt. Rigi from Gersau (alternatively Vitznau or Weggis, it doesn't really matter).  I don't know about your physical condition. This route is pretty demanding but doable. Also: If you get tired on some of those walks you can take a cable car. But it is totally worth it, these are some of Switzerland's most popular walks. Just be aware: Due to snow and weather conditions, it's probably best to wait till June to start hiking."

Switzerland,2zqn98,SwissBliss,1 point,Fri Mar 20 20:55:43 2015 UTC,"I'll leave my answer for a similar question a while ago:  Anywhere between Geneva and Lausanne is stunning http://www.lavaux-unesco.ch/data/dataimages/upload/ambianceHome6.jpg   But if you want to go to an ""off the beaten path"" area, then I HIGHLY recommend camping/hiking around La Dole in Vaud. http://goo.gl/5UJH92 This is on the Jura mountains. When you get to this small chalet/restaurant it is completely surrounded by wilderness (forests, creeks and such, and a great view of Lake Geneva), and you can climb to that ball on the mountain in about 40 minutes, and 20 minutes back down. I've camped there many times and it's beautiful especially when you walk through those cow fields and through the forest. Find a clearing and pitch a tent. Just be aware of boars. I've never seen one but you'll definitely see the tracks they leave Edit:St Cergue is beautiful too. St Cergue is amazing so you could just stay in that region and go in the plentiful forest. If you do go there, go to Rando Burger, best Burger in Switzerland imo. Also while you hike you'll probably randomly encounter a refuge to eat and drink so that's nice. Really the whole Jura mountain is beautiful because it's not high enough to be full of snow all year, instead you just have nature at its finest. If you have any question about the French speaking part of Switzerland just ask :)  Another quick little spot that I found maybe 7 years ago: http://imgur.com/a/FFtcs#0  I made the directions from the closest town. It's on the way up to La Dole as mentioned above. Basically it's a nice little lake/pond in the woods, and if you go up through the woods from there by foot, and follow the river up you'll get to a place I like to call ""paradise"". Basically it's a sloped ""river"" (very shallow, like 3cm deep) down the mountain with tons of moss growing in the stream, and I usually walk up it bare foot which is really cold, but nice."

I'm now living on the west coast of the States.   So far I've had nothing but pleasant experiences with the consulate in SF. I did manage to lose some paperwork in the mail, but I'm chalking that up (embarrassingly) to it being the first time I'd sent mail in several years. In person, it's quite fast, convenient almost (if you consider traveling 1000 miles convenient).   I'm actually heading back down again in a week to go through the passport paperwork. All you need is an American passport, swiss citizenship, and ~$150!  This is an incredible opportunity we've been afforded. Being a Swiss means not only the right to work in Switzerland but an easy way to get a job in other European countries as well.   Some information I wish someone had told me: 1) taxes. Like almost every country but the US, there's no tax on foreign earned income. Job in the US? Suisse don't care! 2) passports. Easy to look up, but nice to know -- 10 years, valid to tons of places, good identity/work document in pretty much all of Europe. $140 I believe? You do an appointment with your local consulate, where they do biometric data gathering. As far as I know this means photo and fingerprint. Can't do this remotely. After that, they ship it from Switzerland in a few weeks.  Out of curiosity, do you have any plans for your new citizenship? Parlez-vous français ? Sprechen Sie Deutsch?   Edit: you're back in the states, right? Thinking of moving back?"

I've been to a few places of the west part (Vallée de Joux VD, Val de Travers NE, St-Imier BE, Saignelégier JU) and each time it had something different.

I mean, they call it the heart of Switzerland, it's where it all began. You know, Wilhelm Tell and stuff. (Of course, much of it is more folklore than history, but still.)  On the other hand I always say: If I had to write a list with the most beautiful things in Switzerland, I would completly forget about the ""Drei-Seen-Land""/""Pays des Trois-Lacs"" (the region of Neuchatel, Biel-Bienne, Yverdon...). But whenever I am there, its beauty completly stuns me. It is not the typical alpine region that comes to your mind if you think about Switzerland. There are mountains (and the Creux du Vant is beautiful and a great hike), but there are also the lakes, beautiful villages and vinaries.

The Therme is a masterpiece of architecture and it was operated similarly, gorgeously. The experience of spending four or five days there was something not to be missed in one's lifetime: From the experience of the baths themselves, the limited numbers, additional swimming at night as a guest; the food and atmosphere; The operation and treatment by the staff, etc., etc.. Not too many people, to an outsider at least, with some deference to the local village and surroundings,all in all my favorite place in the world, probably with no exaggeration.  Adding a tower of this size would not only spoil the beauty of the valley and surrounding Village, but would unnecessarily bring far, far too many people to this area.I am all for tourism, obviously I was a tourist, but tours and does not have to equate to greed. I think One of the things Switzerland   does so well is offer a great  balance of experience for the cost, with easy  access, fine people, etc.it does not need to be ""used"" for every last penny from tourists.  In fact for that very reason I tell very few people about Vals as I would hate to see it become overrun like some other destinations.frankly when we heard the hotel and bath was being sold we were worried; when we saw the new website and the ridiculous changes and jump in pricing/reduction in services we were deeply saddened and probably resigned to not visiting the game anytime soon.this is why I already havedeep misgivings about the owner who seems far more interested in money than anything of substance.  And finally, as an architect, that tower is brutal, at least go to one of your great Swiss architects say Herzog and du Muron (sp?), or dare I say Zumthor  [who would probably refuse and I hope is protesting this]!"

But Switzerland has a lot of valleys, dreamy villages, untouched nature etc. I don't think one tower would spoil it all. Some fresh approach and experimentation wouldn't harm once in a while in my opinion. By the way, the tower-concept pictured on that news website is only one of the plans that were already declined. So it would definitely not look like that.  One modern contrast building which would even be Europe's tallest would of course bring controversy and quite some international spotlight to Vals. Whether that's exclusively a good thing, I don't know. But worth a try."

Switzerland,2zdjxc,nuephelkystikon,5,Tue Mar 17 18:16:59 2015 UTC,"I did that.  It's actually a matter of changing the municipiality of origin - the canton of origin follows from this. The conditions for a municipiality to accept you into this status varies, but usually involves having lived there for some time. It usually also requires a moderate fee (CHF 250 for Zurich city).  Check the local bureau de l'état civil / Zivilstandsamt / ufficio dello stato civile of the targeted municipiality."
Switzerland,2zdjxc,SatoyS,3,Tue Mar 17 22:21:09 2015 UTC,"As far as I know it is possible, but does it really matter? I guess it costs a few 100 Francs (including new identity card,...) to do it and it doesn't really change anything?!"
Switzerland,2zdjxc,hubraum,2,Tue Mar 17 18:28:18 2015 UTC,"As I said, it doesn't change much; I was just curious about the procedure. I've had little luck finding any resources online. Can you tell me where you got the 100 CHF figure?"
Switzerland,2zdjxc,SatoyS,3,Tue Mar 17 18:36:37 2015 UTC,"You're referring to the Heimatort / Lieu d'origine, right?  AFAIK you can ask the county you'd want to have listed as origin if they want to accept you (usually no big deal). It's just some paperwork and as SatoyS says new ID, Passport etc. - my guess would be a little over 100 but not much.

Switzerland,2zdjxc,sbetschi12,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:44:05 2015 UTC,I should have written a couple of 100 francs. You will need a new ID card and all the bureaucracy will also cost. But it is a pure guess...
Switzerland,2zdjxc,SwissBliss,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:04:42 2015 UTC,I think it s only possible trough marriage or trough staying in a place for 10+ years (up to the new Heimatort) and going trough with a bit of bureacracy.
Switzerland,2zdjxc,futurespice,7,Tue Mar 17 18:59:14 2015 UTC,"I hope you don't mind my comment as I'm really just trying to help, but I noticed that you spelled through as trough three times.  I just wanted to point out that through begins with T-H.  A trough is something out of which animals eat or drink.    I know English spellings can really suck and be totally counter-intuitive sometimes.  Then again, French spelling and pronunciation is insane, German grammar is difficult, and Italian makes everyone sound either angry or romantic, so I guess all our languages have their faults."
Switzerland,2zdjxc,SwissBliss,1 point,Wed Mar 18 09:17:45 2015 UTC,"I have a question about the Lieu d'origine.  I was told by my dad that the place that is written there is the place you go to if you become homeless/last resort, and they will partly take care of you? This is very likely wrong, but that's kind of what he told me. If so, I think it's worth it to set it as a place you know and like. I don't think it should be passed down from parents, but instead be the first place of residence maybe?"

My Lieu D'origine says insert village name, Lucerne, which is of course passed down from my dad, who has like me never been there lol.   I definitely want to change mine to my village here in Vaud since I feel far more connection to Romandie than the swiss german side.   I've actually always wondered how to determine where I come from in Switzerland. Is it the canton you're born in, the place you grew up in, the place with most family, the place where your parents are from. Personally I feel like a Vaudois or Valaisan since those are the places I was born and raised in, and a lot of my family is from. I feel almost no connection to the german speaking side to be honest even though a lot of my family is from there, and I have a hard time when I go there since their mentality is so different. I could not imagine living there, I value too much the openness, internationality, and relaxed attitude that living between Geneva and Lausanne brings. It's actually funny, my mom who grew up swiss german and swiss french (Bern/Vaud/Valais region), and who ""escaped"" the swiss german side can actually not stand hearing SRF and such, and always complains about having to visit my dad's family cause they're so... I don't know... Swiss german lol (from Zurich/Aargau). I wonder if swiss germans here feel the same way about us?"
Switzerland,2zdjxc,Urgullibl,2,Tue Mar 17 23:31:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some of them do think we're different. Mostly they think we're delinquent. My Heimatort is St. Gallen, and I think I've been there once. Haha. But now I'd really like to change it to Vaud too!   I've actually always wondered how to determine where I come from in Switzerland.   Me personally, it's where I grew up. Especially since I'm not living there atm (studying) so I'm going to have to change my registration to Zurich once I'm finished studying (soon) so maybe changing my Heimatort would be a nice thing to do..."

Switzerland,2z4ffk,lhatchy1,7,Sun Mar 15 13:55:33 2015 UTC,"It is most certainly possible to organise, but will require some preparations.   I'm a leader in the scouts and we are going on a hike regularly and camp between 1-2 nights at different locations (with or without tents).   What do you need to do? Well plan your route and make some calculations as to how long it is going to take you to walk from point to point. You can find the maps here. You can find a march time calculator here. [XLS downloadlink German]  As for the camping this is usually the trickier part because you need the consent of the owners of the parcel you would like to camp on. This means that you need to actually go to the places you would like to stay at and ask at the next farm, who owns this particular piece of land.  They usually know who owns what if they do not own it themselves. If the parcel belongs to the village I suggest looking elsewhere because it is usually a pain in the ass to deal with administrations. Although Freedom to Roam exists on the national level, nowadays it is common to make camping require special permission.   If the you have located the landowners you ask them if you could stay on their land for a night and then move on in the morning. Most people will be open for the idea, some will turn you down however due to bad past experiences.   This is usually free of charge as long as you promise TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELVES.  If you do not clean up they will refuse to give it out to future campers which is particularity annoying for scouts and similar organisations.   Just a few weeks ago we were turned away for a very nice camping site because some assholes could not clean up after themselves.  Cleaning up after yourselves of course means that you do not leave a single shred of litter behind you, which should be common courtesy.   One problem I see with your idea is with the drinking and party part. In Switzerland we have night time from 10 after which neighbours can send the police to shut you up if you make a lot of noise. So if you want to party loud you will need the consent of all neighbours. I doubt that you will find a place in Switzerland where this is not a problem outside the Alps."

Switzerland,2z4ffk,SoulLink,1 point,Sun Mar 15 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"In summer you can just take your bedroll and a waterproof cover to sleep outside. You are just going to be a bit wet and probably have a sunburn in the morning if you sleep in.  During spring/fall some tent is of course advisable. Even if it is just a ""Blache""-tent  Also make sure to have a emergency shelter available. Just ask the farmer in proximity if you could sleep in their barn should there be a storm."

Switzerland,2z4c2l,elisabeth4,2,Sun Mar 15 13:13:17 2015 UTC,Do it on my bike every year. It is the highest point in Switzerland reached by public transport. So you just put your bike on the bus and get off at the top - then offer you go to Sierre for fondue and wine (with minimal peddling).
Switzerland,2z4c2l,giles28,2,Sun Mar 15 15:23:10 2015 UTC,It is the highest point in Switzerland reached by public transport.   Nufenen pass is 42 m higher and has a Postauto course.

Switzerland,2z493f,happl,2,Sun Mar 15 13:30:28 2015 UTC,there are no night trains. take a train from Venezia to Milano where you change to a train to Basel and in Spiez to another train to Interlaken Ost. you have to buy the train tickets in advance and reserve seats. SBB has a good electronic timetable http://www.sbb.ch/en/timetable.html   two days is not very long so i recommend to stay in Interlaken and make a visit to Jungfraujoch or Schilthorn.
Switzerland,2z493f,brmagic,1 point,Sun Mar 15 18:49:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry for my missunderstanding.  There are, as far as I know, no overnight Trains.   You could look for a Train that arrives early in the morning in Zermatt, so you can see the sunrise and then you could do some hiking during the day before traveling to Interlaken in the afternoon.   The next day you could go to Luzern, there are a lot of possibilitys for shopping and also sightseeing.  Edit: As I saw right now, the earliest train would arrive ca. 12:00. If you go directly to Interlaken for the first day and doing sightseeing usw. in Interlaken, you could go to Zermatt on your second day, it's a 2 hour train ride to Zermatt and your earliest arrival there would be 08:13 AM."

Switzerland,2z493f,futurespice,1 point,Sun Mar 15 13:17:11 2015 UTC,"I second Luzern. Great for walking.  We also took a bus to Kriens and got the cable cars up to Mt. Pilatus.  Then the incline down the other side to the train at Alpnachstad just S of Luzern.  A train pass is not too expensive for US residents and a great way to get around with discounts on lots of museums and half price for private rails and cable cars.  It's more expensive but the trip up to Jungfraujoch is a once in a lifetime treat (although I've done it twice!)  Research carefully. You can take the train up one way and down the other.   Take the hour ride north the Shaffhausen and walk the preserved vilage, wall, and take a taxi to the falls.  The scenic trains are a real treat - Goldenpass and Glacier Express. Many regio trains are amazingly scenic."

Switzerland,2z0fsz,RagingOrangutan,26,Sat Mar 14 11:58:45 2015 UTC,"This isnt the US, cops here are not your enemy and often helpful and even have - gasp! - a common sense.  They might stop you and you have to provide identification, but you wont end up in jail for minor crimes nor will you be tasered or shot at a traffic stop.  In short, don't worry, they are actually people!"
Switzerland,2z0fsz,weirdbreh,17,Sat Mar 14 13:42:01 2015 UTC,"It's not a legal reference or anything, but reading travel wikis can be very telling about the local police:   Swiss police take on a relatively unobtrusive air; they prefer to remain behind the scenes, as they consider their presence potentially threatening to the overall environment (practice of de-escalation). Unlike some more highly policed countries, officers will rarely approach civilians to ask if they need help or merely mark their presence by patrolling. However, police are indeed serious about traffic violations. Jaywalking (crossing a red pedestrian light), for example, will be fined on the spot.  Football (soccer) games are the only notable exception to the above rule. Due to the potential threat of hooligan violence, these games (especially in Basel or Zurich) are generally followed by a large contingent of police officers with riot gear, rubber bullets, and tear gas, in case of any major unrest.   There have been problems with police assuming that any Black, East European, or Arab person without an ID card or passport is an illegal immigrant, and treating them accordingly.    Other interesting tidbits:   Switzerland has very strong Good Samaritan laws, making it a civic duty to help a fellow in need (without unduly endangering oneself). People are therefore very willing and ready to help you if you appear to be in an emergency situation. Be aware, though, that the same applies to you if you witness anyone in danger. The refusal to render help to a person in need can be punishable by law as ""Verweigerung der Hilfeleistung"", ie refusal of aid. The general reservation of Americans to avoid entanglement with strangers due to possible future civil liability does not apply in Switzerland, for it would be practically impossible to wage a civil suit against anyone providing aid.    and   The drinking age for beer, wine and alcoholic cider is 16 (but not in all cantons, so make sure to ask before buying) while the age for any other alcohol (eg spirits, ""alcopops"", etc) is 18. The public consumption of alcohol in Switzerland is legal, so do not be alarmed if you see a group of teenagers drinking a six-pack on public property; this is by no means out of the ordinary and should not be interpreted as threatening.    and    Switzerland is not a country of insane civil lawsuits and damage claims; consequently, if you see a sign or disclaimer telling you not to do something, obey it! An example: in many alpine areas, charming little mountain streams may be flanked by signs with the message ""No Swimming"". To the uninitiated, this may seem a bit over the top, but these signs are in fact a consequence of the presence of hydroelectric power plants further upstream that may discharge large amounts of water without warning."

Switzerland,2z0fsz,enenra,6,Sat Mar 14 18:55:13 2015 UTC,Eh. I strongly doubt that unless you do it blatantly in front of Police you're ever going to have a problem with it. Or of course if you get hit by a car. But that should be obvious. :P
Switzerland,2z0fsz,BoneHead777,2,Sat Mar 14 19:54:17 2015 UTC,Common sense applies. Jaywalking an empty street is okay. Jaywalking a street with heavy traffic is idiotic and is going to get someone killed.

Switzerland,2z0fsz,omega6244,29,Sat Mar 14 14:10:39 2015 UTC,"All you have to tell them is your name, your adress, your job (NOT your employer), your date of birth, where you're from and the name of your parents.  Other than that you can refuse to answer (""Ich verweigere die Aussage""). I recommend always refusing to answer, except in obvious situations where it may be better to talk. It's pretty much the same as in every other country: If you're not a jurist you will not gain anything by answering their questions - you can only lose.  ""Verdachtsunabhängige Kontrollen"" - a control without suspicion (I tink the legal american equivalent of the necessary suspicion would probably be closest to probable cause) are not allowed. But let's be real, they exist and you can't really do anything about it (you can ""intimidate"" the cop by threatening him with a Dienstaufsichtsbeschwerde (a formal complaint) etc. but it probably won't be much use).  More information: http://www.augenauf.ch/bs/archiv/wef03/deine_rechte.pdf (I highly recommend reading that to everyone. Your rights are important and it is important that you make use of them.)"

Switzerland,2z0fsz,shapul,15,Sat Mar 14 18:12:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed. There is no reason to be worried about the police. They are quite helpful and very polite. Sometimes they go out of their way to help you. For example once a police officer helped me in a clod night when the battery in my car was dead. He told me to stay, went back to the station about one kilometer away to bring his personal car in which  he had the cables to jump start my car. Add to this that I am a brown guy who at the time didn't speak any French."
Switzerland,2z0fsz,pagkatapos,5,Sat Mar 14 12:02:32 2015 UTC,"And even if they're not helpful be polite to them. They're people and their job can be stressful, and frankly all they're doing is implementing the law. If they're assholes it's not going to help anyone by being an asshole back. Stay polite, but be wary. If they're just having a rough day they'll warm up to you soon enough. As a bicyclist I am intent on breaking the law by driving on the pedestrian lane (when there's enough space and I am not hindering any pedestrians obv) whenever I have doubts about my safety. I've only had 3 run ins with the police in my 7 years of cycling (and breaking laws) in Zurich, and have managed to eschew 2 fines by being willing to pay on the spot but arguing about my safety. They're not out to get you, but they also want you to abide by the law. Be willing to show that you're a rational person that is not out to prove them wrong.  p.s. also police is a cantonal thing. Police in GE? I'd resign myself to whatever immediately. They do not fuck around. Maybe other people have had better experiences with police in Geneva but mine have been miserable."

While the situation may be better than, say in the US or India, there are problems with police in Switzerland and it is not healthy for the political discourse to say otherwise. Especially since mainly minoritys are targeted, which noone really cares about (demonstrators, young people, refugees).

AFAIK not legal without a reason (suspicion you have or are going to commit a crime ) - although it's easy to make one up, still not right.  You're also not required to carry ID (same as in US), but if they have a reason (probable cause) they can take you with them to identify you. So it's easier to have ID on you.  I wouldn't worry too much about it unless you're hanging out with some people who constantly have run ins with the law. ch/swiss trees people could tell you more about things here, I suppose, I only know it's pretty relaxed, they're not out looking for you, but they will cross the road if they see you smoking stuff. Just don't be stupid.  You have similar rights as in the US, you're not required to respond to any accusations, you have the right to see a judge should you be jailed (24h, 48h on weekends). You also have the right to get a reason why you are arrested in a language you are able to understand. Police are required to tell you your rights (= miranda rights)."
Switzerland,2z0fsz,hubraum,4,Sat Mar 14 19:01:02 2015 UTC,You're also not required to carry ID   I thought as a foreigner you are required to carry your Ausländerausweis at all times. I was told this by a group of police officers when I didn't have mine on me.
Switzerland,2z0fsz,hubraum,1 point,Sat Mar 14 12:21:50 2015 UTC,"Depends on where/why you were stopped (train, car) but no, in general, you are definitely not required to have ID on you.

Switzerland,2z0fsz,DeepBlueNemesis,3,Sat Mar 14 18:31:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, I wasn't doing anything suspect when I got stopped either. It was near Zurich HB close to midnight and I was walking home from work - dressed normally (jacket and well kept jeans), the only thing I can think of is that I'm obviously an expat (brown skin.) Oh, and I had my climbing rope bag with me which maaaybe could've looked like a sleeping bag (maybe he thought I was a transient.)  When I got my Ausländerausweis the man at the Kreisburo did tell me that I needed to have it with me at all times, though."
Switzerland,2z0fsz,pagkatapos,4,Sat Mar 14 18:40:38 2015 UTC,"Well he's not wrong in a sense that it saves you some trouble, but in a legal sense, you're not required - doesn't matter if you're a Swiss citizen or not (for now the same laws apply to all here, but we'll see what SVP comes up with next).  I know a few police officers working in Zurich, they have a HUGE problem with drug dealers from Africa, so no doubt there is some kind of racial profiling going on. I don't support that of course, but hearing their side of the story is not pretty either, so I get where they're coming from."

I definitely don't look African (though I do look kinda Arab - I'm actually half Indian/half Swiss-German-Austrian mutt) nor do I think I look like a drug dealer - I figured he was trying to enforce immigration policy, but who knows. As soon as I showed him my 'L' permit he asked ""oh, you work in Switzerland?"" and I said ""yes"" and he let me go on my way."
Switzerland,2z0fsz,LaoBa,5,Sat Mar 14 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"The thing is that drug dealers don't look like drug dealers. All you know is that they are in certain locations (like around the railway station), most of them are north africans or arabs and sometimes they have strange luggage, like a rope bag that looks like a sleeping bag.  You fit the profile and you were asked to ID yourself, which you did. It turned out their suspicion was wrong so they let you go. It's an interaction that happes several times per shift for an officer and as long as they were polite it's a perfectly fine and normal thing to do."

Not really no, they are cops, they are supposed to find out the truth, even if they have to lie to do so.

Does he have the right to deny access to his vehicle or home, etc... In the USA it is advisable to avoid anything that could potentially be self incriminating. It's not a bad idea to know what your rights are when you are living abroad. Look at Amanda Knox. She's likely innocent, but has been found guilty of murder just because she didn't handle her interactions with the police well."

Switzerland,2z10l5,billag,10,Sat Mar 14 15:54:51 2015 UTC,Billag tax is payed per household.   If anyone in the household has the means to watch TV or listen radio you've got to pay the tax whether or not you actually use any of them.
Switzerland,2z10l5,Skinnj,2,Sat Mar 14 16:25:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answer.   Billag tax is payed per household.   Yes, I understand. But then the letter should have been for my friend, not me, right? As I mentioned, since (Nov, 2013 to present) in our apartment we have internet + cable + TV + apartment contract under my friend's name.   Do you know if it is mandatory to inform Billag about the change of address, or is it enough to just update the address at the cantonal office?  Also, I didn't understand what amount is payable as per the letter. Is it 169 + 35 or 169 + 35 + 33 + 5?"

Switzerland,2z10l5,Urgullibl,1 point,Sun Mar 15 11:10:14 2015 UTC,"I disagree. We're not only talking about entertainment, but also information. But anyway, Redxl1 said ""these days"", so I don't think that's what he meant."
Switzerland,2z10l5,Severian427,0,Sun Mar 15 11:25:19 2015 UTC,"We're talking about entertainment, which is well over 90% of state-run TV and radio. If there is a need for the government to feed us information (is there?), they can always rent airtime."
Switzerland,2z10l5,Urgullibl,1 point,Sun Mar 15 11:29:40 2015 UTC,"No, we're not talking about ""entertainment"", we're talking about a public service, which is much more than just the diffusion of entertainment, whether you see it or not. There's entertainment, yes, but also information and education, as well as the diffusion of historical content, and the preservation of content for the future (archiving and such). And I'm actually glad to pay to have a rather good quality public service which is not money-driven, largely free of advertisements (on the radio anyway) and relatively independent of marketing and political pressures."
Switzerland,2z10l5,Severian427,0,Sun Mar 15 13:09:41 2015 UTC,"State TV and radio are well over 90% diffusion of entertainment, and there is no reason the taxpayer should pay for it.

The comparison with US networks is clearly not applicable due to the huge difference in market size. And I don't know the topic well, but a quick Wikipedia search tells me that both those networks are at least partly publicly funded, and both are non-profit. :) BBC or NHK are other examples of high-quality public services that we should try to emulate."

Switzerland,2z10l5,markus_b,3,Sat Mar 14 19:59:24 2015 UTC,"You have two options:   One: You accept that you have to pay and you pay the amount withing 10 days. Two: You oppose the underlying bill as incorrect. You will have to do this with the 'Office des Poursuites' also within 10 days.   If you don't do 'Two' within 10 days then the 'Office des Poursuites' will presume that you accept the depth and will impound that amount, probably from your salary.  As a first step call Billag to get a copy of the original bill. You should also discuss with them the details about you having dissolved the household by Oct 2013. I would not even mention the details of what happened later, you just moved in with a friend.   If the bill is from October or earlier, 'One' applies. It may be that Billag allows you to pay the original bill, waiving the fees, then you pay them immediately. Otherwise you call the Office des Poursuites and ask them about the total mount (there is daily interest) and pay/wire that amount to them.  If the bill is from November onwards, 'Two' applies. But Billag should consent to withdraw it anyway, because the Apartment is not in your name. Did your friend and apartment-renter pay the Billag bills ?"

I feel obligated to post this: sauce  > not parking the car straight enough etc (usual Swiss things)  I have an acronym for situations like this - Mother Fucking Swiss. I love/hate these people.   You park a bit crooked, but still inside the lines, and the neighbors call the police? MFS  You're training for a triathalon, cycling top speed, and get passed by a man in a suit on a mountain bike? MFS  A (rare) homeless man hits you up for change, and it turns out that he speaks 5 languages? MFS  You're meeting friends in a strange town and your phone dies, so you ask in bars and hotels whether you can use theirs, and every single person looks at you like an alien; they can't even comprehend the level of disorganization that would result in an unexpectedly dead phone, and all refuse you help, thinking it must be some kind of trick? MFS  You're applying for an apartment with a garden, and ask if you can plant in it too. You know, some tomatoes, a pumpkin, whatever. The Corbusier-looking mother fucker sucks his teeth and then finally says ""perhaps... if you can prove geometrically that these plants would be elegant additions to the overall theme of the space."" MMMFFFFSSSS  Climbing a terrifying ridge and get passed by a heavily pregnant woman, annoyed at your slowness. MFS  Use the bones from your chicken to make stock and get greeted with confused scorn. What is this guy, poor? MFS  Edit: I've been collecting these.   Referred to, depending on the language, as either a foreigner or a stranger. Ask to be called an immigrant, which carries far less stigma. Whoa, PC police! Fucking foreigners tell us how to speak? Forget it. MFS  Hear about a bar, which used to be cool, but is now ""filled with students and foreigners"". OH, you mean people like me? MFS  Fire needs to be lit / shed needs to be built / any physical task needs to be done properly? ""Ask the Canadian"". MFS  The bar closes at 12:00. At 11:55 the bartender announces last call, at 11:59:59 the last patron leaves the door, and at 12:00:01 the police appear. MFS  You hike up to a high alpine cabin. The other (swiss) climbers, in perfect unison, and without talking about it, sit down to eat, consume their bread, soup, and cheese in the same order, start their ovomaltine together, finish at the same time, go in shifts to brush their teeth, and, in total synchronicity hit the sack at precisely 10:00. The next day, without alarms, every person steps out of bed at 6:00, eats breakfast, and is gone by 7:00. You hang out until noon to soak up the incredible scenery and the sole staff member subtly mocks your hiking plans with his eyebrow and tone. ""Ze col de la Forcla in zose boots!?"" <utterly scandalized expression> MFS   You: We should get moving if we're going to catch that train. MFS: What? Why? The train leaves in 13 minutes and it's only a 7 minute walk, or 9.5 if you stop to buy cigarettes.   Hey, can I talk to you about a trip to Canada in January? You: Ok, it's a bit early for flights and stuff but it pays to think in advance I suppose... wait.... January of what year? MFS: 2015.   Swiss boss: Let's meet at the hotel in Munich (300 km away) at 8:25 pm. And we did.   You buy some ""lard"" (smoked bacon, meant to be eaten uncooked) at the farmer's market. It's good raw, but you want to try it fried. Your co-worker smells it from his office, suspects what you're up to, and bursts into the kitchen yelling ""You cannot DO zis!"" MFS  The used bike is 485 francs. I offer 400. Long stare. ""My price, I think, reflects the actual quality of the frame, components, and labor."" MFS  I'm from Canada, have you been? ""Oh, on a small trip, I spent one month by bicycle in Quebec, and then bought a motorhome and drove to vancouver - what a long drive! I loved the open prairies - and then sold the motorhome and spent the next weeks skiing. Whistler was nice but I prefer Chamonix for the après ski culture. Tell me, is the climbing in Squamish as good as they say? And how do you compare Big White with Whistler? And do you prefer New York, Montreal, or San Francisco? I found things to love about each place."" I... I, uh, I've never been to any of those places. MFS  People on the train begin to grumble and get exasperated. I look at my watch: we're 3 minutes late.

Switzerland,2ywk5h,Urgullibl,23,Fri Mar 13 23:46:58 2015 UTC,"you were slightly misdirected. it is indeed illegal to involve into a premarital sex while watering your plants (in public places). as well as if the one of the premarital sex doers are under 16, then it makes it even more illegal. generally, watering plants is not a big issue (just be careful with public displays of it), but if you're going to work in banking, then watering your plants at work while sniffing cocaine is considered at least rude. your colleagues will definitely not appreciate occasional water in their sniff."
Switzerland,2ywk5h,hopsafoobar,6,Fri Mar 13 13:13:54 2015 UTC,it is actually legal to have premarital sex with people under  the age of 16 if the age difference is smaller than 3 years
Switzerland,2ywk5h,pagkatapos,16,Fri Mar 13 16:31:32 2015 UTC,Still not while watering flowers in public places.
Switzerland,2ywk5h,batwingsuit,-1,Fri Mar 13 17:00:40 2015 UTC,"AND if one of the two individuals is at least 16. Therefore the youngest legal age at which you can have sex is 13, with a 16 year-old."
Switzerland,2ywk5h,pagkatapos,1 point,Fri Mar 13 22:23:00 2015 UTC,so if two 15 year old sleep with each other they will get arrestet?!
Switzerland,2ywk5h,DantesDame,6,Fri Mar 13 23:12:47 2015 UTC,Only if they have been watering plants.
Switzerland,2ywk5h,t0t0zenerd,0,Sat Mar 14 06:50:48 2015 UTC,"It would be illegal at the very least, yes. An arrest, however, is far from guaranteed."
Switzerland,2ywk5h,pagkatapos,1 point,Sat Mar 14 08:47:48 2015 UTC,"Er, no: Art 187.2 of the Penal Code: The youngest legal age of the person the 16yo can have sex with is 13. The youngest legal age of the 13yo's partner would be 10, and so on. There is no defined lower limit."
Switzerland,2ywk5h,canteloupy,1 point,Sat Mar 14 09:37:17 2015 UTC,"But according to what I read about the new law written after the initiative against pedophiles got accepted, it's now illegal for anyone above 18 to have sex with anybody younger, regardless of the age difference, right?"
Switzerland,2ywk5h,t0t0zenerd,1 point,Sat Mar 14 12:10:42 2015 UTC,"No, that just excludes people who were convicted of sexual crimes involving minors from working with minors. Having consensual sex with a 16-year-old is not a crime, hence the law does not apply."
Switzerland,2ywk5h,SwissBliss,9,Sat Mar 14 12:21:00 2015 UTC,You've been had.
Switzerland,2ywk5h,dereddib,10,Fri Mar 13 12:49:35 2015 UTC,"Strange laws include not being able to hang your towels out of the balcony (in some cantons) or not being allowed to wash your car in a non-designated wash spot (because of the detergents). That's all the weird things I can think of.   Oh, and you're not supposed to recycle your glass on Sundays but I still do it (just not in the morning then)."
Switzerland,2ywk5h,Kazumara,10,Fri Mar 13 13:04:08 2015 UTC,"not being allowed to wash your car in a non-designated wash spot (because of the detergents)   I don't think that one is strange at all. In general, the Swiss are very environmentally conscious, and I applaud them for it."
Switzerland,2ywk5h,LaoBa,4,Fri Mar 13 13:17:22 2015 UTC,"No, it's not weird in that sense, I just didn't know it was a thing (so I mentioned it just in case). It does make complete sense."

Switzerland,2ywk5h,Urgullibl,4,Fri Mar 13 16:26:32 2015 UTC,Also you can't mow your lawn or drill holes in your walls on Sunday.
Switzerland,2ywk5h,idlestabilizer,4,Fri Mar 13 13:10:47 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, anything that's loud basically! Sunday is rest day and people try to rest. So either go out for a walk/hike/sporting event to blow off steam or stay at home and enjoy a quiet cuppa.  But honestly, I still do loud things on Sunday, just not in the morning. At around 13.00 to 15.00 is a universal time where nearly everyone's awake."
Switzerland,2ywk5h,RagingOrangutan,3,Fri Mar 13 13:15:47 2015 UTC,Also no loud thing after 10PM and no very loud thing after 7PM.
Switzerland,2ywk5h,C4p5ul3,2,Fri Mar 13 15:34:52 2015 UTC,That one really depends on the neighbourhood you're in. In a tower block in Vennes people won't be too sticky but in a villa in Belmont you can count on the cops being at your door at 22.01 if you're having a party.
Switzerland,2ywk5h,RagingOrangutan,10,Fri Mar 13 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"Rule of Thumb: Switzerland is just like any other developed nation  The only thing is not mowing your lawn on a Sunday, which I think is a good rule cause people want to relax without too much noise."

Switzerland,2ywk5h,idlestabilizer,8,Sat Mar 14 09:43:08 2015 UTC,One thing that surprised me is that many apartment buildings have rules on when you can do laundry. It's very common for laundry to not be allowed on Sunday and at night.
Switzerland,2ywk5h,SwissBliss,1 point,Sat Mar 14 13:05:51 2015 UTC,"Yep, in my building you can do your laundry from 08:00 to 21:00. At around 21:00, the machines in the laundry are turned off and nobody can use them the weekend."
Switzerland,2ywk5h,batwingsuit,4,Fri Mar 13 13:04:26 2015 UTC,Whoa the whole weekend?! Even Saturday you can't do laundry?
Switzerland,2ywk5h,goldenvile,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:13:37 2015 UTC,I think so yes.

Switzerland,2ywk5h,mo1to1,2,Fri Mar 13 19:34:47 2015 UTC,Yeah same in Aus.
Switzerland,2ywk5h,picnicnapkin,2,Sat Mar 14 02:54:42 2015 UTC,But there's no law against it.
Switzerland,2ywk5h,batwingsuit,1 point,Sun Mar 15 11:40:29 2015 UTC,Yes there is. Art.49 C you can check here.  Link to the news
Switzerland,2ywk5h,LeSpatula,1 point,Sat Mar 14 08:26:34 2015 UTC,OK. thanks for that.

Switzerland,2ywk5h,Pronato,2,Mon Mar 16 13:37:40 2015 UTC,Yes and no. By the law a cat have to get out and have socials contacts with other cats.  Consult the article 455.1.
Switzerland,2ywk5h,Pronato,4,Fri Mar 13 14:37:09 2015 UTC,Article 455.1 Section 11 Article 80 states:  Cats kept on their own shall have daily contact with humans or visual contact with members of their own species.  So a human suffices for an indoor kitty.

Before we get into the legal business I'd like to point out two things: First: You probably parked on the property of the garage, aka privat property. They could just tow your car, which would be a lot more expensive and a lot more hassle.  Second: If you do not pay they will most likely report you to the authorities. This means you will get into a legal dispute, which will take time out of your day to resolve, and not just one or two hours. It is very likely that the time and energy spent on this issue will not be worth the CHF 40.- but that is ultimately up to you to decide.

Switzerland,2ywq83,SwissBliss,1 point,Sun Mar 15 11:50:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. That's also why you see a ton of them out on the streets.  They're reliable, comfortable, and can have all the bells and whistles, if you want to have them (heated seats, navigation system, parking sensors, etc.). Oh and the price is quite good, too. (if you look at the quality you get and compare the price to VW or Audi)  There's even a sporty modell, if that's your thing: Skoda Octavia RS.  The Octavia is available as a sedan (""Limousine"" in German) or a station-wagon / estate (""Kombi"" in German). Both offer a lot of space (even the sedan), but if you want the maximum amount of space, then go with the Kombi.  It's available in a diesel or gas version and auto or manual version."

Switzerland,2ywq83,SwissBliss,7,Sun Mar 15 15:30:31 2015 UTC,"Get an estate. In order of expensiveness you can have for example: Seat Leon ST, Skoda Octavia, Golf Variant, or Audi A4 Avant, which are all based on the same model: the Golf. Other alternatives are BMW 3 series Touring, or Volvo V60.  In the cheaper range there's the Ford Focus, Hyundai I30/I40, Toyota Verso, Renault Megane, and many, many more.   It al depends on what you have to spend. If safety and electronics is your thing, you can get a newish (2012) car with all bells and whistles starting at about 15,000 CHF.   Car quality in Switzerland is quite good overall. Lots of cars have been leased, which means well serviced. Many Swiss will not buy a second-hand car if it has more than 100,000 km on the clock though. If your budget goes above 10,000CHF, then buying a slightly less luxurious newer car is your best bet. For the same money you could also go for an older Audi, BMW, or Mercedes, but the risk of something going wrong is a lot higher, and more expensive. The fuel consumption usually is as well..."

Switzerland,2ytdgu,benz8574,12,Thu Mar 12 20:34:25 2015 UTC,"I assume you did some research about Switzerland beforehand right? So you know all about the ""very expensive"" and the ""everyone speaks English"" facts right?  What I can give you on the way: I don't know how much you'll earn or where you'll work but you should definitely look into public transportation. Depending on where you live in the US that might be uncommon but seriously here in Switzerland it's a viable alternative (even though the trains aren't as punctual as they used to be). And if you work IN the city it's really the only option because traffic is really really bad in Switzerland.  Another thing you should get used to is that stores are closed on Sundays. Only shops open are little shops  in railway stations or gas stations. But they have a very limited stock. Depending on your budget you want to shop at Denner/Lidl/Aldi (low cost) or at Coop/Migros (they have low-priced stuff but you can also find high quality products for a little more money).  If you want to know more you should ask a little more specific. I'm always happy to help!"

You don't need a car. In fact, don't even think about it. Traffic is an absolute nightmare. When the sun goes up, the traffic jam is there. When the sun goes down, it's still there. I honestly don't know why anyone bothers. Get a bike or use public transport. There's buses and trams to and from everywhere pretty much every five minutes. It pays off to live near a major train station, because then you will have trains all the way through the night. Oerlikon and Altstetten aren't bad ones. Just because you don't live in the city centre does not mean you're living far away from everything. The so-called Agglo, which appears to be describing places that used to be independent but have been annexed due to Zürich's massive growth, is very well-connected. Even the cheap food is high quality here due to legislation. It's worth to check out the Arabic and Asian supermarkets.

If you want to save money, like spending-on-hobbies money, just put all coins in your pockets aside every night. Put them in a big bowl or something and you'll have a lot of cash saved up in no time. This is important: Learn German. Take classes. Adopt Swiss German expressions. Otherwise you might end up being very, very lonely ** The thing with the local expat scene is this: It's small and tight. But there's this frame of mind where a lot of them treat this country and the people therein - even fellow expats - as a stop along the way to elsewhere.  So acquaintances are fleeting That said, if you want a pint or so, let me know. The International is my regular haunt and I like showing people around."

I recommend taking German and then learning Swiss German by slowly letting Swiss German expressions you pick up creep into your everyday use. That's how some of the expats I know have done it.

Switzerland,2ytdgu,pagkatapos,2,Sat Mar 14 19:20:53 2015 UTC,"Hey there!  Learning Swiss German from a course either online or in a sort of school is difficult to impossible. The reason for this is that there's so many different dialects out there and there's neither grammar rules nor orthography that you can apply to any of them other than There is no such thing as the temporal form known as Präteritum. Sometimes, dialects vary from village to village, only kilometers apart. A good example here is the word Moon. In standard German, it's Mond and it's also that in some dialects. However, they range from Ma to Manat to Manneschi. Other words are similar, but different from dialect to dialect. A small piece of cheese can be known as schnafel, schnifel, schnufel or schnüfeli.   As for Duolinguo's German: I've had a look at their placement test and that seems quite solid. They appear to have some issues regarding idioms such as demanding a literal translation for That's neither here nor there as opposed to the idiomatic one, but other than that, it works fine, I'd say.  I'd still recommend going to learn it at some kind of school, because languages are a living thing and should be treated as such. When doing the Duolinguo, I felt as if I was more a consumer of a language rather than interacting with it. So while I'm not trying to divert you from using it, I recommend going to classes as well.   If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."

Switzerland,2ytdgu,KingJoffreyTheBaked,4,Fri Mar 13 15:56:14 2015 UTC,Awesome.  Do you think the discounted rail pass is worth the cost for this?
Switzerland,2ytdgu,bQm_che,5,Thu Mar 12 18:39:17 2015 UTC,ETHZ may provide you with a half-price pass for free. EPFL does. Insanely useful.
Switzerland,2ytdgu,endeavourl,2,Thu Mar 12 19:02:07 2015 UTC,There are lot of discounts out there. I was in undergrad when I studied abroad in Basel and I had a Gleis 7 card which made the trains in the country free after 7pm. The age limit for it is 25 though.

First I was afraid that it's the government who wants to look into censoring games being sold here, but instead it's about games being treated as a cultural good that could in some ways be developed and fostered.  The questions at the end seem to go into the right direction: invest into education, fund collaborations between educational institutes and the gaming industry, looking into consequences of a healthy game industry.  I myself might be working in the game industry if there were more studios and the access to them were facilitated via education."

There is another company called https://www.talentsconnect.com/ that seems to exists for about 2 or three years. You can read various interviews with it's founder. (It seems to be basically a job agency that kind of works like a dating platform.) So I suspect talentsconnection.ch might be a scam, as it uses a similar name, and everything google finds is only from last year, as you also find much less informatio about this site."

Switzerland,2yrnyk,invisiblelunatic,1 point,Thu Mar 12 06:36:53 2015 UTC,"In particular, Switzerland is my dream country to pursue higher studies, especially when it comes to research, Switzerland is the best.  1. Firstly I want to know about chances of getting admission into the university either for MS or PhD. Whether the criteria of selection and success ratio of applications to University is same as like US, UK and Germany or is it less ?  2.I have selected 2 universities  a) Federal Institute of Technology b) University of Zurich I need help to choose other universities as well.   What are the specific requirements such as Toefl score, GRE score to Switzerland Universities ? I'm giving Toefl in May 2015, GRE in April last week."
Switzerland,2yrnyk,P1r4nha,2,Thu Mar 12 07:05:37 2015 UTC,"For ETHZ the application process for a PhD is this: Write the professor you want to work with an email. He will arrange everything else. I don't think they care much about your English skills but rather about your previous scientific work, papers you've published and the researchers you have worked with before. Probably also about your motivation to work with them in particular and your ideas about your future research."
Switzerland,2yrnyk,brumgabrasch,2,Thu Mar 12 08:26:24 2015 UTC,"hat are the specific requirements such as Toefl score, GRE score to Switzerland Universities ? I'm giving Toefl in May 2015, GRE in April last week.   There are two Federal Institute of Technologies, one in Lausanne (EPFL) and one in Zurich (ETHZ). Look for open positions or directly contact the professors in the research area you are interested in. A solid CV and good arguments why the professor should hire you will help. I would say at least 50% of the PHDs are not Swiss, but I don't know the exact numbers. However, this may be different depending on the field and the university."
Switzerland,2yrnyk,Starky_D,4,Thu Mar 12 10:38:17 2015 UTC,"This is purely speculative, but I would assume you need some outstanding recommendations to pursue a masters/PhD level education at a school like ETH Zurich."

I've been out there 3 or 4 times now, and the last time I went I did a two-day hike from Lauterbrunnen to Oeschinensee (which is also gorgeous) and while there were some bottlenecks of hikers on parts of the trail around Schilthorn, we encounted mostly nobody for most of the hike and when we got to Oeschinensee, we got to enjoy it mostly in peace because we stayed the night at the chalet on the lake, whereas most tourists to the lake are up there only during the daytime when the tram is running, so the evening and early morning were very serene when you take a short walk from the chalet.

Very quiet there."
Switzerland,2yjnni,newlyswissed,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:24:11 2015 UTC,I'm there basically every weekend in summer. Most beautifull spot as far as I'm concerned.  It can get a bit crowded though. Walk around the lake in the forest and you should find a more quiet place though.

When you get to this small chalet/restaurant it is completely surrounded by wilderness (forests, creeks and such, and a great view of Lake Geneva), and you can climb to that ball on the mountain in about 40 minutes, and 20 minutes back down. I've camped there many times and it's beautiful especially when you walk through those cow fields and through the forest. Find a clearing and pitch a tent. Just be aware of boars. I've never seen one but you'll definitely see the tracks they leave"

Switzerland,2yjnni,SwissBliss,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:13:59 2015 UTC,"When do you plan to go? Because it can be harder to get there in winter because they close the roads due to snow, and since the only thing up there is a small refuge and a restaurant further away, it isn't much of a big deal. In Summer there can be a few tourists but not many.  http://imgur.com/vDUI6jJ,uPRdted,t1Mzh28#0  Here is a quick map of the area with 3 pictures. Basically from Geneva you go East along the lake until you reach Nyon, then you go up to the mountain and follow that road I indicated. Once your up there you can do whatever you want. Hike (fairly easy) up to the ball (La Dole), enjoy the view of Lake Geneva on one side and France on the other, eat and chill at the refuge, and then just walk around the endless forests till you find a place to put a tent up. That whole mountain is really really amazing"

And don't think that you have to stay in the Geneva, Switzerland is small so you can be in another canton (state) in like 10 minutes with a whole other vibe and plenty of stuff to do. If I have 1 single recommendation for an event to attend it's the Paleo Festival. It's a big european festival with big artists and personally the coolest festival I've been to.

Bring a good backpack for weekend trips. It should be a nice year. Switzerland is a great place to be a student.

We love it in Canada and I had the opporunity to eat the hell out of it in Geneva. Also, it is an unbelievably expensive city. The prices there will blow your mind. I recommend getting on one of the buses to Mt. Seleve, France (about a 15 minute ride from Cornavin, the central train, bus and tram station) because wine, beer, groceries and everything is much cheaper.  EDIT: take the cable car up the mountain while you're in France. Also, eat at Tasty Chicken Spot it's cheap and open late and delicious. Go to Lausanne it's the coolest most futuristic city ever."

Walk from Hauptbahnhof (Main station) down to river and follow downstream on the hill-side. Walk past some cool graffitis, skate parks etc. and see where many young Zurich people hangout in Summer (you can swim in the river). Continue past the volley ball fields and the big brigde, then cross a diagonal bridge which brings you to Josefswiese/ Viadukt. Lot's of interesting (and probably overpriced) shops in Viadukt and interesting foods at Markthalle. Follow the viadukt to the end and walk past Yonex hall to go see the Freitag Tower (two brothers that make famous recycled bags since 10+ years). Enjoy the area and perhaps go up the Prime Tower for a coffee (Bistro Clouds), until recently the tallest building in Switzerland. Great view of the city and the train infrastructure (if that's your thing). If you have time continue your walk past Schiffbau and Puls 5, which has a very industrial flair (formerly steel melting, now stores and restaurants), continue past coffee ""Sphere"" and head back up the river back to Main station. Walking alone would be max 1-1.5h, add whatever you want for sight seeing, shopping, etc.   EDIT: One of my favorite bars is here too: Les Halles, which offers a French rustique touch and a lot of hipsters :-)"

So you have to expermiment.   You can't just use any potatoe. Good potatoes for Rösti are floury. Use something like Bintje, Desirée, Lady Felicia, Jelly, Laura or Victoria. Some people prefer raw, others prefer pre-boiled potatoes. Use butter, not oil or margarine. Even better and more old school: lard Use a big frying pan.    Try and try again. Finally you'll get a great Rösti!"

Switzerland,2ybzqe,canteloupy,3,Sun Mar 8 20:01:24 2015 UTC,"because you need the VAT to have decent income and petrol consumption is just too volatile to base such a huge amount of the state budget on.

If there isn't, so be it."
Switzerland,2ybzqe,Formagella,3,Sun Mar 8 22:30:35 2015 UTC,"because you replace a stable tax on consuming goods, which is good when the economy is thriving (which we all want) with a rather unstable tax on a totally different kind of consumption which we don't want.  Source of income and goal of the tax are totally different. Also in general I rather only like to turn one button of the system rather than two at the same time."

VAT accomplishes none of that.  Of course the big issue with financing the state is that apart from the air force and highway maintenance, most of what it does is incompressible non carbon intensive. Like hospitals or daycare. And to finance that with lower levels of consumption of the rest is a big unknown."

Switzerland,2ya2mh,Lejeune_Dirichelet,7,Mon Mar 9 16:11:51 2015 UTC,"You first need to understand that most cantons were separate countries for most of their history (~300-500 years). Shortly after Sonderbund war, a dispute emerged as to how the region should be governed from then on: either to follow the previous models that was nothing more than a loose confederation (a Staatenbund), or actually unify them as a country, like the French tried to do (a Bundesstaat). Eventually, the supporters of a Bundestaat won, and the federal Diet (""Tagsatzung"" is probably the better  English term ;-)) produced the federal constitution of 1848. As a compromise, the federal state was made to be extremely weak in relation to the cantons: it at first basically only administrated the federal army, foreign relations and introduced the unitary currency 2 years later (the federal tribunal, for example, was only created in the revision of the constitution of 1874).  Since then, the federal state has significantly grown in size (mainly during and after WW2), and the cantonal differences largely disapered; gone are the days where 20% difference in the results of popular votes between neighbouring cantons was considered the norm.  Another factor that has to be taken into account is the fact that the reasons behind many conflicts between the cantons rarely overlap: French/German/Italian speaking, Protestants vs Catholics and urban vs rural regions all allied themselves at different times against the others along different lines. I don't know the PKK very well, but if the disputes tend to align on the same inner borders, federalism doesn't work very well (take Belgium for example)."

People who vote on topics need to be informed, but not all people are informed and educated well enough to make a sensible judgment. I don't mean this in a elitist kind of way, but for some things you need basic understanding of how things work."
Switzerland,2ya2mh,Lejeune_Dirichelet,5,Sun Mar 8 00:28:28 2015 UTC,"Now in relations to direct democracy... criticizing it is kinda a big tabu in Switzerland. It has definitive advantages: it forces the citizens to participate in the political debate, which is definitely positive. Limiting the power of the government, especially the executive, to make important decisions is almost always positive.  But it also has some disadvantages: as was pointed in other parts of this subreddit, the current system promotes political parties to bring polarising and uncompromising initiatives that are aimed primarily at sharpening the image and values they defend in the general population. Getting them accepted is just a bonus.  Also, one of the requirements of direct democracy is to have an informed population that understands the issues he/she votes on, and the consequences of the different options given. Sadly, a ton of voters have no idea what exactly will change when they vote on an issue, what the main arguments are, etc. and tend to just make up their own (inaccurate) solution as to how a (sometimes quite technical) issue needs to be solved.  Both problems definitely exist and have to be addressed. But IMO, there are certainly ways with which they could be dealt with without jeopardizing direct democracy."
Switzerland,2ya2mh,hikari-boulders,3,Sun Mar 8 03:44:34 2015 UTC,"it forces the citizens to participate in the political debate   It enables the citizen. DDR, China, Cuba and North Korea forces the citizens to participate in the political debate. Sorry for nitpicking but I think this is an important distinction.   Limiting the power of the government, especially the executive, to make important decisions is almost always positive.   You're absolutely right!   the current system promotes political parties to bring polarising and uncompromising initiatives   I think that any other (less direct) system can do that, too, and in that case political discussion become of a sharade.   Sadly, a ton of voters have no idea what exactly will change when they vote on an issue.   Sadly, a ton of congressmen in less direct democracies have no idea what exactly will change when they vote on an issue."
Switzerland,2ya2mh,Lejeune_Dirichelet,2,Sun Mar 8 16:05:37 2015 UTC,"It enables the citizen   True. ""forces"" was too strong; rather, direct democracy incites citizens that have an opinion to participate.   I think that any other (less direct) system can do that, too, and in that case political discussion become of a sharade.   Also true, but the system we have know gives a cheap and convenient way for parties to advertise their views in everybody's letterboxes. With all due respect, this strategy is IMHO an abuse of a political mechanism that was intended to be the absolute last resort to a political issue by amending the constitution.   Just look at today's votations: the CVP wanted to remind everyone that they support families, and the GLP thought it was a good idea to give themselves an identity ahead of the federal elections later this year. The wording of both initiatives was either sloppy or overly radical, no wonder almost nobody voted for them. My point being, the parties should only resort to an initiative when they actualy want it to see it in the constitution, not use it for their own propaganda."
Switzerland,2ya2mh,Formagella,2,Sun Mar 8 17:52:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the assumption that active voters (not citizens) are on average ignorant boors compared to their political representatives holds true.  If I look at the democratic decisions reached by pure representative democracies and compare them with those reached by Switzerland with its semidirect democracy (meaning: the people can vote, but at the end of the day the deviation from the decisions of the representatives is not as big as it looks), it looks like they aren't that ignorant after all."

Who is paying for these campaigns? How much air time does everyone get? Which companies finance parties? Nobody knows and apparently nobody cares enough to make a law.  Also the highly fragmented landscape of political power here with towns and cantons voting on lots of stuff often promotes an every man for himself and NIMBY attitude. Every canton wants to lower taxes so they can poach companies from the others, perequation helps a bit but not that much especially since some cantons have most of the kids and infrastructure to take care of while others are havens of rich people chalets and a bunch of letterboxes. Also from the point of view of land use and development this led to opportunistic behavior until we had the recent federal law.  Any way, it's not a bad system but there are particular pitfalls at things being decentralized. And citizen are not immune to the influence of money in politics."

When I go to Switzerland, (I'm Irish/Swiss) its interesting to think that tax in Zurich in like 20% while in Zug its only 7%. Many companies try to go to Zug because of this, and today what was once a little farming canton is now a quickly built up industrial area! Its really sad; we went there as kids to our summer house which was all lovely fields but now the surrounding area near our house is just built up. I don't know if Switzerland will implement a tax reform, but if they do, they need to focus on where these companies can be built as to not potentially damage the lovely Swiss plains."
Switzerland,2ya2mh,canteloupy,1 point,Sun Mar 8 08:57:44 2015 UTC,"That is not the problem with Zug.

The problem about this is that the size of the cantons varies considerably: Central Switzerland (0.7M inhabitants) counts as five cantons, while Zurich (1.4M inhabitants) counts as one. Therefore a voter in e.g. Appenzell (Inner Rhodes) has more than forty times the electoral weight of a voter in Zurich — not exactly a feature of democracy. In fact, there have been many referendums which had a broad majority in the population, but were denied to them by Central Switzerland.   The joke is that to fix this, you'd need to change the constitution — which obviously won't get a cantonal majority, since Central Switzerland is very fond of its privilege."

How do you know that this ""quirk"" didn't save our asses? For this, you would need to look at those particular votes and see in which cases the quirk ""helped us"" and in which cases the quirk ""cost us good stuff"".  Also there is another issue: Even if all of the quirked votes were actually bad (i.e. it would be better if they have been voted the other way around), you have no basis to say that the quirk is negative. Because you would need 100+ years of experience without the quirk and thenn compare (A) experiences with the quirk with (B) experiences without the quirk. Or, to sum it up in one sentence: If you remove the quirk, how do you know that there won't be vote à la ""the biggest three cantons get all the money and the others are fucked""? What stops the big cantons from voting Yes?  The quirk comes directly from the constitution, I think even in one of the very first paragraphs (if not the first).

Att ha jobbat i Sverige och respektive Schweiz är även bra för mitt CV tillsammans med att jag fortfarande känner mig som schweizare och inte svensk. Har alltid snarare sett mig som gäst här i Sverige. :-)
Switzerland,2ybxbw,SazzeTF,1 point,Mon Mar 9 07:17:04 2015 UTC,"Jaha. Självklart är det finansiell visat en bra idé att komma och jobba hit. Kom ihåg, du får Erwerbsersatz när du är i arméen eller i civilplikten här som är minst 62+5 CHF per dag. Om du jobbar här först och tjänar mer än denna 2000 kan du få max typ 250 per dag. Om du alltså tar beslutet att komma tillbaka hit och därför ""tvingas"" att tjäna i arméen ska du iaf få pengar."
Switzerland,2ybxbw,Motzlord,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:46:14 2015 UTC,"Bra info! Jag antar att du själv är svensk och bor i Schweiz? Får jag isf fråga vad du jobbar med och hur du ser på jobb- samt boendesituationen, generellt sett i den tyska delen?  Beroende på hur det känns när jag väl har flyttat och bott i Schweiz igen utvärderar jag nog vad som känns mest värt och lönsamt för mina närmaste 5-10 år. Planerar inte att gifta mig eller skaffa barn förrän jag är 30+ hur som helst så att flytta runt blir inget problem för mig för den delen heller."
Switzerland,2ybxbw,SazzeTF,1 point,Mon Mar 9 16:02:58 2015 UTC,Tack så länge men jag är faktisk bara en schweizare som har lärt sig svenska pga sin svenskspråkig flickvän. ;)  Jag kan inte berätta så mycket om jobbsituationen - men om du avslutar skolan snart och vill bara tjäna lite pengar på en typ av längre sommarjobb är det realistisk. Många butiker behöver alltid kassörskor och de betalar helt bra pengar. Typ 25 CHF/t. Det kan bl.a. bara svårt att hitta ett lägenhet i de stora städerna men om du söker nåt lite utanför är det mycket enklare. Jag anser att det är alltid möjlig att hitta något jobb men det har blivit svårare under de senaste åren.  Om du vill göra som du har sagt kan det vara helt kul för dig. Men såna low level jobs betalar bara okej och beroende på hur mycket hyra du betalar kan det vara att du har inte så mycket kvar i slutet av månaden. Som du vet är skit dyr här. Men om du har en högre utbildning och hittar en bra jobb kan det också gå jävla bra.
Switzerland,2ybxbw,Motzlord,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:51:21 2015 UTC,"Då måste jag gratulera dig på din utmärkta svenska! Det enda jag kan korrigera dig på är att det heter ""skitdyrt"". ;)   Jag avslutar gymnasiet om 1 och 1/4 år. Efter det kommer jag jobba för att få ihop lite kapital och bara njuta av livet lite. Jag har länge funderat på att ge mig in i läraryrket på gymnasienivå vilket verkar skilja sig lite mellan Sverige och Schweiz. Har jag förstått rätt så måste jag alltså ha en MA i respektive ämne jag vill lära ut i Schweiz? Antar att jag även måste ha någon pedagogisk examen? Funderar nämligen på att plugga här istället för i Schweiz för att det blir väldigt mycket billigare på alla möjliga sätt. Funderar annars att plugga politik & finans vilket nästan är vår nationalsyssla hemma i Schweiz. :P"
Switzerland,2ybxbw,SazzeTF,1 point,Tue Mar 10 16:49:58 2015 UTC,"Tackar :) Det är sant, Schweiz är skitdyrt, men vad skulle jag säga om vår skit var också dyrt? ;)  Du antar rätt. Jag är inte helt säker men jag tror att det fungerar så här: Du pluggar till Bachelor med idealvis två ämnen som kan läras i gymnasiet. T.e. Tyska och engelska. Sedan ska du fortsätta med en Master i en av dina Bachelorinriktningar och samtidig börja lärarutbildningen. Du kan förstås också göra en normal Master först och sedan lärarutbildingen men om du redan vet vad du vill jobba med vore det lite dumt. Jag hittade denna sidan som har lite fler detaljer.  Man tjänar riktig bra som gymnasielärare, AFAIK. Men jag måste säga att jag skulle rekommendera att studera i Sverige om jag var du, jag vet att det finna många finansiella fördelar. Men jag vet inte om man kan bara jobba med en utländsk diplom här eller inte men jag antar att det går inom Europa. Ganska många tyskar jobbar här i denna yrken iaf, därför tror jag att det är definitiv möjligt.  Om du vill bara tjäna lite pengar efter gymnasiet är det säkert en möjlighet att komma hit, men det vore bra om du hade nånstans att stanna i början. Kanske har du folk här i Schweiz?"
Switzerland,2ybxbw,Motzlord,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:59:59 2015 UTC,"Well for starters you don't have to do the service unless you life in Switzerland.  And if you have moral problems with serving in the military you can quite easily do civil service instead.  Regarding the military service. Normally it's 21 weeks of boot camp and then after this you have to finish you're obligatory service days (for soldiers 260 days minus the days you've got from boot camp). This normally happens each year with 3 weeks repetition courses.  You also have the option for most jobs to serve full time which let's you finish your military service in 300 days in one piece.  One thing to note about civil service, you're expected to do 1.5 times the service days compared to military service."

Also, you can just make something up that's wrong with you medically, like back pains or some shit and then they won't take you. It's not something I'd recommend though, it feels like cheating. But I know plenty of people who've done that. You'll have to pay Wehrpflichtersatz though."
Switzerland,2ybxbw,SazzeTF,1 point,Sun Mar 8 12:52:03 2015 UTC,How much exactly is the Wehrpflichtersatz? What i seem to find it's about 3% of your salary and has to be at least 400 CHF?

Canada, Israel? new zealand ? England is already weak in Europe. They won't take serious actions in their position. They could do damage in the case of the illegal actions of Swiss banks on their soil, but not in the Snowden case."
Switzerland,2y5ten,roscocoltrane,-3,Fri Mar 6 20:18:58 2015 UTC,"warning: unpopular comment below, but you may see more context in following comments (I like Snowden but I don't like spying in CH).  I also feel that we should, although law should be enforced to show we don't tolerate espionage: something like a few months of jail, no biggie.  however, that's my feeling as a simple citizen/newspaper reader and those decisions are probably better made by professionals.  edit: liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding three years or to a monetary penalty."
Switzerland,2y5ten,leo_037,10,Fri Mar 6 19:48:27 2015 UTC,"Wait, who do you want to put in jail for espionage? Snowden? Because then I think you have misunderstood the article."
Switzerland,2y5ten,Kazumara,6,Fri Mar 6 23:54:58 2015 UTC,"Snowden is widely known for his whistleblowing, but he committed espionage in GE before, right? are we tolerating that? are we forgetting that our law forbids it?  sure, the article was not about whether or not we should tolerate espionage, but I thought it would be relevant that if we do him a huge favor, we still prosecute him.  CIA etc. are glorified in movies, but espionage remains illegal. I shouldn't have to remind it here btw (since that's the general theme with Snowden). I don't see how his heroic actions would credibly mean we forget his breaking our laws, on our soil, in our disfavor.  edit:   not sure if espionage is the right term, but in a layman's mind (mine), CIA=espionage. CC art. 272 defines it as:   political intelligence-gathering services [...] to the detriment of Switzerland or its citizens, inhabitants or organisations,"
Switzerland,2y5ten,leo_037,2,Sat Mar 7 09:25:49 2015 UTC,"I have never heard of him commiting espionage before and after a short search all I could come up with was that he was a systems administrator with the CIA and stationed in Geneva in 2007.  Are there any suspicions against him, is there something I missed?  I generally agree that he should still be held responsible if there is anything. It is a totally different situation to his whostleblowing after all."
Switzerland,2y5ten,Kazumara,2,Sat Mar 7 09:40:17 2015 UTC,"okay, so I mostly wrote a hasty ""presumed guilty"" opinion (sorry), based on my previous knowledge that he:   worked for the CIA in GE under a diplomatic cover: I don't know how automatically that amounts to committing espionage (CC art. 272) or maybe unlawful activities on behalf of a foreign state (CC art. 271) or something I'm not aware of) was somehow associated with the shady recruitment of a banker: turns out he seems to only be a witness to that (according to himself, which is debated by Ueli Maurer)... don't know either if being a witness to various CIA stuff in GE makes him prosecutable for not denouncing them.   so now I've found this:   By 2007, the CIA stationed him with diplomatic cover in Geneva, Switzerland. His responsibility for maintaining computer network security meant he had clearance to access a wide array of classified documents.  [...]  He described as formative an incident in which he claimed CIA operatives were attempting to recruit a Swiss banker to obtain secret banking information. Snowden said they achieved this by purposely getting the banker drunk and encouraging him to drive home in his car. When the banker was arrested for drunk driving, the undercover agent seeking to befriend him offered to help, and a bond was formed that led to successful recruitment.   source: http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance   However, the story of Snowden's escapades in Switzerland was mainly media hype, Maurer said. The Swiss Foreign Ministry has asked the U.S. embassy in Bern to check what really happened.  Maurer told another Swiss Sunday paper, NZZ am Sonntag, that it was up to the judicial authorities to decide whether or not to launch a criminal investigation into Snowden, but the Swiss cabinet would back such a move as a formality, he said.   source: http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/16/us-usa-security-switzerland-snowden-idUSBRE95F09120130616  search results for NZZ am Sonntag snowden maurer, not read yet:  http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/schweiz/ueli-maurer-fuer-strafuntersuchung-1.18100003  http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-president-calls-for-foreign-spy-inquiries/36168066  http://www.handelszeitung.ch/politik/maurer-fuer-untersuchung-gegen-us-spion-genf  I'm running out of time (and frankly out of motivation, I don't care enormously actually, some people are paid for this) but:   maybe someone would like to look deeper into that especially: I'm wondering if you can be known to have worked for the CIA, anywhere or even in CH, and then not be worried once you come back to CH... my point is: the CIA's activities are routinely glorified or maybe banalized, but isn't it an organization that no nation (even the US actually, I think by definition the CIA operates abroad) would allow to operate on its soil (unless they are doing something together)?"

International law / treaties / rules / organisations are very complex and it's difficult to apply a ruling from one situation to others.   Think of it this way: Asylum means ""I can no longer live in my own country because X, please harbour me in yours"". If it is political asylum, i.e. the refugee has to be afraid that he will be (unjustly) discriminated/prosecuted and imprisoned in his own country, then it makes very little sense to just hand them back over to their government. Extradition works through requests, and those requests can be denied for various reasons (think Polanski), and one valid reason would be ""No, he is a refugee and has been granted asylum"".   There is currently a case in Germany where a US-Soldier defected and asked for asylum. This has been going on for several years and he still has not been extradited, and he will not be if Germany were to grant him his request."

Racism/xenophobia is culturally accepted here, e.g. you can totally get away with complaining about the 'arrogant, fucking Germans that all come here and take our jobs'.

Sorry but doing something extreme (like accepting stupid initiatives) just to express your disagreement is teenager behavior and clearly shows that such people should not be allowed to vote. The constitution is not the right place to express discontent. Either we introduce some kind of minimum requirement for voting rights (e.g. you need to pass a test, likewise for car driving license) or even better we finally get rid of Volksinitiativen. They literally serve no purpose, I can't think of any useful Volksinitiative. It's all far right or far left wing populism that destabilize the country. And someone need to tell the Swiss that their democracy is shit. Seriously. The Swiss are so complacent and arrogant, I'm ashamed to be part of it. It's absurd how people think that more democracy is always better. It clearly isn't.

Dumb voters are one of the biggest problem any democracy has IMHO. Usually (dumb) Volkinitiatives get denied BUT usually countered with a more sensible approach. IMHO this forces the parliament to do something about things they'd otherwise would not do anything or do something most of the people would not support.  Look at the countries around us. They are not any better. Look at Germany, dumb voters vote their popular candidate which then does bullshit for some time because voters have absolutely no way to influence the action. Then comes election time, so politicians make up promises to get (re-)elected but never fulfill them. I think the Volkinitiative are a way to keep a overreaching parliament in check - even if it means that sometimes a stupid initives get passed.  I mean, the democratic system is not perfect, not our variant, not the American or British variant. But it's the best thing we have right now.  Regarding the obstacles... Well it depends on where you are. Which is not optimal, agreed. Cost wise - I dunno? Are you refering to the fees? Which are less than CHF 1000 AFAIK?

I can't tell you that much about Zurich and such but let's just say that the french speaking parts are usually more open minded.

I've been told by Germans even they can't completely understand the swiss. But they will speak to you in high German (the German spoken in Germany) if you speak to them in it."
Switzerland,2xz19q,ruggar,12,Thu Mar 5 01:53:13 2015 UTC,"I know this is semantics but Swiss German is not a dialect in my opinion. Swiss German has a different grammar (fewer time forms, fewer cases) and a different vocabulary. Pronunciation is also different, so if you think Dutch is a different language, then Swiss German must be so too.  There are Germans who understand Swiss German, namely those with Alemannic roots (Baden-Württemberg, respectively Schwaben). Anybody further north in Germany often doesn't understand a word. As an anecdote: often, when Germans claim they understand Swiss German, they are actually hearing a Swiss Person trying to speak standard (high) German. The customary pronunciation of high German in Switzerland as it is used in schools an politics is so particular to Switzerland, that it sounds like a dialect to Germans."
Switzerland,2xz19q,airaqua,3,Thu Mar 5 06:16:19 2015 UTC,"You're right, Swiss German is not one dialect but a collection of different dialectal varieties. Dialectal varieties (as well as diastratic and diaphasic ones) always have different lexical items. Grammar is often different but still complete.  If a certain variety develops into a an own language or not has mostly to do with extralinguistic factors (e.g. political, cultural etc.). Mutual understanding is not really a criteria since there are varieties of one language, which are not mutually understandable (e.g. Mandarin/Cantonese), but also different languages which are mutually understandable (e.g. Swedish/Norwegian)."
Switzerland,2xz19q,ruggar,1 point,Thu Mar 5 22:20:49 2015 UTC,Very interesting! If I understand you correctly the distinguishing element between dialect and language is political or social?
Switzerland,2xz19q,airaqua,4,Fri Mar 6 05:31:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly :) Whereas languages are typically prestigious, official and written, dialects are mostly spoken and unofficial. Of course, the situation in Switzerland is a special one since we have diglossia (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diglossia). Thus dialects are not negatively looked on as it is the case in Germany for instance.  If we wanted ""Swiss German"" to become an own language, there would be several steps to be taken:   selection: choose one dialect codification: process of standardization (it needs a regognized grammar, a dictionary and a standard pronunciation) elaboration (language policy, language status) acceptance by those who will speak it (basically the most important step)   However, there is another possibility. Instead of choosing one dialect, you can also create an artificial one (cf. Romansh ins Switzerland)."
Switzerland,2xz19q,LeGama,2,Fri Mar 6 10:35:18 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'm an American...so I'm going to agree with what you said. I really don't know any of the particulars of the language. All I can say is that the Austrians, and Germans I worked with had trouble understanding the Swiss sometimes."
Switzerland,2xz19q,argh523,1 point,Thu Mar 5 06:55:14 2015 UTC,"The thing is that the difference between language and dialect is not very well defined. Dutch is a language because they've been using the Amsterdam dialect in written form in the region for centuries. Even then, it was considered to be just a german dialect by germans, because there was no clear border between german and dutch dialects. This all changed after the world wars.  In Switzerland, no written form of any dialect, or any other standard, was able to compete with standard german. It probably helped that standard german was primarily a written language based on middle and mostly high german dialects, and as such similar to swiss german dialects, while dutch is based on a less related low german dialect.  In the end, what makes or breaks the language status is if the speakers themselfs see themselfs as speaking a seperate language. And that doesn't really seem to be the case in switzerland. We all understand standard german even before we learn it in school just through watching some tv. And the other dialects are just as weird, or weirder, than standard german. So it's not even clear what ""Swiss German"" would actually look like. Is Bärndütsch the swiss german, and everything else is just dialects? If you pick one dialect over another, it's not a whole lot different from what we've got going on already with standard german, and there have never been any efforts to create a common standard. For all those reasons, it's hard to argue that swiss german is more than a collection of german dialects.  But who knows? Collectively, teenagers on their mobile phones have probably written more swiss german than anything that was ever written down in all of history before. Maybe something will come out of this some day."

Switzerland,2xv1oz,Ciderglove,2,Wed Mar 4 13:23:10 2015 UTC,"How experienced are you in winter hiking? We still have enough snow in the alps that you either stick to the boring, lower tracks and paved streets or at least snowshoes are mandatory.   Hiking with snowshoes (or even using skis) can be done in the areas you described and can be very nice. However you need to be quite competent to go to the higher regions and off the beaten track. With the warmer weather the danger of avalanches increases drastically. I don't go hiking alone or without proper avalanche rescue gear at this time of the year.   If you are not experienced with these conditions I suggest you stick to the easier tracks usually marked with pink signs (snowshoe routes) which unfortunately most of the time are round tracks, so you end where you started."

Switzerland,2xpa1r,SwissBliss,1 point,Tue Mar 3 14:11:26 2015 UTC,"I really don't know, why so many people are obsessed with taxing marijuana, when it comes to legalization. And how will it even save 1 CHF worth in tax money?  If marijuana will be legalized, the police (esp. the drug enforcement subsidiary) will simply reallocate their force but definitely not reduce it. This is like believing in Samichlaus. They will start to crack down other drugs and illegal substances, harass peaceful people and making their life difficult. Prosecutors and courts will be as busy as they are now.  Even more if it will be taxed. This will create new legislation which has to be controlled and enforced by new or existing state/cantonal agencies. So for example, the current raids of plantations justified by drug prohibition laws, become raids justified by regulatory laws for marijuana production. Bravo!/S To me, it doesn't sound a lot of crime was reduced or tax money saved.  I'm absolutely not sure, why swiss press and people always glorify Colorado. Must be a smoke cloud or something. Looking at Colorado from a critical view, from an initially estimated $100M in recreational tax earnings, they very quickly had to lower the estimate to $31M. At the end of the year the check balanced at $44M. This number will melt even more, when surrounding states also legalize the use of recreational marijuana, as 45% of the sales in CO are from out-of-state-customers. And even with medical and recreational marijuana, guess who is stepping in if the legal market can not fulfill the demand or prices are simply too high.  Yes, the marijuana business could be a peaceful venture, if the state and his paid goons, would not drive producers, sellers and consumers into illegality. And now we even turn to the state, that caused the problem in the first place, and ask for a solution. In my book, that borders on insanity."
Switzerland,2xpa1r,laulauder,6,Wed Mar 4 23:47:16 2015 UTC,I don't like marijuana/cannabis and usually see users as stupid people. But I think it should be as legal as alcohol and tobacco.
Switzerland,2xpa1r,SwissBliss,3,Tue Mar 3 09:08:44 2015 UTC,Do you have the same opinion about the other 2 drugs you mentioned?
Switzerland,2xpa1r,SwissBliss,5,Tue Mar 3 11:06:52 2015 UTC,"Let's say I despise every people that feel proud/thrilled to announce that they are users of any kind of drug (cannabis / tobacco / alcohol / MDMA/Ecstasy / LSD / Cocaine).  And I feel really sorry for people that are users of highly addictive drugs (heroin / meth / crack).  If you want to get into any type of drug, ok. But why do you have to feel proud of it?  to me r/trees is the equivalent of r/alcohol r/cocaine r/tobacco r/LSD  I have very close friends that outsmart me and are occasional users of LSD / MDMA / alcohol,  they just remain discrete with it and I am totally fine with it."
Switzerland,2xpa1r,laulauder,3,Tue Mar 3 11:59:34 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. The thing is that weed is different than cigarettes or Alcohol. Neither of those give you a different outlook on various things. Alcohol makes for good stories and that's about it. I think people who are proud to use a drug are overcompensating because they want to make it seem as normal as possible to make it seem normal to others. In my opinion that's not the best way to get people to understand weed but whatever.   The reason /r/trees is so big is because weed inspires creativity, which fits well on a Subreddit. Another reason is because it's the softest drug that also has a notable effect on you. For example no one would really discuss their experience with crack on here, and on the other hand there's not much to say about cigarettes.   Just out of curiosity have you ever tried it? I'm not a stoner by any means, last time I had some was maybe 6 months ago, and before that id be responsible with it and have it maybe 1-2 times a month with some friends"

And I can't disagree about the adventure holidays, cause I love that too. Paranoia depends on the user, but mostly on what you are smoking. I've had great stuff that made me so happy and just want to go on an adventure with some friends, and other stuff that made me feel dizzy and not that great (was mixed with tobacco which I hate). I would never take back those amazing experiences where I would just see nature, music, people differently and in an amazingly refreshing way, without taking a hard drug like LSD or Shrooms (to me those are hard). I would never hallucinate on weed of course, but just see colors brighter, laugh with friends that I wouldn't usually hang out with, and feel great for a few hours.  Overall, neither of us are wrong. As someone who has had it before, and probably will occasionally, I'd love for it to be at least partly legalised for many reasons (why not, money, safety, forward thinking view). At the same time I wouldn't everyone to become like Snoop Dogg, but I doubt that would happen."
Switzerland,2xpa1r,laulauder,3,Tue Mar 3 19:15:19 2015 UTC,"I agree that neither of us is wrong. I think that whether the substance is harmful or not (any substances). Penalizing it has never and will never benefit the population. When you penalize it, some dealers are ready to fight/kill to avoid jail-time or to have the supremacy of the market. There is not a single country on the surface of this planet that has won the war on drugs by enhancing the severity of their policies on drugs.  On the other side it has always been an electoral plus to claim you would raise the budget on the war on drugs... since Carter and his ''war on drugs'' program.  Because voters naïvely think it will cure the problem. Stats sadly show that every time a country has risen its budget on drugs penalization, it has never lowered drug use and always risen drug related crime. It seems obvious that de-penalizing drug use, and taxing drugs as we do with tobacco and alcohol is not the perfect solution but seems to be the least worst solution. That money would fit so well in drug-related education programs and rehab programs."

Switzerland,2xpa1r,Rasputin94,1 point,Tue Mar 3 15:05:30 2015 UTC,"The main difference between the drugs (and I will call alcohol a drug for the sake of this argument) is the amount of harm they do.  Weed is always near the bottom of the list. In terms of least harmful to most harmful, it goes like this:  DMT Weed LSD MDMA Cocaine Alcohol Meth Heroin  I was probably the biggest druggie out of all of my friends (psychedelics, primarily, and weed) and yet, I still finished my engineering degree without much difficulty. LSD and MDMA are pretty harmless overall; they're only harmful when you throw SSRI or MAOI anti-depressants into the mixture. DMT is safe even with MAOI anti-depressants, though, which I find fucking cool."
Switzerland,2xpa1r,Chrisixx,1 point,Tue Mar 3 17:04:33 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/K0LhDhg.   http://imgur.com/Q3vEq6j  As I only have access to the mobile version, please person my editing.    First of all, even though I am a doctor, I don't trust myself when it comes to form a personal opinion on how to rank drugs based on their hazard. So I surely won't trust you, based on your personal opinion. But in contrast I think It's interesting to see what experts on drugs from a few institutions like the NIH say. I linked 2 expert opinions on drugs hazard ranking so we can share a common ground on what we are talking about.     So your ranking is not completely far from those of a few experts, except for weed...    In order to have the authority to establish what is harmful or not we should have the correct epidemiological tools applied rightfully to the adequate population of druggies. Which neither of us has.     I am myself biased, as I have seen enough weed addicts in my practice even though I recognize it does not seem to be a problem as big as cocaine or heroin. But again this is a personal view that is worthless in this context. As worthless as your personal experience of drugs in the context of your bright career.      An a more personal note, bravo for your career.  And I have myself tried most of those that you put on the top o your list when I was a student except for DMT which I acknowledge it seems pretty cool. I don't spontaneously brag about it, but as we are talking about it...  And by the way, why did you answer today so late to this comment that was posted so long ago?"
Switzerland,2xpa1r,SwissBliss,1 point,Thu May 28 07:21:15 2015 UTC,"While I respect your opinion as a doctor, I have tried various ones on myself and documented their effects. My findings report the following about drugs:   Phenethylamines have a higher potential for vasoconstriction and stimulant effects. Sweating, tremors, temperature sensitivity are common with these. 2,5-dimethoxy (2C) series causes more temperature sensitivity and wave-like effects. A few exhibit MAOI effects, particularly when a sulfur-based group is on the #4 position of the benzene ring, which gives rise to the ALEPH and 2C-T-* series. 2C-T-7 is infamous for being a potent MAOI when insufflated, but relatively okay when taken orally, so long as nothing else is taken with it. I cautioned those taking 2C-T-2 from insufflation for similar reasons, and strongly advised they stick to an oral dosage. Cannabis can cause dependence (and in that sense, psychological addiction) in some users, but its sudden cessation of usage is not necessarily physically harmful like it would be with benzodiazepines or prolonged usage of opiates. Thus, because of those factors, and the fact that both of those it is compared against for anxiety and pain management respectively, I believe it to be a safer (and possibly less-effective) alternative based on that factor. Coupled with that there is still no definitive lethal dosage known, and very few (if any) drug interactions. Maybe SSRIs and MAOIs have adverse reactions with cannabis, but I have yet to see many reports of that - you're the doctor though, I am sure you might have better access to that sort of thing than I do. Tryptamines have the lowest risk as a whole, in terms of dose-lethal dose ratio. For instance, DMT and LSD are well over 100x the lethal dose to an active dose. Psilocybin is up there too. The only ones that I have seen that go against this, so far, are the 5-Methoxy derivatives of tryptamines, which do pose some risk at higher doses, but most users wouldn't be inclined to seek such high doses. For example, once I gave someone 5-MeO-MiPT that was active at about 5-8mg, and they asked for 18. 12mg didn't work for them, and so I gave them about 15mg - past 20mg is where there are a lot more incidents of hospitalization, and thus, the closer they got to that dosage, the more weary I was. I digress, but an interesting note for sure, no?   I believe the FDA (I could be wrong, I know it was some authoritative organization involved with medicine) said that MDMA should be schedule 3 instead of schedule 1, citing medicinal purposes and low-moderate potential for addiction, and safe clinical usage when pharmaceutically pure.   LSD treats and prevents cluster headaches at a high efficacy rate (though I am sure sumatriptan has a pretty good efficacy rate as welll), and also treats alcoholism effectively at nearly 48% efficacy rate. Psilocybin, while pharmacologically and structurally different, also has similar results - both are based off the indole molecule (but that's not to say that K2/Spice/Synthetic Weed would have similar results, as it is also based off indole).  And yes, neither of us have the tools, and rudimentary science can only have so much legitimacy. But yet, what's to keep someone from studying how medical studies are done, and doing it in a sort of black-book, off-the-official-research way? It takes about 30 samples for a population to be considered statistically valid at lower estimates, and can increase much more from there. Luckily, places like Erowid.org have reports of people trying NUMEROUS things, and can act as a primary source in many senses - you read enough reports, you get the gist of the timeline and what the compound does, and it even records what other things you had done in combination with the substance in question.  DMT, so far, is the only compound I know of which is safe to combine with an MAOI, and SSRI, an SNRI, or sober. I think weed would almost match, but I'm almost positive there's a complex tryptamine embedded somewhere in its 400+ chemicals which might cause an adverse reaction to an MAOI, but that has yet to be seen either. Not going to rule it out, though.  And as to why I brought up a dead thread? I was bored, used a search bar, was drunk, and gave my input on a topic I feel passionate about. Plus I'm kind of the 'go-to' guy for illegal drug information from my friends, so I tell them what pharmacological interactions are ill-advised (SSRIs and MAOIs as a categorical imperative are not good combinations, especially if either's usage has been within 2 weeks of the current drug's usage)."

Take Crystal Meth as an example. It is the most addictive drug currently on the market, it gets you high and then it fucking ruins you. I mean that literally, your body will be a complete wreck after several months, and the blow will be so heavy that you cannot completely recover from that, ever. And when that happens, he's a problem for society. Health insurance, social worker, yadda yadda. It's the same logic as why you must wear your seatbelts - on one hand, it's your own fault if you get seriously hurt or even die, and it's not my problem, on the other hand you will cost a shitload of money that society will have to provide, so there are some rules.   The prboblem with the prescription model is that it can and will fail at times, and that people who don't get one / don't get it renewed will drift into illegality the same way they already do today, which means it did not improve the situation in the slightest and potentially only made it worse."
Switzerland,2xpa1r,Fixxel,1 point,Tue Mar 3 17:59:34 2015 UTC,"As you describe crystal meth, this would be a prescription drug. That's why I say 'side-effects on society', they are on the heavy side here.  There would have to be some rules for the non-prescription drugs too, like the limits on alcohol  sale to minors.  I know that the prescription model can fail at times. There are doctors who prescribe when they should not. Pharmacists who overlook the prescription requirements, etc. However the current 'war on drugs' model clearly has not worked either. I prefer a system failing non-violently over one failing violently every day. The prescription model also would have two distinct advantages: One it kills the huge margins on smuggling, producing illegally, etc. the second is that the remaining addicts would have a safe, clean supply for their needs."

The problem with this model is that it usually assumes that the people who get one will use that, and only that, for their needs. They forget about the people who do not get a perscription, which will be many (otherwise the whole model makes no sense) and that they will not just give up / not take drugs, but pursue the same channels they are already using to date."

If you have a very restrictive prescription practice, there is some truth in it.  But your run of the mill heroin addict should be able to got to his practitioner and get a prescription for the drug.   As for the price, you'll have a base price for the good and legal stuff, the illegal stuff can not be much more expensive because people will use the legal stuff instead. Of course, if the government taxes it a lot, there may be a new market/opportunity to gain margin there, like we have it with cigarettes.   They forget about the people who do not get a prescription, which will be many (otherwise the whole model makes no sense) and that they will not just give up / not take drugs, but pursue the same channels they are already using to date. Yes, there will be. But there already are.   My aim is not to prevent people from taking drugs, they'll find a way. My aim is to cut down on criminality, opportunity for mafia and war on drugs occupying our police forces.  The real test would be to see if such a policy increases the abuse of such substances or not. I'm sure it is mostly not. There are and will be people who abuse, lets give them a way to do that with the least negative impact on society."

Honestly, the european view of ""freedom"" of speech/opinion is usually a farce. Issues like this one is exactly why free speech was initially called for. Europe has never really got it. And no, insulting someone does not restrict the insulted person's ""freedom"" as many europeans like to claim; insulting someone is exactly the reason we need freedom.  Again, we have no freedom of speech. Never existed. What we have is a general prohibition of insulting a foreign government, religion, ethnicity, group, police officer and person with money and rank.

There's this rustic brasserie in a corner of the old town when you walk up from the university. Their speciality is Moules in a big pot with white wine sauce and Röschti, so like a Swiss variation of Moules et Frites. It's so good, I would travel 3h to Geneva just for that if I had the time. Maybe a local knows which one I mean."
Switzerland,2xp2ay,DeepDuh,2,Tue Mar 3 05:38:55 2015 UTC,"I'm a resident. I, like others, recommend the old city (Vieille Ville). Maison Tavel is a free museum in the oldest home in Geneva - they have an amazing scale model of the city on the top floor - If I recall, it's made out of zinc and represents the city when it still had its wall. Down the street from the museum (to your right if facing Maison Tavel), you can see the last remaining sconce from (I believe) the 12th century when they lighted the city with flaming pitch and tar balls. There are a ton of other interesting historical sites to see in the Old City, but I'll let you do some of the research on that. ;-) View from top of the cathedral is super - you will need to enter the cathedral and pay 5CHF to climb up, if I recall correctly. For dinner, I would recommend going for classic fondue if you will be visiting during a relatively colder time of year. Carouge is just across the Arve river from Geneva proper - easily reached via a short walk and then Tram 12 from the old city - and there is a restaurant there called Au Vieux Carouge that would be perfect. Carouge has a completely different feel to Geneva as it was built as part of the Kingdom of Sardinia - it is quite magical at night. Also, MAKE SURE to reserve a table in advance for any restaurant, or you may end up SoL. Good luck!"

Keep in mind that life contains multiple ways, like a son becoming a rapist or a bankrobber or drug criminal (why do we always imagine our kids becoming nobel prize winners?)

There have been enough success stories of authistic children gaining back their ability of communication once the heavy metal got removed from their body.  I hope this helps.

If it's buying the person behind you their coffee to brighten their day (but actually to make yourself feel better) then no, the Swiss don't care. If it's making chit chat, then only with a select few. But if it's calling the ambulance, helping demented ladies cross roads or reading the packaging in shops for people who forget their glasses - then yeah, I'd say the Swiss do care.

My perspective is from living long-term in two regions of canada and a short while in mexico. I've lived in Switzerland for 3 years now. These four areas differ dramatically in the obligations that people feel towards others based on social distance, and even in their calculation of social distance.   I can go into this more if you like, I'm actually at work now, but I think it's a really interesting and subtle aspect of culture that ""travellers"" will never experience. You actually have to fully join a society to know about it.   And just to be clear there is no moral judgement here, no right / wrong or better / worse.

Please do share your thoughts once you get back from work, because I think this topic is really interesting. (Also I've never been to South America, so I don't know much about the culture of Mexico.)   I mean, yeah the obligations are different in all those cultures - Philippines is generally regarded as very caring and open socially, but 1) this is only reserved for people you know, or people that other people you know know and 2) with the openness comes a handful of social obligations. I feel that because Switzerland has a very structured life (of a first world country), taking care for complete strangers in the streets (not by taking them in, but by calling an expert, etc.,) is easier than Sri Lanka or the Philippines. They don't have time for that shit, they've got stuff to do.  edit: oh, yes, and my point - I forgot that! What I mean to say is that I find the Swiss are a very caring bunch, but depending on region they won't show it to you. It took me fucking ages to come to terms with Swiss-German culture, being from the Lac Léman region. And I'm always confused if I should refer to someone as a friend or not, but then I'll be late for 45 minutes (WHICH IN ZURICH IS AN ABSOLUTE NO GO OH THE HORROR) and they'll patiently wait for me and I'm like: this is a friend.

Your working language for the job will be German (or French or Italian).

One is used to determine the value and the other is used by the tax authority to determine what income-like taxes you owe.  Landwirtschaftlicher Ertragswert is what the tax authority thinks what money you'd make by using the land. Just like the Eigenmietwert, where the tax authority comes up with a theoretical rent income when you own a house.  This value is set by the tax authority - usually set by the Gemeinde (county). (if this is the Ertragswert you're looking for). The property value, when it comes to taxes, is also set by the tax authority. It is often lower than the market value (for houses, that is).

That's also what I've heard from people in the high frequency trading industry. There was a time where a lot of money could be made, but nowadays it basically just pays the bills. Like a team of 6 people making 2000-5000$ on an average day, substract from that capital costs, labor costs, etc and you will probably end with a regular programmers wage (of course there's always some outliers that will make a lot of money)."

Does the in-app purchase method end up bringing in more money than charging for the game and including all the features? I assume the answer is yes since in-app purchases seem to be the popular option nowadays.

Switzerland,2xe0zq,leo_037,4,Sun Mar 1 01:02:05 2015 UTC,"it sounds like a mix of:   tense situations and weak/tired people without the willingness to spend time discussing the problems you perceive. you may or may not be able to change that. a lack of integration (=not blending in) leading to someone saying it's swiss when they actually mean it's how it should be done. I think that in this case, it's swiss stimulates slightly less neurons than it's how it should be done, so you could say you mean ""it's how it should be done?"" and then settle the thing with as many neurons stimulated as can be. the fact that expressing problems is something we might do less openly than Americans on average (you're creating a problem). tip: express problems as distanced and as coldly as possible, hiding your emotions."
Switzerland,2xe0zq,leo_037,13,Sat Feb 28 17:24:43 2015 UTC,"I think we need an example. Rude in what way? Because you're American or also to each other?

But ya I think you're horribly wrong. I'd love to know where in Switzerland you are because I've never heard of anything like that and have lived here basically my whole life. Switzerland is one of the most international countries in the world. We have the UN, ILO, Red Cross, WWF, Davos forums, Basel forums, Geneva conventions/treaties, the football team is half non native swiss. Do you think all of these things would happen in a racist country? Foreigners are part of what Switzerland is.   The people you're talking about are probably the equivalent of rednecks in the US, but in no way is that a majority. That's like if I say every American is a racist asshole cause an arab guy gets checked at the airport"

Switzerland,2xe0zq,pagkatapos,8,Sat Feb 28 23:32:17 2015 UTC,"Well, the proverbial Swiss xenophobia is nothing short of a trademark.  Being Swiss, all I've ever been told growing up was how dreadful and genetically inferior foreigners are ('foreigners' including people from other cantons, of course), while growing up mostly with children who were foreigners, and much more polite, smart and open-minded than the Swiss children.  I think it's a bit of an age thing (chiefly cultivated during and shortly after World War II as part of the so-called Spiritual Defence) and will hopefully mostly be gone in about two generations. Okay, six for central Switzerland. The French-speaking part, as per usual, is much more advanced in this regard."
Switzerland,2xe0zq,nuephelkystikon,14,Fri Feb 27 20:40:22 2015 UTC,genetically inferior foreigners are    Where the hell did you grow up?  The rest sounds reasonable enough.

Talk about beams in one's own eye.  To be fair, the 'natural inferiority' BS is rarely heard even here, but there are still followers of this mindset.  Ironically, somebody in my (Alemannic) family even tried to explain young me multiple times in all seriousness that Germany wouldn't stand a chance against Switzerland in a war because 'their race has the genes of losing', unlike us 'Helvetians'.

Switzerland,2xe0zq,SwissBliss,1 point,Fri Feb 27 22:08:29 2015 UTC,"I have been living here for more than 8 years and I get this too. I realized many Swiss have issues with criticism directed either at them, their canton, their country or anything that has to do directly or indirectly with them. They also have this inability to deal with conflicts of any kind, be it at the workplace, in their relationships with other people, or at decission-making. And they confuse the lack of a spine with ""neutrality"".   But trust me, not all Swiss are like that, they are in the minority. It took me getting the hell out of Zurich city to realize this. I am very happy to live in Switzerland, it's far from perfect but I have come to accept things as they are."

Switzerland,2xc9y2,archerx,7,Fri Feb 27 10:49:16 2015 UTC,"Why do you need to port it to a new engine before release? Seems to work alright as is.  What engine did you use til now? Unreal 3 I assume?  Why not just release what you have (or finish it off if there is more to add) with the old engine and start working on a second installment of the game with new levels in the new engine? If your first game is priced well on steam you should be able to sell enough copies. Then Valve will usually allow subsequent games from the same developer without to much fuss.  It just seems over the top to rip out the engine just before release and redo it all, so I'm a little confused and would like to hear your reasoning.  Edit: I forgot to say anythin about the game at all. So the concept seems cute and the mechanics are interesting, I could see myself buying the game on steam if I found it in the greenlight corner  Edit2: Congrats on the greenlighting!"
Switzerland,2xc9y2,Kazumara,4,Fri Feb 27 12:56:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response and those are very valid questions, yes the original is made with the UDK and I really thought about just exporting a version from there but I realized that taking the time and effort to do a port would give the game and myself a lot of benefits.  Well the none bullshit answer is the licence, with the UDK I would be paying a 25% royalty! However for the unreal engine 4 I got a special licence from Epic because I helped out with the beta of the UE4 that allows me not to pay any royalties on all the games I release before the end of this year. Even if that wasn't the case the royalty on the UE4 is much much lower at 5%!  Other reasons are the UDK is no longer really supported, I want to move on to the newer technology and it will allow me to export a Mac, Linux and Android versions."
Switzerland,2xc9y2,Kazumara,3,Fri Feb 27 14:05:00 2015 UTC,"Concerning licensing: Did you see this: ""Q: If an indie dev makes a successful game and sells a lot of copies. Can they always buy a professional license and avoid the 25% Royalty. (i.e. if it proves cheaper). Or does the UDK use bind the current project to the UDK license terms?  A: Of course, we are happy to discuss full source licenses with you"" in their faq here  And also this: ""If you create a games or commercial applications using UDK for sale or distribution to an end-user or client, or if you are providing services in connection with a UDK based game or application, the per-seat option does not apply. Instead the license terms for this arrangement are US$99 up-front, and a 0% royalty on you or your company’s first US$50,000 in UDK related revenue from all your UDK based games or commercial applications, and a 25% royalty on UDK related revenue from all your UDK based games or commercial applications above US$50,000. UDK related revenue includes, but is not limited to, monies earned from: sales, services, training, advertisements, sponsorships, endorsements, memberships, subscription fees, in-game transactions, rentals and pay-to-play. You or your company will only need one commercial license to cover all the UDK based games or commercial applications you develop."" from here?  I don't know for sure of course but it seems that you might not surpass 50'000 (after valve's cut) on your first game released on steam. And if you do (fingers crossed) you can still get the better one from them.  I can totally understand why you would like to use the latest and greatest UR4 especially because of the platform support. But I still wouldn't let most of what you already have go to waste. I mean what's the problem with releasing what you have and instead investing the work you'd do by porting in a newer version? Do you think you could lose criticle momentum if the first version isn't at its best at release? Or is it that you wouldn't manage to get game number two out the door while you still have the offer for the better terms on UR4  Edit: I hope none of this sounds to much like an attack, it's certainly not supposed to be. I hope you succed whatever way you end up chosing. I'm more or less playing devils advocate to make sure this is really in your best interest and admittedly out of curiousity :)"
Switzerland,2xc9y2,Kazumara,3,Fri Feb 27 15:52:45 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, I don't feel like you're attacking me.  I really thought long and hard about wether or not the doing the port was worth it and in the end I feel like it is for the best.  It's not like I have to do everything from scratch, all the models, textures, sounds, music and other assets are already done so most of it is not going to waste! The main task is just translating the game logic.  I'm going to do a video journal of the process, here is the first one if you're interested in seeing how I'm doing it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIe2OX2LZJU  Are you into game development yourself?"
Switzerland,2xc9y2,Kazumara,2,Fri Feb 27 18:22:46 2015 UTC,"Okay yes that makes sense, I thought the logic was the biggest part but and that leads to your question, I don't have any experience with games nor engines yet. I'm currently studying CS at ETH (first year though).  I like your video, would have never thought it was done like this. Working on top of an engine must be quite a different beast that just programming.  By the way, did you realize that digidistribution.info is down (or more like empty) but still listed on your portfolio?"
Switzerland,2xc9y2,yesat,2,Fri Feb 27 22:38:44 2015 UTC,"Making games is super accessible now and there are so many different engines to choose from as well!

Couldn't tell you how each of them is, though. A 1-year membership seems to cost between CHF 900-1,100.  May I ask on what type of  exchange you're here? If it's for study and you're at a university or a university of higher education, it's possible that you're already an ASVZ member (academic sports association) or can become one quite cheaply (CHF25 per semester). It's for university students and staff, and as a member you can use their gyms (which there are a lot at the different campuses in Zurich, even one in Winterthur I think) and take part in numerous classes and courses for free. http://portal.asvz.ethz.ch/english/Seiten/default.aspx"

Switzerland,2x41w3,heretohelptoday,3,Wed Feb 25 17:35:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not exactly sure what you mean by academic college, but since you're 17 and mentioning ""high school"", I assume you're going a a ""Gymnasium""? Is it the Rychenberg, or the Lee? Enjoy your stay!  If I'm not mistaken, at least the Rychenberg has a small gym as well for the students. And as someone else mentioned, if you're in the last year of secondary school, you could get a 1-year membership in the ASVZ as well, and use their gyms."

The gym itself is alright, kinda what you would expect from MFIT. Lots of machines, not that many free weights, no power cage (although there is a squat rack - albeit with immovable safety rails, too low for me, as I like to squat ATG). The employees are very friendly, though."

Switzerland,2x3mgi,booksworm,3,Thu Feb 26 07:33:45 2015 UTC,Oh true... I guess the textures are different. I suspect that the physical resemblance between the Vlaai and the Hollandertorte alone may explain the name in CH.

With your tax forms you should have gotten a ""Wegeleitung"" which explains the whole tax forms quite well if you are doing it for the first time. You can also look at it online  There are tax advisors that specialize in doing tax returns and will do them for you in 1/2-1 hour for 150-200CHF. Its up to you if you want to spend that money on a tax advisor or rather 1-2 hours of your time doing the return yourself."

It's a good advice to hire a professional for the first time, but maybe for next years you can do it yourself based on this first tax return."
Switzerland,2wzlvl,futurespice,3,Tue Feb 24 14:34:36 2015 UTC,"Would do the same even though I work in audit, should know what to do and have the legal paperwork here.   A tax advisor should be able to advise you when to use real costs vs. lump sums accepted from the tax authorities.   Biggest benefit is that you get a probably good template for the following years. If your income or expenses don't change much you just update the numbers.   Per hour rate should be 100 to 150, typically it's done by a fiduciary and the advisor just reviews the files.  Ask them what files they need, they should give you a list what to prepare."

As far as I know this might not be easy since you are not a Swiss citizen. According to article 8 number 1 SR 514.54 you need a firearm acquisition permit since your handgun is most likely a firearm under article 4. This requires you to prove that you are allowed to acquire such a firearm in your country of residence acc. art 9 numbers 1 and 1bis SR514.54.  Once you have acquired your firearm you'll need to export it, this is regulated by the war material legislation and the cargo control legislation. Finally importing your handgun into the US will require an FFL and an ATF form 6 (methinks), so have fun with that.  For lawyers, I couldn't dig one up on the fly, but keep on searching."
Switzerland,2wvvsr,zilti,2,Mon Feb 23 22:47:00 2015 UTC,"The firearms legislation is national since the register is national.

Switzerland,2wvvsr,Captin_Obvious,2,Mon Feb 23 21:10:50 2015 UTC,For handguns I believe the easiest way is to get a firearms dealer to handle the export for you.

Switzerland,2wunpz,Syndic,1 point,Tue Feb 24 11:31:28 2015 UTC,Hi   Can you explain how to do this? Do you mean while you are in Switzerland you can access US netflix?
Switzerland,2wunpz,micpicci,1 point,Tue Apr 28 08:45:42 2015 UTC,"Yes exactly. For example by using the Hola plugin for Chrome. You can login with the same account and then have access to the US Netflix catalog.  They even greet you with a popup informing you that you have access to other content while you're on ""vacation""."

Switzerland,2wunpz,DavidRappl,3,Tue Feb 24 09:58:34 2015 UTC,"//(Long) rant  I have Netflix for 18 CHF a month (4 people watching at the same time @4K), but then there are series which are HBO exclusive, some are only on Amazon Prime, and others you can not even get on any video streaming service in the EU or US.  So I switched to Plex, setup CouchPotato and SickRage and get every movie and series I want, independent of the publisher. I continue paying for Netflix to feel better, since I only pay for Plex and all other services (Couchpotato and Sickrage) are free. But I will continue watching movies over Plex, even if they are on Netflix, because Plex just does a way better job with its service (design, speed and control).  SwissTV does not cut if for me either - searched Death Parade and got no hits. I know there are a lot of politics involved, but as the consumer, I frankly do not care and just want to watch my favourite TV show / movie, no matter what publisher, service or country."
Switzerland,2wunpz,KingJoffreyTheBaked,4,Mon Feb 23 16:39:36 2015 UTC,"Sadly its kinda expensive. Are the films in german of english? The main reason why i don't have netflix is because its german, so im kinda forced to pirate stuff like legend of korra etc..."
Switzerland,2wunpz,faiaclaah,3,Mon Feb 23 09:08:59 2015 UTC,"all the movies and series are in english (at least if it's a english speaking production of course) ... however, sometimes you'll only have german subtitles."

Switzerland,2wunpz,P1r4nha,2,Mon Feb 23 12:39:13 2015 UTC,I'm looking into getting a Netflix.ch subscription. Do you know how they decide which shows come to the Swiss version? For instance: will the Swiss version also have House of Cards season 3 released next weekend?
Switzerland,2wunpz,CoffeeGrabber,3,Mon Feb 23 14:53:45 2015 UTC,"House of Cards is the exception, they sold the TV rights (at least up to the third season) before they launched in Switzerland so you have to wait for Netflix Content on Netflix until it's been aired on Sky Atlantic (http://www.watson.ch/!661670129).  All their other shows (Marco Polo, Orange is the new black, Arrested Development Season 4, Bojack Horseman and so on) are fully available. And as Better Call Saul demonstrates, they take this commitment seriously, these episodes are available within a few hours of their original airing."
Switzerland,2wunpz,P1r4nha,2,Mon Feb 23 15:56:55 2015 UTC,I guess an American Netflix subscription makes more sense then.
Switzerland,2wunpz,busstopboxer,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:11:16 2015 UTC,"Netflix subscriptions are global, so if you get an account in Switzerland you can connect in the US (or as if you're in the US) and get the US version with all the standard US content."

Switzerland,2wvi1l,cmg62,6,Mon Feb 23 14:54:13 2015 UTC,Don't fly to Venice. Take the train to Milan from Zurich or Lucerne. It'll be awesome.
Switzerland,2wvi1l,frozenbubble,1 point,Mon Feb 23 15:05:32 2015 UTC,I will definitely look into this. Thank you.
Switzerland,2wvi1l,Iylivarae,3,Mon Feb 23 16:44:07 2015 UTC,"It looks o.k.!  But I second the advice that was given before: take the train. If you don't end up going to Zurich, the train from Bern to Milan stops in Thun or Spiez, so youu could go there easily from Interlaken/the Lauterbrunnen area. The trip is actually quite nice, the landscape is beautiful and the train is quite comfortable. Just make sure that you reserve your seats."
Switzerland,2wvi1l,janibus75,2,Mon Feb 23 16:15:16 2015 UTC,I am leaning toward not going to Zurich. Do you have any idea if the swiss pass(for the rail) will take me down south that far? Thank you.
Switzerland,2wvi1l,Iylivarae,2,Mon Feb 23 16:46:01 2015 UTC,Have you looked into interrail for traveling by train? Might be cheaper and it's international. IIRC the swiis pass for the rail will take you at least to the border.
Switzerland,2wvi1l,musiu,2,Mon Feb 23 16:51:02 2015 UTC,I have looked at the interrail but because I am on a tight budget and have only a month and a half I am using a combination of rails and flights.  Which is proving to be way cheaper. I want to explore as much as a can with the time that I have.
Switzerland,2wvi1l,musiu,1 point,Mon Feb 23 17:06:46 2015 UTC,"I think the Swiss Pass will take you to the border, but I don't think it's valid through to Milan. I know that the SBB sometimes have offers to go to Milan on a budget, it might be worth checking into that."
Switzerland,2wvi1l,musiu,2,Mon Feb 23 19:34:22 2015 UTC,"If you don't like cities, don't go to Zurich. You'll have to drive back all the way to bern and then you'll drive north to Zurich (with the train). It will cost you a lot of money and time just to drive everything back.   Idea: spend a little more time in the mountains, you'll like it there! or, if you've seen enough and want a beautiful city, go to Lucerne, much nearer and imho more beautiful than Zurich.   Also, don't fly to venice as an other user already stated. Take the train. The train to Milan is beautiful and cheap if you already use swiss rail.   If you want to couchsurf, write me a pm, I live with 2 other guys (20 years old) right behind the trainstation in Berne. I might be on holidays as well, but maybe it works."
Switzerland,2wvi1l,VitaminCheeese,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:32:22 2015 UTC,"This is actually why I am not sure about going to Zurich. I'm more interested in seeing Switzerland's natural beauty.

Gruyeres is a fun little town but you will see everything in 1 day. Bern is my favorite city, followed by Geneva. I don't care for grindelwald, but I love Lauterbrunnen.   If you are going to Italy after Switzerland, then why not check out souther Switzerland? Ticino. Bellinzona, Lugano and lake como are all beautiful."
Switzerland,2wvi1l,eurocanuk,2,Mon Feb 23 19:46:52 2015 UTC,"If you want to get out of the crowd and see some great mountains, then I'd suggest Zinal. A small vacation town for local swiss people. It's easy to get there on the bus (you can use your swiss rail pass on the bus, I think...)."
Switzerland,2wvi1l,eurocanuk,1 point,Mon Feb 23 19:48:22 2015 UTC,"I would love to spend a lot more time in Switzerland as it is a beautiful country which really fits my active life style. But I am on a budget. I've seen photos of Zermatt and I have decided to save that trip for another day. I plan on coming back to conquer the slopes of switzerland with my snowboard, one day. When that day comes I will probably venture off into southern switzerland.   I had hoped that I could see Gruyeres in a day so I can move on to bern. Good thing you mentioned Grindelwald. I was considering going to one or the other as it is so close together. It seems rather similar. Why do you prefer Lauterbrunnen over Grindelwald?  After thinking it over and taking all these suggestions into account I have decided that I am not going to go to Zurich and take the train to Milan."
Switzerland,2wvi1l,eurocanuk,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:26:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think that Grindelwald or Lauterbrunnen are pretty villages. What makes them special is the view of the mountains. Lauterbrunnen is in a valley, and you actually do have a spectacular view of the mountains, but that's also true for Grindelwald. I personally like Wengen the most (you can take the train there from Lauterbrunnen, and it should be included in the Swiss Pass). There are some amazing views when you take the train up there.  But I think it's totally doable to do Interlaken and the Lauterbrunnen valley  (and Wengen) in one day (it is really quite close to Interlaken), and Interlaken isn't the most spectacular city... there are some hotels, but basically that's it. Use the day you saved to go to Lucerne or something like that."
Switzerland,2wvi1l,eurocanuk,1 point,Tue Feb 24 08:24:53 2015 UTC,"So I have updated my route- Geneva, Gruyeres, Bern, Lauterbrunnen, and Lugano. Though I would like to visit Lucerne, I reall would like to do this within a four day time period. If I cannot I have no choice but to do it within an 8 day time period (due to the swiss card).  I plan for a day in Geneva. A day and a half for Gruyeres and Bern, a day and a half for Lugano. Totaling 4 days in Switzerland. Is this doable?  Thank you for your help."
Switzerland,2wvi1l,eurocanuk,1 point,Tue Feb 24 10:43:29 2015 UTC,"As far as I can see you don't plan any time for Lauterbrunnen?  I think that Gruyeres, Bern and Lauterbrunnen in one and a half days is too much."
Switzerland,2wvi1l,eurocanuk,1 point,Tue Feb 24 11:43:18 2015 UTC,"Ah, you are right! I totally missed Lauterbrunnen. I will be looking at the swiss rail to see which card/ticket will be best for my needs. Thank you."
Switzerland,2wvi1l,eurocanuk,1 point,Tue Feb 24 13:59:41 2015 UTC,"which leads me to one more question. Do you suggest the 8 day Swiss travel pass or would it be cheaper to get a swiss half fare card?  Edit: I just looked at the half fare, and just getting to Gruyeres Via the rail is 115CHF I'll probably be better off using the Swiss travel pass. Though I did see a 6 ticket option."

Honestly you can get away living in Switzerland without a car. You can reach any surrounding country easily by train or bus.   If you want to buy a car and you live in a major city, I would recommend a car like a VW Golf, Audi A3/S3, etc... Which will cost approximately 30-50k CHF used based on the condition and options.  Remember, parking in any major Swiss city sucks and you have to rent a parking spot or get a permit to park on the side of the road.   You can save some additional money if you buy a car imported from Germany but the resale value will also be lower.  You should come to Switzerland without a car and then decide if you need a car."

Switzerland,2wrqe3,lordforkmaster,2,Mon Feb 23 16:27:26 2015 UTC,"Not buying a car   Why wouldn't you buy a car?  The public transportation in Switzerland is getting worse each year and more expensive. Even with Halb-Tax (which is not actually half price in many transportation companies) it's still extremely expensive. Also paying more than 2k each year for a GA is just completely crazy, considering that the trains are always filled with people during the time that you need to go to work and you might not even have a proper seat.  As for the cars in Switzerland, there are plenty of European cars (obviously) around here. People buy lots of Renaults, VW and FIATs for their method of transport to work and they usually buy a bigger car for family trips, while keeping a smaller one for work."
Switzerland,2wrqe3,Lockeylom,1 point,Mon Feb 23 09:26:50 2015 UTC,"Importing your car doesn't make sense, as importing a car from the US into Switzerland costs you around 8-15k because your car is not street legal here (needs at least two stamps...). Buy used, the prices are more attractive than ever, and getting better still.  Depending on your budget, German cars might be worth looking into - they're not as exotic here as in the US."

Switzerland,2wm9je,omHK,2,Sat Feb 21 02:44:12 2015 UTC,"1) Each stage departs/arrives at a place with public transport. That implies an inhabited area. This can be a (small) village, but there is something.  2) There is not relation between camp sites and the Via Alpina. You'll have to look up each place/area up separately. While there are many camping areas in Switzerland, by far not every village or city has one.  3) The weather varies. We had summers with no rain for 3 months and summers with rain two out of three days. You can be miserable and wet in your tent or have the best time of your life. The weather forecast goes about a week ahead, that's the best you'll get.  I'd explore the SAC alpine huts. There are 150 of them and they are geared to the alpine hikers. Going from hut to hut is an excellent option.  Another option are small, local hotels in the mountain towns. They can be quite reasonably priced, 'half-pension' can be a good option (includes supper and breakfast and sometimes even a lunch sandwich). Unfortunately I don't have specific links. Sometimes they have a 'Touristenlager' (simple bedroom for multiple people), which costs less than a room."
Switzerland,2wm9je,markus_b,1 point,Sat Feb 21 21:35:37 2015 UTC,"You're going to really have to be careful about camping. It is generally not legal in Switzerland. Even in secluded areas, they have patrols to find people camping along popular routes. If they find you, you'll (at least) be fined. You'd have a better time staying in cabins/shelters/hostels along the way, but, unfortunately, they typically cost 30 or 40 francs per night."

Switzerland,2wm9je,MyMotherWasAWitch,1 point,Sat Feb 21 11:29:13 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. Sorry, I had never actually bothered looking it up, but I'd heard from so many people that so-called ""wild camping"" (camping outside of designated campgrounds) is strictly forbidden in Switzerland. I've even been told by Swiss people! When doing a biking trip across the country, we ended up asking farmers if we could set up our tent on their property, all to avoid getting fined. But I guess that wasn't necessarily necessary! Thanks for the information, much appreciated :)"
Switzerland,2wm9je,somody,1 point,Sat Feb 21 15:52:05 2015 UTC,"There is not general law against it. But you need the agreement of the owners of the land you want to camp on, otherwise it will be considered as trespassing and you can be fined, chased away, etc. Landowners of places, where wild camping occurs and who disagree with it, certainly will pay attention and chase campers away.  However, in the alps in remote places you can just plant your tent for the night. If you are on an alp, I'd ask the keeper, if there is one. But this does not apply close to inhabited areas, there you can be pretty sure you'll get in trouble."

Switzerland,2wdbr3,Hunts15243,23,Wed Feb 18 23:37:41 2015 UTC,"I am an American and I studied abroad at ETH Zürich from February to August 2014. I personally had the time of my life and would go back in a heartbeat. Breaking down your questions:   transportation around the city   Picking up a used bike is optional in my opinion. You would likely get a monthly tram pass for around CHF 60 that is good for unlimited tram rides during that period. Zurich is very small for a major city so it is easily walkable.   transportation to other countries   Depends on how far you want to go. In some cases it may be cheaper to fly from Basel Euroairport since it is a hub for Ryanair and Easyjet (super budget airlines that fly around Europe). Trains to other countries can get expensive so to help with this, as well as transportation around the country, I would definitely get the Halbtax/Gleis 7 card. It grants you half fare on all SBB rail service within Switzerland as well as discounts on some other modes of transport (occasionally gondolas). Additionally it allows you to ride FOR FREE between the hours of 7 PM - 5 AM. This is an unbelievably valuable deal as you can day trip somewhere, pay half price for the fare there, spend the day and then ride back for free, effectively quartering the cost of transportation from normal fare. It's ~CHF 300 up front but it pays for itself very quickly.   how bad the cost of living really is   There is no sugarcoating it, Switzerland is the most expensive country in the world to live in. You might do a double take when you see that a Whopper combo meal at Burger King is CHF 7,00. I was lucky in that ETH gave me a stipend to subsidize my rent at a WOKO (basically student housing but off campus) for CHF 495 / month. If you're thinking of studying at Universität Zürich, they have what are called Mensas, which are cafeterias with heavily subsidized meals that work out to CHF 7-10 depending on what you get. I cooked most of my own meals at home. Groceries are generally affordable and comparable in price to American grocery stores with some exceptions. Also Migros will often have a great takeaway section with relatively cheap, quality food if you don't feel like cooking.    how the nightlife/social scene is for people my age   To be honest, not that great. Zürich is no Berlin when it comes to opportunities for youth nightlife. There are a few clubs around (Plaza and Hive come to mind) and some really great bars, all with the caveat of being really expensive. Most of my nightlife consisted of hanging out with my fellow international friends and having house parties or just chilling with some booze, if we weren't traveling somewhere. If you are looking to party every night, Zürich is not your city - but there are enough opportunities here that you won't feel completely starved if that is your thing. If you're going at the beginning of fall when it's still warm then Zürichers will still be having tons of barbecues out on the lake and around the city's beautiful parks and forests. With Zürich, think less raging parties, more chill.   the weather for that time of year (august-december)   I can't speak for beyond august but that month was wonderful. It's warm but not hot, enough to walk around in a tank top and shorts. There's plenty of sunlight for the most part. I would bet it starts getting colder late October.    options for hiking/scenic/outdoor activities   Holy shit way too many. This is where Switzerland in my opinion beats out almost all other places in the world for having such amazing outdoor activities that are easily accessible by public transport. For the first couple of months you absolutely need to go hiking around Mount Rigi, Mount Pilatus, Zermatt, Lauterbrunnen and the Creux du Van (and many more I could name). Once it starts snowing a decent amount you should go skiing even if you're a beginner. I skiied at Davos, Arosa/Lenzerheide and Zermatt and had some of the best runs of my life, and I have skiied in Colorado and Utah. There's nothing like a perfect powder day in bright sunlight at 3000 meters.   the swiss' friendliness towards Americans   All the Swiss people I met were generally very friendly. Compared to Americans or Australians they are more reserved, and generally have well-established Swiss friend groups. However one thing that will absolutely help you in breaking the ice is if you decide to try learning Swiss German. Everyone will be willing to help you as I think language is one of the biggest barriers of intimacy between the Swiss and other nationalities. Regular German is good too although many Swiss people prefer not to use it when possible. Practically everyone I met spoke English so you won't have trouble communicating. Even after those 6 months I made one truly good Swiss friend, and she is one of the nicest, funnest and most caring people I've ever met. However I made a ton of international friends since the two big universities in Zürich (ETH and UZH) have a large contingent of international students who study there from all over the world.   I could keep talking about Switzerland forever so definitely PM me if you want to know more about my experience and advice on stuff to do. Again, I personally loved my time there and wouldn't trade it for anything else."

You can literally cross most of it in one hour on foot.   transportation to other countries   Trains. The tickets ain't cheap. Nothing is.   how bad the cost of living really is,   Lunch at Uni: $6, rent for 1 room: $600, health insurance per month: $200. Expect $1500 monthly expenses.   how the nightlife/social scene is for people my age   Great. Drinking age is 18, Zürich has a decent clubbing scene afaik (I'm too old to know)   the weather for that time of year (august-december)   Bring a winter coat, sweaters and and an umbrella or five. Probably no snow yet.   options for hiking/scenic/outdoor activities (obviously there's a lot but what specifically),    Way too much to be specific. I'll recommend visiting a castle (loads nearby), go to Mürren or Adelboden for a week-end (bring good hiking shoes), visit Luzern or Basel or Bern to see a pretty city, and have a swim in the lake while it's warmish.   and the swiss' friendliness towards Americans?

I am starting to try and learn German since I have always wanted to and it would definitely help but I don't think I will learn enough in a few months to actually be able to use it everyday to a great extension.    Just to make sure you're aware of this: Swiss people usually write in German but their spoken languages are a wide range of Swiss-German dialects that are almost beyond comprehension even for native Germans. So even if you know German perfectly well, you will have some troubles using it in everyday situations.

In french- or italian-speaking areas you will be better off with English (that's what I do, even though I had French in school). So German is a huge plus for employers, much more than English. For everyday life, English will be enough everywhere you go. People not speaking English are a rare exception here.  My main point is this: You can't learn proper German or improve your German skills in Switzerland by talking to locals. How we speak is profoundly different from how we write and even if you get some locals to constantly speak in proper German to you, it's going to be buried under a thick accent."

So while you can't buy a Swiss car, for example, you will find parts made in Switzerland in almost any car.  Switzerland doesn't have any natural resources worth speaking of, but it does have a long list of successful companies, take a look at http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Swiss_companies_by_revenue and see how many you recognise. Nestlé with all sorts of food and chocolate. Roche, Novartis, and a couple more big pharmaceutical companies, ABB is a huge engineering company, Hilti is one of the biggest tool companies in the world, Schindler produces elevators, Logitech produces keyboards and mice and other computer peripherals. Then there's Swatch and the zillion other watch companies. And a whole host of companies that produce chocolate and similar luxury items.  Banking and financial services are another big thing for Switzerland, it alone is about 10% of GDP, but even without that, Switzerland would still be pretty well-off.  Another big factor is of course that they did not get involved in any of the world wars. No war debt to pay off, no expensive reconstruction efforts.

(1)   low taxes for companies allowing tax competition between communes and cantons sane IP regulation (strict patent system, no software patents, letting patents expire relatively quickly, see Nespresso) sane industry regulations. E.g. you can do things like selling raw milk cheese if declared properly, selling cucumbers that aren't straight (looking at you, EU), selling unlabeled products at the farmer's market, selling generic medicine.   (2)   regulations for renting property - quitting a contract needs 3 month notice on both sides.  regulations in favour of employees - mandatory vacation, maternal leave, protection when becoming sick & needing to do military service - but generally more liberal than France/Germany where firing someone can become almost impossible -> allows the job markets to flow more freely.   So, having a truly 'liberal' system doesn't just mean to be friendly to companies - regulations should generally be as few as possible, but if regulating anything it needs to be protecting the weaker party in a transaction and it should if possible not shut down the market and hand the keys to an oligopoly (see IP law in the US, pharmaceutical industry in the US, telecommunication industry in the US). Switzerland is doing pretty well there - although that could be just a factor of scale, since it's just a better return on investment for companies like Novartis to let the lobbying millions flow in the US rather than in Switzerland."

When you are able to pay your health insurance, rent a decent apartment etc. Then your kids grow up to become productive members of the society, which leads to a chain reaction of being able to consume goods, less crime, cleaner cities and so on. Here the extremes between poor and rich are huge, and are getting bigger. I just hope that it won't happen in Switzerland."

I work in manufacturing, which is about a quarter of the economy, And we have taken some serious body blows with recent shifts in the currency market, and the fallout remains to be seen. While the luxury watch market will probably survive, the rest of us will suffer.   The last bit is that it is a small country, both in size and population. They don't need a whole lot of the money hidden here to leak in to keep things going. They can leave a lot of their problems over the border, too."

Cheaper rent would be in Fribourg I guess, and the city is quite nice and quiet. Lausanne is almost as expensive as Geneva now, but the culture, night life and situation is far better IMO. I don't know how much are the rent in Bern. I commute in about 1:15, 1:30 per way, the direct train is great but if you have to change 1 or 2 times for regiotrains and buses it can become a nightmare with trains missed and time wasted whike waiting for the next transport. If only one of you have to commute thre other one should accept to do more cleaning and prepare meals at the eveneing to have a fair compensation, if you're both commuting you will both arrive late and exhausted at home and you will not have much time to cook and spend time together.   If you've search some times without luck and you are desperate to get a flat, they are some ~~theft ~~ advisors that will get you the flat you are looking for in exhange for 1.5 time the price a month of rent. They are like a small mafia with inside contacts to get out flats that are not proposed on tye free market,  it's you choose if you want to pay the price and help these kind of people for not spent all your time and energy on the search (and it could last months before you get something that doesn't necessary mach exactly what you are looking for).

Switzerland,2vrfqm,SwissBliss,3,Fri Feb 13 13:08:40 2015 UTC,"I'm going to put a NO in.  I think here in this case, the con's outweighs the pro's:   CON: tax losses for the country CON: richer families benefit PRO: poorer families benefit (but not really much)   So, I think it's not worth the tax loss to lower the tax burden of wealthier families."
Switzerland,2vrfqm,your_local_redditor,7,Sun Feb 15 17:42:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I got this right but because of the tax-progression the rich would benefit more from this, right?  I try to clarify this with a little calculation:  Let's say a rich person earns 20'000.- a month with 10% income tax So he has to pay 2000.- Now the child aids become tax-free His income now is 19550.- and because of the tax-Progression he only has to pay 9,5% taxes. So he only pays 1857,25.-  Now we apply the same formula to a poor person This person earns 2000.- a month with 1% income tax He has to pay 20.- Without the child aid he only has 1550.- taxable income and he gets taxed with a rate of 0,75% which is 11,625.- in his case.  So the rich person saves 142,75.- or 0,71375% of his income. The poor person saves 8,375.- which is 0.41875% of his income so the poor person saves less than the rich.  I know it's very simplified but that was my immediate thought when I read the dossier."
Switzerland,2vrfqm,FunkyFreshJayPi,8,Fri Feb 13 14:57:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's right, it's even one of the Federal Council's arguments against this.  Also the reason why I'll vote against it; if helping poor families is needed, giving more money to the richer ones is definitely not the way to do it."
Switzerland,2vrfqm,Aethec,6,Fri Feb 13 15:34:43 2015 UTC,"giving more money to the richer ones   I don't particularly like this kind of thinking as it turns everything upside down. This is not giving more money to the richer ones, it is taking away less from them. There's a profound difference. Not every single financial measure has to be part of a wealth re-distribution program. Also, don't forget that tax progression itself is already wealth re-distribution (And don't get me wrong, I fully support it), so you can't take that for granted and then argue that this measure would benefit the richer ones more as if it was a gift...  That being said, I'll vote no because I don't think we need more special this and special that for everything."
Switzerland,2vrfqm,buyacasha,3,Fri Feb 13 16:11:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not really ""giving"", but the result is that the richer the family, the more money they'll have thanks to this initiative."

Switzerland,2vrelt,SwissBliss,10,Fri Feb 13 12:53:19 2015 UTC,"It's a joke, by design, although I'm not sure if that's voluntary.    The official goal of this tax is to replace the VAT. This means the new tax will need to be really high, because the VAT is a huge source of revenue for the government. And the higher the tax, the less people will use non-renewable energies, so the tax needs to be even higher... and so on and so forth.  Since there's no tax on renewable energies, if the end goal - eliminate or drastically reduce the use of non-renewable energy - is reached, the federal government will have lost a massive part of its income.  Now, for the subjective part, I have two theories: either the Green Liberals are just as idealistic (to put it nicely) as the Greens, and they seriously think this is a good idea, or they're really liberals who use ""Green"" as a disguise, and they want the government to get less money since, well, that's the goal of liberals.  (and then there's also the debate about nuclear power; to me it seems silly to lump coal and nuclear together as ""bad stuff"" when the ""good stuff"" isn't ready yet)"
Switzerland,2vrelt,Aethec,4,Fri Feb 13 15:40:48 2015 UTC,"Fully agree, I'll vote no as well.   either the Green Liberals are just as idealistic (to put it nicely) as the Greens, and they seriously think this is a good idea, or they're really liberals who use ""Green"" as a disguise, and they want the government to get less money since, well, that's the goal of liberals.   Well, since liberals generally like to see free market at play, I somehow don't see them massively taxing non-renewable energy. I'll go with the former. :)"
Switzerland,2vrelt,buyacasha,2,Fri Feb 13 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"One of the arguments against it is, that the energy tax would hurt poor people more than the VAT does. I don't really know if that is true, but it's one of the first ones made by the Bundesrat.  AFAIK there is not a direct correlation between energy consumption and income, so that may very well be true, that rich people can easily save money with this tax, but a certain baseline will always be necessary, which will disproportionately hurt the poorer folks."

It doesn't sound like you're after freeriding terrain, so honestly any of the areas you mentioned will be awesome for you. They all have pretty damn spectacular views. They are also all quite close together, and it's easy to move between them. If you're a decent rider you absolutely don't have to worry about things like having to walk out of flats—it's not gonna happen.  How/why did you narrow your choice to the Jungfrau region? How much time do you have?   Source: Me. This is my 20th consecutive season of snowboarding, and I think 8th in Switzerland. This is my life's biggest passion."
Switzerland,2vs3i1,batwingsuit,1 point,Fri Feb 13 18:46:41 2015 UTC,"No offense taken. Thanks for the reply!   I guess intermediate/advanced was a little too optimistic. Things like steepness and length aren't really an issue. I was more worried about the flats and narrowness of some slopes, but seems like you've answered my question.  I chose the Jungfrau region since my itinerary is pretty short (only 1 week in the country) and I could afford to spend extra time around the Interlaken/Jungfrau region since it's relatively close to Zurich. If you have any other recommendations  or insight I'm all ears. Thanks again!"

Just keep in mind that trains are very expensive in Switzerland. You can get a better idea of times and price on the SBB website. A Swiss-Pass might be a good idea if you want to get around during that week.  Now, back to your question. I would say based on your description of what you're looking for, Mürren is the place you want to go out of those three. The views and location are awesome. You start by taking a cable car from the valley up over a giant cliff wall into the village of Mürren. Then you change onto another cable car and go way up to the Schilthorn"

Most of the time we were up at kleine scheidegg. Just a train ride up the mountain. Lift lines were pretty steady didnt have to wait around much at all. Not sure what its like now though. Im jealous.

The Austrians exploded with laughter after they heard about the useless bridge in the field. They laughed and laughed until their bellies hurt. After about 3 months the Austrians said to the Swiss: ""Man you guys really did a fantastic job on that bridge. That's the stupidest thing we've ever seen, but it's been 3 months and we've laughed enough. You can break the bridge down now if you want"".

The front didn't move anymore and the troops of both armys were sitting in the trenches, occasionaly popping out of cover to try to shoot an enemy. After months and months without progress a Swiss had an ingenious idea: ""Let's just call for Franzl, those Austrians are all called Franzl"". So they'd shout: ""Franzl?"" which would surprise the simple-minded Austrians who'd stand up and ask back: ""Jo mei, was is denn?"" (""What's going on"") The Swiss used that moment to shoot them in the head. After doing this for some weeks progress was showing and the casualties on the Austrian side were much bigger than on the Swiss side, but slowly the Austrians began to learn: They now copied the technique of luring the enemy out of cover and would shout ""Sepp?"" but nothing happened. They tried again: ""Sepp?"", but still no Swiss to shoot in sight. Now they tried one last time: ""Sepp!!?"" But smart as the Swiss are they just said ""Joa Franzl, bist des du?""

Because Switzerland is doing very well relative to the surrounding countries, immigration and growth is disproportionately higher than usual.  The article says they would adapt the quotas according to the needs of the economy. The thing is, that if the economy growths the quotas will hinder it.. if the economy stagnates the quotas won't be a problem. So I think the plan is to hope for the economy to suffer, lower the quotas and make them higher again (because the economy needs it) or something. On average the quotas are then still applied properly.  The IT businesses will have to recruit from the untrained domestic workforce and train them themselves, which will be very costly."

The typical German doesn't do that. They just say what they want. They don't mean it rude or something like that, but the typical swiss person thinks it's rude.

The Swiss have a ""guess"" culture (http://www.thewire.com/national/2010/05/askers-vs-guessers/19730/) - you ""dress up"" your requests in nice words, you avoid conflict situations etc. Germans on the other hand are generally direct and up front. I think this can make Swiss people feel uncomfortable, maybe in a subtle way so that they don't necessarily see it as a product of differing ways of communicating.   People come up with other explanations (the ""big"" stuff) because its hard to place an uncomfortable feeling, but I think it really comes down to these communication differences since they subtly but powerfully condition how you see people."

People from the Bodensee region and Schwarzwald seem extremely friendly, certainly more than most Swiss IMO. But go all the way up to Hamburg and the experience is quite different. Buying something in a supermarket there was quite unpleasant for me. The German being used there is actually different enough that I had some troubles communicating, and people more often than not just couldn't understand how that could happen to a 'native' German speaker - they seem to think everyone just talks like them, so there is no slowing down, no meeting halfway, just straight up tell me what you want or get out.  I think this also lends to some of the problems some Germans have with integrating in Switzerland - as an example we had a new German doctor in my hometown that my grandparents just couldn't accept because he would talk so fast they wouldn't understand a word. From what I know he was soon gone."

Imagine the Book market without Germany ? How many Books would be translated/printed just for the Swiss (6 Mio souls ?). The same goes for many other areas of life.

Maybe I can add another one: Germany is pretty much the leader of the EU (at least it is often perceived as such) and many Swiss are very critical of the EU, more so these days than maybe 5 or so years ago. So it's easy to make the association that EU = Germany.  This intolerance is a saddening to me, because we don't differ that much to be honest, but the error isn't just with these Swiss people. A number of German immigrants act as if we don't differ at all and Swiss people are proud of their uniqueness. So a German who seems unaware or ignores these differences will have a bad time.

Every moring in the winter they had to go and check if there was ice over the Bodensee and if so they destroyed it. So the Germans could not just walk over.  I remember her talking bad about neighbors who had German girlfriends or wives. And it was normal in our family to dislike Germans. My mum taught me better.

Dabei schränkte man die Zahl der Bewerber auf sechs bis acht ein. Wegen der hohen Antrittskosten kamen für ein Amt nur Angehörigebegüterter Fam. in Frage.""

I've read similar stuff about Basel: to have any chance to get the job of mayor you had to be in the ""Grosse Rat"" (meaning: Great Council) not a club anybody could join or be elected into.

This means that the danger of aristocrats arranging the election and therefore the need for sortition could have been lessened.  Also, especially in rural regions, political offices were probably unpaid in that time, albeit they required quite some time investment. The working class just could not afford to be absent from work and therefore had to turn down the office if elected by sortition. It was probably easier to vote for people who would actually accept the election.  I recommend that you ask in /r/AskHistorians  if you did not already."

So maybe you think you were taught to man the fuck up, but I'm prettty sure in daycare your teacher patted you on the head. I mean grade 3, yeah, that's the time you get it disinfected and bandaged up and left alone to suck it up. (Also I was surprised to find out that kids are scared as fuck that disinfectant hurts. Now that's stupid.) But daycare? Don't think so.  Homoeopathic stuff is easy for daycare workers: makes the kids think they're being taken seriously, stops them from whining because the ""problem"" is solved, soothes their anxiousness and helps them with waiting... cue quiet kids, happy parents.  TBH it's important that kids get their cuts disinfected. And unlike what we (me at least, and I'm assuming you) were taught putting cream on a wound actually helps the healing process (and prevents scar tissue). I used to think scabbing was part of the healing process, but according to modern medicine that's not good.  ALSO Disclaimer: I don't have kids, don't work with kids (for a reasssson), I'm not a fan for homoeopathic remedies for myself as an adult -  there's a time and place for everything.

Eucalyptus, sold as a natural decongestant does work by opening up airways. Ginger and Sage teas, the latter sold as class D medication, do also sooth stomach and digestive problems. Salt water mouth washes, kill bacteria and sea salt nose sprays can unblock your sinuses.   Homeopathy is by its very definition none of the above, and generally not as advertised (although sometimes available) in pharmacies, although your health insurance may indeed subsidize homeopathic / natural treatments.   That said, the way natural treatments are pushed in Switzerland makes me cringe, the fact that there are herbs and plants sold as ""medicine"" also makes me feel uncomfortable. Not just because of the high prices of throat soothing cough sweets but also because it breeds miss-information where even pharmacists will dangerously push natural stuff instead of suggesting the person visits a medical professional.   I think it says a lot about the state of Pharmacies in Switzerland (why can't simple medicine like aspirin, ibuprofen, etc be sold in supermarkets) and the hold they have over the general layperson's understanding of medicine here in Switzerland.  I have no problem with Ricola being sold as a natural way to soothe a sore throat in a pharmacy, but I do have a problem with a industry blocking access to basic medicine in favour of pushing high-markup sweets."

Of course it's not treating the cause of the pain, the stress or the swelling, but even a lot of actual medicine only treats the symptoms and not the cause of an ailment anyway.

Based on this, I did a little math. Under a majority vote by canton, the National Council would have looked like this:   Party: Seats (% of popular vote, % of seats) SVP/UDC: 122 (26.6%, 61%) SP/PS: 41 (18.7%, 20.5%) CVP/PDC: 20 (12.3%, 10%) FDP/PLR: 16 (15.1%, 8%) BDP/PBD: 1 (5.4%, 0.5%)   Whereas under proportional representation, it looked like this:   Party: Seats (% of popular vote, % of seats) SVP/UDC: 53 (26.6%, 26.5%) SP/PS: 46 (18.7%, 23%) FDP/PLR: 30 (15.1%, 15%) CVP/PDC: 28 (12.3%, 14%) BDP/PBD: 9 (5.4%, 4.5%)   Plus parties that wouldn't have received seats under majority voting:   Party: Seats (% of popular vote, % of seats) GPS/PES: 15 (8.4%, 7.5%) GLP/PVL: 12 (5.4%, 6%) EVP/PES: 2 (2%, 1%) Lega: 2 (0.8%, 1%) CSP/PSC: 1 (0.4%, 0.5%) MCG: 1 (0.4%, 0.5%)   While proportional representation favors some parties disproportionally, overall it's still more ""just"" than majority vote. Interestingly, the only party to be over-represented under both systems are the socialists.  So yeah, majority vote vs. proportional representation makes quite a difference."

Have a look at organic milk: Dairy cows sometimes get mastitis, which is a very painful inflammation of their udders. In a conventional or IP-Suisse cow, you would treat that with antibiotics and probably painkillers to make the cow more comfortable. With an organic cow, you're required to give the cow useless homeopathics first, which means prolonged suffering, before you're actually allowed to treat its pain.

Homeopathy isn't so funny when patients are advised to not vaccinate their children, or stop their cancer treatment in favor of sugar pills.  There's also the cost factor: because of an initiative, health insurance has to cover some alternative medicine, so we're all paying for fake medicine.  There's another form of slippery slope, too: if you tell people ""sure, take your homeopathy, maybe it works for you"" even though homeopathy is contrary to all scientific principles, you risk people thinking ""maybe science is wrong"".

And apparently with homeopathy it worked for them. So I keep hearing people getting cured so I decided to try it out, doesn't hurt (paying out of my own pocket).

First of all: As /u/mertbas0 said, it's all illegal, use and possession (below 10g) are usually just mild fines, no record, not court.  Now, I live in Winterthur and this is based on my particular life, so this may or may not apply to you, but my experience is: Nobody gives a shit.   I've had police officers walk by me while I was smoking pot and they didn't lift a finger. Apparently the police are actually for the legalisation of weed because they say it's not worth the hassle (and stoners are rather peaceful I guess).   It's absolutely socially acceptable, I will usually ask whether anyone minds me smocking pot and only get shaking heads and maybe even a few people joining in. At my workplace everyone knows I'm smocking weed (admittedly, it's a small company with around 50 employees, not a big bank or something) and nobody minds, it's actually kind of a running gag.  As for growing: I used to grow it in the garden and I just asked my neighbours if they mind, they said no, end of story. As long as you're not planning to grow fifty plants. Actually had police officers come by my house twice in that time (nothing to do with me) and they had to walk straight past the plants to enter and nothing ever happened.  Of course, it could be that I've just been incredibly lucky, but I doubt it. Almost everyone I've asked has smocked weed once in their lives, I like to think that it's illegal because legalisation would damage the image of bureaucracy and boringness we cultivate so lovingly ;)  If you have questions, will check the account sometime tomorrow..."

It's funny how laws can be so similar on paper (in the state that I live in simple possession of pot is the legal equivalent of a parking ticket and no longer a criminal offense) but real life implementation can be so different.   Around here if the cops learned you were growing even a few plants they'd probably kick down your door, haul you to jail and shoot your dog for good measure. The anti-US police circlejerk on Reddit can be a bit much but when you see how more civilized law enforcement behaves you sort of understand the cop haters."

Switzerland,2vamyk,weeeaaa,6,Mon Feb 9 19:48:50 2015 UTC,"I completely understand that you're reserved but after having done that at least 50 times during the last two years I've come to the conclusion that it's actually much more safe than buying on the streets. Here's why:  There are two risks associated with buying illicit drugs: Being caught by law enforcement and being sold a shitty-to-dangerous product. Let us consider the former first: When buying on the streets there's danger being caught with the product during the deal or afterwards. During the deal you have to fear undercover police and on the way home the smell or a ""random"" check could give it away. In either case you're caught red-handed without any excuse. Now enter darknet markets: The police has to proof that you actually ordered the weed, simply intercepting the package won't buy them anything. What they need is your confession or hard evidence, otherwise I could send you drugs and report it to the police and you would be effed. If you keep your mouth shut and keep all your data on encrypted devices with plausible deniability then you're safe from that scenario even if they force you by court to reveal your passwords. Furthermore those DarknetMarkets have customer reviews for dealers and in general are very reputation-centered. The only way an undercover cop could bust you in this way is them secretly taking over an already established vendor and sending you drugs and that's illegal, they won't do that.  EDIT: Also think about what image such an operation would give: Police spends hundreds of hours on specialists for tracking down a Tor user and decrypting his data just to fine him 100 CHF for ordering 10g of weed? That story is going to be on the front-page of left-wing journals and will almost surely start a public debate. They're not going to risk that for a 100.- fine. Furthermore ordering over the internet isn't more illegal than buying on the streets, the down-sides are the same, it's just much more difficult for the police to nail you against the wall.  The risk of being sold an inferior product is also greater on the streets: Since weed is an ""experience good"" you can only judge its quality by consuming it or by the reputation of the vendor. But street vendors can't build up reputation for obvious reasons. Online vendors usually have hundreds of customer reviews if they are legitimate and if something goes wrong you can file a complaint at the market place (and get your money back) and leave negative reviews. If you're a scammer then going online with your ""drugs"" is the last thing you should do because you will be banned soon enough and your profits will be locked in the escrow of an anonymous online platform.  An additional point: It's so fucking convenient. Ordering weed takes my 5 minutes max. and I don't even have to leave the house for it. Delivery is usually 1-2 days.  That being said: Ordering from Darknet-Markets isn't for naive fools. You will have to dive into Tor, Tails, Bitcoin, Bitcoin money laundering, PGP and encryption technologies like Truecrypt (this has the nice side effect that you usually don't see a lot of idiots on these market places, the entry-barriers are just too high). That will take you at least a week to fully understand what you're doing and why it's going to save your ass when things go sideways. Also, if the police shows up on your door with such a package, you're better prepared for that (you know your rights and you keep your mouth shut, no matter what). This isn't a game for naive optimists that just hope that things will be ok, paranoia is considered a healthy trait in this business.  So if you don't know what you're doing stay far away from the darknet. However, if you're willing to put some time into this and understanding the process thoroughly then I would claim that there's no safer/more convenient way to get drugs in Switzerland. I'm willing to pay 10.- or more (in bitcoins of course, always stay safe) to anyone who can convince me that there's better a way (seriously, if there is one, tell me now!!)."

I can't exclude the possibility that the federal supreme court makes a judicial precedent of the first case, so I'd rather not be that first case.  It also looks way better to simply hand over (after having refused profusely) a password that unlocks a stash of gay SM porn (but not your other data) instead of simply refusing to cooperate.

Switzerland,2vamyk,lhatchy1,1 point,Thu Feb 12 10:47:43 2015 UTC,"Yes. You order it to your house, not to a post box where you have to get it under camera surveillance. Also make sure the address you're ordering to is actually valid and gets used for a lot of legitimate mail too, it looks suspicious to a computer otherwise.  If you order from Swiss-Shop you'll get a normal weed bag vacuum sealed into a static shield bag inside one of those envelopes. So it will look and feel like an order from an electronics shop as long as you don't open it.  The hard part is ordering without leaving any traces of your personal information such that you can receive the package with a surprised look on your face without the police being able to prove that you knew about it."
Switzerland,2vamyk,msimsi,1 point,Thu Feb 12 16:54:29 2015 UTC,"By personal info you mean my name on the envelope, or information regarding the order and how it was made? I'm assuming the latter but just want the clarification! Thanks"
Switzerland,2vamyk,throwthisshit3,2,Thu Feb 12 23:35:35 2015 UTC,"There are 3 things you should keep in mind:   Only the dealer should be able to see your delivery address (which most likely is your real name). Since you use a darknet market for having conflict resolution and escrow, you must encrypt your address with PGP before entering the information. You don't want your address popping up in a server log should the police ever seize the market place (or worse, take it over secretly). Use Tor or TAILS to hide your IP and your online identity from online surveillance. If the police busts your dealer and finds your address on an unshipped package they better not find a log entry from your ISP (or NSA database for that matter, happened before) that says you connected to a darknet market during the last week. For the same reason you have to anonymize your Bitcoin payments. Every transaction in Bitcoin is totally in the open and can be traced back for all eternity. You can buy Bitcoins from an online exchange but they usually ask for IDs, utility bills and the fingerprints of your firstborn before they let you trade. Therefore you have to obfuscate that trail, otherwise the police could just trace back a payment from a busted dealers wallet until they hit a wallet of an exchange and ask whose account was responsible for that payment. This is always a little tricky because you will have to trust some shady anonymous bitcoin mixing service with your coins to get complete untraceability. I recommend bitmixer.io, they at least give you a cryptographically secured certificate for each deal that would ultimatively prove to anyone that they're stealing if they really screw you over."

Es sei denn die USA sagen es den Schweizern nochmal deutlicher.    Seit 45 hören wir Schweizer denselben unqualifizierten Bullshit den du gerade von dir gegeben hast. Irgendwann wird man immun gegen diese unsachlichen politischen Machtkämpfe.  EDIT: Ausserdem hast du die Frage nicht beantwortet bezüglich welche Nennung der Schweiz im Artikel dich dazu veranlasst die Schweiz dafür verantwortlich zu machen. Offenbar ist dir, wie auch den EU/US Politiker, jede Gelegenheit zum Schweiz-Bashing recht."

Switzerland,2vaalz,Wh1sperw1nd,3,Tue Feb 10 04:47:57 2015 UTC,"Gelogen. Ich stelle keine Behauptung auf - du bist nur zu dumm zum lesen. Die Headline verkürzt nur die Copy des Artikels und ist KEINE BEHAUPTUNG DIE ICH AUFGESTELLT HABE.   Erstens hat der Artikel diese Behauptung nicht gemacht, das hast du da reingelesen und zweitens ist das komplette Haarspalterei: Nur weil jemand vor dir das gleiche behauptet kannst du dich nicht einfach der Verantwortung entziehen und einfach nachplappern ohne Begründungen zu liefern. Ansonsten könnte jeder Neo-Nazi einfach auf ""Mein Kampf"" verweisen.   Tausende Dokumente, die NDR, WDR und SZ ausgewertet haben, zeigen nun Details der Bankgeschäfte, bei denen es darum ging, Geldanlagen in der Schweiz zu verschleiern.   Ich bleib dabei, wenn du aus diesem Sachverhalt kausal schlussfolgerst das der Schweizer Staat Schuld daran hat, ohne irgendwelche Zwischenschritte, dann bist du der Grundlagen der Logik oder der Deutschen Sprache nicht mächtig. Hättest du eine sachlich fundierte Meinung dazu könntest du diese hier auch formulieren, stattdessen weigerst du dich auch nur eine einzige Schlussfolgerung deines Gedankenkonstrukts zu erörtern, weshalb wohl?   Den initialer Kommentar, bevor irgendwer zu Wort gekommen ist, enthält auch kein Argument. Und im Verlauf der Diskussion willst du auch trotz mehrfacher Nachfrage nicht beantworten, wieso die Schweiz denn absolut keine Schuld träfe.   Du hast offenbar etwas an den Ohren. Diese Aussage war ein reines Gedankenkonstrukt um dir die Sturheit deines eigenen Vorgehens vor Augen zu führen. Ich habe diese Behauptung nicht gemacht und werde sie auch nie machen. Was ich allerdings verlange ist dass mein Diskussionspartner erklärt wie er zu seinen Schlussfolgerungen gekommen ist und nicht einfach nur unqualifizierte Behauptungen aufstellt und dann von anderen Leuten erwartet dass diese ihn widerlegen, ganz egal wie vage und ungenau seine Behauptungen waren. Man könnte beispielsweise argumentieren wie ganz bestimmte Geschäftspraktiken den Steuerhinterzug vereinfachen, dann könnte man aufzeigen welche konreten rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen in der Schweiz solche Praktiken bevorzugen und dann könnte man argumentieren dass die Schweiz bisher zu wenig unternommen hat um das Problem zu lösen. Du hingegen bleibst bei ""Schweiz ist Schuld"" und verweist auf einen Artikel der die Sache eigentlich nur am Rande berührt und hast das Gefühl das wäre ne vernünftige Argumentation.   DU hast doch als erster etwas (Antworten) gefordert. Das ist dann nicht hemmungslos, weil die Schweiz so toll ist oder wie ist das auszulegen?   Ich habe lediglich Erklärungen für Behauptungen gefordert die einfach so in den Raum gestellt worden sind. Zu keinem Zeitpunkt bin ich tatsächlich in die Diskussion eingestiegen ob die Schweiz irgendwelche Schuld trifft, einzig deswegen weil die Voraussetzungen für eine vernünftige Diskussion noch nicht gegeben sind: Wer was behauptet der hat es zu begründen. Wenn du damit nicht einverstanden bist dann sag's und wir beenden das hier sofort.  Dass dich das irritiert hat nur damit zu tun dass du jede meiner Äusserungen als Contra-Argument zu deiner Meinung interpretierst. Jede meiner Äusserungen bezieht sich ausschliesslich darauf dass deine Meinung, oder zumindest die Art wie sie präsentiert wird, schlicht nicht diskussionstauglich ist und ich werde hier sicher nicht ein wohlüberlegtes Argument produzieren solange du nicht den kleinsten Mehraufwand in Kauf nimmst um deinen Beitrag zu einer fruchtbaren Diskussion zu liefern. Wie bereits gesagt, der Unterschied zwischen Diskutieren und Predigen scheint dir nicht geläufig.   Zusammenhangslos schreibst du wirres Zeug an /u/painintheass21 und nennst es Sarkasmus (/s).   Eben, wirres Zeugs. Ich muss nur deine Aussagen umformulieren, den Inhalt identisch lassen und schon wird ""wirres Zeugs"" draus. Du kannst jetzt gerne behaupten dass du das nie gesagt hast, musst dann aber auch einsehen dass du dann gar nichts gesagt hast und folglich jede sachliche Antwort auf deinen Post ins Leere läuft.

There are still plenty of cinemas that show them in original language, while having German an French subtitles.   On TV they are primary in German, but often you can switch the audio channel to original language. Whatever that might be.   Sidenote: 10 and more years ago, the TV shows were way better dubbed than today. They spent more time before broadcasting. E.g. Married with children is pretty well done.

Switzerland,2ux2ig,SwissBliss,1 point,Fri Feb 6 12:29:09 2015 UTC,"streetview.ch has some stuff, but it isn't great. I'm really suprised google didn't go there.   Do you want to see a specific street where you would live, or just to get a feel of Lugano. If it's the latter:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-tIGukNYzg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwXz9fWbee4  Again on the Como vs Lugano: Basically if you opt for Lugano, you'll get the nice weather and culture of Italy, with the ""richness"", economic and political stability of Switzerland."
Switzerland,2ux2ig,kaajyo,1 point,Fri Feb 6 13:14:02 2015 UTC,"...mmm, strange, there are in effect very few pictures of Lugano on google view, despite the fact that google car drove in town more than once...  As biased as my opinion can be, opt for Lugano if you can support your family with the life costs we have over here.  You can easily move around with public transportation, but check carefully your options depending on where you will settle - some areas, especially in the neighboring municipalities, are not as well served as the town itself, i.e. don't choose the place because of the nice view from the hill or you will need a car :-)"

So yeah, Saudi women can't drive de facto because their own governement doesn't give them licenses, but if they were to live here they would be able to learn how to drive like everyone else, so the title is more clickbait and misleading than anything else..."

Switzerland,2us9lf,Krpano,2,Thu Feb 5 08:40:17 2015 UTC,"So you know, these are all kind of close to each other. - Luzern , considered one of the most beautiful cities in CH - Hammetschwand lift, highest elevator in europe. It is nice to take the geared train from the bottom of the lake to Burgenstock (which can be reached by boat from Luzern) and hike to the elevator (easy and short hike) - Pilatus Mountain, beware it is full of tourist all the time - Interlaken and Brienz - Jungfrau mountain - Lauterbrunnen, is filled with all types of hiking trails and cable cars/trains - Furkapass and Grimselpass  These are also grouped together - Fribourg and its old city is nice - Gruyère with its castle and Giger Museum (creator of Alien) - Moléson Mountain, nice and all sorts of difficulties trails  Some scattered places worth mentioning - Creux-du-Van near Neuchatel (for hiking) - Schwarzsee, cute little place where you can do lots of activities like easy hiking, reant a canoe for the lake, get a lift to the top of the mountain and go downhill with a all terrain two wheels device - Titlis, it seems they have some kind of high suspended bridge. Havent been there yet. - if you venture your self to the Valais you have the Grand Dixence Dam, and Sanetsch mountain for hiking And further south there is the beautiful Lugano and Locarno (with the nice Versasca Dam and river)  Just so you know, if there is a mountain or even a slope (lol) there is hiking trails with different kinds of difficulties (and probably cable cars/trains). You can search online for swiss trail signs for that Most places you can hike from the bottom or take a transportation for a higher level.

Switzerland,2us9lf,carcharoth84,4,Thu Feb 5 11:45:21 2015 UTC,"Your username looks norwegian, so I won't recommend you mountain tours here.  Instead I suggest you to visit Bern, the capital of Switzerland (http://www.bern.com/en/index.cfm). Not only because it's my hometown, but also because the historic city centre is really unique and beautiful. You can easily spend a day there, watching the place, having a coffee (or beer) in one of the dozens of nice cafés, go shopping, whatever floats your boat.   Main tourist attractions are the bear park in the middle of the city (free admission, http://www.baerenpark-bern.ch/) and the cathedral (""Münster"") with an awesome judgement day painting at the entry door. Also, on top of the cathedral tower you have an epic view over the city! Tourists like to visit the Einstein house (place where Albert Einstein developed his relavity theory) and the Paul Klee centre (mainly works of the painter Paul Klee, plus seasonal shows).   If you are into beer culture, don't miss the Altes Tramdepot (http://www.altestramdepot.ch/htm/e_home.htm - they brew an excellent amber beer there) and the beer bar ""Au Trappiste"" (http://www.autrappiste.ch/), where you can choose from a selection of about 100 local and international beers.  For scenic views get yourself on the Gurten mountain, either hiking (2 hours max, easy walk) or by cable train. You'll find more hikes here: http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/top-hikes.html  I especially recommend you the ""Swiss Chocolate and Cheese Trail"" from that site. Done that hike myself several times and I find it really awesome."

""B1"" and then I think I went near ""Alp Fursch"" and then went east to Zigerfurgglen, follow path #4, then #5 down to ""Alp Grueb"" then you can either go the short but steep way down or take #7 to Seebenalp, eat something overprized there ($20?) and then follow #9, #12 to that Floomzer thing to take ""B2"", not sure what it costs, maybe another $20? It's kinda short but worth it.  I think cable car ticket is 22 for adults, 14 for teenagers <18y. Plus that floomzer thing, probably around the same."

Take the elevator that goes straight up the outside vertical cliff of Bürgenstock (spectacular views). When the elevator doors open you are faced with a cliff hanging suspended bridge walk across to main peak. Hang onto your balls and walk across to said peak.   Pro tip: wear a diaper.

Switzerland,2uraen,seitgeist,2,Wed Feb 4 15:56:13 2015 UTC,+1 for Arosa. I went there with my girlfriend around New Years and it was lovely. The ski area is also enormous now that it's connected to Lenzerheide.
Switzerland,2uraen,CatnipFarmer,2,Thu Feb 5 13:03:09 2015 UTC,"St. Moritz / Celerina is still my favorite place for snowboarding.  But it is a 2.5h drive from Zurich. So, for a day trip it is quite far away.   2nd choice is Arosa (also 2h drive from Zurich).  If you want to go to Austria, I would recommend St. Anton, which has a very large ski area (Also, a lot of food for little money).  I actually like Austria, people are more friendly, it is cheaper and you will get much more food (and good food!) for your money.  But I try to support the Swiss Economy and spend at least 1 week in St. Moritz every winter.   Your biggest problem is, that you are here during the official winter school holidays (9. Feb. - 20. Feb.). Which means, everything is even more expensive and there are a lot, a lot of people on the slopes. So you might want to plan one day trips only and get there first thing in the morning. Meaning you catch the very first gondola going up to the mountain.   That being said you might want to consider to go to Flims, Flums or Engelberg. Those are much closer to Zurich, but rather small and not my favorites, but nice for a sunny day if there is enough snow."

It looks like Engelberg has a ton of snow right now, so maybe I'll check that one out one day and go to one of the further ones another.  Unfortunately, it looks like those areas might not have great snow right now.  St. Anton is the place the I'm leaning towards in Austria, so I'm glad to hear it's good!"

It's much cheaper and better!"
Switzerland,2uraen,hazelnussibus,2,Thu Feb 5 18:12:21 2015 UTC,"The skiing in Zermatt is amazing but there are so many electric vehicles driving around that it hardly feels ""car free."""
Switzerland,2uraen,hazelnussibus,1 point,Thu Feb 5 18:17:10 2015 UTC,"at least it's emission free. ;)  If your looking for calm ski vacations in the middle of now where, Zermatt is the wrong place."
Switzerland,2uraen,hazelnussibus,1 point,Thu Feb 5 19:21:29 2015 UTC,"Beside the most popular places, also think about going to one of the car-free ski resorts like Bettmeralp for example. Those places are very calm and deliver you a different feeling, like they remember you more of a place as it used to be.  In terms of pure skiing, always look for connected ski areas like 4vallees or Aletsch Arena. More fun IMO because you can switch more often and therefore get more variety."
Switzerland,2uraen,Elmarco84,1 point,Thu Feb 5 08:03:45 2015 UTC,"OP, are you planing on going on some day trips? If so I highly recommend Flumserberg. It's a little more than a one hour drive from Zurich and is super convenient. It's the closest decent ski resort. With 18 lifts and 65km, you'll be more than satisfied for one day.  Bonus: Flumserberg even has a train connection from Zurich HB.  On the weekend there is a direct train (S2) from Zurich HB to Unterterzen which brings you right to the gondola station of the ski resort in 1h10min.   If you have more time and want more lifts, you can go to:  Davos: Biggest ski resort around, but you have to get on a car shuttle train  Flims/Laax: ideal if you like freestyle skiing and snowboarding  Lenzerheide: generally nice, especially for skiers"
Switzerland,2uraen,Urgullibl,2,Thu Feb 5 19:31:30 2015 UTC,"Definitely doing day trips.  I think I've settled on Films/Laax for my first stop (assuming the people going with me are down, most of them work at ETH and probably have their own opinions on where they would like to go).

Every question about Switzerland has already been answered there and in these tough financial times the mods simply cannot tolerate two posts on the same topic when they have invested so heavily in a search function!  Seriously though,  EF is a great resource. It helped me a lot in the beginning and for the first few months here. Nowadays I have a lot of friends and I'm used to the place so I visit EF less often.  You can get PG Tips in COOP but its expensive (9CHF/80 bags). In general thiugh most of the tea is flavoured (lots of Twinings varieties but no English Breakfast) or weak as piss (Lipton).

Switzerland,2unn5c,SwissBliss,7,Wed Feb 4 07:03:57 2015 UTC,"If you speak french and german, go near Geneva. You will understand very little if you go to a swiss german area. Geneva is extremely international, so you'll definitely fit in. Swiss french is basically normal french with a tiny bit of an accent and a few different words, but swiss german is basically a different language. I don't know how much you know about Switzerland, but we have cantons, much like states. Don't live directly in the canton of Geneva, choose Vaud, specifically western Vaud. That way you live between Lausanne and Geneva (about 15 minute drive to each), but you'll live in the countryside, between the mountains and the lake. Very beautiful, peaceful, safe, and super close to two major swiss cities."
Switzerland,2unn5c,lhatchy1,1 point,Tue Feb 3 20:10:03 2015 UTC,"Concerning what you said about Swiss German, I have to disagree.   If you speak German, Swiss German is understandable, you may just need to get used to the faster speaking.

Switzerland,2unn5c,SwissBliss,2,Wed Feb 4 14:42:02 2015 UTC,"There is a HUGE difference between Swiss french to French, and Swiss german to German. Swiss french is 99.9% the exact same.

You won't need Italian or Rumansh as long as you don't go to Ticino or the hinterlands of Grisons.   Tea wise, you should be able to find good tea, but be ready to pay a fairly high price.

As for your question about tea, my city counts a fair amount of specialised tea stores. I don't know about the quality of the tea, but I haven't been disapointed by any just yet. You can also buy tea online, I believe. Prices can vary a lot, you can expect to pay up to 15-18 CHF for 100g of tea (perhaps even more)."

There is a great job market for IT, and i think as a teacher it's good you speak german and french, because there are french or bi lingual cantons near by. In switzerland it isn't that important that you can speak swiss german, it's very difficult to learn i think. I work in Bern (in IT too), live in Canton Freiburg and was born in Graubünden and i really can't speak the Swiss German from Bern neither from Freiburg.  I like tea too (but i think not on a british level ;-)) and i buy my tea at the train station in Bern, there's a shop called Tekoe (http://www.tekoe.com/).  But of corse, this is just my opintion."
Switzerland,2unn5c,BANKBILLS,1 point,Wed Feb 4 07:36:01 2015 UTC,"Is there a difference between Swiss French and Swiss German to French and German, respectively.       Swiss French vs French: No big difference Swiss German vs. German: It's like welsh or cockney to british english. You may understand some words, but most of it sounds like gibberish. You can ignore italian and rumantsch.      Tea: All those years, we only had Lipton-Stuff. Since 3-4 Years, we also have Twinings. And of course, there are some shops specialised in tea. Or you can import it from england.       Moving: Bern, Basel and Zurich are the IT-Headquarters, especially Zurich has a big IT-Scene. The downside is, that Zurich is really expensive. Bern is a bit cheaper."
Switzerland,2unn5c,Urgullibl,1 point,Wed Feb 4 10:45:53 2015 UTC,"Just a small thing in case you weren't aware of it but 'Swiss German' is a collection of dialects that are derived from the German language. Pronounciation and some words vary from place to place and not understanding Swiss German is normal for foreigners. I think the only non-Swiss people to understand it are south-Germans that know similar local dialects. So no worries about not knowing Swiss German!  Swiss French is easier, you can compare it to Belgian French, it's just French with some different words and some adjusted pronounciation. (Wikipedia lists the major differences: http://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Français_de_Suisse) Italian is only used in Ticino/Grisons and Rumantsch is only used in a small area in the mountains of Grisons."
Switzerland,2unn5c,stabmeinthehat,1 point,Wed Feb 4 12:00:58 2015 UTC,"The fact you know French/German is already enough. The languages are in regions of the country, not from person to person in a single area. See here for map.  I'm a Brit who moved here from Kent, and tea is something we bring over from the UK. You can get some British teas in the shops here, but it's usually a brand that is very weak tasting. The range of British tea is much greater just over the border in Germany.  I'm willing to answer any questions you have, as I've made this move myself, UK --> Switzerland."
Switzerland,2uobjs,dwenjang,3,Tue Feb 3 20:35:34 2015 UTC,"I think you can roll Berner Oberland, Interlaken and Jungfraujoch into one.

Switzerland,2uobjs,skagen,2,Tue Feb 3 21:50:30 2015 UTC,"Jungfraujoch is near Interlaken and they are both in the area called Berner Oberland. From Bern to Jungfraujoch should be approximately 3 hours by train, so doable in 1 day, but I would recommend spending time in Wengen where you get spectacular views of the Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau."

Switzerland,2uobjs,Iylivarae,2,Tue Feb 3 23:47:39 2015 UTC,"It is possible to do that from Bern. The trip to Jungfraujoch takes a while, but it's completely possible to do it from Bern. Interlaken - in my opinion - is not a really pretty town to go to. It is very touristic, obviously, but I think there are much nicer mountain villages than Interlaken. Also, it would be possible to do part of the journey Interlaken-Bern by boat. There are course ships both on the lake of Brienz and on the lake of Thun. If the weather is nice, that's a lovely way to spend some time looking at the mountains. Also, if you want to stay in the Berner Oberland for a night or so, it's nice to travel to Lucerne via the Brünig, it is a nice train trip across the mountains, with lovely landscapes to look at, and the train is very comfortable.  EDIT: And no, I wouldn't skip Bern. It's a very unique city. But you can certainly see all the important stuff in one day and then go someplace else. Also, from Bern you can travel to the Wallis (with Zermatt) and the Berner Oberland, so it's quite convenient to stay a night."
Switzerland,2uobjs,Iylivarae,1 point,Tue Feb 3 22:19:30 2015 UTC,Thank you for the detailed reply. I will have to start planning my route and decide where I'm going to stay for housing.

Switzerland,2uobjs,Iylivarae,2,Tue Feb 3 22:27:49 2015 UTC,"I think Bern and Lucerne are somewhat too close to be your main places of residence.   I personally would probably do something along the lines of: Zurich - Lucerne - Berner Oberland/Interlaken/Grindelwald - Berne - Gruyere - Lausanne - Zermatt, and then take the Glacier Express Train across the Mountains... You can go either to Chur or St. Moritz or so, although I personally don't find St. Moritz that appealing (the mountains are great, though, but there are prettier villages there, like Celerina). Then you can stay there for a night and travel to St. Gallen, add a trip to Appenzell and then back to Zurich."

Switzerland,2uobjs,happl,2,Wed Feb 4 14:53:33 2015 UTC,"You're welcome :-) It largely depends on your flight schedule, I've both used Geneva and Zurich airports, and they both work fine. Geneva airport is a bit smaller, but on the upside check-in was quicker. Both airports have a train station right there, so both are fine.  If you want to fly back home from Geneva I'd probably do something like...  Zurich - St.Gallen/Appenzell - Chur/St. Moritz/Celerina, then Glacier Express to Zermatt - Bern (stay there and make a day trip to Lucerne and one to Berner Oberland/Wengen/Grindelwald) - Gruyere - Lausanne - Geneva."

Don't forget to visit mount Saentis http://www.saentisbahn.ch/ When good wheater there's a great view! Then take the Voralpenexpress from Saint Gallen or Herisau to Lucerne. Next Berner Oberland where i would stay in Interlaken. From there you can visit Bern (don't miss the http://www.baerenpark-bern.ch/ ), Grindelwald/Jungfraujoch or Mürren/Schilthorn (also know as Piz Gloria from a James Bond movie) as a day trip by train. Then from Interlaken to Brig by regional train (scenic route) and not by the intercity (tunnel) and stay there or continue to Zermatt (expensiver) and taking the train to Gornergrat where you have a nice view to the famous Matterhorn. Last comes Lausanne/Montreux and a day trip to Grueyere.   For twelve days i would choose a Swiss Pass for 15 continuos day. All railways and local transportation are included and for Saentis, Jungfraujoch, Schilthorn and Gornergrat you'll pay a reduced price."
Switzerland,2uobjs,Skinnj,1 point,Wed Feb 4 04:42:31 2015 UTC,Thank you for the detailed reply; another user said that Interlaken is not really a pretty town.

Switzerland,2uobjs,k-wum,1 point,Wed Feb 4 11:57:22 2015 UTC,it's not really a big difference in aspect of getting from place to place. - about an hour from Bern to Interlaken by train when visiting Jungfraujoch or Schilthorn - when visiting Zermatt travel Bern-Kandersteg-Brig-Zermatt because of the scenic views and Zermatt-Visp-Bern back - when visiting Lausanne travel Bern-Zweisimmen-Montreux (Goldenpass) and Lausanne-Bern back

Switzerland,2uobjs,huazzy,2,Wed Feb 4 11:55:10 2015 UTC,"You could do that but the trip from Lucerne to Appenzell takes almost 3 hrs by train, so you'd lose a lot of time just travelling there."
Switzerland,2uobjs,huazzy,2,Wed Feb 4 12:12:10 2015 UTC,"Good point; in the back of my mind, making multiple reservations for housing adds even more stress to planning. Maybe I should make Lucerne and Bern my main two housing locations and then try to make cheap sleeping arrangements to places that are 3 hours out.   Can you please tell me which website is best to make hotel/motel accommodations?  Thanks again!"
Switzerland,2uobjs,MialoKoukoutsi,2,Wed Feb 4 13:31:37 2015 UTC,"Alternatively you could stay in St.Gallen (which also has quite a nice old town and an interesting history), it's located roughly half an hour from Appenzell and two hours from Lucerne.  I never really had to look up hotels here but I guess www hotel24.ch is alright.  E: I just looked and there seem to be quite a few couchsurf hosts in the area, so you could try your luck there."
Switzerland,2uobjs,MialoKoukoutsi,2,Wed Feb 4 14:02:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the suggestion; I think I will take your advice and go into Appenzell before I head to Lucerne.  I was looking at Airbnb around Appenzell and they have private rooms for $32 a day.  I never used couchsurf in my life, but that is literally sleeping on someones couch right? Thanks again!  Edit:  Also, what do you think about flying into Zurich and then flying out of Geneva, would that be better for my trip since I'm going from East to West?"
Switzerland,2uobjs,SwissBliss,2,Wed Feb 4 14:12:26 2015 UTC,"Depends whether or not the host has a seperate bed or couch but you'd live with them while they're there but I've only heard positive stuff from friends that travel with it. There's /r/couchsurfing ; they might have a better answers to your questions, especially about couchsurfing in Switzerland.  I've never flyn out... flewn... flabedibab... I think flying out of Geneva is actually a good idea, it's just more comfortable rather than having to spend a day travelling back to Zurich.

Switzerland,2ug8m7,AmazonExplorer,1 point,Mon Feb 2 16:11:46 2015 UTC,"there isn't actually that much cacao in ovomaltine. the main ingredient is malt extract (whatever this is). wikipedia says that egg is only used in the Swiss ovomaltine and the Swiss version does not contain additional sugar. if this is true, the only reason I can think of is that Swiss people are adapted to this taste and thus the recipe was not changed."
Switzerland,2ug8m7,brumgabrasch,1 point,Mon Feb 2 22:23:32 2015 UTC,IIRC Malt extract is a sirup usually made from barley malt. It's sweet but unlike sugar syrup has its own malty taste. To make malt dried grain is soaked in water and then left  for some days until it starts germinating. The germination is then stopped by drying the grain again.

The first time I heard about the US justice system was something like 15 years ago when they tried to prosecute an 11 year old boy from Switzerland for sexual abuse. He was taken out of his home in cuffs and jailed for weeks to come. The US is huge of course and the chance of something like this happening to you is minuscule, but god damn these kinds of justice system horror stories just keep repeating year after year.   If OP is truly innocent, they have nothing to fear.   He's saying that he is being framed though. So if evidence is fabricated against him, things might look very different."

Switzerland,2uh08n,YeaISeddit,4,Mon Feb 2 15:47:07 2015 UTC,Switzerland has extradition treaties with the USA and OP would need to get a background check in order to rent a flat or get a job. He has zero chance of living as a man on the run in Switzerland. Maybe as an anonymous hobo at the Geneva main train station he can settle into a new life.
Switzerland,2uh08n,Urgullibl,12,Mon Feb 2 16:00:06 2015 UTC,"Switzerland doesn't extradite its citizens without their consent though, which is probably what OP is gambling on."
Switzerland,2uh08n,YeaISeddit,4,Mon Feb 2 16:02:46 2015 UTC,Is that right? I read through the extradition treaties and I didn't see any language that implied that. OP is probably also a US citizen. Basically any offense that has a punishment longer than 1 year and less than a death penalty is extraditable. I would guess that OP doesn't have as much political pull as Roman Polanski and won't be able to corrupt the extradition process.
Switzerland,2uh08n,Urgullibl,11,Mon Feb 2 06:44:02 2015 UTC,Art 25.1 of the Federal Constitution is quite clear on this. No extradition of Swiss citizens without their consent.
Switzerland,2uh08n,Lejeune_Dirichelet,3,Mon Feb 2 06:47:57 2015 UTC,"Was going to mention it. Thank you.   However, I know Swiss citizens can be tried (under Swiss law) for crimes committed upbroad.

Since Switzerland doesn't extradite it's citizens, you can basically just fly over here, log in to your bank accounts and transfer all the money (As long as the accounts haven't been flagged or something of course). I also don't understand why you can't contact people? How is this too dangerous? I mean, when I got your story right, you're being framed for a crime and not followed by killers? Aand I also don't get the welfare part of your father... Guessing from your ""Seven years of luxurious lifestyle"", you're at least, say,  28 years old?

I would recommend you to drive from Zurich to Andermatt and Realp, take the train (you drive on it with your car) to Oberwald and from their either make the big round via Martigny/Montreux/Bern or the shorter via Lötschberg (again a train) and Brünigpass via Lucerne back to Zurich.  The long route: http://i.imgur.com/vxzwJ6I.png  Please note that going clockwise, the last part from Sitten back to Zurich is pure freeway and not very interesting if you want to see mountains.  The short route: http://i.imgur.com/q5rEmTO.png  The short route is definitely the better choice here. You will pass some lakes, see more mountains and have the bigger pleasure to drive.  An alternative route would be Gotthard Pass and San Bernardino Pass (http://i.imgur.com/zxwwzWu.png). You would traverse the Gotthard through the road tunnel, drive down the canton Tessin to Lumino and then take the turn towards San Bernardino pass, wich also has a road tunnel. From there you would drive via Chur back to Zurich.  The Tessin is quite beautiful and the road back through Via Mala and Walensee is not bad either.  Also, instead of taking the freeway through Lucerne and around the west side of Lake Lucerne, you can take the freeway to Arth-Goldau and Brunnen after driving by Zug and pass the lake on the east side. Definitely more scenic but I guess the Axenstrasse (the road around the eastern lake shore) will take you more time. I plotted that road on the third map provided.  If you drive to Andermatt, make sure to leave the freeway in Erstfeld or Amsteg. You will want to drive up the valley off the freeway.  The same applies to the road from Splügen to Thusis on the alternative route I proposed. Get off the freeway and enjoy the ride down the Via Mala gorge."

Mais jaloux, un bon Genevois M’a dit, d’un petit air narquois: «Permettez qu’on vous interroge: Où sont vos fleuves, franchement?» Il oubliait tout simplement La Venoge!  Un fleuve? En tout cas c’est de l’eau Qui coule à joli niveau. Bien sûr, c’est pas le fleuve Jaune, Mais c’est à nous, c’est tout vaudois, Tandis que ces bons Genevois N’ont qu’un tout petit bout du Rhône. C’est comme: «Il est à nous le Rhin!» Ce chant d’un peuple souverain. C’est tout faux! Car le Rhin déloge. Il file en France, aux Pays-Bas, Tandis qu’elle, elle reste là, La Venoge!  Faut un rude effort, entre nous, Pour la suivre de bout en bout Tout de suite on se décourage. Car au lieu de prendre au plus court, Elle fait de puissants détours, Loin des pintes, loin des villages. Elle se plaît à traînasser, A se gonfler, à s’élancer Capricieuse comme une horloge. Elle offre même à ses badauds Des visions de Colorado, La Venoge!  En plus modeste, évidemment. Elle offre aussi des coins charmants, Des replats pour le pique-nique. Et puis, la voilà tout d’un coup Qui se met à faire des remous Comme une folle entre deux criques. Rapport aux truites qu’un pêcheur Guette, attentif, dans la chaleur, D’un oeil noir comme un oeil de doge. Elle court avec des frissons, Ça la chatouille, ces poissons, La Venoge!  Elle est née au pied du Jura, Mais en passant par La Sarraz, Elle a su, battant la campagne, Qu’un rien de plus, cré nom de sort! Elle était sur le versant nord : Grand départ pour les Allemagnes! Elle a compris! Elle a eu peur, Quand elle a vu l’Orbe sa soeur, – Elle était aux premières loges – Filer tout droit par Yverdon Vers Olten ! elle a dit: pardon ! La Venoge!  Le Nord, c’est un peu froid pour moi: J’aime mieux mon soleil vaudois Et puis, entre nous, «je fréquente!» La voilà qui prend son élan En se tortillant joliment. Elle n’a qu’à suivre la pente. Mais la route est longue, elle a chaud. Quand elle arrive, elle est en eau – Face au pays des Allobroges – Pour se fondre amoureusement Entre les bras du bleu Léman, La Venoge!  Pour conclure, il est évident Qu’elle est vaudoise cent pour cent. Tranquille et pas bien décidée, Elle tient le juste milieu, Elle dit: «Qui ne peut ne peut!» Mais elle fait à son idée. Et certains, mettant dans leur vin De l’eau, elle regrette bien – C’est, ma foi, tout à son éloge – Que ce bon vieux canton de Vaud N’ait pas mis du vin dans son eau,...  ... La Venoge!

Although we don't have any big mountains (well, we have a couple, but not as high as the Alps), we have quite a lot of nice rural areas, especially since we don't have big cities like Lausanne, Geneva or Zürich. We are in the middle of the röstigraben, so a lot of people are bilingual and can properly communicate with the other side of the country (sorry Ticino).  Even though Fribourg (city) isn't big, is has a minimum of city shops and entertainement, and if it isn't enough... Well Bern is half an hour away and Lausanne about three quarters of an hour away (by train). With a car and a designated driver, you can easily go anywhere to party (or do shopping, for those inclined). On the political/economical side.. We are on of the only cantons that has a more credit than debts, so we have that going for us, which is nice."
Switzerland,2uamna,TheMaskedTom,5,Tue Feb 3 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"Fribourg is one of the most underrated cantons - extraordinarily gorgeous scenery and magnificent choral music. Whenever my étranger friends come to visit, I am sure to take them up to Fribourg!"
Switzerland,2uamna,Grilled_Bear,3,Tue Feb 3 17:14:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not that keen about choral music, but the Moleson, the Gruyères Castle and cheese factory, the Villars Chocolate Factory in Broc, these are all easy wins for visiting foreigner relatives, that's true."
Switzerland,2uamna,mixblast,3,Sat Jan 31 16:42:29 2015 UTC,"Plus, low taxes. I know quite a few people who commute to Bern or Lausanne and moved to FR for that reason."

Switzerland,2uamna,Idontlikeyourhat,2,Sun Feb 1 14:17:12 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUGmJLjs0FY  Not actually what I think. Even though I really like the Aargau I'd say the best canton is either Fribourg or Glarus.

Switzerland,2uamna,Cluesol22,1 point,Sun Feb 1 21:49:27 2015 UTC,"This doesn't require a new thread so I'll ask my question here.  Which is a better student town, Lausanne or Zurich? With Zurich it is easier to find an ""affordable"" flat within reasonable distance, but as mentioned here it is hard to find in Lausanne. I've seen a few negative comments before in this subreddit about Zurich, is there something I don't know about the city? Also, if it is not much to ask, could someone please fill me in about the general life in both cities in short?"
Switzerland,2uamna,Lejeune_Dirichelet,1 point,Sat Jan 31 16:22:49 2015 UTC,"I can't really answer about Zurich, but Lausanne is definitely a great option. Great schools/unis, good party town if you're into that, really nice location next to the lake between the Jura and Alps, close to lots of good skiing locations, close to Geneva, Sion and other big cities. Also Vaud is the best canton ;)"
Switzerland,2uageb,nellirn,4,Sat Jan 31 08:38:06 2015 UTC,Maybe you should give limitations with regards to your budget ;) In Zurich you can stay one night at a noble hotel that costs as much as a week in a more affirdable one!
Switzerland,2uageb,taetscher,3,Sat Jan 31 11:42:05 2015 UTC,"For a week, you'll likely find a much better deal through airbnb than at a hotel.

Switzerland,2u87i5,shinnen,3,Fri Jan 30 23:30:28 2015 UTC,"i think the only place where dogs are not allowed are children playgrounds. but i don't think anyone cares if you actually have it leashed and got doggy bags on you.  outdoor activities are best though. and most fun, especially in the snow. i wouldn't suggest skiing or sledging though, can be quite dangerous with dogs. on the other hand cross-country skiing and snow walking are great.  but in the end i agree with shinnen: whatever your dog likes the most, you sure will be able to find it."

The fact that the formalities are being processed allows me to stay longer until I get the permit?"

Switzerland,2u5xj2,goldenvile,1 point,Fri Jan 30 12:20:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with that. :) However, this particular degree allows me to work in administrative offices and all the institutions that deal with cultural issues, so it's not that bad. It also confirms my education in the field of linguistics, and the fact of finishing some studies - which was why I brought it up in the first place.  I just wanted to point out that I'm not a person fresh out of high school, but I already hold a degree - just not an extremely useful one. :)  As for the job search, I will focus on my previous job experience (translation, educational projects, etc.), but of course I'm keeping my expectations on landing a good job pretty low at the beginning.  I'm just wondering - in Poland, the degrees are also becoming more and more insignificant, but in the way of ""you have to have a degree, it just doesn't matter what kind of degree that is"". Do you think it is similar in Switzerland, or does it mean that degrees simply don't matter there, because the experience is most valued? Does it mean that a degree doesn't put me anywhere closer to a particular job, if someone that hasn't graduated from any university has, let's say, half a year longer experience with the topic?

For instance it's really hard to find a flat in Lausanne, if you don't have the budget of a wealthy person. So start looking for one NOW.  Transport is really good here, the public transportation system is really advanced and reliable. The tickets are not cheap (as everything here) but you can buy them at pretty much every stop.  With food it depens. There are many good restaurants around and you will find food at all times of the day. In the normal supermarkets (Coop and Migros), you can buy from really cheap to super expensive food pretty much everything so it's up to you. Note that most of the shops are closed on sunday except near the trainstations.  It's very easy to open a bank account, just go to the bank of your choice. They will speak englisch there. Not that most of them close at 5 pm.  I hope I helped. Enjoy."

It gets you free unlimited use of all city public transport, and then it does the same for all trains, buses and boats in all of Switzerland, and it cuts ticket prices for mountain railways/funiculars in half, so you can go and explore the whole country to your heart's content.   Depending on your age, you can either get the one for people under 25 at CHF 240.-- a month, or the one for students aged 25-30 at CHF 250.-- a month. If you do the monthly subscription, you will need to commit to having the AG for at least four months."

Switzerland,2u2z06,Maxx84,3,Thu Jan 29 19:40:16 2015 UTC,"So I can get from lets says Lausanne to Zurich by train without additional fees while being able to travel within Lausanne?   Yes. You can also take the boat over to Evian or to somewhere else on Lake Geneva, use all buses and trams in Zurich free of charge and take a free boat ride on Lake Zurich while you're at it. Here's a table and map showing where it's valid. TL;DR: Pretty much everywhere except funiculars, and it cuts prices in half for most of those. As you can see, it also covers some cross-border routes, which can be interesting if you want to do a shopping trip (from Lausanne, the boat service to Evian suggests itself, though I can also highly recommend a Saturday trip to the market in Domodossola).  (Edit: I can't justify paying for the thing considering what my current travel patterns look like, but man do I miss just being able to go to any train station and get on whatever train you want. It's magical and somewhat addictive.)  Voie 7 is only valid after 7 pm, so it's not much use for your daily commute or if you want to do a weekend excursion. It's mostly aimed at the party demographic."

If you plan on taking many trains, you can consider the half-fare travelcard, which is 175chf per year and gives you 50% discount on train tickets and around 30-40% discount on bus/metro/boat standard tickets (but not on the monthly passes). Since you are under 25, I think there are also other types of discounted tickets, for instance this one if you travel after 7pm, but I don't know much more about them.  Just one remark for the bank. It's easy if you have a standard residence permit. I know that some short-term students get a sort of exception from having a permit but then they cannot open an account."

It's simple to set up - just visit your nearest Post Office. Their debit card is accepted all over the country and they have many useful services for payments to utility companies and the like.   Their website: https://www.postfinance.ch

For me the biggest advantages of BCGE over Poste account are the debit card Maestro and the fact that i dont need a code generator device to login into my webaccount, plus you have an smartphone app to manage the account if you want. Also, ive seen rare small business that would not take debit card from Poste.  In any case i would avoid UBS and Credit Suisse."

Even if you're married, each person needs their own EIN to have a swiss bank account. Leave ""doing business as"" blank but indicate what country and state you'll be earning money in.  Then, for what your business does, just type ""Federal Law Requirements"" under the OTHER line.  On the page with Sole Proprietor questions, answer all of them NO (as long as they are true, of course).  Then select email or snail mail.  As I said before, the bank required that both my wife and I both had this number before they would associate an account to our name.

If someone has another example of how this affects our safety here in Switzerland I would love to hear it.  So let's assume this is an attempt at social engineering. There is no way it will accomplish anything. There's roughly 100 people wearing burqas in this country. Chances are, if this law passes, they will simply not be allowed out of the house. Also, since there are so few burqa wearers, the chances any of us interact with someone in a burqa in our time here is incredibly low.

Switzerland,2tprjo,ruggar,15,Mon Jan 26 12:43:10 2015 UTC,"The first few rows almost never survived as the soldiers didn't have anything to defend themselves with.    Can you imagine being the guy in front and seeing another group of pikemen marching towards you and you know that you won't survive? It's crazy to think how they wouldn't just run away...  Here's a description of a battle like this:   The push of pike would continue until one of the opposing formations collapsed, which would generally lead to massive casualties. During push of pike, opposing blocks of pikemen would advance with their pikes ""charged"" horizontally at shoulder level to jab at one another until bodily contact was made. The two sides would then push physically until one or other of them gave way. This habit had on many occasions disastrous consequences as the side with the longest pikes had the advantage during push of pike.   Also very interesting is that the word Nostalgia used to be called mal du suisse because it was first described by the anxiety of Swiss mercenaries fighting away from home.   The term was coined in 1688 by Johannes Hofer (1669–1752) in his Basel dissertation. Hofer introduced nostalgia or mal du pays ""homesickness"" for the condition also known as mal du Suisse ""Swiss illness"" or Schweizerheimweh ""Swiss homesickness,"" because of its frequent occurrence in Swiss mercenaries who in the plains of lowlands of France or Italy were pining for their native mountain landscapes. Symptoms were also thought to include fainting, high fever, indigestion, stomach pain, and death. Military physicians hypothesized that the malady was due to damage to the victims' brain cells and ear drums by the constant clanging of cowbells in the pastures of Switzerland.[9]   Those damned cowbells!"

It's basically that or celibacy, i.e. denying your biological urges. I think context is important if you want to judge people (which in itself is a questionable idea anyways when it comes to long past history).  Also, I wouldn't worry too much about Switzerland's image abroad - for the most part it's just fine, I'm constantly abroad and I've never had anyone react negatively just because I told them that I'm Swiss.

It's still good to know about it, so we can understand the world better. Switzerland's identity and everything surrounding it (neutrality, strong federalism, direct democracy) was heavily influenced by the culture that was protected by these same men that did those 'savage' acts[1]. And I think we're better off for it today.   [1] I'm putting savage in quotes here, because I think there is a gradient from savage to civilised, and fighting in wars in itself is not yet on the highest scale of savagery as long as civilians are spared.

It seems to me that the choosed deliberately sentences which differred from Züridütsch. The closer a region lies to the Romandie, the more french words are used (like in the video ""poussette, bisou, parapluie, merci).  My advice: Work on your High German, it's just of much more use, the dialects you can pick up along the way. Which one does not matter.  Edit: I understand that everyone in this thread seem to think the difference between the dialects is enourmous. That's probably wishful thinking, just not the true. Once you know one dialect, you may need a bit time to get used to a another, but it' s really not such a big deal, let alone like learning another language."

I am from the canton of Berne - a dialect which is well beloved and pretty close to the Wallis - so I am able to understand it.  However, I recently made a short film in Walliserdütsch and had to do subtitles for the swiss german speaking audience (mostly people from Zurich) because I was told that they barely understand anything.  It's a very strange, but cool dialect. You might be better of with Züridütsch because I love the idea of learning Swiss german."

From personal experience, I have german friends who from the start tried to speak swiss german and it sounds like a german trying to speak swiss german even after many years. Another one however didn't for the first three years here and was spoken to in swiss german only, having him get a good grasp of the language. He speaks swiss german almost perfectly now, you really can't tell he didn't grow up with it.  Also, VS-deutsch might be a bit extreme to start with, it should give you a good idea of the grammatical structure of all dialects however, as most dialects vary mainly in vocabulary and intonation."

Switzerland,2tgxmf,SuperCronk,5,Sat Jan 24 01:37:20 2015 UTC,Go hike the Creux du Van. It's a giant crescent-shaped gorge about 20 minutes from Neuchatel (take the SBB to Noiraigue and start your hike from there). It would most likely be a day trip out of Geneva. It's an absolute hidden gem of incredible geography that I feel doesn't get mentioned enough outside the country because it gets overshadowed by all the other large alpine mountains. Here's a link for some more info: http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/creux-du-van-travers-valley.html
Switzerland,2tgxmf,rosenjazz,1 point,Sat Jan 24 04:57:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that! That looks amazing. After some more research i think we may stay in Bern and then venture out to Neuchatel, Solothurn and maybe Engelberg. And then spend a week or so in Geneva."
Switzerland,2tgxmf,stabmeinthehat,2,Sat Jan 24 05:00:18 2015 UTC,"I would skip Geneva itself (especially a whole week there) and spend your time at the other end of the lake - Lausanne, Vevey, Montreux and the Alpes Vaudoises."

Switzerland,2tgxmf,rosenjazz,5,Sat Jan 24 09:08:11 2015 UTC,"I don't find Geneva to be a particularly interesting city. A lot of Swiss people even say that ""Geneva isn't Switzerland, its Geneva.""  There is more natural beauty at the far end of Lake Geneva. The Lavaux area is a UNESCO World Heritage site that is simply stunning, Rochers-de-Naye offers one of the best viewpoints over Lake Geneva. There are a lot more options to explore the mountains and the rest of the country (e.g. Neuchatel for the hike mentioned above) is very accessible by train.  I could also be biased because I live at this end of the lake :)  September/October is one of my favourite times for hiking here. Most of the tourists have gone, the weather is mild, not too hot or too cold. The views tend to be more clear (but you can get a few solid days of rain in October)."

Switzerland,2tgxmf,Yalacha,1 point,Sat Jan 24 10:20:56 2015 UTC,I should mention - it's best to do this if you're going in October or before any snow has fallen. I tried hiking it in late March and I was ankle deep in snow a couple kilometers in.
Switzerland,2tgxmf,baiboon,5,Sat Jan 24 05:33:01 2015 UTC,"Just as a tip, St. Moritz is incredibly expensive. It's basically a skiing resort for the rich and is priced as such. If you want to explore Graubünden (the canton St. Moritz is situated in, and also the one I'm from), I'd set up base in Chur and go from there with trains and busses. There is no nice and central place in GR to be close to everything, but Chur is the biggest town and is connected both to the RhB (local railway), the SBB (Swiss railway) and also to the post car network (long distance busses).   There is quite a lot to do around Chur already, and the further you're willing to go away, the more possibilities open up (duh).   For camping, best go up some mountain that isn't overrun by tourists. There are some where you can get pretty far up with rope lifts so you don't have to carry a tent around all the time. I'd say even if you went up the Dreibündenstein (mountain right next to Chur) and walked up to the summit (quite easy hike, shouldn't be a problem with a tent) then you should have good sky, even though you're relatively close to the city (it's only 30k people though). But probably going further into a valley you'll have better results."
Switzerland,2tgxmf,ProstateDeGorille,3,Sat Jan 24 06:57:05 2015 UTC,"One very nice, but not so crowded city is solothurn (or soleure in french). The architecture is unique in switzerland, because of it's baroque style. It's not very big, only about 17000 residents but there are very few international tourists and it's easily accessible by train. If you want to see how switzerland looks, that's one of the more authentic(and pretty) places.  But i don't even think you have to decide. The public transportation in switzerland is excellent.Even the really small towns have a bus or train arriving at least every hour and on time. Punctuality is a stereotype we're proud of ;-) . So my suggestion is: go to a central place, bern for example, and then you can visit solothurn( about 40 minutes by train) on one day, go skiing in gstaad (about 90 minutes) on another. And the day you feel lazy you see what's going on in bern. The site of the national public transportation service is this: sbb.ch"

Switzerland,2tcuup,Zeeras,19,Fri Jan 23 01:48:24 2015 UTC,"About jobs: Most jobs will require you to know German, but there should be jobs you can do with only a basic knowledge of the language. If you want to get into truck driving, you'll probably have to acquire a proper license here but other than that I don't see what's stopping you. I doubt that your German will have to be perfect to drive a truck, but someone correct me if I'm wrong.  About racism: I wish I could tell you otherwise, but from my personal experience Switzerland can be quite xenophobic. Most black immigrants in Switzerland are asylum seekers from Africa who have entered Europe illegally to escape economic conditions or conflicts in their home countries. Because of their difficult legal status they tend to work under-the-table and are disproportionately involved in criminal endeavors (or at least that is the perception). The situation is somewhat similar to the situation of South American immigrants in the United States. Unfortunately you will probably be assumed to be an illegal immigrant by many people you meet, much like Hispanic and Latino Americans often have to deal with the perception that they are illegal immigrants in the United States.

Switzerland,2tcuup,csssss_,10,Fri Jan 23 03:14:17 2015 UTC,"Alright, quite some people have posted here already but I wanted to share my 5 Rappen as well.  First of all: I think your plan to work as a truck driver here is very realistic. Just know that driving here is very different to driving in the US, especially with a large vehicle. The roads can be pretty narrow and it happens every once in a while that trucks driven by people who aren't locals get stuck in a tiny dead end street because their navigation system led them astray. But overall, I think this is very possible.  Language: Since you won't need to go to school here or need to write much, I'd concentrate very much on learning Swiss German. Of course you'll need a certain level of the written language as well but I'd advise you not to neglect learning ""dialect"". People act very differently towards you if you speak Swiss German.  Which brings us to Racism, which is quite frankly often used as a buzzword. I dare say hardly anybody in Switzerland is racist (meaning that they actually believe people of color to be inferior because of their ""race""). People can be xenophobic though, especially on the countryside where there aren't many foreigners, save black people. As others have mentioned, many have the stereotype of the black north african asylum seeker drug dealer in their heads. To avoid being branded that way in their minds, take care of how you dress and carry yourself. I don't know your style, but it makes a giant difference. Dress well, maybe even a bit too formally I'd say. This would go a long way, IMHO. But in the end, you might have some bad encounters but overall I think you're not going to have too many problems. As soon as they would realize that you're from the US, I doubt anybody would have any xenophobic thoughts. Some people are just afraid of change and immigration is a part of that.  Best of luck to you and let us know how it goes!"
Switzerland,2tcuup,Motzlord,4,Fri Jan 23 16:33:59 2015 UTC,Yeah you will probably encounter a bit of racism sadly. A black friend of mine was kindly reminded once that she's sitting in first class on the train even though she had a valid ticket!  A lot of people see blacks here as  African asylum seekers that sell drugs and aren't to trust.  But that'll change very quickly once you let people know you're from the US.  A job as a truck driver won't be that difficult to get probably once you have citizenship.
Switzerland,2tcuup,seitgeist,5,Fri Jan 23 08:16:56 2015 UTC,"A job as a truck driver won't be that difficult to get probably once you have citizenship.   Citizenship might take a while even though they're married. It's more about having a residency permit and a work permit, which is easily obtainable when married."
Switzerland,2tcuup,P1r4nha,4,Fri Jan 23 10:43:48 2015 UTC,"Got it.   But thanks everyone for the information. I have experienced racism once while there but it's almost daily here in the states. I do my best to ignore and stay positive.   With the facts and opinions stated here, I'm still just as devoted to learning german and moving. I've done tons of research and it's very comparable to what's said here, I wanted clarification in the matters. Thanks everyone!"
Switzerland,2tcuup,P1r4nha,3,Fri Jan 23 14:36:46 2015 UTC,"I'd like to believe that our racism here is less malicious and more ignorant because of the lack of past slavery here. Maybe that gives you a better chance at fighting it by just informing people around you about your situation. This should distance you quickly form the ""African illegal immigrant drug dealer""-stereotype.  I wish you good luck with immigrating and integrating without too many obstacles."

Switzerland,2tcuup,pagkatapos,5,Fri Jan 23 23:41:09 2015 UTC,"From experience people will speak English to you in the German-speaking parts based on how ""foreign"" they see you. (My sister who looks more European than Asian gets spoken to in Standard German, so that's a step up.) Also the chances are high that the people you interact with on a daily basis (post office, shops, etc.,) are slightly patronising, but other than that, it's ok I guess! In the French part of Switzerland you will not get this subtle wearing down reminder that you can't possibly fit in (since all of them speak French by default), but the police are more harsh towards black people, particularly men. There's some definite racial profiling going on there.  But yeah, racism is alive in Switzerland - but it's not necessarily systematic racism (because we don't have the history of slave labour, etc., to back it up) but cold-blooded ignorance. Nevertheless we're not doing too bad, honest!"
Switzerland,2tcuup,Redxl1,8,Fri Jan 23 11:04:44 2015 UTC,"Being black in Switzerland is pretty tough, much more so than in the states. It can be very difficult to integrate here just being foreign but being black is even more rough, no doubt about it. The primary xenophobia is more towards Muslims and people from Russian influenced countries though, so I guess you wouldn't be completely at the bottom of the totem pole.  Once your honeymoon phase with Switzerland is over, you may really resent the decision to come here unless other plans work out for you like truck driving(your licenses should be fully valid here) and improving your language ability(you'll need this especially to defend yourself). The language is important because from my experience, the Swiss tend to be social cowards and will talk plenty of shit about a person behind their back and feel even more smug about it if they don't understand what is being said.  This has been my personal experience in the 3 years I've been here, obviously results will vary from person to person, canton to canton, etc etc. Good luck though, I hope it works out better for you.  Edit: regarding your licenses, make sure you make your US licenses officially Swiss versions within a year of being here or you'll have to go through drivers training again which is VERY expensive here."
Switzerland,2tcuup,Lockeylom,9,Fri Jan 23 10:08:13 2015 UTC,"Once your honeymoon phase with Switzerland is over   It's incredible the amount of people that I meet that want to move to Switzerland because of the beautiful landscapes and the amazing time they had during their vacations. They always get a bit sad when I tell them that working here and spending vacations here is a completely different thing.   Being black in Switzerland is pretty tough, much more so than in the states. It can be very difficult to integrate here just being foreign but being black is even more rough, no doubt about it. The primary xenophobia is more towards Muslims and people from Russian influenced countries though, so I guess you wouldn't be completely at the bottom of the totem pole.   Being black is really being at the low end of the ""social ladder"" in Switzerland. I had a friend that was stopped by the cops multiple times for no reason at all, which we all suspected was because of his skin color. The amazing thing was that he was adopted and could speak perfect Swiss German with a typical Bernese accent, which would lead to many occasions where people were racist towards him and he would completely blow them away by starting to speak in Bärndütsch while telling them to fuck off."

Being 6 hours behind you all makes it a little difficult to interact during a work day.   And as far as racism goes, I'm not too worried. Like someone mentioned earlier, I'm the black guy who's labeled as ""white"" because of the way I speak and carry my self. I'm usually dressed really well and very polite to strangers. Some say overdressed, but it's hard to believe an American truck driver and fashion goes hand and hand haha."
Switzerland,2tcuup,DeepDuh,2,Sat Jan 24 01:16:27 2015 UTC,"Truck drivers for companies like UPS or DHL are often foreigners. Try to look for jobs like ""Kurier"" (courier), ""Fahrer"" (driver) or ""Paketzusteller"" (parcel delivery man). Some of those jobs may require you to do night shifts and the wage certainly is not the best but as a first step...   You can look for jobs on websites like:  http://www.jobscout24.ch/de/ http://www.indeed.ch/m/ http://www.careerjet.ch http://chauffeur-jobs.ch  http://www.dhl.ch/en/careers.html http://en.jobs-ups.com/ch/home.htm  There are dozens of others websites of this kind.

Switzerland,2tcuup,DeepDuh,3,Sat Jan 24 18:04:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much about racism - it is likely that you will meet some people like that, but it probably won't affect your life too much. What will affect your life is language ability - which can go both ways. If your german is very broken, it will put some distance between you and the locals, if it's excellent you immediately get a bonus, considering that you look foreign. I think in order to get a job as a truck driver you'll probably need at least reasonable German, say somewhere around B2 level - this shouldn't be too hard to acquire within 3-6 months. So if I were you I'd just plan to be seeking work for at least 6 months and have enough money saved up to get through that time as well as doing a language course. My foreign wife has had a relatively good experience with 'Benedict' school (which is on the cheaper side), but it depends on the teacher of course.   All that being said I wish you the best of luck and hope everything works out well for you two."

However it was her third foreign language, so that probably makes a difference. If his fiancee pushes talking to him in German after 2 months of intensive learning it should be doable - being immersed makes a big difference."
Switzerland,2tcuup,tango-01,3,Fri Jan 23 12:51:49 2015 UTC,"your wife must be very talented/committed then, honest congrats to her.

Honestly, she sounds (almost) flawless. Her writing is good but the different cases in German are giving her some trouble. It was also her 4th or 5th language but still - if you're commited and have the right environment, this is totally doable. Not easy, but also not too hard."
Switzerland,2tcuup,Urgullibl,5,Fri Jan 23 16:36:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know the requirements for transferring your US truck license to a Swiss license, so you should probably talk to the relevant bureau and ask about it. As far as I recall, the theoretical exam papers are provided in a plethora of languages, so not speaking German shouldn't really be a problem here.  While there can be a degree of racism, keep in mind that there is not much of a black history and associated history of discrimination in Switzerland, so the amount of clichés to overcome is probably smaller than it would be in most of the US. You'll routinely meet people who have never seen a black person where you're going. As long as you have a job and people know you're working and earning a living, it shouldn't be too bad."

Switzerland,2tcuup,RagingOrangutan,4,Sat Jan 24 20:18:00 2015 UTC,"I had a really sad experience regarding racism against black people, here. I went to a bar with a black girl on Christmas (purely friendly, she has a Swiss boyfriend) and I could tell people were looking at me funny and avoiding me. It was very apparent that they thought I had brought a prostitute to the bar. I felt so horrible for her - if people were treating me differently just by association, I can't imagine how she must get treated. She told me that men had approached her and asked ""how much?"" The worst thing was that she was out with me on Christmas because her boyfriend's family didn't want to see her - they'd rather pretend she didn't exist. Really heartbreaking. I know that not all Swiss people feel this way, but there is at least some element that does.  I hope OP has a better experience. On the positive side, I have brown skin and people might think I am Muslim (I am not, nor am I Arab) but I haven't felt like I've faced serious discrimination here. Part of it may be the way I dress and carry myself (which is much more ""white"" - I grew up mostly around white people in the States, so culturally I am more white than anything else.) OP, sad as it is, it may help if you're also able to act/dress culturally white."

There is also a mentality of constantly pointing out other people's mistakes yet amazingly they see each other very indifferently (women with kids can wait until they fall over until someone helps them into trams with a stroller, stopping for someone at zebra crossing will more often than not earn you a look of death instead of a slight hand gesture signaling ""thanks"") its not all bad and I've met some decent people, but they are by large a minority (usually free thinkers/artists to start out with and are already in their grind groups things, which ate difficult to enter, esp. As a foreigner) The swiss wages are declining as well and are adapting to European average wages so that boat will have sailed soon as well. I recommend you don't move to this chocolate/cheese factory. The only thing I can recommend here is the traditional cheese fondue, which can be pretty epic.  In all the places I have lived in Europe (Germany, Switzerland, England and the Netherlands) the Netherlands is by far my favorite even though the weather is ruddy awful sometimes, but who cares, beaches are an hour airplane ride away and Amsterdam's airport is a minor European hub which will get you nearly anywhere without lay over). Generally politically incorrect towards everything but mostly in a joking manner, very easy going (I'm German so it was very weird for me to a) realize that yes, we Germans are stupidly organized and b) it also somehow works without too much organization), tough negotiators (they really are tradesmen by nature) and there is an amazing international community in Amsterdam. It's either that our Australia, as they supposedly also have great wages and are easy going too + beaches. Also, the Netherlands has some of the hottest women I have seen. I means, it's no Lithuania or Sweden, bit damn son, it's a close second (they all ride bikes here so amazing butts are plentiful) and again, I really can't stress this enough, they are very easy going.

Maybe I'm just more polite than the typical zebra-crossing person in Zürich. Who knows? Also, personally, I have never seen a driver ignore my little hand-wave gesture (they usually nod or give a little hand-wave back). It makes my day just a tad-bit brighter and I like to think that the driver's day is also just a little bit nicer because ""hey, someone acknowledged the fact that I stopped for him even though I'm legally obliged to do so""  Lastly, I have exclusively observed this behaviour in such an abundance here and it just adds to my list of reasons why I'm not a huge fan of the Swiss mentality at large and generally don't advise people to move here.

When I left GVA a few years ago, there were over 30,000 people on waiting lists for apartments for less than 50 vacancies. It's insane. There is no place to build, you can't build higher than 5 or 8 storeys high (to preserve aesthetics) and most of the real estate in the canton belongs to a few rich families. Once you have a ""real"" place, rents aren't that high compared to other world-class cities compared to income and quality of life. I paid the same amount for a shitty pad in Toronto but was making 3 times less money.  When I left my apartment, the building management demanded I find a replacement tenant. Within 2 hours of publishing an ad in the local newspaper (GHI) I had a list of nearly 50 people. It was a great place, I miss it!"
Switzerland,2t5odu,shinnen,1 point,Thu Jan 22 15:17:27 2015 UTC,"30 thousand is insane, I think there are other big European cities that face similar issues of a lack of affordable quality housing, especially for young people.   Are there Swiss / European initiatives to try and change this?

Switzerland,2t5odu,crapacitor,1 point,Thu Jan 22 15:46:18 2015 UTC,"The situation in GVA is dire because it's a tiny place in which you can't build because of stringent building laws and democratic opposition to any kind of change in general (the Swiss hate any kind of disruption). You also have to understand that each Swiss canton is its own sovereign state and that Switzerland isn't an EU member, so any initiative would have to be local in nature (like everything in Switzerland) and voted upon by the people.  Also, this situation benefits real estate owners who can charge more, which in turn pushes for higher wages, etc. The only solution is to live outside the city core, in the neighbouring canton of Vaud or in France. The Geneva canton is tiny and I really don't see them agreeing in building mega towers to house people in."

It was justified as long as the € crisis seemed somewhat contained, but considering Switzerland is a country where people tend to have savings rather than debt, inflation of its currency to this degree would not be in the best interest of the population."
Switzerland,2t61wk,Neirdark,9,Wed Jan 21 13:22:35 2015 UTC,"From the SNB's website:   The SNB is not in favour of a sovereign wealth fund. At present, the SNB's investment needs stem from the monetary policy requirement to enforce the minimum exchange rate, and from the associated foreign currency purchases. Therefore, when engaging in investment activities, the SNB must take account of monetary policy needs, and retain the flexibility to define the size and composition of its balance sheet. The assets in a sovereign wealth fund would be exposed to the same exchange rate risk as the SNB's currency reserves; even a much higher proportion of 'real' investments such as equities would offer no protection against value fluctuations. By investing part of the currency reserves in a well-diversified range of equities and corporate bonds, the SNB is able to exploit the positive contribution of these asset classes to the risk/return profile. At the same time, it retains the flexibility to adjust its monetary and investment policy to changing requirements.   http://www.snb.ch/en/ifor/public/qas/id/qas_assets#t23"
Switzerland,2t61wk,errorkode,0,Wed Jan 21 16:55:46 2015 UTC,"So a SWF would do exactly the same things that the SNB does, but would strangely be more exposed and more dangerous for our economy than SNB's activities. It's odd, isn't it?  I like how SNB's chiefs seem to be afraid to lose their prerogatives and their divine power over economy. My idea would simply be to stock a tiny part of dividends normally ""offered"" to the Cantons and to the Confederacy into specific funds keeping the money.   for investments in foreign and Swiss companies to help public infrastructures (cheaper SBB) to get strategic ressources (including building refineries) for science, technology and education !!!! as provisions for bad days   But yeah, SNB wouldn't be the Chosen One saving Swiss economy and the only big money manager anymore."

Switzerland,2t61wk,Urgullibl,8,Wed Jan 21 20:40:02 2015 UTC,"Because the SNB is supposed to be an independent institution, and creating one of those would expose it to more political meddling.

Edit: Or why not just use one fifth of them to pay off the national debt. #swissproblems"
Switzerland,2t61wk,Urgullibl,2,Wed Jan 21 18:22:18 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would separate an eventual SWF from SNB as it would work as a special stock corporation similar to SBB.

Switzerland,2t61wk,seitgeist,2,Thu Jan 22 08:42:13 2015 UTC,"This is what our lecturer Adriano Lucatelli said about this question. it's in german unfortunately  Braucht die Schweiz einen Staatsfonds? De quoi s‘agit it-il?  Die Schweizerische Nationalbank (SNB) verteidigt seit 6. September 2011 die Untergrenze von 1.20 Franken pro Euro. Als Resultat sind die Devisenreserven stark angewachsen: per Ende August 2013 auf rund CHF 444 Milliarden.  Normalerweise legt die SNB ihre Reserven hauptsächlich (ca. 90%) in ausländische Anleihen von hoher Qualität (z.B. Deutschland), Sonderziehungsrechte (SZR) und Edelmetalle (Gold) an.  Um das Klumpenrisiko abzufedern, soll die Schweiz einen Staatsfonds gründen, der in Realwerte wie Aktien, Immobilien oder Rohstoffe investieren kann und so die Inflationsgefahr aus dem Euroland reduzieren kann.  Nein! Warum?  •  Nationalbank hätte genug Ressourcen, der Bund aber nicht, um einen Staatsfonds zu gründen. Die Nationalbank hat aber andere Ziele zu verfolgen als ein Staatsfonds.  •  Die Nachfrage nach ausländischen Währung, um im Ausland zu investieren, wird den Franken nicht schwächen. Die Investoren durchschauen das Spiel mit der künstlichen Verschuldung zur Schaffung eines Staatsfonds.  •  Die SNB hat das Klumpenrisiko Euro durch Anlagen z.B. in Singapur-Dollars, schwedischen und dänischen Kronen, australischen Dollars, und US-Dollars bereits stark reduziert. Zusätzlich hat sie die Aktienquote auf 10% erhöht. SNB hat mit Nokia rund EUR 50 Mio. Kursgewinne erzielt.  •  Ein Staatsfonds kreiert politische Begehrlichkeiten, was einem Missbrauch Tür und Angel öffnet.  •  Bis der Staatsfonds durch das Parlament geboxt würde, bräuchte es wahrscheinlich die Untergrenze nicht mehr."

Die meisten westlichen Länder haben ausgebaute Sozialwerke und gut entwickelte Volkswirtschaften ohne Klumpenrisiken in einzelnen Branchen. Ausserdem verfolgen Demokratien einen liberalen Ansatz, der besagt, dass die Anpassungen über normale Marktkräfte vollzogen werden müssen.

Switzerland,2t1xz5,electrodraco,20,Tue Jan 20 20:53:02 2015 UTC,"I order pretty much everything from digitec.ch.  There are a few shops you should avoid:   Media Markt Interdiscount   They're usually the most expensive (despite their aggressive ads who tell you the opposite) and their employees usually don't know shit and sell you whatever they have at hand. Don't go there if you want fair prices or sound advice, they have neither."
Switzerland,2t1xz5,Kazumara,7,Tue Jan 20 15:07:42 2015 UTC,"Also they have little variety (e.g. only shitty brands for usb sticks) and higher prices. MediaMarkt Basel did not even carry SATA cables, or really any cables that go inside a computer. Wtf! They were selling Harddrives without cables included but didn't sell the cables seperately!  All those two care about are expensive TVs Laptops and Stereos and accessories with an absolutely huge markup and maybe some shitty low priced volume stuff that breaks after half a year."
Switzerland,2t1xz5,ThePadawan,2,Tue Jan 20 15:28:45 2015 UTC,"I generally agree, but should point out that i recently randomly found some Philips Hue for 69CHF at Media Markt (79CHF at digitec and pretty much everywhere else) as part of a sale."
Switzerland,2t1xz5,electrodraco,2,Tue Jan 20 17:32:24 2015 UTC,"If the customer doesn't know what he wants it's difficult to satisfy him 100%.   No, it's not. That's the only case advice is needed anyway. Satisfying customers that know what they want is easy, no staff interaction needed.   Most employees in these stores finished an apprenticeship, so saying ""They don't know shit"" is just wrong.   Of course they have finished an apprenticeship and learned how to collect money and fill up the shelves but that doesn't enable them to give sound advice to customers.  If a walk into STEG and ask for best cost/capacity S-ATA storage they'll usually immediately ask if I have S-ATA 3 compatibility or not and they'll immediately know that 2 TB disks give you the best cost/capacity ratio currently. They'll show you a list of all their disks and are able to explain to you the different characteristics of the disks available (e.g. cache size and rpm). The deal is closed in 5 minutes due to good customer support and I know exactly what I have bought and why that's the right thing for me.  Finishing an apprenticeship doesn't prepare you for these rather simple questions. The grandma who calls me over to connect her printer to her new 3000.- gamer PC she bought for reading emails has usually shopped at Media Markt, that's a recurring pattern. Good advice at Media Markt is rare. If you refuse to call that ""They don't know shit"", I'm fine with that. I don't care about the wording as long as the reader doesn't think he'll get sound advice there.   If you keep an eye out for discounts you can find some pretty sweet deals in these stores as well ;)   Would you please cite an example. There were others claiming the same and I just can't find a simple case where they underbid their competitors significantly.   Also why didn't you include Melectronics? Equal to iD in every aspect and also a major retailer.   I didn't mention Melectronics because I don't know them good enough yet. Their prices are similar, true, but the one time I shopped at Melectronics I found a Wii U Bundle that was significantly lower priced than Media Markt's offer and even lower than wog.ch. Upon buying the thing the lady at the counter even opened the package to check if everything was alright, something I never witnessed at Media Markt or Interdiscount. Maybe I was just lucky that one time I shopped at Melectronics and I didn't ask hard questions to the staff but it didn't seem to me to be the same customer experience."
Switzerland,2t1xz5,electrodraco,1 point,Wed Jan 21 08:04:54 2015 UTC,"A customer that knows what he wants does not equal a customer that knows everything about the desired object, so your assumption that no staff-interaction is needed is wrong.   You're playing definition-games with ""knows what he wants"" without being explicit what you're talking about. Explain the difference and we'll see.   Regarding prices, find me a cheaper price within Switzerland for this coffeemaker.   Accepted. I can't find that specific model anywhere else significantly cheaper. Just note that nettoshop.ch sells it for the same price without claiming a 50% price reduction.   I would love to see the ""gamer pc for 3k"" that Media Markt sells!   Ok, make it 2k. I can't show you that model because it was years ago. However, it doesn't really matter. If a customer tells you ""I need a computer just to read email"" and you're selling them something above 1k you're just exploiting their ignorance.   Oh and by the way, grandma didn't know what she wanted and is now not satisfied with her purchase for 100%, because she payed 3k!   Nice morals you have there. I can assure you the grandmas become very pissed when you tell them that the Raspberry Pi for 100.- would have been enough.   Also the clerk had probably a hard time to figure out what she wanted, because she was unable to tell him that she does not need the newest graphics card etc.   If you have problems figuring out what they want in this case you're simply incompetent. It's basic knowledge that you can't ask these customers about graphic cards even though they need one. Nevertheless, a good salesman can handle this, I don't see any reason why that would be a problem.   So you see, people who don't know what they want are hard to please.   Well, if you refuse to accomodate to their technological ignorance and explain to them the necessary concepts, then yes, they'll be as frustrated as when they entered your shop. Again, a good salesman knows this.   So I guess all your negative opinions about a store are also based on ONE experience? NICE, you are perfect to give others advice!   I said it's a recurring pattern. I had multiple cases of Media Markt customers that were sold overpriced products which they clearly didn't need from the requirements they told the staff. Also I made it pretty clear on the Melectronics issue that I'm not generalizing from isolated cases.  Don't start ad hominem arguments when you run out of valid arguments, especially not when they're so obviously wrong.   Or do you go to the supermarket and ask a clerk about the change in grape quality of wine XY over the past 6 years?   Which was my original point: Don't go to Media Markt if you need sound advice. Why are you asking me that again?"

Switzerland,2t1xz5,bigl00z3,7,Wed Jan 21 19:10:52 2015 UTC,toppreise.ch should always be checked before buying something.   On quite a few occasions it saved me a fair amount of money ( or sometimes confirmed I would get it from a local shot where I get the service extra)
Switzerland,2t1xz5,relevant_rhino,1 point,Tue Jan 20 18:15:26 2015 UTC,I compared a gaming keyboard on toppreise and microspot was 30.- cheaper than digitec. So i orderd it from microspot. They called me 2 days later to tell me this offer was a error... i had the option to get the money back or buy it at 40.- more. This was my first and last experience with microspot.
Switzerland,2t1xz5,iwonderhowlongmyuse,2,Tue Jan 20 18:23:31 2015 UTC,"In my experience digitec only has the best prices for popular items, with higher margins. When you look at cheaper things, microspot often has better prices. The last few times I bought SD cards, it was from microspot. Sometimes you pay just half the next day delivery fee for the card +  shipping (meaning you pay 4.50 for a card in total, shipping included, which they ship with priority shipping that costs 9.00 theoretically)."
Switzerland,2t1xz5,anonlymouse,1 point,Tue Jan 20 15:52:22 2015 UTC,"Good to know. I've seen them offering the lowest prices for a number of products, I'd rather avoid something like that."

In most cases the price difference isn't that big but Brack has often much more pieces on stock and you can pay per invoice so you don't have to pay credit card / paypal charges or wait for the bank transfer to happen.

Switzerland,2t1xz5,nixietee,1 point,Tue Jan 20 19:49:03 2015 UTC,"Besides the already mentioned local (online)stores, I often buy electronics from the following sources. Especially in recent times, since global e-commerce has increased and when I feel, there is no added value buying a product locally.  Chinese supplier: like Aliexpress Tinydeal Banggood  Bought my last two cellphones directly in China and also some cheap throwaway phones. They ship mostly for free and very 'customs friendly'. ;) They are offering also mini-quadcopters and such toys, which go for a very high price here in Switzerland.  US supplier: like ebay.com Amazon US  With help of a parcel forwarding service, good can be shipped quite cheap to Switzerland. Also customs declaration is filled out by myself online (connect the dots yourself). Usually I use this for things that aren't readily available in Switzerland. So the other day I bought a microphone for 275$ + 20$ shipping, for which I only had one single source here and they offered for 650.- (plus shipping).  If you live close to the border or it's no problem for you to travel there, there is also the option that you buy from ""EU's Ebay"" and send the parcel to a location like this. Then you pick it up and you're responsible for customs, when you enter Switzerland.  There is risks involved when buying goods overseas, especially when it comes to guarantee claims. I'm aware of this risks and so far, I was never disappointed or had faulty good. I try to buy from reliable sources, which have plenty of positive feedback."

I pay attention that the price (including shipping) does not exceed CHF 60, because then all import fees are officially waived.  If you exceed CHF 62, then you will have to pay VAT, customs and a customs handling fee (often you pay on delivery of the package). All of those fees together start around CHF 40.- and go up with the price of the goods (8% VAT). Thos often wipes out the savings of ordering abroad.  Also, as you have seen, prices in Switzerland are quite good, if you shop in the right places."

Make 100% absolutely totally completely sure that you properly fill out the customs sticker on the OUTSIDE of the package.  Put a reasonable-sounding but not-too-high value on it (e.g. $50).  As others have pointed out, they'll only get a big charge if the customs guys decide they want to inspect it, for whatever reason.    DHL/UPS/FedEx/TNT tend to be pretty expensive, and the post office works fine."

Lucerne is much more ""Swiss"" as you would imagine it, also has a larger tourism tradition.

I am assuming that you'll only be there for 90 days when you say 'three months' and not a day more as, if you work for any longer than 90 days, you have to get a residency permit.  Switzerland has dual-tax agreements with many countries, including Ireland, and I believe that you must work in Switzerland for at least 183 days during the financial year before you are liable to pay tax in Switzerland / exempt from paying tax in Ireland."

What I'm wondering is what this means for Swiss people in the long run. Our export industry is going to hurt a lot since the Swiss Franc shot up against any trade partner's currency. So any exports will bring in less wins.  I'm surprised Schiff hardly spoke about the political situation in Europe. I think it's quite important to look at that to figure out where the Euro is going and to explain the SNB's move to not honor the peg. Instead he solely focuses on the Eurozone's monetary policies that he doesn't like and singles that one out as a cause for the change of policy. However, that doesn't explain the timing of the move at all."

Reading articles on Dutch Disease, like for instance about Canada and the increasing exploitation of oil reserves, there is always the logical conclusion that investment in the financial market makes the the currency more worth and the export industries hurt, businesses disappear and unemployment rises. There are tons of examples you can find online and it's always the same pattern.

The CHF went under parity with the $ earlier this week, which was a psychological mark that probably also contributed to the decision.  Now let's just hope our economy will go the way of the US rather than the way of the EU..."
Switzerland,2sludo,silasoverturf,3,Fri Jan 16 20:32:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think Switzerland ""lost"" as far as its international standing in the markets is concerned. Much to the contrary, we showed the EU that we can mess with their fiscal policy quite substantially should we choose to do so.  Now, I highly doubt that played much of a role in the BNS decision, but it's a nice side effect. Definitely puts us in a better position for the next round of bilateral talks."

But the fact remains that in times of crisis Switzerland and the Swiss Franc is seen as a safe haven, rightly so.  The credit crunch might have a short term effect on Switzerland but in the end we will come out ahead."
Switzerland,2sludo,oelsen,1 point,Sun Jan 18 15:46:06 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you are being downvoted. People probably don't know that many banks in Eastern Europe gave out low-interest mortgages in CHF. Lots of creditors will default on their debts, I don't see how this can be good for the CHF."
Switzerland,2sludo,Urgullibl,2,Sat Jan 17 10:26:38 2015 UTC,"Well, it's gonna be bad for the Eastern European banks that gave out those mortgages. They weren't Swiss banks, they were foreign banks that gave out loans in another currency. The Swiss economy doesn't bear any of the risk here.  On the plus side, a mortgage is a secured loan, so that should mitigate the negative effects a bit."
Switzerland,2sludo,tango-01,1 point,Sat Jan 17 20:28:43 2015 UTC,"Who gave those commercial bank the money? The SNB or CS/UBS? When having too much euros is a problem for the SNB, then surely too many failed mortgages/credits are a problem too, right?"
Switzerland,2sludo,Urgullibl,2,Sun Jan 18 15:26:58 2015 UTC,"Not really. What private parties in other countries do with their Swiss Francs after they bought them doesn't really affect the Swiss economy, as it doesn't share in the risk. The people who will default on their mortgages will forfeit their houses to the Polish banks in question, and they will sell them off to get their money back. This has a good chance of affecting the Polish economy, but I don't see how it could affect the Swiss economy."

I'd like to think I'm qualified (or at least will be when I get my diploma). But hard is doable, and I'm willing to try for quite a long time, as I'm not at all worried about finding work here, so I can have stable work while I search.  As for language, I'm learning German as best I can (admittedly, I should spend a bit less time on German, and more on school... ) and I know enough French to get by in day to day conversation."
Switzerland,2smiij,Winkelried,4,Fri Jan 16 13:48:41 2015 UTC,"i think a good way to do this (if you have the means and qualification) is to enroll in a university program in Switzerland on a student visa basis. To my knowledge this visa permits you to stay in CH for 1 year. You will not be allowed to work though (actually, there might be a limit of say 10 hours of work per week or so). But that would give you a year of local job search."

Switzerland,2smiij,Urgullibl,3,Sat Jan 17 02:19:02 2015 UTC,You must know that 3 years of college is basically worth nothing in Switzerland.

You Canadians are way to nice to be subjected to it. Seitgeist is somewhat right, but also talking bull.  Your degree is pretty much the same as the ones done here... it's just that the swiss aren't much into the non swiss so theys make it SUPER difficult workwise.

Switzerland,2smiij,Lejeune_Dirichelet,1 point,Mon Jan 19 13:15:02 2015 UTC,"Just to add another voice to this - Swiss and Canadian culture are pretty superficially compatible, but deeply different. I'll just add a few of the subtle cultural differences which are not apparent unless you have made a concerted effort to join Swiss society.   Be prepared to easily make small talk, understand how banking works, understand expectations of employers, co-workers, etc. Setting up casual nights out, behaviour in public places, etc will be the same as at home. Easy, day-to-day stuff is very similar to Canada. The government is structured differently but your interaction with the beaurocracy will be similar as well.   However, be prepared to radically change your definitions of freindship, fairness, and even family. I can go into this in more detail if you like, but know that connections between Swiss people are formed far more slowly than in Canada and are far more fragile. You will find that people do not feel the obligations towards you that you may feel towards them - in terms of honesty, help out of difficulties, etc. Granted, the french-speaking cantons are more similar to Canada, but it is still difficult to find the level of warmth that, say, a Vancouverite would feel obligated to show a friend-of-a-friend. Maritime-style social life simply does not exist in Switzerland.   Your wife will face a degree of sexism that is unimaginable to Canadians - in my work (at a federal research lab) I routinely witness behaviour that is frankly illegal in Canada. This is at a progressive institute. My wife works at a university here and her situation is worse.   Racism. The word ""immigrant"" is rarely, if ever, used - the preferred nomenclature is ""foriegner"" in German and ""stranger"" in French. Unlike in Canada, even if you gain full-on citizenship, you will never be considered Swiss. The recent debates over immigration can take on a decidedly racist undertone, and even overtone in the case of extreme right wing parties.   Anyways, I live in Switzerland, I married a Swiss woman, and I am basically happy here. However, hapiness has required extreme social adaptation."

As a Swiss-Canadian double national I can tell you might have a very nasty surprise when you see how many assholes live in Switzerland.   Also, it makes more sense if you both stick to one language, as only a few places use French and German simultaneously.  As for work permits or acquiring citizenship, you need to know that each state has VERY different standards, so I suggest you choose accordingly.  Lastly, you need to be aware that the cost of living is SIGNIFICANTLY higher than in Canada, and if you follow the news you might dislike this even more.  Anyway, don't rush a decision like that"

But unfortunately, Swiss' production companies (in generall) make their money with EXPORTs of their high-quality products (e.g. clocks, drugs, specialised machinery, chocolate, medical equipment).

It was tense, especially considering it was a drop from roughly €1.50 to €1, but it didn't put Switzerland into recession, so I think going from €1.20 to €1 or €0.90 will either..."
Switzerland,2si3aq,t0t0zenerd,1 point,Thu Jan 15 15:17:14 2015 UTC,plus it impacts on Swiss internal consumption as a lot of people who live in Switzerland will be crossing the border to buy stuff cheaper in Eurozone countries
Switzerland,2si3aq,elfgoose,1 point,Fri Jan 16 08:54:48 2015 UTC,Well you also get material cheaper from foreign countries and you can invest in your own company. This idea that a strong currency only has negative aspects is so stupid.
Switzerland,2si3aq,pseudoRndNbr,5,Fri Jan 16 17:18:54 2015 UTC,"To expand on this: Not only are the prices going down because of cheaper imports which will put even more pressure on Switzerland's price level, the interest rates will not increase until next year at least. And this is great because the interest is already very low and thus rent is cheap. Furthermore, the negative interest rate for banks will let them give out mortgages more easily as they can't sit on too much cash. This will improve the economy as there is more money for investments.  But, and this is a big but, the export industry, which makes up a big portion of the Swiss economy will likely get hurt. Although they can import the materials much cheaper this won't help as the price for the resources needed are not a big part of the selling price. We have to see what comes out of this. I'm guessing there will be some sort of job loss which can't be in the interest of consumers who are generally profiting from this change. The Swiss market doesn't see a bright future as well as the stock plummeted today. You can check which companies downed most – those will most likely be the ones hit the hardest."
Switzerland,2si3aq,ninoez,3,Thu Jan 15 18:23:19 2015 UTC,But the average Swiss worker may lose on this when he becomes too expensive and his employer decides to move his job abroad.

Switzerland,2si3aq,shinnen,25,Fri Jan 16 04:00:39 2015 UTC,"It feels like this came a bit unannounced...   There's the idea in central banking economics that monetary policy has to be unanticipated to be effective because anticipated policy changes will have already been taken into account in economic behaviour and will therefore not evoke any further effect.  The same idea was used to hold the lower bound in the first place. If people anticipate the SNB to hold a lower bound of 1.2 no matter what, then they don't even try to buy/sell at a lower rate and the SNB doesn't have to do anything at all. Worked quite well this time.  More information and some empirical evidence showing that this idea might not hold always can be found here.   Did anybody know this would happen?   Judging from the stock markets... No, seems like their all redoing their forecasts.  On the other hand, did we really expect the SNB to hold the lower bound no matter what happens to the Euro? We knew this couldn't go on forever but we didn't knew when it becomes infeasible."
Switzerland,2si3aq,electrodraco,3,Thu Jan 15 13:58:20 2015 UTC,"There's the idea in central banking economics that monetary policy has to be unanticipated   True, but normally the changes aren't that sudden.

Switzerland,2si3aq,ElLocoAbogado,2,Fri Jan 16 11:18:52 2015 UTC,"Short answer: they could, but not without risking permanent loss of control of the Franc and hyperinflation.  A central bank has a balance sheet, just like any bank. On the SNB balance sheet, issued francs count as a liability. These liabilities are offset by assets (such as loans to private banks and foreign currency reserves). If liabilities greatly outweigh assets, the central bank becomes insolvent and a risk exists that the currency will fall in value. Since the SNB can't really buy francs by issuing francs, this is a potential disaster.  Right now about half the SNB assets are in Euros, and to maintain the peg it would need to continue buying Euros, even as the likely rate of return on these European bonds nears or surpasses zero. If inflation later occurred the SNB would have to sell Euros to buy francs, but this would drive down the value of the Euro, further depleting the balance sheet."

Switzerland,2s9fy9,xamdk,18,Tue Jan 13 11:59:35 2015 UTC,"As an American who recently moved to Switzerland, this outlook by the Swiss always makes me chuckle.  Everything is regulated down to a science that things just work.  To say ""you simply just train your dog to not be aggressive"" is very Swiss. In the US, training a dog to behave like that is not common.  Of course there are dog owners who take the responsibility seriously, but I would guess they are quite a minority.  Dogs in public are seen more like wild animals. FWIW, I brought a dog here from the states and we are currently in the process of enrolling him in ""Hundschule,"" which is required by federal law within 1 year of bringing the dog into the country."

Dogs have been bred for hundreds of years to fulfill a certain purpose, of course they're going to be genetically inclined to do that.  Would you argue that Labradors retrieving or Border Collies herding is just because of their owners?"
Switzerland,2s9fy9,Urgullibl,2,Fri Jan 16 06:24:57 2015 UTC,"No, but a dog of herding breed won't just automatically become a good herder if it is not exposed to herds to herd.  A breed that got very good biting jaws don't get aggressive if you shower it with love and structure as opposed to suppression and cruelty."
Switzerland,2s9fy9,xamdk,1 point,Fri Jan 16 06:30:42 2015 UTC,"A dog of a herding breed will automatically try to herd things, even if it won't be very good at it. That's what you work with to try and make them good.  You try taking a sighthound and make it good at herding. I'll pay to watch."
Switzerland,2s9fy9,Urgullibl,2,Fri Jan 16 06:38:22 2015 UTC,"You just made my point. The human is the one that makes it follow its instinct and become good.   I'm pretty sure I can make even the happiest and peaceful dog aggressive too.   Sure some easier to make aggressive than others. But that's my point - you, us the owners are the one that make the true difference here."
Switzerland,2s9fy9,xamdk,0,Fri Jan 16 07:34:13 2015 UTC,"No. We take a potential that's the result of hundreds of years of selection and work with it. There simply are dogs that will turn aggressive in an environment where others will not, and that propensity is genetic.  Compare e.g. fatal dog bites in North America, where Pitbull-type dogs make up 5% of the population and account for half of all fatal bite incidents, while Greyhounds make up 2% and account for exactly zero. Both of these breeds are mostly bred in shady circumstances and have fairly shitty owners, yet only one of them is made aggressive by it.  Again, put a sighthound and a herding dog with a flock of whatever. The herding dog will try and herd them, the sighthound will chase and kill them, and you'll never make the latter into a reliable herder. It's what their genetics dictate."
Switzerland,2s9fy9,Urgullibl,2,Fri Jan 16 16:20:48 2015 UTC,"I never at any point said genetics did not have an impact. I said it is up to the dog owner to make the best/right thing out of the dog.

Switzerland,2s9fy9,xamdk,0,Fri Jan 16 17:47:18 2015 UTC,"No, you said that the owner can overcome genetics. The owner can modify genetics in some cases, but they can't overcome them.

Switzerland,2s9fy9,Urgullibl,1 point,Fri Jan 16 20:01:58 2015 UTC,Which is what I said. The owner is the one to do the right thing to make it right. Of course he need to adjust his training to the type/mentality of the dog.

(Not a dog owner, so I can't be more specific)."

I've been raising dogs for 25 years so the trainer told me over the phone if I had a vaccination card of similar proof I could skip it. Raised my current dog from puppy but because he was technically under someone else's name (ex-roomate's dog) for a good chunk of the time I was supposed to do the training stuff.

Switzerland,2s6c4m,TheMaskedTom,5,Mon Jan 12 19:02:37 2015 UTC,"very backwards    That's quite the overstatement. Switzerland is a bit backwards, but there are very many countries where lgbtqi have much less rights and worse lifes."
Switzerland,2s6c4m,P1r4nha,4,Tue Jan 13 10:13:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/Grilled_Bear here. We may not have a lot of legal advances about LGBT, but as far as I know, there a few restrictions, little discrimination and most of all... yeah, it's Switzerland. Don't expect the law to go quicker than turtle pace, whatever the subject is...  How many countries recognize the third gender?"
Switzerland,2s6c4m,nuephelkystikon,3,Tue Jan 13 13:09:38 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I don't see a lgbtqi rights movement in Switzerland at all. Not in the media, not among my gay friends or family members etc. If there is a movement, it's not very visible. I don't know if it gets suppressed by the media or if they just rather live comfortably or don't want to make any big waves.  And I got to say I'm surprised when I look at the movements in other countries."
Switzerland,2s6c4m,drsmaug,4,Mon Jan 12 19:39:58 2015 UTC,"Switzerland is a very backwards in terms of lgbtqi rights.   Including marriage and adoption being explicitly forbidden for same-sex couples, trans people being registered according to the sex of their body instead of their own gender, and so on.  With the church losing power and higher education becoming more common, however, Swiss society has recently been seeing some progress in that respect. As with anything in Switzerland, it will need a lot of patience to see it through, but it will be done eventually. After all, we also managed to introduce women's suffrage a few years ago."
Switzerland,2s6c4m,nuephelkystikon,3,Mon Jan 12 20:06:38 2015 UTC,"Actually same-sex marriages are allowed, they're called civil partnerships and the only (admittedly important) difference to a heterosexual marriage is indeed the fact that they can't adopt children. Everything else from property sharing to taxes to choices of last names is the same.  Also with regards to recognizing trans people, you are allowed to legally have your gender changed if you are in hormonal therapy and/or undergoing sex reassignment surgery.  (source: http://www.transgender-network.ch/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012_02_01_EAZW_Kein-Operationszwang.pdf)  Interestingly, married couples where one member is trans and undergoes a legal sex change can have their marriage turned into a civil partnership, and vice versa. Which means that legally a same sex couple where one member is trans and who undergoes sex reassignement can turn their civil partnership into a heterosexual marriage, and therefore adopt children.  Which is pretty damn forward, if you ask me."
Switzerland,2s6c4m,drsmaug,3,Tue Jan 13 06:30:23 2015 UTC,"Actually same-sex marriages are allowed, they're called civil partnerships   And they are called that way because they are very explicitly not marriages. Even if they were functionally equivalent, it would still be like ""Women aren't allowed to vote, but they can give a 'female recommendation' that counts as a vote. It's functionally equal, but we obviously can't call it a vote because, you know, they're still women.""   you are allowed to legally have your gender changed if you are in hormonal therapy and/or undergoing sex reassignment surgery   That's what I said: You are registered according to your body's sex, not your gender. If you want to be considered to be of your actual gender (assuming it doesn't happen to conform to the legal default mapping), you'll actually have to modify your body by surgery so its sex will change accordingly. Not everybody wants that."
Switzerland,2s6c4m,nuephelkystikon,1 point,Mon Jan 12 20:15:23 2015 UTC,"Ok I see your point. But with regards to having one's gender legally changed, I repeat that it's ""sufficient"" to be in hormonal therapy without having undergone or even having to undergo surgery.   Now I might be very ignorant on the subject but I was under the impression that to legally be identified as another gender than one's biological sex, people had to prove that they were taking steps to transition into their identified gender. You're saying that it's possible to not undergo any physical transition and be legally identified as being of the other sex in some countries?"
Switzerland,2s6c4m,acfprongu,0,Tue Jan 13 22:00:22 2015 UTC,"You're saying that it's possible to not undergo any physical transition and be legally identified as being of the other sex in some countries?   Of course it is. I don't know the details for each country by heart, but I know for sure that e.g. Great Britain doesn't require surgery or hormonal therapy (as of the Gender Recognition Act of 2004). The condition is instead that you have lived as your self-perceived gender for at least two years.  And while it may not be a popular opinion, I think a law that requires you to undergo surgery or take hormon pills because you're ""different"" isn't appropriate anymore in the 21st century."
Switzerland,2s6c4m,nuephelkystikon,0,Tue Jan 13 23:37:29 2015 UTC,"trans people being registered according to the sex of their body instead of their own gender   How is that such a problem? Your genes wont just change if you are transgender and people are also registered in order to be able to fight crime thus the registered sex should be the sex that can be found in your genome. If it's too offensive to write male or female on an ID then there must be found an alternative e.g. instead using the Allosomes (the gender defining chromosomes) XX and XY to indicate of which genome a person is.   With the church losing power and higher education becoming more common, however, Swiss society has recently been seeing some progress in that respect.   I don't think that's part of the problem. Most of the conservative people I know (xenophobe, SVP friendly) surprisingly had no problems with lgbt, they seem to accept those quite well. I think the problem is that first off there is no big lbgt-rights movement that has publicity and manages to do much in Switzerland and that most people just don't care  enough to discuss it a lot.    it will need a lot of patience to see it through, but it will be done eventually.   I can only agree with that.  All in all I think (like many others here) that saying Switzerland is very backwards in relations to the lgbt community is an overstatement. there's truth in it but it's not factual correct and this statement:   So far the only conclusive and correct answer, and it's being downvoted because it doesn't portray Switzerland as perfect.   That's plain stupid and just as ignorant as hating lgbt."

Switzerland,2s5cbz,T3chnopsycho,12,Mon Jan 12 13:11:22 2015 UTC,Well the thing is that these threads pop up here every other day about someone wanting to move here. Pretty much everything here has been covered by an earlier thread on this subreddit.
Switzerland,2s5cbz,P1r4nha,-2,Mon Jan 12 13:25:22 2015 UTC,"I had that feeling but I wasn't bothered to look them up, sadly."
Switzerland,2s5cbz,therealsam,3,Mon Jan 12 14:36:08 2015 UTC,I'll jump up on this here.  Like /u/Dw0 said high German is OK but you will still have difficulty understanding the various Swiss German dialects. And yes the German is the major language followed by French then Italian and the Rumantsch.   Yes our direct democracy is actively used. We have around 2-4 voting days per year where we vote about new laws or changes of current laws (Initiative / Referendum). If you are interested to take part you will have to have Swiss citizenship though (I don't know the exact requirements for that though).   Healthcare is the same over all of Switzerland but the Cantons can have certain varying laws (e.g. time where you are allowed to sell alcohol is until 10 in Zurich but only until 9 in Geneva). Generally as long as it doesn't contradict the Swiss federal constitution a canton can make whatever laws he wants to. The biggest variations you will notice are regarding taxes. While the tax on good is the same over the whole of Switzerland income and asset taxes vary between cantons as well as between the different municipalities. If you have more questions just ask :)
Switzerland,2s5cbz,Vazoo,5,Mon Jan 12 15:03:48 2015 UTC,"Since the majority of speakers speak German(don't they?), would it suffice for me to study the high-german that is spoken in germany to understand the german spoken in Switzerland? or is it best to immediately adapt to the dialect?   Yes, most speak German. The dialects are quite different from High-German, but most written things (so letters, signs, menus in restaurants etc.) are written in High-German. Dialect will only help you to integrate better into society by speaking. All Swiss Germans speak High-German though, even though some of us might not like it so much.   How does the government of Switzerland work? Do these cantons make any difference over for example health care?   Health care insurances are private. Their prices are different in each canton, probably even in each city. We use Comparis to check which insurance is the cheapest in the location we live. The coverage is standardized nationally. Other than this I don't think there is any significant difference between the cantons when it comes to health care.   Schools, taxes and many laws are different in each canton (see Federalism). Most noticeable are the different tax rates, otherwise the cantons' laws are similar enough that you won't get bad surprises."
Switzerland,2s5cbz,MrRSterling,3,Mon Jan 12 09:12:14 2015 UTC,"I don't speak German, but there is a difference I've experienced between cantons for healthcare. Only applies if you are a foreign student, though."
Switzerland,2s5cbz,P1r4nha,2,Mon Jan 12 14:02:50 2015 UTC,"You will be able to communicate well in high german, as you'll find that people will switch to it if they notice that you aren't very familiar with dialect yet. As for understanding a conversation in the local language, depending on the dialect in question this will take some time. Many germans can't understand a swiss conversation very well either. Especially in the more ""exotic"" regions like from Wallis and Graubünden. But if you spend some time with swiss people you'll probably learn it quite quickly."
Switzerland,2s5cbz,P1r4nha,2,Mon Jan 12 09:12:49 2015 UTC,"Here go can see a map of all the language regions of switzerland. So what language you need to learn depends on where you want to live, as french won't help you in the german part and vice versa. Studying high german makes sense as it may even be required for certain jobs. Keep in mind that the dialects are only speaking languages and all written stuff is done in high german, so you'll need that one way or the other.   For future questions it might be helpful to give some information on what you want to do in switzerland (study/work/live?)"
Switzerland,2s5cbz,Xorondras,1 point,Mon Jan 12 10:06:26 2015 UTC,I intend to work there if work is available in my field. Preferably with a high percentage of the population who can speak high-german (looking for suggestions here) and a generally nice community.  This might be a longshot but I'm also not a very faithful person so a canton with a higher percentage of atheist/agnostics might ease my living there.
Switzerland,2s5cbz,futurespice,5,Mon Jan 12 12:32:13 2015 UTC,"I'm from Zürich and I think you gonna like it here. The city is small, but international enough that it is an international community and it's probably easier to meet the people you want to meet.  Also there are tons of Germans here, so not being able to speak dialect (or even High-German) won't be as much of a problem.  Last but not least, it's the most urban place in Switzerland next to Geneva I'd say and urban places are less religious than the rural ones. They are also less conservative. So if you're left leaning politically, you will find more like-minded people in cities or the French part of Switzerland.  So hearing your description of yourself I think Zürich might be for you. I'm sure there are other places though which you might like."
Switzerland,2rzi65,PumpkinSpiceWhatever,3,Sat Jan 10 19:07:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah. What they ^ said.  Basel is a good city, but if being near family is important, know that it's probably 4 hours away from most big cities in Europe."

You shouldn't have trouble finding English speaking work in Basel and surrounding area.   I would say go for it."
Switzerland,2rzi65,shinnen,2,Sun Jan 11 11:17:05 2015 UTC,"Well, asking people that live in Switzerland whether you should live in Switzerland might not be the way to objective answers, but I'm on my second year here, and I love it. Beautiful nature, well functioning and peaceful society, some of the highest life quality to be found.  There is the language challenge, of course, but pretty much anywhere interesting you can move will have some of that. And it's not like it'd be a permanent decision. So if I were you, I'd go for it."
Switzerland,2rzi65,mikkelhoegh,2,Sun Jan 11 01:35:10 2015 UTC,"If you move to Switzerland to study, yeah, otherwise stay away until your late 20s or hit the 30 mark. Reason being that there aren't a lot of entry positions in Switzerland, nor are there any ""sexy"" ecommerce companies (if that's your thing, it's mine so when i moved here I was slightly disappointed). Once you have some solid experience you can make a fair bit of money in middle management or as an expert in a new field. The swiss are generally slow to fix what isn't broke so you could specialize in cloud computing for 3- years and the really reap those rewards here later, because decision makers won't update to it for another few years."
Switzerland,2rzi65,polaroid_kidd,1 point,Sun Jan 11 02:06:39 2015 UTC,Reason being that there aren't a lot of entry positions in Switzerland   This is not true. However - it's harder to get an entry-level position as a fresh graduate if you do not speak the local language. Which should not be a surprise as it's the same the world over.  Academia is a different story; there the language should be less of an issue.
Switzerland,2rzi65,futurespice,1 point,Sun Jan 11 09:44:38 2015 UTC,"I am usually not the argumentative type but in this case I have to make an exception. Entry positions here read ""recent graduate with minimum 3 years experience"". Otherwise you are applying to positions which read along the lines of ""business development intern with sales experience"" which translates to cold-calling. I have lived outside of CH to get my foot in the door with companies and have experienced it far easier. Also, there is a large need to certificates here. If you can clean a toilet, you better have a diploma certifying that you can clean toilets (this is especially annoying in the IT sector)."
Switzerland,2rzi65,polaroid_kidd,1 point,Sun Jan 11 16:02:14 2015 UTC,"That was not my experience after graduation - in fact I can't recall any such positions. My company certainly doesn't require any experience for entry-level, although it's a a plus.  I just took quick look and found any number of junior developer positions which didn't require any experience or indeed much beyond knowing a programming language and having a degree or apprenticeship. What king of entry-level positions require 3 years experience?"
Switzerland,2rzi65,futurespice,1 point,Sat Jan 17 12:02:57 2015 UTC,To be fair I wasn't looking at coding positions. I'm more of a business man than a coding man myself. Maybe that's where the difference comes from? The positions I was looking at at the time were all in the financial field.
Switzerland,2rzi65,polaroid_kidd,1 point,Sat Jan 17 12:59:56 2015 UTC,"I recall applying to entry level jobs in that area as well - there were definitely junior business analyst positions that didn't require prior experience. I think maybe some support as well, although I wasn't looking for that.  And consulting will hire anyone with a pulse and a few brain cells."

Switzerland,2rrzhh,LeSpatula,5,Thu Jan 8 20:07:57 2015 UTC,"Not really an answer to your question but I asked a dentist acquaintance about this once - the whole CH vs DE and HU - and as always: it depends. She said that (in HU) the more invasive the procedure the more complications arise - apparently more than they would at a local shop because treatments cannot be spread out over time. So if you rip out some teeth, get some bleaching and some dental prosthetics it might not be a good idea. Then again, she might be biased.  Price wise, it seems legit - sometimes I feel we're the only dumb fucks who pay 1+k for root canal treatment. Seriously, look it up in Germany."
Switzerland,2rrzhh,hubraum,3,Thu Jan 8 23:06:35 2015 UTC,"Id say it really depends on what you're going to get there.. for normal dental work (i.e. fixing a single tooth) it doesn't even really pay to go to Germany unless you're really close to the border or going there anyway. In general, you will get the same quality of service at a lower price (and there are good and bad docs everywhere, be it Zurich or Freiburg i.Br. or Budapest - there is no ""Swiss Quality"" in medical care, really), so get a quote and see for yourself."

Switzerland,2rrzhh,swissmike,1 point,Thu Jan 8 22:16:57 2015 UTC,"as a hungarian i can confirm, that dental tourism is a blooming geschäft in Hungary. you can see a lots of tourists (mostly from Austria and Germany) coming to Hungary (via plane or bus), having a good time, having dinner, and after that they let their teeth fixed. there might be some scam advertisements too, so ask around before going on a dental trip.  dental service is much cheaper in Hungary, than in any other EU state. if you combine it with a casual sightseeing it can be a nice experience.  the best you can do from Switzerland is to head for Sopron. its right next the Austrian border. it is one of the biggest dental capitals in Hungary, with dentists on every corner, im sure you can find the fitting one for you.  other places with dental hotels  scanidinavian opinion  googled dental tourism in Sopron, the first result"

Switzerland,2rmj01,atlantic,4,Wed Jan 7 19:25:18 2015 UTC,As a Swiss living abroad it confirms my impression that Switzerland only changes very slowly.
Switzerland,2rmj01,LordAmras,2,Wed Jan 7 16:41:27 2015 UTC,"From the '70 to today Switzerland grew from 6 million to the current 8 million.  2 millions might seems small but is a 33% incrase. It's just that most of our country is on hills and mountains, and not very accessible, so countryside tend to stay there and only the more urban areas tend to change and grow."
Switzerland,2rmj01,YeaISeddit,8,Wed Jan 7 17:36:17 2015 UTC,"33% isn't a very big increase. The world population has increased 200% in that time. The city I was born in in the US, Miami, has increased in population 300% since 1970 from 1.89 to 5.6 million. And that's in an area less than half the canton Bern. I don't see the population increase in Switzerland as being that big a deal."
Switzerland,2rmj01,LordAmras,7,Wed Jan 7 18:07:28 2015 UTC,"In Europe from 1970 to today:  Italy 54M-59M / +9%  France 52M-66M / +26%  Germany 78M-80M / +2.5%  Austria 7.5M-8.5M / +13%  Only France has a % comparable to ours. Of course is not comparable to a big metropoly that has double our whole popolation in one city, just saying that it has changed quite a bit from the 70' but you won't see that big change in a small rural area.  Edit: Just because I was checking to get the other countries data, it doesn't actually change your point at all World population from 1970 to today is a 100% increase from 3.5b to 7.1b"
Switzerland,2rmj01,YeaISeddit,1 point,Wed Jan 7 20:48:51 2015 UTC,"Whoops, that's what happens when you try to do math in your head. I guess I can see how a 33% increase could be a problem. The population is also getting a lot more spread out. Basel Stadt's population is currently around the same level it was in the 1940s. It reached its peek in the 1970s at 213,000 and is now around 167,000 (source). Obviously this is because people are moving to Baselland. Sprawl is an issue no matter what the population is. But, this is not necessarily caused by immigration."
Switzerland,2rmj01,DeepDuh,2,Thu Jan 8 10:02:51 2015 UTC,"Didn't the trend reverse lately, as in more people move to the cities again?"
Switzerland,2rmj01,YeaISeddit,1 point,Thu Jan 8 12:37:37 2015 UTC,"Could be. I couldn't find any recent census figures. Urbanization is a global trend. People under 30 years old around the world want to live in urban centers. Switzerland has astoundingly low new residential inventory in its city centers, though. Almost all the new construction is in the suburbs. Again using Basel Stadt as an example since it encompasses just the city center, typically around 200 new residences are built in Basel Stadt per year. Some years more are demolished than built (source). It will take 100 years for Basel Stadt to get to its 1970 value unless zoning laws are changed to allow for taller buildings. Too much space is now taken up by commerce."
Switzerland,2rmj01,DeepDuh,1 point,Thu Jan 8 12:49:55 2015 UTC,I'm thinking Basel Stadt is a bit of a special case because it failed to grow its city limits during or after industrialization (strict separation Stadt / Land). This seems to be turning into a big problem there.

Ironically, again, the local government asked for an exception of this law for tourists (arabian tourists tend to spend money in expensive stuff), therefore making this law nil."

In some cities (like Zurich where I am), to be a High School (as in gymnase) teacher, the courses for the teaching diploma are at the University, not the ""Pädagogische Hochschule""/""Haute Ecole Pédagogique"". I don't know how it is in the Romandie.   Ok, so here goes what you have to do in Switzerland normally, to be a Gymnasiallehrer/Prof de gymnase: You will have to do a masters degree in the field you would like to teach. It can also be two different matters - but then you would probably have to make sure you have taken enough courses/seminars/credit points in the second field too. For instance, I studied French and History, both are taught in Gymnase. Sometimes you can also teach in a field related to the one you studied but then you may have to take additional courses/credits.  THEN: In a second step (the two can overlap though) you have to get a Gymnase teacher's diploma. This is called ""Lehrdiplom für Maturitätsschulen"" at my University. Maybe, if you are sure you would like to teach in Switzerland and stay here, it would be easier to do this diploma here too. You are allowed to start teaching before you have the diploma (everybody does it, it is even recommended) and the salary is good also then (at least in my canton). You can even start to teach before you have your first degree. I did that and for me, it was a good experience.  What might have caused some of the confusion you encountered: things might vary between cantons quite a bit. As I told you, in between cantons you don't get the teacher's diploma at the same kind of school - for instance: University in Zurich, Pädagogische Hochschule (in french HEP) in Berne or Kreuzlingen. But what is sure (with maybe a few exceptions) is that the masters degree has to be one of a University or equivalent, not of a type of school called ""Fachhochschule"" here (don't even know the term in French but could check for you).   If you have further questions feel free. I am happy to help if I can. Also, I speak French even though I don't live in the French speaking part of Switzerland.   edit: I just read the other comment. I don't agree with it. But I must say: depending on the field you would be applying for, it will be difficult to get a job. History for instance... My husband is a historian (main field of his studies). He didn't get a job as a history teacher and I know of others who struggled (he teaches something else now but of course had to take additional credits).  English, I don't know. Probably more difficult than math or french but hopefully feasible.  May I ask a few questions:   What is tesol? What is celta? It would probably better to do the master in English and History, not education. A bachelor degree will not be enough. Did I understand well that you will only have a master in education?"
Switzerland,2rdyse,ugottabekiddinme,4,Mon Jan 5 12:22:13 2015 UTC,"okay,I have a computer now. So, I understand all the confusion now. As far as I understand, I need to teach two subjects and, as I already have a BA in English and History, I might as well do teach that.   In Ireland, where I'm from, you can't do a masters in two subjects, only one, so I'm confused on how that would equate to Switzerland. Switzerland recognises my degree under the Bologna process, so it has to be feasible to study in Ireland for the masters, even ifit would be better in Switzerland.   Tesol is an MA which focuses on the development of English language teaching. It's typically what one does if one is an ESL/EFL teacher.  CELTA is a worldwide accredited certificate to teach English to adults and children. I have 16 months experience of English language teaching already.  Can I study my masters in a Swiss university through English?   I haven't decided what masters to do. I didn't expect an English masters to be useful if I will only be teaching the language, because in English speaking countries a masters in English is only literature.   One last question, if I can indeed study in Switzerland for my masters, is university particularly expensive in Switzerland?"
Switzerland,2rdyse,ugottabekiddinme,2,Mon Jan 5 17:21:55 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Ok, I understand a bit more now.  I don't want to bum you out. But to teach English in High School you will have to have done courses in linguistics too besides of literature. I am sure you can do that also afterwards (you will probably also have to do that to complete what would be required for a bachelor I am afraid) but it will be more work. I understand that you have much more knowledge in literature than a Swiss student - but yeah, linguistics is still required... Mayyybe you can try to have some of the extra literature credits count for your masters here. Would be quite a bit of luck if they accepted though. (But one can always ask.)  Yes, in Switzerland it is possible to do a masters in two fields. It's what I have done although in the system before Bologna. But even now it is possible (and common). You will have a main subject and one or two secondary subjects. Not sure about the terminology of it in English or French. It is also possible now to have two main subjects I think.  It is normal for future teachers to get the teaching diploma for two matters. But it can also be done for only one.   It might be an option for you to come to Switzerland directly to do your masters in English and History (bonus would be an improvement of your French). Then you can still decide if you want to get the diploma for one or two matters. As I mentioned in another comment, getting a job as a History teacher is really tough.   I am not sure if it would be possible to only study English. I think a second field of study will be mandatory, but I am not sure...  University is not that expensive in Switzerland, it's the rest of the costs that sum up quickly... University is around 800CHF per semester I think (not sure if it is different for foreigners but don't think so). But as I said, the living costs are quite high compared to other countries."
Switzerland,2rdyse,ugottabekiddinme,2,Mon Jan 5 17:44:46 2015 UTC,"great, thanks for clearing a lot of things up. I'm planning on working as an english language teaher while I study, so if I live frugally, I should be able to manage. Would I have to go private if I wanted to study through English? I don't expect to have a c2 for at least 3 years"
Switzerland,2rdyse,ugottabekiddinme,2,Mon Jan 5 18:10:31 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean by private? Attending a private school? I would say, don't do that. I think it is different from other countries but the best Universities in Switzerland are public - at least for your fields. And probably you would have troubles to be accepted for the studies for the actual teaching diploma.  What do you mean by studying through English exactly? Studying English alone?   At what level are your French skills atm? You might be able to study in French. Check if there are language courses at the Universities you are considering.   Out of curiosity: What's the reason you want to come to Switzerland?"
Switzerland,2rdyse,rolfisrolf,2,Mon Jan 5 18:28:55 2015 UTC,"I mean study the material through my native language, English. My French isn't good at all right now, I'm only preparing for a2,so there's no way I could study through French.   I would imagine there's the possibility to study through the English language in a private school.   I want to learn French and German, and also the quality of life is good, and I like snow sports, and I'm also an English teacher, something we have too much of in Ireland"
Switzerland,2rdyse,TheMaskedTom,2,Mon Jan 5 18:43:21 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, now I understand. I fear that there are not many if any private schools which offer a University level of studies in your fields. At least none that I know of. There might be a public school where it is possible to study through English. But I only know of the ETH but it quite specialized and has completely different programs than what you are interested in (science like in physics, math, etc.).   Yeah, you're right. A2 is not enough to study through French. Maybe it would be a possibility to come here and invest the first year in the improvement of your French and in the first few credits you have to take for your English studies. But actually... I don't know... It might be better to complete your master in English in Ireland and move to Switzerland then. But if I understood well you wouldn't be able to do English and History for your master there? Tricky...  Or what the other commenter suggested... Doing the master in another country. Idk sorry. ;)  Probably you will have to invest a day or two to look more into the programs of different schools and the conditions to get there or also the conditions to do the Swiss teaching diploma after the master in different schools. Because it varies so much from school to school it is difficult to give advice I guess because most people know only the programs of their own University/HEP. At least that's the case for me. (I'm here if you have further questions you think I can answer though.)"
Switzerland,2rdyse,I_Am_Genesis,1 point,Mon Jan 5 20:02:43 2015 UTC,"I think you'd have better luck in Germany or Sweden doing a Master's degree in English than in Switzerland, unless I am mistaken and Switzerland offers a lot of programmes in English? Also, I think you would pay slightly more (but not much) than a Swiss for tuition if you do study in Switzerland.   As for the CELTA, that is more valued in the countries in Europe where EFL teaching is more in demand, such as Poland and Czech. If you plan to be an EFL teacher in Switzerland it will be difficult due to lack of jobs/strong competition/employment that is not stable."
Switzerland,2rdyse,ugottabekiddinme,2,Mon Jan 5 19:18:33 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit late to the party, but most universities are more expensive for foreigners, even though they are still quite affordable. In Fribourg, for example, it is 805 (per semester) instead of 655 CHF."

Switzerland,2rdyse,mixblast,4,Mon Jan 5 15:00:36 2015 UTC,"It depends a lot on the cantons actually. For example a high school teacher who studied in Geneva can't teach in Vaud, but the reverse is possible (go figure...)  Basically you need a Master's degree in your field (they accept Bachelor for math due to shortage), plus a couple years in the pedagogical school (called HEP in Vaud, IUFE in Geneva, etc.)  For example, in Vaud : http://www.vd.ch/themes/formation/espace-enseignants/postuler/dans-lenseignement-postobligatoire/ (see first linked PDF).  You will be expected to be quite fluent in french, I think C2 would be required.  Good luck!"
Switzerland,2rdyse,ugottabekiddinme,-17,Mon Jan 5 12:43:58 2015 UTC,"They don't want you here, believe me. I think speaking German (or French, or whatever depending on the region) is a must. Be prepared for EXTREME cuntiness though."
Switzerland,2rdyse,TranscendentalX,6,Mon Jan 5 12:11:02 2015 UTC,"Wow, why are you saying that? Especially if they want to teach English it can be a plus that they actually are a native speaker. And they said they speak French (which, I agree, is important, doesn't have to be perfect though))."

Seriously though OP, don't consider moving here unless you can speak the local language fluently as well.. and even that isn't good enough, since the people here have their own 'special' dialect that isn't mutually intelligible. You will be treated like a second class citizen no matter what you do."
Switzerland,2rdyse,skleronom,6,Mon Jan 5 12:35:32 2015 UTC,"I am sorry that you don't feel welcomed. May I suggest you take your own attitude into consideration? I like to interact with people from abroad very much... But people coming off as rude as you are... Let's say, my pleasure to meet you will be lowered.  I find it a bit strange too to move to a country without the motivation to learn the local language. For me (as for my friends), it doesn't have to be perfect and doesn't have to be Swiss German. I will happily switch to High German or to English to communicate. But I once met a guy who had been in Switzerland since two years and he was barely able to say ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" in any of our national languages... That's weird, isn't it? English is a foreign language for us - I find it strange when people think that we HAVE to speak it with them but on the other hand don't want to learn our language. Also, not every Swiss person speaks English well.  As for the dialects: I assume you are speaking of the Swiss German ones. This doesn't concern OP so much because he wants to move to the Romandie. The Swiss French doesn't vary much from canton to canton. The Swiss German though does vary... but it is mostly perfectly mutually intelligible. Don't know what you are talking about. People must really come from deep down Valais/Wallis or Graubünden for me to not understand them. And even then, it is mostly only for a few words."
Switzerland,2rdyse,ugottabekiddinme,-8,Mon Jan 5 12:42:42 2015 UTC,"OK first of all nobody said anything about forcing you to speak English, so I think you're projecting a little bit. I speak all of your official languages (except Romansch) so that's clearly not the problem here. I also try to be very polite to everyone although most of the time all I get in response is bile. The problem is that if you're not Swiss here, you're shit. Speaking Hochdeutsch and being American are 2 strikes against you automatically no matter how you act towards others. Btw, Swiss German is NOT intelligible for someone who doesn't speak German natively.  Anyway, your attitude doesn't surprise me in the least; blaming anyone else but yourself  (especially ausländer) for the problem. I've never once seen a Swiss person take responsibility for his mistake- it's always ""well, you should have told me!"" or some other trite bullshit. Sorry, I know it sucks to hear negative feedback about your country, but go ask any foreigner and they'll tell you the exact same thing.   You guys are not hospitable. Don't pretend like you are."
Switzerland,2rdyse,TranscendentalX,6,Mon Jan 5 14:03:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, it's cool if you speak all our languages. As for Swiss German: you said ""mutually intelligible"". I know that it is difficult to understand for someone who only speaks High German. But you can't be serious if you blame us for it. I don't blame you for the fact that English is still difficult for me. It's just the way it is.  As for your second paragraph. I don't understand what is going on honestly. To me it just sounds like rambling.  Anyways you very much seem to be a troll to me. I am only responding so that OP sees that we are not all the way you describe us."
Switzerland,2rdyse,TranscendentalX,5,Mon Jan 5 15:07:03 2015 UTC,"Wow what the hell did you experience when you visited Switzerland. It must have been a nightmare! For what it's worth I have never seen anyone being treated badly because they tried to speak any of our languages. I also find it stupid when people in here advise people to never even try to talk a few words in a dialect because a foreigner saying ""Grüezi"" is cringy.    @OP I suspect teaching history will not be possible without a C2 in French. At least I can't imagine a school choosing you instead of someone that can speak it on the level of a local. Unless of course you are applying for a school where they teach in English."
Switzerland,2rdyhx,Vipix94,7,Mon Jan 5 09:14:35 2015 UTC,"It depends a bit on the canton which language you learn - but yes, everyone has to learn another of the official languages in school. And English. I think by now, English is mandatory everywhere too."
Switzerland,2rdyhx,ugottabekiddinme,4,Mon Jan 5 12:59:45 2015 UTC,And German is mandatory until high school in the French speaking part. Then in high school you can decide to learn Italian instead.

Switzerland,2rdyhx,Iylivarae,2,Mon Jan 5 09:34:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answers, so the conclusion is that even in Switzerland, you need to learn other official languages too. Well, there goes my argument against learning Swedish."

Momentarily it's unclear how the situation will be in a few years due to some recent votes.   I've heard university is exceptional but expensive, is it possible for foreigners to get student loans?   University is really cheap if you compare it to the US. You pay less than 1000 CHF / semester. Currently it's the same for everyone. It might become more expensive for foreigners in the future.   I was thinking about going to Geneva or somewhere in the french speaking part of Switzerland because my german ist nicht gut.

There's two good universities and imo it's a nicer city than Geneva anyway.   Is the rent expensive in big cities? (I'm guessing it's on par with paris)   I don't know about the rent in Paris, but yes, living in the center of a major Swiss city is on the expensive side.

Realistically speaking, this is highly unlikely to change anytime soon.   I've heard university is exceptional but expensive, is it possible for foreigners to get student loans?   University is cheaper than in the US, but more expensive than in France. Depending on your university and what you study, tuition can go up to ~2000 CHF per semester in the medical professions; however, most other subjects are cheaper.  Talk to your university about the possibility of obtaining financial aid (""stipendium"").

Long enough that military service won't be something you'll have to think about by the time you obtain citizenship.   I hear people make good money there and the the taxes are low so this makes living there all the more interesting.   That is generally correct.

Switzerland,2rf3w4,crispybacon404,5,Mon Jan 5 21:27:31 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what other citizenships OP holds, being a US citizen is what counts. Most Swiss banks will have you sign an affidavit that you're not a US citizen or a Green Card holder when you open an account these days."
Switzerland,2rf3w4,P1r4nha,2,Mon Jan 5 22:01:38 2015 UTC,Didn't know that; thanks for explaining!
Switzerland,2rf3w4,futurespice,3,Mon Jan 5 22:05:20 2015 UTC,I actually know of people who didn't tell their banks of their double citizenship and the banks freaked out when they got wind of it. That was a couple of years ago when they started to become nervous about these things and separated their usual customers from their American ones.  These days everybody has to tell the bank if they're American or not.
Switzerland,2rf3w4,Urgullibl,1 point,Tue Jan 6 07:52:56 2015 UTC,Worse; they want to know if you were ever at any point taxable in the US. Good fun.
Switzerland,2rf3w4,royalbarnacle,1 point,Tue Jan 6 09:09:01 2015 UTC,"Huh, that I've never seen so far."
Switzerland,2rf3w4,t0t0zenerd,3,Tue Jan 6 16:49:59 2015 UTC,"Lots of questions and I cant answer most of them but here's what I know.  As an EU citizen you may come to Switzerland and look for work. You still need the permits but you can seek and start work before. Theres some limit though.  Rent in Geneva is extremely expensive. Look on comparis.ch to get an idea.   Tax is low but the extra money goes into the high rent and healthcare and living costs. You still end up better off than almost anywhere else, but don't be fooled when you look at the net salary into thinking you'll live like a king.   I find people in Geneva are very friendly towards foreigners. I've heard it's less welcoming the further you get outside of the city. But I haven't noticed."
Switzerland,2rf3w4,Urgullibl,3,Mon Jan 5 18:39:40 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking of majoring in finance or commerce so is geneva good for that or should I go to Bern or Zurich instead?   If you do commerce, HEC Lausanne is one of the top faculties in the French-speaking world (only HEC Paris is better). So that'd be perfect for you. For finance, HEC Lausanne is still very good, but from what I've heard Zurich is pretty good too. Given your stated German level, I'd take Lausanne anyway   I'm currently 17 and living in france, I hold a french and american passports so normally I can live and work in Switzerland? Correct me if i'm wrong, but doesn't the schengen agreement let me do so?   Yes, and it's unlikely to change soon, especially for students. Around a third of the students at the big French-speaking Swiss universities (UNIL, EPFL, UniGE) is French, so that's not much of a problem.   I was thinking about going to Geneva or somewhere in the french speaking part of Switzerland because my german ist nicht gut. Considering i'm fluent in french and english that may give me a leg up in the job market as well, again correct me if i'm wrong.   Being English-speaking is obviously an advantage, and I'd like to somewhat nuance the view that we're all magically bilingual: speaking English will be a prerequisite rather than an argument in a service job, but in all other cases it'll help, especially since there are different categories of ""bilingual"" and you, being a US citizen, are probably much better in English, especially in pronounciation, than most of the ""bilingual"" people in this country   I've heard university is exceptional but expensive, is it possible for foreigners to get student loans?   Yes, there are a number of ways to get your university to help you with the housing and general living. The tuition is around €800 per semester, but it is rumoured to go up soon for foreign students.   Is the rent expensive in big cities? (I'm guessing it's on par with paris)   Emphatically yes. But there are more and more opportunities for relatively cheap student housing, particularly in Lausanne. Outside that though, we are indeed talking Paris-expensive or worse, and also nearly impossible to find regardless of the price.   Should I learn german or will french and english suffice?   If you live in Lausanne/Geneva, you don't need German as a student, though it might be a good idea to learn a bit of it depending on what you want your job to be (people in HEC usually end up being managers of some sort, and since Switzerland isn't very big they'll be required to talk to German speakers)   How long does it take to obtain a swiss citizenship and will I have to do military service if I do get one?   At least 12 years living here, which'd make you 30 at the earliest by the time you get it, so no need for going to the military. Most binationals don't do it anyway.   I hear people make good money there and the the taxes are low so this makes living there all the more interesting.   Yes. Throughout your student career, you will feel like Switzerland is an absolute rip-off because of the prices, which are usually 1.5x higher than in France, but the salaries are 2.5x higher and the taxes are lower, so once you're getting money it won't be too much of a problem anymore.  A French lecturer was talking in our uni about ""people we can call relatively rich, aka earning more than €3'000 a month"" and we kinda stared at him in disbelief and told him that'd be considered a low wage for a supermarket cashier.   Are people kind or rude in general and towards foreigners?   Wherever there is a university, people will be used to foreigners and will have no negative reaction to them. You'll get some ribbing, and don't bother showing your face if France ever loses in football to Switzerland (don't worry, it'll never happen), but no further. You'll hear people say how here is better than France a lot, though - small-country complex - so get used to it.   Are there any major differences in laws between the EU-15 and switzerland?   Of course there are, but on a day-to-day level there are no more differences than if you moved to the UK or Germany.   Will I be required to own a gun or is that reserved for citizens?   No-one is required to own a gun. You'll be allowed to though, but especially in Unis people will think you're a bit weird if you're too vocal an admirer of guns.  Sidenote: why is this getting downvoted so much?  TL;DR: HEC Lausanne. Think about it."
Switzerland,2rf3w4,doodle000,1 point,Tue Jan 6 14:48:04 2015 UTC,"there are no more [legal] differences than if you moved to the UK or Germany.   Well, the UK has a Common Law system, and while the Swiss legal system does have more Common Law components than they have in France, most of it is Civil Law based on the Napoleonic code, so it is closer to France than to the UK in general."

Switzerland,2rf3w4,C4p5ul3,1 point,Tue Jan 6 00:22:50 2015 UTC,"So, here you go!  You have yet no reasons not to be able to work/study in Switzerland (except maybe heavy criminal record), you'll just have to get the proper permit.  The university is quite cheap, but as a foreigner you would have to pay about.. 30% more. In Fribourg for a semester you pay 655 as a national, and 805 as a foreigner. For the loans I'm pretty sure you would need either assets or a local that takes responsability for anything more than a few thousands.  German is often asked in most jobs, a bit less around Geneva maybe, but you can take classes to learn it just about everywhere. In Fribourg, you can get a bilingual paper which gives you a certain avantage on the market if you have a B2 or better level in German.  For commerce most universities are pretty good, and you have quite a few Hautes Ecoles de Commerces (same level as university, but more specialized) around that are quite good, too. Finance might require going to Lausanne or Geneva though.  The rent is quite expensive, especially in Geneva and to a smaller degree in Lausanne. To save some money, go for a campus place (well in advance) or try smaller cities (Fribourg or Neuchâtel).  Again, german is very sought after everywhere, but maybe less in Geneva. You should consider getting a B2 or C1 paper if you want to work here.  The swiss citizenship is quite hard to get these days, I think you have to live here for like 10 years before being eligible. But the french one should be enough for everything. The US one might give you problems with the banks though, I'd consider asking all the banks if they have a problem before that. I think Postfinance and Raiffeisen are ok with it still. You might consider abandoning it when they start asking you for taxes, anyway ;) The military service won't be a problem, worst case just leave the citizenship for after 30. They won't bother you then.  The salaries are quite good, but the living costs are quite high too. I know a few people who go shopping in France because of the high difference. Do consider buying a subscription for public transport if you are going to use it regularly.  They shouldn't be rude. Probably quite reserved (foreigners often complain about that), and we have our bad apples (our lovely Mouvement Citoyen Genevois loves to complain about french people stealing our jobs), but otherwise we are mostly polite and kind.  The differences in law... yeah they are quite a lot, but sometimes after hearing how much of a mess things are on your side you probably will like the change ;) But yeah, it is quite bureaucratic, and sometimes petty (no mowing your law on sundays!), but it works quite efficiently. I would recommand asking for more details for any important stuff (like housing, driving, and basically anything to do with the state or money).  The last question is one of the funniest I've heard about Switzerland! Nobody is required to have a gun, only people who have done military service keep their weapon at home as long as they are in their active years.   Finally, I'll do a little publicity... Do no hesitate to seriously check out Fribourg University! It is smaller and maybe less prestigious than others (n°514 in the cwur.org 2014 ranking), but it's cheaper, more humane and the quality is very good. 1st year economy classes have like 170 students (that's what I've seen, anyway), and that's more or less as big as it gets.   Anyway, hope you have a nice time in Switzerland!"
Switzerland,2rf3w4,isthesky,1 point,Thu Jan 8 23:33:50 2015 UTC,I'd not recommend Geneva too much honestly.
Switzerland,2rbi9u,SwissBliss,30,Sun Jan 4 18:40:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand neutrality. Alliances would require us taking sides. This is why Switzerland  stayed out of international organizations like the UN for a very long time. Joining a ,ilitary alliance like NATO is out of the question.  There are isolated foreign commitments as  an unarmed assistance in Kosovo. Also, the cease fire in Korea is surveilled by a Swiss officer. Interestingly, Switzerland is part of the Third World; during the Cold War Swizeland would neither join the American side (First World), nor align with the Soviet Block (Second World). Thus we became part of the nonaligned States.  This puts Switzerland in a very unique position internationally as we can host international conferences with parties of almost any conflict. These so-called good services (gute Dienste/bons offices) are the reason why critical international talks are often held in Switzerland or mediated by Swiss diplomats. https://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/aussenpolitik/menschenrechte-menschliche-sicherheit/frieden.html"
Switzerland,2rbi9u,ruggar,10,Sun Jan 4 19:07:04 2015 UTC,Based on those facts I would say it's Austria.  They are also neutral and with Switzerland the only countries in central europe that are not part of NATO.

Neutral or no the Swiss uses (and produces) weapons, ammunition and equipment from Western countries and is mostly NATO compatible (i.e. 5.56mm for rifles, 9mm for pistols).  During training they also had the classic ""red vs. blue"" so it mirrored the NATO vs. Warsaw Pack mentality.  It gets confusing with UK and (at least before the Ukraine mess) Russian troops came to train in the mountains.  South Africa was a training partner for jets during the Apartheid (eh...).

Secondly, I have studied the subject of Swiss neutrality from a legal and historical standpoint at the university of Lausanne.  OP's question was whether Switzerland had any allies. ""Ally"" is a military and strategic term. Switzerland has shied away from any alliances or foreign military commitments to the point that the subject is considered almost sacred in political circles. Even participation in the United Nations was long considered impossible because of the eventuality of Switzerland ending up in the Security council. This would in extremis lead to a decision on a conflict and thus contradict Swiss neutrality.  I fully agree with you that it is a stretchy and often opportunistic concept which is more often than not brought forward to justify Swiss isolationism. Nevertheless formal military alliances are for the time being out of the question."

Service consists of an initial 18 or 21 weeks boot-camp followed by yearly 3-4 weeks of Wiederholungskurs (=exercises for the reserves) and a yearly shooting exercise.  What I was told as a conscript is that the army serves to do the following things:   Protect Switzerland from Terrorists (I am not even kidding here) Help cleaning up, restoring power and communications after a natural disaster (eg: in Basel all the pharma production is built earthquake resistant, but power, water and internet would probably be unavailable after a major earthquake - the army would then be tasked with restoring those services)  protecting/helping in organizing some events (WEF, OSCE Minister meetings, some national sporting competitions, ensuring mobile communication during some sporting events int he alps) air policing (well, from 8:00-12:00 and 13:30-17:00 anyways - if you hijack an aircraft outside of these time-slots, the French will have to take over for us)   Nowhere was I ever told that it serves to protect gold - and protecting gold would be kinda hard anyways because most of it isn't in Switzerland."

Switzerland,2r4u5o,Chrisixx,8,Fri Jan 2 22:12:16 2015 UTC,"The problem with this question is that most Swiss don't know too much about Belgian chocolate, we can hardly get it in Switzerland anyway. I've had one Godiva bar bought from the US so far, and it was pretty good, certainly better than the dark chocolate you can get from Swiss brands. When it comes to milk chocolate, nothing beats good Swiss chocolatiers so far for me[1].   This reminds me of the time when I tried my first and last Hershey bar on an airplane. God, what an assault to the taste buds! I wouldn't even call that chocolate. How can anyone live with this?  [1] Läderach, Teuscher, Bachmann, Heini - I wish the last two from Lucerne would spread in Zurich as well, I'm not a fan of Sprüngli being everywhere."
Switzerland,2r4u5o,DeepDuh,2,Sat Jan 3 02:53:09 2015 UTC,Our lives are difficult. Hersheys is the devil disguised as a chocolate bar. Maybe if people actually understood this we could get some more imports. :(
Switzerland,2r4u5o,pascman,6,Sat Jan 3 04:59:25 2015 UTC,"I've read that one of your supermarkets even had Frey chocolate imports at one point, but for some reason it was given up. My guess is that there weren't enough Swiss flags on the package or something like that."

Bachmann and Heini are both local confisseries / chocolatiers from Lucerne that are only regionally spread apart from Lucerne: Bachmann in Sihl City Zurich and Heini in Zug. It's worth it to take a trip to Lucerne if you have a sweet tooth: Try their pralines, Birnenweggen (pie with pear filling), Lucerne style gingerbread, freshly made Berliner, chocolate bread and maybe almond croissants while you're at it. And weep when you come back to Zurich ;-)."

They have multiple locations, the main ones at Hertensteinstrasse (which you saw), at Schwanenplatz and in the Bahnhof shopping. I recommend the one in the Bahnhof actually. Also check out Heini at Falkenplatz - some of the best cakes and pralines can be found there, plus it's also a cozy and not too expensive cafe. If you like something a bit punchy, they have the original Zug style cherry cake (with alcohol) there because they bought the originating confisserie Treichler in Zug."

Switzerland,2r4u5o,skagen,2,Sat Jan 3 10:35:17 2015 UTC,Full disclosure: milk chocolate is the benchmark for me. The best milk chocolate is actually neither Belgian nor Swiss. It is Finnish. Fazer blue (Fazerin sininen) is hands down the best milk chocolate ever. It is based on a Swiss recipe that was given to Karl Fazer's son in gratitude for tending to a sick child.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Fazer
Switzerland,2r4u5o,DeepDuh,2,Fri Jan 2 23:58:38 2015 UTC,"How does it compare to Läderach? Their milk chocolate with whole nuts is the benchmark for me so far.

Switzerland,2r5u1c,Wicked_wild,16,Sat Jan 3 01:55:26 2015 UTC,"How are schools out there for children?    Good, most people go to public schools. Mandatory school (for 9 years) and kindergarten (from age of 5 I think?)   For adults?    Same. Calculate with around $1000 a semester and you'll be fine. (books, tuition) (not including rent)   School hours for kids?    Depends on their age - I think most go home over lunch, but I'm sure there are places to let them eat lunch. You're not the only one with that problem.   Is there after school curriculum?    Usually not (never?) organized by the (public) schools. ""Krippenplatz"", ""Kindertagesstätten""   Can women who are not native join military?    Not in a military role (AFAIK), but you can work in a civil function, there are all kinds of jobs, but not too many of them. Your chances in the private sector are probably much higher.   What are the phone carriers out there?    Swisscom, Orange, Sunrise   If we find work out there and lose our jobs are there shelters or transition homes to help out the family if we become homeless?    Yes. And most of our homeless are not homeless.   How much is medical insurance?    Mandatory insurance - depends on your income (you get it cheaper if you're under a certain amount (~$40k I think). Otherwise starting at around 250-350? Depends..   What is the basic Ettiquette? (Not sure if that's written right)    Not sure what you mean? Like how to act? Long story short: don't worry too much about it, you'll get the hang of it.   What is the price of internet?    Depends - $20 to $100. I pay around $60 for 100 or something mbit.   Would it be okay to bring solar panels in?    No idea, you'd have to go through customs..   Do people live off catchment there?    Not sure I understand correctly, but that's catching rainwater etc? If so, not really no.   Rent? Rent to own homes?    20% downpayment and the interest (at 5%, not market rates) (+upkeep) should not exceed 33% of your income. At these prices - look at renting first.   Children as latch key kids if both parents are working?    No problem, I think did this in forth grade?   I'm not religious will that cause problems?    Not unless you're applying at a monastery.   I do not speak german but I am trying to learn. Will that be a huge problem?    German or any other official language where you decide to settle is an absolute must unless you're working in a very highly skilled industry (IT etc). How are you gonna make friends without speaking the language? The expats from the US will move away some day..   Food prices and selection? Rice? Pasta? Veggies? FISH?? Oh please tell me theres fish!! There's fish right? Did I mention fish?    Meat is expensive (~$20 to $80 or so? Per kilogram ) (compared to mainland US, no idea about HI). Rice and pasta are cheap enough. There is fish indeed.    How about monthly bus/train passes?    Expensive, but often cheaper than owning a car (YMMV). $500 to $2400 per year - depends on how often and how far.   Do schools offer bus routes for children?    Not sure, schools are very often in walking distance. Mine was like 1km away and considered medium to somewhat longer than the others.   Would it be ok if my main transportation was skateboard or a bicycle?    Skateboard could get interesting but sure. Bicycle is fine - just remember the climate is somewhat different. I have 30cm of snow outdoors right now - less than 30 minutes from Zurich :) But public transport is excellent in Zurich.   Can I bring my Gun with me?    Yes, but you need to go through the proper customs procedure, or you'll get into trouble. Remember: No right to carry here (with exceptions - but... forget it).   How hard will it be for me to go to school?    Depends on the course - some offer a program in English.   Do people have babysitters or is it only day centers? If so how much?   Both are pretty expensive AFAIK, maybe someone else knows more. What about relatives btw?"
Switzerland,2r5u1c,hubraum,1 point,Sat Jan 3 03:47:32 2015 UTC,Thank you for your very informative reply. I do have a list of other questions which I may add to my original post. you've been really helpful
Switzerland,2r5u1c,buyacasha,12,Mon Jan 5 00:05:36 2015 UTC,"Since all your questions have been nicely answered by /u/hubraum, I'll go ahead and answer one that you didn't ask.   Is 10,000 USD enough money to start a new life in Switzerland without a job and three kids?   Absolutely not.  Seriously, I don't wan't to be negative or anything. But airfare for 5 people alone will be 4k, 2k for whatever place you're staying the first few weeks while searching for an apartment, 4k or so for the apartment security deposit,  etc. etc."
Switzerland,2r5u1c,canteloupy,6,Sat Jan 3 09:30:45 2015 UTC,Gosh 10K might be enough for the safety deposit on the flat in Zürich since these can run to three month's rent.
Switzerland,2r5u1c,the_el_jefe,1 point,Sat Jan 3 10:10:16 2015 UTC,Thank you for that insight although we were planning on finding a job before we moved out there.
Switzerland,2r5u1c,ho-tdog,2,Mon Jan 5 00:04:43 2015 UTC,I already said this to another redditer but we are not planning on moving out without a job secured first. Homesick is something I am going to have to deal with because traveling is something I am going to want to do in my life. Thank you for being the devils advocate in this thread as I do need to see both sides.
Switzerland,2r5u1c,Urgullibl,5,Sat Jan 3 13:58:14 2015 UTC,"I moved from Honolulu to Zürich five months ago, and while I can't answer all of your questions about settling here with kids (I don't have any), I can definitely try to help answer what I know.  For starters, although Switzerland has a very different climate than the islands, I think you will find that many of the great things about Hawaii, including beautiful mountains, valleys, forests, and water (fresh, in this case) can be found here as well.  If you enjoy being outside, you will love it here once you get comfortable with the cold.  Honestly, it's not the temperature that I miss in the islands, it's the sun...Zürich is really gray during the winter, but the bit of summer I experienced here was pretty nice.  You just need to take advantage of the sunny days while you can.  Also moving here in summer will help make the transition easier.  As for the language, you will definitely want to learn German as others have suggested.  It's not so much that you can't get by with just English (because you can), but if you want to live here, and not just visit, you will want to integrate into Swiss society.  I bought the Rosetta Stone courses about 6 months before I moved, and spent maybe an hour a day on it.  It's a place to start, to get you familiar with some basic things with the language, but I would recommend formal courses as well. If your spouse does not also speak German (being raised outside of Switzerland) you should do this together, and make it a point to speak to each other in your new language whenever possible.  What I can tell you is that trying to learn German while here will be extremely challenging.  The German that people speak in Switzerland is very different than in Germany (High German, or Hochdeutsch, the type you would learn in a class) and also varies by region.  As a beginner, you'll want to learn as much Hochdeutsch as possible before arriving, because you don't want to struggle with the basics of the language, and simultaneously with understanding people that are speaking a different dialect.  Since you want to work in Switzerland, you should consider your efforts (in both time and money) in learning the language to be an investment.  As for the move, it is not easy and not cheap.  If you are planning to ship anything beyond the baggage you bring on the plane, it will get expensive.  I shipped a big box (around 40"" x 40"" x 80"") with bicycles, books, a rolled up foam mattress (which would be expensive to buy here) and a lot of miscellaneous things, and that cost me close to $3000.  If you ship enough stuff to fit in a container, then the shipping becomes much cheaper by volume, but I think it's something like 8 or 10K to ship a full or partial container to Europe.  A natural first thought is to just get rid of everything and then replace it here, but because durable good are very expensive in Switzerland, this may end up costing more than shipping.  Unfortunately, there's no easy answer.  Perhaps, if you make arrangements with the Swiss military, if you will indeed be trying to work for them, they will pay for your relocation expenses.  For both jobs and apartments (don't even consider buying unless you've got boatloads of money), try to arrange as much as possible in advance.  If you are both going to try to do the Army thing, contact them now to see what you can set up.  The smaller the window between your arrival and the start of your paychecks, the better.  There are some good sites for apartment hunting (e.g. homegate.ch) but you may want to just find a sublet for the first few months, since a long-term rental will be very difficult to arrange over email.  If you will want a spacious apartment for your kids, you will want to look outside of the city center, which is generally quite expensive.  I have friends that live in Oerlikon and in Altstetten (two districts that are close to major train stations for easy connections to work) and they have been able to find large apartments for reasonable rents.  I have yet to see a ""bad"" neighborhood in the city (or country for that matter), at least by American standards, so you can generally feel comfortable looking throughout the city or wherever looks like a convenient place to live.  In terms of budget, although $10K is a good start, I don't know if that's enough.  If that is just for relocation, you can get your family of 5 here for that.  If it's just for moving, you can ship all of your stuff for that. Or if it's just for getting settled, you can definitely put down a deposit on an apartment, and cover some expenses while you get started with your jobs.  However, I don't think $10K is nearly enough to do all of these things.  Although there is very good social welfare, and you wouldn't need to worry about becoming homeless if things don't work out perfectly. There was even an initiative considered for a vote here to give everyone a basic income of 40K CHF if they weren't working (it didn't pass)...but there are many programs within the government to insure that people get support.  However, you will want to be sure that you do this right the first and (hopefully) only time you move halfway around the world.  So take extra time to prepare and save money, until you have all of your arrangements made so it goes smoothly, and you can use the extra time to work on your German.  I spent close to 3 months making arrangements in my free time, which paid off in the end.    Food is the one thing that is generally less expensive in Zürich than Hawaii, at the grocery store anyway.  Meat and fish can be expensive, but they are generally of really high quality (like, organic, grass-fed, etc. at a regular grocery store).  You will miss the fish, there's no way around it :), but there are a lot of wonderful things to eat in Switzerland that you can't find in Hawaii.  There are also Asian grocery stores around (I shop at one by the Oerlikon train station) that sell a lot of the ingredients you might miss from home, some of which are relatively cheap.  However, sometimes it's better to adapt...for example, the kimchi at this particular store comes in a small jar, doesn't look very good, and costs like 10 CHF (~$10).  You'll figure out what works for you, but don't expect to make the transition instantly.  Despite ingredients being reasonably priced, it is generally very expensive to go out to eat anywhere in Switzerland.  Unless you go to a kebab stand, you will generally pay a minimum of 20 CHF per person to go out to eat.  Restaurant food has been very good in my experience, but you have to moderate how often you go out, and readjust your sense of what you're willing to pay.  A few other random notes:   Hunting/Guns - I don't hunt, but I know that other people do, because you can buy deer sausage in the grocery store.  Switzerland has a very high rate of gun ownership, but a low rate of gun crime, unlike the US.  It certainly wouldn't be taboo to bring your firearms if you intend to hunt, but I don't know what it would take to bring them here. Transportation - Unless you live in the country, or use one for work, it is totally unnecessary to own a car here.  Public transportation is fantastic, and it is easy and reasonably priced to get anywhere in the city or clear across the country, usually faster than by car.  The trains are clean, frequent, and on-time, and you can really get anywhere by some combination or train, tram, bus, and even boat.  Bicycling is also popular and the infrastructure is very good (lots of bike lanes and paths), and you will see some people skateboarding, but it hasn't caught on here so much. Etiquette - In my experience, you shouldn't worry about this. Be polite, be yourself, and be friendly and curious with the people you meet.  Try to learn everything you can about your new surroundings by asking questions and paying attention.  It's a really exciting adventure to explore a new place, so enjoy it too!   Hope that helps!  Good luck, and please feel free to PM me with any specific questions."

Switzerland,2r5u1c,tolik83,4,Sat Jan 3 14:51:21 2015 UTC,"Everything here is very well organized but bureaucratic and expensive. If you want child care you'll typically sign up on a long waiting list and eventually get it and pay through the nose for it. But it will be very good. Same for flat hunting, it's not easy, you'll have to show dozens of pieces of justification as to your job, residency permit, etc. and pay guarantees. University entrance is ironically easier here than in the US and much cheaper because they are public but again there are strict grade and diploma requirement that will not get waived. Check their websites for info (University of Zürich although engineering is at ETHZ but it's really tough to get in and graduate, and also check out the applied sciences schools fachhochschule)."
Switzerland,2r5u1c,Urgullibl,4,Sat Jan 3 17:05:45 2015 UTC,"Lots of questions here. I agree that $10k isn't enough to start your new life in Zurich, though if your husband has family in Switzerland that are willing to assist, that would make things easier. As for joining the Army, you have to be a citizen for that, so that won't enter the picture for you until you become naturalized, which will require five years' residency (unless you've already been married for six or more years, in which case it will take less time). Obviously, you will need a  visa, though that won't be much of a problem as the wife of a Swiss citizen. If your children (if any) aren't already naturalized, you should apply for that now.  If your husband is interested in joining the Army as a professional, he should have a look at this site."

Switzerland,2r48ht,mike_haney,1 point,Fri Jan 2 18:50:41 2015 UTC,"If you're coming from Paris, going to Zurich first seems like an unnecessary detour. Why not travel via Geneva or Frasne/Neuchâtel and head East gradually?"

I second the recommendation of the Berner Oberland/Interlaken because it also is quite near Fribourg/Gruyère.   When we got married last year our Maid of Honor collected ideas for short trips for us from our guests. One that came to mind was the recommendation of tree houses near Neuchâtel that you can rent for a night or more (I think breakfast is included). We haven't done it (yet) but it sounds really cool. If you are interested I can look it up and give you the name.  The Lake of Geneva is great, I second that too.   As for trains there is the ""Glacier Express"". I haven't done it yet but it must be awesome. It connects Zermatt and St. Moritz I think. Both are expensive, kinda jet-setty touristy places. So I would suggest to spend the night a bit outside/in another village.  Unsolicited advice: Have you booked your nights in Paris yet? Also, there is the ""Fête de la Musique"" there and I think it is every year in June. I only was there once but it was just GREAT. Loved it.  Congrats to your upcoming wedding! :)"

Ein Abteilungsleiter im Basler Amt für Wirtschaft und Arbeit (AWA) scheint grosszügig Ausnahmetatbestände geschaffen zu haben: im Falle einer Untersuchung zu widerrechtlich grosszügig ausgestellten Grenzgängerarbeitserlaubnissen kamen die genauso gegen das schweizerische Aufenthaltsrecht verstossenden zahlreichen Daueraufenthaltsgenehmigungen für die Musikerinnen und Musiker aus Drittstaaten ans Licht.

The previous head of the Arbeitsamt acted in the interests of Basel, the Kulturhauptstadt der Schweiz. He recognized that Basel's music scene is dependent on the highly specialized musicians affected by this Praxisänderung, and he acted accordingly. He gave those Bewilligungen because there was no other option, besides expelling over a quarter of the professional musicians playing early music in Basel. This petition aims to protect the musicians living in Basel and to protect Basel as a European cultural capital. If Basel is important to you, please sign the petition. If not, just move along."

Definitely try to order on Swiss webstores fist, as they can be cheaper and/or faster to deliver.  I've ordered on ldlc.ch (branch of ldlc.fr) once and they asked for hefty customs fees afterwards. So you want to be careful with that, Amazon should not do it though."
Switzerland,2qyzbv,C4p5ul3,2,Thu Jan 1 11:56:07 2015 UTC,"Usually I order video games or Blu Ray. With tax free on low order rom Amazon it's impossible to find better deal in Switzerland, most new games are half price on Amazon versus Swiss webstores.  When ordering video games and Blu Ray I've never seen this line about import fees, and I order almost every months for years. But this time I've ordered a battery charger, it's maybe different. Of course for consumer electronics like computer parts/periferical, Swiss prices are better, so I rarely order such thing on Amazon."
Switzerland,2qyzbv,C4p5ul3,2,Thu Jan 1 16:37:30 2015 UTC,"Video games are definitely less expensive, that's true. I'd almost say it's a ripoff in most ""mainstream"" stores like Fnac and what not (you can also get cheaper games if you preorder in advance).  I believe electronic stuff are taxed differently, so that probably explains it."

Switzerland,2qyzbv,markus_b,2,Fri Jan 2 05:48:46 2015 UTC,"This is the trick: If the resulting VAT is below CHF 5, then it and all other fees are waived. This amounts to a grand total of CHF 62 (merchandise and shipping).  If the total amount exceeds CHF 62, then you pay customs, VAT and a handling fee, the handling fee varies, depending on the carrier, CHF 20 or more. There can be an additional postal charge as some carriers (Swiss post) will use COD for the customs fee, costing an additional CHF 15.

I just need a way to use the maps on the hike, either with an app or GPS device. That said, the planning part is more important than navigation. I'll stay on official trails where possible and I'll use paper maps as a fallback in alpine regions where I have to really depend upon the maps.  I totally forgot about the garmin maps. They are pricey, but probably very useful. Sadly, my garmin GPS (etrex Vista HCx) is not listed in the compatible devices for the current version of the maps and buying a new device would make it even more expensive. A bit more than I'm willing to spend."

Switzerland,2qp394,Urgullibl,2,Mon Dec 29 18:02:05 2014 UTC,"Always those foreign bastards with their drugs and criminality!  lol, jokes aside. Medical marijuana is available in Switzerland, but you probably won't find a doctor who prescribes it to you as there are many regulations, making it not very profitable for all involed parties. Plus, health care companies don't cover it (medical marijuana is a lot more expensive than street stuff because of said regulations), so the costs will give you more headaches than you can treat with the stuff.  Serious answer: Go visit a doctor. They are a variety of drugs for migraine and if one doesn't work or affect you negatively, the doctor will be glad to try others with you. Also, pills are not the only way of treating migraine (it should be also noted that migraine is often just a symptome for an underlying problem, from stress to nearly everything).  If you really want marijuana, just go outside and ask the next person that looks like he might have something. Or go to a cannabis shop (they don't sell if officially, but often behind the counter. At least that's what I heard.) Although it's illegal, it's very common and there isn't such a thing as a 'war on drugs' in Switzerland. There are even people walking in the crowded streets in the middle of the day smoking weed. If you get caught, there's mostly just a small fee to pay (and not even that, most of the time there's just a warning and they confiscate the stuff). IF you get caught, because the police has better things to do than looking after stoners."

Go to any pharmacy (at least in the German speaking part, I cannot confirm how it is in the Romandie and Ticino) you will find lots of homeopathy and alternative medicine.   The pharmacist will actively recommend this to you and dismiss real science in favor of pseudoscience. This is a huge problem.   But the truth is, the supply is there because the demand is there. Many Swiss are convinced that alternative medicine is more ""natural"", ""spiritual"", and overall less aggressive to your system. They read about the morally questionable dealings of CEOs in the newspaper and therefore logically want to avoid big pharma. And some rationalize ""Oh well, if it performs as good as a placebo, then its good enough"".   I'm not saying this choice is stupid, because we are all rational beings and make the decisions that we think are best for us. But it is misguided and potentially dangerous. Homeopathy has not been proven to perform better as placebo. But even if we are all rational beings, we like to dismiss the evidence because of our beliefs. I just like to think the average Swiss are better than that, but they are not.   I wish the Swiss would really inform themselves about alternative medicine and recognize it for what it is: pseudoscience, and ultimately a scam."
Switzerland,2q55vg,Urgullibl,5,Tue Dec 23 09:44:00 2014 UTC,Homeopathy and other forms of alternative medicine are mostly pushed by the mainstream left and the more extreme subsections of the right. It's a strange unholy alliance.
Switzerland,2q55vg,tango-01,1 point,Tue Dec 23 11:06:44 2014 UTC,"Probably because there usually is no political ideology behind pseudoscience. Just a thought. But yes, it really is an unholy alliance."
Switzerland,2q55vg,P1r4nha,6,Wed Dec 24 02:41:56 2014 UTC,"I disagree. There's a pattern there: is distrust of the official story. Big government and big corporations are usually made the scapegoat by them.  Often they believe in conspiracies too.   They don't trust science, even when it's several hundred years old, because applying the scientific method in the field of medicine is expensive and ""standards are dictated by big pharma"". Also scientists are funded by the government.   This is classic behavior of right wing libertarians or left wing hippies/anarchists."
Switzerland,2q55vg,Urgullibl,1 point,Wed Dec 24 07:03:11 2014 UTC,"I haven't noticed libertarians (Radicals, Liberals, parts of UDC) supporting alternative medicine. Its right-wing supporters are mostly to be found within UDF, DS and neo-Nazi groups."

Switzerland,2q55vg,tango-01,21,Wed Dec 24 02:21:47 2014 UTC,"I care a lot. When I go to a pharmacy I want medicine and not sugar pills.   You are right about one thing though, everybody should have the right to chose. The problem is, we can't chose.   Alternative medicine (homeopathy, antroposophy, acupuncture and other scams) are covered by the basic, obligatory medical insurance, and this was approved after a popular initiative on the subject was accepted. This means, I have to indirectly pay for somebody else's sugar pills, with my monthly insurance fee. And it's not only sugar pills for headaches, its for complex ""treatments"" as well.   How is this fair?"
Switzerland,2q55vg,skleronom,5,Tue Dec 23 11:09:25 2014 UTC,"Yeah I'm not going to the pharmacy often so I don't know what they recommend. If they are indeed recommending sugar pills, instead of just handing them out when asked, I'd say that's a grave mistake. Are you sure it was a ""Apotheke"" and not a ""Drogerie""? Because in a ""Apotheke"" there they are usually very well educated. I do agree, that those things should not be covered by the standard medical insurance. The problem is that they are usually a lot more expensive than some Tic Tac at Coop."
Switzerland,2q55vg,tango-01,11,Tue Dec 23 11:20:09 2014 UTC,"Are you sure it was a ""Apotheke"" and not a ""Drogerie""?   In both cases. And it makes me sick to my stomach that my insurance premium is as high as it is (and still having to pay for lots of stuff out of my own pocket) and at the same time subsidizing pseudoscience.   If there is one thing that really bothers me about Switzerland then it has to be this, the health insurance system, and people being ignorant and embracing alternative medicine."
Switzerland,2q55vg,P1r4nha,8,Tue Dec 23 11:32:07 2014 UTC,"I'd be all for organizations that might even get public funds to help people understand their misguided trust in alternative medicine.  There are these organizations for alcoholism, obesity and smoking, but not for alternative medicine.  These people don't know or don't want to believe that these pills won't have the positive effect they promise and will recommend them to their peers and family. When was the last time your mum asked you to take a smoke or was sure if you just drink enough beer your headaches every morning will disappear? It's not exactly the same thing."
Switzerland,2q55vg,Urgullibl,3,Tue Dec 23 12:39:11 2014 UTC,"Is it fair to pay church tax for religions you don't belong to?  There is an argument to be made about the limits of ""solidarity"", but this isn't it. We aren't talking about paying for the medical expenses of smokers and obese people, we're talking about forcing people to pay for therapies known to not work."
Switzerland,2q55vg,tango-01,3,Tue Dec 23 12:21:19 2014 UTC,"you make an excellent point. I really don't know if there is an answer that will satisfy everyone. To answer your question, no I don't think we should, but I also don't expect everyone to agree with me."
Switzerland,2q55vg,tango-01,1 point,Tue Dec 23 12:47:05 2014 UTC,"Is it fair to have to pay for other people?   That's the whole idea of collective insurance. We pool resources together to protect the most vulnerable. I get your point, but we are discussing something else."
Switzerland,2q55vg,tango-01,1 point,Wed Dec 24 02:46:26 2014 UTC,"No it isn't unreasonable. I don't have to agree with the decision of a mayority. As I said earlier, these are two different issues. Would you like your car insurance covering drunk driving? Same thing."
Switzerland,2q55vg,Urgullibl,4,Tue Dec 23 13:21:24 2014 UTC,It's reasonable to request that mandatory insurance only covers therapies known to be effective.
Switzerland,2q55vg,batiste,3,Tue Dec 23 16:26:52 2014 UTC,"A theory of mine, which is a bit of a rationalisation: those scams are usually cheaper than the real medicine... Some can get really expensive (I remember 500CHF for a box of acne pills). Those people might well reduce your monthly insurance fee by taking cheap sugar pills?"
Switzerland,2q55vg,tango-01,0,Tue Dec 23 17:03:03 2014 UTC,I think this is a whole different discussion. I'm saying what it is that bothers me about the Swiss: the widespread belief in alternative medicine. The prices being pushed on us by the pharma corporations is another thing entirely.
Switzerland,2q55vg,batiste,1 point,Tue Dec 23 17:39:43 2014 UTC,My theory is: people taking alternative medicin might well reduce the cost of healthcare for you.
Switzerland,2q55vg,tango-01,0,Tue Dec 23 18:59:10 2014 UTC,"No, its the insurance companies that drive up the costs. IMHO! But that is a different discussion."
Switzerland,2q55vg,batiste,2,Wed Dec 24 03:11:19 2014 UTC,Again you ignore my argument. You implied alternative medicine drive the cost up of health care. I am not convinced without facts. If it was not reimbursed the patient will favor real medication that cost probably more that homeopathic sugar pills.
Switzerland,2q55vg,aega100,2,Tue Dec 23 22:07:50 2014 UTC,The really outrages thing is: THESE FUCKING SUGAR PILLS COSTS SOOO MUCH!!!  Like a lady in front of me bought a little supply for around a month (i got interested in her conversation with the saleswoman when i saw that it was homeopathie) and she paid 150 bucks. ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SWISS FRANK FOR 30 LITTLE CAPSULES WITH WATER AND SUGAR!!!!!!!!
Switzerland,2q55vg,Urgullibl,4,Wed Dec 24 06:55:37 2014 UTC,I care because it's intellectual pollution. Even more so if idiots in politics try adding it to mandatory health insurance. I don't want to be forced to pay for homeopathy any more than I want to be forced to pay church taxes for a religion I don't belong to.

Switzerland,2q55vg,Penelope742,5,Wed Dec 24 02:44:56 2014 UTC,"I'm a Swiss national, but grew up in and live in the US. Are the Swiss very religious?"
Switzerland,2q55vg,P1r4nha,18,Tue Dec 23 10:55:05 2014 UTC,"According to this we're about 50% percent religious.  I find it's rather a rarely discussed topic here in Switzerland. I don't know of many of my friends if they are religious and how much. It's not a topic that comes up very often. Many people replace their religiousness with esoteric believes though. If it's just ""an energy in the universe"" or actual crystals, special water or certain pressure points that solve everything. It does happen on occasion though that young adults ask me about my religion on the street and invite me to their Bible talks. They've always been very nice, even when I wasn't.  In the national discussion religion is not often discussed. I think a politician better not discuss his religiousness in public. It's seen as a totally personal matter. I think that's good to a certain extent, yet to me as an atheist it makes it difficult to discuss these things because they are handled so personally. On the other hand public decisions are rarely made from a religious standpoint and in political arguments religion doesn't come up. Those are good things. People understand that their religion should not dictate legislation. EDIT: Example: An initiative to limit insurance for abortions was shot down.  Yet esoteric believes have changed what is covered by general health insurance. That for some reason homeopathy (just to name one of many examples) is seen as more valuable than for instance a dental plan is beyond me.  Last point: This all changes a bit when discussing Islam. I find it a bit hypocritical to discuss Islam as a problem when so many people are strong believers in Christianity. This discussion is rarely had and I don't know of any famous Swiss atheist who would participate in such a discussion to give it better perspective. On this sub we recently had this horrible ""interview"" between Schawinski and Thiel posted where they discussed Islam and a couple of anti-Islam/Muslim statements of Thiel. Schawinski is a self-identifying Jew and Thiel a Christian/Buddhist/etc. and even though they mention the hypocrisy that the Bible has similar vile thoughts in its ideology, they seemed to miss the point.  TL;DR: Religion is still popular, but a lot more privately discussed than in the US."

Switzerland,2q55vg,markus_b,4,Tue Dec 23 07:56:31 2014 UTC,"The general population is not very religious. Churches are mostly quite empty on normal days. Some social rituals involve church, like marriage and burial. There are non church alternatives for those, which are used. For example I'am married without church involvement. Religion is dying out in the general population, more so in the agglomerations than in the countryside.  There are christian communities similar to american churches. They are still thriving and offer an intense religious experience. Most of them have roots in the past. The Amish in the US are the offspring of such a Swiss community. While they still exist, they are not very widespread, I'd guess less than 5% of the population are affiliated."
Switzerland,2q55vg,CatnipFarmer,1 point,Tue Dec 23 07:49:53 2014 UTC,"Switzerland is far less religious than the U.S. It might be a ""religious"" country compared to places like France or the Czech Republic but by American standards it's nothing.

Switzerland,2q55vg,RagingOrangutan,3,Tue Dec 23 08:49:26 2014 UTC,"What does ""conservative"" mean in Switzerland?"
Switzerland,2q55vg,unicornarealive,5,Wed Dec 24 01:14:32 2014 UTC,"I'd say stereotypical conservative people in Switzerland are to some extend xenophobic. Not openly racist as you might see in the US for example, but there's some sort of fear of foreigners. This applies especially to foreigners from former Yugoslavia, Turkey, Northern Africa and muslims in general. They believe that their ""problems"" can be blamed on other people. If you haven't heard of the  minaret referendum you should absolutely read about it. In my opinion it's a perfect example of Swiss conservatism. Let's be honest, Switzerland has a very stable economy,  low unemployment rate, high wages, a high standard of living, free and great education and a very functional welfare & healthcare system. However you'll find conservatives in every social class. Conservatism is not an issue (if you want to call it that) because of  a lack of exposure to foreigners, liberal/social ideologies or poverty but it's based on rather pessimistic views and an irrational fear of a decline in security. Conservatives want to maintain the remains of a so called safe and sound world which has been transformed due to WW2, globalization and transnationalism. As a result foreigners and/or other potential threats to Swiss stability (such as the EU) are viewed rather negatively.   Edit: English is not my first language."

Switzerland,2q55vg,P1r4nha,4,Tue Dec 23 12:57:06 2014 UTC,"Religion and politics rarely mix here so I'd argue that no, it's not associated with the right wing. The only party that has a religion in its name is rather in the middle and is known for family values, but not necessarily conservatism.   Family values here is not a euphemism for hating gays or abortion, but actually supporting policies that help traditional forms of families. So they can be passively anti-gay or anti-feminism."

That's not what I implied to describe as conservatism in Switzerland. Sticking to what has worked in the past is absolutely fine. Not adapting to economical, political, environmental and socio-cultural changes is an issue though. This is what some conservative policies lack. Of course you can expand certain deficits to every political party in Switzerland that's a whole different discussion though."
Switzerland,2q55vg,skleronom,4,Wed Dec 24 00:52:12 2014 UTC,I do not think it's only the conservatives that are against being part of the EU.

Switzerland,2q55vg,drtsch,7,Sun Dec 28 21:22:59 2014 UTC,"Thank you, cantonese speaking stranger to teach me better, I always thought that it was Japanese..  The films title is called ""Muggeschiss"", which litterally translates into ""a flies crap"", describing something buggering, but at the same time of absolutely none importance. One can make a drama out of a ""Muggeschiss"", or one could get a whole days workload because of a ""Muggeschiss"".  IMO, the film is about a rather ambivalent trait the swiss have, the desire to be as perfect as possible; always seeking the optimum way to handle things. See our political system, which at it's core are 7 people seeking optimal consensus, or simple things like household helpers like the Sparschäler or Betty Bossy's Ham-Croissant-Portioniser-and-Cutter. Typefonts are also a good example where most perfectionism is required, and where one swiss guy was brilliant. Helvetica (the worlds most seen font probably) or Frutiger are good examples of how most attention to details can lead to a ""perfect"" product for a specific purpose, Helvetica for maximum versatility, Frutiger for maximum readability. Things like that (..or our trains, our watches, our fancy banknotes) make me proud and feel that we swiss are of some importance to the world, although we're so small. We are able to make perfect things.  BUT: Perfectionism leads to pedantism.  In order to maintain our self-image and outher-image of beeing (almost) flawless, we try to point out every ""Muggeschiss"" we find, in order to distract from what we don't want to concur with in general, but seemingly refer to a little nuisance, which by beeing corrected, will create a little loophole where we can hide in. There is always a sidestream that flows into the same direction as the mainstream, but it is easier to get out of.

I'm pretty sure that there are still many countries where being homosexual is illegal - here homosexuals are very accepted and I'm sure gay marriage would be voted yes if there is a vote on it. You can say that we have a ""langi leitig"" but you can't call us conservative. Banning minarets - I give you that. But this is certainly not enough to call switzerland ""conservative""."

Let's assume (for the sake of argument and because we don't have numbers) that all woman who are wearing burqas right now are forced to do so by their husband/community.  Now, if the ban come true those woman (or in this case their oppressors) have 2 options to comply:   Let those woman wear less conservative cloths Keep them at home as much as possible   I fear especially for those of the second option, because they now won't even be exposed to our culture anymore and have an even slimmer chance to realize that maybe their life is bad enough and they want to change. How is that helping?  If you really fear for those women who are forced to wear burqas then why don't we create a task force which is evaluating the life situation of those woman? 100 people is certainly doable and will most likely be cheaper than the whole voting campaign  But since this was never proposed I really have a hard time believing that this is to help those woman instead of standing up to the scary Muslims."

On the contrary, it would confine them into their house with no more contact to our culture.  But at least you can tell to yourself that you've done something against those scary Muslims, right?

If it really was about those women then it's be much more effective to actually evaluate the life situation of those 100 people. That would actually do some good for those who are oppressed. Instead of just forcing them to stay home when their husbands don't want them outside showing their face.
Switzerland,2q2f7y,canteloupy,4,Mon Dec 22 16:30:41 2014 UTC,I fullheartedly agree. Working on domestic violence and providing support for possibly isolated women is more effective if this is about coercion.

You seriously try to deviate the level of moderation in Switzerland by using global numbers? From 1.6 billion to 400k? Come on, that has to be the one of the biggest generalization I've ever heard.  Level of moderation varies a lot between different countries (as you'd see on the survey you rely on), the more westernized the more moderate. So those numbers don't represent Swiss Muslims in the slightest. But hey, let's pick the numbers which at first glance support your point the most, right?  And on the first two topics: I really don't want to know how many Christians in Switzerland think that they are superior to women and would agree to Christian laws.

Switzerland,2q2f7y,P1r4nha,6,Tue Dec 23 11:17:46 2014 UTC,"Exactly my idea too. If you want to help them you give them the chance to change their lives for the better, but they have to make the first step.  This should be an issue of domestic abuse (just like the proxy reason for banning the minarets: genital mutilation). Forcing them to put down the burqa seems to be too patronizing to me."

Switzerland,2q2f7y,P1r4nha,1 point,Mon Dec 22 17:12:22 2014 UTC,"Hell yes it was. The argument was generally that Islam is horrifying, genital mutilation being one of the more horrifying ones. Also it's surprisingly wide spread among moderate Muslims as there are various forms of genital mutilation: Not all get their vagina sewn shut.  Anyway, the genital mutilation arguments were made and attracted left wing feminist groups to the pro side of the minaret ban. I would be astonished if the recorded numbers of genital mutilations here in Switzerland (obviously the girls get flown out to other countries) would've even gone down a bit."
Switzerland,2q2f7y,Wh1sperw1nd,9,Mon Dec 22 17:55:11 2014 UTC,I think women who chose to wear a burka are aware that they are alienating themselves from a major part of the local society. I guess it is their personal right to do so if they fancy that. But seeing how frowned it is upon I don't think they will improve the mentality towards muslims. At all.

While my swiss french grandparents used to travel the world and love different cultures, my swiss german ones just liked to stay in their part of switzerland.   It probably has to do with being in the minority (french speaking), which pushed us to visit other places more, whereas swiss germans are really Swiss Swiss.

Gold has been worth something throughout history and has never lost it's value. Additionally, it is used in industry processes and will for that reason alone never completely lose it's value. The swiss franc is backed by the state, economy, it's people and the federal bank doing everything it can to preserve it's value. Bitcoin is backed solely on the wishful thinking of those that invest in it. Now as cool as it is, maybe this idea will take off in the future, maybe it will not. But I surely would not compare Bitcoin to gold or any other fiat currency."
Switzerland,2q1znu,kraml,0,Mon Dec 22 15:21:49 2014 UTC,"What is this based on? Proven scarcity? Just because something is scarce does not make it an accepted currency or good investment.   You are right, and I am not claiming that value follows from scarcity. It is worth what people believe it is, no question about that. In bitcoin's case, many people already do believe it is worth something. For good reasons, too, because it has all the good properties of gold, but more and better: i.e.:   its scarcity is fixed, but new gold is minted every year with no definite end in sight.  Bitcoin is unforgeable, while gold has been forged a lot of times.  You can split up and spend your bitcoin worldwide instantly at almost no cost, while moving gold is hugely expensive and inefficient.  Lastly, Bitcoin is the only money in existence which you can truely own. Paper fiat money? Can be declared invalid or made worthless by delibarate inflation by the govermnment. Money at the bank? Just numbers, no full reserve (not all people could withdraw at the same time in bank runs); can be confiscated at any time. Etc.   Many of those properties are truly novel, and highly desriable. Of course it is not as safe a bet as gold (yet), but still very promising. Which is all I said in my original post.  That the common people have power over Bitcoin and not goverments is a really cool thing too. This could potentially lift poor third world country out poverty, since they can evade corruption and get connected to the global economy cheaply and safely."

Switzerland,2pykss,memeid,4,Sun Dec 21 10:39:13 2014 UTC,"Basler in Basel here. I'd also say that Ueli Bier, Unser Bier is the right order.  Ueli was Basels only traditional Beer from an independent brewery ""Brauerei Fischerstube"", located in the center of Kleinbasel. You can take tours and their brewery there is still very small. (I think they outsourced a part of their production at some point however.) You can get it at house-owned restaurant or at Supermarket ""Manor"", also in Kleinbasel, where Tourists naturally walk by. Speak ""ooeawly beer"" when asking for it.  Unser Bier was founded somewhen in the 90es or early 2000s because some people around the Paul Ullrich Company (which brings me to the point: yes, they know about good beverages.) wanted to have an alternative tho the big coorporate owned brands. So they founded this incorporated company which would pay its shareholders in beer. The Idea was that many Baslers should buy shares and support this local brand ""Unser Bier"" or English ""Our Beer"". The Idea obviously worked and was great for marketing, I think that they have outgrown ""Ueli Bier"" today, but not shure."
Switzerland,2pykss,dafoak,4,Sun Dec 21 11:41:17 2014 UTC,I used to prefer Ueli but the summer before last it seemed that all of their bottled beer was too gassy. I switched to Unser just to stop spraying beer all over myself at the Rhein. But I've noticed that doesn't happen anymore. Also Ueli has really good seasonal beers and a good IPA. How do they spell it? Aypeay?
Switzerland,2pykss,renner2,2,Sun Dec 21 11:44:46 2014 UTC,"The Aypiey (phonetic for IPA) is by Unser  Bier, actually, and happens to be the first Swiss traditional brewery's beer I've actually liked. Well worth a try. In general, most beer here is light and lagerish, you'll have to have a particular fondness of the style to appreciate the various Appenzellers and Feldschlöschens. The micros mentioned by some have been a bit bolder, if not always earth shaking, and are probably best concentrated at the Beers of the World shops."

Switzerland,2pswo7,peter778,12,Fri Dec 19 17:13:34 2014 UTC,"In short: yes. Through initiatives it is possible to change ANY part of the constitution including recognised national languages, national anthem, basic human rights and also the political system.  Edit: Here you find the Swiss Federal Constitution, every point is changeable by the people and only by the people. http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/1/101.en.pdf   Edit 2: Thanks /r/KingDDD for the addition:   the constituent (so the supreme politic power) in Switzerland is the people AND the cantons. If only 100'000 people can bring up an initiative to the vote, there must be a double majority (people + cantons) in favor of the initiative for it to be accepted."
Switzerland,2pswo7,Wh1sperw1nd,7,Fri Dec 19 17:42:22 2014 UTC,"Except for stuff that goes against ius cogens, art. 139 iirc.   For example, to bring back torture, you would first have to change art. 139 and then opt out of any international treaties we signed that include dispositions on torture."
Switzerland,2pswo7,NiggaWeMadeItOhShit,3,Fri Dec 19 18:29:47 2014 UTC,"Well yes, obviously you are right, having contradicting laws makes no sense and the law recquires further changes which would need being ratified by the people."
Switzerland,2pswo7,Wh1sperw1nd,4,Fri Dec 19 22:39:50 2014 UTC,"Actually it's not totally accurate : the constituent (so the supreme politic power) in Switzerland is the people AND the cantons.  If only 100'000 people can bring up an initiative to the vote, there must be a double majority (people + cantons) in favor of the initiative for it to be accepted. You're right otherwise."
Switzerland,2pswo7,KingDDD,0,Fri Dec 19 18:32:34 2014 UTC,"With double majority do you mean that 2/3 of the voters and 2/3 of the cantons must support the initiative on referendum? Also, what is the minimum number of people that have to participate on the referendum?"
Switzerland,2pswo7,P1r4nha,2,Fri Dec 19 19:45:15 2014 UTC,"No, it is 1/2+1 of the votes and 12 cantons, those are the two majorities."
Switzerland,2pswo7,Gimly,1 point,Fri Dec 19 20:56:35 2014 UTC,"There's the majority of the whole population and then there's the majority of the cantons. A ""canton's vote"" depends on the majority of its population. That way population rich cantons can't overrule smaller ones."
Switzerland,2pswo7,TheLandOfAuz,1 point,Fri Dec 19 21:32:42 2014 UTC,"There's no minimum number of people that have to participate on the referendum. It's usually around 30% only unfortunately. People are not very invested in politics, probably because we vote so often that they are bored."
Switzerland,2pswo7,Wh1sperw1nd,1 point,Fri Dec 19 21:53:53 2014 UTC,"So, in theory, ihr habt the power to take away euren power by, say, making a change to the constitution that disallows citizens to change part of the constitution? That's mind trippy."
Switzerland,2pswo7,TheLandOfAuz,3,Fri Dec 19 22:29:03 2014 UTC,"Yes, this is actually part of an ongoing discussion. Some think that basic human rights must not be changeable by the people and want to implement new rules. These new rules however still would need to be ratified by the people.  P.S. Thanks for the effort but please don't write that way.."
Switzerland,2pswo7,Wh1sperw1nd,1 point,Fri Dec 19 22:47:17 2014 UTC,That's a good argument/discussion. Where is the majority leaning? Und sorry aber manchmal hat Englisch keine gute Wörter für meine Meinung. Oder eventuell ist mein Englisch nicht so gut.

The topic is a little complicated right now, as far as I know it is unclear what the general opinion is on this matter. My personal opinion is that we should let the people stay the highest authority in Switzerland, not the law. But I also think we should let those human rights laws stay in our constitution. Not because the law forces us, but because we want to."

Switzerland,2pswo7,Urgullibl,2,Sat Dec 20 12:00:51 2014 UTC,"Popular initiative  Citizens may seek a decision on an amendment they want to make to the Constitution. For such an initiative to be organized, the signatures of 100,000 voters must be collected within 18 months.  A popular initiative may be formulated as a general proposal or – much more often – be put forward as a precise new text whose wording can no longer be changed by Parliament and the Government.  The authorities sometimes respond to such an initiative with a counter-proposal (generally less far-reaching) in the hope that the people and States will give their preference to it.  Since 1987, the possibility of a double yes vote has existed in ballots on popular initiatives: voters may approve both the initiative and the counter-proposal. A deciding question determines which of the two texts will enter into force if both of them secure a popular majority and a majority of the States.  Popular initiatives do not originate from the Parliament or Government but from the citizens themselves. They are therefore regarded as the driving force behind direct democracy."
Switzerland,2pswo7,C4p5ul3,2,Fri Dec 19 18:26:55 2014 UTC,"There is pretty much no limit, other than the fact that the initiative must treat only one matter."
Switzerland,2pswo7,Urgullibl,2,Sat Dec 20 01:29:15 2014 UTC,So like Ecopop then. :D
Switzerland,2pswo7,Xorondras,3,Sat Dec 20 02:32:52 2014 UTC,"The decision on that is parliament's, and parliament tends to be very lenient on that."

Switzerland,2pswo7,hopsafoobar,1 point,Sat Dec 20 15:42:49 2014 UTC,Not only this. We could start an initiative for total revision of the constitution. If successful this would result in immediate re-election of parliament and executive. The new government will then have to work out a new constitution which must then be accepted by voting.

Whenever I thought Schawinski was making a good point he added some irrelevant low blow to provoke. Thiel wasn't making good points at all.  EDIT: The few points Thiel made were kind of half-assed and it really took him a while to come up with them. The more I think about the more I'm convinced he's just playing for time with most of the questions Schawinski throws at him."
Switzerland,2pl5j5,P1r4nha,8,Wed Dec 17 17:39:45 2014 UTC,Really? I liked Thiels statements about Schawinski being a boulevard Journalist.  And also his point about the coran being more of a state ideology instead of a religion which is at least true if we take a look at the origins of islam.
Switzerland,2pl5j5,fraighthomas,4,Wed Dec 17 21:40:49 2014 UTC,"You're right, those were the only two points with some substance. It took him forever to come up with them, though.. Almost too late.   I also liked him to get Schawinski to go from ""mostly read the Quran"" to ""not having read the Quran"".   I actually think they could have met in the middle, because they weren't that far apart, but they both wanted to assassinate each other's characters so much, it took them half an hour of grandstanding to realize that."
Switzerland,2pl5j5,P1r4nha,3,Wed Dec 17 22:24:55 2014 UTC,But he read Mein Kampf!  Know that moment when someone asks you whether or not you've seen some movie or read some book you didn't but you tell them you did anyway? That might've been that moment.
Switzerland,2pl5j5,Skinnj,2,Thu Dec 18 05:57:14 2014 UTC,"Exactly. I get that you would say that about an unrelated book, but I find it kind of obvious that when you invite a guest about his Islamophobia (justified or not), you shouldn't lie about having read the Quran. How stupid is that.  And I read Mein Kampf as well, and it's a badly written book but still more readable than the Quran. I'm astonished people get anything understandable out of the Quran.. maybe it gets better in the middle. I had to give up."

I'm neither a big fan of Schawinski nor Thiel but Schawinski's debating skill were just a joke. He constantly tried to defend the quran and tried to justified it with 'other things are bad too' which is an argument of a five year old or so. And he kept repeating it. Also it was obvious that Schawinski was totally unprepared. Why didn't he point out the hypocrisy that Thiel only attacks Islam even though Thiel admits that he likes Christianity which is just as brutal? Also Thiel constantly quoted some professor. Schawinski could have ended this by asking Thiel whether he just repeats things other people say.

Switzerland,2pl5j5,buyacasha,5,Thu Dec 18 01:27:49 2014 UTC,"I won't even talk about Thiel as I really don't know him and, judging from just this clip, I think he's somewhat of an idiot.   That being said: What a very embarassing und unprofessional performance by Schawinski."
Switzerland,2pl5j5,3506,2,Wed Dec 17 21:28:14 2014 UTC,"Check the 20min comments, seems like Schawinsky isn't very well liked..."
Switzerland,2pl5j5,seitgeist,18,Wed Dec 17 18:47:30 2014 UTC,"Based on 20min comments, the Ecopop initiative would have won with a landslide too though."

Switzerland,2pl5j5,whitepalms85,4,Wed Dec 17 20:13:39 2014 UTC,"Honestly, the people on 20min comments literally are the worst trash our society has to offer. If they would be representative of Switzerland, we would be a third world country run by some fascist dictator or so. Btw. check out the comments, when the article is about Russia. They love Putin, nothing beats a Russian dictator, right? And one article later they complain that the federal counsel isn't 'implementing the people's decisions' and 'not respecting democracy'. Try that in Russia... Those people are actually the main reason why I'm against Volksinitiativen. Who had the absurd idea to let those people vote?!   ah and btw. I'm actually not on the side of Schawinsky on this."
Switzerland,2pl5j5,tetroxid,1 point,Thu Dec 18 20:15:01 2014 UTC,"They are a very vocal minority. Most sane people are intelligent enough to recognise when they aren't knowledgeable enough about a subject to comment, however the 20min faction does not posess that ability for self assessment, hence the idiotic comments.  Tl;dr don't lose faith in our democracy (possibly the only democracy in the world, by the way, we ought to hold on to it) because of a few vocal idiots."

Switzerland,2pkpzu,Lockeylom,11,Wed Dec 17 13:43:20 2014 UTC,"I heard about this ""pay back"" stuff for the first time. You got some links to read regarding this?"
Switzerland,2pkpzu,walkeezy,10,Wed Dec 17 14:36:08 2014 UTC,It depends in which Kanton you live. I thought in Geneva you don't have to pay something back. But in Zurich you would have to pay it back if you get unexcpected alot of money (ex. lottery or heritage).  Every Kanton can hadle it on their way.  I didn't find a link where you can see what you have to do in every canton but this one shows it for Zurich
Switzerland,2pkpzu,P1r4nha,5,Wed Dec 17 14:56:15 2014 UTC,"wenn Verwandte in direkter Linie (Eltern, Kinder, Grosseltern, Enkel) aufgrund ihres hohen Einkommens oder Vermögens unterstützungspflichtig sind   This is very surprising. Does this mean that if I have a son that starts receiving welfare and I earn a lot of money, I would have to pay for his welfare!"
Switzerland,2pkpzu,086,1 point,Wed Dec 17 15:36:37 2014 UTC,"Yeah, looks like the government forces you to take care of your relatives when you can afford it."
Switzerland,2pkpzu,anonlymouse,3,Thu Dec 18 14:34:07 2014 UTC,"Sorry for being picky. Your link does not go to the canton of Zurich, but the city of Zurich.   Could it be that it's not just something dealt with on a canton basis, but also differently between communities?"
Switzerland,2pkpzu,YeaISeddit,1 point,Wed Dec 17 17:56:12 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it used to be your Heimatort had to pay for you, and if you lived elsewhere, your Heimatort would get billed by the commune you're in."
Switzerland,2pkpzu,netheranthem,4,Thu Dec 18 04:02:14 2014 UTC,"A pretty biased article, but it says some of the stuff I mentioned:  http://www.vimentis.ch/d/dialog/readarticle/sozialhilfe---krasses-nichtwissen/  Social help is more like a credit, where you get the money but that you will have to pay back once your financial situation has improved."
Switzerland,2pkpzu,anonlymouse,4,Wed Dec 17 14:45:07 2014 UTC,"In my opinion this can be productive and contra-produktive.  Sure you could think that you never go to work again and live from that money, but that money is not much.  In my opinion it makes more sense if you get a new job as soon as possible and then only pay a few thousend back instead and after that you have lot's more money every month, than with the welfare."
Switzerland,2pkpzu,Redxl1,1 point,Wed Dec 17 14:40:41 2014 UTC,"Sorry to be that guy, but it is ""counter-productive."" I wonder if you have to pay back interest. I suppose not. Also can you lose these debts through bankruptcy? Sounds like student loans in the USA. After a year of social security you'd basically be locked out of home ownership for a long while."
Switzerland,2pkpzu,Urgullibl,3,Wed Dec 17 16:03:31 2014 UTC,"Completely different situation. In Switzerland home ownership isn't based on air, and it's not commonly seen as a human right like in the US.   What you need is 20% of the cost upfront and enough income to sustain your mortgage payments. Hence, any debts you are reimbursing are deducted from your income for this calculation."
Switzerland,2pkpzu,anonlymouse,1 point,Wed Dec 17 18:54:09 2014 UTC,"Sure you could think that you never go to work again and live from that money, but that money is not much.   You could save up to buy a Rolex in a few months on the money you get. You could live quite comfortably on the money they give you."
Switzerland,2pkpzu,Urgullibl,2,Thu Dec 18 04:03:00 2014 UTC,"The social system understands the position of contra-productive, they are more concerned with seeing people off the system than paying them back. If your job only pays slightly more than what the social program offers, they will not bother you for very long to get payback. Of course if you get a really nice job with an annual of 6 figures +, expect to pay much of it back. Been dealing with a chronic disease for the past few years and am still on the system, this is my understanding at least from my talks with my counselor."
Switzerland,2pkpzu,anonlymouse,1 point,Thu Dec 18 08:51:11 2014 UTC,"Why shouldn't you be required to pay back when you get in a position where you can? The system works under the assumption that people are honest (I know, revolutionary), and strangely enough, it seems to work most of the time."
Switzerland,2pkpzu,Urgullibl,2,Wed Dec 17 21:44:53 2014 UTC,Because when you make money you're going to be paying taxes to cover someone else's social support.
Switzerland,2pkpzu,anonlymouse,2,Thu Dec 18 04:04:41 2014 UTC,"Everybody pays taxes, regardless of whether or not they ever got aid."
Switzerland,2pkpzu,Urgullibl,1 point,Thu Dec 18 04:36:38 2014 UTC,Because they might at some point need it. It's the same as paying medical insurance even if you never get sick.
Switzerland,2pkpzu,anonlymouse,1 point,Thu Dec 18 04:40:42 2014 UTC,"Not really. Pretty much everybody gets sick at some point, but only a small minority will ever need social aid."

Don't know where you guys are located, but if you wanna do something with an adrenalin kick come to basel. We have a underground canal through almost the whole city called Birsig canal.  It's fucking huge dark and the only thing you can hear is the water rushing by under your feet. Bring good flashlights with you if you decide to go down there. About halfway through there is a decently sized room with stone chairs, if you bring a boombox or something similiar you can have your own private rave down there."
Switzerland,2pm6he,elninofamoso,1 point,Wed Dec 17 22:23:02 2014 UTC,Thank you for the awesome idea. It sounds really interesting. Is it forbidden to enter the canal without permission? And how long does it take to walk through?
Switzerland,2pm6he,elninofamoso,0,Thu Dec 18 08:03:21 2014 UTC,"It's actually forbidden to enter without a permission, but you can either get a permission rather easy or just be quite while going in. I've done it many times without anyone noticing. If you should get caught, don't worry the'll just show you out and have a short talk with you. To walk completely through you'll have about 30 minutes if you just walk through, but since you'll be the first time there it will probably take at least an hour to get through. Before you go, check the weather. If there is any strong rain I wouldn't suggest to go since you can't und walk all the was through and the easy entrance could be blocked. I may still have some pictures somewhere, if I find them ill post here."

Switzerland,2p6gpa,leo_037,1 point,Sun Dec 14 18:40:36 2014 UTC,"an electric heater is almost the most efficient possible use of electric power: 1 W_el in yields 1 W_th out.  with a heat pump (let's take COP=4.5), 1 W_el in yields 4.5 W_th out.  with a domestic solar thermal heating system, 2 W_el in allows for the circulation of fluid with a gain in the order of 5 kW_th (peak). not sure about average, but probably in kW_th.  you seem to understand that 1 W_el onsite may actually cost 2.5 W_th at a thermal power plant, obtained from 3 W_fuel. if you bypass the transformations of thermal-to-electric-to-thermal by burning fuel in situ, 3 W_fuel may yield 2.5 W_th, instead of the initial 1 W_th."

Those countries fended off far more capable invaders, but at greater cost in lives and treasure than if they had simply surrendered! If you're not going to get a real deterrent (nuclear) anything else simply allows you to make very destructive choices.  If any of the great powers actually makes the decision to invade Switzerland, any conventional Swiss military only exists to be crushed. And just like the last time Switzerland was at risk, that decision will not be based on Swiss military capability but on Swiss willingness to make concessions to the potential invader."

Switzerland,2p60ld,razuliserm,2,Sun Dec 14 19:13:55 2014 UTC,They didn't use it as a source to anything. Because you are saying this I'm assuming you don't speak German. Here's what they're saying:   Im Internet kursieren verschiedene Gerüchte über die Krawallmacher.    Various rumors are spreading through the internet.
Switzerland,2p60ld,tuar3k,1 point,Sun Dec 14 19:39:13 2014 UTC,"I do speak German! The fact that they wrote that however does not really change my standpoint for several reasons:  1) (And most importantly) Rumours are imo not newsworthy! The media is supposed to tell us facts not rumours! I am sure, that even if they state that it's just a rumour, they still form public opinion and I think a large percentage of people who read that are now 100% sure that these people all are FCZ-Hooligans. For that reason they risk starting a witchhunt without having any significant proof. Now also Blick.ch seems to have indirectly quoted the comment above Link At least Blick.ch seem to have found an additional source. Of course a witchhunt against Hooligans, which is a very obscure group and which has a very bad reputation anyway, is not that bad (It is also very easy since noone wants to defend hooligans. This is probably also the reason 20min published this report without any sort of factchecking). In other cases however this kind of ""journalism"" can lead to severe damaging of someones reputation.   2) The author of this article has no way check if the source ot this rumour is in anyway trustworthy (no offense to whitepalms85 ;-)). It could possibly be that someone who has an interest in spreading this rumour wrote the comment above, trying to bash the accused group. (Which again is probably not true here, but could well happen in another case). Plus, if they absolutely have to report on rumours, I think it should come from someone who is an expertof the scene, or at least from someone who was personally present that night. I think it is a very slippery slope if news-outlets start quoting people who cannot be held accountable for their words in any way. Because then people can just say whatever they want about whoever they want in the media without having to bring up any kind of proof for their statement.   3) 20min has no (at least no personal) way to check whether they actually quote the person correctly. As we now saw in the responses of whitepalms85 above, they did not quote him correctly. They did not contact him to check if they can use his words in the newsarticle or if they understood him correctly.  Sorry for the long rant, but these are the reasons i still stand behind my statement, that  I think that this is terrible journalism. And again i don't want to defend anybody here and I actually don't care if these people were FCZ-Hooligans or not. I just think 20min should keep to reporting on facts!"

Switzerland,2p60ld,Urgullibl,0,Mon Dec 15 16:13:13 2014 UTC,"Let me get one thing clear: If any of those people are identified, the owner of whatever they destroyed is free to go after them in civil court and financially ruin them as much as they want. Damages for destroyed property are not a criminal matter and can be sued for by anyone. The problem is that the police are not doing their job and letting most of them get away without being properly identified.   You are basically arguing that people should be able to destroy other people's property and not be paying for the damage. That provides a positive incentive to cause further destruction.  Harsh justice would be slapping on fines and prison time in addition to civil restitution. Enforcing civil restitution and holding people responsible for damage they deliberately chose to cause is not harsh, it's the most basic common sense. If their vandalism financially ruins them, that will provide a better disincentive to others than any positive reinforcement ever could."

Sure, it sucks if they have to pay 10k but that's what you get when you destroy things.   10k would be possible, but 1mio, as OP did suggest (which could easily come together with just a few luxury cars), is a whole different topic."

Seriously, are you one of the assholes that was part of this?! And those people aren't the same as the alcoholic punks from the parks. A lot of these people have jobs, wouldn't be surprised if a lot of them have rich parents...   Let's face it, that damage will be payed by the insurance.   Honestly, what the fuck is wrong with you!!?! How is it relevant that an insurance pays? It's still damage and just because a lot of people end up paying for it through an insurance scheme is certainly not a justification! Do you even know what an insurance is? Also not all of these businesses have an insurance and insurance often don't cover such things.  It's bizarre that you think people shouldn't pay for damages. What would you say, if I smash your room?   10k would be possible, but 1mio, as OP did suggest (which could easily come together with just a few luxury cars), is a whole different topic.    Well, there were 200 people so that would split the bill and why wouldn't you have to pay for a car, just because it was an expensive one? That makes it even worse!

Switzerland,2p60ld,whitepalms85,2,Sun Dec 14 20:31:16 2014 UTC,"Only 4 people got arrested but I was a bit unclear: not the parents should pay but the rioters aren't poor people. The other guy tries to present them as victims that couldn't pay for the damages, when in fact it's much more likely that they actually have jobs and / or are students. Such riots are certainly not organized by homeless people and alcoholics. And the family father the works in a low paid job to bring this family through certainly wasn't part of it either. It's just idiots that think it's fun to smash things."
Switzerland,2p60ld,Syndic,0,Sun Dec 14 21:08:18 2014 UTC,"Seriously, are you one of the assholes that was part of this?!   What? How did you get that idea?   A lot of these people have jobs   Even someone with a decent job (60k annualy) wouldn't be able to payoff 1Mio within one or two decades.   wouldn't be surprised if a lot of them have rich parents   Which wouldn't matter in any case as long they are adults. We don't have Sippenhaft in Switzerland.   Honestly, what the fuck is wrong with you!!?! How is it relevant that an insurance pays?   Dude relax. Just because I don't hold your opinion doesn't mean you've to freak out. And it certainly doesn't mean that you may lash out against me. Keep this civil please.  You were wondering how those who had their property destroyed are helped in such a situation. And the only realistic solution is that insurance will pay the damage because even if the offender is caught, he most likely won't have the cash around to replace a BMW and we surely can't expect the victim to wait a decade till he pays it off, right?   It's bizarre that you think people shouldn't pay for damages.   I just don't find this proposition realistic. Sure it sounds good on paper, but the real world is quite different.   Well, there were 200 people so that would split the bill and why wouldn't you have to pay for a car, just because it was an expensive one?   I seriously doubt that 200 people together put the same car on fire. Our justice system doesn't work that way. You only are punished for stuff you personally did and not because you happened to be around.   That makes it even worse! So you're logic is the higher the damage the lower the punishment?   No, my logic is that we should focus on dealing with such situations in long-term solution which does benefit our society as a whole instead of using revenge fantasies which don't do any good beside making people feel better. That's why we have a rehabilitation justice system instead of a punishment based as you find in the US. And if you look over there you might get an idea why rehabilitation works  better for a society as a whole."
Switzerland,2p60ld,whitepalms85,2,Sun Dec 14 22:04:16 2014 UTC,"What? How did you get that idea?   You're defending violence.   Even someone with a decent job (60k annualy) wouldn't be able to payoff 1Mio within one or two decades.   overall damage was 1 mio, not per person, so per person the damage is much lower. And I don't feel sorry for them if it takes them a few years to pay it back.   Which wouldn't matter in any case as long they are adults.   I'm not saying the parents should pay, but they aren't poor homeless people or so.    And the only realistic solution is that insurance will pay the damage because even if the offender is caught, he most likely won't have the cash around to replace a BMW and we surely can't expect the victim to wait a decade till he pays it off, right?   That makes no sense. 1. not everyone has insurance against riots, it's rather uncommon. 2. insurance are just a pool of money, it still means that other people would have to pay for the damages the rioters caused. An insurance isn't some kind of magic company that creates money to pay for you damages or so. 3. Even if the insurance pays, they can still be held reliable, simply the insurance would have to wait longer if they can't pay (and again, why do you assume that they are poor, it's rather unlikely).   I seriously doubt that 200 people together put the same car on fire. Our justice system doesn't work that way. You only are punished for stuff you personally did and not because you happened to be around.   Well, if it was just one person, why wouldn't the person be held responsible? So can I just come to your house and destroy everything and that's okay, because I did it all on my own?   instead of using revenge fantasies   What are you talking about? They simply need to pay for the damage, I'm not even talking about sentences.    That's why we have a rehabilitation justice system instead of a punishment based as you find in the US.   That's not how our system works. If you damage something, then you have to pay for it. You clearly don't understand our system. Sorry, but some people cause massive damages for no reason and you're telling me that they are the victims?! wft!  And 'rehabilitation' would be instead of sending them to jail, sending them is some kind of training against extremism or so. That would be on top of the damage, not instead."

Exact proportions of those ingredients vary depending on who you ask. I have a recipe laying around somewhere, give me a little time.  Edit: There you go. I've made this recipe many times, it's pretty much fool-proof.   Ingredients:   250 g butter (at room temperature) 4 eggs 250 g sugar 1 pinch of salt Zest of one lemon 1-2 tablespoons of lemon juice 500 g white all-purpose flour   Preparation:   Mix the butter until it is homogenous. Add sugar, salt and eggs and continue mixing. Add lemon zest and juice. Gradually add the flour through a sieve while continuing to mix. Cover and let sit in the fridge for two hours. Form the dough into hazelnut-size balls. Heat your iron, add the dough balls (one per bricelet) and bake. You'll have a bit of a learning curve until you figure out the exact time, it's usually between 45 and 90 seconds depending on how dark you like them. Let cool and keep in an air-tight container.   Variants:    Use orange or lime zest/juice instead of lemon Add a little vanilla extract and/or a dash of kirsch, Grand Marnier or limoncello Add a little cinnamon Come up with your own variant"

Switzerland,2owo3f,iWantADelorean,16,Wed Dec 10 21:55:38 2014 UTC,"I did exactly this (also from California) last July. The best thing you can do is hire a professional shipping company who will handle the logistics and customs for you (around $3000). The key to being able to bring the car in without paying customs or taxes is to do it as ""Übersiedlungsgut,"" meaning you need to have owned the car for at least 6 months in the US, and you are shipping it to Switzerland along with all your other possessions as part of the move. You are correct that you can not sell the car for 12 months after bringing it to Switzerland (technically you can, but then you get hit with the customs and taxes).  Once the car is here it needs to go trough inspection before you can get it registered and insured. If you are talking about a newish car, the general rule is that if it has stock parts and meets EU norms it should pass inspection just fine. The two main things you'll likely run into here is that your US car might have yellow daylight running lights, which are not allowed in Switzerland. If your car has Xenon lamps you'll also need a washing system. Apparently the US is one of the only places where these things aren't mandatory, so you may very likely need to get one installed. I had to on my car (even though it was a German car), which cost somewhere around 1500 CHF.  All in all bringing my car over was a lot more work than I expected. But in the end it was still quite a bit cheaper than if I would have sold my car in the US and bought a new one here."
Switzerland,2owo3f,knpee,3,Wed Dec 10 22:38:59 2014 UTC,"This is a good answer. I just add to it that your car will be shipped by, well, a ship! They charge by volume so you can pretty much fill up the container (and inside your car!) with anything else you want to ship at no extra charge.  However, keep in mind that shipping takes time. At worst case it can take up to 3 months. It means that for 3 months you will not have a car. If you are a family, that might be something to consider: when you start here in Switzerland you might want to be quite mobile to buy many things you would need for your new residence. Your kids might need transport to school. If you want to spend time to look for apartments, having a car helps speeding up your search. Rental cars are very expensive here so you should plan ahead. Public transport is excellent though it might not be the most convenient option to move around as a family."
Switzerland,2owo3f,shapul,1 point,Thu Dec 11 10:03:40 2014 UTC,"pretty much fill up the container (and inside your car!) Unless I was lied to by the shipping company and customs this is actually not true. They told me several times not to put stuff inside of the car or it would not even get loaded onto the boat because it wouldn't pass customs in Europe.    But your point about the boat reminds me... OP should make sure that the car is shipped below deck. If it is not you are almost guaranteed to get rust because of the saltwater. Shipping it below deck is slightly more expensive, but still way cheaper than the rust damage in the long run."
Switzerland,2owo3f,spededa,1 point,Fri Dec 12 08:48:07 2014 UTC,"Thank you for your answer! Could you give me the name of the shipping company you used?  Since my car is slowly dying, the one I would import would be new, hopefully avoiding issues. Did the shipping company tell you about the light changes, or did you find out some other way?"
Switzerland,2owo3f,knpee,2,Thu Dec 11 07:12:51 2014 UTC,"Sorry for the slow reply. The company I used was I Luv Moving (http://www.yelp.com/biz/i-love-international-moving-los-angeles-3). Here is what I can tell you about them...  Before we signed with them they were super responsive and helpful. One of the guys came by our apartment to look at everything we were going to ship and give us a firm estimate. The nice thing is that you will not pay more than the estimate even if it ends up costs the movers more to ship it (unless you add more boxes after the estimate of course). They were also flexible in price... I got a cheaper quite from a shittier company, and I luv moving ended up matching it when I mentioned it.  The estimated delivery time was 7 weeks, which turned out to be pretty accurate. The quote they gave us was for door to door service. That means we just had to put the lose items into boxes, and then professional movers came in and packed and loaded all the furniture, etc. They also picked up the car at my apartment and drove it to the port of long beach themselves. On the Swiss side everything was delivered directly to my new apartment. Unloading was also included in the price, but there were two stipulations. They had to be able to park the truck within 50m of the entrance, and they would only carry furniture up two flights of stairs. If your apartment is higher up you'll probably pay extra. Finally, the quote also includes 30 days of free storage at the origin port if thats something you need. The storage was very handy because in our case we did not have an apartment in Switzerland lined up, and we did not want the stuff to show up without anywhere to pit it.  They were also supposed to handle all of the customs legwork, which didn't turn out that way (but was still pretty easy). The US moving company sub contracts the various parts of the delivery to other companies. That means someone like Schumacher Logistics (one of the largest in Europe, I think) will truck your belongings from whatever European port your stuff arrives at to Basel, where it will go through customs. This was really the worst part of the experience because there was apparently no clear communication between I Luv Moving and the local delivery company. The delivery company had me fill out the Swiss customs forms again (which was very easy) and harassed me about their payment a few times. If that happens to you just tell them to talk to the US shipping company if you have an all inclusive deal with them. This part really was't so bad, but it just resulted in a lot of back and fort phone calls and some additional paperwork. Once all the papers were in order, clearing customs was no problem at all.  As far as the car goes, you should be aware that no Swiss insurance company will insure it until you have passed inspection and have Swiss plates. If you can convince your US auto insurance to add a specialty insurance that gives you coverage you can drive your car with the US plates in Switzerland for up to one year (as long as your US registration is valid the entire time). The crappy thing about the inspection is that many cantons have a fairly substantial backlog, and you can't schedule an appointment until you have a ""Stammnummer"" for your car. And you don't get that number until the car clears Swiss customs. So that means that your car could be sitting in your driveway for a month without you being able to drive it.  The moving company did not give me any indication of what was required for inspection in Switzerland. They specifically said that all they do is move the stuff and handle customs. Making sure the car is legal to import into Switzerland was my responsibility. With that having been said, if you know what Kanton you are going to I would just call up the Strasenverkersamt and ask them if you have questions. Especially if you are in a smaller Kanton this should not be an issue. If you want to make this process easier you may want to contact the manufacturer of your car, or the Swiss general importer of the brand, and ask them for a European manufacturer shield. If you get one of those it should list all specs of your car, which will simplify the inspection process. In my case I had no such shield, so the inspection place sent me a list of the data they needed, and I sent them pictures of the various tags on the car that were relevant. Not sure if that works everywhere (again, I moved to a small Canton, so they probably have more time on their hands), but the guy at the Strasenverkersamt was very knoledable and knew immediately that the California Emissions data I sent him complied with EU norms."
Switzerland,2owo3f,1BitcoinOrBust,1 point,Fri Dec 12 09:16:38 2014 UTC,"Regarding insurance: We drove our car with california plates for nearly 9 months and were continuously insured through Basler (balois.ch). They only needed the stammnummer, which we got along with the customs paperwork when the car came through."
Switzerland,2owo3f,Kapensteijn,3,Thu Dec 18 00:46:25 2014 UTC,"My boss imported a new Ford Mustang a couple years ago. He told me it was quite a hassle. Moving it across the pond is one thing, but if you're moving anyway probably no too difficult. Then it has to be approved by the Strassenverkehrsamt (DMV). Depending on the canton this examination may be incredibly, or just very thorough. Also depends on the age of the car. Expect to pay a hefty fee everywhere. (approximately 1000-2000CHF)   I would only make the effort for a high-end car that's less than 3 years old with low mileage. Otherwise there's a chance the Strassenverkehrsamt doesn't allow it in the first place without even looking.  I don't know the price differences between US and Swiss cars, but I'd expect you'd have to reserve at least 5000CHF for the entire operation. Also consider resale value in Europe.  I moved to Switzerland last year, and also looked to import my car. Decided not to do it because it was too old. You do need to have it for at least 6 months in order to not pay additional taxes. All the forms and requirements on the internet can be a bit overwhelming, so I'd also advise to call a Strassenverkehrsamt if you really want to make sure everything goes as planned."

Switzerland,2owo3f,Raclette,2,Thu Dec 11 07:29:27 2014 UTC,"No direct experience, but my boss imported his car from CA to Switzerland no problem. You get one year to do it (and any other moving-related stuff, iirc). A CA car shouldn't need to be modified significantly because the smog and safety standards are the highest in the world! You may need to have the electronics changed a bit (e.g., when the parking lights on cars come on), but nothing major.  If the car is like the rest of the ""importing for moving"" rules, you need to own it for some time period (either 6 months or a year) for it to count under this tax-free thing.  I wanted to take my car to CH with me (from Calif.), but a tuned WRX uses a crapload of gas (plus parts are hella pricey!). I remember some company quoted me a price around $3k if I drove it to their port in SoCal (and they would ship it to Geneva). Price was for volume, not weight, so I could have packed it with all the stuff I wanted."
Switzerland,2owo3f,Solitaire_Nemesis,1 point,Wed Dec 10 22:13:46 2014 UTC,Thanks :) That comment on the price being per volume makes it really interesting!
Switzerland,2owo3f,squigfried,1 point,Thu Dec 11 07:26:06 2014 UTC,"When you ship stuff each cubic m3 = x kilograms, they charge you whatever is the most ""heavy"" of the two (an empty 1 m3 box would be charged as 300kg even it actually weighed only 1kg). The car is more voluminous than heavy so you pay for the volume which means that you are probably paying a lot more than the weight of the car. It's generally 300kg/m3 so it means you probably pay about 10m3 for a car = 3000kg even if the car weighs only half that. That's why it's very expensive to ship certain products, sometimes the shipping costs a lot more than the product itself."
Switzerland,2owo3f,1BitcoinOrBust,2,Thu Dec 11 19:07:24 2014 UTC,"I would say that it is not worth it in most cases. I had a Mustang in CA, and looked into bringing it back when I moved. It turns out that between all the things I would have had to change (from the tires to the lights and even the exhaust) and the administrative hassle, I would still have had trouble in the winter due to the lack of a corrosion resistant coating on the undercarriage and the need for snow tires. I would only recommend it if the same model or something very similar is currently being sold in Switzerland for a much higher price than in the US, if you absolutely have to drive that model, if you recently bought your car (> than 6 months or you'll have to pay the import taxes), and that it still has very low mileage (>10000 miles).  In most other cases it is not worth it. For cool american cars, you will run into the following problems:  -Homologation and associated part replacement costs -High annual taxes (based on curb weight and power) -High gas prices -High insurance for exotic cars -Moving costs -Getting help in the future when you have a problem with the car.  When I looked into it, moving was the easy part! Had I decided to do it, my movers would have been able to bring the car for a relatively low amount in addition to the rest of my stuff. Moving cost is not really proportional to volume/weight. Once you decide to move things with a container, you might as well cram as much stuff as you can in that portion of container you are using! It would have been an additional ~2000$ for me. If your car is not a standard car being sold in Switzerland, the homologation will be time consuming and most likely expensive (exotic Mustang: check). There are people that will organize this for you, but they are pricey. I was quoted ~7000$+moving+taxes.  In addition to that, I would look into swiss taxes (https://www.ch.ch/en/vehicle-tax) - CHF1100/year for me. Also ask for an insurance quote (https://en.comparis.ch/auto/) - CHF1500/year for me. And finally call a few garages to see if they would be willing to help you with your american car (claim you are already here and have an issue that needs fixing now, other wise they'll just say yes regardless ;) )    Doing a few of those things will make you realize that every time you need to do something linked to bureaucracy you will have to jump though a bunch of extra hoops because you don't have a standard car. Do you really want to deal with this every few months?  I also realized it would become a hassle to sell the car in Switzerland. For me, that was the deciding factor, and once I got over it I realized how much of a pain all the rest of those issue were. My final recommendation: sell your car, and get excited by buying a different car here!"

We've been together for 5 years and have no marriage plans. If you are not married you have to prove that you are in a committed relationship for roughly 2-3 years prior to your move. You also have to provide documentation of your relationship through pictures, bills or leases from places you've lived together, etc. One of the stipulations for her to move to Swiss is that you become her benefactor, kind of like liability, for roughly 30000 chf. One big problem is that she won't be allowed to work unless she is sponsored for a work visa from a company that can hire non EU persons. To qualify for something like this she has to display a specific work skill that can't be filled by someone who is Swiss/EU. My girlfriend has lived here for a year and has yet to find work in Swiss. I don't know if a yoga studio would sponsor something like this, but possibly pre-natal therapy would be a niche that could eventually help get her job.   You really need to contact migration.

It is what I did when I was in your situation about a year and a half ago.  There might be some special visa like what you described, but my guess it the guarantee will be something pretty extreme, like the investor visa where you need a couple hundred grand in the bank."
Switzerland,2oufyh,blackkettle,3,Wed Dec 10 10:49:07 2014 UTC,"These are great answers, thank you! Would it be better to start with the Zurich migration office or the federal one?"
Switzerland,2oufyh,Motzlord,2,Wed Dec 10 12:56:48 2014 UTC,I would go for the one in Zürich because they would be the one handling you if you reside there. At least AFAIK.
Switzerland,2oufyh,futurespice,3,Wed Dec 10 08:20:58 2014 UTC,"You need to talk to Zurich and if you get an unhelpful person try again at a different time.  My experience was 50% of the time I got a really helpful person who provided pragmatic advice, and 50% of the time I got a grumpy person who told me to fill out a form and then come back."

Switzerland,2oufyh,renner2,1 point,Wed Dec 10 10:59:30 2014 UTC,It depends on the nature of the work permit.  3rd country nationals often get an L permit for 2 years in Zurich even with unlimited employment.  In our case my spouse also got an L permit.
Switzerland,2ouf99,spededa,1 point,Wed Dec 10 07:24:38 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback!   Why don't you just apply for the new job and tell them you currently have another job   The issue is that I have a firm offer from the new company. It's not about applying to see if I might get the job. They have laid out the terms and are basically waiting for an answer. I could ask them to wait, but they are looking for someone as soon as possible. I have a feeling they would not wait around for me if someone else who is qualified comes along. I am also not sure that there is any value to the company I already signed with if I already know that I'd be leaving after 30 days. They would pay my salary for a month and get very little value in return (because of training, etc). To me that feels like starting at the job I signed with would be the nice thing to do, but it doesn't benefit anyone involved, or am I wrong?   You will get a very bad letter of recommendation   I wasn't too concerned about this, but should I be? I figured that the letter of recommendation doesn't matter much since I already have a new job. And if I am applying to other jobs in the future I would be using the letter of recommendation of the new company, not the old one I would have never actually worked at. But to be honest, I don't really understand how the ""Arbeitszeugnise"", etc work here. Could a future employer get such a document even if I don't provide it myself or list the company as a reference?   also they could sue you for compensation if you just quit.   Does that mean damages they incur because I backed out? For example recruitment costs for finding a replacement, etc, or are you talking about something else?  Thanks again!"
Switzerland,2ouf99,Urgullibl,2,Wed Dec 10 07:54:53 2014 UTC,Thank you!   It sounds like you have not even started working for the first company.   That is correct. I am looking to get out of the contract before I have started my first day of work.
Switzerland,2ouf99,markus_b,3,Wed Dec 10 08:37:46 2014 UTC,"I would call them, tell them of your situation, and ask them to either match the other offer or let you go ""fristlos"". It's the better scenario for both parties than you starting and then handing in one month's notice on your first day. Edit: Actually, I wonder whether you could hand in your notice before you even start, which would be advantageous in this situation.  You should do this ASAP though to allow your other ""employer"" to find a replacement in time."
Switzerland,2ouf99,futurespice,2,Wed Dec 10 09:03:19 2014 UTC,"But he could see a gap in your CV or note that there is an Arbeitszeugnis missing from one Job. And a missing Arbeitszeugnis is probably worse than a bad one. How long have you had your current Job?   I have not started the job yet. I am supposed to start in January. So there wouldn't be a gap in my resume at all since the new company wants me to start pretty much right away.   Yes, something along this. But I have no personal experience. Imagine if your Employer just stopped fulfilling his contractual obligation (ie. not paying your salary for example. You would sue them too.   Yes that makes a lot of sense. But at the same time allowing me to get out of the contract seems like it would be the best option for the employer given that I have not even started work yet. Since it is a highly technical job that will require a fair amount of training they would get no value out of me if they know I'll be leaving after 30 days anyway. Meanwhile they would still have to pay my salary."
Switzerland,2ouf99,huazzy,2,Wed Dec 10 10:40:57 2014 UTC,"If you are sure that you don't want to start the job, then I'd call them and told them. They may throw a fit on the phone and hate you for life.   If you tell them that you found something better fitting for you and that you would quit end of january anyway, I suppose they would just leave it at that."
Switzerland,2ouf99,Zenistar,2,Wed Dec 10 14:55:25 2014 UTC,"When would you have to start at the first company?  In practical terms there are unlikely to be consequences beyond severe reputational damage with the first company, unless you are in a very small industry in which case it's worse."

Switzerland,2ot3bt,alexandrustr,6,Tue Dec 9 23:40:00 2014 UTC,"it depends on what type of job you have.  Ive been threatened for similar stuff, but thats very unprofessional.  Personally I would start looking for a new job and leave there as soon as I got one.  There is two types of overtime (Überzeit and Überstunden) and they get compensated differently.  You probably have to work like 40 to 42 hours a week. This is normal work time. Everything more than that up to a total of 45 (which is maximum work time according to law) counts as Überzeit. Everything more than 45 counts as Überstunden.  Now theres a lot of contract stuff that covers compensation but generally you cant compensate Überzeit as easily as Überstunden.  Überstunden have to be compensated for either money (your hourly rate plus a minimum of 25%) or free days at least as much as your Überstunden, but only if you both agree to that.  And I dont know how it is in other countries but in Switzerland you can get fired for bogus causes pretty easily (you still have some protection, they cant fire you without notice (according to your contract) unless you stole something or attacked someone or similar."
Switzerland,2ot3bt,swarmspider,1 point,Wed Dec 10 06:06:14 2014 UTC,"I know you don't want to print out the law chapter. But for the sake of completeness: Art. 321c Code of obligations (Obligationenrecht)     If more hours of work are required than envisaged under the employment contract or provided for by custom, standard employment contract or collective employment contract, the employee is obliged to perform such overtime to the extent that he is able and may conscionably be expected to do so. In consultation with the employee, the employer may compensate him within an appropriate period for the overtime worked by granting him time off in lieu of at least equal length. Where the overtime is not compensated by time off in lieu and unless otherwise agreed in writing or under a standard employment contract or collective employment contract, the employer must compensate the employee for the overtime worked by paying him his normal salary and a supplement of at least one-quarter thereof."
Switzerland,2ot3bt,himbeerli,2,Thu Dec 11 23:35:40 2014 UTC,"Does your employer has an HR department? I've heard a lot of weird stories like yours where the boss is oblivious about what he can and can't do, but HR has to set him straight.  I do have quite some overtime myself, but my contract states that I have to compensate by myself. I can just tell my boss I go home earlier some days or come in late. I'm probably lucky with that since my employer is easy-going with that as long as I'm at the meetings and I get my work done in time. So I don't get money for overtime.  And yes, Switzerland has rather lax laws when it comes to employee protection. It's relatively easy to fire you compared to Germany or France for instance."
Switzerland,2ot3bt,P1r4nha,1 point,Wed Dec 10 07:39:16 2014 UTC,I asked HR for the procedure of compensating overtime as cash and they said it's not possible and that I should take it as time off and sent me a link with the employee code. Just underneath the phrase they quoted it said that  if I can't (or don't want to) I can take my overtime as cash. I responded to them with the paragraph and requested the procedure again. They said they do not compensate overtime as cash and CCed someone two positions above me.
Switzerland,2ot3bt,frozenbubble,2,Wed Dec 10 08:29:03 2014 UTC,That's fairly common and sounds pretty legit to me. You can only be paid for your overtime if your manager allows it. This is an extra budget position in his forecast. That might lead to have him answer questions to his manager. Etc.
Switzerland,2ot3bt,buyacasha,3,Wed Dec 10 09:52:19 2014 UTC,"That is true but each project has its own forecast, recovery rate, milestones and estimated hours. For each hour that I work, the client is billed for and revenue (or extra revenue) is made. Unless you work a fixed budget project which is not the case at the moment, having extra worked hours will bring you more revenue and if you don't pay out the extra time to your employees that's revenue with little cost associated to it."
Switzerland,2ot3bt,frozenbubble,2,Wed Dec 10 11:21:37 2014 UTC,"In addition to what the others have said, there are also ""Kaderstellen"" (Management position) without any overtime. This usually means that you have a high base salary but are then expected to work additional hours. But since you did not mention that, I assume this is not what you have.  On topic: What industry are you in? I'd actually start looking for a better job because your employer sounds like an ass."
Switzerland,2ot3bt,frozenbubble,2,Wed Dec 10 07:48:40 2014 UTC,"I do not have a management position nor do I get any sort of bonus at the end of the year. The last company that I worked for I had racked up 6-7 months of overtime in 3 years. That has never been paid out and it did take a toll on my health. I don't want this to happen again.  I work in the financial sector doing forensics, fraud detection/prevention and anti-moneylaundering."
Switzerland,2ot3bt,markus_b,2,Wed Dec 10 08:32:51 2014 UTC,Yep...
Switzerland,2ot3bt,buyacasha,3,Wed Dec 10 08:54:14 2014 UTC,Paying will make you heal quicker? Just take the days off. Better for everyone
Switzerland,2ot3bt,futurespice,1 point,Wed Dec 10 08:56:51 2014 UTC,"These are not ""days off"" they are ""days on-call"" where you can't do anything but have your phone with you and be ready to get to the office in 1 hour. I have a 30-45 minute commute to work and I need to be there in a suit. I can't sleep late because 1 hour is not enough to get ready and go to work; it's like saying you're free but walk around with a bracelet around with a bracelet around your ankles.  Paying is compensated 1:1.25 where time off is 1:1. Do you feel that staying late for several weeks/weekends can be compensated 1:1 as time off? You're making an effort to stay longer and concentrate on what you're doing rather than relaxing or doing something else. That's why I believe believe that you have to go for the 1:1.25 compensation."
Switzerland,2ot3bt,Maheu,2,Wed Dec 10 09:55:12 2014 UTC,"Do you feel that staying late for several weeks/weekends can be compensated 1:1 as time off?   Yes. I don't know about those days on-call, those sound sketchy to me. I worked several years in an management position and I never granted paying compensation for any kind of overtime. To be frank, you should have talked to your manager along the way racking up all those hours. Not working in a mgmt position and still you have time mgmt system actually tells me, that there's a whole lot more wrong."

You can do that even after you have left the job, but within 10 years or so (not sure about the delays).  Documentation is crucial, though."

For example upc-cablecom.ch. If a technician says that the machine might be overloaded then he can probably check the machine himself.   A fun server to ping would probably be hsi.upc-cablecom.ch since it contains their speedtest website.  Pinging google and cdn servers is generally a bad idea since these ips are multihomed and depending on the location the traceroute might look different. Google also does some fancy stuff with icmp. Looking at your traceroute it seems that its either your router, the link between your router and cablecom endpoint, or the cablecom endpoint.   Have you tried setting your modem to bridged mode?

Onedrive on my Nas synced 3 files, then stopped for 2-3 hours and resumed syncing another 3 files.  After trying various resolutions, I tried a VPN in Zuerich, and everything was absolutely fine again. Onedrive works like it should, torrent speed is up. I did some research, but I could not find any information about Cablecom throttling certain traffic.   Those issues appeared about 3 weeks ago. Has anybody else experienced something like that? Maybe I am the only one and I just messed up a config on my router or Nas, but having all my problems solved with a VPN makes a little suspicious."

Visa requirements depend on citizenship, not residence. If you are a US citizen, you won't need a visa to enter Switzerland as a tourist, and if you're arriving from another Schengen country, you won't have to go through passport control. If you are an Indian citizen, you will need a valid visa for Switzerland or another Schengen country.  The National Museum is right next to the main station, so that might be an idea for a stopover."
Switzerland,2oneu9,Urgullibl,2,Mon Dec 8 17:56:25 2014 UTC,"Travelling is way easier than in India.

Switzerland,2oneu9,YeaISeddit,2,Tue Dec 9 01:22:14 2014 UTC,"Depends on the time of year. I presume this is in the winter. Just have a walk through the city and along the lake. Swiss cities aren't going to blow you away with huge monuments, palaces, and museums. I recommend you go to the main train station (Zürich HB) then take the Polybahn (a funicular that takes you up to the ETH Zürich). Here's the route to the Polybahn from the HB (map). Then one you've taken in the view from the Polyterrase (view) go back down the Polybahn and take a walk down Niederdorfstrasse. Once you get bored (shouldn't take long) have a seat and enjoy one of Switzerland's beers and people watch for a bit. I would also recommend walking down to the lakefront for a bit if you're up for a longer walk."
Switzerland,2oneu9,Prevent_SplashBack,2,Tue Dec 9 13:33:56 2014 UTC,"Lucerne in the winter is beautiful, and that would be a quick train ride from ZRH. And the main station is right in the middle of town, where there's a lot of really neat things to see and do.    Use sbb.ch (there's a button at the top right to switch languages), and plan your route.  You can set your watch to the swiss trains, so I wouldn't expect any hiccups or delays.  And if you have the app and an internet-enabled device, you can buy your ticket right on your phone to save time and hassle at the ticket machine/counter."
Switzerland,2oneu9,sosoniko,2,Tue Dec 9 13:49:07 2014 UTC,"I recommend Rapperswil, a nice downtown area and the lake looks beautiful from there this time of the year. It's about an hour from ZRH"
Switzerland,2omhiu,BigPhat,4,Mon Dec 8 06:28:27 2014 UTC,I was 3 month in a language school in the us and I just used my maestro card to get cash from the atm which is not too expensive as long as you don't only get 20$ each time. for paying random stuff get a credit card or if you don't qualify for one get a prepaid cc. having a cc in the us is very convenient because you just have to swipe your card
Switzerland,2omhiu,Eldona,3,Mon Dec 8 09:59:35 2014 UTC,"This. As far as I remember, Maestro withdrawals have a fixed fee, whereas CC have a fee based on the amount you withdraw. Thus small amounts are best paid by CC, bigger withdrawals by Maestro."
Switzerland,2omhiu,buyacasha,3,Mon Dec 8 10:09:00 2014 UTC,"I went on vacation to the US last summer and got a free prepaid credit card in USD at Credit Suisse. There's probably some upper limit on what you can prepay onto it, but it should definitely get you through day-to-day use with a few thousand CHF/USD. If you want to transfer > 10k, you probably have to look for other alternatives."
Switzerland,2omhiu,ThePadawan,3,Mon Dec 8 14:15:29 2014 UTC,Been studying in the US for 5 years now (high school + college). I have a Citibank student account and debit card. No overdraft fees and no monthly payments. In essence a student account is 100% free. I have a UBS account too but you might want to tell them that you're going to the US because they blocked my card after a few transactions. I was still able to transfer money to my American account. Transferring/withdrawing in the US with CHF is very advantageous because of the exchange rate and the price of living.
Switzerland,2omhiu,batador,3,Mon Dec 8 15:52:59 2014 UTC,"Use transferwise. It's by far the best way to transfer money. I'm a Canadian living and working in Switzerland and transfer money back to Canada every month. I've tried paypal, bank transfers, and most recently transferwise. With transferwise I got about 10% better exchange rates and less fees. Can't recommend it enough."

Switzerland,2omhiu,086,1 point,Tue Dec 9 04:33:12 2014 UTC,That looks interesting. I'm also in a similar situation. But just one short question. The website mentions sending CHF is only possible within CHF and LIE. So I guess you exchange to Canadian dollars first and send it then?
Switzerland,2omhiu,CaptIncorrect,1 point,Tue Dec 9 13:39:55 2014 UTC,Nope. They exchanged it. I sent them CHF and they deposited CAD in my Canadian account.
Switzerland,2omhiu,buyacasha,5,Wed Dec 10 08:09:05 2014 UTC,"I would simply bring my Maestro cards and avoid the hassle with having a US account. The fee's really aren't that high. Make sure though to both increase your limit if necessary and to enable withdrawals in the US, since banks usually block withdrawals in foreign countries by default."
Switzerland,2omhiu,netheranthem,3,Mon Dec 8 07:17:52 2014 UTC,You often can't use Maestros in the US... so that wouldn't really work.
Switzerland,2omhiu,YeaISeddit,3,Mon Dec 8 07:50:28 2014 UTC,"They just work at ATMs. If you use a pin enabled Visa card then you will be fine in most places. People will look at you like a crazy person when they realize that your credit card needs a pin, but most machines are nevertheless enabled for this sort of thing.   Since it hasn't been mentioned. I think the big problem with opening an American bank account is the hassle you will go through in Switzerland. Once you open an American bank account, your Swiss bank is going to start giving you a lot of annoying paperwork to fill out. It might be a huge pain in the ass to get done from abroad. Lots of international certified mail and what not. I'd stick with the Swiss account and get a credit card. Everyone pays for everything with credit cards in the USA."
Switzerland,2omhiu,netheranthem,3,Mon Dec 8 08:12:12 2014 UTC,"A few (if not most) banks will not let you withdraw in the US with your Maestro. It is recent, so I don't know when you did that... but maybe it is no longer working."
Switzerland,2omhiu,buyacasha,3,Mon Dec 8 08:51:27 2014 UTC,I've travelled to the US many times and as far as I remember never had problems with withdrawing from ATMs.

Switzerland,2omhiu,Urgullibl,2,Tue Dec 9 05:17:18 2014 UTC,"If you want to open a US bank account, you'll have to prove that you're in the country legally (easy enough with the valid visa in your passport), and they probably will also want to see some sort of proof of address (rental contract, utility bills addressed to you etc.) For six months, it's probably worth to also apply for a Social Security Number, which will make any interactions with banks, insurance and government agencies a lot easier.  Make sure that your bank is FDIC insured, which covers accounts up to $250k in case of the bank going under. I'd recommend going with one of the many available ""Credit Unions"", which are a similar setup to Swiss Raiffeisen banks.   Once you have the account, you can just do a wire transfer from your Swiss account. Then you can get a US-based debit and/or credit card  (using European-based cards can be a big hassle, especially at gas stations that want you to enter your ZIP code). You will also be issued a check book -- checks are still a fairly popular means of payment in the US, so it's handy to also have access to them if need be.  You may also want to consider getting a pay-as-you-go cell phone with monthly contract renewal. AT&T offers plans for 40$ a month for 500 minutes, plus 5$ a month for 200 minutes of calls to Europe."
Switzerland,2omhiu,_Pasc,2,Mon Dec 8 18:18:21 2014 UTC,"I'm currently doing my exchange semester which will sadly come to and end next week.   You can pay practically everything with credit cards (even tiny amounts like vending machines), so make sure you get a CC that has a low penalty on international withdrawals. I got mine from SBB (with a halbtax included) and they are among the lowest.   For bigger transactions like rent I'm using moneyorders. They work kind of like cheques, which you can purchase in nearly every grocery store/7eleven for a small fee (1-2$) and send it to the receiver per post.   So it wasn't really necessary for me to make an american bank account. If you have any more questions, I'm glad to help."
Switzerland,2omhiu,P1r4nha,2,Wed Dec 10 16:48:59 2014 UTC,"I'd ask your banks if they have some special deal for you, if not I'd be looking into PayPal for transferring money. It's not as awesome as Swiss banks, but a lot better than anything American banks will offer you. At least as far as I know.  Otherwise you'll need a credit card most of the time anyway and I'm pretty sure you'll be able to use it regardless of where your actual bank account is."
Switzerland,2omhiu,netheranthem,2,Mon Dec 8 07:37:30 2014 UTC,Credit cards are probably the safest bet. At worst you can even get cash at an ATM with them (but the fees are like 10 francs)

Switzerland,2omhiu,pseudoRndNbr,3,Mon Dec 8 16:13:54 2014 UTC,At the moment you use bitcoin because you see its potential if you use it on a daily bases.  As a business however you pay less fees if your clients pay in bitcoin than with a credit card.
Switzerland,2omhiu,skleronom,1 point,Mon Dec 8 16:48:47 2014 UTC,No I meant the ATM's. Surely they have a fee for converting bitcoin to cash?
Switzerland,2omhiu,pseudoRndNbr,2,Mon Dec 8 16:51:02 2014 UTC,Yes they have a fee. Depends on who owns the ATM though. I've seen from 0% to 5%. Some people wanna make a quick buck others are looking to promote bitcoin. That's why I said you don't use bitcoin on a daily basis because it's easy or cheap. You use it because you believe in it. Once the need for bitcoin to cash changing is eliminated because businesses accept bitcoin by default the big saving can begin. Virtually free instantaneous encrypted transactions.

They both start by a 2-3hour walk alongside the glacier, at the end of which you can have a break to eat something or go down to the glacier. Then (you'd have to walk back up if walked down to the glacier) you can either take the long hike around the mountain to catch a glimpse of other mountains and even another glacier, or take a short tunnel through the mountain going directly to the other side, which offers a breathtaking view as well. I did it with a large group of approximately 130 students, and break included it took us probably 7 hours.

On top of the Grammont you have a really nice view on the Lac Léman (Geneva's Lake) and the Plaine du Rhone! And halfway to the top there's a really nice Lake (Lac Tanney) where you can take a swimm and do barbecue.  Second one is a nice Motorbike tour but even by car you can get a really nice scenery (Or by bike if you're really into it).  Here is an itinerary  The Lac d'Hongrin is really beautiful in summer. There's a little barrage where you can go on by a small road along the lake.  Then I usually go to the Château de Gruyères and it's Bourg where there is a lot of restaurant where you can eat typical food such as Fondue or Chalet Soup!  If you want to do additionnal activites you can go to Chateau-d'Oex which is not far away from the itinerary I gave you (there's also a lot of good restaurants there) and is quite pretty.  An other option is to go Broc where you can visit the Cailler Chocolate factory (there is degusation IIRC).

That's considered to be admirable. Not saying we should turn into Americans but it sometimes really goes a bit too far.  This is like when it was a scandal that the guy that manages a 25 billion pension fund earns 400k. Every partner at a law or audit firm makes this kind of money, that's not even a top management salary in banking. But no, lets hire some incompetent idiot for 250k so that he can make stupid decisions that cost the pension fund millions as long as we save 150k on his salary...

They wouldn't be taken seriously - outside the country at least - if they were driving around in a Nissan Leaf. It's not a priori obvious which of the Nissan Leaf or the Tesla Model S is the most expensive, taking into account fuel, maintenance, repairs, etc. Compared to the cost - and more importantly the value - of a Federal Councillor, the potential difference in cost between these two vehicles is largely warranted by point 1."

In that regard, Maurer (as well as others such as Minger, Ritschard, Ogi and so on) has achieved more than 99.9% of university graduates ever will."
Switzerland,2od4c0,whitepalms85,0,Sun Dec 7 18:25:33 2014 UTC,"If I don't like it, I'll just take my business elsewhere.    Well do what you want but you get what you pay for. Good people can earn high salaries so they take the jobs that pay such salaries. If you pay below market rate, you get below market quality. The current salary is absurdly low.   Our lack of respect for academic degrees and the fact that you can have an excellent career in this country without being a university graduate is another of the things that makes it great.    But we're not talking about the economy as a whole here. Yes, it makes more sense that certain jobs have a more applied education instead of everyone studying at the university for no reason but that's certainly not true for Federal Counsels. That's not a plumbing job, you should be extremely smart and very well educated.   In that regard, Maurer (as well as others such as Minger, Ritschard, Ogi and so on) has achieved more than 99.9% of university graduates ever will.   That makes absolutely no sense. These people are still idiots. Just because there are enough idiots to vote for them doesn't proof anything, rather the opposite actually. It's absurd to have such people in charge just so that other people that never went to university can feel good. Seriously, nowadays not studying just means you're lazy. You can study part-time, there's all kind of education, deciding to stay uneducated is a choice and it's not a good one.   Our lack of respect for academic degrees   Well, I rather have lack of respect of lazy people such as people that were too lazy for education and now have to blame the others to feel better. It's also called ignorance."
Switzerland,2od4c0,Urgullibl,2,Sun Dec 7 20:09:49 2014 UTC,"you get what you pay for.   Low taxes, excellent security and a stable economy. Not bad. If you want to call Maurer, Minger, Ritschard and Ogi idiots, be my guest. You're only making yourself look ridiculous by doing so. Who is or isn't an idiot is measured by their achievements, not their education.   I rather have lack of respect of lazy people such as people that were too lazy for education   Or, you know, driven people who actually wanted to achieve something regardless of the number of letters surrounding their names.   FYI, I have a doctorate. Which, again, isn't relevant, but there you go."

Just because Switzerland is doing well over all doesn't mean that everything is good and/or can't be improved. That makes no sense.   If you want to call Maurer, Minger, Ritschard and Ogi idiots, be my guest.    I don't know about the other two, but for Ogi and especially for Maurer it's very true. This guy isn't smart at all.    Who is or isn't an idiot is measured by their achievements, not their education.   Kissing the ass of a billionaire isn't an achievement. That's the whole point I'm making: You can't become a Federal Counsel without ever having achieved anything.   Or, you know, driven people who actually wanted to achieve something regardless of the number of letters surrounding their names.    What's positive about people that want to achieve something without gaining knowledge about it?! That sounds totally stupid. It's not about letters, it's about knowledge."
Switzerland,2od4c0,Urgullibl,2,Sun Dec 7 21:12:16 2014 UTC,"You're rather silly. Of course things can be improved, but they won't be improved by paying the government more money. They will be improved by making the public sector more efficient. You see, serving in elected public office shouldn't just be another line of work -- rather, it is an honor, not something you want to make attractive to people who just care about getting the biggest possible paycheck out of it. We would be well-advised to elect humble people with a sense of duty, and for the most part, that is still the case.  The idea that Maurer or Ogi aren't smart people is demonstrably wrong (and quite honestly, not knowing the other two isn't exactly a testament to your expertise on the topic). They, as well as the other two, have all had very successful careers despite coming from humble backgrounds, and I'm rather confident in stating that they all would have shunned or still shun ostentatious displays of luxury like the one linked in this thread.  The idea that knowledge comes from studying at universities is a little naïve. Chances are you're gonna grow out of it eventually though."
Switzerland,2od4c0,whitepalms85,0,Sun Dec 7 22:40:50 2014 UTC,"Of course things can be improved, but they won't be improved by paying the government more money.    yeah, it's not like they are in charge of it or something...   You see, serving in elected public office shouldn't just be another line of work -- rather, it is an honor, not something you want to make attractive to people who just care about getting the biggest possible paycheck out of it.    Okay, that was a entertaining fantasy story, I almost could see our brave politicians riding horse back to protect our freedom but now back to reality: Federal Counsels are already underpaid, you're basically arguing that they shouldn't even have a proper car.    We would be well-advised to elect humble people with a sense of duty, and for the most part, that is still the case.   See, I don't think they are humble, they probably can't do any better. Honestly, in the private sector Maurer would maximum be the head of your local Migros branch. And that doesn't pay as much as Federal Counsel. Also it's quite bizarre that you assume that all people with a high salary are bad. Rather the opposite is true.   and quite honestly, not knowing the other two isn't exactly a testament to your expertise on the topic   I said that I don't know whether they were smart or not, not that I don't know them.   They, as well as the other two, have all had very successful careers despite coming from humble backgrounds   Lol, no, they didn't. I wouldn't mind if someone becomes a Federal Counsel that proved to be successful at something relevant even though they don't have any academic background. But most politicians have little to nothing to show.   I'm rather confident in stating that they all would have shunned or still shun ostentatious displays of luxury like the one linked in this thread.   So basically you're assuming that everyone that is a Federal Counsel is smart and as long as they are humble they are good?! Sorry, but that's pretty stupid. They should be judged by their performance and not by their life style (especially if it's just a Tesla, it's not like she's getting wasted at a party with Paris Hilton every weekend or so).   The idea that knowledge comes from studying at universities is a little naïve. Chances are you're gonna grow out of it eventually though.   The idea that people that didn't even bother studying the basics are very capable sound much more absurd to me. The point is that you should have the practical experience ON TOP of the academic background. It should be more like => extraordinary academic performance => proofed him/herself in practice => Federal Counsel. Sorry, but just listen to those people. Some of them don't even understand basic economics. Why would you put someone in charge of an economy that doesn't even understand economics?! That's why Maurer is doing military. That's the department where you're in charge of parades and it doesn't matter that you're an idiot. There's a reason why Maurer and Ogi are/were this department."

Should you have the desire to drive an ostentatious display of luxury, you are perfectly at liberty to buy it with your own money.

Now, and perhaps surprisingly considering this menial paycheck, we haven't this far had any problems finding people who are willing to do the job.

What links all of my four examples together was that they knew that money does not grow on trees and needs to be managed carefully. It's tempting to stray from this if you think it isn't yours. But it is, in the most direct sense imaginable, and I am under the impression that most of them remember that. Maurer being a CPA by profession probably doesn't hurt.  I am of course not assuming that every Federal Councillor is smart -- in fact, quite a few of them were idiots of the highest order.

I have a friend who is a PhD in rheology and is in the same situation: The positions are not posted and they have to ""create"" his position first. It's not easy.  Also apparently it helps to make industry contacts during your PhD and find a good balance between research and industry work.

Switzerland,2o87je,anonlymouse,8,Thu Dec 4 04:02:48 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure the title and the setup agree with the arguments in the article.  To me it seems like the author is putting both, the green excuse of the Ecopoppers and actual green policies in the same corner, but then describing how different their positions are anyway. And thus kinda making the case for the Green's argument that Ecopop wasn't green in the first place.  There is no real argument why the two parties are put in the same pot, except for both of them calling themselves ""green/eco"". The surprise then is that the conclusion suggests the opposite. The same name seems to be the only reason why, in the author's opinion, both green policies and Ecopop are bad ideas. The same arguments that the Green party used are used to reject Ecopop, but then the Green party is rejected without making any new arguments.    To me the author seems to preach to the choir of the young FDP/Libertarian group without actually making their own case.  But instead of just leaving this criticism here, let me make my own case, unlike the author does:  Green policies have always been about sustainability. Instead of ""finding the whole of humanity appalling"" green policies are about sustainable growth that allows for a thriving society without leaving bad consequences for other (poorer/younger/yet unborn) people to be dealt with. It accepts this challenge as something hard, but doable and I personally see progress, the economy and technology as important factors in solving this challenge. Stifling growth and progress in general does not solve the problem.  During the Ecopop campaign we realized that the leader of Ecopop is dreaming about a Switzerland where everybody can build their own little houses on their own little properties (kind of like the American dream), while totally ignoring the fact that city dwellers have a much smaller carbon footprint that people living in his dream world. This goes hand in hand with the Libertarian philosophy of not having to take responsibility for your own neighbor and, in general, for society at large. Of course you're ""more free"" if you have your own property with your own house, but you're also causing more costs when it comes to providing the infrastructure you'll be relying on either way. Of course we can also start providing for ourselves: We could all be farmers and grow and breed our food ourselves. Heat our houses ourselves with wood we found in the forest next to our properties. That would mean even more space and resources every single one of us would need. But admittedly, it would also mean that you are more independent and free of other people.  I don't know how far the freedom loving people want to take this, but at some point you have to realize that the technology and many resources we use in everyday life today are the products of a functional society. This is why I don't understand this negativity towards society. Our lifestyle is literally the direct product of a contributing society and its cost is that we have to give up some of our independence.  In the end we probably all agree that extremes aren't working out either way and thus I reject the suggestion that any green policy has to be rejected and unfettered economical growth is the way to go."
Switzerland,2o87je,P1r4nha,3,Thu Dec 4 08:30:06 2014 UTC,"The same name seems to be the only reason why, in the author's opinion, both green policies and Ecopop are bad ideas   It's not the name, it's the misanthropy. Both see humans as the problem."

But I grant you that: If you deny the existence of the problem in the first place, both of them are a bit similar by wanting to solve a problem.  Thanks, it was important for me to understand this larger connection."
Switzerland,2o87je,immerc,2,Thu Dec 4 15:46:04 2014 UTC,"city dwellers have a much smaller carbon footprint that people living in his dream world   That's one thing I've always found interesting.  The people who claim to care most about the environment love to have places to live that are surrounded by nature, and love to do activities out in nature.  But that lifestyle is much more harmful to nature than a city dweller who watches TV and goes clubbing.  Not only are apartments more energy efficient than standalone houses, but if your house is out in the middle of nowhere you have to drive to get there, and you have to drive to go to your hiking trail, and so on.  Having each person farm their own land to feed only themselves would be even less efficient, requiring even more natural resources per person than having dedicated farmers who efficiently farm big plots to feed thousands of people."
Switzerland,2o87je,P1r4nha,1 point,Thu Dec 4 12:38:10 2014 UTC,"Exactly. To go even further back in history: When we ""invented"" specializations and jobs like hunter, gatherer, healer etc. we started to become more efficient. Everybody could eat the meat, even if they spent their day gathering stuff, because the hunter provided for them. If you think about it, specialization makes humans more efficient and it allows us to house, feed and provide a high quality of life to more people with less resources. Specialization also allows us to have free time. We'd have no time to do other stuff if we had to go find food all day.  That said, if we specialize we also automatically start providing for others and start to become dependent on others to provide for us."
Switzerland,2o87je,immerc,2,Thu Dec 4 12:50:37 2014 UTC,"Definitely.  Specialisation requires you to be dependent on others and they depend on you.  That forms a community of people who support each-other (even if they don't necessarily realise it).  In some ways these interdependencies make things more brittle because a truck driver's strike over issues that you have no control over might affect the food you can buy at the supermarket.  Or a choice that a group of farmers make over the crops they choose to plant can affect what you eat without you even knowing.  On the other hand, it's also a support structure.  If you're farming only your tiny plot of land, and it has a bad year because of drought or pests, you don't starve.  If one modern farmer's land has a bad year, it might really hurt his income, but there are enough other farms spread out that it won't affect the entire community's food supply.  Oversupply thanks to production efficiencies also allows for a social safety net so that farmer isn't ruined either.  Luckily, the modern world allows you to make some choices.  If you want to be more independent, you can get a plot of land, grow some of your own food, put up solar panels to generate your own electricity, and so on.  But not everyone wants to make that choice, and it's a mistake to think that those who choose to live in a city are living a less environmentally friendly life as a result."

More people (apparently Muslims) run out of a forest. There are many of them. ""Together we are strong."" is the message.

If they were to teach people about the history of the Qu'ran and how some of the often discussed weird things that are said in it came about, then in my opinion it would be beneficial to the muslim and the general population. The problem is not that the whole religious text is flawed, but that it is very old and a lot of things said there probably made good sense two thousand years ago..."

Banning minarets is as stupid as banning church towers. I really don't see how shitting on centuries of progressive and enlightened philosophy is helping us as a society. Equality before the law and freedom of religion are important concepts.  On a side note, before the vote, supporters of a minaret-ban often used the fact the public practice of non-Muslim religions is prohibited in Saudia Arabia as an argument for banning Minarets in Switzerland. I don't get that argument, if anything, the fact that churches are forbidden in Saudia Arabia is actually an argument against the banning of minarets in Switzerland, not the other way around."

Switzerland,2o3a32,Neirdark,2,Fri Dec 5 10:35:00 2014 UTC,"The sole purpose of that video is to create segregation and hatred between the Muslim communities in Switzerland and the rest of the country. The organisation behind this video IZRS is ""allegedly"" funded via ""Gulf states"" benefactors (Saudi clerics). These types of organisations are created specifically for the sole purpose of promoting segregation and fanning ethnic and religious tension. They are also part of the vast proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, a war whose results can be seen both in Muslim lands and in Western countries.  The video is not intended for consumption by Swiss Muslims but it is intended for consumption by the general Swiss population in order to illicit a backlash against the Muslim population in Switzerland. The video is specifically designed to provoke and illicit a counter response from non Muslims towards people they identify as being Muslim.  By doing this the Wahhabi organisation IZRS creates a hostile atmosphere from the Swiss population towards the Muslim community thus creating the perfect ground's for their brand of militant Islamism and new conversions. IZRS wants the minarets to be banned forever. They want hijabs to be forbidden and are using niqab, burqa in order to shock the population. They want to see neo-nazis attacking mosques. They want the Muslim community in Switzerland to feel hated, threatened and outcasted. They win by making it impossible for normal Muslims to live a normal life in Switzerland.  They want Mosques to be burnt, as it happened recently in Flums (SG), where an Albanian mosque was attacked with Molotov cocktails, which could even be a false flag attack.  These organisation are present all over the EU and they are all funded by the same people from the same region. You probably remember the shariah police in Germany or the recent actions in London. Their goal is the same everywhere: Stop integration, increase segregation, create conditions beneficial for the spread of Wahhabism and, decrease the possibility of ""non orthodox"" interpretations of Islam.  These organisations are dangerous and they pose a direct threat towards the Muslim population living in the EU, such organisations should not be tolerated or accepted, religion should be.  I also admit that the referendum against minarets was politically motivated and launched in order to gain publicity, sadly it passed. There were already enough regulations and methods at Gemeinde/Commune level to forbid or to accept the construction of such buildings. This paranoid referendum wasn't needed at all.  I hope we could try to do something in order to control the nutjobs from both sides (IZRS and SVP). I also hope that Muslims could understand the aims and methods of such wahabi groups that don't/won't ever try to act in favor of other Islamic currents or to fight religious discrimination. They must be unanimously condemned and controlled, but not banned.  We should also clearly remember that most Jihadists are converts and are rarely born into Islam. Political and hate proselytism hidden into religion must be carefully monitored by Swiss authorities. Sadly, I don't trust them to do so and I know they aren't knowledgable enough on the subject.  Peace upon you."

Does that mean we shouldn't give Muslims the right to vote? Saudi Arabia is a theocracy, we shouldn't take example on them.  The biggest Muslim country in the world, Indonesia, allows the building of churches.   We are too liberal and tolerant.   LOL we are the most conservative country in Western Europe.

I don't think Switzerland is worse/more conservative/more xenophobic than the other western-european countries. I think the German proverb The grass is always greener on the neighbours lawn fits quite well here. Womens vote arrived very late because our democratic system is very slow and Switzerland lacks a lot of the historic context other countries who introduced it earlier had and which affected the emancipation (impact of world wars, basic political system, et al.). Gay marriage might not be legal yet, but from my experience the Swiss are tolerant towards homosexuality and homosexuals have almost equal rights  especially since the registered partnership is allowed (they still don't have some of the rights a hetero couple would have, but I hope they'll get them as soon as possible).   the places (in your canton) where the town votes to see if you can be considered swiss and if your name ends with -ic or you are Muslim you can forget it   That's just as much generalisation as saying all muslims are violent.  One thing I also disagree with is this sentence:   I'd wager it'll be majority non-religious by the end of this century, like everywhere else in Western Europe   Considering there's still quite a lot of religiosity in western Europe I think it will only partially be non-religious, religion even has potential to increase again (e.g. in times of crises, humans tend to seek religion in troubled times).

Switzerland,2o3a32,hikari-boulders,2,Tue Dec 9 07:43:10 2014 UTC,"or the Minaret ban.   I don't want to debate or reiterate the Minaret ban. I just want to tell you my experience during the discussions of the ban:  A lot of my friends knew from the beginning that they want to vote ""No"", and they also did. After the ""Yes"" was voted on the Minaret ban they had this wonderful idea. (I don't know where they got this idea from. Someone must have farted it into their brains). All of them found it a super duper idea. They saw something wrong with our voting system and the fix seemed obvious. The ""Yes"" was voted because (so  thought my friends) a lot of people assumed ""Minarett = Muezzin"" and the Muezzin will cry out 5 times a day. My friends wanted to include some form of knowledge questions to votes. For example: You can vote ""Yes"" or ""No"", and next to the vote are 2-3 simple questions like ""Do you know that BlaBla"" or ""Did you know that actually BlaBla"". The system would be super, because then only ""votes which got the answers right should be counted, all other votes should not be counted"".  I just wanted to tell you this story to show you that the ""obviously right decision"" (like a ""No"" to the Minarett ban) should not necessarily be enforcable somehow, because the consequences might be too grave. A ""bad thing"" like the Yes to the Minarett ban should be accepted as a necessity to all the good stuff we have: the directest democracy, the division of powers and concordance systems we have in place here in Switzerland."

I don't see any reason why anyone should be allowed to vote on a matter on which he or she can't even answer a simple factual, unbiased question. You could even go further and always ask 2 or 3 simple questions about our political system, for example ""Which one is bigger, Nationalrat or Ständerat?"". While the right to vote is supposed to be a basic right, I think there are some things you just have to know, to be able to be responsible for your vote. Like free speech, a basic right can definitely have its restrictions. You have the right to say whatever you want with the exception of discrimination or defamation - it could be the same way with democracy. You have the right to vote, if you can answer minimal questions."
Switzerland,2o3a32,hikari-boulders,1 point,Wed Dec 3 16:03:55 2014 UTC,"There is so much wrong with the idea of conditional voting rights (your vote only counts if you fulfill this or that), I don't even know where to start.   I don't see any reason why anyone should be allowed to vote on a matter on which he or she can't even answer a simple factual, unbiased question.   For example, let's vote on the following: ""Algorithms or representations thereof are not patentable or protectable by any means of intellectual property"".  Could you answer the following question: ""copyrighting algorithms leads to fordidding knowledge of certain natural numbers.""  The question fulfills are your criteria. It is factual. It is unbiased. And the question is simple. However, I do not believe that this would fare well.  And there's also the whole psychological voodoo going on. You can basically influence the outcome of a vote just by phrasing and asking certain ""simple, factual and unbiased"" questions. The standard example I know of is using the words ""gay"" vs. the word ""homosexual"". It changes the outcome of questionnaires completely.

This can be compared with China town inhabitants in the US who don't speak a word of English.. because they just don't have to.  Also I feel like your second and your fourth point seem to contradict each other at least on the surface. Does migration has an impact on job numbers or not? When you say they're creating more jobs it would suggest it does.  All of this said, the huge advantage of drawing from a much larger pool of qualified workers is certainly not diminished with the negative consequences I've mentioned."

Well no - consider the Swiss big cities. Zürich, Berne, Geneve, St. Gallen etc. Their infrastructure has been planned out incredibly well. This is a question of good urban planning - not a political question, this is a technical problem that can be solved by smart people.   subcultures being created where immigrants don't have to integrate because they have already many people of the same nationality as neighbors.   Fair enough, but if you consider this   what of the Suisse Romande and Valais, they try and integrate, but have you seen a Genevois speak German in Zürich? I haven't. Likewise you wouldn't catch a Zürcher speaking French south-west. and second, are these people bad for society because they don't speak the language? Is language the only ""integrating"" factor?

This is a question of good urban planning - not a political question, this is a technical problem that can be solved by smart people.   Yes, it can be solved by smart people and it will, but it's just not true that the system is planned out well for increased capacity.  Case and point: Bahnhof Hardbrücke in Zürich. They had a this project ""Change"" to rebuild the station, but they didn't consider that in the future the amount of passengers using the station would double. Blunders like this keep happening, but they get solved eventually. It's not a very smooth ride though.. and having to replan projects like this costs a lot of money.  Also the housing situation in Zürich (and AFAIK Geneva) is horrendous. Affordable apartments are just not available. There is the risk of a housing bubble and measurable urban sprawl. This again causes increased traffic. This is mostly a political problem though.  I'm not saying these are reasons to limit immigration, but I don't agree that we're currently prepared for the amount of immigrants that come here every year.    what of the Suisse Romande and Valais, they try and integrate, but have you seen a Genevois speak German in Zürich? I haven't. Likewise you wouldn't catch a Zürcher speaking French south-west. and second, are these people bad for society because they don't speak the language? Is language the only ""integrating"" factor? What if they believe in the confederation - and all its values - however can't speak the language, would we consider them unintegrated?    Well, I have seen people from Geneva speaking German here in Zürich, but I guess that's anecdotal evidence on both sides. There are quite some differences between the Romandie and the German part and we notice that almost every time there is vote and the Romandie votes different than the rest of Switzerland. This has also caused tension. So it's not totally a non-issue.  Language was just an example. Of course there are more important factors, but language is an important one because most of integration happens through communication. We already have several language borders in this country and we already see the effect of subcultures forming as I mentioned above. Since all the Swiss share most values the language difference is not as problematic, but if we consider culturally different people a different language will definitely hinder integration.    IMHO places like Chinatown enhance most cities, they add vibrancy and life to them.    Chinatown sure. That was probably a bad example. One of the big advantages of immigration is that we can participate in their culture. I like diversity a lot even if it just comes down to the food choices when I go to a restaurant. However we don't always have such sub cultures that are as open towards the Swiss as Chinatowns are in the US.    Thus far though, every chinese, vietnamese, or asian immigrant I've met speak German, pretty damn well.    I'm not trying to hate on Asian immigrants at all :D. China town was just an example."
Switzerland,2ny6h1,oelsen,0,Tue Dec 2 10:52:48 2014 UTC,This is mostly a political problem though.   No it is not. Our immmigrants expect the American Dream and hate to be in a box somewhere in a city.  Look what the real motives are to move out of the urban areas with high a high quota of immigrants. Schools and their standards. Hypocrites.

There's a very valid expectation for immigrants to integrate.   Compared to how it was in Vancouver, I haven't seen any major problems (yet) with immigrants not integrating.

Consider other statistics, Swiss unemployment rate recently (2012,3,4) is LOWER than before it joined the Schengen (2004,5,6) Swiss migration has had NO adverse* impact on the number of jobs (compare OECD migration vs. Swiss Unemp.) Swiss immigrants pay more taxes than they consume welfare They've contributed to not just growing the economy - but providing more jobs overall, key word here. They're not just taking or doing jobs, but they're creating MORE.   None of that was necessarily the reason for voting against it. Some people were simply unhappy with their rural towns being urbanised as a result of the population influx.   And then there's Ticino. Look at what it did to their economy specifically. It could very well be a canary."
Switzerland,2ny6h1,enenra,11,Tue Dec 2 18:00:49 2014 UTC,"Honestly I don't think people immigrating are a big problem.

Switzerland,2ny6h1,enenra,1 point,Tue Dec 2 18:05:42 2014 UTC,Depends. I don't claim to know about the best way to achieve this but I'd probably start with mandatory (but free) classes in language etc. Getting to a point where you speak a language fluently takes a lot of time. It would probably make more sense to make sure there is progress over time.
Switzerland,2ny6h1,anonlymouse,1 point,Tue Dec 2 18:25:55 2014 UTC,"There's a difference between fluent and perfect though. It just means you can have a conversation continue fluidly (fluently, but I wanted to avoid defining fluent with fluent), rather than dry up/hit a wall rather quickly.   So someone might perpetually get der/die/das/den/dem/des mixed up, but they'd still know enough nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs to make themselves understood without too much difficulty and be able to understand what they hear without having to ask for it to be repeated too many times."

Sometimes actions needs to be taken, and sometimes it won't please everybody. I think the biggest problem of the initiative against mass immigration was not the initiative itself, but the way it was conducted.   We had three years to make the changes to the consitution, but the EU took actions immediately. I also think that it could have been better if there was some meeting about it prior to voting.  Either way, things happen. Atleast it's done and we'll see how it goes from there !  EDUIT: I also believe that when the foreign press writes about our initiatives/referenda (especially European ones), it has a much bigger impact. From what I understand, in a lot of European countries, they also have access to the referendum, but it is more of a last-resort type of thing.   That could explain why the immigration vote didn't please the EU people: Maybe they thought we went out of our way to reject the ability for EU members to cross the border, which we haven't."

Switzerland,2ny6h1,C4p5ul3,5,Mon Dec 1 22:14:15 2014 UTC,We have. There was an agreement that we would treat every EU member the same. At the time we were in talks with Croatia to extend the free movement to them as they had joined the European Union. However after we decided that we want to control immigration we were no longer able to continue those talks with Croatia and therefore were violating a core feature of the EU. The EU reacted by stopping the talks on the electricity market and our access to Horizon 2020 and Erasmus+. Then the Bundesrat made a deal with Croatia that made them happy enough and talks about these things resumed.   The EU has acted as expected and announced. They can't just give us special treatment because the people said so.
Switzerland,2ny6h1,SoulLink,1 point,Tue Dec 2 03:47:57 2014 UTC,"Oh yes, you are right. I forgot about the Croatia negociations. Didn't they get what they wanted in the end, though ?"

As for Erasums+ we have a ""Überganglösung"" which is continued until 2016.   The problem with both is, that we can't make a deal until we know whether we can maintain the Bilaterals I, which will only be decided once we adopt laws concerning MEI.  What happened with the electricity market I honestly can't say. Couldn't find any current information, but I believe that these talks will be suspended until we know about the Bilaterals I as well."

If I recall, I very narrowly decided to vote for it.  After seeing the EU's reaction, my mind was totally, unequivocally made up.    European countries don't have much of a tradition of direct democracy, so they don't understand how we vote.  Many would like to, but I think they just don't ""get"" it.  I think that part of the issue is also that they grasp the idea of popular voting for certain initiatives, and so have more of a tendency to hold the entire population responsible when we pass something they don't like.  Whereas in places like France, there's more of a sense of liking the idea of distant politicians, because it also gives you someone to blame when they take a decision you don't like."

I'm convinced that enforcing a too high standard of political correctness leads to a lot of frustration in the pouplation.

There seems to be this idea that citizens are generally too stupid to be trusted with something as important as politics, something a lot of the European press readily jumps on whenever we take a decision that may go against the prevailing political wisdom in other countries (e.g. the minaret initiative, the Masseneinwanderungsinitiative).  Which totally disregards the point that we manage to have a functioning democracy in the sense that we respect democratic, constitutionally valid decisions of the sovereign even if we're against it.  I'd like to add to your point that one thing I really dislike about our parliamentary system is the lack of personal accountability of elected politicians - the whole idea of ""list voting"" or party voting in my mind goes against this idea of individual voters being required to take responsibility for our political future.  There's not really much of a way to contact your elected representative, which IMO is one of the good aspects of political systems in countries like the US or UK that we should consider adopting too."

Their mistake is to believe that anyone else would be as eager to get into the same shit as their voters.  As for the voting system, I used to do mixed lists until I did the math and figured out that the way the election system is set up, this is a waste of my vote. These days, I vote for the party I most agree with and reserve my non-partisan votes for the four times a year we get to vote on concrete issues.  On a side note, I really don't share your experience that getting in touch with your elected representative is difficult. It's laughably simple on the municipal and Cantonal level, and still fairly easy on the Federal level. A lot of MPs even list their phone number online.   Considering most Cantons don't have single-member districts any more, it also pays to look around and contact an MP you think will be sympathetic to your issue, which won't necessarily be the one living closest to you."

But in a lot of ways, I think the average German voter is at least somewhat sensible and not given enough credit (France..ehhh...).  If you look at what the Germans have gone through economically in the past two decades, their governments have remained fairly reasonable.  The fringe Linke and NPD votes - sure, they get a small percentage, but the country's got a pretty well established center that I don't think it's so much in doubt.

It's laughably simple on the municipal and Cantonal level, and still fairly easy on the Federal level. A lot of MPs even list their phone number online.    I'm glad to read this - I had a very different experience a few years ago when I last had a (comparatively minor) issue that I felt strongly about.  After having a ton of trouble even finding contact information (some of the profiles on the admin.ch pages were incomplete) I wrote what I thought were very heartfelt, polite, well-sourced mails to several National- and Ständeräte (this was in Zug) asking them to vote against a motion condemning ""Killerspiele"".  I received two replies out of seven contacted, both in effect telling me to piss off, you have no idea what you're talking about.  I mean, these were really condescending and dismissive.    I had a similar experience with another (again, small) issue - wanting increased punishment for use of laser pointers.  I'm a hobby astronomer, so these are useful tools, and we already have laws to cover misuse.  Same thing.    I tend to only do this for ""fringe"" issues, because these are the ones that are usually only of interest to small groups - and are generally driven by someone with way too much time and passion on their hands, so they tend to not get enough debate.  But my encounter with the whole thing was pretty disappointing.  I agree with you that it's a waste of time the way it's set up and I tend to do the same as you, but that's a least-worst way of dealing with a poor situation.  We have a phenomenally high-quality electoral commission that is capable of putting out those informative, usually fair brochures about issues - they should be able to do the same thing for candidates' positions."

It is pretty clear that immigration is mostly dependent on economic growth and the availability of jobs here and abroad. Contingents will not actually reduce immigration, it only threatens our relations with the EU. It is a pretty bad idea independent from whom it came. SVP people answered, when asked who they don't want to come to Switzerland, families and students. Both of these groups make a small amount of the people that come, and students often do not even stay here beyond their studies.   From what I understand, in a lot of European countries, they also have access to the referendum, but it is more of a last-resort type of thing.

Good thing about the MEI is that it doesn't state any specifics about the quotas and how they are enforced, only that they have to be valid for all immigration.  Flexible quotas would allow to stabilize the immigration rate which is very much dependent on the health of the Swiss economy versus the health of the EU economies."
Switzerland,2ny6h1,oelsen,3,Mon Dec 1 21:44:12 2014 UTC,"The problem is that from 80000 people immigrating the vast majority are people who have work here and are therefore needed by someone for economical reasons. Other people that come here is family from people who work here, students who will leave once they finished studying and rich people who want to park their money here.  So I think in the end flexible quotas will not reduce the amount of people that will immigrate until we see a reduced economic growth. So the only thing MEI did was risking our relations with the EU.

Steg is one of the best places to buy Computer parts  (always check toppreise.ch any way, because some parts are cheaper in other stores)  Be careful over 62CHF you start to pay a lot of taxes trough mail    (like  12 chf + 10 + 8% of the merchandise price)... like for a 140 Euro (small package) I had to pay 50 chf of export duty, f insane!!!!  A lot of those company misleading costumers by putting ch on their address and most of the time they are from Europe = you will get screwed if you purchase over 62 chf.  Another solution is to use indabox.it  ( not too big packages) Praticamente fai spedire il pacco presso un loro centro ritiro (di solito un bar) e tu vai fisicamente a ritirare il pacco presso questo posto in italia. Paghi solo 3 euro per ritiro e non devi pagare le sovratassse della dogana. Stai solo attento a non superare i massimi legati alla dogana fisica che devi passare che, mi sembra, sono attorno ai 200 chf .  Ho usato questo servizio una decina di volta e funziona bene, non puoi farti spedire pacchi troppo grandi, ma é un servizio utile; specialmente perché eviti i prezzi assurdi dello sdoganamento via posta"

The glow around the writing and the Swiss emblem also doesn't go very well with the otherwise very clean look of the design, IMHO. I'd be happy to help out with creating artwork.  Overall: Very well done, I'm just not quite happy with the header. It also reduces the first impression to mountains, not sure if I like that.

Switzerland,2nvd48,Sertig,5,Sun Nov 30 20:25:41 2014 UTC,Generally speaking you don't need a permit to fly a drone in Switzerland. There are some things you have to consider though. This lawyer knows more (in German).
Switzerland,2nvd48,unicornsworshipme,4,Sun Nov 30 20:56:59 2014 UTC,"There are rules in place for special aircraft (Hanggliders, Parasails, Parachutes and unmanned aircraft). See [Verordnung des UVEK über Luftfahrzeuge besonderer]Kategorien(http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19940351/index.html). Therse are all covered by the same rules.  The essential rules are:   You don't need approval for commercial flights You need approval for unmanned aircraft >30kg (big drones) Model aircraft above 0.5 and below 30kg: ..* You need to keep line of sight ..* Restrictions in the vicinity of airports ..* New: Closer to 100m to crowds   This is the first time I look it up. looks quite reasonable to me. The New crowd limitation was introduced after there were a couple of drones flying over a demonstration in Zürich. The main concern is hurt people when drones fall on them. I like it that there are no limitations on small drones / model aircraft below 0.5kg."
Switzerland,2nvd48,markus_b,1 point,Sun Nov 30 22:43:33 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the information and the link following.  Now I seen that there is a requirement for liability insurance (Art. 20).

Switzerland,2nvd48,Urgullibl,1 point,Sun Nov 30 22:55:27 2014 UTC,"Liability insurance is insurance that can pay for the damage if your drone injures someone or damages someone else's property. The German expression is ""Haftpflichtversicherung""."
Switzerland,2nvd48,stabmeinthehat,1 point,Sun Nov 30 23:03:04 2014 UTC,its also relatively cheap and most apartment rentals require you to have it anyway (at least those I've seen in the Suisse Romande).  if you have home and contents insurance the same company will do lia ility as a cheap add-on to that.
Switzerland,2nvd48,markus_b,1 point,Mon Dec 1 06:46:19 2014 UTC,"Similar to a car. You need an insurance to cover the damage you can cause. Imagine your model airplane or drone flies into a person and the hospital bill is 100kFr. You may not be able to repay, so the law mandates the insurance to protect the victims from the financial consequences. The insurance will pay it on your behalf, like it will if you cause an accident with a car."

Yeah, an unfriendly version of polite :) I mean I guess you're right that it depends on the definition but the Swiss version of polite is not really the international version of polite. E.g. compare the Swiss to the people in Thailand. Say about Thailand what you want and we're better in a lot of things but they are like 10 time more friendly then we are.   Also part of the reason why we are so rich is simply because we're a pain in the ass. E.g. being very exact at work leads to a very good outcome but people calling the police because the wheel of a parked car with a foreign number plate is 3cm behind the line isn't."

We say hello and goodbye. We do everything by the book. Tell me how we could improve? Fake smile at everybody and meaningless small talk? No thank you, that is just fake politeness.

Switzerland,2nqxtu,janibus75,14,Sat Nov 29 14:22:31 2014 UTC,"I'm not trying to defend bad behavior. But let me illustrate the lack of bicycle lanes in Zurich and the big ""go fuck yourself"" I feel the planers thought when planing this city.  Driving on the side walk  Let's take this situation. The street is narrow as fuck, there is no way you can get past these cars without having to evade to the side walk or on the lane where trams are driving to the left.. and we know how dangerous the tram lane is.. even for cars. Also the side walk is super broad. Here a car even parks on it and people can still walk past.  There are numerous situations in Zurich where the side walk is so fucking broad the planers put the cycle lanes on it. Like in Gessnerallee. I mean seriously. What is this?  Then later after the crossing we see this, all the while cyclists have to drive on the narrow side walk. Cross a dangerous street where the countryside people from central Switzerland sometimes race on. I see these as ""go fuck yourself"" for cyclists all the time.  This here on the other side of the street is another classic. There is no space for cyclists at all. During rush hour you have to either evade to the left (tram lane) or right (side walk). See how narrow this is? Fuck this. A bit further down the fucking side walk is wider than the street. And you almost never see anybody walking there while the lane is so narrow that a cyclist can't pass. Of course we have to drive on the side walk.  Pedestrians not looking  Ever crossed this street without looking? Also not using the crosswalk at all? You wouldn't be the first: like every second pedestrian who crosses the Limmatquai I almost hit.  I gotta say, almost half the pedestrians already have one foot on the street until they look if something might be approaching to hit them. This is especially problematic because bicycles are quieter than cars and we're driving on the right side of the street.. usually just there where your foot is.  That said, when you look and it's clear you want to cross.. Yeah, to everybody who then doesn't let you cross: ""go fuck yourself"".  Driving on the cross walk  I hate that too. But honestly, most of it is due to the streets being really stupid lain out in Zurich. It's the same for cars only for them it's a bit less horrible to have to drive huge detours to get where they want to go. Like HB. There is no way to drive through here without having to cross here without having to drive huge dangerous detours (somebody died just meters from here) or to take the cross walk. Good thing they improved HB recently. It's not on Street View yet, but the bike lane is safer now.  If turning left would be easier I bet cyclists wouldn't use the cross walk as much. Zurich is not really bike friendly that way.  Other stuff  This is another favorite ""go fuck yourself"" moment. The bike lane just stops. You can see it down in the corner.  Same thing here. It's just like they say: ""Hey.. you're supposed to go up there, but how to do that safely... well, why don't you just go fuck yourself?""  So yeah man, I hear you when you say we don't follow the rules. I just see a ""go fuck yourself"" everywhere even when I'm trying to follow them."
Switzerland,2nqxtu,P1r4nha,12,Sat Nov 29 10:59:43 2014 UTC,"I'm a cyclist in Zurich, too. I bike for fun & sport (road bike), commute and go shopping with my city bike. I actually ride a lot of the streets you've showed.  But..   Let's take this situation. The street is narrow as fuck, there is no way you can get past these cars without having to evade to the side walk or on the lane where trams are driving to the left.. and we know how dangerous the tram lane is.. even for cars.   This is what I don't get, and why a lot of other cyclists drive me mad: You are the same traffic as cars are! Just like cars and scooters and trucks and trams. You're not entitled ""to get past these cars""! I don't like it either, but if there's a column of cars waiting without a bike lane being there you have three options:   If the cars leave a lane on the right side with enough space for you to pass through, you may overtake them. They are not required to do this, it's not mandatory. Wait in line! Stop, put your foot down and wait for your turn to advance. Get off the bike and walk.   We bikers have the same rights on the road as cars (except for driving on the Autobahn). But at the same time we have the same duties, too. Think about what would happen if a car hopped on the sidewalk for a bit (e.g. at Europaallee where it is wide enough).    That said, you've touched on a lot of points where I totally agree. Pedestrians at Limmatquai (my route for commuting) are horrible, most of them don't realize it's a street and not a pedestrians area.   This is another favorite ""go fuck yourself"" moment. The bike lane just stops. You can see it down in the corner.   I don't see a problem here. The bike lane is just merging into the regular road. They could have painted the lines a couple of meters further up to the other merge ahead, though. But you missed my absolute favorite fucking stopping bike lane (on my former commute):  This glorious example at Shilcity.  Not only is there fucking tree in the way, you're ending up right in the middle of the bus stop with a high sidewalk step so you can't just drive down into the street (which you only can do if there's not a bus parked there anyways). Every other meter of road around Sihlcity has terrific bike lanes, but these 10 meters of turning right into Manessestrasse have the worst.  Edit: mandatory -> not mandatory."
Switzerland,2nqxtu,chmod0755,2,Sat Nov 29 12:27:57 2014 UTC,"Most of the Street View images were not taken during rush hour so they might lose some of the ""woah, that's dangerous"" effect. Also I've not seen that many pedestrians on Universitätsstrasse ever. Must have been on a weekend.  You're right, parts of my rant talk about things that are not mandatory for the car drivers to do. The main point is that I think the room in the city is unfairly divided and if there is an obstacle it's usually on the bike lane. The cars still have to be able to pass and so do the pedestrians. And the cyclist.. well they have to find their way somehow around everything else. It's frustrating, but maybe I'm not always in the right when being frustrated.  Your example is indeed glorious. I'm rarely around Shilcity, but this is just one of the worst."
Switzerland,2nqxtu,P1r4nha,1 point,Sat Nov 29 13:21:49 2014 UTC,"I enjoyed your virtual tour of Zurich's bicycle lanes. I thought I'd share my favorite death traps in Basel. One of the busiest bridges in Basel, Johanniterbrucke, has an intersection which sorely could use stop signs or yield marks or something. I've seen so many accidents there. It's a complete free-for-all at all hours and no one lets the bikes through.  But the scariest place is definitely Aeschenplatz. This one definitely can only be appreciated from above. Most of the traffic lacks bike lanes. You share the lane with cars. There are seemingly 100 tram lines coming through the intersection at different angles and the pedestrians are running across the streets at completely random places to catch their tram. It's in a very central location, so if you bike through Basel a lot you go through that intersection pretty often."

Switzerland,2nqxtu,P1r4nha,4,Sat Nov 29 13:26:49 2014 UTC,"I agree with this 100% as a non-driver. I have been run into twice in Zurich and both times it has been somebody on a bicycle who thinks he doesn't have to stop at pedestrian crossings. Most cyclists just look at you clearly thinking ""fuck you, I don't want to stop"" and cut you off without braking - not to mention the arrogant little bastards who ring their bell behind you on the trottoir even if there's a bloody cycle lane right next to them.  Sometimes I want to kiss cyclists who follow the damn rules."
Switzerland,2nqxtu,futurespice,7,Sat Nov 29 15:49:57 2014 UTC,"No, we don't. We should be thankful we have common federal traffic laws that apply everywhere in switzerland and don't have to look up anormal traffic rules for ""our community"" as happens in the states. Red lights have a meaning and that meaning is stop. There's a light for ""continue at your own risk"", that's flashing orange. Or a green arrow beside a red light. Ever wonder why it's used so sparingly? Because we don't put intersections on low-traffic crosscountry roads like the americans do. Where there's a signal, there's a purpose for it."
Switzerland,2nqxtu,ALTSuzzxingcoh,-2,Sat Nov 29 16:40:30 2014 UTC,"Well, fact is that most traffic signs and rules are made for cars and not really bicycles. In many situations it makes perfectly sense to have a traffic light for a car, but very little sense for bicycles (e.g. when turning right on a cross-road).   But I agree that we shouldn't go for cantons to apply such laws, but that it should be a federal thing."
Switzerland,2nqxtu,P1r4nha,4,Sat Nov 29 21:19:47 2014 UTC,"You're both right here. There are some intersections where it's almost suicide to go without a green light, both for cars and cyclists. Then there are red lights that are only to control the use of a cross walk since otherwise crossing pedestrians might forever block the traffic because it's their right of way. It's always safe to cross there since you can just check quickly if there are pedestrians around.  So as a cyclist I don't think we can generally ignore red lights, only like half of them. If we could indicate safe(r) passage for cyclists somehow that'll be great.  For stop signs, no question. There are only stop signs at places where it's really hard to see... for motorists as they sit lower and further back than cyclists do.  /u/ALTSuzzxingcoh is totally right on American traffic laws too, what the hell!"
Switzerland,2nqxtu,086,1 point,Sat Nov 29 11:03:51 2014 UTC,"So as a cyclist I don't think we can generally ignore red lights, only like half of them. If we could indicate safe(r) passage for cyclists somehow that'll be great.   Wait, do I get that right. OP is suggesting an exception and the above sentence would call for an exception of that exception?  In general, I think some traffic laws of the US are worth considering (e.g. turn right on red, or right overtake on highway). Creating different means for the same signalisation according to your use of transportation is sure a new path for us. Considering that we can't even drive correctly in a roundabout or with trams, I personally believe it would not gain in a security benefit. But that's obviously not the point of OP's suggestion. The point is that cyclists can move quicker and more efficiently by having to stop fewer times. The benefit would probably be measurable for bicycle couriers in the city, but that's also the major cyclist group ignoring red lights, or traffic rules in general, on a regular basis (at least what I have seen in Zurich). The bottom line could be: gain of quicker bicycle travel for few, imposing new risks for many.  After all, what would help is that we all try to recall what it means being on a different vehicle. Since I regularly cycle myself, I am a different driver. I now realize more why the cyclist is in the middle of the road (for his safety in curvy downhill streets), that I overtake a cyclist only if I can fully drive on the left side and that I have to assume most drivers don't understand my situation while on the bike. So after all, instead of proposing a new regulation, I would propose to get drivers on the street on a bike and have them realize what it feels like being on the street."
Switzerland,2nqxtu,086,1 point,Sat Nov 29 11:31:19 2014 UTC,"Hmm... I disagree. As the proposed rule would be Red = Stop, Stop = Yield in all cases and the quoted sentence wanted to include exceptions. As the proposal is not active in our country, this would be an exception, as the quote would add an exception to this rule; it's an exception of the exception. ;-)"

Switzerland,2nnn6v,phpascal,19,Fri Nov 28 09:56:02 2014 UTC,"Nice title there!  However, complete bullshit... The border authorities stopped them and, despite the obvious reason for all the bikes, couldn't find any evidence that would have proved their guilt.  This is how our legal system works, and the only way it is correct! If you had to prove your innocence rather than the authorities needing to prove your  guilt, everything would be fucked up.  The 200CHF are a standard amount being paid to someone unjustifiedly having to spend a night in jail."

According to your response, you can steal everything in Switzerland. As long as you don't get caught while you steal it, you haven't any responsibility.  And this is by the way a main reason for people to hate foreigners and our legal system."
Switzerland,2nnn6v,telllos,5,Fri Nov 28 14:17:28 2014 UTC,"Then that's stupid, associating bike thief with foreigner is stupid."
Switzerland,2nnn6v,ichbingeil,0,Fri Nov 28 15:15:55 2014 UTC,But that's reality. Foreigners get a bad reputation because of individuals which exploit the law situation.
Switzerland,2nnn6v,Eskapismus,4,Fri Nov 28 15:28:40 2014 UTC,"Bullshit aswell, as they couldn't prove that the bikes were stolen; that's just the most probable way the bikes have gotten to them considering there was no information of their origin. That means they were just 2 guys crossing a border with 17 bikes that might have been stolen or might have been theirs legitimately. As long as that's all you can prove there's no way those guys should've been found guilty, especially not because the fact that they're not Swiss supposedly makes them more suspicious."
Switzerland,2nnn6v,Doemeltier,4,Fri Nov 28 16:40:11 2014 UTC,And this is by the way a main reason for people to hate foreigners and our legal system.   No they hate foreigners and our legal system because they are not very intelligent.   Protip: stop reading 20minuten

They couldn't in this case, as I assume no one has written proof of the serial numbers of their bikes... Just because some guy ""identifies"" his bikes on a photo, does not mean that they are actually his. I could also claim that the bikes are mine, but without proof, they really aren't in the legal perspective. (Eigentumsvermutung bei Fahrnisgütern)  And I really don't get your last sentence (""And this is by the way a main reason for people to hate foreigners"")... Do only foreigners steal? Do all foreigners steal? What does simple theft have to do with the nationality or the origin?"
Switzerland,2nnn6v,ichbingeil,-2,Fri Nov 28 14:23:35 2014 UTC,"That's another typical case of Romanian Diebesbanden, or criminal tourism. That was what I wanted to say with my last sentence. That hate doesn't come from nowhere.  Those people exploit our legal system and damage other people. This is inacceptable and should be punished.   The serial numbers can be removed very easily btw."
Switzerland,2nnn6v,ichbingeil,8,Fri Nov 28 14:34:38 2014 UTC,"Yes, the numbers can be removed, which is usually done to remove possible evidence. And thus not be able to prosecute legally. This is done all over the world with all different kinds of goods, but it does not change our legal principles.  Of course illegal acts need to be punished. However, punishments need a legal basis. Otherwise we could live in a dictatorship and have a similar legal structure. Would it be fair?"

Switzerland,2nmbec,anonlymouse,2,Fri Nov 28 20:03:00 2014 UTC,You are right in that I didn't take things like how easily something is carried along with you (preferably in a hidden fashion) with you. A chainsaw doesn't quite fit my pockets.  I guess a comparison to a corkscrew would have been more appropriate since those are pretty small and you can do about as much damage with a corkscrew. (talking about this type of corkscrew here)
Switzerland,2nmbec,fffmmm,3,Fri Nov 28 20:04:52 2014 UTC,"I'd say more damage with the corkscrew.   The thing with a kubaton is its only purpose is for fighting, so someone who is carrying it is planning on having a fight. If they get into an argument they're more likely to take it out and attack with it. Someone carrying a corkscrew is no more likely to attack someone than someone not carrying one, as the corkscrew is carried to open a wine bottle."
Switzerland,2nmbec,anonlymouse,2,Fri Nov 28 20:20:32 2014 UTC,"You could also use it as a keychain, but that's beside the point.  Maybe I am coming at this from the wrong angle, but my idea is that you require permits for weapons with which you can easily inflict massive damage or kill people or weapons that can cause massive damage and are easily hidden - like guns and certain types of knifes.  That's why certain types of pepper spray don't make it on to the list of weapons that require a permit (I don't buy the ""it's for defense"" line. Pepper spray can be used in an offensive fashion just as easily.) and it's why I don't think you should require a permit for a Kubotan.  Then again that's just my opinion and maybe I am coming at it from a completely different angle than the people who compiled the list of weapons that require a permit."
Switzerland,2nmbec,fffmmm,2,Fri Nov 28 20:46:31 2014 UTC,"You could also use it as a keychain, but that's beside the point.   You can also use a dagger to hammer in nails. The kubotan is explicitly a weapon disguised as a keychain. Nobody buys it thinking it's a keychain, they buy it as a weapon.  In the thread about knives, someone mentioned that they were asked to come down to the police station just so the police could make sure they weren't insane. It's about likelihood to attack someone, not about potential for damage. You can do a ton of damage with a car, but driving a car doesn't increase your likelihood to want to attack someone. Buying a kubaton does."

Switzerland,2nkfhs,SwissBliss,15,Thu Nov 27 09:57:30 2014 UTC,"It is not seen as a weapon since you can't open it with one hand and it has quite a short blade. So there is nothing by law that prevents you from carrying it. But for public events it depends on the organizer and they can indeed take it away from you or stop you from entering at all. As long as the blade is no longer than 13 cm (I believe), the knife doesn't have a locking blade and you can't open the knife with one hand, you're fine. It also depends in how good you can jide the knife. For example a sword that you carry on your side is not as illegal as a throwng-knife you can hide under your shirt.  From fedpol.admin.ch: Gefährliche Gegenstände im Sinne des Waffengesetzes eignen sich zur Bedrohung oder Verletzung von Menschen wie Werkzeuge, Haushalt- und Sportgeräte (wie Hammer, Axt, Baseballschläger etc.). Das Tragen und Mitführen solcher Gegenstände ist verboten, wenn nicht glaubhaft gemacht werden kann, dass dies durch die bestimmungsgemässe Verwendung oder Wartung der Gegenstände gerechtfertigt ist.   Missbräuchlich getragene gefährliche Gegenstände können von der zuständigen Behörde beschlagnahmt und eingezogen werden.   Keine gefährlichen Gegenstände sind Taschenmesser (wie etwa das Schweizer Armeetaschenmesser)."
Switzerland,2nkfhs,CH-Rampage,7,Thu Nov 27 10:52:54 2014 UTC,You're correct in most ways. But the current offical Swiss Army knife can be opened with one hand and has a locking blade. This is not the one sold at most tourist places though.

If I remember correctly, it was considered one in 2008 when it was introduced, though, but not for long - introduction of a few changes to the law (neues Waffenrecht) made it legal again."

Switzerland,2nkfhs,Motzlord,3,Thu Nov 27 18:21:30 2014 UTC,Pretty sure you could be walking on the street with a swiss army knife with the blade sticking out and nobody would care.  I believe a knife is not considered a weapon if it is within a certain length (I'd have to find the little booklet I have about weapon legislations to be sure).   It is however wise not to take such objects when attending an event where people are being searched at the entrance.

If this wasn't the law, you couldn't even go buy a kitchen knife.  Swiss army knives are perfectly fine, most Swiss people carry one anyway.   Just don't go about and around with double-edged blades such as daggers. Those are illegal. Swords and the like also have certain other limitations, as do baseball bats.

However, I do think that this is probably how our legal system works - the EJPD (Eidgenössisches Justiz- und Polizeidepartement) interprets the law here and makes certain things more specific because our law isn't clear enough about it. How exactly this works, I don't know. Maybe there is also a judge and/or a verdict behind that. I am not sure how exactly this works but I know as much: Just because it's not in the law doesn't mean that there hasn't been a previous decision by a judge somewhere.  Edit: I found this:   3 Der Bundesrat bestimmt, welche Gegenstände als wesentliche oder besonders konstruierte Bestandteile von Waffen oder Waffenzubehör von diesem Gesetz erfasst werden.   So that's probably it."
Switzerland,2nkfhs,Falr0s,3,Thu Nov 27 22:07:50 2014 UTC,"There is some correct information here, as well as a lot of misinformation / urban legends. The canton of vaud has made this rather detailed document to help with the situation : http://www.vd.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/themes/securite/police/fichiers_pdf/Vademecum_Armes.pdf  To clarify the acronyms used as column titles, PAA means ""Permis d'achat d'arme"", a license to buy a gun (only of some types), and PPA means ""Permis de port d'arme"", essentially if you need any special documents to have the right to carry it.  However, while the SAK is not a weapon by the official denomination, pay attention to the very last paragraph : you are forbidden from carrying ""dangerous objects"" in public spaces, if it doesn't seem reasonable that you do so, or if you can be thought of as potentially dangerous; essentially it's extremely subjective wether or not you can have a knife (or even a screwdriver really) on your person.  Your best bet is to not look threatening (dress normally, don't be drunk, and as sad as it is to say it, don't be black), and not act in a way that could cause you to be searched. Do note that most bars / nightclubs will have policies against knives, as (I imagine) do most schools / workplaces.

It's just not a popular opinion. They make it out as a struggle between the people and the ruling class. The reason this initiative has any support whatsoever is the anti-EU climate and the Swiss Franc being pegged to the Euro makes us dependent on the EU's economy.  However for them the vote has to be so obvious that any facts pointing against their preferred outcome is evidence for manipulation by the ruling class... Rothschild perhaps?"
Switzerland,2nk7gu,P1r4nha,3,Thu Nov 27 09:06:29 2014 UTC,"the Swiss Franc being pegged to the Euro makes us dependent on the EU's economy.   To a large degree, we are anyway - ~50% of imports/exports, all land/water traffic has to pass by them, most of our raw materials and component parts come from the EU, a huge percentage of our workforce as well...  My understanding was that the SNB's decision to support the Euro wasn't a peg, but a calculated move to not let it slip below 1.2 (?) by buying, which is great for exports.  Every time the Euro goes up above that rate, they stand to make a killing."
Switzerland,2nk7gu,P1r4nha,2,Thu Nov 27 09:51:42 2014 UTC,"Yeah, thanks about that. I discussed that a bit in the longer response I just posted.  We'd have to isolate us in many other ways from Europe first for it to make any sense to not keep buying Euros.  Explain to me why you wouldn't call it a peg though. I'm not an economist myself and everybody else seems to call it a peg. Does a peg work differently from creating money and buying the currency you want to be ""pegged"" against?"
Switzerland,2nk7gu,P1r4nha,3,Thu Nov 27 09:56:36 2014 UTC,"We'd have to isolate us in many other ways from Europe first for it to make any sense to not keep buying Euros.   Either that, or the Euro would have to dip below a given value.  Think of it this way - if the SNB's been buying a crapton of Euros at 1.2 (that's the rate, just looked it up) in exchange for gold that otherwise wouldn't be doing anything, and the Euro rises to, say, 1.3, they've just made a metric shitload of money.    They don't need more than a certain amount of Euros (as part of what are called foreign currency reserves - every healthy government should have some, for reasons like wanting a cushion against exchange rate fluctuations and economic downturn and being able to maintain balances of payment / debt servicing, etc.)  In terms of definition, it's related, but not entirely the same.  A peg sets a strict relationship between currency A and currency B.  The government usually will do this through the same mechanism the SNB uses (buying/selling on the open market).  A national bank can also just decree that ""the currency is worth XYZ of this other currency"", but that never works (black market arises fairly quickly).  Some pegs allow for a certain flexibility (plus/minus a few percent).  This is sort of a ""half peg"".  The SNB just doesn't want the CHF to rise above a certain value of EUR.  They don't care if it falls below."
Switzerland,2nk7gu,C4p5ul3,0,Thu Nov 27 10:03:25 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the comment.  Some people probably think its linked to Rothschild. However I think the actual frustration presented is legitimate. I think you demonstrate it well:   I feel insulted by the gold freaks   Nevermind the irony of this statement; the labelling of that which is non-mainstream by pejorative after pejorative feels all too clandestine, although perhaps that is just paranoia. Regardless; there is a legitimate school of thought that proposes a more stable currency through the use of Gold, and it is not conducive to dismiss it via appeals to novelty, which is a common logical fallacy I see pinned against it. I would like to see more respectful debate on the issue.  This is a Canadian speaking, so I offer my regional perspective. What do you think?"
Switzerland,2nk7gu,P1r4nha,8,Thu Nov 27 09:19:01 2014 UTC,"Well, I'm not part of the ""ruling class"", unless you'd call a citizen of a federal republic with direct democracy ""the ruling class"". What I demonstrate is that I feel insulted and that's why I insult them back.  This might not be very mature, I agree, but I find it useless to discuss with people that see any contradicting evidence to their opinion as the result of a conspiracy. There is no evidence that votes in Switzerland get rigged and we had more important votes in the past, in my opinion. Hell, we have votes every few months some go totally against the recommendations of the government. This is routine to us. Anything weird would immediately be noticed. The claim that this initiative either has to be voted for or the system is broken is fatuous. And that's why I called them freaks, not because I don't like their opinion.  But giving you the benefit of the doubt: I think it's totally valid to discuss the different economic systems and the role of gold as a backing mechanism. Pegging our currency to the Euro makes it dependent on the European Union. With gold (or anything else) we would be less dependent, but since more than half of our exports go to European countries we're still dependent on how much they pay us and unfortunately we export more than we import so a high valued currency is costly for us.  This and the fact that the gold could never be sold except for an official state of emergency (sorry, only in German), is the Swiss perspective on this issue. It's not about a more abstract discussion if money actually has any value if it's not backed by something like gold etc. I live here and I observe the campaigns. The discussions are rarely on the abstract level, but tailored to the current state of Switzerland's economy and its dependency on Europe.  Also: The Swiss Franc is popular as ever. We haven't really noticed anything unusual here in Switzerland since the pegging. Quite the contrary. The crisis of 2008 has barely touched us and everything is normal and fine and dandy as ever. This is exactly the job of the central bank by the way: To keep our prices stable. And it seems to me that they succeeded in that. We can discuss their methods and if they couldn't have done that better, but I find it quite remarkable that we didn't get that many problems while half of Europe and most of the US is hurting. So when you talk about a more stable currency... what do you mean?"

Switzerland,2n97d3,SoulLink,1 point,Tue Nov 25 15:53:14 2014 UTC,"Well this text is extremely bad in so many ways that it just hurts to read.  What is wrong you ask? Well here we go:   Despite being basically half-German, half-French, and half-whatever-the-hell Romansh is   Ignoring Italian and the fact that Romansh is a small minority.   somehow systematically managed to avoid every major armed conflict of the last two hundred or so years   Actually, literally 200 years. The last major conflict we were involved in were the Napoleonic Wars, which ended 1814 with the guarantee of our territory by the Coalition if we would remain neutral and function as a buffer state between Austria and France.  Then the next entire paragraph is simply wrong. The reasons why we were not involved in the wars mentioned were complicated and nuanced, our armed forces had little to do with it. That is just ""Geistige Landesverteidigung"" in a nutshell.   And the cold war is over. The number of men with military training and with their guns at home is decreasing fast.   badassitude    Seriously.   Swiss Pikemen were the single most badass infantry formation the world had ever seen   A bold claim. I'm pretty sure there were other types of infantry that were as famous as the Swiss formations. However it is true that Swiss mercenaries were widely used in the late middle ages. In this time the majority of armies were a majority mercenaries. Forced conscription was being phased out and standing armies came only later.   who got the opportunity to hire them.   Actually, everyone hired them. In many conflicts both armies had one or more Swiss brigades in them. For example in the Spanish War of Succession or the war between Milan and France.    The story starts in the 1300s, when Switzerland was part of the Holy Roman Empire    True.   Swiss Cantons (basically city-states)   Nope. That's an extreme simplification. Zurich was a ""Zunftstadt"", Berne was lead by patricians, Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden were ""Landsgemeinden"". Basel and St. Gallen were owned by Bishops. Parts of it were owned by the Habsburgs, Neuchatel was a Principality, Tessin, Schaffhausen, Vaud, Aarau, Solothurn, Jura were subjects of either one or several cantons. And it's a lot more complicated than that and changed a lot from 1300 - 1848.   fuck feudalism   Nope. It is first a silly statement as Feudalism entails political, economical and economic elements. You can't just get rid of it. The Ancien Régime was still a feudal society abolished by Napoleon by force.   having an Emperor sucks,   Exactly the opposite happened. The Swiss Cantons pledged direct allegiance to the Emperor to be independent from local feudal lords (Habsburgs and others).    we just wanna do our own thing and be left alone.    Nope. We were highly involved in European politics and wars. Until    There was no overarching president   Well of course, there were no presidents at all until the USA came into existence.    every man was a citizen-soldier who was trained in militia tactics   Some maybe. But hardly everyone. The relationships of people were very complex in middle age and late middle age societies. And things differed greatly between the Cantons. Berne was very expansionist, while Zurich was mostly interested in keeping what they had.   and even though they were still technically part of the Holy Roman Empire, Switzerland was pretty much its own thing.     The old Swiss confederation left the HRE in 1648 with the treaties of Westphalia. So they were very much part of it beforehand and not that special. Other regions of the HRE had similar privileges.   Then from here it gets worse.  Leopold III. of Austria wasn't the Emperor. At the time the Hohenzollern family lead the empire, which gave ""Reichsfreiheit"" to some Swiss cities and ""Landsgemeinden"" due to their strategic trade interest.   He simply wanted to increase his influence in the region. Which the Swiss surprisingly managed to prevent. So this part isn't entirely wrong. Which was part of the reason why the Swiss had a reputation.  Then the Burgundian wars were not just fought by the Swiss, but also by the French and the Austrians. Most battles in this war didn't involve Swiss soldiers at all, however the last battle at Nancy where he Charles the Bold died was mainly won by the Swiss and this was quite a shock to the European Powers as these peasants were able to defeat a noble. This helped tremendously in creating a Swiss position.   There are probably more mistakes, but he is right about the battles he describes. Just often not about the reasons they took place.   And the language. Just cringe-worthy."
Switzerland,2nc3wd,foxevv,6,Tue Nov 25 03:49:13 2014 UTC,"Right, so despite the massive increase in the volume of our currency over the last decade without any signs of inflation and more or less stable exports, this guy suggests reducing the amount of currency available substantially and tying it to a Bretton Woods style Gold standard. Why Gold? The reasoning being that for the off chance that the international financial system will collapse next year, we will have a solid but limited currency which will allow the international financial markets to park their money. If the international financial markets will not collapse in the near future, but later, we will shackle down our export industry with a hugely overpriced currency. We then will have a solid currency and no economy to work with it. Go bitcoin!"
Switzerland,2nc3wd,ruggar,0,Tue Nov 25 06:01:21 2014 UTC,"This is probably also downvoted heavily more, in comparison to upvotes. Not because it is irrelevant, but rather because the message contains an upopular opinion. People who downvote politically relevant opinion posts probably feel righteous in their downvoting: they believe they are doing good, because this opinion is ""bad"" in some way. However, it is my strong believe that no matter how much you disagree with an opinion, you still have to respect the opinion. I may not understand Swiss values 100%, and may not understand the concept of up- and down-votes. But downvoting a political opinion relevant to Switzerland because you disagree with it is definitively not the way to go."
Switzerland,2nc3wd,hikari-boulders,5,Tue Nov 25 09:28:44 2014 UTC,"You're probably right about the reason this gets downvoted, but it's not his opinion that is wrong, it's the facts that just don't pan out.  He makes it sound like the central bank steals our gold. They sold the gold, sure, maybe not for the best price, but we win when the central bank makes profit and it consistently made profits.  He believes that Keynesian economics is wrong. He's probably a proponent of the Austrian School of economics. That's what I dislike most about economics: There are too many ideologues. The whole debate around economic systems is like a religious debate between Christians and Muslims.. the truth is probably not found with either of them. I don't care what he believes or doesn't believe. Are his suspicions backed by facts?  He also obviously tries to make the current, stable situation sound bad. We already have one of the highest valued currencies. Despite the last few years Swiss Francs are still extremely popular and people park their assets in the Swiss Franc. Why do you think it's still so stable despite being increased that much? It's because everybody buys it to a high price. The trust in the Swiss economy is undeterred, so what is he talking about? So the record low unemployment will sink even more? We gonna profit financially? How? We're already filthy rich compared to everybody else around you.  I also like how he envies us for our ability to make a choice. Well, he could use his money to influence politics in the US, how about spending more time fixing the broken political system in his own country than making videos to influence the Swiss people to vote in his way. He's clearly going to profit from either his Swiss Francs that will sky rocket or his gold who will also gain in value, because he can sell it to the Swiss.  So it's not just an opinion, it's rather obvious that he's downplaying the massive problems we'll get with our export industries by calling it ""a couple of years of chaos"" (paraphrased) while trying to make the current status quo sound bad. He's got ulterior motives and that why he deserves a downvote."

Now, my recommendations in no particular order:  BE: Berner Platte has already been mentioned. Try to get Zungenwurst and sour turnips (""Sauerrüben"") with it. I don't care for sauerkraut, but I'd kill for sour turnips. The dried green beans are also pretty darn excellent, so insist on that.  There is plenty of good wine grown on the North Shore of Lake Bienne. Now is also the time when they cook saucisson in the alambic used to distill Marc (""Treberwurst/Saucisse au marc""). Highly recommended. Then head North towards Bellelay and get yourself some Tête de Moine.  Lake Thun produces some esoteric, but surprisingly good red wine if you can get your hands on a bottle. The whites are not terribly good IMO. As long as you're near the Highlands, it is mandatory that you try Hobelkäse.  VD: Sausage country. Saucisson vaudois, saucisse aux choux, boutefas and so on all need to be tested, preferrably accompanied by a Papet vaudois. In addition, Lakes Geneva and Neuchâtel produce plenty of fish to try. Perch fritters with Tatare sauce are always nice. L'Etivaz and Vacherin Mont d'Or cheeses are highly recommended, too.  As for wine, plenty of whites to choose from -- Lavaux if you like them dry and flinty, La Côte if you like them to be a bit more mellow, and Bonvillars if you want to go where nobody else goes. Not to forget Boxer beer in Yverdon.  GE: A nice Longeole suggests itself, as does Cardon Epineux. Entrecôte Café de Paris is another classic. Plenty of wine grown around the Canton, too.  VS: Raclette, tons of different dried little sausages from the German-speaking (?) part (Gommerli, Randenwurst etc.), dried meat. Plenty of wine to go around here, with quite a few excellent local varietals you won't find anywhere else in the world (Petite Arvine, Humagne Rouge, Cornalin, Lafnetscha just to name a few).  NE: Saucisson neuchâtelois, dry white wines and probably the best sparkling wines in Switzerland. Absinthe is legal again, too.  GL: Glarner Pastete is a hidden gem.  JU: Saucisse d'Ajoie, Damassine, microbrews from brasserie des Franches-Montagnes.  GR: Nusstorte, Pizzoccheri, Maluns, Capuns, barley soup. Molino di Poschiavo makes great old-fashioned pasta. Some very good red wines, too.  FR: La Bénichon is mostly over at this point, so you missed that one. Still, Moutarde de Bénichon should still be available.

Switzerland,2n0xqx,Pronato,5,Thu Nov 27 18:52:27 2014 UTC,"Why are you bothered so much with imaginary numbers? I've seen you commenting on ""printing money"" in a few threats now and I'm not really sure you understand what it means, as you seem to describe it as adding zeros somewhere on the asset side of their balance sheets.  Sure, we can discuss about imaginary numbers and future prices of gold etc. But ultimately that doesn't affect many people directly. What is much more interesting to look at is how the everyday Swiss citizen will be affected and that is directly tied to his or her ability to keep their job. ""You gonna lose your job."" is not a cheap cop-out, but the end result of a complicated discussion about economics. The end result for non-economists. I gotta agree, that I usually don't like the threats of economists either, but with the gold initiative it's pretty obvious that it's not an empty threat.  Money is basically just negative debt or the promise that debt is payed back after a certain time frame. Money supply is controlled by interest rates that incentivize how much credit/debt everybody gets. That's how money is created: By causing more people to owe you more by increasing interest rates. That's also by the way why in early day banking interest rates were heavily disputed. Sharia Law forbids interest rates and also the Vatican back in the day forbade it.  Anyway, what the gold initiative will do is bind the SNBs hands, which you clearly seem to be for, even though it only has to do with imaginary numbers that don't directly effect you. It will also create a guaranteed buyer of gold on the market, which basically makes the SNB the victim of speculators. Also I question if the gold price is really as stable as everybody says it is.    Also the value of our money comes down to trust. Trust that we can pay our bills. However we're NOT allowed to sell any gold. How the hell are people going to trust a currency that is backed by gold that cannot be touched. Is it really backed by   gold if the gold can't be used?  Some people say the franc will gain so much value that it going to destroy our export industries and basically put people on the street. Obviously certain proponents of this initiative hope that it will mostly be foreigners that lose their job and that it will slow down immigration rates. This makes sense, because whenever our economy was booming compared to our neighbors we had an increase in immigrants. And this was basically the main point I was hinting at when I said anti-growth people could be for this initiative: It probably crashes our export industries, put people on the street and immigrants will leave.  You know who will leave as well? Well educated Swiss people who are not bound locally to their jobs in Switzerland. This will cause a brain drain and damage Switzerland's most important asset: Know how.  Sure, if the Franc does not gain that much in value, it will only limit the possibilities of the SNB. It will lose control over its own businesses and foreign gold speculators will gain that control. It will make us even more dependent on foreign interests."

How the hell are people going to trust a currency that is backed by gold that cannot be touched. Is it really backed by gold if the gold can't be used?   Maybe have some more than 20% gold?  IMO the problem is that the SNB just sold huge amount of gold between  2000 and 2004. From the article:   The SNB officially went on to sell 1,300 tonnes of Swiss gold between 2000 and 2004 as a part of the gold price supression program.   This is what makes me upset and want to vote yes. They shouldn't be allowed to just sell the gold as they want and also they did it when the prices were low.

Switzerland,2n0xqx,Pronato,1 point,Sat Nov 22 07:49:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah, they could have made more money when they've waited. In hindsight you're always more clever. Nevertheless the SNB has made quite a lot of profit in the past few years. They're definitely not losing any money.  The initiative comes down to one question: What do you want on your assets to be backed with? If you don't trust the value of the Euro, the current policies are risky. Shifting the weight over to something more stable would be great, the question is if gold is more stable or not. However that ignores the ramifications of what happens to our export industries when we're no longer pegged to the Euro.  If we don't have to buy gold, we have to sell Euros. If the EU is going to recover and thrive in a couple of years everybody will hate on the SNB because they sold Euros when the price was low, if the EU is going to crash again and more and maybe even split up (and more chaos that we cannot predict) we'll be going down with them with the current policy. I'm not sure gold would help us then anyway. The initiative is again written with an isolationist's mind. To become more independent from the EU and its economy, we would first have to find other trade partners. Then we wouldn't care us much about the value of the Euro. Then we wouldn't need pegging and also nobody would care about gold.  One last point about selling gold: I'm okay with it. Their task is to give us price stability and when trading with gold achieves that, so what? I don't like that we have to tell them that a fifth of their backing has to be gold. Sure, buying even more gold is a possibility, but I don't think you should put that many of your eggs into one basket."

Switzerland,2n0xqx,rockenrohl,1 point,Tue Nov 25 09:34:48 2014 UTC,"Short history lesson about the tragic war against the Swiss gold reserves:   Tragic Turn of the Gold War  In the nineties, the gold war entered what may be its last and most tragic phase. Gold-rich Switzerland became the main target. War preparations are often made a long time before actual hostilities begin. The groundwork was laid many years ago when it was suggested that neutral Switzerland join more international organizations. The battle for Swizerland’s gold opened when the country became a member of the IMF in 1992. A few years later, in 1996, the SNB radically changed its gold policy.  Late in 1996, the Swiss government, in co-operation with the SNB, came to the surprising conclusion that, in today’s world, a 40% reserve backing of its currency was no longer necessary.  For decades the SNB had been considered as solid as the rock of Gibraltar. Not that its record was impeccable, to the contrary, it blundered repeatedly. But, it had in its coffers 2,590 tonnes of gold representing the golden guarantee. It was the fourth largest gold reserve in the world, equivalent to 8% of total official gold, or almost as large as the reserve of Germany, a country 10 times larger than Switzerland. The Swiss National Bank decides to give up its independence because of its own blunders  Things were going to change. In the early 1990s, the Swiss economy was not doing well, and unemployment was uncharacteristically high. The SNB knew that the most expeditious tool to weaken the franc was to drop the golden link, i.e., to reduce monetary discipline. The golden link had to be eliminated anyway because Switzerland had surrendered to the rules of the IMF by becoming a member. Chronology of the swiss monetary drama  1992  Switzerland joins the Bretton Woods Institutions  ”All Warfare is based on deception” – Sun Tzu (China, 500 BC)  ”The Swiss National Bank has no intention of selling any gold” – SNB Board member, June 20, 1992  The end of the Swiss Franc’s historic tie to gold was brought about in 1992, and not in 1996 or 1999. The decision was taken when Switzerland joined the IMF. According to IMF articles of agreement adherence to a gold-backed currency was prohibited, and Switzerland fell to its knees under the leadership of its Federal Councilors EU-favorer Flavio Cotti and the social democrat Otto Stich. The only ones who did not know what was going on were the Swiss people. They were never told the truth.  In recent years the government and its growing bereaucracy built up a powerful PR machine for the purpose of direct intervention. It is now the order of the day that before each plebiscite this opinion-making propaganda machine is deployed, and heavy pressure is put on citizens to follow government proposals. The whole exercise it not only illegal, but it is done at taxpayers cost. This is no longer a democracy.  How could the Swiss be lured into giving up their gold standard? The easiest way was to let them join the IMF, although it pretends to be in favor of strong currencies, explicitly states in its articles of agreement that member are prohibited from tying their currencies to gold. They can tie their currencies to anything else, to Special Draing Rights etc, but not to gold. This is how tha Swiss franc lost its unique status. And that is why Swiss banking will gradually lose its powerful position.  It was a sensational triumph for the manipulators. They had finally achieved what they wanted for so long: the complete abolishment of gold’s monetary role. From there it was only a short step to convince Switzerland to sell its gold, thereby pushing the price of gold further down into the abyss. The Switch was thrown and the manipulators only needed to wait. The gold wars were entering their most decisive phase"

But clearly it is just a copy-paste and not necessarily /u/lazaard's opinion (read the first sentence). Also the wording from this copy-paste history are a little... conspiratorily exagerated? Nevertheless, every theory needs to be tested. I only googled 30 seconds and found that Switzerland is part of IMF and that IMF is not in favour of a strong gold standard. Now the only unsettling sentence to me was the following:   explicitly states in its articles of agreement that member are prohibited from tying their currencies to gold.   This may need further checking and define in greater detail what is meant by that. This is, in my opinion, the most important part of this comment."
Switzerland,2n0xqx,hikari-boulders,1 point,Tue Nov 25 23:29:47 2014 UTC,"Text is from Ferdinand Lips book Gold Wars. Here more:   The Enemy from Inside  The financial press of March 18, 1997, announced how a study group of the Swiss Department of Finance and the SNB had worked out proposals for a more profitable management of the Bank’s currency reserves, in other words, they had graduated to the modern central bank portfolio theory. In it’s 90th Annual Report closing December 31, 1997, the SNB gives an absolutely unsatisfactory explanation for lowering the gold reserve requirement. It said that the reduction to 25% was necessary because otherwise the gold lending activities would have compromised the SNB by violating the legal limits. Such a justification is hard to believe, but what is even harder to believe is that the SNB should resort to such a bogus explanation.  For me, a Swiss citizen whose family is Swiss on both parents side for as long as there are written records, this was betrayal. It was completely against Swiss traditional thinking and behavior. We Swiss have always been slow to adopt new foreign procedures, and, in particular, revolutions of such a fundamental nature. Of cource, there was the constant lameting and influencing by a destructive media. There is no doubt in my mind, however, that the main instigators for the change of mind came from overseas. Some foreign master planners with great experience and full of brilliant tactics must have suggested this course of action to Swiss central bankers, making this caper the envy of Clausewits or Sun-Tzu had they been alive. For the foreign manipulators, the last gold-backed currency, the Swiss Franc, was the only remaining obstacle to be removed from the path to the fairyland of a global fiat currency. Who needs a small country in the middle of the Alps to have the impertinence to own all that gold and to have the best currency? The treasure in the mountains had to be taken by an unususal maneuver.  When reading the following paragraphs, one should keep in mind that the main arena in which these events took place remained to be the war against gold. There is nothing else that worries the would-be masters of the world more than the power of gold. Throughout history there were many ambitious politicians who wanted to become the master of the universe. Today this dream still prevails in some arrogant minds. In order to create a world with one government, on central bank and one currency, the biggest and most important obstacle in the path of attaining that goal must be destroyed, and that is gold.  However, and as said before, the war against Switzerland, or the battle for the Swiss gold, was already won 1992, when the country joined the IMF. That was the decisive moment when the usually prudent and historically solid Swiss did not pay attention. What was to follow could be achieved relatively easily by the powerbrokers."
Switzerland,2n0xqx,P1r4nha,1 point,Mon Nov 24 11:20:45 2014 UTC,"Thank you for your post and the time to write everything up. You're right, I have been commenting on the money inventing recently. I will try to reply and explain a little what I mean.  My biggest concern is that I don't seem to grasp some explanations given to me which are meant to be serious (I try to ignore the crackpots). I don't seem to grasp stuff and that bothers me.   commenting on ""printing money"" in a few threats now and I'm not really sure you understand what it means, as you seem to describe it as adding zeros somewhere on the asset side of their balance sheets.   Just a technicality, but I've started making a distinction between ""printing money"" and ""inventing money"". I've heard that printed money has to be backed up with 40% gold in Switzerland, and balance sheet magic money currently has to be backed by nothing (for all intents and purposes), that's why the distinction is necessary. Please could you tell me that it is not ""just adding zeros"" and elaborate on what it is? I'm very much concerned with exactly this point, because the Billanz of the SNB has increased to a factor 5 and I don't know how this will affect us in the future. Do we need to scale this down again? In what timeframe?   ""You gonna lose your job."" is not a cheap cop-out, but the end result of a complicated discussion about economics. The end result for non-economists.  I gotta agree, that I usually don't like the threats of economists either, but with the gold initiative it's pretty obvious that it's not an empty threat.   This is a fairly standard argument I hear very often. You say that ""with the gold initiative it's pretty obvious that it's not an empty threat"". Could you also make it obvious for me (a non-economist)? Why is it obvious to you? For me the only thing I understand about the job-losing is the thing which concerns recession. This is agreed to be currently very much dependent on buying shitloads of Euros, and I accept that. But the gold initiative is almost independent of the Euro pegging, is it not? The only dependence between Gold Initiative and Euro pegging is that we cannot buy umlimited supply of Euros but need to have 20 Euro gold for every 100 Euro we buy. This immediately brings me back to my question: Do we just invent the money (the money we use to buy Euros)?   Money is basically just negative debt or the promise that debt is payed back after a certain time frame. Money supply is controlled by interest rates that incentivize how much credit/debt everybody gets.  That's how money is created: By causing more people to owe you more by increasing interest rates.   That seems to answer my question about ""inventing money"", but I don't understand it.   negative debt or the promise that debt is payed back   debt from who? to who? payed back by what?   after a certain time frame   Have you heard any word in the discussions about Gold Initiative or Euro pegging about the time frame the Euros will be payed back? I heard the SNB guy saying that will do ""unlimitedly [unbeschränkt]"" whatever it takes to buy them Euros. I don't like it if this ""unbeschränkt"" refers to a perpetual time frame.   That's also by the way why in early day banking interest rates were heavily disputed.   Inflation and non-gold backed money has also heavily been disputed. I like disputes, it gives me something to think about.   Anyway, what the gold initiative will do is bind the SNBs hands   I fail to see why this is a bad thing. First of all the SNBs hands are bound by the current constitution. Secondly, the GI will bind its hands in the sense that for every 100 Euro we buy we will have to have 20 Euro of gold. (I am deliberately not saying ""will have to buy 20 Euro worth of gold"", because this is not what the GI says but rather a consequence of it.) This is heavily dependent on the question whether the SNB is allowed to invent money or not.   which you clearly seem to be for   If the SNB is allowed to say ""we will now invent one trillion trillion trillion CHF to pay everybody everything"" then I am clearly for a binding of their hands. (Note that I said ""if"").   even though it only has to do with imaginary numbers that don't directly effect you   I like the term ""invented magic numbers"". Not because ""imaginary numbers"" has mathematical meaning, but because of the following: We invent the numbers, but we imagine that everything is okay and we have that money to buy stuff. If I may ask an extreme question: why doesn't the SNB invent new money and we all imagine that our national debt is gone? Please note that I have never said that the invented money will not affect me. It will affect me, of course, because the monetary policy and economy of the country affects my life in the country. I don't care much about astrology, either. But when the long-term future of a country starts depending of Saturn being in the house of the lion when the moon is full during the rising of the scorpion, then I start questioning this stuff and think about how we wan't to foolproof this system. I'm not saying that economy is like astrology, but economy is no hard science either.   It will also create a guaranteed buyer of gold on the market, which basically makes the SNB the victim of speculators.   I hear this argument a lot. I could elaborate more on this, but let's stick to the following question: Why isn't this reasoning not valid with the pegging of CHf to the Euro? Note that the pegging is ""binding the SNBs hands"". Are there no Euro speculators?   Also I question if the gold price is really as stable as everybody says it is   I don't care what ""everybody"" says. I like to stick to facts. Fact is: Gold has never gone down to zero. Fact is: Money has gone down to zero.   Also the value of our money comes down to trust. Trust that we can pay our bills. [...]  How the hell are people going to trust a currency that is backed by gold that cannot be touched.   How are people going to believe that somebody is well off during a crisis if he has a mortgage free land with a house, but cannot sell it because he lives in the house?   Is it really backed by gold if the gold can't be used?   I can't be sold during normal times. It needs Notrecht to sell it. I can be used, e.g. to increase our trust, or to print new money which says ""I promise we can cover this""."
Switzerland,2n0xqx,lazaard,2,Tue Nov 25 10:45:45 2014 UTC,"Damn, I lost parts of the text I was meaning to write :(  Anyway, I'm not an economist either so I won't be able to use many expressions they use and my understanding is very reductionist and not very fancy. However I think I understand how the money supply works.  On inventing money  Turns out you're half right and I'm half wrong about this. It's possible for the central bank to just create money by adding numbers. However they don't often do this and it's not how the money supply is usually increased. What controls the money supply is the interest rate with which banks borrow money from the central bank.  They'll give you credit and want interest on that, so you have to pay them back more than you got. Also they have to pay back the central bank more than they got. That sounds troubling, but that's how you suddenly end up having more money in the system. If you look at money as negative debt that works. If you look at money as a finite physical commodity it doesn't.  Economists argue that this is fine, because by using the money you and all others borrow from the banks they create value and a thriving economy which leads to a more trusted currency. It also seems to invites inevitable inflation. That's not usually a problem though, because the money is a reflection of the value in the country and as long as value is created an increasing money supply just reflects that.  On the vote causing a recession  It's obvious to me because most economist say that the unofficial peg to the Euro will no longer be possible if we have to buy the corresponding value in gold. If the Franc skyrockets versus the Euro our export economy will be destroyed and that's quite a big chunk of what makes us so rich. I have to be honest though: I'm not totally convinced that we would have to stop buying Euros. If the price of gold goes up we wouldn't need to buy additional gold to back the Franc and could continue buying Euros. You already realized that however when saying that we ""have to buy 20 Euros gold"". But of course that would increase the balance sheet even more. And yes.. by inventing money.  On the worth of money being dependent on trust  If we look at money as negative debt as I explained above we have to look at what is debt in this case. Banks borrow money from the central bank, businesses or other private persons borrow money from banks. You get credit and are indebted with a certain interest. The money is basically a guarantee by the central bank that you will get your worth of that money. Most of the time they don't have to come clean on this promise however. People just believe it. They believe that the money has a certain worth and that's enough to validate it as a commodity to trade with. Physical money is either coins or paper. It could also be something else. It doesn't matter if you have cash in your hands or a number on your bank account. Both are worthless if the trust in the central bank disappears.    This leads me to the problem of bubbles like the housing market bubbles in 2008 in the US. Banks (or rather those GSE) gave people credit to buy houses they couldn't afford. They created money by giving credit (giving credit is creating debt for somebody else and negative debt is money) which they would not get back, because the people who got indebted could not pay it back. And this is where the system becomes dangerous. Suddenly money exists that people are not so sure actually reflects anything of worth. The promise the banks make that this money and the value exists is dubious. They were able to make these promises because for some fucked up reason you can package mortgages into weird packages and bet against their worth. This is also where my knowledge of financing is reaching an end. For some reason the banks didn't care if that money could be paid back, because they would make more money by trading with the mortgages rather than the money actually being paid back.  So as soon as the trust disappears that some debt can be payed back by the person or institution who borrowed that money, you'll run into a problem with the worth of that money.  What it means for our situation is that the SNB trusts the Euro, otherwise they wouldn't buy it at a certain price. Is it dangerous when we have unconditional trust in the EU? I'd say yes, but you would probably have to look at the context the ""SNB guy"" said that. I'm sure there are exceptions, but none that are considered a possibility. They trust in the recovery of the Euro and that will make us a killing.  We certainly can sell the Euros again and if the value of the Euro is higher we'll be making a killing.  On gold and its role as backing  The argument is that gold will never be totally worthless. On the global market that's probably true. On an individual basis probably less so. You and I only like gold because we know what else we can get with it when we give it to somebody else. So it's the same as money... or any other commodity. Good about gold is, that it cannot go bad like food does over time. It's quite independent on many factors like weather and it cannot get damaged easily. That's quite a cool thing. Magic numbers (or whatever you want to call them) are almost the same. Our physical money also, except that paper bills can be burnt. The biggest difference is that the value of gold is also independent more or less on governments and their policies. When a region becomes independent, a government starts a war, countries get occupied i.e. any kind of governmental instability the worth of money is in danger, the worth of gold much less so. And I think that's what proponents of gold are motivated by. Their trust into governments is unusually low and many of them believe a crash is imminent either of the global economy or the governments on the global stage. Many of them are Libertarians who don't believe a government is even necessary anyway. No wonder a currency that is based on trust into government policies and the health of the economy cannot be trusted.  That is also why the Swiss Franc is so popular and consistently highly valued: Everybody trusts in our stability. The Swiss economy is a great place to make business. We're more free and less socialist than other countries and we grant a bit more freedoms. We don't care what the others are doing.. until recently. The international pressure to do business similarly like everybody else has increased. We can argue if that's fair. Is it fair that we basically helped everybody else in the world to evade their taxes? Obviously the governments who suspect us to have their citizen's money want us to change our policies. That's another reason why Libertarians like Switzerland: They don't believe in government so they don't want to pay taxes for it. Being able to evade taxes is even more awesome than for the average person, because it fits their world view.  Backing the Swiss Franc isn't generally a bad thing, but the price of gold also fluctuates. Also by having our gold around the world we can profit from its location relative to the trading partners. The initiative says that we need to store all our gold in Switzerland. It's another indication that they believe we cannot trust other governments and have to take care of ourselves.  I have to agree with you that my argumentation that binding the SNB's hands is a bad thing doesn't have to be generally true. It was a stupid thing to say and I was trying to make use of a liberal argument against government intervention. It's interesting that usually the liberal argumentation is that government shouldn't limit the free market, but it's okay now to limit the SNB in deciding how the currency should be backed.   The rest of your questions   Are there no Euro speculators?   Yes there are. Switzerland is one of the bigger ones, wouldn't you agree? It's a risky course to trust only one thing. Our assets are backed by all kind of things, including gold. The question is if we should limit the freedom of the central bank to decide on what is currently the best thing to be backed. If gold isn't a good idea we should be able to sell it. Same with Euros. I find it dangerous that we have to hold on to our gold until we're in a state of emergency. That goes against the task of the central bank to keep prices level.   How are people going to believe that somebody is well off during a crisis if he has a mortgage free land with a house, but cannot sell it because he lives in the house?   I'm not sure I understand this question. He can always decide and move out of the house? He doesn't have to wait for a state of emergency. It's enough to understand the current trend of his wealth.  In conclusion  I don't think gold in general is a bad thing to have as backing, but I don't think our current situation requires isolationist and conservative policies. Gold is also not magically awesome as other backings. It has its disadvantages as well. It's a solid investment either way, there are many worse things. I think I understand the motivations of the proponents, but I don't share them and that's why I'm against government intervention in this case. Mainly because of the question if buying Euros will still be possible which nobody was able to answer me convincingly. The possibility that it's not going to be possible and might cause a recession, one that the SNB was great at avoiding, is reason enough for me to be against the measure.  Phew.. I hope I answered all and everything."

The rest, 97% is created by the private banks. Sure SNB creates a small fraction of the total money supply, private banks creates the majority and do so without any restrictions.  So, who cares if the SNB backs 3% of the money supply with 20% gold? It will not matter much to the Swiss people."

Note that the pegging is ""binding the SNBs hands"". Are there no Euro speculators?   Great point, but a big difference is that the market for Euros is so large compared to the physical gold market, buying euros will therefore not affect price as much as in the case of gold.   SNB could be a big winner btw, if Swiss people vote yes. If other central banks start buying after SNBs large purchases are finished (20% peg to the monetary base), the price may remain high. But I feel this will not happen for many reasons. Most central banks do not care about gold and I don't see any sign of this changeing in the coming years. So who will keep the price high after SNBs peg is reached? Who will take their place?"
Switzerland,2n0xqx,hikari-boulders,0,Sat Nov 22 16:40:53 2014 UTC,"Switzerland should get rid of the SNB altogether. Either they go, or Switzerland crashes, after that they will have to join the EU and start using the euro which will be dictated by an even larger central bank called ECB."

The customs question was discussed in another comment, despite you would have to check with the Swiss customs as well. I see two options for you:  1) If you do not get lots of coins back, look for a business traveler that regularly flys over to UK. You take the Swiss coins and pay the pound to your customers and you ""sell"" the Swiss coins to the traveler.  2) If you have a larger volume of coins, for example when your business goes through the roof, check with a transport company for valuable goods (e.g VIAMAT ).

Switzerland,2mrhps,Nelav,0,Fri Nov 21 16:54:33 2014 UTC,"Why don't we just cross out ""Männer"" and throw out criminals in general? Most criminals don't get the sentence they deserve (IMHO), anyway. Most don't manage to stay away from crime anyway, after being convicted.  (I know this is a joke, but honestly, it pisses me off how criminals are treated here. Victims of Violence for example often suffer physical and emotional pain for a long time and the people who did it go to prison for a couple months... wtf..?)  For me it isn't about race anyway."
Switzerland,2mrhps,chrisnch,3,Wed Nov 19 15:13:02 2014 UTC,"Jail time should be a combination of punishment and making them fit into society again. The longer/harder the punishing phase, the harder the reintegration becomes. It should not be about revenge for the victim. Because that revenge would trigger the family of the initial revenged to start their own revenge again, and then you end up with the middle East. I think modern west-european societues have a pretty good result with low crime, not a lot of people in prison, and non-ridiculous expenses. Of course, news papers and some political parties thrive on showing all ""small"" crime under a magnifying glass (and not researching any white collar crime), so the newspapers pretend it's all very horrible."
Switzerland,2mrhps,DeepDuh,3,Wed Nov 19 22:15:12 2014 UTC,There are a few counterexamples with even harsher laws than the US and low crime rates though: Japan and Saudi Arabia for example. It shows that it's probably more of a cultural issue and the criminal enforcement can only steer so much in one or the other direction. There's also some interesting link of violence in many countries with the amount of lead in the atmosphere about 20 years prior - it correlates remarkably well. So there seem to be biological factors at play as well.
Switzerland,2mrhps,chrisnch,1 point,Wed Nov 19 23:08:45 2014 UTC,"Saudi Arabia have their religious-police who hand out beatings and worse? I wouldn't consider that anything close to enviable.  I didn't know about lead, I'm glad we took that out of car-fuel."

Switzerland,2mrhps,kitsune,1 point,Fri Nov 21 16:17:04 2014 UTC,"There are countless of studies about this, from a variety of countries, and the sentiment that 'sentencing is too lenient' turns out to be outright bullshit. Members of the public who think that judges are 'too lenient' turn out to be as lenient or even more lenient than the judges once they have the same information about a case.  For instance:  http://publicaddress.net/hardnews/perception-and-reality-in-the-criminal-justice/   It found that when jurors drawn from 138 criminal trials were asked questions about crime prevalence and sentencing in the abstract, their responses mirrored those of general population surveys, in which 70-80% of respondents say that sentences are too lenient.  But when they were in full possession of the facts, 90% of the jurors said the sentence imposed by a judge was either ""fairly or ""very"" appropriate. And more than half suggested a more lenient sentence than judges actually imposed.   or http://www.uk.sagepub.com/cavadino/sentencing_trends_in_britain.pdf   Research on public opinion over the past three decades has consistently established that the British public is critical of sentencers, and that this criticism exists independent of crime trends and even dramatic changes in criminal justice policies. In the 1996 British Crime Survey, respondents gave significantly more negative evaluations to judges than to any other group of criminal justice professionals. The public systematically underestimated the severity of sentencing patterns, which was significantly related to attitudes toward sentencers. When asked to provide a sentence in a specific case of burglary, respondents favored sentences that were on balance little different from, and if anything more lenient than, current sentencing practice.   It is worth remembering that the media, and tabloids in general, prefer reports about the extreme and outlandish, and have little regard for the norm, which by definition is not news-worthy. This usually skews our perceptions about the state of things."
Switzerland,2mrhps,Nelav,1 point,Thu Nov 20 19:29:04 2014 UTC,"This Study was certainly about a spefic kind of crimes. It says ""full possession of the facts"". So this shows that they were showing examples of crimes that people could relate to or cases of revenge.  But if you have Rape, unjustified violence and stuff like that, the ""facts"" wouldn't have that much of an impact. There are no facts that can justify Rape...  The study you have right there is obviously made by a group that knew what result they want to get, before the study even started.  Also, this is not a swiss study - I was talking about switzerland.    I also want to post the post i posted above:       I feel like the punishment atm is low enough to almost make it a joke.     I mean, combined I probably spent more time at the hospital and dentist than the criminal would've gotten if he had gotten caught. Altough it was only a minor damage/injury.    If you get kicked in the head for no reason at all (seriously, none) you'd probably view every sentence as too low. Because to do something like that, you have to be a really really shitty kind of person. That kind of person deserves to be kicked out of our country.

Switzerland,2mscc9,Bakeey,5,Wed Nov 19 17:33:27 2014 UTC,"I will say it a bit provocative:  The National Bank knows better what to do with the Swiss gold than a lawyer, a graduate in german literature and the founder of a Wertpapierabrechnungsgesellschaft.  Edit: Simply, the arguments of the no-comitee are more convincing to me than the ones of the pro-comitee."
Switzerland,2mscc9,Bakeey,-2,Wed Nov 19 19:12:28 2014 UTC,I will also try to say my thought a bit provocative.  It is a fact that the national bank has imaginarily increased its assets to a factor 5 (quintoupled our money). It went from approx. 100 billion to approx. 500 billion. The argument that money can be invented perpetually and as much as need is more convincing than the argument that you need a form of security if economies collapse.
Switzerland,2mscc9,hikari-boulders,5,Wed Nov 19 19:44:07 2014 UTC,You know what the inflation of the swiss Frank has been the last couple of years? 0.3%. Your argument is invalid.
Switzerland,2mscc9,hopsafoobar,0,Wed Nov 19 22:59:11 2014 UTC,"Not necessarily. Inflation may have some intertemporal variance, like a lag or delay. If your argument would be valid, then we could increase our money to a factor of 5 every few years forever, keep 0.3% ""inflation"" forever, and have enough money to research all diseases, feed all the hungry, and give money to every school, the AHV/IV and pension fond. Your argument seems only valid if you believe in magic money imaginaton."
Switzerland,2mscc9,hikari-boulders,0,Thu Nov 20 06:49:41 2014 UTC,"Ok, I'll bite. Let's assume the Nationalbank created no new money for 10 years. The amount of things (that includes stocks) that can be bought with money however increases in the same time. More things for the same amount of money => Worth of money increases = deflation. Which sounds fun but it reliably kills economies."
Switzerland,2mscc9,hopsafoobar,2,Thu Nov 20 09:07:51 2014 UTC,"I don't know, something sounds not economically intuitive. Inventing money to a factor of 5, then pretending that we ""really do have so much, it's not just invented out of nothing"", letting it sit and then... deflation?

Switzerland,2mscc9,hikari-boulders,2,Thu Nov 20 18:21:34 2014 UTC,"I hope you understand that it's not the money that buys things, but the people who put their work into something.  Money is all about trust. If you get paid for your work you get a colorful piece of paper. In itself that paper is worth nothing. But luckily not only you believe in that paper but also the next supermarket. So you can exchange that piece of paper with something real like food.  But what happens when someone suddenly begins printing more money? Inflation. Because there is not suddenly more food or other goods. So for the same amount of work you still can only buy the same amount of food even if the number on your funny paper is bigger.  But what happens to your savings? Suddenly all your wealth has decreased!  Paper money is only worth something as long as we believe in it, gold is not. Because you can not print gold."

Switzerland,2mscc9,leealan,0,Thu Nov 20 17:02:49 2014 UTC,"I will vote yes. The swiss franc is currently fixed to the euro (meaning the national bank of Switzerland will keep buying euros to keep a stable exchange rate). And the euro is fixed to the US dollar.  Soo since the dollar is about to crash it will pull the euro down with it. And therefore also the swiss franc.  But if our money is not just fiat money but backed with something real like gold, the whole forthcoming economy crash will have much less impact on Switzerland.  Will the national bank of Switzerland have less options to juggle the numbers? Of course because you can't work (gamble) with gold sitting in a safe. Is that a huge problem? Well the ""experts"" tell us it would harm the economy.   But I don't care about the economy, I care about the people. Looking back in history it's the times that the people suffer the most when the economy thrives. So maybe we should care more about the people and sustainability than for the economy.  But sadly it wont happen. The Rothschild banking system is scared shitless and they will absolutely not allow the swiss people to do what would be best for us all."

Switzerland,2mrjxt,being_inappropriate,3,Wed Nov 19 12:24:11 2014 UTC,I'd recommend Lucern for a start. Really nice city. Of course don't forget the famous Kappelbrücke and you can do a nice excursion on the Vierwaldstättersee and go hiking on the Rigi or other mountains near there.   Zurich is quite near and has some nice things to go see. You can also walk along the Uetliberg  Other nice places would be in the Grisons (lots of mountains and forests) or the Valis (also mountains and a is basically one long valley). If you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes go to Meiringen and visit the Reichenbachfälle.   If you want to see where our politicians are go to Bern. I honestly don't know that city very well so I cannot give you any recommendations.
Switzerland,2mrjxt,T3chnopsycho,2,Wed Nov 19 13:21:09 2014 UTC,"I think Bern and Lucerne are both nice places to go. You could be in the mountains for some hiking quite quickly from both places, and they are both beautiful cities. If you really want to be in the middle of the mountains, go to Interlaken. They have a nice, modern hostel there, the lauterbrunnen valley is just around the corner, and there are loads of other places to go for hiking. The town itself isn't really pretty in my opinion, but you can easily go to Lucerne, Berne, Thun or any of the nice mountain villages that are in the vicinity if you want to see some nice Swiss cities."
Switzerland,2mrjxt,Iylivarae,2,Wed Nov 19 21:30:34 2014 UTC,"That depends on what you want.  Like old architecture? Bern and Lucerne are where you should go.  Want to party? Zurich and Lausanne are your addresses.  Prefer culture and museums? Try Basel and Geneva.  Prefer the outdoors? Consider Interlaken, Sion or Chur.  Like a more Mediterranean feel? Lugano, Locarno or Bellinzona would be good.  Like glitzy resorts? St. Moritz, Verbier or Gstaad come to mind."

Zurich is nice if you like cities, otherwise you will probably prefer somewhere else.  Bern is also very beautiful all year round, not as much a must as Luzern though.  Luzern is going to be your best bet, great city on a lake, surrounded by mountains you can hike/visit, you can go on a boat around Lake Luzern (Vierwaldstättersee) and stop somewhere for walks/hikes. Mount Pilatus and Rigi are nice, easily accessible from Luzern. Also, did I mention Luzern is in my opinion the most beautiful city in the world?"

To get the other stuff, I think you might have to do it through a physician, at least that's what I was told, and man was it fucking annoying trying to just deal with it.

I don't really know if these still exist today, google doesn't really help...  There is barcraft in Zürich (wiki, reddit, barcraft.ch) which is basically a meetup for starcraft fans to watch tournaments in bars around Zürich. It's like watching the football world championship in a bar, but with starcraft tournaments. (I'm not really a fan of starcraft, so it's nothing for me. But some of my friends love barcraft.)  This summer there was a minecraft LAN organized from the VIS of ETHZ, however this was part of a thesis so I don't know if it will happen again.  Nothing more comes to mind unfortunately...  Edit: Some more google-foo led me to the website of GameThat. They organize a LAN in St. Gallen every year in February (next time 13-15th February 2015). Unfortunately the website is only in German, but the organizers seem to be from IT so those people should know english if you want to contact them via email.

Switzerland,2mpi6j,hikari-boulders,2,Tue Nov 18 22:09:24 2014 UTC,"In this picture you see the history of the Bilanz of our National bank. Everybody (i.e. both sides of the initiative) think that having a Bilanz around (more or less) 100 billion CHF is a stable healthy thing. This graph is heavily tied to the Eurocrisis. When the Euro fell from 1.80CHF to 1 CHF the SNB declared to ""do buy Euro and do everything necessary to hold the Euro to 1.20 CHF"". This is why we have now 500 billion CHF.  We have now about 8% of our Billanz backed in gold. It used to be around 40%. If the initiative passes this would mean that the SNB would have 5 years time to, for example, downsize the 230 billion Euros we have accumulated such that our gold is at 20% again, or buy more gold (approximately 20 euro gold for every 100 euro we buy)."
Switzerland,2mpi6j,hikari-boulders,3,Wed Nov 19 09:54:38 2014 UTC,"If the problem is an to large foreign exchange reserve, and the reserve isn't backed by government debt (doesn't seem so with an GDP ratio to debt at 35 % ) Why not take the excess reserve and put it into an soveregin fond ?  Backing the CHF with an 20 % reserve in gold, could make an active monetary policy very costly."
Switzerland,2mpi6j,hikari-boulders,1 point,Wed Nov 19 14:08:13 2014 UTC,Could you elaborate more on what you mean? I think the main reason of the 20% lower limit (or of any form of hard backing money) is to disallow a government to invent an infinite amount of money when there seems to be a shortage of money.
Switzerland,2mpi6j,SwissBliss,2,Wed Nov 19 22:25:16 2014 UTC,"With the CHF as an international reserve currency and an ""safe haven"" under the financial crash and euro crises. The central bank did probably both print money and buy Euros to defend the CHF. Keeping supply up with demand.  Low bond rates and a relative low GDP/debt shows that the nation haven't paid costly for this at all.   A minimum 20% gold might leave the central bank with fewer tools to ""defend"" CHF in a new crisis, it would also be even more attractive as a safe bet with hard backing. Printing CHF and selling for some other currency would then have the extra cost of buying gold who also might be soaring.   I like the idea of backing the currency and strengthening the exchange reserve with gold. But mostly for a nation with a weak currency that would loose value in troubled times and for nations with large debts in foreign currency (like Ukraine or Hungary).  For Switzerland I’m not sure. There ought to be better thing to buy than gold if you want to reduce the size of the reserve.  But putting this to the vote is hardcore democratic. kudos"
Switzerland,2mpi6j,pseudoRndNbr,0,Thu Nov 20 21:18:01 2014 UTC,"They increased the money to a factor 5. ""Save haven"", stability and low GDP/debt and all the other stuff won't help much if this stuff goes on and on and on...  And a technicality, but still important: The nationl bank did not print money to increase it to a factor of 5. Because printed money (or ""minted money"") needs to be backed with 40% gold. They didn't print the money. They just let the bytes do some digital voodoo and poof - more money."
Switzerland,2mpi6j,Generation_Y_Not,2,Thu Nov 20 22:40:02 2014 UTC,"Simple Review:  Positive: It's meant to be safer than paper money because it has a physical value and cannot just be printed infinitely. That means the Swiss Franc could be safer.  Negative: We already have like 10%, so why add 10% more? A part of the law would be that we can't sell it... So effectively we'd have 20% of our money in bricks of gold that we can't use lol. In times of crisis the bank needs to be able to work its magic, and this would stop that.  Overall, I voted No, not because I think gold is a bad thing to have, but because of the ""can't sell"" part."

It is thus recommended to have a somewhat flexible schedule: Visit the mountains when the forecast is good and have a few activities planned for when it's not. For example, visiting the old towns in Gruyere, Berne, Lucerne, Zurich and Locarno (among others), Museums (Fondation Beyeler, Basel; Kunsthaus Zürich; Rosengart Museum Lucerne) and castles (Lenzburg, Chateau Chillon in Montreux) are good ways to spend rainy days.

Also I don't recommend just buying weed if someone's visiting, rather they should use opportunities over a friend or a friend of a friend, because in the big cities like zurich, you're likely to get ripped off with the amount and/or quality."

Also, I like reading about our culture seen from other perspectives... ;)  Regarding the swiss-german greeting ""Grüezi"" (or ""Grüessech"" depending on dialect); a lot of people ""swallow"" the first part of it and all you hear is ""..zi"" or ""..sech"", so that counts as the same in case you encounter that... ;P  Since you wrote a good part about the public transport, might want to reference the link to sbb.ch, since you can use that site to plan for all public transports.  Had to chuckle about the last entry with the weed... especially the part about the potency of it; ""Swiss tend to roll with tobacco for this reason""... it's true though. If you want to go straight to sleep for the next 10-12h, then roll without tobacco"

Switzerland,2ml8qp,Sophroniskos,3,Sat May 16 07:53:14 2015 UTC,"Grüezi - pronounced 'grootzee' with emphasis on the 'oo' which sounds like a 'u'. It means greeting, and basically everyone no matter who you are will say it as you pass, usually in shops and more residential places. You'll hear a few variations such as 'Grüezi Mitenand' which is basically 'greeting group/collection of people' Wie viel? - pronounced 'v feel', simply means 'how much?', this works well with pointing. Ich heisse - pronounced 'ik highser' means 'my name is' or 'I am'. Bonus points for replying with 'und dir?' which means 'and you' and is pronounced such as 'nd deer/dear'. Haben Sie ein? - pronounced 'ha ben see ine' simply means 'have you got a' then search for a word in a phrase book or point.    This is so cute, that's the typical english pronounciation of german words you have explained here :D  Here are some more tipps:   Grüezi: In Swiss german you really need to know how to pronounce ü, ä, ö. I suggest this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8nSVx9oiZc Ich heisse - The ""ch"" in ""Ich"" sounds really like when you try to hiss like a cat. As for ""heisse"": You pronounce ""hei-"" like a very short version of ""hi"" and ""-ss-"" like the 's' in ""I see..."" and the ""-e"" is really short as in the english word ""extra"".   The other two are alright :)"

Switzerland,2ml8qp,Urgullibl,3,Tue Mar 31 10:30:51 2015 UTC,"Bonus points for replying with 'und dir?' which means 'and you' and is pronounced such as 'nd deer/dear'.   It should be ""und du?""!  ""dir"" is more along the lines of ""your(s)"" while ""du"" means ""you"".   Also since we have polite form (of address) in our speech, one should be aware of the fact that saying ""du"" to a person of honor (generally everybody you don't know, is older than you or even teachers) can come of as disrespectful. In those cases one should use ""Sie"" instead (Note capitalization). So ""und du?"" becomes ""und Sie?"". Pronounced ""(u)nd doo"" and ""(u)nd see"" respectively.  Mostly people are comfortable with being, what we call, ""du~zt"" as opposed to ""Sie~zt"", just ask politely if you can ""du~z"" them. ""Kann ich Sie duzen? pronounced ""ka(hard n) ik see deuce-n)  PS: I know I'm 5 months late but since I'm Swiss I never took the time to actually read this post."
Switzerland,2ml8qp,LiamHTheProRedditer,3,Tue Apr 28 13:55:46 2015 UTC,"One other note - if you speak some German, be prepared that the various Swiss dialects of German are utterly incomprehensible to most German speakers, and you may have to ask them to switch to Hochdeutsch, and the Swiss generally stick to Swiss German regardless of which German dialect you address them in. And you really do need to treat them as a separate language.   Also, as you drift from tourist-rich areas, the amount of english spoken plummets, but is still your best bet if you don't speak the local language. (I.e. Someone in Neuchâtel is more likely to speak English than German, and someone in Zurich is more likely to speak English than French)"

But just by looking at their website and linkedin:   MWC group    Maybe I'm being unfair here but having looked through their CV on linkedin I find them a bit odd. They are all British and none of them seems to have worked in Switzerland before MWC. Not that this is necessarily negative but it's still a bit odd that they hire no locals with knowledge of the market here. Also their backgrounds aren't very impressive and sometimes quite weird. They all have a very sales related background and some worked in industries outside finance, some have trading/broker backgrounds. None of them worked in private banking, tax law or something like that before. Again, maybe I'm unfair here but my guess would be that they are going to be very focused on sales. Maybe they are have more an US type broker-client relationship model, where basically your adviser actively trades and invests for you. Maybe it's just expats in Switzerland that had to deal with all the issues of moving here and decided to make a business out of it. They present themselves very adviser like / conservative but the website looks quite cheap with a lot of fluffy language.   Thun Financial Advisors   I'm a bit confused about them because Thun is a small city in Switzerland but they seem to be based in NY without an office in Switzerland. I think the founder is Swiss and that's probably the connection to Thun. However, their backgrounds looks much more convincing to me. There were all mid-ranked people at banks / big four and have experience in finance, tax and so on. I would rather go with them.  I know financial advisers in Switzerland but they are more focused on Swiss people. However, I would recommend advisers instead of banks to be honest. Maybe http://www.englishforum.ch/ is a better place to ask your questions than here as most people here are Swiss and don't know so much about expats matters (especially US tax related things).

The article then complains about the bad drive to make schools more efficient (more kids/teacher, little training for teachers), which then also sounds like a bad idea. Sending more money to schools is not the easiest way to get elected probably though.  In general, humanity knows a lot more than we did 50 years ago.

Most teachers I had used old technology and only a few welcomed new technology to be integrated into their teaching. If you want to educate kids on these new technologies you have to train the teachers even more. They don't only have to become users, they have to become masters with those tools in order to be able to teach children these skills properly.  So yeah, totally agree with you.

Nach weiteren Nachforschungen konnte ich nicht nachvollziehen, wieso die Daten auf der SIM Karte 'sicherer' als auf dem Gerät selbst sein sollten - was gemäss der offiziellen Seite von Tapit der Fall ist.  Ich bitte Sie daher um ein Statement, wieso nicht der interne NFC Chips des Smartphones benutzt werden kann, in dessen Zusatzmodul die Daten ebenfalls verschlüsselt gespeichert werden (FIPS 140-2 wenn ich mich nicht irre).

Switzerland,2lvc2v,groie,3,Mon Nov 10 19:23:41 2014 UTC,"I happen to have some insight to the project. Swisscom really wanted to support all phones android and iOs alike. However the case with Google is that they do not offer drivers (on nexus phones) to contact the SIM-card to communicate with the credit card programs that are installed on the SIM. There is probably a long fight behind that the operators didn't allow google to install their stuff on the sim, and now google is preventing it from the operators as well. Also even if you think of all android phones the same, Sony, Samsung and HTC all support different standards for communicating with the SmartCard. These standards are driven by for example GSMA and Google.  Then why SIM and not XYZ? Let's face it, SIM is the only asset that Swisscom (or any telco) has in your phone, that is something they must leverage to differentiate from competitors. Also If you think of the chip on your credit card and the SIM card: these are actually very similar UICC-chips, thus it is a logical development going towards this direction. Swisscom approach also allows multiple credit cards to be installed on the SIM. These credit cards can be virtually from any bank (provided they set up their system to personalise credit cards on SIMs). These UICC chips also support a lot of asymmetric cryptography, so that only verified payment terminals are able to do payments.  What google is doing is that they have something called a ""proxy-card"" in their wallet, thus you do all the payments with google-credit card and you just feed money to this card from your other cards. This enables google to take the Issuer fee on all your purchases. As you can imagine the Swiss banks might not be super happy about someone forcing them to change their business and premium models.   I agree that at the end of the day the customer does not really care who gets to make profits out of their purchases. We just want to get our cigarettes/train tickets/coffee and be done with it. However all the businesses should consider the fact that if you don't stagnate your own business model, someone will do it for you. And I believe that in few years there will be global mobile payment solutions that enable us to pay everywhere - with every device. These local solutions are a step on that way. Maybe some of them manage to become local standards, but as of now I only see Apple as a strong contender for a global solution.  EDIT: These opinions are my own and they are not official views of Swisscom."
Switzerland,2lvc2v,LeSpatula,1 point,Tue Nov 11 07:42:55 2014 UTC,I hope we can get rid of the SIM card in the next few years anyway. They are an archaic unnecessary way to store information you cold also directly on the phone itself.
Switzerland,2lvc2v,groie,1 point,Tue Nov 11 12:19:48 2014 UTC,"SIM card is not actually a store medium - one should rather think of it as a small computer. You can give it commands and it will execute them for you.  However Cloud SIMs or Soft SIMs are personally very interesting for me. They could enable all kinds of cool stuff, for example the end for roaming as you could always buy a ""local"" SIM on the fly. However we'll see who (if anyone) will drive this change."
Switzerland,2lvc2v,groie,0,Tue Nov 11 12:51:11 2014 UTC,"Thanks a lot for your answer and your insight.  As far as I am aware, the Nexus devices work with other NFC Payment apps (Paypal, CurentC etc), so storing the information in the software does not seem to be a problem, only storing the information on your sim card. Since sim cards will not be around for long (at least in my opinion they are obsolete right now), I do not understand why any company would push a standard that will be obsolete as soon as mobile phone manufactures stop including sim slots in their devices and switch to software instead - Apple seems to go that route it seems.  I understand Swisscom wants to push a standard they can profit from, but please do not screw over the costumer. All NFC payment stations support Apple Pay, Google Wallet and CurrentC out of the box, the only thing needed is to flip a switch in the software (active API) - current situation in the US and their push with CurrentC. So to exclude devices, only because the OS prevents access to a component that is not build to be written to in the first place, does annoy me.   I would very much prefer a software approach, and not need additional hardware, but I understand that this is the first push in the direction of NFC payments. So I'll just wait and see how it develops and hope SIM-dependent payments do not become a thing."
Switzerland,2lvc2v,csssss_,0,Tue Nov 11 09:45:33 2014 UTC,"Nexus devices use something called Host-based Card Emulation. Basically one could say that the device connects to the Payment Issuer (google in the case of Google wallet) and fetches a list of payment tokens that can be used to authorise payments. When these tokens are running out, the application fetches more tokens.  With this approach the credit card information is stored in the cloud - not on the SIM. As we've seen with current breaches to for example iCloud it could also then be possible to steal this information from the Cloud. As all the information is stored in the same cloud, it becomes very interesting target as you could in theory get hold of lots of credit cards with one successful attack. However when this information is stored on the SIM, the most likely attack vector is to steal your phone or your SIM card and try to use that. This naturally will only expose the credit cards of a single user.  Now I must say that I am not sure how google exactly stores this information in the cloud, I expect they use different cryptographic keys for each user/card, thus adding an extra layer of security.  SIM card approach also has the advantage that it does not require your device to be turned on to function, it can power up almost entirely from the contactless field. In practice you will be able to do payments even if your phones battery is dead. This is something you will never be able to do when you need to power the main processor of your device to conduct payments.  I personally feel that the SIM based approach offers superior security and convenience of use. However the road of getting the right device, the right SIM, the credit card installed on your SIM can be a cumbersome one. After that, however, you're golden."
Switzerland,2lvc2v,csssss_,8,Tue Nov 11 10:59:30 2014 UTC,"Hi there! I work in the payments industry (as a Security Engineer). Let me shed some more light on this.  How do contact-less payments work? Contact-less payments are standardized by a body called EMVCo. In order to pay at contact-less locations, you must have an NFC card or device that implements the contact-less EMV standard. This is pretty much the same standard that is used for contact chip cards (for debit/credit cards), except it's contact-less. In the end, payments via NFC still need to be routed over a network rails that support EMV payments such as Visa or MasterCard.  Why can't I use PayPal? As far as I'm aware, PayPal does not support contact-less EMV payments. It only supports sending money (via NFC) between two devices that have PayPal installed. Therefore, you can only use it with merchants that use PayPal to accept payments. What you're really looking for something like Google Wallet or Apple Pay.  Why am I forced to use Tapit? Most likely because Tapit has an exclusivity contract with Swisscom. It's similar in the United States, where Verizon had an exclusivity contract with Softcard and therefore you couldn't use Google Wallet on Verizon phones for a long time. This has been an ongoing battle between Google and providers. If you think this is stupid, that's because it is.  Sidenote: What is FIPS-140? It's a federal U.S. government standard specifying functionality for cryptographic hardware modules. In order for a module to be certified, it has to implement certain algorithms and fulfill certain standards. It's also not a very good standard (most of these kinda suck). But it's a requirement to have this for PCI compliance (industry body governing payment card security standards)."
Switzerland,2lvc2v,csssss_,2,Tue Nov 11 06:41:11 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your answer.  Since you are a security engineer, maybe you can explain to me, why a Sim card is more secure then to store the information on device itself. If encrypted properly, it seems to me, the information on the device would be as secure as storing the information on your sim card. Enlighten me ;)  Thanks in advance for your answer."
Switzerland,2lvc2v,benz8574,2,Tue Nov 11 09:50:56 2014 UTC,"Information that is stored on a physical smart card is more secure since it's embedded inside a hardware module. It's pretty much this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module. In practice, Android's HCE is good enough though (and can also be backed by a physical chip depending on your phone)."
Switzerland,2lvc2v,P1r4nha,2,Tue Nov 11 16:03:16 2014 UTC,Thanks a lot for your answer :-) I think I'll need to take another and closer look at the whole situation to understand it better.

Switzerland,2lvc2v,lakmaran,3,Mon Nov 10 17:38:10 2014 UTC,It's pretty much the same problem everywhere in the world. We need a common standard that everyone uses but instead everyone wants to do it their own way in the hope of becoming The Standard. But no standard will take off this way. NFC should have become common already years ago. This happens with almost every major new technology in free markets. Just like we should have had digital streaming TV 15 years ago.

I think that's up to paypal to make it available and financially safe/interesting. Swisscom is all too happy to jump in and try to get some  cash by playing the middleman between customers and NFC terminals.  NFC != open payment platform.
Switzerland,2lvc2v,csssss_,2,Tue Nov 11 09:46:38 2014 UTC,"That is not actually true, contact-less payments are standardized by an industry body called EMVCo. That's the same body governing standard for contact chip payments. Their specifications are entirely open and can be downloaded online. Specifications for contact-less are here: http://www.emvco.com/specifications.aspx?id=21. The spec can be (and is!) implemented by anyone willing to take the time to do it (Apple Pay, Google Wallet, Visa PayWave, MasterCard PayPass, and many others)."
Switzerland,2lvc2v,billcube,1 point,Tue Nov 11 03:33:06 2014 UTC,"It's not about the hardware. EMVCo will not give you monies.  Once you record a transaction with a terminal (NFC, chip, web form), you have to submit it to a payment gateway that will actually process it and make the monies disappear from one account and appear in another.  In Switzerland, you have Telekurs, Datatrans, Postfinance (for the Postcard). It's a lucrative business because they get a % on the transaction fee.   Swisscom wants a part of this transaction fee. So they create a  payment platform, with a system (the app) that will allow them to receive the transaction request, and they will process it (through the credit card the user registered).   If Paypal wants to do the same, they have to make sure either they or one of their intermediaries contact SBB or the payment provider they use and give them a way to send the transaction data and to receive monies.  It's only  a question of contracts & money than a technical issue."
Switzerland,2lvc2v,csssss_,1 point,Tue Nov 11 06:08:10 2014 UTC,"Thank you, I'm well aware of how this works. It's a bit more complicated than you make it out to be though.  1) There's more than just Telekurs, Datatrans and Postfinance... those are just third-part payment processors, they are not network rails. The network rails would be Visa, MasterCard/Maestro, CUP, JCB, and a few others. You are free to integrate with them if you can get sponsored by an acquiring bank and then process transactions without going to a third-party payment processor. Since it's probably not worth it as a small/medium-sized business, you'll end up contracting with a third-party processor that does it for you. But you don't have to, by any means.  2) This is both a technical and a contracts issue. If you implement the contact-less EMV standard, you can interface with any contact-less EMV terminal and pretend to be a payment card. The NFC stacks in these terminals don't support anything else, there's no other option! Otherwise they would never get licensed under the standard.  I highly doubt Swisscom has created their own platform. If they are doing what you claim they are, the would have to a) pretend to be a debit/credit card issuer, b) have the mobile phone emulate a fake card, c) route the payment over a network rails to them, d) then re-route the transaction in their backend by routing over the ""correct"" rails for the customer. This is possible (it's how Google Wallet works) but it's extremely costly since you're essentially participating in two transactions so you definitely won't be making any money this way."
Switzerland,2luaub,ruggar,12,Mon Nov 10 07:45:30 2014 UTC,"Yeah, ""not block"" but they still allow themselves to slow down certain content from certain sites for business reasons, which is against the principles of net neutrality.

Switzerland,2luaub,P1r4nha,6,Mon Nov 10 08:18:19 2014 UTC,"That's not specified in their codex, but we can speculate about that.  For instance, let's say you use your Swisscom internet to watch Netflix, but Swisscom is now promoting its new TV 2.0 to which Netflix is competition (at least to a certain extent). Net neutrality forbids Swisscom to slow down Netflix to promote their own TV on demand solution. The codex mentioned in the article however does not forbid that. They might call you as a valued customer and promise you a much better and faster TV on demand solution, because, you have to admit, Netflix has been really slow in the past few months, right?

Switzerland,2luaub,lhatchy1,2,Mon Nov 10 23:58:14 2014 UTC,"I don't think there is evidence of purposely slowing down certain services in Switzerland yet. We know that some ISPs in the US are doing that on occasion.  We also know that for instance upc cablecom routes certain traffic in weird ways that caused for congestion problems in the past. If that was a business decision or a technical issue, I don't know.  The thing is, with all these internet providers entering new business branches that have hard competition elsewhere on the internet (Swisscom TV 2.0, Horizon etc.), they only now are starting to have an incentive as ISPs to filter (and slow down or block) the content they provide according to their benefit.  With their codex they say that they're not going to block any content, which is nice, but they still keep an option open to slow down any content according to any kind of rules, including business decisions. I think they don't go far enough and should vow to not discriminate against any content sources (maybe with one caveat: illegal or dangerous material).  TL;DR: No, not yet, but they keep that option open to them, which I think is a mistake. Strict net neutrality is important.  EDIT: I think I've found something that might violate net neutrality, but I'm not exactly sure how the deal works:  Orange offers exclusive deals with Spotify and Zattoo. AFAIK that means you can use these services without the data being counted towards your data cap. It's not slowing down other services, but the unlimited data they give you for one particular service gives Spotify and Zattoo an unfair advantage over their competition."

Your point on Spotify and Zattoo is basically the same thing, just the opposite way, although I think it's unusual to compare them. It's like branding at the end of the day, Netflix for example isn't directly losing speeds due to this. I wonder if this counts at net neutrality violation?  Good finds!

Switzerland,2luaub,altyr,1 point,Mon Nov 10 15:54:10 2014 UTC,"Yes, identifying ""schädlich"" is the core of the problem. Unfortunately it depends on the situation and it is impossible to draw up a bulletproof definition in advance.  In the end we have to depend on the good judgement of the involved people."
Switzerland,2luaub,markus_b,2,Mon Nov 10 10:13:29 2014 UTC,"""schädlich"" is obviously anything except swisscom tv :) swisscom tv is already a prefered service on swisscom's network (managed by qos)."
Switzerland,2luaub,NewfieCanOpener,3,Mon Nov 10 11:58:59 2014 UTC,"On the Swisscom network it probably is. If you are a SwisscomTV subscriber, then you are probably even happy about it and would be very rapidly very unhappy if the TV you are watching is stuttering.  I don't know where the potential bottlenecks are these days. I suspect the downstream bandwidth is probably sufficient, so it is not you watching Netflix vs your neighbor watching SwisscomTV.   But if Netflix grows rapidly it may be that the incoming link into the Swisscom network is not expanded fast enough, like it happened in the US with several carriers. So it would be you watching Netflix vs your neighbor watching Amazon video. Which one should QOS prefer ?  In the US the solution was TWC/Verison/etc ex-torquing money from Netflix to increase the interconnection bandwidth. Actually, as Netflix I'd add these interconnection fees directly to my customers bills. If you are on TWC you pay an additional 30ct 'TWC tax'. This mostly to show to the consumers how shitty their ISPs are. We'll see what happens here.   There is one important difference: Here in Switzerland I can change ISP, this is very limited in the US. Most places here have one cable (often Cablecom) and multiple DSL providers. Many in the US have a single choice, whence the high prices and low speeds."
Switzerland,2luaub,markus_b,2,Mon Nov 10 12:08:12 2014 UTC,"On the other hand, operators like Swisscom are charging a lot of money and are offering much better services than in the US. In my opinion, we are not ready to see any bottlenecks anytime soon (with Swisscom atleast).  Just look at the price of their subscriptions.. On one side you have 15Mbit/s downstream (and some trash upstream) for 109CHF. THEN, you have 100Mbit/s downstream and 20Mbit/s downstream for 129CHF.   The disparity is huge and my guess is that Swisscom hopes that their customers switch away from the ""standard"" DSL subscription they have for 50CHF to the new 109CHF one (because marketing mostly).  You cannot have bottlenecks with ridiculous prices like that (for such low speeds)."
Switzerland,2luaub,C4p5ul3,2,Mon Nov 10 13:02:27 2014 UTC,"I happen to be with a local cable provider, so I'm not that familiar with the Swisscom offerings. At the prices you mention I suppose these are multipacks, including TV (with DVR service), phone and internet. Also, Swisscom never was cheap."
Switzerland,2luaub,markus_b,1 point,Mon Nov 10 13:21:10 2014 UTC,Yes and we could use some more local ISPs as well in Vaud. And ı don't trust UPC or Citycable.
Switzerland,2luaub,C4p5ul3,1 point,Mon Nov 10 14:14:48 2014 UTC,"I'm with SEFA. Small and local. When there is a problem, I can call the engineer in charge. Love that !"
Switzerland,2luaub,markus_b,1 point,Tue Nov 11 00:07:20 2014 UTC,Switzerland must always be neutral!
Switzerland,2lwm7v,siriangibbons,5,Mon Nov 10 22:47:49 2014 UTC,Now what has that to do with /r/Switzerland?  Are you looking for /r/conspiratard ?
Switzerland,2lseqa,uncrocco,19,Sun Nov 9 20:00:38 2014 UTC,I'd buy a Swiss Pass instead if I were you. They cover 100% of the cost instead of just 50% - and full price train tickets are very expensive here.  There are those where you can choose the travel dates and those that just extend for a certain time - depends on your plans which one to get. Time to whip out some Excel skills ;-).
Switzerland,2lseqa,DeepDuh,9,Sun Nov 9 22:36:23 2014 UTC,"Absolutely, that's what the Swiss Pass is meant for. And it's exclusively for non Swiss, so if you guys travel enough, it would be worth it!"
Switzerland,2lseqa,obiwan90,2,Mon Nov 10 00:38:00 2014 UTC,And there is a Swiss Pass for two people which is cheaper than two individual Swiss Passes. Get this if you are likely to be travelling together most of the time.
Switzerland,2lseqa,MialoKoukoutsi,2,Mon Nov 10 13:26:47 2014 UTC,I'll jump on the Swiss Pass band wagon. It's an excellent deal and makes traveling around the country fantastically easy.
Switzerland,2lseqa,DantesDame,7,Mon Nov 10 20:19:11 2014 UTC,"Probably not worth it for you, but it's close. It costs 175 CHF for 1 year, so you need to figure out if you spend at least 350 CHF in travelling per person, which is hard to do in 1 week.   Half Fare Card does work for nearly all public transportation in Switzerland."
Switzerland,2lseqa,jonnyburger,8,Sun Nov 9 21:00:00 2014 UTC,"You can get a half fare card valid for a month for 120 CHF. https://www.sbb.ch/en/leisure-holidays/holidays--short-breaks-in-switzerland/swisstravelsystem/swiss-halffare-card.html  In this case, Swiss Pass looks like the better option."
Switzerland,2lseqa,rationalreligious,1 point,Mon Nov 10 02:07:46 2014 UTC,"thanks for pointing that out.  that's a pretty shitty deal, 120 CHF/month vs. 175 CHF/year :P I get that it's for tourists, but SBB overcharges them a bit, I think."
Switzerland,2lseqa,jonnyburger,3,Mon Nov 10 10:53:07 2014 UTC,"As /u/jonnyburger mentioned, the price is CHF 175.-- per person. You can go to www.cff.ch, price out your itinerary and figure out whether or not it's worth buying it. It applies to pretty much all public transport in Switzerland, including trains, buses, boats and mountain railways.  The Swiss Pass is probably the better option in your situation. If you're two people planning to do a lot of travel, check out the prices for renting a car, it might be cheaper."
Switzerland,2lseqa,Urgullibl,2,Mon Nov 10 00:07:31 2014 UTC,This might help.
Switzerland,2lseqa,Mr_Creeper2000,2,Sun Nov 9 20:48:16 2014 UTC,Often its not valid for cable cars etc.
Switzerland,2lseqa,weirdbreh,1 point,Sun Nov 9 21:39:09 2014 UTC,the halbtax is almost always valid. The GA on the other hand often gets you only the same discount as a halbtax.
Switzerland,2lseqa,futurespice,0,Mon Nov 10 11:50:43 2014 UTC,"Really? I've been to cable cars far and wide all over Switzerland, never once have they even needed a second look at my halbtax."
Switzerland,2lseqa,lhatchy1,1 point,Mon Nov 10 05:24:02 2014 UTC,There are other discounts for certain age groups (see gleis7 aka voie 7 aka track 7). https://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/railpasses/track-7.html  for <25 yo it is definitely worth it if you are planning on doing that much travelling and the timing works out for you
Switzerland,2lseqa,interestede,1 point,Mon Nov 10 05:19:25 2014 UTC,"also if you plan early enough ahead of time, sbb sometimes has some heavily discounted tickets, but only to particular locations/travel dates (http://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets-for-switzerland/supersaver-tickets/supersaver.html) supersaver tickets"
