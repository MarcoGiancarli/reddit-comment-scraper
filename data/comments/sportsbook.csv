Here's what I like today:  -Cubs/ Reds, 1st game Hendricks vs. Leake (Hendricks rocking a 0.45 ERA over his last 3 performances, hoping he can keep their bats quiet for an inning. Leake with a 1.8 ERA in his last 3, is likely to be traded so I'm hoping he puts out his best stuff to impress some teams)  -Marlins/ Diamondbacks (Fernandez is looking like he's back in full form and Ray is pitching really well for the D-backs lately, giving up 2 runs or fewer in 7 of his past 9 starts)  -Cardinals/ White Sox (Danks is coming off a 6 inning shutout performance friday and looked good doing it, also the Cardinals haven't been able to score when Lynn is on the mound. Lynn had pretty decent numbers against the WhiteSox first 5 hitters last time he faced them)   -Mets/ Nationals (I like Zimmermann on the mound for the Nats he's been lights out in July. Syndergaard gives me some worry though. Going to look into this matchup further when I wake up before making any play on it)   For ML picks I'll update later in the day, need to get some stats in order first.

sportsbook,3e2ric,CodeNewfie,3,Tue Jul 21 14:46:58 2015 UTC,"Often times books will take a hard line on where they'll stop a line movement to balance their potential loss. Of course there is risk involved, but it's calculated +value risk for them.  Bookmaking is all about playing the long term, as a -110 vig will always lean in their favor over time. That's a projected 2.83% ROI long term assuming the players are hitting just around 50%, which most players don't. These companies often take on enough customers that they can tolerate a minority of players winning above 55%+, as the majority of players are either losing or under the 53% mark.   Parlay/Accumulators of course will be promoted because they tilt the odds in even higher favor of the book. They are extremely profitable to the book.   Some books employ tactics like line shading as well to tweak the odds in their favor."

sportsbook,3e0da5,rs1x,26,Tue Jul 21 00:00:46 2015 UTC,"Wei-Yin Chen’s recent struggles have largely been hidden due to all 6 of the HRs he’s allowed over his past 4 starts being solo shots. His strikeouts are way down (5.89 K/9 in last 4 starts vs 7.36 K/9 on the season) and none of the teams who have hit 2 HRs against him in those last 4 starts are particularly great vs. Lefties. The Yankees, known more for their success vs RHP, are actually quite good vs southpaws as well. In fact, New York currently sits 6th in wOBA vs left handed pitching despite having one of the worst BABIPs in baseball (.274) within the same split. For Baltimore, it’s as simple as the fact that they are facing an overrated righty at Yankee Stadium. That formula alone is typically worth about 4 runs, especially with an offense as consistent at the Orioles. I’m on the BAL/NYY O8.5 +100 for 2 units.      This one barely made the cut, but I’m seeing just enough value in the STL/CHW Under 7.5 -115. These respective offenses struggle vs the pitching arm they face Tuesday night (White Sox vs RHP and Cardinals vs LHP). Really, the only concern I have is with Rodon’s walk tendencies and how a veteran team like the Cardinals, who work a ton of walks, might get to the bullpen sooner than later. Luckily, one of the few things Chicago is good at is limiting lefty bats with their relievers. This should either keep a sub-optimal Cards lineup in the game or result in some positive match ups for ChiSox relievers vs the better St Louis lefty bats.     I’m definitely in the minority, but I’m definitely of the belief that Cleveland makes a strong run for a Wild Card spot and are a very live team when considering the AL title. I also like Cleveland on Tuesday night -128 at Milwaukee for 3 units. You might feel a little uneasy fading one of the hottest offenses in baseball right now, but aside from this recent run, Milwaukee’s offense has only been so-so on the year, and the fact that they are free swingers isn’t likely to play well against a pitcher like Salazar who thrives on swinging strikes. Speaking of patience, the Indians have it in spades and have the 2nd best BB% vs RHP in baseball at 9.00%. Matt Garza’s 3.00 BB/9 is right at his career average and he really struggles in games where he walks 3 or more batters (Brewers are 2-5 such starts). I’m also looking to Cleveland to break out a bit vs righties, as their .278 BABIP (2nd worst in baseball) is only going to improve.      Low air density forecasted, strong wind to right center, and two rookie pitchers on the mound facing lineups with pop. Why yes, I’d love to take the BOS/HOU O8.5 -105, please.      Ugh, why do I do this to myself? I’m taking the Blue Jays -105 and backing my nemesis Mark Buehrle for the second time in as many starts. The Blue Jays offense should have a field day vs Graveman, who’s offspeed stuff is not a good fit at home in Oakland where air density is routinely in the 68+ range (his xFIP is a full point higher at home). I’ll never understand why smart teams like Boston and Oakland, who play their home games in traditionally high air density environments, keep wasting money on offspeed pitchers. It’s like they looked at the data around air density upside down. Anyway, Graveman is an autofade in Oakland anytime he’s facing a strong lineup like Toronto’s. I have nothing positive to say about Buehrle other than the fact that Oakland struggles a bit vs Lefties and hopefully that trend will continue on Tuesday night.     The winner for nonsensical line of the night goes to San Fran -122. Heston is a far better pitcher than Despaigne. The Giants hit righties (5th best wOBA in MLB) and the Padres don’t (3rd worst wOBA in MLB). In a pitcher’s park like Petco park, you really don’t have to go much deeper than that. Still, the line is bugging me out a bit so I’m sticking with just a 1 unit play here."
sportsbook,3e0da5,EL_Apostrophe,5,Tue Jul 21 12:34:45 2015 UTC,"I was really liking the Indians too, it's just killing me that Salazar has no experience against a Brewers line up that's seeing beach balls at the moment. I suppose the first time through the line up the advantage would be to Salazar, but I don't know about the rest of the game... I always get nervous about shit like this. Do you have any knowledge about similar types of match ups and who is favored in this scenario?   edit: to be clear, I'm talking about match ups between top pitchers vs top offenses with no history between them."
sportsbook,3e0da5,-fry-,8,Tue Jul 21 13:25:17 2015 UTC,"Don't get caught up on short term recent stats. Brewers haven't exactly been tested over this short offensive outburst. Just look at the crappy pitchers they've been hitting.  And while we don't have actual historical data for Salazar vs the Brewers, we know Salazar's strength (getting swinging strikes for Ks) matches up perfectly with Milwaukee's weakness (free swingers who rarely walk)."
sportsbook,3e0da5,EL_Apostrophe,2,Tue Jul 21 13:29:02 2015 UTC,"Those are definitely valid points and I totally agree. But sorry, I edited my comment because I realized it wasn't clear what I was asking after I posted it... I'm curious about who is favored historically in a match up between a top pitcher vs hot offense with no history of facing each other, not necessarily this game in particular."
sportsbook,3e0da5,-fry-,4,Tue Jul 21 13:50:56 2015 UTC,"Lol, I gave you a better answer. Your question is too broad. Define ""hot offense"" vs ""offense that has faced bad pitching lately"". Even defining a good pitcher is tough as there are a few different kinds of good pitchers. And you cant discount the other half of the equation: How the ""good pitcher's"" offense matches up vs the opposing pitcher that night.   Even if you were able to distill down a report that showed historic success of a good pitcher vs a hot offense (however you'd define the two) you'd end up with noise and not a predictive result."
sportsbook,3e0da5,EL_Apostrophe,4,Tue Jul 21 14:00:53 2015 UTC,"lol, sorry, I'm drunk. I'm not concerned with the opposing offense or pitcher, just the pitching/batting match up I had mentioned (broad, I know). I see your point in that there would be static and that's exactly why I was asking... I think this is something that there aren't really stats on, it's an experience judgement. I've only been following baseball for a few years and while I've learned a ton and am pretty good with analyzing stats, there's a lot of intangibles that only come from watching 1000's of games. This is one of those things I know nothing about that I wish I knew."

I don't know how else to put this, but any way you look at the numbers, be it metrics, run diff, pitching stats, standard batting stats, etc, they are a bad team. It's not even that they are literally just a hodgepodge of middling overpaid players, it's that they arguably play in the toughest division in baseball which makes their deficiencies that much more pronounced. The Padres are bad, they are not good, they will not even sniff a WC this year or anytime in the near future. Oh, and they plan on gutting house it seems."

I think they were the beneficiaries of some matchups, and that's a case where a smudge can end up looking like a streak.  Nothing in my data has the Pads as ""hot"" team. In fact, the bot thinks they've underperformed expectations in their last 10 home games.  Still, I'd say that the Pads ought to be decent value going forward, if for no other reason than because conventional wisdom is now tilting pretty hard against them.   I could easily see them being an MLB version of what the Nets or the Lakers became in NBA -- a shitty team that offers +EV MLs because everyone thinks they're dogshit."

The lines are usually overpriced on them against even mediocre teams just because on paper the padres look decent. I hate betting on them because a) they are unreliable in every sense of the word (they somehow even manage to elude statistical probabilities more than other teams...not a provable fact, just something I've noticed over the season) and b) their ballpark is just brutal to hitters. But just based on metrics they don't have much going for them, so yeah sure they'll win games but the data backs up playing them like once every blue moon.

Admittedly, I haven't been confident enough with my baseball stuff to start scaling up yet.  Today's a pretty exciting day for me in that regard, because this is a much cleaner data data-wise than I've seen in a while.  I was actually rather proud of getting through yesterday with a profit, since there were a lot of picks that had to be tossed out because of weather fronts (KC vs PIT, for example). Today, in fact, a game was moved into the pile because of weather (TOR).  Obviously, I'm very curious to see how all that plays out."

Coulda been a little shitty if they were all losers, but I'm not cashing out stocks or anything to fund my hobbies.  However, I will go full degen every now and again; prop bets during bcs and march madness come to mind, but I drop those bets down to site minimums just to have fun on a weekend with nothing else to do.

Granted, I had to make a lot of mistakes before I really started to trust myself and not go back to smaller units after a few shitty days. If your system works when you're betting $1 units, it should perform just as well in terms of ROI at $100 or $1000 unit sizes, just gotta be really sure what you're doing is a winning strategy before bumping it up. lol.

It has taken forever to get a handle on how to get batters vs pitchers to lineup and then factor in weather in a sensible manner.  Baseball is suited to a clustering model, but there isn't a clean interaction between offense and defense in baseball. In football, a team's defensive and offensive philosophies can become hand-and-glove.  Look at the Seahawks.  With baseball, you're basically compiling data for two whole games for each matchup. In the absence of field position or turnovers, baseball can be weirder than other sports, especially in terms of just trying to say, ""Okay, Team A is going to do this, and this is how Team B will respond.""  One great thing with football is that the sport is very driven by a series of challenges and responses, and you can build a clear behavioral model of something like the Colts-Pats games from last year, where you could clearly identify a death spiral that would ensue once the Pats took a lead.  Baseball is frustrating in that sense, because there isn't the same clear relationship between styles of play. Instead, it's just basically a question of how fucked the SP is relative to L/R and fly/ground ball matchups and the weather."

Both teams have better defences than they do bats so I'm hoping it's a low scoring affair) (LOSS)  -3/4 tonight not too shabby hopefully tomorrow's as profitable!

Yankees scoring 7 runs in the first inning would be the same as them scoring 1 for the prop but for 1st innings run scored count it makes it skyrocket.  Is there a count of how many times a team has or hasn't scored in the first inning regardless to the number of runs?
sportsbook,3e0da5,jmurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:47:50 2015 UTC,"The only team stat I've found relating to 1st inning runs is the one from teamrankings.com that shows 1st Inning Runs/Game, which like you said, can be a bit skewed if a team has a few first innings with a lot of runs. However, at this point in the season, I feel like the sample size is large enough to avoid skewing the results significantly. When I see a team like the Yankees averages over 1 run per 1st Inning at home, I stay away regardless."

That nearly gives you a 1 run per game average over 10 games even if you go 0/9 in the other 9 games.  But yeah between how their ball park is, their iffy pitching, and how they can hit at home I wouldn't touch a No on them ever at home.  My favorite to watch out for in regards to the No runs scored in the first inning bet is sometimes the book goes weird and if you have a 1st inning 3 way bet I've seen Tie have better odds than No runs scored in the 1st inning a times.

Came off a 4-1 day with it on Sunday and didn't like any of the games today, so I stayed away from it (and I think there were only 3 games today that had no run 1sts). Tomorrow, there are a few that I'm confident in, so I figured I'd throw them out there for you guys:  Mets/Nationals (-155) 2u (WIN)  Cardinals/White Sox (-140) 1.5u (WIN)  Blue Jays/A's (-140) 1u (WIN)  EDIT: Last second addition (7:00pm PST) for those of you who check this right before gametime...Decided to throw in Giants/Padres (-150) 2u (WIN)  EDIT: To appease /u/packen4...Record: 71-39 (+14.5u)"

That's coming from someone who is averse to the no-runs -- I hate this prop and almost never take it. If Cheese were just going by the stupid small criteria you say, he wouldn't be so far up. Any lame-o bettor, from the vast majority who will never post on or read a site like this and hardly ever research their bets at all, could make racks on the No Runs if it were as easy as you claim because it's a bet designed to appeal to (and bankrupt) impatient suckers. This whole run by Cheese is, if nothing else, a testament to the fact that if you do your research you can find value anywhere."
sportsbook,3e0da5,VirtuaSaturn,0,Tue Jul 21 13:45:32 2015 UTC,I agree that you can find value on this prop. But when you are betting heavily juiced lines you cannot beat the book in the long term. It's that simple. It's hard enough to win on - 110 lines.   Also how much is cheese up? Have you notice he used to post how many units he was up but now he's stopped doing that? Besides I'm just giving him a hard time. If he's winning then it doesn't matter what the bet. But winning for months is impressive. Anyone can get hot for a couple day or a week.

Cool stuff to think about."
sportsbook,3e0da5,konosay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not so much excited as interested to see where it goes. The games today will expand the data significantly compared to where it has been, since there hasn't been much overlap lately.  That said, it's still a long way off. I wouldn't go declaring it an effective approach until it starts getting toward 200 picks, which at the current rate may not be until this time next year."

I remember having a version of this convo early in basketball season, and the truth is I'd prefer something closer 1,200 picks.  That said, there's a limit to what you can realistically try to do without expecting to be dead before you accumulate enough data. That's one of the reasons I dabble in so many sports (that and the fact that I want to prove that a clustering model works in multiple leagues).  It's a tough balance. If I were treating it as a purely scientific inquiry, I wouldn't be laying any money on anything until I had years of proof to back up the theory. That, however, just isn't very fun."

sportsbook,3e0da5,konosay,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:47:27 2015 UTC,"http://www.analytictech.com/networks/hiclus.htm  Hierarchical clustering, when used with a machine learning algorithm, is almost the stats equivalent of a brute force attack.  I use an approach that mixes in decayed grades for each game in order to encourage the bot to ""forget"" older games.  The basic concept is to say, ""This team plays A, B and C types of games, and that team plays A, C and D games. I betchya if those two teams played, they'd only play type A or type C games.""  It works really well in football because some teams are incredibly prone to playing certain types of ball against each other. For example, you could always bet that the Rex Ryan era Jets would play the Pats very close."
sportsbook,3e0da5,-fry-,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:53:30 2015 UTC,"This is really interesting. I'd never heard of this before, Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics is the only formal course I've had involving stats, and this theory isn't exactly covered there.   Ponying on another comment you left...   Baseball is suited to a clustering model, but there isn't a clean interaction between offense and defense in baseball. In football, a team's defensive and offensive philosophies can become hand-and-glove.   I'd argue that fielding shouldn't even be a factor in this. Maybe an incredibly small factor for teams that are highly prone to errors, but I see most of the defenses in baseball doing what they should without huge variations between them; shifts, infield in, etc., as any other team would in the same scenario. There may be some variation in how well it's performed, but not nearly as pronounced as you'd find in football or basketball.    One great thing with football is that the sport is very driven by a series of challenges and responses  Baseball is frustrating in that sense, because there isn't the same clear relationship between styles of play. Instead, it's just basically a question of how fucked the SP is relative to L/R and fly/ground ball matchups and the weather.   I think you've solved your own problem there. It's easy to overthink complex scenarios, but when you get down to the root of baseball, it's just about how well a guy can throw a ball to prevent another guy from hitting it really far. Ok, I'm OVERsimplifying now, but the point is the same. I suppose pitching with runners in scoring position and late leads / relief pitching scenarios would play a part in the scenarios you're looking at, but I think it's a fruitless cause to try and identify how teams will react within the game outside of that."
sportsbook,3e0da5,grinnifwin,2,Wed Jul 22 10:07:11 2015 UTC,How do you bet -1 lines? Do you do it the manual way or does your book offer it?
sportsbook,3e0da5,konosay,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:46:10 2015 UTC,"It depends on the book. I use 5dimes, and they only offer the -1 on the fave.

Help me determine if ""Vegas Dave's"" MLB picks are legit or not. (His picks for this week are inside).  Hello,  I've been crunching a lot of numbers to figure out if ""Vegas Dave's MLB pick system"" is worthwhile.  My goal is to answer the following questions:  1) What is Vegas Dave's formula for picks?  2) Is Vegas Dave's methodology truly profitable?  Background:  Vegas Dave Oancea is an immature, childish, and stupid human.  According to his website, he took out at $10,000 student loan in college and put all $10,000 on the roulette table in Vegas... yes, he is that stupid.  Website for more: www.itsvegasdave.com  Vegas Dave sells a ""Picks Package"" you can subscribe to each MLB season.  Subscribing to his picks is very expensive.  Two things are included in this package:  1) The methodology for the system  2) Weekly picks to implement the system methodology on.  Vegas Dave totes that this system currently has a record of 29-1 this season and 104-3 over the past 2.5 seasons!    The Picks Package for Week of 7/21/2015:  1) Methodology for System Plays:  ""Each bet is a part of a system play. A system is a 3 or 4 game series. If you win game 1 then the system is over. If you lose game 1, you double your bet for game 2, etc. until you win.  For example, Detroit plays at home against the Orioles this weekend. It's a 3 game series. For game one you would bet $10, if you lose you would bet $20 for game 2 and then $40 for game 3.""  2) Weekly picks email from Dave for 7/21/2015:  ""This weeks system plays are as follows Thursday July 23rd we are taking the pirates its a system one bet Friday July 24th we are taking KC this is a system one bet. Follow the rules on the welcome email on how to play the system bets and series. Also follow the unit system so u have enough money to plays games 3-4 if need be. Im looking to have 50 min system plays total of the year as we had 30 last year, so far this year we had 30 at the halfway mark. Manage your money and your units, we will have losses so prepare for them although my goal is a 49-1 an overall record for this year.""  My Analysis on Vegas Dave's Methods:  1) What is Vegas Dave's formula for picks?  I believe the formula is pretty straightforward:  A team that is top 1-2 in division, playing a home series 3-4 games, and rarely get's swept at home.  I'm not confident I've figured out his exact formula and that's why I'm trying to get some more help on it.    Here are some fast stats from this weeks picks:  Thursday July 23rd we are taking the Pirates its a system one bet Pirates vs. Nationals at home, 4 game series Pirates ranked 2nd in NL Central (54-38) Nationals ranked 1st in NL East (50-41)  His picks: Friday July 24th we are taking KC this is a system one bet. KC vs. Astros at home, 3 game series. KC ranked 1st in AL Central (55-36) Astros ranked 2nd in AL West (51-43)  Why did he not pick these series to play?  1 in AL West Angels playing #3 in AL West Rangers at home in 3 game series  1 in NL Central Cardinals playing Braves #3 in NL East at home in 3 game series  2) Is Vegas Dave's methodology truly profitable?  This is the most important question.  Is Vegas Dave's methodology any more profitable then following a basic system strategy like in blackjack where you double your money each time you lose until you win and start over?  Why not just choose one team and not worry about the series and continue to bet on them until they win?    Some interesting insights I've found in my research so far include:  ""How often does the home team win at least one game in a 2 or 3 game series, or one of the first 3 in a 4 game series?  Also how about at least 2 games or more in 2,3,or 4 game home series?  From 2007 through early June 2012, the home team won at least 1 game of a 2 game series 76.4% of the time (compared to the 75% you would expect if every game was a coin flip). The home team won at least 1 game of a 3 game series 90.4% of the time (compared to 87.5% in a coin flip league). The home team won at least 1 of the first 3 games of a 4 game series 89.6% of the time (again compared to a random value of 87.5%). And the home team won at least 1 game of a 4 game series 94.6% of the time (compared to 93.8% in a totally random world). The same values for away teams were 72.8% (win at least 1 of 2 games), 83.0% (win at least 1 of 3 games), 82.8% (win 1 of first 3 in a 4 game series), and 90.0% (win at least 1 of 4 games).""  Which means the odds of winning at least 1 of 4 games at home is 94.6% compared to a totally random world which was 93.8%.  If Vegas Dave's record is really 104-3 he's been around 97.2%.  But, I've also seen reports where his record is actually 27-3 in a season which is right on par with a totally random world at 93.7%.      TL%DR:   Thanks for reading and I'm really looking forward to some insightful discussion!"
sportsbook,3e0da5,Silky_1,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:56 2015 UTC,"Even if this guy is legit (which I doubt), that is a really misleading record.  Since it's a chase system, every 1 loss is probably at least 10u or so.  So if his record is actually 27-3, there's virtually no way you're making money since every win is about 1u and every loss is going to be 9-10u (or more).  Add in the fact that:    Subscribing to his picks is very expensive   And I'd say you have a losing proposition on your hands.  Not to mention the size of the bankroll you'd need to follow through on the chase.  You'd most likely need a credit system.  Also, after perusing his site for a minute - Vegas sportsbooks don't let winning gamblers stroll in and drop $100K on anything.  His system will probably work short term, but when it goes bad, it will go very bad."

It looks to me like you're saying that if you knew before the season started which teams were going to be the best ATS at home, then you bet on those teams, you could make money.  Isn't that like saying that if you knew ahead of time how many games each team would win in total, then you could do really well betting season totals?  What am I missing?"

sportsbook,3e0rp3,murrayyyyy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:18 2015 UTC,it's not too unreasonable to believe the same roster will produce the same result. depth is what wins spreads but I also keep a track of who's winning to confirm my suspicions https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ikdtcwK5z-ywxAipPwv5dN1FzfUM4BwCx3gV06e8IMs/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true  the important thing is that eight teams were above 55% at home ats. that's an 8/30 chance of picking a profitable team. looking at data only bumps that up. my conservative prediction is the rockets will not fall below 55% at home ats. GSW has a lot of hype for winning a championship so I'll have to wait and see
sportsbook,3e0rp3,afwfq3fa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:39:50 2015 UTC,"It's very unreasonable.   My proof. Go back to the season before and see what the top 5 teams are and what would have happened in 2014-15. I think it's pretty safe to assume that the top 5 did not cover @ a 53% rate. Off the top of my head, the Suns were the best team at covering in 13-14 and you showed they covered @ 50% in 14-15 at home. That's a loss with the vig."

I only look at home ats. the deviation is too low for overall ats. two years ago Pelicans were the best. they were 3rd best 2015. thunder second. 6th last year but with a hurt Durant. the rest of those teams had line up changes
sportsbook,3e0rp3,afwfq3fa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:33:17 2015 UTC,"The Thunder were coming off a lineup change also. Maybe you knew Steven Adams and Andre Robertson would start 60+ games. Personally, I doubt it. Also how much were the Thunder games adjusted for Durant. Is this when they covered a higher percentage of their games. Also you are throwing darts with this scenario. If you had documented that Pelicans and Thunder were the play then we would have more to look at but you are only showing the successful ones. What happened in those other 3 scenarios?  Just trying to show the other side of it."
sportsbook,3e0rp3,murrayyyyy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:48:34 2015 UTC,well you can read into the hornets collapse but they were third in 2014.

Everyone who watched the last fight between Dillashaw and Barao remembers what it looks like to see a content Barao get worked for 25 minutes. What everyone seems to be forgetting is the absolute beast of an athlete and fighter we've seen multiple times from a hungry, determined, and focused Barao. Dillashaw is getting finished, mark my words.  Tate, again, is tunnel vision on Rousey. The UFC doesn't give a shit about seeing that fight again. If it was a rubber match it would be a different story (A rubber match is where one fighter has won one of the fights and the other fighter won the rematch, giving them both one win and one loss and setting up the determining third match for the true victor). Tate lost twice to Rousey, both by armbar, and she's still only concerned with it. Eye is nobody to overlook, and she's absolutely dangerous. I see Tate completely underestimating her and getting finished either in the first or later rounds.  Regarding the Miller fight, see the other comment on this thread about him for my thoughts.   Watch out for the new-comer Holbrook. His record says all subs, but that guy is a MONSTER on the ground, with subs and ground-and-pound. He is going to shake up the division and give a lot of guys trouble."
sportsbook,3dvx90,euthanatos,2,Mon Jul 20 18:47:02 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on everyone except Barao. He looked very unexceptional against an unranked Mitch Gagnon, to the extent that I thought the fight was basically even going into the third round. Two years ago, Barao was running through guys better than Gagnon, which makes me wonder if the beating from Dillashaw took a toll on him. Sure, he's still an excellent fighter, but the bad loss to Dillashaw, followed by a weight cut so bad he was pulled from a title fight, followed by a lackluster performance in what should have been a 'gimme' fight...the combination of those things doesn't give me much confidence in Barao here.  Also, I actually think that the UFC might do Rousey/Tate III if Tate gets another win or two. They have an established rivalry, and Tate is the only fighter to make it out of the first round against Rousey. I think she still has a better chance of beating Rousey than any other fighter currently in the division, and I think she could have actually made the second fight somewhat competitive with a better gameplan. Given how entertaining their first two fights were, I'd definitely pay to watch that again."

sportsbook,3dvx90,euthanatos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:32:43 2015 UTC,"Sure, but that was super short notice and Dillashaw still won every round by a large margin and was never in any danger."
sportsbook,3dvx90,billythepilgrim,2,Tue Jul 21 16:24:25 2015 UTC,My point is that Dillashaw turned in a lackluster performance against an unranked fighter after a full camp. Soto didn't have the luxury of preparation of any kind.
sportsbook,3dvx90,euthanatos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:19 2015 UTC,Soto was already scheduled to fight on that card. They both had full camps; they were just preparing for different opponents.
sportsbook,3dvx90,billythepilgrim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:43 2015 UTC,"You're right, my mistake. However, I think that makes the whole ""short notice"" thing a wash for both sides then."
sportsbook,3dvx90,euthanatos,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think it was a big advantage for either fighter, but the lack of a clear gameplan combined with basically a 'no win' scenario for Dillashaw contributed to him being more hesitant than usual. I didn't see that as a lackluster performance; it was just a cautious one, perhaps overly so."

Coming off your first loss in almost ten years will certainly screw you up. He performed excellently though and subbed him nicely. It's a super hard fight to call.

Also my thought on Koepka is that it is a solid value play as an underdog, he has been absolutely crushing the ball, amongst the leaders in GIR % and average driving range. He has played progressively better each day, with some experience playing without heavy winds I could see him shooting a 67/68 tomorrow."

sportsbook,3ducy2,FadeTheKnicks,4,Sun Jul 19 15:45:56 2015 UTC,"Betting tonight's PPV is a little trickier since a lot of the matches tonight will lead to similar matches at Summerslam, one of WWE's ""Big Four"" PPVs. As with any bet, do not tail blindly and only place bets you personally feel comfortable with.  Lesnar vs. Rollins It is a guarantee that there will be some sort of interference in this match, whether it's Undertaker, HHH, or possibly even Ambrose. Also, it's important to consider that RAW has been experiencing some of it's lowest ratings ever, and everytime reports like these come out, the champion is usually thrown under the bus. The only thing that helps Rollins's case in this situation is that he is one of HHH's pet project (outside of kayfabe), so HHH may be a little more forgiving. Regardless, my personal take is that Lesnar will win the match either by pinfall/submission or by being the winner due to a DQ on Rollins's behalf.  Reigns vs. Wyatt This is 100% a feud that will continue into Summerslam. Reports this morning are that Luke Harper will interfere on behalf of Wyatt and reunite with him, but the question is whether the interference will lead to a DQ (and thus a Reigns win) or if the interference will be unseen by the ref or a mere distraction that leads to a Wyatt pinfall. I think it will be the latter, with Wyatt getting the win. As for Summerslam, I'd expect either Reigns/Ambrose vs. Wyatt/Harper or Reigns/Sting vs. Wyatt/Harper.  Cena vs. Owens The narrative of this match has been Owens costing both Cesaro and Rusev their title matches against Cena in an effort to ensure he gets to be the one to take the title off Cena. I'd expect Cesaro and/or Rusev to play a part in this match, but like in Reigns vs. Wyatt, their involvement could be a mere distraction which leads to a Cena pinfall or their involvement could result in a Owens win by DQ. At Summerslam, expect Cena (as champion) vs. Owens vs. Cesaro, and possibly even a Fatal 4 Way with Rusev included if Rusev vs. Ziggler isn't happening. As for tonight, I expect Cena to win by pinfall/submission after a distraction by Cesaro."

They also have libraries on wrestlers so you can type in something like Barry Windham and pull up a ton of his matches.

You should call customer support and ask why you're not able to make any dollar bets."

Today is a little scary, there are three easy matchups in my opinion to stack, the first being TiP against TDK, GRV vs T8 and TL vs NME.  We run into problems here with the prices.  Somewhere you have to spend a little less or you can't hit these match ups.  For the most part this roster is by the stats, Hauntzer and Altec are big players for GRV and I expect a bounce back game today going against a T8 team that has looked solid but still not top tier. I expect a close game and hopefully Hauntzer and Altec can put out solid points as they seem to do even in losses.  As with every week I suggest GRV players in almost all match ups because of their consistency and today they have a weaker match up so I think it is smart to hit it hard.  TiP vs TDK is probably my favorite match up but TiP are also expensive.  I think it would be hard to make a complete roster going big on both GRV and TiP players so sadly I can only afford to go Rush.  I think the other TiP players are modestly priced and could be swapped in for either Altec or Hauntzer but I went for consistency over big upside.  I think TiP vs TDK has a chance to be over quickly and won early by TiP and I expect that Rush will have a big part in that if it happens.  I also am running Rush as SC just because I think this is the type of game he thrives in.  The saver bet would be making Altec your shot caller.  Xpecial and IWDominate are both good value, TL didn't look great yesterday but I don't see NME being able to handle Liquids strategic play.  Piglet could have a big day but I could not afford him so I will ride Xpecial and hope he mirrors Piglets stats assist for kills.  The biggest risk today was having to take Shiphtur and Kiwikid going against TSM.  We all know TSM is playing bad right now, and there are hints of inner turmoil.  TSM will always have talent, and that scares me but I think Dignitas will be riding the high of a dominant performance from yesterday and will win today, and if TSM decides today is the day they are going to turn it around I believe it will be through individual talent which will most likely lead to a bloody game ending with Dignitas points either way.  I see value in Shiphtur and Kiwi but do not expect games like they had yesterday.  If you would rather not bet against TSM, then a few of the T8 and C9 players are similar prices but also not great match ups.  Nien has looked strong and could be a nice flex instead of Kiwi but to afford him you would have to trade Goldenglue for Shiphtur which I'm not ready to do.     Top Projected Scorers  -Rush(32.40)  -Apollo(32.11)  -XWX(31.94)  -Impact(29.67)  -Altec(29.23)     Top Value Players-DPP=Dollars Per Point(based on projections)  -Adrian(42.3 DPP)  -Bunny FuFuu(44.9 DPP)  -Impact(45.4 DPP)  -Rush(45.5 DPP)  -Xpecial(47.1 DPP)     Thanks for reading and play safe this week, 50/50s and Double Ups all day.

I think there is a chance the US clicks and scores a differential of 3 or 4 but their not really a team that puts up high numbers anyways. I would venture to say the game goes 3-1 for the US but it's kind of too risky for my own blood.

I use a combination of sources so I can fact check myself, but I mostly use Sherdog and the event wiki(if one's available) because the layout of those two help me to input the data faster. The wiki also has the most information regarding changes or oddities about a specific event.  I'm actually gonna start making others to go along with these that focus on specific percentages like takedown averages, strikes landed, etc. I have a few other ideas in the works as well.

This is the type of game that goes over 10. I'm thinking 7.5 is way to low. Especially with it being Feldman's first start back from the DL.

sportsbook,3dn5aa,2princes,3,Fri Jul 17 21:06:33 2015 UTC,"I'm liking Bradley(+275) and Koreshkov(+105) big time.   Bradley hasn't been finished since 2010, and by Luke Rockhold of all people (next in line for the UFC middleweight belt). It's debatable if his wrestling is better than Honeycutt's, but he almost certainly applies it better in his MMA game. I see a decision win for Bradley.  Koreshkov and Lima are pretty evenly matched, but a huge factor for me is that Koreshkov has been evolving his striking game fight after fight while Lima has seemed content with his current arsenal for quite some time. Again, it could go either way. Both of them have only been to championship rounds once (both in losses to Askren), but I find this to be a worse match-up for Lima than it is for Koreshkov.  The odds on Caroll(+600) don't take Ward's recent skid or how they match-up into account at all, but he missed weight and he's really not that technical of a fighter so it might be too risky to advise as a pick. I would advise the over 1 1/2 at +135 though, I doubt it ends in the first round.  I also see an opportunity for 4/5 underdogs winning tonight (Bradley, Koreshkov, Bear, and Carol) although I certainly wouldn't advise putting money on it. Page is an amazing fighter, with some of the flashiest striking yet seen in the game, but his maturity level is questionable and he may not be taking Bear as seriously as he really should. I believe it could go past the first at the very least, the over 1 1/2 is at +135 and not a terrible pick at all."

While already leaning towards Cloud 9 in this match, upon researching weekly scrims/team morale I noticed that some of Enemy has been sick all week indicating that they most likely have not had a lot of time to prep for this game.  Enemy is also coming off an 0-2 week where it seemed like morale got very low.  For a first split team, not used to losing this can be very troubling.They seem to be blaming each other for individual mistakes which breeds tilting.  This along with sickness in the house puts them at an extreme disadvantage going into this week.  Cloud 9 hasn't looked fantastic but with another week of Hai under their belt, they should be able to take Enemy with ease.    4 units Cloud 9       Impulse 2.11 over Team Solo Mid 1.68- Impulse blue side/TSM fan vote.  Tough one here.  It is really hard to get a read on TSM. Some days they are able to win from behind on the back of Bjergson, other days they can not overcome the deficits they somehow get themselves into.  It still seems like they have lackluster ADC play and from the recent coaching fiasco yesterday, I can not imagine team morale is too high.  Impulse is a team that is completely capable of individuals making plays and getting ahead early, the exact play style that TSM is vulnerable to. 3 units TiP       Team Liquid 1.64 over CLG 2.19 - CLG blue side/Team Liquid fan vote.  Team Liquid should win here but just like CLG, Liquid has odd games where they just look terrible.  I am skipping this one as I think the odds are very accurate.  I do not think CLG will continue their slide and actually think they'll start to play better.  This could go either way with a slight lean towards Liquid.  skip       Gravity 1.37 over Dignitas 2.99 - Gravity blue side/fan vote. Gravity is on a 6 game winning streak, knocking off Liquid, CLG, TSM, and TiP in that streak.  They are easily the best team in NA right now by a decently large gap.  Dignitas started out the season with a bang but have dropped 5 out of their last 6.  Dignitas seems like a team susceptible to tilt having been dismantled by Cloud 9 last week.  Gravity is a safe bet here. 6 units Gravity       Team Dragon Knights 2.0 over Team 8 1.77 - TDK blue side/Team 8 fan vote.  Tough to side with TDK here but their raw skill has to come through soon.  Team 8 is the perfect team for them to have another coming out party.  Although Team 8 has been playing well lately, TDK's korean players have yet to be able to get a good game under their belt.  They have had a tough schedule of CLG, TSM, and Liquid with the one game they should won being Enemy.

Poland is just a tier above the Serb team in my opinion. Serbia needs a win to stay alive but I just don't see it happening. I wouldn't take Poland -1.5 +130, but Im confident in them ML.   Also interesting, USA started the day -105 and +1.5 -185 but when I checked 20 minutes later, they are now -130 and -1.5 +145. They served AWFUL yesterday, but fully could have beat Brazil. Missed serves and hitting errors sunk them. France is HOT right now and played very well against Brazil the day before, so I am wary about this. Probably still will put a little on USA ML because they are just to good to go 0-2 in the World League Finals. Tail at your own risk. USA! USA! USA!

sportsbook,3dkxge,GOAT_1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:41:14 2015 UTC,I can’t give away all my secrets but there are multiple factors that I take into account. Few of the reasons I like the Pale Hoes in this game are:  -Big one today is motivation an @home day game first game of a doubleheader in against a mediocre righty pitcher. The Sox think that they have a chance to contend if they come out flat out of the AS break there is a good chance that they may dismantle the team and look ahead to next year.  -Shark has pitched well at home  -Sox offense has finally woke up should touch up Volquez for 3 or 4 in the early going and he will be out of the game by the 5th inning  -Price +180 is good return as I see the final score being 8-1  -???  -Profit
sportsbook,3dkxge,droosong,4,Fri Jul 17 12:36:33 2015 UTC,"This is a hilarious explanation. The word ""motivation"" should never be in the same sentence as ""White Sox"" without the word ""no"" in front of it. The Sox are painful to watch, they swing at first pitches constantly, and are beyond awful with an 0-1 count while Volquez doesn't have a problem challenging batters with a first pitch in the zone. There is no doubt Samardzija is the better pitcher by leaps and bounds, but by most metrics the White Sox have the second worst offense in the league behind the Phillies. Think about that for a second."
sportsbook,3dkxge,GOAT_1,2,Fri Jul 17 13:10:50 2015 UTC,"Wow 8 runs for the white sox is bold ...they've score 8 once once in their last 35 games , and it took extra innings."
sportsbook,3dkxge,GreenSpyro,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:12:35 2015 UTC,I don't put much weight on streaks coming out of the break. Momentum is non-existent at this point everyone is going to be a little out of sync. Sox put up 3 runs in the 1-2 innings and then another 2 during innings 3-5 at that point I think Yost will save his 3-headed monster for the second game and go with his lesser known middle relievers and they will give up the remaining 3 Shark should go at least 8. So that's how I see it who knows I could be wrong.

sportsbook,3dkyu3,WinchestersFinest,5,Fri Jul 17 02:54:17 2015 UTC,"Someone asked me to share my picks for this weekend, because I luckboxed a full card parlay on Wed :)  Here is my full card parlay for Saturday  http://i.imgur.com/hxkLjTP.png  I also parlayed all the chalk on Bellator, only pays 2-1 lol  No straight bets on bellator.  I see lots of people on Leites, but I am going to bet Bisping.  Probably 3U.    No value on Pearson, might be some small value on Evan.  I think the line is pretty accurate tho.. Im passing.  I have 2U on Latifi to close a 2 leg parlay with Kevin Lee from Wed.  Obviously you cant go back in time to make that parlay now, but I would still consider betting Latifi straight or parlay him with someone else.  Stay away from Joanne Calderwood, she openly admitted her camp was horrible and her personal issues from her last fight are worse this time.  Unfortunately the line on Cortney Casey isn't good enough to fade JoJo either imo.  I would like a 1U straight bet on Vaughan Lee, but missed the boat when he was +160 or better.. don't like it as much at +130, but keeping an eye on it.  Even tho I got him at +160 in my full card parlay, I make those parlays with very little thought, and didnt really think about things for straight bets until after.  Thats about it.  No big stand out value lines that I see, but there are a lot of guys I dont know much about and didnt have time to research.  There is also a titan card Saturday, but lines arent out yet.  EDIT: 10/12 meh.. Lee quit / didnt show up, Pearson was a horrible pick"

Unfortunately the line on Cortney Casey isn't good enough to fade JoJo either imo.   Where did you read/watch that? She's seemed fine in her pre-fight interviews and really happy/motivated. She was so clearly flat for her last fight during her interviews as opposed to the ones I've seen.  However, I hate those odds. I was hoping that the home field advantage would make Jojo the heavy favorite plus her opponent is making her debut on the big stage on hostile ground. Cortney hasn't fought anyone too impressive so it's hard to gauge her talent level. If she was sitting at +400-500, I'd be on it."

sportsbook,3dkyu3,sdlkfjlsdkjfljksfd,4,Sat Jul 18 04:04:23 2015 UTC,"Bellator makes a ton of one sided fights to build up title fights and records. They don't have enough depth in each division to have competitive fights on the entire card, so mainly the main event and prelims are the only close fights, with the lower main card being easy wins.  Page/Ward/Daley at -237. Don't really see any of them losing so I'll probably throw a unit on that parlay. They're obviously building Page up to be a WW championship contender by around next year, and they're building Daley up for a main event with Koscheck. Carroll is a 16-11 can to get Ward back on a winning streak after losing to tough competition in Shlemenko and McCrory.  Paul Bradley at +230. This is going to be a really, really tough fight for Chris Honeycutt. Paul Bradley is a very experienced, ex-UFC fighter who has a pretty good record. He's a ground and pound type fighter who can easily out-control and out-wrestle you for a decision.   Andrey Koreshkov at +155. This fight can go either way. Koreshkov has only lost 1 fight in his career, to Ben Askren (who also beat Lima). He's beaten top competition in Lyman Good (hasn't lost since he fought Koreshkov and is now in the UFC), Adam McDonough (was 11-0 before Koreshkov, hasn't fought in a year since he lost), Nah-Shon Burrell (10-3 before they fought, he knocked him out in 40 seconds).  I really, really like Koreshkov tomorrow. He's at least going to be a very tough fight for Lima."

sportsbook,3dkyu3,fearLess617,3,Sat Jul 18 11:50:22 2015 UTC,"Bellator  Lima -170: Lima is a damn good fighter who has been out for over a year because of a knee injury.  His opponent has also been out awhile so I'm not as worried about it as I usually would be.  I just think Koreshkov will be outclassed here.  Lima has also fought the better competition in his career.  I like him here at -170.  UFC  Leites -105:  Ive never liked Bisping much but I definitely respect him.  He has been near the top for a long time now but I think he is finally starting to decline.  He was wrecked by Rockhold (no shame in that really) and I thought he would rebound well against Dollaway.  Instead he was nearly KOd in the first and then barely squeaked out the next 2 rounds.  I was sweating that decision.  Looking further back, he was completely out grappled by Tim Kennedy in a fight I thought he would win.  Leites is an elite grappler, better than Kennedy in the sub game especially.  I believe his bjj is near Jacare level.  He has also improved his standup lately.  Bisping is still much crisper on the feet but Leites has shown power and I think Bispings chin is a bit of a liability at this point.  I think Leites will get it to the ground and work him over to eventually find a sub or even a KO on the feet if he can land something.  Going pretty large on Leites and also putting some on the ""Leites in the distance"" prop for +205.  Dunham +200:  I think Pearson is a bit overrated at this point and Dunham is a tough guy and all around a solid fighter.  I just think this is a really good value play and Im hoping the line gets even better before I place my bet because Pearson tends to get a lot of support it seems."

sportsbook,3dj2io,EL_Apostrophe,21,Fri Jul 17 01:17:17 2015 UTC,"Alright guys, here you go:      While -155 (long gone, I know, but the current price is ok too) is a steep price to pay for the 2015 Marlins, if there was ever an instance that warranted it, Friday night is that instance. The Fish have their ace, Jose Fernandez on the mound against a team that struggles against all righties, let alone elite ones. Part of me wonders if the Phillies are getting a bit of extra respect here as a result of their hot offensive finish to the first half. But a 4 day break might serve to cool those bats off, and even with those strong couple weeks in the books, Philly still ranks dead last in wOBA vs RHP in 2015. Conversely, this match up plays out perfectly for this Jekyll and Hyde Marlins team. Miami has similar struggles vs RHP (4th to last in wOBA and dead last in ISO), but crush lefties, even without Giancarlo Stanton. When looking only at active rosters, Miami comes into Friday night with baseball’s 3rd best wOBA vs southpaws and an ISO just a tick below one standard deviation above median. Not too shabby. And if his first 3 career starts are any indication, Adam Morgan is the exact type of lefty you want to face if you’re Miami. His .419 wOBA and 3.86 HR/9 allowed to RHB rank among the league’s worst, despite the small sample size.      Coming into to the season, Jake Odorizzi and Drew Hutchison both found there way to my short list of value pitchers that I wanted to back often throughout the summer. And while their 4-2 record in games where I bet either one of them has brought in some scratch for me so far this year, I think the best is still yet to come as the second half is likely to see their traditional stats catch up to their advanced metrics. That said, if there is a hole in either of their games, it’s Odorizzi’s home/road split. Luckily for him, Friday’s weather forecast for Toronto is likely to force the Jays to play with a closed roof, which will help the Rogers Centre feel more like home for the Tampa Bay Ray. No doubt the Jays hit pitching of all kinds, but they are slightly worse vs. RHP and in their two previous dome meetings vs Odorizzi, they were held to just 2 runs over 14 innings and struck out 16 times with a BAA well below .200. Keep an eye on the status of that roof, but assuming it’s closed, I love the TB/TOR Under 8.5 -120.     Speaking of guys on my underrated pitching list, Trevor Bauer heads to the Great American Smallpark on Friday night. Unfortunately, this is not one of the times where I see value in backing him. In fact, the play here is CLE/CIN Over 7.5 -105. Even before we get into the pitchers and lineups here, I am at a loss as to how books can set a total this low for game being played at the GABP, with forecasted air density so low (58) and forecasted humidity so high (70% to 80% as the game wears on). I’d consider the over on that basis alone even if the pitching match up featured Bob Gibson and Cy Young. And this Bauer-Leake match up is a far cry from that. Bauer is a better pitcher than you think, but when he struggles, it’s typically against patient teams like the veteran Reds lineup, which has the 2nd best BB% in the NL. They also hit incredibly well at home (partially thanks to the park), ad Bauer’s been known to give up the long ball. And so does Mike Leake. Being a sinker ball pitcher, the low air density may actually help Leake out a bit, but  don’t be fooled by his recent success. Leake’s June turnaround came against the likes of MIA (2x), MIN, PHI (2x), and PIT. This Cleveland team already toasted him for 5 runs in 4 innings back in May. How quickly the books forget.      The A’s are another steep favorite I like on Friday, but Oakland -165 is just way too low for this match up. Sonny Gray is the real deal, particularly at home and particularly against lineups like the Twins’. A -165 line implies a win rate of ~62% but I see it as a lot closer to 67-70%. Erv Santana is a BP guy when facing a lefty-heavy lineup like Oakland’s. It also doesn’t hurt that the wind is forecasted to be blowing out to right at a speed of 15MPH."

Thank god Volquez didn't start that 1st game today and saved us all a little money that Samardjza would've lost us.  1st Inning No Runs Scored Prop  WARNING: I got absolutely crushed the last few days before the All-Star break. I don't know if it was just shitty luck or what, but I'm starting to get a little more cautious with this prop.   Rays/Blue Jays (-125) (1.5u) little risky here but fuck it, I like these guys pitching (WIN)   Mets/Cardinals (-155) (1.5u) (LOSS)  Giants/Dbacks (-120) (1.5u)  Let's start off the second half on a good note!   Love,  Cheese  P.S. I also kinda like Orioles/Tigers Under 8 (-110). I usually have decent luck with Totals but I would love to hear thoughts from you guys before committing to it."

sportsbook,3dj2io,MEXTASIS,8,Fri Jul 17 16:08:25 2015 UTC,"verified record  TDiBH: (1941) Thanks to the outstanding defensive work of Indians' third baseman Ken Keltner, Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak ends in Cleveland's Municipal Stadium in front of 67,000 fans. The 'Yankee Clipper' who batted .408 during the stretch, will begin another streak that will last 17 games, extending the remarkable span of hitting safely to 73 of 74 games.  No time for writeups today, but here are my picks:   BAL ML (+105) MIA ML (-165) NYY ML (-165) COL ML (+122)   A couple points:   It might be a good time to put some money on the Yanks winning the AL East. Odds are they make a big move for an SP before the deadline (my guess is Cueto) and with another quality arm, there is no reason that they shouldn't increase their divisional lead. Cashman be cray cray. Which leads me to my next point...look for the Reds (among others) to fire sale. Cueto, Leake, Bruce and Chapman are all probably gone. Other teams that will probably be gutting house are the White Sox (probably won't gut, but Samardzija among others is on the board I'm sure), Padres, Brewers, the Phillies and maybe the Rockies. There are probably 10-13 teams looking to buy talent, and over half of them are more than likely looking for SPs. This is an awesome article about why the Padres are so bad this year It's depressing for Pads fans, and this article confirms what most baseball enthusiasts suspected, that Preller veritably ruined the Padres for the next decade or so. For anyone interested in placing future divisional bets, here are my guesses:   AL East - Yankees  AL West - Tough one...but I think the Astros pull back ahead once they get another pitcher  AL Central - Royals  NL East - Nats  NL West - Dodgers  NL Central - Pirates. I think the Cards won't do enough at the deadline to shore up their offense, and will fall behind the Cubs. The Pirates are a sick team, and I think are good enough to win a World Series.  Anyway, should be back to writeups next Monday. I've been super swamped at work lately. Cheers to everyone, feel free to ask questions."

sportsbook,3dj2io,fellbot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:34:02 2015 UTC,"Man, the Padres have all sorts of issues. Not only do they not have a shot at their division, they're 7.5 back of the WC and will get worse before they get better. The damage that Preller did to the team can be minimized if they package away their players whose contracts end next year (Justin Upton, Kennedy, Venable). It makes sense for them to part with Upton if they get literally any sort of prospect back in return."

sportsbook,3dj2io,Muhjestik,7,Fri Jul 17 20:49:19 2015 UTC,I love the under(8) in game 1 of the Royals/Wsox.   Samardzija Is in top form. His last 2 starts have been great. The sox offense continues to struggle though. Near the bottom in almost every category. Averaging just over 2 runs per game in their last 3. They are up against Volquez and the Royals. His last 2 starts have been good as well. 10.1 IP/2 ER. One of the teams being offensive heavy Toronto.  I see this game at ~5 runs. Any thoughts?

sportsbook,3dj2io,VirtuaSaturn,7,Sat Jul 18 01:38:11 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that trends ""fade or reverse"" but teams re-adjust their expectations as a team based on their likelihood of making the playoffs. So this greatly affects their day-to-day in-game decisions and leads some teams that are doing well to ""take their foot off the gas"" down the home stretch to save their players for the final push into the post season.   The biggest indicator of what a teams front office thinks of their current teams chance to get into the postseason is the moves they make at the trading deadline. This is where it seems that teams go all-in and rent a player for a few months in the hopes of using them in the post-season like Oakland did last year or they have a fire sale like Boston and spend huge in free agency I know it seems that these are the only two extremes but in fact the more successful teams stand pat with their original rosters such as the Cardinals and Giants who have one 4 out of the last 5 world series and the one they didn't win was when the Red Sox went worst to first and beat the Cardinals in the World Series.  Identifying if a team is playoff contender, wild-card contender, mailing it in, or in complete rebuild mode should definitely factor in when handicapping games.   Betting first 5 innings vs. full game is the best way to minimize your risk when betting on teams that have become apathetic to their playoff chances. I can't even count how many times a team has brought out a journeyman middle reliever to just eat innings as I hopelessly sit and watch a dead-ass under bet or an easy moneyline winner get blown up just because they really had no one else to throw after the starter and before the closer."

sportsbook,3djm27,stander414,3,Thu Jul 16 20:16:26 2015 UTC,"Still been doing well lately, even after jynxing it by posting here, so i figure i will jynx it again.  More Starcraft II action. Starting with GSL bets and will follow with IEM.  GSL  Impact v Flash. Impact ML. 3.32 -> 1u  Having watched both of these players play this matchup in the previous week, I was impressed how well impact played and not impressed with flash. Flash deserves to be a favourite, but not by this much.   Dream v Hack. Hack +1.5: 3.19 -> 0.5u  No real explanation for this one, kind of just took it because their names are DreamHack and I told myself i wanted to bet on it for the shits and giggles. Dream's worst MU has always been TvT, although he has been doing better lately (albeit against players whom he had played recently which suggests he merely adapted to his opponents style). This is a pure value bet and I would not suggest following unless you really really want to.  IEM  Parlay: Classic -1.5 & Rain -1.5: 2.580 -> 1u  Classic is on form, especially in PvP recently and Rain is Rain. These are both best of 3s (thanks Spooneh), so each of them needs to win 2-0. Rain will win 2-0 most likely, and might be worth betting on its own. Classic is less of a sure bet, but from what ive seen in his PvP lately he is super solid and wont lose to an inferior player.  TY v Losira. Losira ML 2.37: -> 1.0 u.  Losira is a weird zerg player and these are weird ass new maps. Stupid bullshit strategies are very valid (and expected) on them and I just think Losira will thrive in these circumstances.  EDIT EDIT!!!

sportsbook,3djm27,TheSpooneh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:02:31 2015 UTC,"EU LCS  Yesterday's matches were crap for betting so I didn't post picks, but today's have value.    Gambit Gaming to beat Unicorns of Love @1.80 (Result: Loss)    Gambit (7-8) is improving week after week, and are coming off of a dominating, well-played win over Origen, a team much stronger than their opponents today.   On top of that, UoL (7-8) has replaced their most influential player in Kikis with Gillius, a player notoriously average in organized competitive play who has barely any experience outside of the Challenger Series (lower tier). UoL's adjusted roster played yesterday and looked absolutely dreadful, the exact opposite of Gambit.  I suggest a medium-high stake.    Fnatic to beat Elements (Result: Win)  H2K to beat Copenhagen Wolves (Result: Loss) (WTF H2k?)  Double @1.31    Fnatic is Fnatic. At 15-0 they are the most dominant team the EU LCS has ever seen and are looking on-course to become the first team to achieve a flawless LCS season as well. Yesterday saw Fnatic defeating Roccat with ease and I'd rank Elements (6-9) as an easier opponent.  H2K (10-5) had a minor dip in form mid-season, but look to have regained their composure and are once again firmly looking like a top 3 EU team thanks to their excellent strategy. Copenhagen Wolves (2-13) are the absolute bottom of the table, and with good reason. They are dispatched of relatively easy by every team thanks to their lackluster team coordination and strategy, and this has only gotten worse since their management was forced to swap out many players who were leaving due to poor management. They haven't picked up a win since, and there's no reason to think they'll do so by beating a team that is back in form and top 3.  I suggest a medium-high stake.    LCS Betting Record: 35 wins 13 losses"
sportsbook,3djm27,Kashin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:13:54 2015 UTC,"Considering how Gambit are improving, it's weird to me that the odds are still rising. Its @2.00 on bet365 right now."

These are both best of 5s, so each of them needs to win 3-1. Rain will win 3-0 most likely (if there is a -2.5 line that shows up jump on it asap for anything over 1.9). Classic is less of a sure bet, but from what ive seen in his PvP lately he is super solid and wont lose to an inferior player.    Agree with these picks for IEM.  Also want to add Supernova -1.5 at 3.48/+248 3 units  Going by the numbers, Supernova has a slight edge in this TvT.  Supernova has had a good run against decent Terrans recently, while Heart has dropped a lot of games.  In a best of 3 the value here is great because in a mirror matchup it just comes down to who is in better form at the moment, and my money is on Supernova."
sportsbook,3djm27,Benwadabeast,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:11:35 2015 UTC,"Vulcun-EU LCS W8D2        Lineup:  Top-Odoamne  Jungle-Amazing  Mid-Ryu(SC)  ADC-Rekkles  Support-kaSing  Flex-yellowstar  Flex-Diamondpox  Flex-Cabochard     Explanation: A little change up today, I'm just going to link the stats I'm basing  my lineups off of, I play multiple lineups every day and I don't think it's fair that I try to pick just one to suggest.  So I'll give you what I believe is my favorite then I'll let you look at the stats for yourself because although I believe in my stats, I don't claim to be the greatest at interpreting them.     Looking at today's match ups it's pretty easy to ride the favorites because H2K is super under valued this week.  They're going up against a weak CW team that since their roster changed has given up a lot of points across the board(you'll see I removed the stats from before the swap as I think it's a completely different team stats wise).  Kasing is below $1,000 so I'm having him in every roster, Ryu isn't super cheap but he looked incredible today and I'll be choosing him as my SC.  Finally I'm going Odoamne, he's the highest value top laner and I think H2K has a better match up, also swapping Huni in will leave you with less money.  After seeing Origens performance today, I have very little faith in them, but Amazing is insanely cheap, and I don't think Origen will ever play as poorly as UoL did yesterday. Amazing is the one Origen player I'll take a risk on.  Fnatic going up against Elements is another nice team to stack.  Rekkles and Yellowstar continue to perform well even though today they won a little too cleanly.  I don't expect Elements to perform better than Roccat but I do expect them to play a little faster and bloodier, that's the Elements style.  I love going Fnatic players mainly because of how consistent they are(see CV's in last SS).  Finally to fill the last two flex spots I'm going Gambit against UoL.  Clearly Gilius is not prepared and UoL doesn't seem to have faith in him or know how to play around him.  After seeing today I think UoL could still be a upper tier team but not yet and Gambit looked great today so I'll be taking Diamondprox and Cabochard as they are modestly priced and talented players, especially Cabochard.      Here are the SS's of my stats.  http://gyazo.com/2e410b93aa4fa9b80e96c64c921cb50e  http://gyazo.com/8cf0de4b5992e7431b9f00b04a71f58b  http://gyazo.com/7d0e8d3acf9ba07009deb152a29e82f1  http://gyazo.com/18bf092217aeb4fc152546202c1f63fc  http://gyazo.com/314fa06594d1754fb2adac786588fa1d  http://gyazo.com/e6c020dab40518e1f8ae7e124fed3c59     The first five are Points Against for each position.  So the way they read is the points below each team are the points scored against them and the color of the cell is the team that scored those points.  The final page is the one I base most of my lineups off of.  Using the average of each player and the opponents percent above LCS average for points allowed to the corresponding position it gives a projection.  Kasing averages 19.09 pts, CW gives up 47% more pts to opposing supports than the average, Kasing is projected 28 fpts.  The CV is Coefficient of Variance, the lower the CV the more consistent the player is.  Using the salary and the projection the last column is Dollars Per Point.  I used Dollars Per Point instead of Points Per Dollars because it's a bigger more reasonable number, the meaning is the same.  Good luck guys let me know if you have any success.     Thanks for reading and play safe this week, 50/50s and Double Ups all day.

sportsbook,3dgh81,throwawaymymortgage,10,Thu Jul 16 02:09:45 2015 UTC,BOA are scumbags.  This was basically said to me from a branch manager after they were bought by BOA.  She all but told me to close my account and go somewhere else.
sportsbook,3dgh81,zambartas,3,Thu Jul 16 03:25:55 2015 UTC,It's the truth. Lots of locations is the only thing that can possibly be said in their favor.
sportsbook,3dgh81,rebelde_sin_causa,8,Thu Jul 16 08:42:37 2015 UTC,"1) I would just tell your wife. I mean, you have a little hobby that you have control of (I assume), no way to predict this would happen.  2) Bovada isn't going to help you. The absolute last, and I do mean last thing Bovada is going to do is go to bat for you against a bank located in the United States. They sent you payment, their hands are clean. They don't give a shit what happens to the check once they send it to you. The check wasn't flagged because Bovada didn't have the funds, it was flagged because it came from an institution the bank suspected was conducting illegal activities. If you tried to cash a check from a drug dealer and the bank did the same thing, you wouldn't ask the drug dealer to explain what happened to the bank / police / credit agency.  3) You need to talk to the Bank - You need to speak with BOA in person  - Try to convince them you didn't know it was illegal .. and also pressure them for more information.   Sorry to hear this. I have never heard of this happening - Show up to a branch location in person and try to talk to them is your best bet in my opinion. I'm not a lawyer, but I was under the impression that it was not illegal for you to cash the check, just illegal for the bank to cash the check. I'm not sure how you depositing the check you believe to be valid constitutes ""Illegal/Fradulent Activity"". I would try to dig for some answers from BOA there. I would think you could go in there, explain, and prevent them from reporting you. I would go ASAP though, like tomorrow .. Hopefully it's not too late."
sportsbook,3dgh81,whorunit,8,Thu Jul 16 02:28:46 2015 UTC,"I've never dealt with BOA, but work partly in finance and I just bought a house using the First Time Home Buyers program as well. I'd assume your fear is that this will appear on your credit report. Here's my advice:  1) You need to start by trying to clear this up with Bank of America. You need to be talking to their reps, not Bovada's, because as many people said, they will not help you.  2) This is a little known fact, but anything that goes on your credit report can be disputed. For instance, I had a collections account from Verizon back in 2008 that was illegitimate (basically they said I never returned equipment when I did). When I found out about that, I wrote letters to Equifax and Transunion explaining such, with receipts that showed I had returned the equipment. They removed it off my credit. So here's what you need to do. A month or so from now, assuming this hasn't been cleared up, you need to get a copy of your credit report to see if this shows up on there. If it is, you need to send letters to Equifax and TransUnion stating that it is an error, and should not be on your report. Once the agencies receive that letter, they have 30 days to prove its legitimacy. If they can't prove it, then they are legally obligated to remove it. Most of the time the agencies don't probe too deeply because it really isn't beneficial to them at all (they don't profit from being accurate, they profit simply from existing, really). My guess is that Chexsystem/Bank of America won't be able to prove shit.  3) I wouldn't worry about getting a loan. Yeah, they'll nitpick, but at the end of the day they want to loan you money. A lot of times if there's something on your report that raises a red flag all you need to do is provide some sort of explanation and they'll work with you to take care of it.  PM me if you have any questions, I'll do my best to help."

sportsbook,3dgh81,xanju,6,Thu Jul 16 03:53:53 2015 UTC,"They aren't keeping his money. He gets it back.   The problem is he's trying to take out a mortgage loan to buy the house. A mortgage loan is just a large loan from a bank. Bank of America is reporting his ""Illegal / Fraudulent Activity"" to ChexSystems which is one of the largest credit-reporting agencies in the United States. Before a bank issues a loan (mortgage), they check the person's credit history. With this fraudulent activity in his credit history, it's likely they will not issue him the loan, and he will not be able to buy the house."

Keep in mind that realtors and mortgage brokers WANT to sell you a house, and will do almost anything to get you that house.  So what you cashed a shady check, I'd be very surprised if it really affects your life long term.  There are mortgage guys who are in the business of fixing your credit, and they work with banks to get you approved etc, and they get paid very well (commission for doing it).  Have this be their problem, not yours.  Don't sweat it.  Next time go with 5D and you won't have this BS issue."

sportsbook,3dfhxm,stander414,2,Wed Jul 15 21:27:49 2015 UTC,"Vulcun-EU LCS W8D1        Lineup:  Top-Vizi  Jungle-Gilius/Dan/Kikis(whatever the fuck he's listed as)  Mid-Froggen  ADC-Rekkles(SC)  Support-Yellowstar  Flex-Vardags  Flex-G0dfred  Flex-Adryh     Explanation I don't know what I'm more afraid of doing, picking against H2K or picking SK after the shit show that supposedly has been happening, but ultimately I decided that Giants are more worth the risk than an SK roster that's on the verge of mutiny, quite possibly already there.  The only reason I have to make this decision is because the other match ups are pretty one sided, I want Fnatic going up against ROC and EL against CW.  UoL over SK is something I'm quite fond of as I think the remaining 4 UoL players are perfectly content and they won't struggle against an SK team that has little to no reason to do anything but not surrender at 20.  GMB going against Origen is something most people will be quite hot on.  I wouldn't put gambit on the level of Fnatic or UoL, both of which prospered against Org in the last two weeks.  Giants and Elements both suffered horribly to the ultra aggressive win fast style of Origen.  I would put GMB closer to Giants and EL which means I'm avoiding them today.  All of this to say I'm going Froggen to get almost guaranteed winning side points against CW.  Other Elements players aren't as tempting because of their costs and their inconsistency.  Also I'd much rather spend on UoL and Fnatic.  Vizi is a consistent player who also consistently is undervalued on Vulcun.  His salary is low and he is going against an SK team that even when they aren't mid coup gave up the most fpts to opposing top laners.  I think UoL jungle is a good play no matter who it is as I believe UoL is going to win big and any jungler in that spot will prosper fantasy wise.  My final UoL player will be Vardags, SK has only held an ADC under 18 pts 3 times this season and under 20 only twice.  Vardags is a great value if he can continue the trend of ADC points against SK.  Rekkles and Yellowstar going against Roccat is my favorite this week.  They're expensive but they should also be your biggest scorers today.  Fnatic is the most consistent team in the EU LCS and the only other team that rivals them in consistency, fantasy wise, is actually Gravity from NA.  Rekkles may be the 4th consistent player on Fnatic but ROCC has done a decent job against top laners and mid laners but still gives up 27% more fpts to opposing ADCs than the LCS average.  Yellowstar is the single most consistent player in the EU LCS and I'll be going with him as my support as I believe Fnatic will win and Yellowstar and Rekkles as a duo will do incredibly well.  The final two flex spots are where this roster gets iffy.  I don't like taking players against H2K, the stats say avoid this but H2K gave up about 15 fpts to Vardags and MrRallez and 26 to Rekkles in their last 3 games. For the cost, I believe Adryh can get 15 pts against what seems to be a faltering H2K squad.  Giants has shown some resilience to the top tier teams and I believe they can get their moneys worth.  G0dfred is an easy buy at $862 as he can get his worth with just a few points at that salary.    Top 5 Projected Scorers  -Rekkles(31.76)  -Yellowstar(23.56)  -Hjarnan(23.53)  -Vardags(23.35)  -Niels(23.29)  Top 5 Value PlayersDPP=Dollars Per Point(Projected)  -Rekkles(51.9)  -Vizicsasci(52.9)  -Yellowstar(56.5)  -Hyllisang(57.6)  -Vardags(58.3)        Thanks for reading and play safe this week, 50/50s and Double Ups all day.

H2K has lost four out of their last 6 games, two of which were to SK and ROCCAT, both much weaker teams.  Giants have somehow come out at 7-7 this week, right on the cusp of playoffs.  Giants have knocked off teams that were just not ready for them.  With the games being played on 5.13 and ~20 item changes occurring this week is the epitome of teams being unprepared.  The meta has not really been established yet although Runeglaive mid still seems to be very powerful.  This is the combination that Giants almost knocked Fnatic off with.  Of course, teams have learned to play around it but with Giants ability to upset, combined with the unknowns of 5.13 I believe Giants is the better side here.  Of course I believe H2K has the better chance to win this but the implied odds say that H2K needs to win 75% of the time which I believe is just a bit too high. I put this more at a 60/40 in the current state of both teams/meta.   2 units on Giants.       Elements 1.19 over Copenhagen Wolves 4.47 - CW blue side/Elements fan vote.  Elements all the way here for me.  Elements is going into their fourth week with this roster, the longest standing roster this split.  They are currently 3-3 with the roster but their losses are to H2K, Origen, and Unicorns.  They have beat the teams they should beat and the Wolves are absolutely a team they should beat.  The replacements for the Wolves have not looked so hot.  It looks that the Wolves are going to be auto relegated unless SK makes a dive in the last two weeks.  Elements are motivated with Nyph in the support role and should take this game with ease.  6 units        Unicorns of Love 1.35 over SK Gaming 3.13 - Unicorns blue side/fan vote. Unicorns will be debuting their new jungler, Gilius. Gilius is a meta jungler who is familiar with the team and should fit right in.  SK on the other hand has gone through a ton of drama this week with payment issues and threats to walk out of contracts.  It seems that Riot put their foot down and the SK players will play this week.  I would predict that they have not practiced much this week and are not feeling 100% all in on pulling SK out of auto relegation range.  The players are mad at the management and do not want to secure an LCS spot for them next split, as they know they will not be on the team.  SK management threatened the players with penalties if they did not perform.  All signs point to Unicorns taking this match as SK is in turmoil.  Unicorns have their sights set on playoffs and will need this win to contend.  There is definitely value here.  5 units on Unicorns.       Origen 1.3 over Gambit 3.35 - Gambit blue side/Origen fan vote.  If you were a Gambit fan this split, you're obviously sorely disappointed at this point in the season.  Facing them today is another tough matchup, one that they will most likely not overcome.  With Forgiven's cryptic tweets about not wanting to play for the team and Diamondprox's terrible play lately, Origen will most likely not have any issues with them this week.  Gambit notoriously is slow to adapt to new metas as well and 5.13 introduces a lot of new possibilities.  Look for Gambit to resort back to their old ways and Origen to adapt and play the new meta.  4 units Origen       Fnatic 1.15 over ROCCAT 5.15 - ROCCAT blue side/Fnatic fan vote.  Not much to say here.  Fnatic has shown they can win from every position in the game.  At 1.15 there is still some value here.  I would skip a straight bet but including in parlays is acceptable.  skip      Parlays   Elements/Origen/Fnatic @ 1.8 3 units Unicorns/Origen @ 1.85 3 units      https://twitter.com/esportsbettor     http://esportsbettor.cappertek.com  119-102 +77.23 units    +9.49% ROI     Join us at /r/esportsbook and /r/sportsbook     stander414 on KiK if anyone wants to chat esports"

Events such as CEO, EVO, and many more are available for sports betting but you have to find the right sportsbook willing to place odds up. 1Vice and Bovada are just getting into the scene and I'm excited (being a former professional street fighter player...

sportsbook,3dc5po,TheSpooneh,3,Wed Jul 15 03:05:54 2015 UTC,"CS:GO Cevo  Enemy over Mortality @ -292/1.35  To start, Enemy is a larger organization with a team in the LCS. Their players are very well taken care of. One of the biggest things to look for in Tier 3/Tier 2 Counter Strike is the chance of a throw in order to collect skins off their matches. Enemy is highly unlikely to do this because of their sponsorship and benefits as well as players who have a future in CS. That then takes us to the match. Mortality played yesterday and looked completely on tilt. They threw some big rounds and seemed overall, mad at each other. Listening to their comms, they were completely on different pages in some rounds and were raging. Enemy on the other hand has one of the best players in CEVO-Main, Koosta. This will be an easy best of 3 for Enemy, 4 units on Enemy."

He also beat Donaldson 6-4, 6-4 in a qualifier for Delray Beach (Hard Court). Donaldson took 3 sets to defeat Krajicek (awful grass court player zero wins for the year) in the first round, was bundled out in straight sets in the first round of Wimbledon qualifying, and though he has home country advantage he has already been beaten by JPS on US soil this year.

Italy +2.5 vs Serbia -125 - Serbia won the regular season matches 3-1 (winning 11 games, losing 7) with Italy winning at least a game in each of their losses. They lost at Serbia 2-3, 1-3 and split in Italy 3-2, 1-3. This game is on a ""neutral"" court but I believe that Italy will have the home crowd as Brazil (and neighbor Argentina) has a surprising Italian heritage. I think to get them at +2.5 -125 is a great deal.   Also I am confident in Brazil 1.5 -165 vs France today in the champions pool in the World League finals. Brazil is the host and also the winner of pool A (Serbia, Italy, Australia) going up against an undefeated France of pool D (CZR, South Korea, Japan) who advanced after beating Argentina & Bulgaria. This match up should be good with France riding a huge winning streak and doing very well in hostile away environments, but I see Brazil winning at least 3-1, if not sweeping.

sportsbook,3dbeg6,evaqua,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:48:32 2015 UTC,"ESPORTS; Dota 2: took max bet on bovada ($70) on  Tongfu. WanZhou (+165) vs SatuDuaTiga (-250) . I don't follow the T2/Sea scene too closely but I feel that tongfu is severly underrated here. If the info from GG is correct SDT has only played a handful of games as team(3 games), 2/3  against weaker SEA teams so they have a higher win % and I feel that this inflates their odds. While TF has taken games off better opponents, plays in a tougher region, and has much more team experience.  edit: game starting in about 2 hour and the line is moving more towards SDT, I still don't really understand how they are such a favorite,mb malaysian fanboys, or maybe I'm missing some crucial info but I'm getting quite paranoid that its becoming a trap and would be very cautious betting on this."

Going to have to put 1u on Under 7.5 (-120), and probably 1u on National League (-117) solely because their lineup just looks scarier to me.  EDIT: And 1u on No Runs in the 1st (-155).

sportsbook,3d2u60,DRUNKTENNIS,4,Mon Jul 13 02:06:45 2015 UTC,Hard to imagine anyone but Rousey here. Serena is winning but she's dropping sets left and right. If this came In august after locking up the calender slam then maybe their would be a realistic shot. Rousey's dominance is unquestionable and she's single handedly took Women's mma from a joke to a product as viable as most of the men's cards in just 2 years.
sportsbook,3d2u60,Nomsensus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:52:02 2015 UTC,Ronda won it in 2014 and Serena won the award in 2013.   I wonder if they'd really give it to Rousey two years in a row.   Edit:   I think it's more likely that Serena wins best female athlete and Rousey wins best fighter over Mayweather.
sportsbook,3d2u60,TheSpooneh,2,Mon Jul 13 14:15:06 2015 UTC,"Also, I feel awards like this are somewhat impartial to the current atmosphere in the world of sports. The ""Serena Slam"" and Wimbledon win are fresh in everyone's minds. Also, ESPN wants to really market the US Open (on their family of networks) coming up in a few weeks.

I'm sure Fielder's line is better than it should be because he's won twice before. His home run rate is the lowest it's ever been if you don't look at his rookie year, and last year when he only had 100 something ab. Take it for what it's worth."
sportsbook,3d2dbm,zambartas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:52:02 2015 UTC,That's a good point and all. I'm gonna try a tiny baby bet on Prince anyway I guess. 50 bux or so to see if he can still sock dingers like he used to. He knows how to hit 'em and regardless of what happens the dinger derby is always a lot of fun to watch.
sportsbook,3d2dbm,VirtuaSaturn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:09:14 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that a lot of those stats don't matter here; hitting in a game and hitting ""batting practice"" are two different things. My gut was to go Joc Peterson because he's definitely the most powerful one (highest single home run distance and average), but I think inexperience in a setting like this will come into play for him. Prince and Albert will probably win their respective rounds, but them getting tired is something to consider. Personally I think the AL has better candidates all the way around, but betting on the hr derby should only be for fun, because anything can really happen."
sportsbook,3d2dbm,j3rown,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:22:32 2015 UTC,"They might be two different things, but it has to count for something?  I remember stories of Boggs and Suzuki being able to crush the ball in batting practice, but they never really swung for the fences in the game, so I know that some guys that aren't know as HR hitters can win.  My money is still with the data, at least with the first round."

sportsbook,3d64by,IWasRightOnce,2,Tue Jul 14 13:57:25 2015 UTC,"Any major U.S. Bank has clauses in their ""terms and conditions"" (or whatever you want to call it) when you sign up that gives them the right to be weary of any questionable deposits. At my bank (one of the biggest in the nation) it specifically designates gambling as one of those questionable situations.  Here's the thing though, they don't actually care, they just need plausible deniability. My buddy (also goes to the same bank as me) tried to deposit a big check he got from Bovada and the teller called over a banker who took my friend back to his office wanting to know what the big check was. Now IMO this is bullshit because you are a customer of the bank and it shouldn't be any of their business, but hey that's the world we live in now-a-days (terrorism, drug dealing, yada, yada). Anyways, he told them that he did contract work for some web based company out of Canada (where the check said it was from) and that the company sent his payment to him in the mail. This of course was compete BS, but the banker didn't even blink, he apologized, deposited the check and sent him on his way.  TL;DR make up a BS backstory for where the check came from (i.e. I design websites, etc.), could be anything.

sportsbook,3d0z9s,mcwilly,6,Sun Jul 12 16:47:24 2015 UTC,I like Thompson by TKO.  I believe Ellenburger is still a solid fighter but this is a 5 round fight.  Ellenburger has been known to slow down as fights go on and he also has had trouble pulling the trigger.  Thompson is one of the best strikers in the entire UFC and has developed his defensive wrestling skills over the years and recently has worked with Weidman.  Ellenburger has to get this to the ground and I don't know that he can consistently.  At the weigh ins Thompson looked noticeably bigger.  Wonderboy is on the rise while Ellenburger I think has seen his best days already.  Disclaimer..Thompson is a local hero where I live and I'm a huge fan but I really do see him getting the win tonight.  Straight up odds aren't great but I think the TKO prop is worth a play.

Ellenberger while he was decent against Kos, I believe he is on a decline. I think mentally, Thompson also has an edge over Burger. I think I'll go with Thompson on this one."
sportsbook,3d0z9s,TheNarrowRoad,2,Sun Jul 12 17:02:49 2015 UTC,"Yes - it's a bit late, and I did several variations.  Blanco Hassan Graves Masvidal (plus variation with Ferreira) Ellenberger  That's my biggest odds parlay.   I also did a variation adding Waterson and switching Ellenberger with Thompson.   Also swapped Hassan with Usman as he's a big favorite, but with these big guys, anything can go.  Graves and Hassan have good odds, and Ferreira to an extent, though his weight cut and strong opponent in Masvidal makes him a tough pick."

sportsbook,3cz2x3,rs1x,14,Sun Jul 12 02:15:52 2015 UTC,"verified record  TDiBS: (1955) At Milwaukee's County Stadium, badass Cardinal outfielder Stan Musial comes to bat leading off the bottom of the 12th inning of a 5-5 All-Star deadlock. After Yankee catcher Yogi Berra complains about his feet hurting, ""The Man"" tells him, ""Don't worry, I'll have you home in a minute"", then promptly hits a game-winning home run off Frank Sullivan on the next pitch. Sick.  Didn't have much time today, but here's what I got:  ARI @ NYM  Mets struggle against K-pitchers and groundball pitchers and that's what Rubby has been thusfar this season. His ERA and FIP aren't great, and he gives up HRs at a good pace (especially to lefties). It'll be interesting to see who does well against him, but the Mets lineup has 5 lefties in it, and Granderson, Murphy and Duda can all hurt him. On the other side, Niese struggles against RHBs, which is the entire Dbags lineup. Dbags bats are hotter than the Mets' right now, and I like their split numbers better here. Taking the Dbags ML (-105).  CIN @ MIA  I actually think there is value in the Marlins ML based on Haren's splits (he matches up w the Reds lineup well), but can't bring myself to bet against Cueto. There is nothing terribly exciting about the Marlins lineup (now missing its two best players), but there is a good change that this game is a pitching duel. I like under 7 runs total.  CWS @ CHC  Arrieta. Cubs ML (-160).  OAK @ CLE  With two Cy Young Candidates on the mound, as much as I've been burned by this play in the last day or two, there is no reason not to take No Runs 1i (-160).  NYY @ BOS  I think Miley has the edge here as a southpaw against a lefty-heavy Yanks lineup. Miley has a clear deficiency against righties, just like Eovaldi has against lefties, but I like the lefties to lock this series up at home. Red Sox ML (-110).  TOR @ KCR  Wind blowing out of Kaufmann, Felix Doubront looked good against a weak White Sox team last time but will have a hard time against this potent Royals team. I think the Royals take this game easy, and I have no idea why there are even odds here. Royals ML (-105).  LAA @ SEA  Taijuan Walker is being heavily undervalued today, taking Mur'nurs ML (-112).  STL @ PIT  This Cards lineup has looked weak lately, and will struggle against Liriano as everything will probably go his way at home. Pirates ML (-170)."

sportsbook,3cz2x3,AmateurWorlock,9,Sun Jul 12 23:19:00 2015 UTC,"Anybody following me on twitter, please read this. It's a little bit important...  Ok, so I totally blew it when posting my record on twitter yesterday... I just realized I hadn't differentiated my total MLB betting record from my personal posted picks and ""3 user"" play record. My overall MLB record as of 7/12/15 at 3:54am PST is +11.37 units. You'll notice that the +19.21 unit record I posted yesterday and +11.37 unit current record don't add up with my posted bets on twitter for Saturday (should be +17.14).  I realized this was a problem so I went back and dug through all my betting records to get an accurate result of just my posted plays and ""3 user"" play results (which was pretty easy since I've been keeping a bunch of records from here). My record according to these posted picks and ""3 user"" plays is +25.42 units. I understand how this could be deceiving, but I tail some bets and make a decent amount of live bets too (apparently at a high cost with a run of bad luck the past few days) so my overall MLB betting results are completely different from my personal posted picks results. I totally fucked up yesterday and didn't think things through when I posted my record, I apologize, I'm a worthless human being. Going forward I'll be working from this +25.42 unit point on my twitter and continuing to only factor in my posted picks and ""3 user"" plays. Please don't trip because I posted +19.21 units yesterday and it'll be higher today after having a losing day. Sorry about any confusion, I completely blew it but it'll be correct going forward. Also, in order to keep things kosher, I suppose I'll have to start posting the ""3 user"" picks there as well.      Explanation of ""3 & 2 user""  Community:  3 user: 75.0% win, 38.1% ROI  2 user: 54.8% win, 2.7% ROI  Not gonna post 1 user, or cumulative total anymore. I'm still keeping records and will be looking at some data over the All Star Break to publish any interesting results of some of the more ""hidden"" trends.

sportsbook,3cz2x3,konosay,2,Sun Jul 12 21:22:32 2015 UTC,"I think there should be a sub where people can only post tips if they actually know what they're doing. No degenerates or trolls allowed to post, just the people who use sound logic in analyzing games. Sounds a little elitist as I read it, but it would probably make for a better sub. Anybody could access, only a few could post. I usually just read a few people's posts here, but when I start reading the entire thread I get nauseous. I can definitely understand how people could get flustered and start hating with all the dumbassery that gets posted, especially because you know some poor bastard loses the house here every now and again tailing something. There are a few users I haven't seen in a while that would toat ""20u on x game"", anybody not paying attention would think it's a good play. It's this shit that degrades the sub and just fuels the fire for people to lose money and spawn trolls. The whole idea here is to make money and place educated bets, not to throw out wild gambles and claim to be a god if it hits. Just my 2¢"
sportsbook,3cz2x3,-fry-,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:05:04 2015 UTC,"There'd be no sane way to keep a sub functioning like that.   ""throw out wild gambles and claim to be a god if it hits""   The biggest thing I try to do is point it out when someone makes a claim in that form.  Right now, I don't jump on it much because the baseball guys seem to be pretty quick to laugh down the ""betting my house and my dog on this tip"" guys.   ""if they actually know what they're doing""   I wouldn't go that far for the reason that it excludes people who are in process with their work. I mean, shit, I'm just now getting to a spot where I hold out some hope for my MLB work.   ""you know some poor bastard loses the house here every now and again tailing something""   Those people are inherently self-destructive. I stopped caring about them a while ago. The reality is, who or what they attach themselves to in the process of their self-destruction isn't relevant. They were going to destroy themselves no matter what.  Christ, we've had a couple consistent degens who absolutely swore they were leaving the sub 4-evah! and then they're back posting two weeks later.   ""spawn trolls""   Nothing spawns trolls.

sportsbook,3cz2x3,konosay,2,Mon Jul 13 16:05:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying people would have to be serious winners to post, just filter out the people that post bogus picks. Your system, while it's had ups and downs, is something that you've put a lot of thought and effort into. That's a valuable and thoughtful contribution that I wish there was more of. It's the mindless ""Jays are playing, bet the over"" type of bets that get circle jerked around here that really lead people astray if they don't follow the thread and know which users should be taken with a grain (or spoonful) of salt. People just see a train of ""bet this game"" or ""so and so user is always right"" and assume it's a good pick if they know nothing about the sport or don't frequent the thread. If someone comes here for the first time and makes a few picks based off the circle jerk and loses, it lowers the perceived credibility of the community as a whole.   I really like your thoughts on communal knowledge tied to the ""monkey brain"" experiment and the ""3 user"" approach, but that theory gets completely diluted when there are a bunch of monkey brained gamblers stroking each other's cocks. I think the only reason the ""3 user"" overlaps have worked so well is because the people it's tracking are people that put a lot of thought into their picks (outside of FishFade). I don't have the data to support this, but I'd be willing to bet that if that theory were extrapolated to the thread as a whole, it'd be barely breaking even at best. But whatever, it is what it is. I'll just keep ignoring 80% of the posts here and hope the people with a gambling sickness find help."
sportsbook,3cz2x3,-fry-,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:11:15 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, but I just don't see that you could maintain a viable sub that way.  One, people like to participate.  Two, honestly, /r/sportsbook has done a better job than most subs of surviving its own growth. Look at something like /r/WritingPrompts for an example of a sub that collapsed into severe retardation under the weight of its own popularity.  The biggest thing I try to do is nurse along the people who show potential and drive off the complete jackoffs. I do that more during football, but that's mostly because football attracts a lot more jackoffs to the sub.  The trolls are gonna happen. The guys who are committed to a system until it fails and then fade away are gonna happen. The guys tailing whatever is hot are gonna happen.  There aren't a ton of people in it for the long haul, and I think it's pretty safe to say that you can identify the long haul guys.  I'd also add that the dumber people in this sub do provide a pretty fast intro for noobs to the way the gambling world works. Is it a bad thing for noobs to learn about the follies of degens?"

However, I suppose you're right in that it would suffer greatly in followers if people weren't allowed to be as interactive. For the record, I think people should be allowed to comment for discussion, but still keep the ""tip"" posting restricted.   Anyway... NFL... Man, don't get me started on that shit show of a thread. I'll never post there because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, but that place can be awful in terms of horrible bandwagon plays and circle jerks. I follow football like a crack head following their dealer at 3am, but I don't have any idea on how to handicap a game so I'd never post a pick. Comparing MLB to NFL, we have something amazing going, so I guess I should just be happy for that. BTW, I did pretty well on the games I tailed you on last season (even better on the college bowl games), so I hope to pick your brain a bit one of these days as I move on to other sports and expand my resume. I'd like to start betting football more, but it's hard to bet games when I haven't drawn the conclusions myself.

sportsbook,3cz2x3,BR2015,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:47:34 2015 UTC,"Ah, yes... This is a good sheet for bet tracking. Rounding errors will cause your actual bankroll to differ from your tracked bankroll, but it's pretty close. Also, you have to be meticulous with it. If you forget to enter a bet, you can't go back and add a row for that bet, you have to manually move each bet down. The one thing that really irritates me is that it logs bets based on posted dates, not on completed dates. So if you make a season long bet, your graph will get all fucked up because it will track for the date you posted the bet. All-in-all, it's very well done, but could be improved upon."

sportsbook,3cz62y,fellbot,9,Mon Jul 13 04:02:42 2015 UTC,Best bet  Norway First division kick off 14:30  Staebak vs Sarpsborg. Staebak - 1 Ah @ 2.000  I have talked about Staebak before and the brilliant run they have been on this season. However it all went a bit wrong for them last week. Losing 4-1 to Start and in return damaging their chances of a league title. However they didn't lose much ground and will want to get back on track here with a win.   They are coached by Bob Bradley who used to manage he national side of USA. He has made Staebak a resolute unit who are hard to beat. They should definitely win this one and hopefully it's enough to secure a pay out from the handicap. You can take the Staebak straight win at 1.53 but I didn't like the odds.   This is the only bet I like today. Another couple caught my eye but I may go small on them on my own. Didn't want to post rubbish picks here just to clog it up. Good luck all
sportsbook,3cz62y,andtheyreoff,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:36:22 2015 UTC,"You only talked about one side--Staebak. To accurately predict the outcome of a match you need to know what the situation is on both sides. If not, its a coin flip. Judging by your last prediction it seems you depend solely on luck. Therefore these picks are garbage."

Gravity currently looks like the strongest team in NA. At 1.25, I believe there is still value here.  With Keane offering amazing flexibility in the mid lane, Gravity looks to be clicking with new jungler Move.  Altec and Bunny are currently the strongest bot lane in NA as well with Piglet/Wildturtle struggling lately.  Gravity has an advantage in every position. I think if you put a more recognizable name on Gravity such as TSM or CLG or Cloud 9 with Gravity's performance and this is easily a 1.1 or lower odds game.   8 units Gravity       Cloud 9 2.34 over Dignitas 1.55 - Cloud 9 blue side/Dig fan vote.  Tough one here.  Cloud 9 looked decent against Gravity yesterday while Dignitas looked lost against Impulse's agression.  I loved Dignitas yesterday as they have played decent all split but they have somewhat crumbled over the last three weeks.  Due to this tilt and Cloud 9's decent showing yesterday, I believe this game is right around 50/50.  It is hard to put Dignitas at a huge favorite, therefore we have value on Cloud 9.  3 units Cloud 9       Team Solo Mid 1.95 over Liquid 1.95 - TSM blue side/fan vote.  I actually love TSM here at even money.  Even with Wildturtle's poor play, they've managed to stay even with Liquid this split.  TSM won their last meeting when they were heavier favorites at 1.7.  Due to their loss yesterday and ADC unknowns, the line is now close to even.  Logic tells us that we need to go with TSM here as nothing has changed since their last meeting except for perception of teams.  If anything, Liquid has looked worse recently than they did at their last meeting.  4 units TSM       Team 8 2.77 over Team Impulse 1.4 - Impulse blue side/fan vote.  Impulse is just too inconsistent to take here at 1.4  I put this game at 60/40 in favor of Impulse as it really does not matter who their opponent is, they have the ability to throw at any time.  I'll be skipping this one but I would lean Team 8 with the value.  Keep out of parlays.  skip       CLG 1.37 over Team Dragon Knights 2.98 - CLG blue side/fan vote.  Even with CLG's end of season slide, TDK is a team they can and should beat.  This strikes me as the type of game that CLG has an easy time preparing for.  The pick/ban is not going to dictate this game and TDK does not have the ability to beat CLG in pick/ban.  CLG will get comfort champs and slowly whittle away at TDK. 4 units CLG      https://twitter.com/esportsbettor     http://www.cappertek.com/picks.asp?shs=ESportsBettor.cappertek.com&lastDays=180&sport=ALL#history   115-99  +68 units, 9% ROI     Join us at /r/esportsbook and /r/sportsbook     stander414 on KiK if anyone wants to chat esports"

sportsbook,3cynr3,fellbot,2,Sun Jul 12 08:48:07 2015 UTC,"Vulcun-NA LCS W7D2  Apologies for the missed day, I was actually at a League of Legends tournament myself and wasn't able to get wifi at the convention center I was at.  I learned that I am still not LCS material.  Here is NA LCS W7D2 lineup.        Lineup:  Top-Zionspartan  Jungle-Xmithie  Mid-Pobelter/Keane(SC)  ADC-Sneaky  Support-Lemonnation  Flex-Rush  Flex-Impact  Flex-Hauntzer     Explanation It's probably good I missed a day because stats would've said go TSM and clearly they're not dealing with the roster waffling as well as they hoped.  That being said I still think betting against T8 is a good idea.  TiP looked super strong yesterday and T8 will always be T8 which means they'll fight and TiP is going to be happy to go head to head with them.  I think TiP is the more talented team and will get major points against them.  Impact and Rush are the under valued players on TiP so that's who I'm going with.  Apollo and Adrian are high projections but also high cost.  I really wanted to go heavier on GRV going against NME but couldn't seem to make the salary work out without taking players from a team that was extremely risky.  Hauntzer was my one GRV player as he is still relatively cheap for how consistent he has been and how bad Flaresz played yesterday.  NME gives up the second most pts to top laners in the LCS and Hauntzer has proven that he is capable of taking an advantage and carrying.  Now Pobelter and Keane are very close in salary but NME(ignoring the last three weeks) has been incredibly good at keeping mid laners down.  My gut says Keane because GRV just looks more consistent but if NME's stats move back towards the mean then Keane will have a relatively mediocre game and Pobelter would be the better choice.  Choose whichever mid your heart desires and whichever you choose, make them SC.  CLG going up against TDK will hopefully be a good team to get fpts from.  CLG looked better today and TDK looked iffy against TL.  I think CLG has the same amount of talent as TL and if they play well CLG shouldn't have an issue beating TDK.  Zion and Xmithie are both reasonably priced and will allow you to have enough cap space to get decent players elsewhere.  Finding cheap players in good matchups was almost impossible today.  Mostly one sided games stats wise and very lopsided salaries.  I chose C9 as my cheap players team because Dignitas has looked a little more middle of the packish recently and C9 actually performed quite well against GRV who is currently the best team in NA.  That being said I'm hoping C9 can at least hold their own against DIG and Sneaky will be the one to lead the charge with Lemonnations ginger beard raking in assists.  GL to all those who continue to follow these lineups and I encourage you to message me on reddit or KiK if you would like access to the stats so you can interpret them for yourself.     Top 5 Projected Scorers  -Adrian  -Apollo  -XWX  -Pobelter  -Altec  Top 5 Value Players  -Adrian  -Xmithie  -Zion  -Rush  -Impact        Thanks for reading and play safe this week, 50/50s and Double Ups all day.

sportsbook,3cwd1k,SaintNickPR,2,Sat Jul 11 09:33:47 2015 UTC,"not saying Joker wont win but saying he will roll is probably wishful thinking. Last year Federer was playing worse and Djokovic was playing better and it still went to a 5 setter where Joker was able to win the crucial points.  Watching most of Joker and Fed's matches this Wimbledon I will say that Joker is committing more UE's than I've seen and his serve has been average (compared to what Im used to) while Federer has been playing remarkable on his favorite surface. That being said, Djokovic is in his prime and his aggressive style of play can neutralize Federer. If I can get Federer above +150 I would take a gamble but at these odds I only see value in Djokovic which is very shady to me."
sportsbook,3cwd1k,laihs8,2,Sat Jul 11 10:23:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure djoko was playing better last year...yeah he faltered against Anderson who has a huge serve but he's been pretty dominant thus far....not gonna lie though I thought the final was gonna be Murray vs Djokovic, but regardless -126 is a really nice line for joker"
sportsbook,3cwd1k,krxkrx,2,Sat Jul 11 10:37:46 2015 UTC,"The score lines really aren't indicative of how well Djoker's been playing. I think he's been playing wayyy under his potential and has struggled in imposing his will early in points and exploiting the open court. Roger has easily been playing the best tennis in the tournament, and it's not even close. All that being said however, I expect Djoker to step up in the final and give us an insanely good match. A match good enough that I'm just gonna watch and enjoy it.. I don't think a bet on either man is particularly good."
sportsbook,3cwd1k,laihs8,2,Sat Jul 11 23:02:13 2015 UTC,"exactly my feelings. Yes, Djoker right now is better than Fed but has not been playing his best. He won in straight sets against gasquet but you could see chinks in the armour that Fed will be able to exploit more than Gascan"
sportsbook,3cwd1k,CreateUrReality,2,Sun Jul 12 04:07:20 2015 UTC,"I think this is Feds year. Serving is on point. Also, he is less distracted and more focused on cementing his legacy.  Sort of like when Agasi had those late runs at the end of his career."
sportsbook,3cwd1k,bumbleb333,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:30:50 2015 UTC,His serving last year against djokovic was on point as well. over 70% first serves in and 29 aces. Only way he made it go to 5 sets.  it's stupid to involve mentality when it comes to this match. sure federer wants it badly but so does djokovic. if anything djokovic's fumble at french open last month will make him even more hungry for this title
sportsbook,3cwd1k,ChipmunkHopper,2,Sun Jul 12 09:52:12 2015 UTC,"I think Djokovic should be favored even more.  Before the semifinals even started Djokovic was favored to win Wimbledon at -150 odds, yet his odds got WORSE for making it into the final???   Were the oddsmakers assuming he'd face weak-minded Murray?  Is the minor shoulder injury chipping into the odds?  Whatever, I plan on betting $2000.00 on Djokovic."

Furthermore, I don't mind losing $2000.00 if it means Federer wins.  It's a win-win situation since I don't like Djokovic.  I just think he'll win easily."

If you're laying that kind of change just put it in +2.5 sets, both of these guys are all but guaranteed to take at least a set."

sportsbook,3cwd1k,laihs8,2,Sat Jul 11 12:17:40 2015 UTC,i agree with you on his value is higher than what the line was set at  i put a mayweather sized bet on him after a lot of research and calculation and simulations  i almost fell for feddy after seeing him destroy murray but i realized murray played like absolute trash and novak has a way better chance to win and todays match showed the skill gap like maria vs serena
sportsbook,3cwd1k,phatey,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:55:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure where you got the -200 from. A -200 line would indicate that Joker's implied probability to win is 67% which does not seem in line based on both player's current form, H2H, and historical track record at Wimbeldon."
sportsbook,3cwd1k,rollyp,2,Sun Jul 12 11:06:30 2015 UTC,The way I bet is I set my own line based off of the way I see it and if I get perceived value I take it. Been doing it that way a long time. Good luck whatever side you take

sportsbook,3cwd1k,mediocredolphin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:27:07 2015 UTC,I really like the 3-1 prop at +300. If Fed wins its unlikely it will be in straight sets and naturally a five setter would favor Joker's younger legs so hoping its a 3-1 Fed victory.
sportsbook,3cwd1k,laihs8,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:04:33 2015 UTC,"I'm planning on betting on Federer, think with the roof closed his serve will be a huge advantage and will have the crowd support echoing around his every point. He's been outstanding so far and Djokovic has been below his best but having said that Djokovic could get it all to click this game like we know he can. The odds for Federer are $2.05 on my bookie, I was hoping for closer to $2.40+ Will there be late money for Djokovic to improve the odds for Federer? Or should I just take these odds now?"
sportsbook,3cwd1k,mediocredolphin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:15:02 2015 UTC,"i like federer as well but not sure roof being closed as big as a advantage as you are making it out to be. Yes, federer is one of the best indoor court players but Djokovic is no slouch either.   Slower courts/lower bounce would slightly favor Federer (especially his slice) but not to where it creates a ""huge"" advantage on a player of Djokovics caliber."
sportsbook,3cwd1k,laihs8,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:03:27 2015 UTC,"My main question was about the odds, but I should have worded the whole thing better. I think Federer's serve will be a big advantage, the closing of the roof will accentuate this advantage of the serve and also allow him to play without the sun on him which can drain him playing at a fast pace after a full tournament. In 2012 at Wimbledon he played under the roof and was outstanding. I think it will be a very close match which is why I feel all these little variables are more important than normal."

This happens to me everytime... Always that last game. I lost it all because of TSM and its games like this that make me think esports are still questionable as to whether or games are rigged... Im in debt now so thanks TSM for not protecting Dragon. Im so sorry to those who tailed ive been burned by esports in the past and i thought today would be different. Although I went 3/4 on my picks I am sad to say this will be the first and last time I will be posting picks... Again -500 was rediculous, this is just outright stupid. League of Legends NA LCS W7D1   TL (-250) vs TDK - Liquid have been improving these past few weeks going 2-0 last week one of those being against Dignitas while TDK is still struggling to find wins although they are developing team chemistry with their new additions, I believe Liquid's chemistry and current improvement should outweigh TDK's. I will be in disbelief if Liquid throws this... (W) CLG (-300) vs Enemy - Man oh man, what a past 2 weeks its been for CLG, going 0-4 now, mind you those past 4 were against Impulse, Liquid, TSM, and Gravity, not exactly the easiest competition... Enemy has better record in the past 2 weeks but its only 1/4 with a win over TDK. I believe CLG have been practicing very hard this past week, aiming to improve their record and going against Enemy should be a good chance at turning things around. A new week, a new team, a new time to start the comeback... Let's hope this is the end of the losing streak. (W) Gravity (-350) vs C9 - I dont know if it's C9 fans or if people who actually believe C9 can pull the upset here but the fan vote is about 70% to 30% for Gravity, i feel like this should be more 85% to 15% for Gravity. Gravity has been on a tear adding a win over TSM to their name just last week, thats VERY impressive and a huge reason why i feel Gravity will be able to overcome a recuperating C9, still trying to find a way to get a win taking losses from T8 and TL last week. Gravity want to prove themselves, and their stats are showing. C9 wants a win badly but it will be tough going against the newly #1 Team that probably really enjoys being there right now. (W) T8 vs TSM (-500) - I cannot believe my book has this for -500... They really dont like us making money. TSM tied for #1 that would like to stay #1 as well, they have a recent win over T8, they will most likely add another. I think they'll be more disappointed in themselves than we would be if they throw this. (L) TiP vs DIG (SKIP) - I dont think it gets much closer than this, this week. Two very hungry teams with various players that could make a huge impact... Gamsu and Dignitas have been very impressive other than that TDK upset... they've kind of cooled of these past few weeks and I would really like to see Azingy make an appearance again but Helios hasnt really hindered Dignitas. I believe it was during EU LCS that I heard them mention XiaoWeiXiao is very confident about this specific game though and feels like TiP can get the win which makes me nervous just to how much TiP have been prepping for this match. Dignitas beat them Week 4 though, Gamsu going 11-0-10 that game! What does TiP have up their sleeve? Or could this be another game where Gamsu shows shades of an MVP? I honestly have no idea other than it should be very exciting.   Suggested Bets   Safe Parlay - Gravity/TSM (-184) (L) or Liquid/TSM (-125) L  Risky Parlay - Liquid/CLG/Gravity/TSM (+188) (L)  Let's hope for the best and bigger bank rolls! And tail at your own risk of course!"

I kind of like TDK over Liquid. Liquid is a team that can crumble quick and with Fenix's poor play and Piglet's selfish play in a non adc meta are huge vulnerabilities for Liquid. I'd skip or go TDK.  Heavy on Gravity over C9.  Skip or Enemy over CLG   TSM but skip because of odds  Heavy on Dignitas

Effectively you have wagered $200 on Djokovic to win $300.  To hedge this, you can bet $250 on Federer at even money, and you'll be up $50 regardless of the result.  If you think Djokovic will win, I'd recommend a $200 bet on Federer.  That way you net $100 if you're right, and lose nothing if you're wrong."

His serve is the best it's ever been. Murray is arguable the 2nd best returner in men's tennis today, behind Novak, and he could not even come close to figuring out Fed's serve earlier yesterday. Roger is in vintage form right now, he's moving well and his net play has been outstanding. I really think he wins Sunday. If I'm in your shoes I pound Fed ML, but that's just me.

All these characters are shown appearing in 8 episodes on IMDB, and I'd be hella surprised given Pizzolatto's writing style if he actually killed off any of these characters. A few episodes in and they all have decent story lines going for them and as ""weak"" as the show is at times, the only reason it's as good as it is is because of the different flavors that each one of the main characters brings. If something were to happen to one of them, it would be in the last episode, and my guess would be any of them except Rachel McAdams."

After the third episode, I'll say I'm comfortable with the fact that they're really fucking with the audience this season in a way that wasn't present in the first one.  Through the first two episodes of S2, there was a real concern about whether they were being cheeky and leveraging the traditional SoCal noire story or if they were just flat-out writing a shit season of TV.  Third episode solved that part of the mystery. Right now it's on the right side of self-parody.  All that said, I don't give a shit what happens to any of these characters. That's the big difference between the two seasons."
sportsbook,3ctim3,konosay,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:44:28 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it is less rewarding so far, but still worth watching. The first one had an aura of dread and unease about it that is just impossible to recreate. If they went that same route, everyone would just be saying how it's too similar to the first season. So it is reasonably different and does a good job showing another seedy underbelly- California this time rather than the deep south. There are great visuals still, and intriguing characters, and great one liners along with confusing dialogue that you need to see written out to parse together. So yeah, if you liked the first season you should at least enjoy this one. Let's also remember that the first season took a few episodes to really find it's legs, if I remember correctly it was episode 4 last season with that insane 6 minute shot that really made everyone start losing their minds about this show. It's a complicated story that rolls slow and picks up speed. On the other hand, the friend I watch it with is distractable and sleepy- let's just say this is not the show for him. More like nap time and then ask me what the fuck is going on."

I also recommend doing your own research before blindly following these picks, some of which I won't even bet come fight night.    Garbrandt/Almeida parlay -355  Neither one of these guys are going to lose. Both of them are primed to be the future of the 135 division and will be given protected fights until they start facing the top 5 of the division.  Chad Mendes +155  You'd be crazy to not take these lines. I think I'll be doing a combo of Mendes ML, Mendes decision and Conor 1st/2nd RD win.   Gunni Nelson Finish  Odds aren't out on this yet, but Nelson by submission seems very likely. Thatch has been super protected but was picked apart by Bendo. Nelson's only loss came to a top 10 WW.   I don't think Thatch can stop Nelson on the ground if he gets him down.  Nelson/Thatch No Decision  Thatch will win by TKO or Nelson will win by Sub.  Jeremy Stephens +170  This is one of the only underdogs I like outside of title fights. I will be researching this one a lot more before 189, but I'm leaning Stephens in this fight.  Stephens is a tough, experienced fighter who has a ton of tough losses on his resume. (Pettis, Cerrone, Swanson, Oliviera, J-Lau, Tibau, Guillard).  Bermudez's only notable wins are over 2014 Guida and 2013 Holloway, neither ones at the prime of their career (Guida is slowing down and Holloway has really, really improved since his losing streak to Bermudez/Conor.)  Cathal Pendred via Decision  Just because fuck everybody right? This guy is going to 3 round decision his way to the title."
sportsbook,3crnm6,krxkrx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:46:37 2015 UTC,"I honestly thought Garbrandt looked mediocre against Marcus Brimage who, in my opinion, is a pretty awful fighter in his own right. Cody had him badly hurt early on but was unable to enact any sort of killer instinct and it is debatable that was losing the remainder of the fight until the TKO. That being said, I do think that Garbrandt will come out on top but the odds don't justify placing any bets on him. In all honestly there's value in Briones here; he could control the fight with his wrestling and take a decision. I'd say he has about a 35% chance of doing so."
sportsbook,3crnm6,krxkrx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:52:53 2015 UTC,"Also, I think Bermudez should be able to control his fight against Stephens, although he has a tendency to take unnecessary strikes in stand-up exchanges while ahead. If you think Stephens will be able to capitalize enough on that to KO or eek out a decision (which would be extremely close), then by all means place a bet. On this one I would stay away; I think the bookies have a very fair line here."

He trains with Team Alpha Male, possibly one of the best camps in the country in terms of wrestling, striking, cardio and having guys ready on fight night. Getting to train with Faber, Dillashaw, Benavidez doesn't hurt either.  Briones has never really faced a good fighter. Bobby Green in 2008 maybe? I just watched his fight with Cannetti, this guy is nothing more than a can to feed Garbrandt. Cannetti had Briones rocked at least half a dozen times and took him down twice. Cannetti was rushing in Briones with his hands down and it took Briones a round and a half to finally catch him with an uppercut. Briones was getting demolished the entire 7 minutes before that. The only chance Briones has is catching Garbrandt in a submission off his back.  I'm really, really interested to know why you think Briones can control a guy who could have went to a D1 school for wrestling, that trains with a lightweight, wrestling based camp.  Garbrandt will keep his distance and pick Briones apart with superior boxing and angles, regardless of whether he has ""killer instinct."""

So many people were saying Pacman would come in and beat Mayweather, but the line dropped from -200 to I think -250 with a day to go. Sure, the public may have been on Pacman, but the money had to be on Mayweather.   If the public is heavy on Mendes, and the line is improving for Conor, then heavy money is on him. For the future, this is a pretty good money making opportunity. The public were going to be on Mendes (at least, according to what you have seen), yet the line drops on McGregor. I jumped in for McGregor at the line around -180, it's now around -200 in my book, so hedge out for money."

There's obviously a good amount of sharp money coming in on McGregor.  The second problem, as I mentioned earlier, is that judging by these forums, the public is certainly on Mendes."

Did he win? sure what is maybe a square bet? probably.   everybody loved pacman and as the fight got closer the public was all over pacquoi and moved the line closer. sharps hammered mayweather.  Either way good luck to you sir. you cannot argue that there is no value on the mendes line at +170"
sportsbook,3crnm6,NeverDwell,3,Sat Jul 11 18:49:35 2015 UTC,"Chad Mendes +165 (2U): Expecting him to grind Connor down with wrestling and against the fence and the fight to go to a decision.  Rory Macdonald -165 (1U): Think he has what it takes to win this time around and has improved greatly. A finish by sub late would not surprise me.  Brandon Thatch -172 (1.5U): Concerns about his Take down defense and his submission loss to Bendo, with him gassing in the 4th. This is only a 3 round fight and I think Thatch has the size and strength to avoid take downs while picking Nelson apart. Nelson took way too many shots from a guy like Rick Story to make me feel confident in his striking defense against Thatch  Tim Means +174 (1U): A potential FOTN and a toss up for me. Have not liked how Brown has looked his past few fights (against great competition though) and see Means as consistently improving. This is a value pick and a pick based on style. I think the less exciting it is, the more it favors Means.  Cathal Pendred -105 (1U): Howard has lost 3 in a row and has entered ""just happy to be here territory. I dont think Pendred is great, but he is a Grinder and Howard tends to wilt against those types. Do have concerns about Pendred eating shots, especially with the power Howard possess.  Louis Smolka -110 (1U): Younger, better, faster is the play here. I didn't think Seery looked great his last fight, thought that win was more of a case of his opponent gassing terribly in the third round.  Mendes/Macgregor OVER 2.5 -102 (2U)  Almeida/Pickett OVER 1.5 -152 (1U)  Garbrandt/Briones OVER 1.5 +100 (2U)"

I thought this was a huge boost for Mendez but now I'm not so sure for two reasons: 1. Chael Sonnen likes mcgregor and his antics (I think they are friends) but he purposely informs the media of his huge weight cut and even gets the numbers mixed up because he reported two different weights. 2. McGregor posted a picture of himself looking gaunt and exhausted from cutting weight. Why would he want Mendez to see how bad the cut is going for him? I'm thinking he's deliberately giving the media this account of weakness in order to make Mendez underestimate McGregor and get caught with a knockout instead of being the methodical fighter that he is. I'm thinking this is another one of his mind games and by the looks of the internet threads, it seems to have worked on this community. With that said, I betted on Mendez to get the win."

sportsbook,3crnm6,WinchestersFinest,3,Sun Jul 12 03:33:20 2015 UTC,Chad mendes... The line is wrong.
sportsbook,3crnm6,DarkSquareBishop,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:19:47 2015 UTC,I took the over 2.5 rounds in the McGregor/Mendes fight @ +110.  I think it goes to the later rounds.  I favor McGregor but can't bet on him at the current odds.  I like Means for an underdog play and also the over 2.5.  Both guys are very durable and I see this as a coin flip.  I'm also on the under 1.5 for Pickett/Almeida and Garbrandt/Briones. Also like Garbrandt ITD and have a few units on that  Small flyer bets on Gunnar by sub as well as dog bets on Pickett (the line is getting crazy) and Swick.
sportsbook,3crnm6,BurtDickinson,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:20:10 2015 UTC,"Why is everyone so sure Mendes is going to win? Everyone seems really confident that the heavy underdog is going to win. I'm definitely not a Mcgregor fan. I was of the opinion that Aldo was going to destroy him. But I just don't see Mendes's edge here. Mendes will try to take him down, but Mcgregor has exceptional balance, and I think Mendes will have a more difficult time getting a takedown than people think. Can someone please educate this filthy casual? Much appreciated!"
sportsbook,3crnm6,krxkrx,2,Fri Jul 10 17:52:07 2015 UTC,"The line is just not normal for the situation. Mendes is sitting at +170 which is a good play if you think he has a 37.03% chance of winning or better. He is an elite wrestler, a knockout artist and a thoroughly vetted contender. McGregor is only one of those things."
sportsbook,3crnm6,bphone13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:23:58 2015 UTC,"It's more of the threat of the takedown than anything. In Conor's previous fights, he could reasonably assume that his opponents would keep the fight standing due to their poor-to-average wrestling. I think the biggest aspect of Mendes' takedown abilities is that it will open up his striking. There is a very good chance that Conor gets hit much more in this fight than in his previous fights against prototypical strikers."
sportsbook,3crnm6,Kamoner,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:14:47 2015 UTC,"I really love Conor, I wish he wins because if he does, he will keep entertaining me for years to come.  However, after watching the recents fights of the two... Conor has really good standup techniques and has a large arsenal of kicks (that rarely to do damage for now). He has long range and keeps fights at a distance. However, a ''weak'' opponent like Siva made him fall 3-4 times. Against Mendes, he will probably have issues keeping it a stand-up fight.  After watching the Aldo vs Mendes 2 fight, they really seem to be on a while other speed level. I honestly don't know if Conor can keep up with this level of quickness... we haven't seem him do it so far. If the line had been like -110 for both, I would have bet on Conor just to put even more hype on the win. But in reality, this fight really is a toss up... whoever connects a good one first and does damage will probably end up winning... so not taking a shot at +170 Mendes is nuts.  I'm not sure Mendes will win, but IMO he has like 55% win chance... at +170, I'm taking that."

sportsbook,3cqo9t,mackie011,6,Fri Jul 10 23:31:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I always thought it was a sucker bet. I had described it as ""poison"" because of how fast it does damage and how juiced it is, and the element of luck involved plus the way that wins will make a bettor think irrationally. That was earlier this season, before Cheese started his system.   I'm not so sure now that we've seen such sustained and impressive success in this thread that it's as bad of a bet as I used to believe. It really can destroy your bankroll in the blink of an eye, though, especially if you bet to win the unit size instead of a base of the unit size. On one hand, Cheese has had too good of a run for it to be dumb luck, and he researches these picks damn well, but on the other hand there were exceedingly few runs scored in the first from mid June to now, compared to May and early June where runs in the 1st were more common than not.

With today, it was only a 1.2u loss , I used a free bet promo on my ARI play, and didn't touch the PHI play.  I win less, but I also lose less, and my aim isn't to win a lot of money from these, since that is a sure fire way to get your account limited. If the profits > loss, then I'm not too fussed."

sportsbook,3cqo9t,CheeseAddiction,2,Fri Jul 10 17:09:44 2015 UTC,Aren't day games slower hitting wise? Or is it the match ups that are concerning?
sportsbook,3cqo9t,waxxo,2,Fri Jul 10 17:49:32 2015 UTC,"Generally, but that mainly has to do with clear, sunny skies, and it's cloudy in Chicago today, which could counteract that. Also my book's website is down right (fuck sportsbook.ag) now so I couldn't bet on it even if I wanted to."

sportsbook,3cqo9t,droosong,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:12:34 2015 UTC,Went with my gut last second and took it for a unit. Nice!
sportsbook,3cqo9t,hendrixfools,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:18:57 2015 UTC,"Curious why you took NYY/BOS.  Buchholz has given up 13 runs in 17 IP in the 1st so far. He's got a 5.83 career ERA at Yankees Stadium. BvP has current Yankees hitting .307/.347/.489 off him.  Also, Yankees are still the top 1st inning scoring team right? I just don't have a good feeling about that one."
sportsbook,3cqo9t,nms9807,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:48:25 2015 UTC,"He has been getting progressively nastier this year, just came off tossing a CG, and lefties are only hitting .236 off him this year. He hasn't allowed more than 1ER in his last 4 starts. He got hit hard twice in April (Yanks, Blue Jays), so those 2 outings skewed his 1st inning numbers. While I'm a Yankees fan and want to see them light him up tonight, I think he'll come out strong. Same with Pineda."
sportsbook,3cqo9t,CheeseAddiction,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:55:52 2015 UTC,would you guys think that if the games that are worth betting no 1st run scores would also be a good bet for the under first 5 innings bet?

But it seems like he takes a little to settle in and I can remember him getting hit in several first innings this year. I don't have numbers to back it up, just going off of memory, but I would be a little wary of taking the prop on this game."

I've been betting lots of overs lately and I've noticed that it's very common for games to have split decisions, where a first half over is blown because the last 4 innings are just a flood of merciless zeroes, or a slow starting game recovers and hits its over because of a late scoring rally. Definitely seems like some teams such as Minnesota tend to recover the overs while others like Oakland and the LADs tend to fly over the first half total and then just die and come in a run under the full game."

sportsbook,3crcm8,VanJK87,2,Fri Jul 10 06:22:53 2015 UTC,"I've had Gasquet upsetting both Kyrgios and Wawrinka so far.. But I just don't see him taking a set tomorrow. Anderson gave him a run for his money, but Gasquet can't challenge Novak with his serve like Anderson.  Djokovic is just on another level right now.  Edit: I would also say Gasquet got kinda lucky that Kyrgios turned into a crybaby and basically quit. Also Wawrinka is a very mediocre grass player, which Novak is not."
sportsbook,3crcm8,nms9807,2,Fri Jul 10 06:59:19 2015 UTC,"I think Federer will win as well, but am not entirely confident. Thinking about going over 21.5 (-115) games won for Federer. Any thoughts?  I assume Fed will take at least one set, and if he loses 7-5, 6-4, 6-4 the other sets then thats 19 games won. And that's if he loses 3-1. Kinda writing outloud. I think there's a good chance he wins 22 games.   Any feedback/input about this prop?   edit: I bet it. Federer Over 21.5 Games Won (-115) LOSS"

Going over the scenarios for o21.5 in my head I think both outcomes are about equally as likely. I like both bets though.   Fed did beat him 6-0 , 6-1 the last time they faced, and to be honest I think Fed is in better form than AM at the moment."
sportsbook,3crcm8,krxkrx,2,Fri Jul 10 04:53:01 2015 UTC,How likely do you think RF will be able to win -2.5 sets? my book has it at +480 and it looks very tasty
sportsbook,3crcm8,CaptainRogi,2,Fri Jul 10 07:14:55 2015 UTC,"I'd say somewhere between 15-20%. I think that if Roger wins it will be 3-0 or 3-1. If he dominates early I don't see Andy making the necessary adjustments. That being said, there is a very reasonable chance that Murray wins this match, but I think he needs the first 2 sets to pull it off."

sportsbook,3crcm8,laihs8,2,Fri Jul 10 17:25:59 2015 UTC,If you think Murray will win then put Murray to win first set + match. Odds for this are currently 2.37 on b365 as opposed to 1.8 for a straight win.  Murray tends to be a strong starter and an early lead will be essential if he plans to beat Federer as Murray is prone to mid game inconsistency.  EDIT: spelling
sportsbook,3crcm8,LVIC,2,Fri Jul 10 14:25:40 2015 UTC,"I like Federer here. He's played great. Murray has been good but dropped some ugly sets this tourney. Kind of surprised Murray Federer is the dog. He is the King of Wimbledon, after all."

Another issue is that these places trust the books to give them this information and they just pass it along.  They really have no other choice, since they would have no way of verifying it.

I think Gambit has great value over Giants tonight! I picked it up last night @1.72 and it's already down to 1.68 right now. For me, yesterdays matches speak for themselves: Gambit destroyed SK, while Giants got wrecked by Origen. To be fair, SK is in a really bad form right now, while Origen is in a pretty good form. But still, the communication of Giants was terrible and I have to admit (like someone said last week); they are actually pretty bad and all they can hope for is their midlaner to get fed. Gambit on the other hand, had a bad start of the season, but are now finding each other and are playing way better!"

sportsbook,3cr23a,stander414,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:34:28 2015 UTC,"For today's EU LCS    Gambit Gaming beats Giants @1.73 (Result: Loss)    Gambit Gaming (6-7) are on the rise and improving week by week with the most convincing win of the day yesterday, whilst Giants (6-7) are faltering. Giants are generally a team that starts off quite sharply but drops off towards the middle & end of the split, and whilst this Giants squad is much improved, I think you'll see the same thing happen again as we enter the last few weeks of the LCS.   I suggest placing a medium stake on this.    SK Gaming beats Copenhagen Wolves @1.40 (Result: Win)    Copenhagen Wolves' (2-11) new roster is still trying to find its footing, and have yet to win a game since replacing their top, support and jungler. The inexperience of their top and support showed quite clearly in yesterdays match, as they made some fairly huge mistakes. While I think SK Gaming (3-10) is a decidedly average team, they should be able to capitalize on those kinds of mistakes.  I suggest placing a small stake on this.    Fnatic beats Origen @1.37 (Result: Win)    Fnatic (13-0) remain the unbeaten kings of the west and are now tied for the all-time longest winstreak in LCS history, and I expect them to break that record today. While Origen (10-3)  is one of the top teams in the LCS, they were beaten convincingly the last time these two sides met. With yesterday's game showing Fnatic coming back from a 5k@20 deficit against fellow top team H2k, it's hard to bet against Fnatic. Origen relies on winning to early game to accrue a lead and teamfighting, but Fnatic have shown several times that they will come back if they are put behind, and they have simply outclass Origen at their own strongpoint when it comes to teamfighting, as they are by far the best in the west.  I suggest placing a medium stake on this.    I think a double with Gambit & Fnatic wins @2.30 is a great bet.    LCS Betting Record: 34 wins 11 losses"

The only problem with Serena is that she starts off slow. If she wins Set 1, sayonara.

With this form no way she could even make it to a tiebreak like in Australian Open, let alone to win a set.  As for the other semi final match, I think Muguruza will win. Even though Radwanska has been playing her best tennis in here, she is still vulnerable to quality big hitter. Radwanska got past Madison Keys because she made tons of unforced errors at important points. Muguruza won't be as generous unless she succumbs to the pressure."

Sidenote: Is it possible that this discrepancy could work in a punter's advantage, seeing as while one line goes higher the other get's lower... I wonder if Bovoda considers if for example the punter bets overs more often than unders and therefore makes the over lines worse. I think it's interesting, albeit sucky."

sportsbook,3cm36p,madsports66,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:02:46 2015 UTC,Game could be very similar to yesterday. Doubt the Phillies do much against Greinke (who is silently putting together the best pitching season of his career). I'd move to say that Greinke looks more dialed in than any other pitcher this season. His shit is spine-tinglingly good.
sportsbook,3cm36p,j3rown,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:16:43 2015 UTC,yeah im thinking it'll be similar to last night except phillies dont have a good pitcher on the mound tonight. i just went with -1.5 LAA i think its pretty safe.
sportsbook,3cm36p,SaintNickPR,11,Thu Jul 9 23:24:27 2015 UTC,"verified record  This Day in Beisbol History: (1971) Eesh, this must've been painful to watch. In the longest shutout in American League history, the A's beat the Angels, 1-0 in a 20-inning game. Oakland's Vida Blue fans 17 batters in the first eleven innings.  Picks coming shortly. Boobs.  OAK @ NYY  So Oakland's bats have been a bit hotter than the Yanks stat-wise over the past 6 games or so, but I look for fortunes to change today. Chavez is a pretty well-rounded pitcher for the most part, but has a clear deficiency against left-handed bats. To no one's surprise, there is only one right-handed bat in the Yanks' lineup today. Tanaka has had his ups and downs for sure this season, but should have success against this Oakland team that owns a .650 OPS against K-pitchers. I think today's game will probably reach 7 runs total by the 5th and think NY should edge one out today, so I'm taking the Yanks ML (-150) and over 8 runs total.  TOR @ CWS  Well last night was heartbreaking for anyone that had money on the Jays. Hey here's a fun fact, the White Sox own a .738 OPS in the month of July, which is significantly higher than they've had at any point this season. Here's another fun fact, right-handed batters away facing Dickey away from Rogers Centre own a .925 OPS against him on the season. I don't know if I trust Samardzija enough to ""shut down"" the Jays offense, but he should at least be able to hold them in check while the Sox lineup does work on Dickey. I really hate betting on the White Sox but can see Chicago taking the lead early and then blowing it in the later innings, so I like over 8 runs total.  TB @ KCR  KAAAARNS WE MEET AGAIN. Fucking Karns. He's my arch nemesis for no reason really. Quite honestly Karns and Ventura have similar peripherals, but the Royals clearly have the edge offensively, even with Gordon out for the foreseeable future. But after looking at splits, a sure bet on KC became less so; Ventura has struggled against lefties this season, as they've slashed .281/.359/.472 (.361 wOBA) against him this year. The Rays' offense has been decent over the past two weeks or so, but KC's has obviously been better. I hate betting against KC, so I won't, this game is a no play. Thought about over 7 runs total, but seems like a reach.  STL @ PIT  I'll preface this by saying this: Neither of these teams are hitting well right now. Over their past few games, both teams have been well below their season averages. But I'd purport that they faced hard pitchers (especially Pittsburgh who had the privilege of facing the heart of Cleveland's rotation). Both Locke and Martinez' peripherals indicate they are due for regression at least a touch, and it might come today as both are groundball pitchers facing teams that typically have success against similar pitchers. Beyond that, Martinez's 15% HR/FB ratio might be a factor today with heavy winds blowing out of left field. I don't really feel good enough about the over, but I like the Pirates as the dogs here especially taking the Cards against LHP stats into account. Taking the Pirates ML (even) for a small play and No Runs 1i.  DET @ MIN  Okay assholes, listen up. Let's take a second to actually analyze this line here. Over 8 runs total. Here's why it could happen: Both teams are on fire and the Tigs are great against groundball pitchers like Pelfrey. Conversely, the Twins aren't as bad against power pitchers as other teams, and could put up a few against Price. Here's why it couldn't happen: David Fucking Price is on the mound, who has allowed more than 4 runs in a game only once all season (a freak occurrence, against the Yankees). Beyond that, the most earned runs he's given up away from Comerica this year is three. Conversely, Pelfrey's home stats are just as nuts as Price's away stats. The most runs Pelfrey has given up at Target Field is three, and that only happened once. Price gave up 3 runs to the Twins once this year already, but he also threw 8.2 shutout frames against them as well. The two times Pelfrey faced the Tigs this year, he gave up 1 ER in one start (at Target) and 4 ER in the other (at Comerica). Quite frankly, I don't give a shit about the over/under in this game because I think there isn't value in the line period. Could it go over? Yeah, I guess. But is it probable? I'd think not with Price on the mound. Which leads me to my next point, the -110 price of the over is close enough to the -135 offered on the Tigers ML for me to want to play that instead. Also playing No Runs 1i for a small bet.  ATL @ COL  I'm running out of time here, but my book has the total at 10. If you can get over 10 runs total, I'd take it based on the way these offenses are playing and the way teams tee off of Kendrick at Coors Field (.296/.364/.608)."

Somehow, Phillies get themselves out of a jam. I was taking a walk, saw the bases loaded, and thought, well there goes my money.   Kept walking, after a few minutes, checked again, and end 1st, no runs. I was wondering two things, why is luck returning now and not earlier, and second, how the hell did the dodgers not score? The probability of a run had to be over 50%."

sportsbook,3cm6i1,fatwogtits,3,Thu Jul 9 04:25:40 2015 UTC,"Finally something i can comment on My tips in order of confidence (but AFL has been pretty shocking to bet on this year)  Richmond - should win by at least 20 Sydney - will dominate injury plagued lions Collingwood - also should win by 20+ Melbourne - expect a good game with a melbourne win West coast - not as certain because of phil walsh, but west coast is a quality side  Personally i wouldnt touch  freo vs hawks (bad odds, played in tassie)  bulldogs vs suns (ablett..)  cats vs north (i go for cats, both teams are inconsistent - i would love for the cats to win but north beat us at home earlier this year)"

Try to steer clear of NRL this close either side of Origin but yeah Warriors and will 100% tail on Collingwood ae.
sportsbook,3cm6i1,AmateurWorlock,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:38:09 2015 UTC,Betting on a Warriors game is like playing Russian roulette with two bullets. Warriors have lost Hoffman and the Storm have lost their last 3 games  but have Cronk back in the side. My book has the Storm at 2.40 ML Warriors at 1.52 ML. I'll be on the Storm.

sportsbook,3cm6i1,plato44,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:42:08 2015 UTC,"had $500 on pies but cashed out 450, still think they'll win but the original odds and line movement today is crazy considering the public is pounding collingwood hard"
sportsbook,3cm6i1,jamescarrotboy,2,Thu Jul 9 03:06:21 2015 UTC,"haha, I've also put $500 on pies but can't cash out, any idea what's causing these fluctuations? I'm concerned there must be an injury that's not released yet or something"
sportsbook,3cm6i1,mediocredolphin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:46:54 2015 UTC,"there might be a smaller group of people betting more money on port than the majority and evening up the odds OR (in theory) the majority of money is on the pies but the books think theyve got the odds spot on and are prepared to gamble on port winning/it being a very close game  second scenario is 'reverse line movement' - doesnt mean port will definitely win, i still think the pies will win comfortably but im not prepared to stake so much on my own instincts vs the bookmakers sports analystics teams i suppose - usually i like to hop on teams in a spot port is in, but theyve proven themselves to be too shitty to want to bet on so far this year. i guess variables like the player changes for port/homeground/phil walsh factor could be a difference too. sports are fucking crazy anyway, nobody KNOWS what's exactly going to happen- state of origin last night for instance >_>"
sportsbook,3cm6i1,jamescarrotboy,2,Thu Jul 9 04:24:26 2015 UTC,"my original train of thought though is that the books have been overrating port all season, making them favourites even though they continually lose and haven't shown many signs. the difference is the public were betting on port to win those 'easy games' at home anyway, where as now everyone's on the pies but the books are staying firm in giving port even odds. i expected the odds to be 1.70-80 for collingwood by now (was 1.88 at one stage).  when i say EVERYONE etc i dont really know what money is being put on who im just using reddit, gambling twitter, general opinion and other afl-betting boards as sources. if anybody knows where that sort of info for australian sports is i'd love a link - like whats on thespread.com  (AND GOOOO PIEEEESssss)"
sportsbook,3cm6i1,jamescarrotboy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:28:41 2015 UTC,"I believe Port overtaking as favourites is a bait tactic by bookmakers, do you reckon? All of a sudden Port Adelaide took over as favourites at many bookmakers to make Collingwood $1.95-$2.00 odds to collect more Collingwood bets. I'm near positive majority of the money from the public is going on Collingwood, so why are Pt Adelaide now $1.80-$1.85?"

sportsbook,3ckx3f,duncanbishop24,3,Thu Jul 9 03:46:39 2015 UTC,"When I was new to sportsbetting, I found it easier to start off with decimal odds (just for a convenience of, lets say, 2.45 odds and you bet $1, u win $1.45), but anyways...I don't think that's the question you were asking.  Basically, the + or - just show's who the favorite is, the same way the spread works. In Asian handicap,  At .25 means if you win, you win. If you draw, you win/lose half. If you lose, you lose.   At .50, if you win, you win. If draw, you win. If lose, you lose. etc..  A helpful site for this: http://www.betshoot.com/asian-handicap-betting/  European handicap is pretty similar to the spread and is what you see when betting on the majority of soccer games. Example: a team to stay +1 or win by -1. Or predict a winner or the draw in regulation.   Hope this helps!"
sportsbook,3ckx3f,Orange-Potatoes,0,Wed Jul 8 18:58:38 2015 UTC,"Is betting an Asian handicap or European handicap advantageous? Or should I stick to O/U and win/lose?  Also what about bets like halftime scores, hat tricks, exact scorelines, etc? Should I ever bet on those?"

But most of my bets are soccer and hokey so point spread is usually really more a way to just take the tie out of the equation.  Bet small, figure things out...more importantly, watch the games.  I'll bet on stuff I don't watch, but you bet to have fun, not to make a living, so watch the game, enjoy it even as a neutral, with money on the game it's more entertaining as long as it's not too much.  Also prop bets are always fun."

Today, these were the only ones I felt confident in. The moment I saw the Cards/Cubs line my eyes lit up because I already have a ton of confidence in Wacha and Hammels.   The Mets have deGrom pitching, and their slow offense this month makes them an easy target for a No Runs 1st.

sportsbook,3ci0dc,j3rown,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:18:04 2015 UTC,Problem is Shoemaker is terrible. He gives up a ton of HRs so I don't see him doing well in Denver. LAA bats been on a tear though so I am still leaning their way. ...or over 11.5 @ +145?
sportsbook,3ci0dc,TheSpooneh,11,Thu Jul 9 00:30:30 2015 UTC,"Verified Record  This Day in Baseball History: (1951) After Joe DiMaggio commits an error in center field, Yankee manager Casey Stengel replaces the aging superstar with rookie Jackie Jensen. The skipper's decision to make the move in the middle of the game strains an already acrimonious relationship.  ATL @ MIL  This will be an interesting game because Milwaukee's offense has clawed its way back to respectability. Fiers has really came into his own this season as he strikes out 9.10 per 9 while allowing less than one donger per 9 (9.2% HR/FB). He should have a field day against this Barves lineup that struggles against power pitchers AND flyball pitchers, as Fiers falls under both categories. Teheran will probably struggle against this hot Brewers lineup that owns a .742 OPS against flyball pitchers. I'm pretty confident in MIL ML (-150).  DET @ SEA  I can't figure out Anibal Sanchez this season. His 3.70 SIERA is below his career average, he's striking out more per 9 than he did last year, yet his homeruns and walks are wayyyy up, both of which contribute to his 4.26 FIP. For some reason he's struggled against RHB's this year, but it is definitely worth noting that he's gotten better as the season has progressed. The worry here is that the Mariners seem to have found their power stride as of late, as they've smacked 8 HR in their last 6 games (while still somehow maintaining an OPS under .700). Meanwhile, JA Happ has silently put up a respectable season, not posting impressive numbers, but numbers good enough to keep runs off the board. These are two hot-hitting offenses right now, and I know everyone is super-hyped on the Tigs 18-game ""over"" run, but there is a good shot it ends today. No play edit: taking under 8 runs total out of spite of all the people thinking that because something has hit x amount of times in a row is good enough logic to play something again.  HOU @ CLE  Hard to say how Straily will fare against Cleveland since his MLB exposure is limited, but here's what I know about him: He's a strikeout guy for sure, who relies on his slider as an ""out"" pitch. His fastball is pretty mediocre, he doesn't throw his curve much, his change is pretty legit but overall his game lives and dies by his slider. Straily's downfall today will be that his slider isn't particularly effective against lefties and his LHB stats reflect that (they bat .241/.339/.428 against him w/ .338 wOBA), and the Indians are loaded with southpaws (Kipnis, Lindor, Brantley, Murphy, Moss, Santana, Bourn). Bauer has proven inconsistent this season, but he matches up against the Astros well and has already taken them to town once this season. I like the Indians ML (-135) and over 8 runs total (-110).  ARI @ TEX  Oooooh boy so this is Matt Harrison's first game back from a crucial surgery, and it can't have come against a worse team. Not only are the dbags hot as fuck right now, southpaw Harrison's kryptonite has always been power RHBs, and the dbags have plenty of those. Conversely, as bad as Hellickson has looked at points this season, the Rangers are struggling pretty badly right now offensively. Riding the Dbags ML (+105) with plus odds for a second straight day.  TOR @ CWS  Let's see...the Jays own a .795 OPS against flyball pitchers, and a .841 OPS against LHP. I hate the Blue Jays but I've always been pretty high on Drew Hutchison as his stuff has flashes of being electric. He's enjoying a better year than his 5.23 ERA indicates (3.71 FIP), and his strikeout stuff will more than likely be a problem for the Sox, as they struggle against K-pitchers. The White Sox have looked ""better"" lately, but I think the Jays have a clear edge here. Taking the Blue Jays ML (-150).  PHI @ LAD  This is a bet solely out of principle. +300 odds on any ML team is dumb. Will the Phillies lose? With an almost 90% of certainty Probably. But that being said, weirder things have happened in baseball, and the Phillies have definitely given the Dodgers a run for their money this series. Phillies ML (+300) because how can you say no to that?"

sportsbook,3ci0dc,j3rown,2,Wed Jul 8 16:01:40 2015 UTC,"Thought I would mention that (+300) Gives Phillies a 25% chance to win. Dodgers at (-400) gives LA an 80% chance to win.

Peavy was OK in his return from the DL.  Hopefully he can build off that against a floundering offense.  ATL (+160)  I understand Teheran struggles on the road, but I still can't look at this game and think the Braves have <40% chance here, so it looks like value to me.  WAS -1.5 (+140)  Having a hard time seeing the Reds get the sweep on the road on the back of Lorenzen, who has pitched above his head to this point.  On the other side, Gio has had some tough luck (.345 BABIP), but has finally gotten solid results the last couple times out.  I'll take the superior team to actually show that they are superior for once in this series.  ARI (+106)  Going back to the well here.  Matt Harrison coming back from spinal fusion surgery, and there are virtually no expectations for him.  He has not been that great in his rehab appearances, and has struggled to regain his velocity.

The Dodgers opened with Yimi Garcia, a RP, at a line around -250. They very nearly lost that game. Today, they threw up Anderson against Billingsly, and lost at a line -270. Now -370 for Kershaw?   I don't care who is pitching, when you're 1-1 in the series, the odds suggest winning 80% of the time. Kershaw with the ""runs"" he has gotten in support this year, is not going to win 80% of the time against the Phillies.

sportsbook,3ci0dc,j3rown,3,Wed Jul 8 17:34:57 2015 UTC,"Braves +130  I know this line has dropped a ton but I got up a little late on the East Coast because I took a day off of work today. The dome at Miller should be open today because the radar shows no chance of rain. Air density at Miller Park is going to be high today, but that shouldn't affect either pitcher because they both throw majority fastballs. What really intrigues me about this game though is that you may look at Teherans away stats and say ""Wow, this guy sucks ass how is he in the MLB?"" But as I dug deeper I learned that Julio has been getting screwed over, giving up more than league average Flyballs/HR's. Shown in his low xFIP, Teheran has been pitching close and/or better than Mike Fiers. Fiers has been solid at home and in his recent outings, but his one weakpoint this year has been lefties. I expect the Braves to pack a lefty strong lineup today.  Diamondbacks +105  Their is nothing particularly unusual about this game other than I don't think Hellickson and the Dbacks should be + money against a guy making his first start in 2015. The density is lower than average, and Hellickson mixes his pitches up very well, throwing a mix of fastballs and breaking balls. On the other side Harrison has showed in 2014 that he throws mainly fastballs and other than that he does not really have so much control over what he can throw for a strike. I think the Dbacks are a very underrated team this year, and most vegas lines show that. I think this is one of the better bets today.  Astros +124  3 dogs today is an all time best for me. The air density at Progressive today is higher than usual, meaning it will favor the fastball pitcher. Straily is making his second start of the year, and he showed in his first outing that he throws a 50/50 mix of fastballs and sliders. Past numbers show that he throws a majority fastball, so the numbers should even out over time. On the other side is Trevor Bauer, who throws a good mix of fastballs and breaking balls. I think Straily comes out feeling he has something to prove to the Astros org. as a newcomer. He should come out giving the Indian hitters a hard time with his high velocity fastball."
sportsbook,3ci0dc,Always_Correct_Gifs,2,Wed Jul 8 15:49:22 2015 UTC,"Quick note: Straily isn't a ""fastball"" pitcher per se...I mean most pitchers throw a fastball the majority of the time, but he doesn't rely on it to get batters out. His fast stuff has some decent velocity on it (usually sits around 94 mph) but is very hittable, and his slider isn't going to be as effective as he'd like against an almost all LHB lineup."
sportsbook,3ci0dc,j3rown,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:07:58 2015 UTC,"In 2014 he held lefty hitters to a .244 BABIP, and from the game charts it seems his fastball is very effective vs. L.

sportsbook,3ci0dc,AegisYuri,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:39:47 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt he will be fastball-heavy today (because he really has nothing else he can throw effectively against lefties), but I think that explains LHBs stats against him.

However I am viscerally disgusted with the arse licking and creepy ""Yes sir, No Sir"" attitude this sub has towards him, so I enjoy pissing off degenerate addicts by making flippant comments (the game isn't over yet, it may not end up as 0-2 but it riles up d'gens).  However this is a small percentage of my posts, most of them are asking genuine questions about how US capping works or trying to set straight morons who don't understand value.

Gigounon is also on the rise, and was at his peak ranking of 195 just last month, Gojowyczk has slipped from 79 last last year to now be sitting at 159. These two have never met before but on this surface the odds look excellent on the improving player with a clay preference.    Update - Challenger Braunschweig Alexander Zverez to defeat Daniel Brands @1.57 L Zverev won this tournament last season as a break-out victory for him (was ranked 665 at the time is now 76) and he has a 9-2 record on clay this year. Brands is 7-6 on clay this year and has plummetted in the rankings since 2014 and has never made it past this round at this tournament. Both are big servers and Zverev is still only 18 so is prone to taking the occasional set off (Won 6-0, 1-6, 6-3 yesterday) so I'd avoid straight sets or unders.

He's not been sitting around mediocrity since late 2012 and even when he's showing some of his old brilliance it's still not very impressive. Pigbaby is a solid player who's been improving steadily over the past year and is solid in all matchups. In a bo5 I don't see Pigbaby dropping this series. 5U  Small plays/Leans:  TRUE ML against Solar @2.412. LOSS 3-2 loss when TRUE was up 2-1 :(  Bit of a value play, but I still like it anyways. True was considered one of the ZvZ kings of 2014 and it still remains his strongest matchups. Solar is also considered a ZvZ expert and the players have a 16-12 match history in favor of Solar. Caveat: Solar did not look in form at all lately just 2-3 days ago, he looked tired, unpracticed, and sloppy. Solar has always excelled in 2 places: foreign weekend tournaments and online matches. I see this as a close 50/50 match in which I believe TRUE has the edge. 3U   Losira vs TY - skipping this match personally, but I'd probably put a unit on Losira. I think this match favors TY slightly, but Losira is being undervalued here for sure @ 2.491. I'd say actual price should be about @2.2. EDIT: Losira wins 3-2 if you played it!"

sportsbook,3ch09f,MouMoneyMouProblem,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:09:09 2015 UTC,"For SC2? No, I play the favorite more often than not. My average odds is around 1.87-1.95 winning around 58.3% over 190 bets.  For CS:GO? I almost always play underdogs and 50/50 matches only especially with all the DDOS/substitute issues that happen. My average odds are around 2.2-2.5 winning around 55.1% over around 150 bets."
sportsbook,3ch09f,TheSpooneh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:00:46 2015 UTC,"Dota 2 Futures  Team Secret to win TI5 - No @ -116  Even if the tournament was tomorrow and the form teams have showed for the past 2 months are indicative of their true form, I think this line is pretty good.   When you factor in that TI5 is over a month away, the meta usually completely shifts to something completely different and that all the teams will look significantly different for the biggest dota2 tournament in history, there is no way a single team is a favorite against the field.   Secret is doing very well these past 2 months because the current meta is favorable to them. That is not to say they havent showed the superior teamwork and individual skill these 2 months, but the gap between top teams teamwork and skill are minuscule - with a completely revamped meta and no major tournaments from now till TI5 enough will change that favoring a single team over the field is completely ridiculous  Even if secret appear dominant during the tournament there will be plenty of opportunities to find favorable opportunities to hedge the bets"

sportsbook,3ch09f,jsuok,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:04:23 2015 UTC,"The part where you said ""the gap between top teams teamwork and skill are miniscule"" I strongly disagree with, it's clear that EG and Secret are the best 2 teams right now, and that is mainly due to their teamwork and individual skill. All you have to do is look at ESL and MDL, where Secret were outdrafted on numerous occasions but still won due to their superior teamwork and skill level.  I agree, the meta could change, but it also could not. Taking this bet at this current time, is not smart. The odds aren't going to change closer to the event, as you said..there isn't any tournaments these teams are going to be playing in, due all practicing for TI5 (with the exception of C9 vs EG in dotapit finals)  I don't see there being another patch before TI5 either, and if that is the case, the likelihood of the meta switching is also slim."
sportsbook,3ch09f,kaisr1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:53:50 2015 UTC,"I do agree I take pretty liberal assumptions in my analysis, but do you think team secret is so much better than everyone else that they are a favorite against the field? That's like Alliance domination status before TI3 and even then their finals against NaVi was extremely close. Like I mentioned with a bet on the field, there will be ample opportunity to find good hedging opportunities.  As for odds changing, esports lines have huge swings from what I can only assume to be money going in, I'm just saying the current line of -116 is a steal for a bet on the field.  BTW how is dota2loungebets in terms of discussion/analysis quality? I'm looking for someone else or just a group to discuss dota 2 betting with, especially for pregame betting when they allow you to bet through the draft."

sportsbook,3cd5m5,TakeThePoints,4,Tue Jul 7 05:37:10 2015 UTC,"Something fairly interesting I noted about double headers (and maybe this is too small of a sample to mean anything)...  There have been 9 sets of double headers so far this season (meaning 18 total games). In the 9 early double header games, only 1 total run was scored in those 9 1st innings. So if you had bet no first inning runs in all 9 of those double header first games you would have gone 8-1. Knowing this do either of the two double header first games seem any more intriguing or one of them more so than the other? STL/CHC and TB/KC  Edit: Won both of these today (Despite Moore's best efforts). Early doubleheader games are now 10-1 this season for no runs scored in the first inning"
sportsbook,3cd5m5,IWasRightOnce,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:07:16 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I think that has a lot to do with the fact that these games are day games essentially, and given the sunlight, it is much harder to hit a ball during the day than at night, especially when you're just starting the first.   Of course, that point gets mooted when it is overcast out."
sportsbook,3cd5m5,FrozenFlamethrower,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:24:52 2015 UTC,"Yea I figured this was at least partially due to the daytime, early game factor that has been discussed here.

sportsbook,3cd5m5,Invol2ver,36,Tue Jul 7 18:40:36 2015 UTC,"While Sonny Gray doesn’t give up many HRs, he is susceptible to giving them up under the a specific scenario: To lefties with pull power, and these are the Yankees, and this is Yankee Stadium. Tuesday actually marks the first time Gray has ever pitched in the Bronx. With his career 45.8% Pull % and 10.7% HR/FB to lefties, I won’t surprised me if he has a tough night in NY. Not that I think Eovaldi fares much better vs. a lefty-heavy Oakland lineup, which is why my play here is on the OAK/NYY Over 8 +100. I think both teams represent viable stacks for DFS, and I wonder if the A’s will be super low owned.     So this is an interesting one. Big question for me is what split do we believe to be more predictive for Dan Haren on Tuesday night: His 2015 RHB split or his career RHB split. Because in 2015, he’s actually shut righties down and really limited the hard contact and pull% to them, which is big with the Monster in left and a ton of wind pushing his flyballs that way. But if you look at his career numbers vs RHB (44% pull %, 34.9% flyball %, 28.3% hard hit rate, 1.11 HR/9), Boston righties like Mookie Betts, Xander Bogaerts, and Hanley Ramirez look real attractive. To tip the scales, I looked at Haren’s recent year splits. Since he’s been in the league a while, I wanted to see if his career numbers were so far off 2015 splits due to some weird early year stats. But that doesn’t appear to be the case. So I’m calling Boston the stack of the night in DFS, and fully expect them to pull their weight in my MIA/BOS Over 9 -110 bet. Expecting Wade Miley to pull his weight was never a concern. As a lefty, he naturally struggles in Fenway but he especially struggles on nights like this. His RHB splits are atrocious, both for this year and his career. Expect to see some Miami randos with HRs Tuesday night.      I think it’s funny how many people think Doubront gets blown up Tuesday night. Dudes, he’s facing the White Sox. As a Red Sox fan, I get that Doubront is a mop up long reliever at best, but the White Sox vs LHP is an absolute joke. We’re talking dead last wOBA and wRC+ in in the majors and it’s not even close. I’m serious. The White Sox current roster has a .255 wOBA and 55 wRC+ vs LHP this year. Next closest is Milwaukee with .272 and 67. It’s basically a 29 team ranking vs lefties…and then the White Sox. How on earth can a team this awful vs southpaws only be a +108 dog? I don’t understand why people continue to think this garbage lineup is due to turn things around. Meanwhile, the Blue Jays are phenomenal vs lefties in the same way that the White Sox are terrible against them. Their .376/140 active roster wOBA/wRC+ vs lefties is miles ahead of the rest of baseball, and again, it’s not even close. 2nd place belongs to the Tigers at a .347/121 split. How on earth are the Blue Jays only a -118 favorite!??!? I feel like I’m taking I’m taking crazy pills. I’m seriously so baffled by this game that I’ve decided it’s either a max bet for me or a no play because the line is so fishy. But after looking at all the guys who are inexplicably on Chicago tomorrow, I feel confident going Toronto -118 for the max here. Enjoy.     I actually think they eventually get this game in despite the likelihood of storms delaying it a few hours. I’m going with Colorado +120 in this one, largely because I can’t envision Andrew Heaney keeping the ball in the yard vs the strong Colorado right handed bats. At first glance, Heaney’s ability to avoid HRs this year appears impressive. He’s gone 13 innings against 2 of the hardest hitting teams in baseball (NYY and HOU) with only 1 HR allowed. But remember that the Yankees struggle vs lefties and Houston strikes out a ton making them super streaky. Heaney’s career numbers vs right handed bats are really awful (.370 wOBA, 2.33 HR/9), and they don’t include any starts at Coors. Colorado’s started, Chad Bettis, is built for the altitude of Denver. He throws just as much offspeed stuff as he does fastballs, meaning that the air density can actually help him. We’re talking about a league-average guy who has managed to keep his HR/9 to 1.03 in 62 innings at Coors. That’s pretty good. Granted, the Angels lineup is super hot at the moment, and while Bettis doesn’t let up long balls, he still allows his fair share of baserunners. It won’t be pretty, but I see Colorado taking this one 7-4, or something like that."

sportsbook,3cd5m5,BR2015,2,Wed Jul 8 01:39:16 2015 UTC,i read this sub purely for entertainment but i do have analysis on your max play.   the line is low b/c you have a hot starter (quint) vs a starter not good enough to crack toronto's rotation (thats saying something).   a hot team (sox won 5 of last 6) vs a team that is struggling. people remember the jays long win streak but anyone who follows baseball knows they are actually struggling right now. not to mention jays struggle on the road period.   also i hate the stat of the jays killing left handed pitching. a baseball season is all about ebb and flow. they are NOT killing left handed pitching right now. seriously over the last two weeks which left hander have they destroyed?   the line is set just right if you ask me. coin flip game at most. just my counter argument as to why the line is so low. baseball isn't all about stats. good luck.

But humour me, this is a genuine question.  For a 4 Unit bet it seems your reasoning is essentially. This team is good at hitting left handers and it is playing a team that is shit at hitting right handers. Using two statistics to back it up.   Do you believe that the bookmakers who set the lines do not have access to these statistics? That they are not already factored into the line? Are Vegas unaware of the White Sox' poor performance against left handers?  Surely if the gulf in abilities in batting is go great, as you say. Vegas will be aware of this and the odds will reflect something else (motivation, starting pitcher ability, etc etc)"
sportsbook,3cd5m5,seethingslug,5,Tue Jul 7 13:55:08 2015 UTC,"Gambling lines have mostly nothing to do with the players and the game, but everything to do with the bookmaker making money.    Bookmakers have access to this, but their goal is to set the line such that even money is bet on both sides of the line, such that they can rake on the juice and not be stacked against a team if the public rails on one side of the line.  If that happens, they move the line to encourage betting on the other side."
sportsbook,3cd5m5,dabecka,4,Tue Jul 7 14:04:23 2015 UTC,"I get that, but initially Vegas will set what they believe to be ""fair"" lines (baring in mind Vegas knows more about the sport than anyone here could dream to) and then the lines are pushed to equilibrium by the publics money.  Surely if Toronto was such value we would have seen a significant shortening of the odds?   Maybe it's just the fundamental distinction between Asian markets (where generally it's presumed the betting public are smart) and Vegas markets where it's assumed the public are idiots (no offence)"
sportsbook,3cd5m5,seethingslug,14,Tue Jul 7 14:10:14 2015 UTC,"It's spelled ""offense"", and wow, I don't know where to begin with you dude. First off, I am truly sorry for whatever happened in your life to cause you to be an internet troll. Hope it gets better for ya.   Few points:    The idea that books are setting lines to get 50/50 action is one of the most overblown half-truths out there. The reality is that getting 50/50 action is almost impossible in most cases so why not set lines that give themselves either better odds against the team that will inevitably get more action? Alternatively, why not set lines that acknowledge extreme action on one side but is set so high that it limits volume/exposure? That's how this really works. Books take positions all of the time. Get past the belief that the market is efficient and set to get 50/50 action and you'll be a much better capper. Don't believe that the market is inefficient?  Track the delta between implied odds (or spread, in sports like NFL and NBA) and final score. You can even use the closing line. It won't matter. The average delta is huge. It may feel like a lot of games end up right around where the line set it, but those are just more obvious. The average delta is massive. The books don't care because the position they take is right more than the public. Plus, having a 10-point vig doesn't hurt. Vegas absolutely does not know more about the sport than anyone else. There is a reason why books lock people out or set lower limits for certain people (I was essentially banned from Bovada) and it's because they know that someone who is dedicated to a specific sport or collegiate conference can get an edge by putting in more work than the books do. Listen to a podcast with Bob Scucci or some other book manager and tell me they know what they are talking about. They are good at one thing: Setting lines at a macro level and predicting what team(s) the sheep will flock to game to game and set lines accordingly. They are not looking at the advanced statistics side of things outside of macro models that are directionally accurate but not without weakness. To your original question, you are correct that my analysis and perceived edge in this game is fairly superficial and based on very available statistics. But for whatever reason, a lot of big bettors have faith in the White Sox offense turning things around. I just checked a Twitter feed that I use to follow some of the bigger Twitter cappers (not touts) and I'm seeing Chicago plays left and right. I acknowledged in my write up that the line seemed fishy and to me it was almost a no play. Going 4 units seems extreme too, but all the stats I rely on point in that direction regardless of the line, and I after looking at the direction so many people seem to be going on this one, I am convinced that the books set the line this low because they knew they'd get Chicago action vs Doubront regardless. Anyway, it's already creeped up to -121 and will likely close in the -130 range."

That the public are just dribbling messes and are betting on White Sox for some reason (even though there are very obvious stats that point to them struggling against left handed pitching) and so the books can offer great odds on Toronto for the ""sharps"" to exploit?

sportsbook,3cd5m5,seethingslug,2,Tue Jul 7 14:30:32 2015 UTC,"Initial odds are typically super soft and set with low limits.

sportsbook,3cd5m5,Bryanhenry,11,Wed Jul 8 20:39:17 2015 UTC,"verified record  TDiBS: (2000) Drawing one of its largest crowds, the Butte Copper Kings newest promotion, 'John Rocker Awareness Night', is a huge success when the Angel farm club of the Pioneer League offers free admission to anyone belonging to a group insulted by the Atlanta reliever in his Sports Illustrated interview. The 672 fans in attendance include single moms with multiple children, people with purple hair, 'foreigners', as well as people with alternative lifestyles.  No time for early writeups, will have late games posted later. Here's what I'm playing in the afternoon:   CHC ML g1 (-164) TB/KC No Runs 1i   SDP @ PIT  Let's just start with this: No runs 1i (small bet); Both Ross and Liriano are pretty strong over the 1st inning, Liriano only giving up 2 runs in the first all season and Ross 5. More importantly, batters stats against them are pretty bad. I've made my thoughts clear about the Padres offense lately, but let me go ahead and reiterate: their offense is as effective as using one tampon to mop up an oil tanker spill. Their offense is about as effective as a sole McDonald's line chef attempting to bartend a large wedding. Their offense is worse than getting sewage (think Robocop) in an open wound. Their offense is weaker than a Long Island Iced Tea from TGI Fridays. Their offense is weaker than line of jaundiced alcohol-syndrome affected babies. They. Aren't. Good. And the worst part is, they should be. When your 3 and 4 hitters are Kemp and the non-abysmal Upton, you should be pretty fucking good. But they just aren't, and watching the Padres is less exciting than watching the White Sox. At least there is an air of pathetic defeat that's entertaining to watch in the White Sox.  But I digress.  Where was I? Ah, yes, why there won't be a run scored in the first. Don't get me wrong, the Pirates are doing pretty good right now, but are bad enough against K-pitchers for me to think that Tyson Ross can squeeze by three batters without consequence (especially since he keeps the ball in the yard). There is a worry that Gregory Polanco could get on base as Ross isn't stellar against LHBs, but then even so, Ross pitches well under pressure. I do, however, think that eventually the Pirates will be able to string up enough hits against Ross or the Paddies 'pen that they'll win the game. Oh yeah, and the fact that the Padres are abysmal against K-pitchers to the tune of .206/.264/.296. I like the Pirates ML (-137) at odds that I think are a damn gift.  ARI @ TEX  Yovani Gallardo is having a ""career year""...except not really, because he's overperforming like a motherfucker. 2.56 ERA/3.47 FIP, .256 BAbip (while his career average is .292), while nothing has really changed in his pitching mechanics/velocity/etc. He is due to fuck up, and I think it comes tonight against the hot-hitting Dbags who've done quite well for themselves over the last two weeks (.279/.349/.434). I would say that the groundball-pitching Gallardo will pose some trouble for Arizona, and he probably will, but if you've watched the Diamondbacks play recently, shit man, they just look dialed in at the plate. I think Robbie Ray and the dbags are being highly undervalued here, and with the wind blowing in from right field, flyball pitcher Ray should have success against this Rangers team that already struggles against similar flyball pitchers. I like Dbags ML (+137) for the price more than anything. Also playing under 8.5 runs total for a smaller play because of the pitching matchup and wind.  TOR @ CWS  Nothing really needs to be said here. Toronto kills LHPs (not named Chris Sale) and the White Sox are typically poor against LHPs. It was a miracle the Sox put 4 runs on the board yesterday. Blue Jays ML (-115) is great value."

Mariners are 5-0 in his last 5 starts with a 1.68 ERA. Been riding him during this streak. The streaks collide! Might still go Over since Kyle Ryan is whatever with Mariners ML to balance it out.

To be honest, I'm still a little bit shocked that I'm betting numbers that are better than the vig-free closing lines so consistently. I'm sure actual professionals would laugh because to them betting low-limit reduced juice overnights is probably like taking candy from a baby, but I'm pumped about it. I keep waiting for it to stop, but pretty much every day I keep getting value. Still waiting on all of the games to start today but it looks like it will be another good day from a line value perspective.   Also, a word of advice for anyone that decides to tail these. Try to bet them before limits are raised and lines move the day of the games. At that point, I'm not even sure if I have an edge anymore because I haven't been tracking that. For the time being though I'm fairly confident I have an edge against the 5Dimes overnights. It's a small edge and it's of course far from invulnerable to variance or bad luck (as displayed by my -10 unit hole at the beginning), but I'm becoming increasingly convinced it's real.   Also I'm still determining my threshold for betting, but the larger bets thus far have in reality ended up having a higher average edge than the smaller bets, which is a good sign."

sportsbook,3cd5m5,savagerebel,2,Tue Jul 7 13:15:28 2015 UTC,"Rays GM1 +108  I feel like the Rays got a much needed break yesterday so they could clear their heads of the spanking they have gotten. In their past 10 games, the Rays went 2-8. Their only wins came from winning 1 game in a 3 game series with the Yankees and Red Sox. They got swept in the middle of those series by the Indians. They are lead by Matt Moore, coming in for his second start of the year. From what we saw in his one game earlier, he favors his fastball over much else, and is much better pitching to righties than lefties. The wind is blowing in heavily from right field. and today the Royals lineup has 7 R's and 2 L's. Chris Young goes on the mound for KC. He also relies on his fastball, but he only has 3 pitches. Ned Yost is giving a break to Cain, Perez, and Moustakas, opening up some weaker spots in the righty heavy lineup.  Giants -134  As much as I hate hate hate this line, I feel like this is probably the best time to take the Giants. I know Bochy isn't an idiot, he knows they are in a slump, and he knows that putting in bench players will not give him the best chance to win. I expect an all-hands-on-deck esque lineup from the Giants. They put Matt Cain on the mound today, who has been on the DL for most of the season. The air density is high once again in AT&T, but looking at Cains' '14 stats and Colons '15 stats, they are both majority fastball pitchers, with Cain mixing up his pitches a bit more than Colon. Colon has struggled more away than he has at home this year posting a 1.26 WHIP away. I feel like Cains '14 stats are a little weighted because hey that team won the World Series. I think today is the day that the Giants will have the best chance in this series to steal a win.  I will also be playing TOR -110 but you can look at EL's post about that, he covered most of the bases."

It's a fun side hobby, and I do it purely for that. I started with a small amount of money and every time I get to 4x my bankroll I just withdraw to pay some debts, it's nice to occasionally not have to worry about a CC bill or student loan payment for a month. I've noticed that when I start playing with money that's too big I tend to hit loss streaks.   Bankroll management is probably the most important to being a decent bettor though."

sportsbook,3c8ut6,rs1x,30,Mon Jul 6 00:00:54 2015 UTC,"verified record  I'm back.  This Day in Baseball History: Hey, remember when the Phillies weren't a steaming pile of excrement? Back in 2009, in the most lopsided loss in franchise history, the Reds are routed by the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park, 22-1. The previous dubious mark was a 20-run differential which was established in 1892 when the Reds lost, 26-6, also to Philadelphia.  SDP @ PIT  This is an interesting matchup. James Shields has been an interesting case so far this year insomuch that he's been striking out way more guys than he has in previous years (10.61 K/9 this season, compared to a career average of 7.81), yet he's also giving up more home runs this year...in one of the most pitcher-friendly ballparks in the league. This might be because batters are making a little more ""hard"" contact off him (32.6% this year, career average of 29.4%). It's funny, because my guess is the same thing that's made him more dangerous this year is the same thing that's made him more HR-prone. Shields has thrown hella curveballs this year (22.3%, compared to his career average of 14.3%), which has resulted in more swings on balls outside the zone and less contact overall. Anyway, it's hard to bet on the Padres (or against the Pirates) right now just because of recent offensive performance. The Padres have just been horrible, posting a .168/.243/.277 line over their last 6 games. It seems their offense just keeps getting worse as the season progresses, as they've posted worse stats every month since the season began. But in this pitching matchup, I'd give the Padres the edge here. The Pirates don't have great stats against K-pitchers (.220/.296/.342), and I could see Shields putting up 6+ strikeouts against the Buccos today. Conversely, one of the few areas the Pads lineup are actually decent at is hitting heavy groundball pitchers (.258/.323/.386 against said pitchers) like Burnett who has induced 54.7% groundballs so far this year. That being said, I like the plus-odds on the Pads because this is a ""coin-tossy"" game to me. On the other hand, I hate betting on teams that have little going offensively. I'm going to stay away from the ML one way or the other on this one, but I like No Runs 1i here, and James Shields over 5 Ks.  HOU @ CLE  Definitely the game to watch today, but also definitely a tough game to bet on. I'll start by stating the obvious: Carrasco is one of the league's top K/9 guys (8th), and the Astros are back on top in terms of team strikeouts. Suffice to say, the 'Stros don't bat power pitchers like Carrasco well, slashing .175/.274/.313 against similar hurlers. Similarly, the slumping Indians offense does poorly against groundball pitchers, and Keuchel is one of the league's best (64.5% GB%). The only real edge here comes in the splits. Carrasco has been pretty hittable at Progressive this year, especially vs RHBs. I can see Altuve and Correa having big games today, and I'll play the Astros ML (even) as the 'dogs today. I'll also be playing No Runs 1i.  STL @ CHC  Fun fact: Both Lester and Lackey have the same FIP (3.44), and their peripherals are comparable. Sure, Lester K's more guys, but he also gives up more HRs while Lackey has been pretty good at keeping the ball in the park (7.2% HR/FB). Offensively both the Cubs and Cards have been pretty not great in July, posting BAs under .200 and OPS's under .700. As expected, Lackey's kryptonite has been LHBs this season, and between Rizzo, Coghlan and Montero, the Cubs will probably give Lackey a run for his money. As it sits I think the Cubs lineup is currently stronger than the Cards, as the Cards are without a decent 1B option and also without Holliday for the time being. Between that and Lackey's road splits, I like the Cubbies ML (-127) and because of the wind being very hitter-friendly at Wrigley today, I also like over 8 runs total.  BAL @ MIN  Too even of a matchup to play the ML today really...Chen is definitely the better pitcher (better FIP and SIERA), but both pitchers are flyball pitchers, and while the O's typically aren't good against FB-heavy throwers, the Twinsies are. But at the same time, Hughes is no stranger to the long ball and quite frankly the O's have lived and died by the donger lately. Over their last 6 games they've bat poorly but have still hit 7 HR. Batters have a pretty good slugging % off Hughes, and I think his downfall today will be the longball. I think all the way around I just don't feel strong enough to play anything. Weather favors playing the over, but I don't trust that both offenses will show up at the ballpark today. No play.  TOR @ CWS  This game is impossible to bet on. I'm not going to bet against Chris Sale, who is one start away from making history by being the first player to record double-digit strikeouts in 9 or more games (he's currently tied with Pedro Martinez with 8 straight). Meanwhile, today also marks hometown hero Buehrle's return to the southside of Chicago to more than likely beat up on the listless White Sox. Watch this game if you can, but keep your cash because there really isn't a safe bet here.  PHI @ LAD  This line is a slap in the face to the Phillies and Sean O'Sullivan. Regardless of the Phillies being the Phillies, they've still put up a .291/.349/.401 line over their last 6 games while the Dodgers' stats for their last 6 games looks more in line with what you'd expect from Philadelphia. In any case, it's egregious that the line would look like such seeing out LA pitcher Eric Surkamp has thrown but 53.2 Major League innings in his career, and not having that great a run at it. In any case, this game has Kershaw-type odds on it, and though I normally fade O'Sullivan, I think I almost have to put something on the Phillies ML (+200) out of principle.  DET @ SEA  If you take Miggy out of the Tigers lineup, they have a very mediocre setup, and I think we'll start to see them slide more and more into obscurity as the season progresses. The bulk of Detroit's troubles, however, has been their pitching. Alfredo Simon has gotten perpetually worse as the season has progressed, and it has to be a mental thing as these troubles seem to have started after his father passed at the end of May. Since then, he's just been missing his spots and constantly finding himself in jams. Simon typically struggles against LHBs, especially on the road (southpaw batters are hitting .316/.393/.585 against him away from Comerica), and the Mariners lineup will probably consist almost 100% of LHBs (Seager, Cano, Seth Smith, LoMo, Ackley, Miller...pretty much everyone but Cruz and Trumbo). And while Iwakuma has been shaky through 3 starts (4 ER in each), they were against teams with much more powerful hitters than Detroit. As long as he can keep the ball in the park, I feel decent about the Mariners ML (-162).  NYM @ SFG  I was originally going to stay away from this game, but then I dug deeper and found that the Giants should be the heavy favorite tonight, and here's why. Both Heston and Niese are groundball pitchers, but the Mets don't hit groundball pitchers well (nor are they a great road team), while the Giants destroy GB pitching (.287/.346/.418) and aren't horrible against LHPs. As inconsistent as Heston can be at times, today's weather benefits him greatly, and should be able to build on success he had in June against a weak offensive team. Heston owns a 2.59 FIP at AT&T...oh yeah and lest we not forget that Heston no hit the Mets once already this season. The Giants can't lose forever, and today is the day I'm guessing their shit streak ends. Taking the Giants ML (-133)."

sportsbook,3c8ut6,Exwind,2,Wed Jul 8 07:42:38 2015 UTC,"All three of my plays for tomorrow are money line picks. Most picks you'll find here backing a team are for money line plays unless otherwise stated as ""x team +/-1.5"" for the spread. I'm not gonna get into it, but I'm not a fan of spreads in baseball. People also post Over/Under plays, but that will be stated as ""x/y game Under 9"" (or whatever the line is).   Since you're new to baseball, let me be the one to tell you before you lose your entire bankroll that baseball's weird as shit and the only sport where a sudden blister, a few unexpected clouds, or a bullshit, fucked up strike zone that leads to a starting pitcher and manager being ejected (I'm looking at you, Phil Cuzzi) can drastically change the outcome of a game. Because of this, I would advise NOT to parlay baseball picks and only play single games.  FWIW: I'm pretty confident in both the Pirates and Royals tomorrow, but the lines are a little pricey. The Tigers game I'm a little less confident in, but I really like the line."

sportsbook,3c8ut6,dodger55fan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:34:52 2015 UTC,Why do you have the Ms so much higher than the Tigers on your modeler?
sportsbook,3c8ut6,skemp311,6,Mon Jul 6 16:23:26 2015 UTC,"The Mariners have better projections for their starter, bullpen, and defense. The projected presence of Alex Avila in for the injured Miguel Cabrera lowers the Tigers' win expectancy by a little over 2%.  Also, the heavy left-handed Mariners lineup projects really well against right-handed pitchers despite their offensive struggles this year.    The biggest reason the model likes the Mariners is that the offense with the players projected to play tomorrow is actually pretty decent. Sure through half of the season the offense has been terrible, but half of the season is a relatively small sample when projecting players with 1000+ plate appearances in recent seasons. Recent performance is certainly weighted more heavily per plate appearance, but it is far from weighted exclusively. The Mariners team wRC+ for the season is depressed by guys like Rickie Weeks, Chris Taylor and Willie Bloomquist who were absolutely terrible in their short stints.  None of those guys will be playing tomorrow. And the guys potentially playing tomorrow who have also been terrible like Mike Zunino, Mark Trumbo, and Robinson Cano (by his standards) have projections WAY better than their season to date stats.  And as I have said before, I regress ""my line"" to the market line when making my bet percentages.  So while ""my line"" is -205, by betting at a small fraction of Kelly, I'm effectively treating the true line as something much closer to the market price because it almost assuredly is."

KC -125  Beyond the splits, and home/away ERA for pitchers, both of which favor KC's batters and KC's pitcher (Volquez) - it's the lowest air pressure of the year that I've seen outside of Coors with an air density of 57 and wind blowing to left. This hurts fastballers like Colome and helps movement guys like Volquez. Real risk of this game being delayed/cancelled - but KC looks like a great value if the game gets in."

sportsbook,3c8ut6,_ugardii_,5,Mon Jul 6 17:07:29 2015 UTC,"Trying my hand at some writeups today:  NYM +123  The Mets are coming off an amazing series against the Dodgers where I believe they stole at least 1 of the 2 games they won in the three game series. On the other side we have the Giants, who got swept against arguably the best team in baseball right now. Jon Niese is on the mound for the Mets, opposing Chris Heston for the Giants. The air density at AT&T is low high today meaning this will help the fastball heavy Niese vs the Junkballer Heston. Heston has also struggled more at home than away and more vs lefties than righties. And, since being held hit-less vs Heston last outing, the Mets organization will be putting a little pressure on their hitters going into today's ballgame.  STL/NL Chi O8  Wind is blowing out at Wrigley during game time, meaning it will be a hitters park today. Lester has been known to give up big run games, and I imagine the hitters for Chi come out hungry for the first place spot in the division. This is the make-or-break week for the Cubs, meaning Joe Madden will make them come out with a fire in their eyes. Both pitchers are fastball heavy pitchers, meaning the sub-average air density will not help them. Oh and btw Lester can't pick off so I imagine every time a runner gets on base for the Cards, he will be looking to get into scoring position, thus creating more scoring chances for this Cards team."

More Hits, Runs and RBI: Gattis (-125) v Kipnis (-105) I would choose Kipnis since, I don't know he's a lot better player. This line kind of puzzled me. Gattis Kd 4 times in the earlier matchup when Carrasco was pitching, though Kipnis was 0-4 in the season opener vs Keuchel.   More Hits, Runs, RBI: Altuve (-125) vs Brantley (-105). I would have taken Altuve. For one, /u/j3rown can see Altuve having a good game. Both hitters were 0-4 in their earlier games when the opposing pitchers started.

Basically there are a few ways to play this game. The pick em (DNB) line is +110 and I put a large stake on that, but since a draw is completely probable I think the pk,+1/2 line is more likely to come away with at least a half win.

I love KeSPA cup, the last one was very profitable for me, let's hope for another great tournament! Gonna play some of the DOGS on day 1.    Curious ML over Flash @ 2.00. Curious is a very hot player right now while Flash is struggling with the TvZ matchup. I feel that Curious is just the better player and should be favored to 60-65% even. Favorite play of the day. 3U  San ML over soO @ 3.2. Both players are the kind of players that easily get tilted after a loss. San historically is excellent in PvZ while it remains soO has been inconsistent in the matchup. In his credit, soO has been on a upswing lately and the odds reflect this as he is warming up on a possible return to 2014 form. 48/52 matchup leaning towards soO, I'll hit up the underdog! 2U  Jjajki MLover herO @ 5.4. GROSS mispricing. herO will LIKELY win but jjajki is valued only to 18%. I'd give this match a 65-35 in favor of herO. 1U   Fantasy ML over Dark @ 3.3. Dark is a better player and has a total mastery of this matchup, Fantasy is no slouch either. Likely the end result will be 3-1 Dark but I feel that odds are mispriced against Fantasy grossly.

Overcast day game. Jungmann hasn’t been tested and scouts I trust are very down on his ability to pitch in majors. Reds lineup gives him a serious challenge. Leake is below average and only keeping it together thanks to a lucky BABIP. Lucroy teed off on him last year. Don’t trust his recent turnaround, it came vs teams like MIN, MIA, and PHI (2x) in June.      LAA -120  Wilson typically dominates lefties (struggling a bit this year, but career .260 wOBA vs them for career). We’ve seen time and again that the Rangers struggle when they face pitchers who can shut down their big left handed bats. Colby Lewis is terrible. Sometimes it’s that straightforward."

Betting 5Dimes overnight lines, a coin-flipping bettor has roughly a -1.2% ""edge.""  This was the first day since I began tracking the model that I did not at least improve upon that.  That -1.44% EV on yesterday's wagers means it was a bad day with a lucky result. For example, I bet the Tigers -122 and the line closed -104 at Pinnacle. That's just not a good bet. If you make those types of bets, you will hemorrhage money in the long run. The fact that the Tigers won the game is a one game sample that means next to nothing. The liquid betting market's evaluation of the odds of each team winning the Tigers game, on the other hand, is not subject to luck and variance like a baseball game. Let's hope I return to the norm of beating the vig-free close today."

On Bovada, over 9 runs is -115, and TOR Total Runs over 4.5 is also -115. I'm thinking it makes more sense to take the TOR Total Runs over 4.5 than the over 9 for the game.

sportsbook,3c5nrz,madsports66,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:35:53 2015 UTC,"So far, we're both right! :) I wasn't necessarily trusting the Jays to be the ones to put up the runs. I figured if they got blown out but made a late rally we'd still probably cover the 9 or even 9.5"
sportsbook,3c5nrz,bobby_racket,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:25:39 2015 UTC,"I'm going with the o9 too. Both sides have had their fair share of high scoring games as of late (Not counting the current series, out of Detroit's last 10 games, 7 have been 10 runs or more, with the other 3 being 9 run affairs and they proved they could do it without Miggy. Toronto has been 4/10 o10 runs recently.) With a line around -105 this pick is a beauty. A nice little toss in would be Houston ML at +105 for a pretty 2 team parlay or a nice hedge.

sportsbook,3c5nrz,hesbunky,6,Sun Jul 5 10:25:50 2015 UTC,"Low air density only really produces major offense numbers when pitchers throw a large percentage of fastballs. Both Erv and Duffy throw a ton of offspeed stuff and the low air density might actually help the movement on those pitches. Not a terrible bet, but just because the Twins are better vs lefties than they are vs righties, it doesn't mean they are strong against them (16th wOBA in league vs LHP | 23rd in league vs RHP)"
sportsbook,3c5nrz,EL_Apostrophe,2,Sun Jul 5 14:51:09 2015 UTC,God dammit. Already written this up as an L now. As a follow up - where do you research pitch types? Fangraphs?

sportsbook,3c5nrz,EL_Apostrophe,2,Sun Jul 5 15:14:02 2015 UTC,"Awesome. So, I've learned from you that fastball pitchers do worse at lower air densities - is the converse true, where offspeed pitchers tend to do worse at higher air densities?"
sportsbook,3c5nrz,hesbunky,8,Sun Jul 5 15:28:34 2015 UTC,Which is why the entire Red Sox front office should be canned immediately. Anyone who follows this shit as closely as I do knew right away that loading up on pitchers who do poorly in high air density conditions would be a disaster in Boston weather. I predicted this exact outcome for them: Suck at start of season when air density in New England is real high. Fool everyone into thinking they might be ok from mid-June through August. Go back to sucking when the weather turns in September.   It's shocking to me that they employ so many advanced statistical analysts yet blew it this badly. I am actually supposed to meet Ben Cherington in August. Hopefully he still has the GM job by then so I can share my thoughts on this.

sportsbook,3c5pxo,stander414,5,Sun Jul 5 01:44:24 2015 UTC,"NA LCS W6 D2  Current Blue Side/Red Side Stats: 28-27 51%  Current Fan Vote Stats: 41-14 (LCS site fan poll) 74%      All odds based off https://nitrogensports.eu/r/414 Very accurate lines today.  Everything seems to have settled. If you were in KiK chat, hopefully you got in early on some of these matches. I will analyze current odds.  A lot of instances today where odds are better some places than others so make sure to check around before you bet.       Enemy Esports 2.73 over Team Dragon Knights 1.4 - Enemy blue side/TDK fan vote.  The new TDK roster is looking good.  Beating Dignitas in their debut (Dig didn't really know what to expect), and giving TSM a run in their second game together.  Enemy has looked mediocre recently, with their last win being over a gimped Cloud 9. If TDK is for real (I think they are) they should handle Enemy easily.  However I can see this game going to late game with Enemy having a chance to close out.  Enemy has looked ok in some of their games, gaining early leads but throwing them late.  Their game yesterday looked horrible on paper but they just lost one big team fight early, which snowballed the game for Impulse.  If they can avoid major mistakes like that, they have a chance to stay with TDK.  All that being said, if you got TDK anywhere above 1.4 you have a lot of value.  However at 2.7+, I think there's value on Enemy as well.  I am going to skip at current odds.  I will be keeping an eye on it however and putting some more on TDK if it goes 1.5+ or a bit on Enemy if it goes 2.8+.        Impulse 2.35 over Counter Logic Gaming 1.55 - CLG blue side/fan vote.  Ah the classic CLG tilt is upon us.  Unfortunately here I am not sure we can take advantage of it.  As much as I like betting against CLG at this point, I do not think that Impulse offers enough value here.  Impulse is a wild bunch, constantly fighting without much ""strategy"".  Coming off a win yesterday against Enemy they'll be very confident to go into every fight they see.  CLG should be able to prepare for them as with a good pick/ban is somewhat easy to counter a full team fight comp.  I could see CLG getting Runeglaive Ezreal in this game and building a comp to get him to late game.  If Impulse can't get ahead super early, I see this game going over to CLG after a hardfought mid game.  Again, odds are very accurate here.  If you can get Impulse over 2.5 (vitalbet is at 2.58), I believe that is your play.  I would stay away from CLG unless it moves closer to 1.7ish.  skip at current odds.       Team Solo Mid 1.55 over Gravity 2.35 - TSM blue side/fan vote.  I loved Gravity at 2.8+ but the odds seem to have corrected.  TSM has an edge in this game in my opinion.  Of course Gravity beat TSM earlier in the season but I fully believe TSM is back in control of their fate.  Their pick/bans have been going well and they have been playing their comps well.  Yesterday they snagged Ezreal and while they got behind early/mid game (to be expected with their comp) they brought it back late game. Another factor is it looks like Wildturtle is starting again today. Honestly at this point it doesn't seem to matter who is at adc but I will say they have more games under their belt with wildturtle so the unknown factor is gone at least with turtle in there.  Once again you just need to play the odds on this game.  If you can get TSM 1.6+, I'd go TSM but Gravity at 2.8+ is a great play as well.  I put this game at 60/40 in favor of TSM.  skip at current odds.       Dignitas 2.27 over Team Liquid 1.6 - Dignitas blue side/Liquid fan vote.  Finally a match I believe I can give you a clear bet on.  Dig beat Team Liquid earlier this split.  Going back and watching this game, it was extremely close.  I believe Dig has only improved since then while I would say Liquid has actually regressed a little bit since then.  I believe this will be another close match with a slight edge for Dignitas.  I believe Helios offers them great leadership and experience.  55/45 in favor of Dignitas giving us nice value on Dignitas.  3 units Dignitas.       Cloud 9 1.51 vs.  Team 8 2.43 - Team 8 blue side/Cloud 9 fan vote.  I'm on board the Hai wagon.  They looked drastically improved yesterday.  I believe this Team 8 game is where they show a little bit of the old Cloud 9 we expect.  Great map control, rotations, and objective trading.  Team 8 unfortunately is just ready for that level of play and will be left behind.  This is another game where I believe there's still a little value in Cloud 9 here.  It should be more around 1.4.  4 units Cloud 9.       https://twitter.com/esportsbettor     http://www.cappertek.com/picks.asp?shs=ESportsBettor.cappertek.com&lastDays=180&sport=ALL#history   107-87  +81 units, 11% ROI over 194 picks     Join us at /r/esportsbook and /r/sportsbook     stander414 on KiK if anyone wants to chat esports"
sportsbook,3c5pxo,Benwadabeast,2,Sun Jul 5 13:54:58 2015 UTC,"Vulcun-NA LCS W6D2        Lineup:  Top-Hauntzer  Jungle-Kez  Mid-Incarnation  ADC-Emperor  Support-Lemonnation  Flex-Sneaky  Flex-Ninja  Flex-Bjergsen     Explanation This week is relatively simple, that doesn't mean its easy just a lot of options.  The two games that I think will be juicy with points will be C9 vs T8 and NME vs TDK.  The stats say just about every player on each of these teams has good value.  Personally I think TDK and C9 will be the winners and therefore am picking from those teams more heavily, though I may make another roster ignoring who I believe will be winners and just going all in on one game.  For this roster the revitalized C9 with their fearless leader back in the roster will be a 3 stack.  Sneaky has always been the best player on that team and now that they seem to remember how to win I think he will flaunt all over T8.  Incarnation is the primary carry and you can not avoid him if you are expecting cloud 9 to go big.  Lemon is a good plug at support as he is cheap and you expect him to do well if Sneaky does, also T8 gives up on average 23 pts to opposing supports, thats plenty for $977.  Next game to focus on is NME vs TDK.  Before the return of the korean duo I would've gone heavy NME but this TDK team looks like an actual team now and they have some talent.  They played TSM quite well yesterday and I expect both Ninja and Emperor to tear NME up.  I think NME can keep it together long enough for TDK to gather some solid fantasy points.  Kez is my third TDK player as I assume he will a part of Ninja getting ahead in the mid lane and early skirmishes that TDK love.  Ninja would be the TDK player with the least of my confidence as NME is incredibly good at keeping mid laners down.  They only give up 6.87% more fpts to opposing mid laners than the LCS avg.  With all this value I spent money on high projectors like Bjergsen and in desperate need of a top I went with Hauntzer. Gravity beat TSM earlier and as I have said the last few weeks, GRV have the most consistent players across the board fantasy performance wise.  Again all 4 teams involved in the two battle for bottom bitch games are loaded with value but in volatile games like these always go with players on winning teams and TDK and C9 are my winners.     Top 5 Projected Scorers  -Emperor  -Innox  -Bjergsen  -Nien  -Trashy  Top 5 Value Players  -Emperor  -Trashy  -Innox  -Nien  -Goldenglue        Thanks for reading and play safe this week, 50/50s and Double Ups all day.

It all depends if Lilbow is going to do that 2 base all-in timing that he loves, or try and play macro. I feel he has more chance winning if he goes macro, but we shall see.  I also like PartinG -1.5, Sacscri hasn't impressed me with his PvZ, losing to Patience and then beating him 2-1. PartinG is on a whole different level. This should be 3-0."

sportsbook,3c1wfu,TheCocksmith,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:56:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Those are determined by the Kelly criterion which is very popular amongst professional gamblers and some investors.  Based on the odds offered and your estimated chances of winning the bet (which in my case is whatever win% I project for the team I'm betting), the Kelly criterion tells you the optimal amount of your bankroll you should risk in order to maximize the size of your bankroll in the long run.   Most bettors from what I have read are more conservative than full Kelly and instead bet some fraction of Kelly. Right now I have it at 1/10th Kelly, which is very low, for the reasons stated here."

LOSS  I feel that this match is a 60-40 in favored of Fnatic, so gonna abuse some odds. Virtus Pro has shown this LAN that they are the most prepared team coming into the tournament aside from C9. They took every match 100% seriously and in interviews said that they had studied every matchup even against the ""walkover""(surprise!) NA teams. Fnatic usually beats VP in series and probably didn't practice anything special for VP, relying on their general understanding of their matchup dynamic. If VP is able to change things up and make the adjustments against Fnatic(which I have a feeling they have) I see the upset potential being very high.   Will likely also bet VP +3.5/+4.5 round spread on each specific map. VP will make things very competitive but I don't expect them to take the match in the end.  Leans but not betting:   C9 ML over CLG 4U or SKIP for me"

sportsbook,3c2dza,heyoalison,2,Sat Jul 4 07:28:06 2015 UTC,"I'm still a bit wary of this one. Hai obviously isn't going to lack synergy with the team, and with better shot calling C9 could be more like their old selves. Also don't think Meteos had been playing very well so the potential drop off might not be there.   I dunno, I think it's potentially riskier than people are making out."

The best teams for stacking were incredibly expensive and there were no great value buys.  I ended up grabbing supports from good teams to save money.  Dig is going against T8,  I say it every week but T8 gives up points win or lose.  Dignitas has started to look shaky but I still think this is a win for them and  Gamsu and Kiwikid should do well.  TSM is the team that you would want to stack going up against TDK but there are two reasons to avoid this.  One is they are too expensive and going with 2-3 TSM leave you with very little support in the rest of your roster.  Two is that TSM has developed the ability to win through map pressure and rotations avoiding fights and winning cleanly which is bad for fantasy.  Santorin is still a good pick because the kills they do get will probably be from early skirmishes and ganks that Santorin should always be a part of.  Dyrus at face value is a good pick but I'm afraid he may split push a lot.  Apollo/Adrian going against NME is probably my favorite duo of the day, they are very consistent players and TiP has looked pretty solid.  Keane is my plug at mid, he has a pretty hard match-up against CLG but CLG has looked shaky and I think GRV can play it close if not win.  Even though Keanes value isn't great I bought him for his consistency(CV=.25), hoping for some security in mid lane for a decent price.  Xpecial is plugged in flex because of his price, 3 supports is normally not smart but in the end it just comes down to points per dollar and Xpecial going against C9 definitely has that.  Nien was the only player I felt okay with placing in the last flex at the salary I had left.  He is horribly inconsistent and lets hope today is one of the high reward days, either way for $937 it won't be hard to get your moneys worth with him.     Top 5 Projected Scorers  -Bjergsen  -Santorin  -Apollo  -Dyrus  -Gamsu  Top 5 Value Players  -Kiwi  -Santorin  -Adrian  -Xpecial  -Dyrus        Thanks for reading and play safe this week, 50/50s and Double Ups all day.

sportsbook,3c2dza,MouMoneyMouProblem,2,Sat Jul 4 15:13:26 2015 UTC,"NA LCS W6 D1  Current Blue Side/Red Side Stats: 26-24 52%  Current Fan Vote Stats: 37-13 (LCS site fan poll) 74%      Enemy 3.28 over Team Impulse 1.36 - Impulse blue side/fan vote.  These teams met in Week 4.  It resulted in a 35 minute win for Impulse.  What this does show is that Enemy was leading up until about the 21 minute point, where a team fight didn't quite go their way and the gold lead went back to Impulse.  This team fight allowed Impulse to get ahead in turrets and objective control.  Of course, this is how League of Legends works but the thing is, Enemy controlled the early game which is usually Impulse's thing.  If Enemy can just not take a poor teamfight this time, they have a really good shot at winning this game.  Looking at their first game, it is hard to give Impulse anymore of an edge than 60/40.  This gives us very nice value on Enemy.  3 units on Enemy.       Team Solo Mid 1.25 over Team Dragon Knights 3.78 - TDK blue side/TSM fan vote.  I believe this should be more around 1.1 for TSM.  Look, Team Solo Mid is 8-2 this split.  They are arguably the best team in NA right now.  They've dropped games to Cloud 9 Week 1, and Dignitas.  They should not have an issue with TDK today.  It can be argued that now TDK has their roster and that they beat Dignitas but Dignitas was just completely caught off guard.  TSM will has had a week to prepare for TDK and will be using Keith in the game.  Keith is going to put his all into this game to prove he belongs in the LCS.  From the little we saw of Keith on Team Liquid, we know he has what it takes.  I like this for 4 units as I am not convinced by the one win by TDK.       Team Liquid 1.39 over Cloud 9 2.85 - Cloud 9 blue side/Liquid fan vote.  Of course probably the most interesting match of today.  Hai, former C9 mid laner, will be making an ""emergency"" start in the jungle instead of Meteos.  Due to this last minute change, Cloud 9 will lose bans.  Hopefully if you check these threads daily, you were able to hop on Liquid at 1.6 earlier this week.  If not, 1.4 is still a decent deal here.  Hai could very well be an improvement for C9 due to his shotcalling but against a team like Liquid, they will most likely have a lot of trouble.  Combined with the fact that this seems to be a last minute change and the loss of bans, Liquid is a safe bet here.  Liquid have their sights set on worlds while at this point Cloud 9 is just trying to avoid relegation.  I wouldn't even be surprised to see Cloud 9 doing some off meta picks and messing around a little bit this game.  I do not think they expect to have a shot here.  8 units Team Liquid       Gravity 2.53 over Counter Logic Gaming 1.48 - CLG blue side/fan vote. It's that time of the split again boys, FADE CLG time.  Of course with Gravity on the otherside of the match up, this is an easy fade.  Both teams sit at 7-3 and both teams have looked great and mediocre this split.  CLG though has straight up looked bad in some games.  Gravity on the other hand is still in the building process with new jungler Move. Move has shown that he is a good addition to the team, playing support junglers very well.  A worry I have for him is that he will one day have to play some carry jungle roles. He has yet to show he is capable of doing this.  Today however, I believe he will be able to play support jungle and bring his team the win.  CLG has had issues with Xmithie and there have been rumors that Meteos may end up on CLG.  I put this game at 50/50 because if both teams play to their full potential, they are pretty much even.  The key however is that CLG is notorious for not playing at their full potential, giving Gravity the edge and value here.  3 units Gravity.       Dignitas 1.33 vs.  Team 8 3.23 - Dignitas blue side/fan vote.  Dignitas will be looking to redeem themselves from their loss to TDK.  I'm sure everyone is having PTSD but I once again believe Dignitas will win here.  Helios is actually a very good leader and Dignitas is not the type of team to lose a ton of morale over a tough loss.  Shiphtur and Kiwi have been through much, much worse.  So has Helios.  They'll dismantle Team 8 today with Gamsu rolling them over on a carry top.  4 units on Dignitas.      https://twitter.com/esportsbettor     http://www.cappertek.com/picks.asp?shs=ESportsBettor.cappertek.com&lastDays=180&sport=ALL#history   103-85  +77 units, 11% ROI over 188 picks     Join us at /r/esportsbook and /r/sportsbook     stander414 on KiK if anyone wants to chat esports"

There's too much value on SKT at 1.80(bet365) to pass up on a team who didn't lose during the original season, even if it was under a different format. Their team as a whole is definitely stronger, but Maru is once again the big danger."
sportsbook,3c2dza,TheSpooneh,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:03:35 2015 UTC,"For sure, JAGW as a team has looked weaker than JAGW of the past 2-3 SPL rounds.

Jin Air is actually the only team to have upset this pattern (twice I believe)."

sportsbook,3bzke3,pidgey121,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:40:59 2015 UTC,It's definitely not going to rain tomorrow (unlike /u/547984 says). It's actually going to be very hot (for Dutch standards). It's a very short stage in one of the most dense cities in the Neterlands. I have a small bet on Tony Dumoulin because he is a proud Dutch and this would be a wonderful win with all his fellow Dutchmen supporting him.   Route of Stage 1

The koreans look like they are giving 100% but some of the foreigners are just doing stupid shit and look like they dont care that much about winning, makes my strategy of almost exclusively underdogs not very good.   I think I am gonna pick EVERY SINGLE Zerg underdog in ZvP all tournament. This map pool is just fucking atrocious, and as we saw with targa vs parting yesterday, zergs can take maps off much better players due to back rocks and other bullshit (fwiw i had targa +1.5 at 3.66 odds :D)"
sportsbook,3bxsml,Benwadabeast,3,Fri Jul 3 13:04:09 2015 UTC,"Vulcun-EU LCS W6D2        Lineup:  Top-Fredy122  Jungler-Jankos  Mid-Pepiinero  ADC-Hjarnan  Support-Godfred  Flex-Adryh  Flex-Rekkles  Flex-Candypanda     Explanation:This one was tough, the value picks left you with too much money and the highest projections didn't have great value.  SK as a whole played decent against ROCCAT and yet again they gave up a lot of fantasy points.  Yesterday taking both ROCC and SK was the smart choice, at risk of being one step behind I'm going to take some Giants and some SK hoping for another high kill back and forth game like yesterdays.  Giants are the ones with the most value this week as SK is well above the LCS average at giving up fpts to all positions but they have looked good so I don't feel super confident.  Nonetheless I'm going to have faith in the stats and go Godfred, Adryh and Pepiinero with Pepii as my shotcaller.  If they can play Fnatic that close(even if Fnatic was a little off) I think they will fair fine against a middle of the pack SK team.  Vice versa, I'm picking Candy and Fredy from SK mostly because of how cheap they are.  If you feel confident in SK you could swap nRated in for Godfred as they are both absurdly cheap.  After getting the value in Giants vs SK I spent big money on Rekkles and Hjarnan.  I picked these two because they are consistent, Rekkles having the lowest CV of all ADCs and Hjarnan not far behind at 2nd.  What this means is their ceiling might not be massive but there is a much lower chance that they will perform like Niels did today. Speaking of Origen players there are a few who are high projection with decent value but yesterday scared me, they are incredibly bad from behind and Elements is just decent enough that they could do what UoL did.  I will most likely still be playing one roster with Origen players in for my high salary spots.  Jankos is a plug at jungle solely because of his value, I think Gambit vs Roccat should be a decent game and Jankos has played well so for $1,156 he is my jungler.  This roster is much more scattered than normal, I spent a lot of time wavering back and forth on certain spots so I encourage you to look at the Top 5s and if you lean a different way than me today don't doubt yourself.  I see value in Gambit and Roccat players as well but the stats don't agree so I'm not suggesting them.     Top 5 Projected Scorers  -Niels  -Pepii  -Adryh  -sOaz  -Rekkles  Top 5 Value Players  -G0dfred  -Fredy122  -Adryh  -Werlyb  -Pepii        Thanks for reading and play safe this week, 50/50s and Double Ups all day.

sportsbook,3bxsml,MouMoneyMouProblem,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:45:47 2015 UTC,hey I'm just curious but how is vulcan compared to other sportsbooks in terms of potential earnings and how is the risk/reward compared to just ML bets?  this page from their site looks hilariously sketchy   https://vulcun.com/main/winnings
sportsbook,3bxsml,skeptical_views,2,Fri Jul 3 04:39:41 2015 UTC,those pics lol
sportsbook,3bxsml,skeptical_views,2,Fri Jul 3 04:58:26 2015 UTC,"Yea those pics have little to no verification as far as I know, they may be ignoring all the money they spent on entry fees and just listing their winnings lol.  I think the winnings are very VERY dependent on what you are willing to put in. Playing a lot of different rosters and big money contests hoping to hit the big one seems to be the general strategy.  I am playing the averages hoping to just slowly gain money entering bigger and bigger contests.  As far as compared to ML betting it probably is not as lucrative but in my opinion it is a lot more fun.  Playing a Vulcun lineup can make watching TDK vs T8 a lot more exciting.  Also I think the risk is lower because you are playing against other people not against the odds.  All you need to do is be smarter than a certain percent of people in your contest."

TL are @ 1.5 to beat C9, is this worth hitting hard? The thing that makes me question it slightly is whether having Hai shot call will make up for the rest."

Rochester and Charleston are the top two teams in the eastern conference but have very different styles. Charleston is an offensively powered team while Rochester is the best defensive team in the league by far, only conceding 5 goals over 14 games (seriously, that's insane!).   Despite Charleston's high powered offense, they've so far struggled to score against good defensive teams. Their games against the 2nd and 3rd best defensive teams in the league both ended in 1-1 ties, and those teams aren't even close to as good defensively as Rochester.  Even overall on the season, Charleston has stayed under 2.5 on 8 out of their 15 games (53%) while Rochester has stayed under 2.5 on 11 out of 14 (79%). The line at -150 is pretty dead on, but unless there's an anomaly here I don't see this going for more than two goals.

I agree, I think the Cards should win this...but a few things:  Cardinals seem to be going into a little 'slump' lately with their bats. I figured the Padres would get destroyed here but there is a chance they caught St. Louis at the right time especially with all their injuries.  San Diego has their backs to the wall and a bad series/road trip would pretty much be the end of the season. This team got booed off the field Tuesday night after being shut out again, they have to show something here or its time to start trading away players.    Yeah Andrew Cashner is 3-9 with a 4.22 ERA, but he's better than that. He pitched well in April/May, going into June with a 3.00 ERA but a losing record due to no run support and getting hit with all sorts of BS unearned runs. Then June came and he was a complete disaster (6.55 ERA in June), very hard to watch......until his last start against Arizona.  Wacha has the advantage but Cashner has the talent to shut down the Cards when he is on his game.  On Bovada I saw the Cardinals at -175 last night...right now it is at -156 yet 83% are on St. Louis.........hmmmmmm!  AND    You used the word ""lock""  :)"

sportsbook,3bwqfo,FrozenFlamethrower,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:13:46 2015 UTC,"You can manipulate fangraphs to get a bit of the data that you want.  For example, here, I've selected the ground ball percentages of batted balls.  Now, that won't tell you a full story, since an AB can end with walk, hit, HR, etc, but it gives you a good idea if you combine the strikeouts, walks, GB and FB, H and BB statistics together to get a pitcher's dismissal tally, and work from there.  Now, personally, I don't have access to this since I don't use Bovida, but it is interesting. For now, I wouldn't touch it, because there are a lot more variables that how a pitcher handles a AB. If you want success from this, you will more than likely have to go into a batter's statistics as well, and find out their AB performance, and their trend.   You can even get more complicated by taking into account the park it's played in (difference between a HR and a FB/Out), leverage situation (you might want to play Goldschmidt to get walked with you have someone at base, Dbags trailing in the 9th). Might imagine you want to ignore the whole bullpen because of how much work you would have to do.   TL:DR, Fangraphs has a lot of the data you are looking for, too much effort in my opinion to actively work."
sportsbook,3bwqfo,547984,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:07:12 2015 UTC,I think Keuchel leads the league in ground balls by a large margin. Though I would imagine they have already adjusted for that.

sportsbook,3btiow,thegreat8,2,Thu Jul 2 17:35:58 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna say no (though I don't speak for /u/CheeseAddiction) .. I haven't run any numbers, I just have a hunch that we've seen somewhat of a statistical anomaly the last few weeks. Not to take anything away from /u/CheeseAddiction, not only is he exploiting an inefficiency in the MLB gambling market, but he's finding the most exploitable lines within the already exploitable market. Really one of the most impressive runs I've ever seen.  That being said, 1) There have been several days where nearly every game ends up as a ""No"". That will not continue indefinitely. 2) If it does (we are in kind of a modern-day dead ball era), the market will correct itself. Which might be what we are already seeing. Lines on my book were a bit pricier today as well.   I don't have any hard data for you, but -170 would be about the most I'd be willing to pay and that's if you've got 2 aces with good first inning #'s on the mound.  Honestly it might seem unlikely that /u/CheeseAddiction single-handedly caused a global sports betting market correction, but I think it's possible. There's one person on here who's run his account up to $20K ... Even one guy like that betting all first inning props over the course of a couple weeks, the book (which happened to be Bovada) will take notice and start running some numbers. On top of that, there's probably at least 50-100 others on here tailing him. All hail /u/CheeseAddiction !! I hope it continues but I'm afraid we might start seeing some increased vig."
sportsbook,3btiow,whorunit,3,Thu Jul 2 18:12:41 2015 UTC,The obvious solution is to start betting for runs TO BE HIT in the 1st inning instead!
sportsbook,3btiow,TheSpooneh,2,Thu Jul 2 18:38:48 2015 UTC,"No. Lines are made that high for a reason - because it will very likely hit. It would basically be throwing your money away to bet against a -170 line for this prop because that usually only comes up with 2 aces on the mound. However, I generally try not to take lines that steep because even the best pitcher can make 1 bad pitch to allow a run to score and while these bets have been very profitable lately, they are still massively unpredictable."

sportsbook,3btiow,CheeseAddiction,12,Thu Jul 2 04:38:38 2015 UTC,"Day games are lower scoring on average than night games. This is almost entirely due to the sunlight making it difficult to pick up the release of the pitch (glare, shadows, etc).

Either way, you'll probably notice higher vig on day game ""no 1st inning runs"" because the fact that they are lower scoring than night games is pretty well known."

I'm curious as to your thinking on the Giants game, since that was the second one that I didn't play. I saw 2 pitchers coming off the DL, which is a sign of concern since they haven't played this year in the big leagues.

sportsbook,3btiow,BaseballModeler,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:05:19 2015 UTC,"Any Insight as to why the model has the Rangers vs Baltimore game as priced correctly ? I just can't find any reason Baltimore should be favored. Since May 13th only one team has managed to put up 5 runs in a game that Yovanni started, it was Oakland and they scored exactly 5. Posted a write up above. On top of that, the Orioles have a .103 team batting average against him over 58 AB's (granted not a huge sample size, but enough that I'd consider it significant)."
sportsbook,3btiow,whorunit,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:43:20 2015 UTC,"You make some good points in your post. ZiPS and Steamer still see Gallardo as a true talent ~4 RA9 pitcher despite his recent strong performance, so that's part of the reason the model does not favor the Rangers. In his short MLB career, Gausman has a SIERA in the low 4's and Steamer actually projects him to be significantly better than Gallardo going forward. Maybe there is something real about Gallardo's recent performance that the eye test can catch but a projection system cannot.    As far as the Orioles lack of success against Gallardo, I don't factor that in at all.  It's possible Gallardo has the Orioles' number but I have yet to see any research that says 60 or so ABs of BvP data is meaningful at the player level, much less the team level.  This is a good article about BvP data and it also references ""The Book"" which is a fantastic read for any baseball bettor or fan.  What I do factor in is that the Orioles lineup as a whole projects to perform much better against right-handers overall (though as you noted the same could be said for the Rangers lineup against Gausman).  Not only is Gallardo right-handed but all of their best bullpen arms are righties as well. Another thing working against the Rangers in the model, as you said in your post, is their bullpen which I have about a half a run worse per 9 innings than the Orioles.  Put it all together, add in home field advantage, and I see the current market number as correct.  Hope I'm wrong!"
sportsbook,3btiow,BaseballModeler,2,Thu Jul 2 04:53:56 2015 UTC,The fact that any model projects Gaussman as a better pitcher than Gallardo tonight is exactly why 99% of models are worthless.
sportsbook,3btiow,EL_Apostrophe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:37:25 2015 UTC,"Well I hope I can get into that 1 percent! I'm not too offended because the inputs of the model driving that determiation are mainly widely available projection systems.  Whether my model is useless still remains to be seen, it may very well be.  It has beaten the vig-free closing line through its first 89 picks since I started tracking, which I think you will agree is a great sign of a profitable approach.  Whether that will continue certainly remains to be seen, and I'll be the first to admit my model still has huge room for improvement.   But either way, if the projection of the relative strength of those two pitchers is wrong, all hate mail should be directed to Jared Cross of Steamer Projections which for some reason is very high on Gausman. ZiPS has Gallardo slightly better than Gausman."
sportsbook,3btiow,BaseballModeler,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:10:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the response. That was very informative.  Gausman is a great talent, I think he'll be in the league a long time, but he's still raw. I am expecting the healthy Rangers to knock him around.   As for Gallardo, can't argue with ZiPS and Steamer. I noticed when looking through some of his pitch metrics he's throwing the slider and change more. His O-Contact% is up 9 percentage points from his career average - he's getting guys to make contact with bad pitches more often as opposed to having them swing and miss, but I think it's actually working to his advantage. Fewer Fastballs seems to = Fewer K's. Coincidentally his Slider% is also up 9 percentage points. He's striking out less batters, but his GB% is the highest it's ever been and his Fly-Ball% is the lowest it's ever been. All of those things I mentioned, there's only one other season where the numbers in those categories are similar - it was 2008. He only pitched in 4 games but he had a 1.88ERA over that very small sample size.  So I guess it's kind of inconclusive. There are definitely things he's doing differently, I just can't quite piece them together / figure out why they're working. The GB% is the most odd part, because the slider isn't really known as a GB pitch. I have only watched him the one time this year. He's letting guys make contact more often, and they're hitting more ground balls (which gives some creditability to the lower .BABIP -- might be more sustainable than it would seem at first glance). He's mixing up his pitches quite a bit more, throwing a lot more sliders. The changes are there, the question is will they continue to work or will guys figure him out."

sportsbook,3btiow,BaseballModeler,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:25:44 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the support man -- to be fair though we were both right -- Gallardo just has it right now, he was great - I actually watched this game though and his stock dropped a little in my book ... His pitches have great movement but the O's were hitting the ball hard. The BABIP luck in this one was pretty absurd. Leonys Martin is also a beast tracking balls in center.  Gausman was outstanding .. He showed why he was the 4th overall pick a couple years ago.  This game did not go as I'd hoped .. Yovani pitched great but so did Gausman , it became bullpen v bullpen ..I actually turned it off and went out for a beer with my dad after O'day came in and K'd two in a row cuz I was not liking where that was going. 3 beers later I finally decided to check the score and was elated haha. Thanks a lot for your input as I said earlier , Gausman was the superior pitcher tonight in my opinion. His stuff really did look amazing (even though he was throwing way too many fastballs) -- doesn't matter though when they're coming in at 97 with movement. I remember a big problem of his last year was how straight he threw the FB .. Seems like he's got a tiny bit of movement on it now, which is huge when you're throwing that hard.  I will gladly take the W though."
sportsbook,3btiow,whorunit,4,Fri Jul 3 02:09:31 2015 UTC,"Rangers (+115) vs Orioles seems like excellent value to me.   Gallardo is quietly putting together an excellent season. His periphs might suggest some regression at some point, but a lot (more like all) of his FIP/ERA discrepancy (3.46/2.72) is from April/Early May. He's given up only 5 runs in his last 45.1 innings pitched (1.00 ERA). His opponent Caliber is nothing to scoff at either. Royals, A's, Yankees, Red Sox, Dodgers and Blue Jays over his last 9 starts, all top 16 Offenses, and posted a 1.73 ERA during that span. He absolutely torched the Blue Jays his last start, throwing 8.1 scoreless. I actually saw him live from behind home plate on Father's Day against the White Sox, his stuff is looking nasty (granted was against the White Sox). On top of that the current Orioles roster is hitting .103 against him in 58 total ab's  On the other hand we have Gausman. Has yet to prove himself as a SP. Also a hard-throwing right hander which is right up the Rangers' alley. Lineup is back to full health. In the first three games of the series Texas has put up 18 runs -> 6 per game. Yovanii Has given up no more than 4 earned runs the entire year, and that's only happened twice. Both coming very early in the year.   The only downside is Texas bullpen is one of the worst in baseball, which is something to consider, but based on Yovanni's current form and on top of that Baltimore's abysmal history against him, hopefully he can roll deep into the game.  Rangers are very good on the road (25-19) while the Orioles are very good at home (25-15). I think Texas should be favored here based purely on the pitching matchup, I might even argue they should be heavily favored. so I'll gladly take them as dogs.   If there's something I'm missing, feel free to point it out. This line just doesn't really make sense to me at all."
sportsbook,3btiow,whorunit,3,Fri Jul 3 02:46:34 2015 UTC,I like Gallardo as well but his history against Baltimore holds zero predictive value. 58 cumulative ABs is far too small of a sample.
sportsbook,3btiow,Incandenza2015,2,Thu Jul 2 04:27:57 2015 UTC,"58 ABs is wayyyy too small a sample size for BvP stats to mean anything. I'll agree, Gallardo has looked pretty great in his last few starts, but if Gausman can put up at least 5 quality innings and give Baltimore's pen (one of the best in the league right now) the ball without a huge deficit, then the O's have a pretty good shot of winning today."

I expected this line closer to -145 or -150  SD (+130)  Hard to like anything the Padres are doing lately, but this still looked like value to me with a much more accomplished pitcher on the hill.  SEA ML/U7 parlay (+398), 0.5u  I like Kazmir.  I don't think the M's will get a ton off of him, but he doesn't deserve -165 here.  Elias is the wildcard.  He is so hit or miss.  He can get shelled just as easily as he can go out and throw a gem, but I'll take a chance that the good one shows up.  I like the value on the M's, but it's hard for me to envision a ton of scenarios that are high scoring Mariners wins so I'll take a shot.  Add:  MIA (-126) Line move makes this one playable now in my opinion.  With both pitchers coming off injury, I'll take a chance that Fernandez can pick up where he left off at home (12-0, 1.09 ERA, 0.837 WHIP in 20 starts)  Final adds:  CHC/NYM O6 (+102)  Just because.  I know it's 2 good pitchers.  I know some big names are out (Bryant, Fowler), but these teams won't stay this cold.  Pretty neutral conditions at Citi.  Better than even money to go over 6 is like a playoff total, so I'll bite.  Splitting a bet between BAL ML (-117), .5u and BAL -1.5 (+175) for .5u  Another one that becomes playable to me with the line movement.  Obviously Gallardo can't sustain his current run.

Biggest play of the day though is going to be on San Diego Padres. 3% and line moving in favor of St. Louis. Let's get it."

Mendes is fighting on short notice but a complete style change for Conor. It will only stay standing if Mendes wants to.    isnt it like a 10"" reach advantage for Conor too? No way Mendes wants to test his hands when he has his shot for a title wih Aldo on the sidelines"
sportsbook,3brh3x,Badmmagambler,3,Wed Jul 1 15:57:31 2015 UTC,"I believe it's an 8"" reach advantage, and Mendes has said himself that he's going to put Conor on his back."

sportsbook,3brh3x,the-ron,11,Wed Jul 1 23:13:46 2015 UTC,Mendes by wrestlefuck. Easy money.
sportsbook,3brh3x,sc2plzz,4,Wed Jul 1 16:07:08 2015 UTC,"almost too easy.  UFC is so eager to put a fucking belt on Connor's nuts, they've shielded him from wrestlers all this time."
sportsbook,3brh3x,TheCocksmith,5,Wed Jul 1 16:49:56 2015 UTC,"Mendes is ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS in shape and ready to fight.   Check is instagram, anyone that works with him, he is a true UFC fighter. Team Alpha Male does not fuck around, they are smart with their training and have so many great fighters in their camp.  If Mendes is at any point the underdog, it would be foolish not to take him.   Again though, this is the same case as when Mendes fought Aldo (either time for that matter.) Can Conor's takedown defense withhold Chad? Because if it can, Conor has the advantage on the feet without a doubt.  But in this case I don't think he can, Chad will take him down and control the fight.  Conor is a brown belt I believe in BJJ and we will see what he is made of in this fight.   Can't wait."
sportsbook,3brh3x,Sensesmilla,3,Wed Jul 1 16:29:41 2015 UTC,"All signs point to Mendes as the favorite. He's much more experienced, and has never lost a fight except to the current P4P top dog in UFC, Jose Aldo. He is an incredible wrestler, and wrestling particularly is a combat style that is hard for opponents to deal with if they are not themselves experienced in it, since it is so physically draining and non-stop. Chad's team is known for staying in great fighting shape even out of camp, so it's unlikely that he's not fully prepared.  Conor's wrestling ability is the most untested part of his skill-set in his pro career, so this should be a challenge for him. However, with his excellent striking, body control, and fight IQ, Conor is more than just a emperor with no clothes hype-train. Coming into this fight, we really don't know how high his ceiling is. So, I'm still hesitant to bet against Conor, though I think Mendes rightfully should be the favorite, and some books actually have him as a 'dog.   That being said, I might bet the under on rounds, or bet one of these guys to win by KO/TKO. I think either Mendes will totally outclass Conor and KO him quickly, or Conor will show his counter-striking is truly elite, and score a KO. It's possible they go to war for all 5 rounds, but I think with this matchup, it's likely that something's gotta give before then."
sportsbook,3brh3x,WinchestersFinest,3,Wed Jul 1 19:46:25 2015 UTC,This is a really hard matchup for me to call.  Conor obviously has the striking advantage although Mendes has become very good as well.  Mendes will look to use his wrestling and I have no doubt he will get a few takedowns but the question is if he will be able to hold him there.  Conor trains everyday with Gunnar Nelson who is one of the best in the sport in the ground game and even though Conor is untested so far in that aspect I think he will be prepared to fight anywhere.  I have trouble picking a side here but I think this fight plays out similar to the last Aldo/Mendes fight.  I really dont see Mendes getting takedowns at will and he is good enough in the striking department and smart enough to hold his own I think.  In my opinion this will go into the championship rounds and could be a close decision.  I very slightly lean McGregor but the play I like is the over 2.5 rounds @ +110.

sportsbook,3bp29q,zeek_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:23:15 2015 UTC,"Should be no problem. I have a friend who cashed about $35K no issues, though they did spread it out over several payments. They want you to keep it with them as long as possible. I would probably start requesting payments right now if you're at $20K, because I think you can only request ~3K at a time, once per week. They charge a $50 check fee per request, the first one is free, so you could request 3K each week for a month, and collect $11,850 of it. Every check after the first per month has a $50 fee, but at 3K that's only 0.0125% which IMO is quite fair.  Although I guess I don't know how much 20K is to you, for myself it would be a significant enough amount of my net worth that I'd want to start pulling some of it and invest it elsewhere. The money isn't really doing much for you in the bank of Bovada. It also takes like 2 weeks to get a check once you request it, so pulling 4 checks is probably going to take 2 months in total. But if you're betting like $3K per day then different story."

sportsbook,3bp29q,CheeseAddiction,17,Thu Jul 2 04:41:40 2015 UTC,"Only had time to look at the night slate last night. If I get to any of the 4 day games this morning, I will tweet out the plays.     I’m a big fan of the Yankees at plus-money Wednesday night. Angel Stadium is by no means as friendly to New York’s left handed bats as Yankee Stadium, but Matt Shoemaker should make up the difference. Shoemaker struggles against southpaws with a wOBA of .332 and 1.76 HR/9 against that side of the plate this year. The Yankee offense continues to be underappreciated and they are actually red hot at the moment. Over the last 2 weeks, New York owns baseball’s best wOBA and 3rd best ISO. Shoemaker’s recent success is deceiving, as it has come against some pretty shaky offenses (Seattle, Oakland, Tampa, San Diego) but he’s shown the ability to get blown up by better offenses like Houston and Toronto. The Yankees are one of those offenses. Nate Eovaldi isn’t any great shakes either, but his struggles largely come against lefties as well, and the Angels really don’t have any of those. It’s a coin flip game with a underdog price on the team with bigger breakout potential. Yankees +112.     Despite going 7 scoreless his last time out vs this same Braves team, Doug Fister’s fuse is still lit and ready to blow. He lucked into his second lowest BABIP of the year (.200) in the 6/25 start and saw no increase in swinging strike % or velocity. There is no way lightning strikes twice here, I don’t care how bad the Braves offense is. Fister’s prior 3 starts (where he looked awful, allowing 15 runs in 14 innings) came against similarly weak lineups like Tampa, San Diego…and this same Atlanta team. Scouts are positive on Atlanta’s Matt Wisler, but given that he is a rookie, I won’t be going any more than a unit on Atlanta +118, but I can definitely see them winning big.     Pretty text book Over play setting up in Houston Wednesday night. Forecast for low air density. A home offense that is heating up of late (2nd best ISO over last 2 weeks). One pitcher (Volquez) who is pitching way over his head and getting super lucky thanks to a BABIP 40 full points below his career average and some recent scuffles vs decent offenses (e.g. Boston, Milwaukee, Minnesota, Texas). And another pitcher (Velasquez) who as a rookie, has relied heavily on the strikeout but faces a team that simply does not strike out. Wouldn’t be surprised if the KC/HOU Over 8 -105 is covered by the 5th inning without a single HR."

sportsbook,3bp29q,BWSA3,0,Wed Jul 1 17:56:45 2015 UTC,Tijuan's been red hot in june and i'm banking on him to continue his success after overcoming his early struggles. Shields does pitch better at home but he's been very hittable the past month so for me it's mostly a matter of hot pitcher vs cold pitcher.

sportsbook,3bp29q,duncanbishop24,3,Wed Jul 1 10:48:43 2015 UTC,"Hey all--I have had great success making my picks based off of where the money is and closely watching line movements. Yesterday I rode the Astros & Marlins quite heavily to win some cheese (shoutout to u/EL_Apostrophe as I tailed pirates in a parlay with the above two and USA women). If I see anything that stands out to me, I'll be sure to post it. For some of the more seasoned bettors--how successful have numbers been for you? Keep in mind I don't take into consideration factors like who's pitching or weather."
sportsbook,3bp29q,_ugardii_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:03:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I blindly bet RLM when the public is on 88%+ other side. Works pretty good. You end up relying on a lot of home dogs against elite pitching. Just need to stick with it and not get frustrated when you back shitty teams and they play shitty."
sportsbook,3bp29q,Incandenza2015,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:16:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed--its tough fading intuition but it can pay off in the proper scenarios (i.e. I played Heat ML as dogs against Cavs late this season. It was a multi-unit play that had me itching until it hit... 4% of money WIN). Last week I was on some serious dogs that I rode solely because of where the money was (Phillies, Reds, Brewers) and killed it. Today, Vegas is pointing to:  Oakland ML Nationals-Braves Under 7.5 Cleveland-Tampa Under 7"

sportsbook,3bp29q,skeptical_views,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:27:51 2015 UTC,I'd really love to know where you get your info from because it seems that we're turning up different results.   I'm not seeing a huge percent of the money (only 57%) on the padres but the line going from (-128 to -105) definitely jumps out at me. Conversely i'm not seeing anything in the oakland game which indicates reverse line movement - can you elaborate on what you use and what you see in the oakland game that you like?
sportsbook,3bp29q,N2060,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:57:03 2015 UTC,"These are my bets. I use www.vegasinsider.com. My downfall is that when I see early line movements that indicate data in my favor, I take that bet and ride it out... I should wait longer till around gametime. The A's line has been very odd--this morning >80% was on the Rockies which, as dogs, Vegas would lose a lot on the game... and line was moving in Col's favor. It closed with money at about 50/50. 1% of the money is currently on Braves under and the line has seemed to freeze at 7.5."
sportsbook,3bp29q,ugardii,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:04:20 2015 UTC,"Alright that makes sense - I used vegasinsider when looking at some NBA lines and noticed two things: - They get their odds from sportsbook.ag and personally I've never heard somebody mention that they use it. It's usually 5dimes or bovada or bet365 etc. This makes me wonder how reliable their numbers are in gauging the communities perspective on the game. - For NBA lines it would always update about 5-10 minutes after the game had started so you may go from 60 percent of the money on one side, to 55 which may change how you bet the game. For me personally I didn't like not being able to have this information locked in before the game.  I use covers.com to look at stuff like this and it does have some potential pitfalls as well but it meets my personal needs. It doesn't actually gauge how much money is on a side, but takes a consensus of all users on the site to determine how many people are on each team. At the end of the day I think it gets an accurate picture of what the public thinks in terms of being on a side but others might disagree.  The one thing that I really like about covers though is that the opening odds are shown on the same page so it's all easy to read and figure out where the RLM is at. Also it uses odds from pinnaclesports I believe which is a sharp book, due to it's higher betting limits that nearly every other book i've been on."

sportsbook,3bp29q,feedmysole,2,Wed Jul 1 14:28:49 2015 UTC,"Current perception has Porcello under-valued and Buehrle over-valued. Peripherals/advanced metrics suggest that Porcello has really only pitched poorly in 1 of his last 5 starts.  Frankly, despite recent results, I think he's the better pitcher here getting a fairly hefty dog price.  Too much has been made of the Red Sox struggles against LHP.  They have had some bad luck with a .260 BABIP.  Toronto is a great offense, but they are a lot closer to average against RHP than they are against lefties.  Add it all up and it just looks like value to me.  That price gives an implied probability <42% and I just think it's closer to 45% at minimum."

sportsbook,3bpb80,sbpotdbot,16,Wed Jul 1 01:46:33 2015 UTC,"POTD Record 1-1  Alexander Zverev to beat Dennis Kudla @2.20  Zverev is a young and rapidly rising through the ranks, whereas Kudla appears to have plateaued at this level for some time now, Zverev is slightly ahead of Kudla in the rankings.  Kudla has some impressive grass form this season (1 Challenger title and 1 Challenger final loss) however has only played two top 100 players (2 wins) however he has also struggled against top 100 players on all surfaces this year and the two wins were against below average grass court players. Zverev has a winning record against top 100 players this year and has been playing in a higher standard of tournament than Kudla for the grass season (4-3 record all at ATP level) and his losses have come against big servers (Troicki, Karlovic) and Baghdatis who was coming off the back of a straight sets win vs Ferrer.   In my opinion the odds should be the other way around, Kudla @ 2.20 to beat Zverev as Zverev is the better player and has more scope for improvement from his first match. The only question mark I can see will be on whether Zverev can back up from a 5-setter (1st senior level 5 setter was two days ago)."

Do you think there is any possibility of underdogs with a spread -X or greater having better success? Say spreads -10 and up for dogs. I had moderate success betting large spreads for underdogs since a lot of games have garbage points.    Thanks for posting, and great site layout too!"

Agreed that this would be a much better way to measure, but diving in to each game with that much granularity would have been hard given my current resources. I was actually planning on creating a data set for the upcoming season that will include this type of information. Just wondering though, why would there necessarily be a correlation? In theory, a team could go undefeated but lose every game against the spread. For example, in my data set the Lakers won an average of 45.4 games per season, but only averaged 36.6 ATS wins"
sportsbook,3bnlsf,lmtz1511,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:03:59 2015 UTC,Winning and beating the spread are correlated. Basically a team that beats the spread wins more than half the time. Thus two indicators based on them over same sample is correlated.

It's going to take a while before i come up with a good formula to dictate a team strength rating based on some stats i found most beneficial when we tracked our own stats in high school varsity.

sportsbook,3bkl9a,rs1x,10,Tue Jun 30 00:01:13 2015 UTC,"Verified Record  This Day in Baseball History: (2007) It's things like this that make baseball great. In a pre-game ceremony on Disability Awareness Night, the Fenway faithful show their support for the cause when they assist a young man with autism. The enthusiastic Red Sox crowd of 38,000 fans continues singing the national anthem when the nervous singer has trouble getting through the songs.  MIL @ PHI  Not gonna lie, I got pretty lucky with this game yesterday as I was convinced pretty much all game there was no way the Brewcrew could come back. But they did, because the Phillies are the Phillies and they like to Philly in Philly fashion. Anyway, this Taylor Jungmann fellow for the Brewers has been pretty good so far, which I'm sure Milwaukee is happy about since he's been one of their higher-touted prospects for some time now. Anyway, through 23 innings this season (yeah, small sample size so take these with a grain of salt), he's posted a 3.19 FIP/2.74 ERA, striking out 7.43 per 9, and a groundball rate of 56.1%. It seems like Milwaukee has kept him on a short leash, as he hasn't pitched more than 6 innings but one time in 4 starts, but he's kept some good teams in check as he held the Pirates to 1 ER, the Nats to 2 ER, and blanked the Mets through 5. Anyway the real story here is that both the Brewers and Phillies have been doing better at the plate and somehow both rank within the top 11 teams in terms of OPS over the last week. What? I guess I'd give the Phillies the edge here because they have Hamels on the mound and the Brewers are pretty not great against LHPs (especially power pitchers), but wouldn't be surprised if they still knocked one out of the park. Wind is definitely batter-friendly today, and I think the left-handed heavy Phillies lineup should do work on Jungmann today. I like over 7 runs total and Phillies ML (-120) both for small plays.  TEX @ BAL  Interesting pitching matchup here. According to metrics, Gonzalez is due for regression and has been quite lucky (4.60 FIP/3.58 ERA, .248 BAbip) and he almost always gives up at least one home run a game. He's actually one of my favorite pitchers to watch because a) he's super underrated and b) has better control in terms of painting corners than many other pitchers. His problem has always been that every once in a while he'll hang a low-movement fastball up in the zone, and it gets demolished. I say that this matchup is interesting because metrics say that Gonzo is due for regression and Lewis should actually be better than he's been, but splits favor Gonzo. Miguel's home ERA is less than a quarter of his road ERA, while left-handed batter eat Lewis up on the road. Between Paredes, Davis, Parmelee, and Wieters, Colby will have a hell of a time keeping runs off the board. Gonzo holds batters to .180/.242/.308 (.247 wOBA) at OPACY, but Texas has been pretty hot so it's hard to say how he'll fare against them. I don't feel great about the 8.5 run total (though I'd tend to lean over), but I have a feeling that the O's will get to Colby pretty early. I like the O's ML (-160).  BOS @ TOR  There's a reason Eduardo Rodriguez (who I believe will be a great pitcher one day) got slammed once this season against the Jays, as Toronto owns a league-best .842 OPS against LHPs this season. Yes, their bats are slumping over their last 6 games or so, but they are liable to go off at any moment, and I can definitely see them doing that at home against their basement rival Red Sox team. Marco Estrada damn near threw a perfect game his last time out and has looked solid more often than not (though his last start against Boston he gave up 5 ER through 5 IP). Total is set a bit high for my liking, but I think Toronto's batting slump ends today at home. Taking Toronto ML (-150).  PIT @ DET  This line is kind of wonky, but I think I understand why it's set as such. Anyone that's seen Verlander pitch throughout his career know he's not the same pitcher he once was, and he's looked pretty dismal through 2 games this year. His velocity over the last two season has dropped, and batters are making far less soft contact against him than ever before. The reason the Pirates aren't a heavy favorite here is because Detroit has again managed to be in the top three teams in OPS over the last week, and are hitting the ball as good as anyone right now. However, I don't think they'll do much against Cole as he's been one of the league's best pitchers; beyond that, as I'm sure I've mentioned before the Tigers struggle against K-heavy pitchers like Gerrit. The Pirates offense has been pretty middle-of-the-pack lately, but should do some work on Verlander. Since I'm sure Verlander should go at least ONE inning without shitting the bed, I like No runs 1i and the Pirates ML (-118).  SFG @ MIA  I hate Vogelsong, but I love these odds. Without Stanton, the Marlins have become the coldest team in the league, posting a .529 OPS over the last 7 days...meanwhile the Giants have somehow outhit the Orioles, Tigers and Rockies for a league-best .871 OPS. Vogelsong looked okay in his last two starts, but really I just the Giants bats to get the job done against Latos who has been dismal in Marlins Park for some reason or the other. Granted, Latos has gotten better every month this season, but he will struggle against this good gap-hitting Giants team. The value of Giants ML (-102) is just too good for me to pass up.  CHC @ NYM  Both teams rank in the bottom quarter of the league in terms of OPS over the last week, but I look for the Cubs' favor to change today against Niese. At Citi Field, LHB's are slashing .326/.364/.548 against him (.391 wOBA), and though he's had a better June than May, I don't trust him against the potent Cubs lineup. Hendricks has pitched better than his ERA indicates, and owns a 3.39 FIP on the road this year. However, Hendricks has had a pretty bad June as his opponents are slugging .509 against him this month. With the wind blowing sharply out of left field, I'd say the odds of one of these pitchers getting their shit blown up is pretty good. With a low total, I'd say that over 7 runs total is a good bet here."

sportsbook,3bkl9a,bang_sloots,19,Tue Jun 30 21:32:38 2015 UTC,"I think it’s hysterical that Justin Verlander is still getting as much respect as he’s received so far this year. There is no way he should only be +110 vs Gerit Cole. I actually don’t love this spot for Cole, who has been iffy his last couple times out. But at least in his last start, you can quickly identify a .467 BABIP as the cause, particularly when his velocity and swinging strike % was still there. I won’t play him in DFS because the Tigers offense has been relatively hot lately and hit righties well, but I can’t pass up -120 odds against a guy with a 5.45/5.21 SIERA/xFIP split. PIT -115. Speaking of DFS, I do like Pedro Alvarez in this one as a solid +1 at a price of $3,900 and eligibility at 1st and 3rd. Verlander has terrible numbers vs lefties so far and the Tigers bullpen allows 1.21 HR/9 to LHB this year. 4th worst mark in baseball.     I’ve slowly been talking myself into Jordan Zimmerman of late. After a not so great start to the year, he seems to have settled in. He’s enjoyed a sub-3.00 xFIP in 2 of his last 3 starts, with the one outlier coming against this same Braves team despite holding him scoreless over 8 innings. The air density and his shaky fastball scare me from playing him in DFS, however, but I like the Nats here at -120. Shelby Miller is an interesting case as 2015 marks the second straight year where his advanced metrics don’t align with his traditional stats (K/BB, BABIP, SIERA/xFIP vs W/L and ERA) but this year there is a new outlier in his repertoire: A ridiculously low 0.37 HR/9. For a guy who had a HR/9 above 1.00 in both 2013 and 2014, and 30 HRs coming off his fastball in those years, I absolutely love the Washington lineup in DFS. Particularly the lefties (Harper, Span, and Robinson).      Cincy running hot right now and both bullpens are a mess after last night’s high scoring affair. Of all people for a hot offense to face, Minnesota is throwing out Phil “BP” Hughes. Big Phil has allowed a HR in each of his last 4 games, tying in well with his 1.55 HR/9 this year. Feels super square, but I don’t know how you can avoid taking the MIN/CIN Over 7.5 -120. Feels way off, especially in Cincy. I don’t mind the Reds as short favorites, but again, bullpen woes worry me. Over is the safer play. Reds stack probably too obvious in DFS tourneys, but a pretty great play in cash games.      My favorite game of the night. Lots of interesting items. First, as I tweeted out on Monday, the Mets BABIP over the last 15 days is an unbelievable .224. It’s a full 20 points below the next closest team (Mariners) and more than 2 full standard deviations below the league median. I’ve never seen anything like it. Now this stat typically signifies luck, but in addition to the atrocious BABIP, they also sport an awful .096 ISO and 20% k rate during the 2 week window. And all this includes their pitchers, who have been swinging some of the best bats on the team of late. I don’t know what to think. They are obviously a better offense than they’ve been over this stretch, but they definitely aren’t a good team by any stretch. I can make the argument that they are better than Miami and Atlanta, for example, but hard to slot them any higher than that. Chicago’s starter, Kyle Hendricks, has only been a bit better than average this year, but has shown flashes of greatness against weaker lineups (e.g. vs San Diego on 5/21). The other interesting thing about this game is that it marks the first time in 23 games that the Cubs face a left handed pitcher. The streak goes back to June 4th, when they beat Gio Gonzalez 2-1. Now, only scoring 2 runs off Gio isn’t all that impressive, but this Cubs team is absolutely STACKED with hitters who crush lefties. I have to look at data from the start of last year to get a meaningful amount of ABs (since they’ve faced so few of them in 2015), but consider the following OPS numbers by current Cubs hitters:     Bryant 1.105  Rizzo .947  Fowler .880     And while Jon Niese isn’t a total pushover, he has allowed 9 HRs to RHB this year at a rate of 1.25 HR/9. Cubs -120 is a multi unit play for me. I’ll also throw Hendricks in a DFS lineup or two, and you better believe I’ll have the three batters listed above in those lineups as well.     Insert “African Kid” meme here: You’re telling I can get a right handed pitcher with a K/9 rate of 11.47 on the season against a Tampa Bay team that has struck out 22.5% of the time over the past 2 weeks and nearly got perfecto’d by a rookie last night for only -115?? Yes please. Indians -115 is a ridiculous line. Don’t let his modest 6-3 record and 4.06 ERA fool you, Danny Salazar is absolutely an ace in this league. He will likely strikeout 10+ on Tuesday night. And while Erasmo Ramirez is slightly better than his traditional stats suggest, he’s still a #4 starter at best.     So tough to back the White Sox right now, especially on the road against arguably the best team in baseball right now. But given the way St Louis struggles vs LHP (They have the league’s 24th wOBA and 4th highest K% vs southpaws), I can’t pass it up. Chicago’s bats are heating back up too, averaging 4.6 runs over last 5 games. Under is probably good too, but I’ll stick with just the ChiSox +110."

sportsbook,3bkl9a,whorunit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:30:22 2015 UTC,"Not really. Limits are too low, and derivatives typically have higher vig and more variability. Salazar tonight was a perfect example. Knew he'd have a good game (he did), but did it without striking a lot of guys out. Not worth it to me. Just take the Indians, why get cute with it?"
sportsbook,3bkl9a,EL_Apostrophe,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:52:39 2015 UTC,"Yea the vig is definitely high. I'm starting to agree - I think it's too pricy to play props on a consistent basis. I think I've got something like 3% ROI on props exclusively so i've been able to make them a profitable venture - But I would be in the red if I didn't lay big $ on a few gems I found earlier in the year. Sale over K's both games against the Rangers were absurdly low - I think first game was 7 and second game 7.5 ... Joey Gallo nearly single-handedly saw to it that those were going to hit. There was a Gerrit Cole -1.5 K's vs Vogelsong prop that landed as well, though I was probably a bit lucky on that one. My book lets me bet up to $1K which is a good 4 units for me, about as large as I'd want to bet on a single event.   Thanks again for your contribution. Not even just the picks, but I really appreciate you including the analysis - you definitely have me thinking a bit more outside the box in looking at baseball data than I had been previously."

The big one is that their lineup projects really well when going against righties as they are tonight. Also, their superior fielding and far superior bullpen more than make up for the fact that they were throwing out the inferior starter.  As it turns out, however, the market closed around -115 on the Dodgers so the quick answer is the model was likely just off on this game."

sportsbook,3bkr45,TheSpooneh,2,Tue Jun 30 14:48:29 2015 UTC,"Taking KT over Jin Air Green Wings.   Starting match is sOs vs Zest.   Zest is probably one of the best players in PvP right now. Both players have won against each other, but Zest usually wins.   JAGW's team has strong depth, but KT Rolster's has more top class players.   Likely JAGW Players: sOs, Maru, Rogue, Cure/Trap  Likely KT Players: Zest, Life, Stats, TY/Flash  Predictions:   Zest > sOs  Zest < Rogue  Stats > Rogue  Stats < Maru  Life > Maru  Life > Cure/Trap  My bet: KT Rolster @ 2.4  Note: Mind you this is all-kill playoffs. ANYTHING could happen. KT's players have been slumping but I feel Stats might surprise us coming out big. Also sOs looked scary with the 4-0 last night. sOs is the definition of unpredictable.  LOSS, definitely still feel it was the right play. Odds on KT were too good."

sportsbook,3bjqen,fives_gw,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:50:06 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately in this format there's just no way I've found to combat the problem. It has been a little better in the past week (which I know because i've been trying to check every few hours), but it's still happening. I saw this pick at 2 about 5 minutes before the match began and now it's clearly higher. Similarly, the ""Heyward to get a hit"" pick from a few days back was at 2 when right before the game and then after was down at 0, DESPITE it being a winning bet.  The whole thing is compounded by the amount of early matches (tennis, soccer) that are up top now because american basketball/football/hockey are over and most soccer leagues are on break. If anybody has ideas or solutions i'm more than open to them, I just don't know if we can implement them in this space."

sportsbook,3bgd0d,_thankyoubasedgod,20,Tue Jun 30 01:30:05 2015 UTC,"Happy Monday fellas. Before I get to my plays, I just want to comment on a couple things..     Saturday's Results: They sucked. Plain and simple. The A's squandered multiple opportunities and Chris Young again defied all odds with another ridiculous BABIP outing (.211). But so what? Yes, it was a max play of 4 units for me, which is equal to 8% of my initial bankroll. I post all my plays on Twitter and keep results in a publicly viewable spreadsheet. If you filter on 4-unit plays (column D) it's actually the 11th time I've gone with a max play this year....and the first time I've lost. I could lose the next 6 max plays and still feel like I'm making the right decision. This is partially why I almost never give out the unit size of my plays. Probably going to go back to that now. If people want to judge my success on one day of picks, where were you yesterday when I went 4-0? To quote Rick Pitino, the negativity in this thread sucks.      Variance: Sticking with the Oakland play, I pegged the A's to win 70% of the time. The odds paid such that they would only win ~56% of the time. That's a huge calculated edge, hence my max play. But it still means that it is expected to lose 30% of the time. Are you surprised when a .300 OPS guy gets on base? No. This is why bankroll management is key. If you're butt hurt over losing a single game, it means you are doing it wrong.     Regression: Someone asked why I was expecting Young to do poorly when his BABIP regression wasn't going to happen all in one game. And something about his defense being the same so why would it get worse. Two things here, for one, defense has very little impact on BABIP. Certainly not to the extent that Young's numbers differ from league average. If the defense was the cause for his BABIP being so low, than the entire Royals pitching staff should have a similarly low BABIP, no? They don't. The KC team BABIP is a full 70 points higher, and that's after including Young's unsustainable .204 number over 69.2 IP.      As for the regression piece, it's true the overall BABIP isn't going to snap back to his career average in one game. That would require a BABIP of 1.000 over like 30 ABs. That's the wrong way to think about it. What I am suggesting is that each start from here on out should have a BABIP expectation closer to his career mark of .248, much worse than his 2015 number. And the vegas line did not represent as such (at least not until it was bet up over -150 prior to game time). It's not like BABIP is some self aware thing that will slowly get worse by game.

sportsbook,3bgd0d,neonwhiteknife,2,Mon Jun 29 20:41:06 2015 UTC,"RE Chris Young.  There was recently an article on fangraphs about him, pretty much saying while his low BABIP seems unsustainable, it more than likely actually IS sustainable. He has been noticably below the league average BABIP for a decade straight, and has pitched to BABIPs below .220 for an entire season more than once before.  The author pretty much says it makes no sense, but its happening. Just a heads up for next time Chris Young steps up to the mound.  edit: EL_Apostrophe has refuted some of my incorrect claims in his response below."
sportsbook,3bgd0d,seank11,3,Mon Jun 29 17:45:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no he hasn't.      His career low BABIP was .226 in 2006 (aside from years wher ehe had only ~20 IP). It was a freak season for by any measurement. It was 9 years ago and prior to a number of injuries, so a better proxy to use might be his .238 BABIP last year (2nd best of career). And it was largely fueled by having more than half his innings at Safeco, a notorious pitchers park. In those starts, he had a BABIP of .207. Away from Safeco, it was a more reasonable .262.      His current .204 BABIP would be a new career low (by a lot) and way below not only league averages (~.300) but even his already incredible career average (.248). I've acknowledged in prior posts that something about either height or his stuff contributes to the fact that Young's BABIP is more than just luck, which is how his numbers have been roughly 50 points lower than everyone else. But to add another 50 points to that discrepancy this year with no park factor reasoning or supporting evidence that he is doing something different screams ""lucky 1st half of the year"". If I had to guess at the underlying driver of his 2015 BABIP, I'd say it's part to do with the teams he's faced (look at his BABIPs vs the 3 best offenses he's faced this year: STL, NYY, CLE .286, .313, .389) and the fact that 17% of his innings came in relief at a BABIP of .094.      He's scheduled to face two more easy lineups in Minnesota and Tampa for his next two starts, but is tentatively listed to face Toronto on July 12. I may have to increase my max bet size that afternoon..."

sportsbook,3bgd0d,-fry-,0,Fri Jul 3 11:42:04 2015 UTC,sorry but all of you guys are looking way too far into this. Just look at the simple stats -- compare -- and deduce.  -J
sportsbook,3bgd0d,hairyballls,9,Mon Jun 29 21:54:06 2015 UTC,"verified record  TDiBS: (2004) At Bank One Ballpark, Diamondbacks’ 40 year-old fireballer Randy Johnson records his 4000th career strikeout, whiffing Padres' third baseman Jeff Cirillo, a fellow USC Trojan, to become the fourth player in major league baseball history to reach the plateau. The ‘Big Unit’ (3,237 1/3) needs less innings than Nolan Ryan (3,844 2/3), Roger Clemens (4,151), and Steve Carlton (4,991 1/3) to accomplish the feat.  MIL @ PHI  Those of you that have tailed me should know I don't for the most part blindly fade pitchers. There are only a few pitchers that I almost always bet against, and Sean O'Sullivan is one of them. I mean, just look at his stats: 6.28 FIP/5.34 ERA, 4.30 K/9, 2.52 BB/9, 2.08 HR/9. He is better at home than on the road, but that's like saying a Burrito Bomb from 7/11 is better than half-eaten Chipotle you found in a trash can sitting in 90 degree heat. He's actually getting worse as the season progresses and he just hasn't fooled anyone. The Brewers have played some ""better"" baseball over the last 2 weeks, posting a .266/.309/.417 slashline in their last 12 games. The Phillies bats seem to have rebounded a bit as well, but I'd assume Jimmy Nelson should at the very least hold them to less than 4 runs. Not my favorite play (and maybe kind of a reach), but I'll take Brewers ML (-143).  TEX @ BAL  These are two teams trending in opposite directions. Baltimore looks like they did through most of last year...in fact, with Schoop coming off the DL and the need for one more 'pen arm, the O's have a rare problem: they have too much offense. Someone's gotta go, either via trade or DFA (most likely Delmon Young and Steve Pearce), which is why I assume both are in the lineup today. While it looks like B'more is giving some of their daily players rest (Wheaties and Paredes), they still have plenty of pop (not to mention they've had 21 HRs over their last 12 games). Texas has slowed down a bit from their big May, as they're batting .231/.281/.361 over their last 12 games. I've said this before, Norris has been better than his numbers indicate, but he still struggles against lefties and the Rangers have plenty of those. I think this game will be offense-heavy, I think over 9 runs total is a great bet here.  CLE @ TB  Hard to say how Cody Anderson will fare, but in the spirit of this new trend of ""no run in the 1st"" bets, I like that bet here. Taking No runs 1i.  MIN @ CIN  In this game of two overperforming pitchers, somebody is due to get their dickhole smashed. Quite honestly, both Pelfrey and Leake have similar peripherals, though Pelfrey tends to keep the ball in the yard better than Leake. Quite honestly, even the offenses in question here are pretty similar; both own similar lines in June, with OPS' in the low-to-mid .700s and both teams are good against groundball pitching (which Pelfrey and Leake both are). The difference maker for me? Leake has been pretty bad at Great American Ballpark this year (FIP over 5.00, opponents slugging .509). Pelfrey hasn't been much better on the road, but still has the edge here. In this close a matchup I feel like the plus-odds on the Twins are a gift. This is a value play, but I'm taking Twins ML (+145) and over 7.5 runs total for a smaller play.  LAD @ ARI  Yes, the Dodgers' bats have been dead lately, but they've had a rough run here against tough Cubs pitching and then a series in one of the most pitcher-friendly parks around. I think tonight will probably remedy their woes as they have Allen Webster on the mound, a relatively inexperienced and not-that-great young pitcher. He's a career 4.64 FIP, 3.75 BB/9 guy, and the Dodgers shouldn't have a problem with him. I like the Dodgers ML (-158) in a game that they should win.  COL @ OAK  Let me set this up for you: Two awful starting pitchers, wind blowing pretty strongly out of right field, one super hot offense and one not terrible offense, and two mediocre-at-best bullpens. I don't know if this is a trap, but I'll take the bait. Playing over 8 runs (+105)."
sportsbook,3bgd0d,j3rown,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:41:06 2015 UTC,Your analysis of MIL/PHI makes o8 sound like a good bet too. Thoughts on that number? The only thing keeping me off of it is the chance one of the offenses sputters tonight.

sportsbook,3bgd0d,121212333,2,Mon Jun 29 16:34:43 2015 UTC,Thoughts on Indians/Rays No Runs 1st?  Indians' offense is ice cold while they have a guy on the mound who debuted against the Rays with a shutout.   Rays offense isn't much hotter as they've only scored 20 over their last 7 games. Meanwhile they only managed to get 6 hits off of Anderson last week.  I think this will be a pitching duel and I might even throw a little bit on Indians/Rays u7.

sportsbook,3bfpz2,sbpotdbot,10,Sun Jun 28 20:40:47 2015 UTC,"Sweden Superettan kick off 18:20pm uk time SOCCER  Jonkopings Sodra vs Degerfors   Jonkopings ML @ 1.75  Jonkopings are top of the league after 14 games, here they play their game in hand against a Deferfors side who sit in 6th place of 16.   Now a little background on the two sides, Jonkopings have been in the Superettan for around 10 season in Sweden and have had a mixed bag of finishing positions. They usually languish around lower mid table until recently where they had a 4th place finish last season and look strong again this season.   They play their home games at Stadsparksvallen, which holds 5200 fans and is a proper old football ground, which was built in 1902.   Degefors are a team who have spent most of their life in the Allsvenskan, which is the top flight in Sweden, howver they lost their place 4 seasons ago and are struggling to get back. Their main achievement was winning the Swedish Cup in 1993 and stands as their only major cup triumph.   Onto form now and Jonkopings have played 8 at home so far winning 7 and drawing one. They have scored 19 goals and let in 7 so this match may well include some goals.   Degefors have played 7 away, winning 3 drawing one adn losing 3. However they have lost 2 out of the last 3 away to teams who are higher placed in the league, so they seem to do well against the lesser teams but struggle against the top 6. This includes a heavy 3-0 loss to Ljungskile, who Jonkopings beat recently in the league.  A player to watch out for is Tommy Tehlin, who plays for Jonkopings and is second in the leagues top scorer charts.  Pick of the day - Jonkopings ML @ 1.75  Other bets to consider:   Jonkopings over 1.5 team goals @ 1.72. SLighly lower odds but they know where the net is this team and average over 2 goals at home in the league so far.   Jonkopings Asian handicap -0.5/-1.0 @ 2.025 - Higher odds but if they can get the goals here this could come in  Good luck all today"

Also Chung is excellent on the return and Hubert can struggle to keep his 1st serve in play.

I rarely bet on baseball and just thought I would see if I could go on some crazy streak. On a side note (if you are in the U.S.) have you ever heard of streak for cash by espn.

I've never tried it personally but a friend expalined it to me, something like pick someone that gets a hit and if you get like 50 in row you win a million dollars.  The reason I asked about the streak for cash thing was the other day I was thinking about getting a group together on reddit. This sub is probably the best for it. I'm currently in a group with about 80 people and the way it works is we all throw in $10 a month and whoever gets the longest streak in that month wins the prize pool. I think this sub could really get something going. The money thing would be a little different since we are all on the internet but what are your thoughts?"

Dignitas actually did really well exceeding most of their projections and turning out great value.  Today they face TDK who Cloud 9 beat up on yesterday.  TDK continues to show bursts of good play that keep them in games just long enough for the opposing team to get a good amount of fantasy points.  I'm definitely going Kiwi as he is still very cheap and definitely going Gamsu because he is just playing on another level right now.  The final Dig spot can be either Shipthur or Corejj, their projections and salaries are almost the same but I'm leaning towards Corejj judging from yesterdays performance, though it's prudent to know that NME has a knack for keeping mids down and Shipthur will most likely perform much better today.  After Dig the next team to hit hard would be NME going against T8.  T8 loves to play super aggressive bloody games and yesterday we saw TSM dodge these fights and just win through strategy and map control.  I think NME will not shy away from the fights and this game could be a big one.  If you enjoy making multiple rosters I suggest this roster but putting T8 players instead of NME because it's going to be a volatile game that could swing in either teams favor or end up being good fantasy on both sides giving you two solid entries.  I'm leaning towards NME though and I see value in Trashy/Otter/Innox.  To fill the last two flex spots I looked towards TiP going up against C9.  I believe this game will be a good one and C9, although looking good today, was going against TDK and they will hold their own but fall to TiP in the end.  Apollo is the best buy from TiP but he would leave you with very little option for the last flex spot so I instead chose to go with Adrian and Rush with the assumption that Apollo and a bottom tier player would not out score two good players on what I presume to be a winning team.     Top 5 Projected Scorers  -Gamsu  -CoreJJ  -Shipthur  -Apollo  -Innox  Top 5 Value Players  -Gamsu  -Kiwikid  -Otter  -Shipthur  -CoreJJ        Thanks for reading and play safe this week, 50/50s and Double Ups all day.

Oh boy.  This is a tough one for sure.  Liquid looked outstanding yesterday, obviously fueled by Fenix's amazing quadra kill.  It is hard to really gauge them as they got so ahead with that single play which gave them baron.  Gravity looked alright.  I hated their team with Hecarim mid/Rumble top/Eve in the jungle.  It really seemed like they only won because Impulse was lost mid to late game.  The constant problem with Impulse is they are one dimensional and it once again bit them in the ass.  As much as I like Gravity here, I really think these odds are very accurate.  I believe Liquid will win this game. Going low here as I believe the odds are accurate.  2 units on Liquid.       Cloud 9 2.18 vs Team Impulse 1.67 - Impulse blue side/Cloud 9 fan vote.  I'll repeat it until it's not true.  Impulse has one plan, fight as much as possible.  They ignore vision and game flow.  They are lost unless there is a fight in front of their face.  It is a huge weakness for them as teams have started to identify to just play around it.  If Cloud 9 has prepared for them, as they should, then Cloud 9 should win here.  Cloud 9 out prepares and out coaches Impulse.  They just need it to transition into the game.  Cloud 9 4 units       Team Solo Mid 1.76 vs CLG 2.05 - TSM blue side/fan vote.  The glaring blunders of Xsmithie are starting to cost CLG more.  TSM holds a 1-0 lead over CLG this split with a convincing 29 minute win in Week 2.  CLG has the tendency to tilt and the game yesterday is perfect tilting conditions.  Look for TSM to exploit this with some cheesy ganks.  Wildturtle again will look to step up to keep his LCS spot.  3 units on TSM       Dignitas 1.22 vs. Team Dragon Knights 4.16 - TDK blue side/Dignitas fan vote. Ninja and Emporer will make their debut today with TDK. They have been in NA since Saturday morning.  It is unclear if TDK will lose bans.  From what we can see, TDK has not practiced much with Emperor and Ninja.  Ninja's recent games: http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=crossna and Emperor's recent games: http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=EmperorNA Looking at the low volume of games and the small amount of time they've had to practice, I'd say it is safe to go big on Dig here.  8 units Dig.       Enemy 1.73 vs.  Team 8 2.08 - Team 8 blue side/Enemy fan vote.  Team 8 looked ok early against TSM yesterday.  They got a nice gank which put them a bit ahead but then crumbled to map control.  Enemy got dominated by Dignitas, not surprising.  Enemy has a large edge here.  Team 8 is still reeling from the loss of their best player in Slooshie. Goldenglue is not the mid laner they needed to replace him.  Enemy is a hardworking team that has put in the preparation for each game.  After their loss to Slooshi and Team 8 earlier in the split they'll be prepared to take down Slooshiless Team 8 this time. 3 units Enemy.       https://twitter.com/esportsbettor     http://esportsbettor.cappertek.com +87 units, 15% ROI over 164 picks     Join us at /r/esportsbook and /r/sportsbook     stander414 on KiK if anyone wants to chat esports"

With a win Iran draws even with Poland for the all important second place, so Poland needs to win as many games head to head after going 6-2 vs Iran in their own building. I think Poland takes care of business today and might even win at +246.  I am also taking Serbia -1.5 games vs Italy -140 today. The juice is higher, but I think at home Serbia sweeps or at least beats the less talented away Italy 3-1. Both are in a tie for second place and I think Serbia's more talented team + home court will equal a convincing win here today. ML is -300 for those who are interested but its outside POD odds"

sportsbook,3bb6gk,aget23,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:21:41 2015 UTC,Seems like a decent bet but I am hedging a bit and going with them to advance. Don't like the pens at 90 min. Think it makes the draw really enticing and discourages weaker teams from even trying for a goal.
sportsbook,3bb6gk,kdrisck,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:23:35 2015 UTC,I didn't watch soccer that much and thought this is an elimination match. So Brazil can advance even if they draw?
sportsbook,3bb6gk,aget23,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:33:46 2015 UTC,"This is why you have to be careful with soccer if you are a casual. This is an elimination match and it looks like a sure thing on paper. However, the Brazil ML only covers the first 90 minutes, as all soccer bets do. Extra time and Pens are not covered in the ML. Copa America is played with strange rules in that there is no extra time and it goes right to pens if it is a draw after 90 min. What that means is there have been a lot of draws and weaker teams don't really need a goal and just defend for 90 in the hopes of getting lucky in pens. Brazil could very well have to go to pens to advance tonight."

sportsbook,3b957t,rs1x,12,Sat Jun 27 00:01:35 2015 UTC,"Verified Record  This Day in Baseball History: (2008) In a 15-6 Mets victory over the Yankees at the Stadium, Carlos Delgado, with a double, three-run homer and a grand slam, establishes a new team record with 9 RBIs in one game. The first baseman, who breaks Dave Kingman’s 1976 club mark, also surpasses Sky King on the all-time home run list with the first of his two homers, moving into 34th place with his 443rd career round-tripper.  MIN @ MIL  Man after last night there's no way I can touch this game one way or the other. Gibson is definitely due for regression (4.45 FIP/3.35 ERA, .273 BAbip) and quite frankly I don't know what to expect out of the Brewcrew's offense at this point. Garza will probably be better than he's been as his luck has been pretty bad up to this point, but I've never been able to trust him because of his streaky nature. Normally in a ""coin toss"" game like this it makes sense to go with the plus-odds team, but this one just isn't safe enough for my liking. No play.  WAS @ PHI  Adam Morgan sounds like the name of your annoying coworker down the hall that always walks into the break room and says ""MAN something smells good!"" like he's never fucking smelled reheated leftovers before. Anyway, beyond the prospect of thunderstorms and 17 mph winds sweeping toward home plate, this game is probably a no play for me. Juice on Gio is pretty high , especially because the Phillies aren't looking particularly Philly-ish right now (.296/.348/.489 over their last 5 games) and have a much better track record against LHPs this year than RHPs. Gio has a clear deficiency against solid RHBs, but the Phillies don't really have any of those outside of Maikel Franco. Anyway, the Nats should still win this game but I'm not going to pay (-170) to find out. The only real value here is on the Phillies ML, which I'm definitely not going to play either. No play.  ATL @ PIT  Another game that will more than likely be hampered by rain/strong homeplate-bound winds. Anyway, the Barves have looked bad at the plate over their last five games, slashing .216/.266/.281 over that span. The Pirates haven't been stellar so to speak, but definitely better than that (.250/.335/.383 over their last 5). The Buccos don't have a deficiency against LHPs either, so there goes Teheran's ""edge"". Anyway, I'm not a fan of either of these pitchers really...Morton's .268 BAbip indicates that he's gotten lucky (which isn't good considering ""lucky"" for him equates to an ERA around 4 and a 4.11 FIP). Teheran has not looked the same as he did last year, partly because his K's are down and walks are up (and HR/FB% is wayyy up to 15.6%) The 7 run total is appealing, but it is literally supposed thunderstorm basically all fucking day. Fucking Pittsburgh. No play.  KC @ OAK  Ayyy finally a game worth playing. /u/el_apostrophe said it all; Chris Young is definitely the luckiest fucking pitcher in the league. His 4.14 FIP/2.83 ERA differential is egregious, his .203 BAbip looks like a goddamned typo, and as a flyball pitcher (58% FB), he will have a fucking nightmare of a time at O.Co where the wind will be blowing out to right field at a pretty strong clip. Southpaw Kazmir should be able to hold KC in check though he will probably still give up a few runs. I'm playing A's ML (-150) and I'll be making a smaller play on over 7.5 runs total.  CWS @ DET  Fuck Danks, fuck Ryan, fuck these teams. No play.  CIN @ NYM  There is no world in where Michael Lorenzen should outpitch Matt Harvey. Lorenzen owns a 5.62 FIP/3.56 ERA and between that and his 83.3% LOB/.253 BAbip it's safe to say he's been lucky as hell (like, Chris Young level of lucky). His 16.1% HR/FB rate should be a concern today against LHBs, not just because they're batting .289/.392/.506 against him, but also because the wind will be blowing toward the third baseline, so good oppo southpaws will be able to take advantage of that. Good news for Lorenzen: the Mets don't have any of those. Bad news for Lorenzen: he's still not that great. We all know the book on Harvey, but as solid as he's (mostly) been this year it's clear he's still not at 100% (and no one really expects a pitcher a few months removed from coming back from TJ to be 100%). He's given up slews of runs to teams you would expect him to (Marlins & Pirates). Anyway, if you look at Lorenzen's game scores, it's so strange because he's only had one start where he gave up more than 3 ER but in any case metrics indicate that his luck will catch up with him. The Reds aren't great against K-pitchers, and I think Harvey should get better as the season progresses, but it's hard to bet on the Mets who are slashing .154/.221/.248 over their last 5 games. I do like no runs scored in the first inning though.  NYY @ HOU  Not only is the Houston offense mid-slump right now, they will probably struggle against Tanaka today as they slash .180/.275/.316 against K-pitchers. Masahiro has been great on the road this season, as batters just aren't getting anything going against him away from Yankees Stadium. On the flipside, the Yanks offense is on a tear here lately with a .861 OPS over the last 14 days. Look for the Yanks heavy switch-hitting lineup to win this close game. At the price, I can't pass up Yankees ML (-120).  COL @ SFG  Wasn't gonna play this one, but it kept nagging at me. The total for this game is predicated on the fact that both Lincecum and Rusin will be solid today. Quite frankly that sounds like a ""best case scenario"" but not the most likely scenario. Chances are one of these pitchers will shit the bed, especially since both these teams are hot as fuck at the plate right now (Giants .285/.356/.448 over their last 5, Rockies .335/.401/.566 over their last 5). Rusin's ERA away from Coors is pretty bad, and the Giants aren't a bad LHP hitting team. Hitting over 7 runs total hard."

sportsbook,3b957t,EL_Apostrophe,6,Sat Jun 27 18:44:39 2015 UTC,"Matt Garza + Miller Park is typically a formula that equals “Over”, but I’m actually a big fan of the MIN/MIL Under 8 -115 on Saturday afternoon. Garza’s last two starts (where he saw a total of 16 runs score while on the mound) are definitely influencing this line and recency bias may even drive the line up higher as we approach game time and the public loads up on the over. But as much as I am not a Matt Garza fan, prior to his last two starts (which came against a stingy KC offense and the other at Coors Field) Garza had gone 3 straight starts with 1 or 0 ER. Including a 7 inning effort against this same Twins team. The Twins have been pretty awful vs right handed pitching all year, save for last night of course. But with the forecast calling for clear skies (a big edge for pitchers in a day game) and Garza sporting an ERA that is over a full run better than it is at night over the past 3 seasons,  Minnesota’s Friday night outburst is likely to be a one night thing. For the Twins, Kyle Gibson is starting, and while it didn’t work out for me with Carlos Martinez vs the Marlins a few days ago, I love the angle of backing a big time groundball pitcher vs a lineup with real high groundball numbers (Milwaukee’s active roster has the 7th highest GB% in the bigs).      Max unit play: Oakland -128. All the stars are aligning with this one. Chris Young is a massive regression candidate thanks to his ridiculously low .203 BABIP and 5.05/5.11 SIERA/xFIP split which is miles away from his 2.83 ERA. Bottom line, Chris Young is one of the 10-15 worst starters in baseball and is only a short dog on the road in Oakland. We only get opportunities like this a handful of times each year. To add a cherry on top, air density is forecasted to be fairly high at 68, which is usually a good thing for pitchers who throw a lot of fastballs, but when your average fastball velocity is only 86.3 MPH, adding a tick or two to that speed puts him in the danger zone. You never want to consistently throw between 87-89 MPH in the majors. Anything slower can induce swing timing issues or soft contact, anything faster is tough to catch up to. But 87-89 MPH has only one place: batting practice. Oh, and the skies are expected to be overcast too, a perfect backdrop for Oakland’s offense to hit against. Kazmir hasn’t been as good as you think. His metrics are misleading because they are coming via very few innings. For example, Kazmir has a K/9 of 8.53 but has only struck out more than 7 three times and all three of those games came in April. KC’s offense is scrappy too, so while Oakland should still win by a touchdown (a sentence rarely uttered), I won’t be surprised if the Royals scrounge up 3-4 runs themselves. Which leads me to another, albeit smaller, play on this game: KC/OAK Over 7.5 -115.     NYY/HOU U7.5 -105. Japanese pitcher in a dome alert! It still boggles my mind that teams with domes aren’t more aggressive in the pursuit of Japanese pitchers. Just about every professional baseball game in Japan is played in a dome and you’ll note that many Japanese stars come over to the MLB touting some great movement on their pitches (Gyroball anyone?). Well, it’s a lot easier to get a ball to consistently do funky things when throwing it in a controlled atmosphere, which will effectively be the case in Houston as the forecast cals for rain all day, leading to the closing of the retractable roof. I love backing Japanese nationals in domes for this reason and it’s especially nice when they are facing a team that strikes out a ton like Houston does. That said, I don’t feel like I can back the Yankees outright against any left handed pitching, so the better play here is the under. If you are playing lower limits, you could even just go with a HOU TT Under instead."
sportsbook,3b957t,whats_golden,3,Sat Jun 27 16:29:11 2015 UTC,"Just to play devils advocate on that As write up, it possible that maybe Chris Young isn't 'lucky' per say but instead has benefited from being so tall and hitters having trouble picking up the ball against a tall pitcher. Maybe he is able to survive with BP fastballs because of his stature on the mound?  Also, just curious why you wouldn't play run line with the a's if you're so confident."
sportsbook,3b957t,EL_Apostrophe,4,Sat Jun 27 13:27:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're following what I was trying to say. There is definitely some reason - and height is likely it - why Young has a career BABIP of .249 over 1,100+ innings. That's a number nearly 50 points below league norms. So I agree that he is able to be ""lucky"" with more consistency than most pitchers. My point is that this year, in particular, his BABIP is nearly 50 points lower than his career average, which I already outlined is 50 points lower than league averages! It's unsustainable. Also, he's currently owning a career best ERA with a SIERA/xFIP split that is among the worst in the majors this year. You really can't find a bigger discrepancy between underlying stats and actual results right now.   As for the run line, at the current prices, I might be more inclined, but I was able to lock the money line in at a very good price (-128). I probably only take 4-6 run lines each season due to variance in baseball. I love Oakland’s chances for scoring today, but something like a 7-6 win wouldn’t surprise me either.  Think of it this way, -145 odds means that the A's are implied to have a 59% chance of winning. I personally believe it to be closer to 70%. I don’t care if they win by 1 run or 20. If you asked me how many times they will win by more than 1 run, my confidence in predicting a percentage drops dramatically."
sportsbook,3b957t,VirtuaSaturn,2,Sat Jun 27 16:53:56 2015 UTC,"If his BABIP is so low at the moment, why would it be certain to regress toward league average so soon? If he has the same really good defenders around him, and he has the same pitching style that'll get the ball to them in a manner in which they can play it, and he himself is so tall and good at handling balls in play himself, so much better than a replacement pitcher, then why are we assuming his BABIP is 100% luck and sure to regress without a change in the defenders in the infield?  I'm obviously not a sabermetric genius, but I was thinking about BABIP last night and that occurred to me."

I dont know anything about TLO or Ianusoi (whatever that stupid name is) gonna stay away from this until i see them play.  I assume your bet above is Harstem over firecake?

With the way Impulse has been performing it is really hard to give them an edge in this match.  Their aggression can sometimes snowball them into a win but if a team has prepared for them they are in trouble.  This brings us to perhaps one of the sleeper top 3 in NA, Gravity.  They will be prepared for the one dimensional play of Impulse and will dismantle it.  With Move playing a support role in the jungle, he has been able to get his lanes moving.  Last week we saw Gravity dismantle Team 8 and play a super close game with TSM.  At the end of the TSM game, the gold gap was only 4k.  This means that if the last team fight had gone Gravity's way, they would have won it.  Of course those late game teamfights are super important but Gravity showed that they have early and mid game down.  If their late game shotcalling comes to form they will be competing with Team Liquid for top 3 in NA in my opinion.   4 units on Gravity here as I think they should be heavier favorites.  Plus we have reached a point where fan vote is somewhat predictive.  Fan vote has been 77% accurate through the first half.  In a 50/50 game we have to respect the fan vote pick.        Team Liquid 2.36 vs Counter Logic Gaming 1.58 - Liquid blue side/CLG fan vote.  As great as CLG looks right now I believe Team Liquid holds a lot of value here.  Let's break it down, Liquid is 5-3 right now with losses to TSM, Dignitas, and Gravity.  The TSM and Dignitas games were very very close with the Dig game going 53 minutes. The only game that is a red flag for us is the Gravity game where Liquid got completely dominated.  CLG has looked great but we have to look at the last five times these teams have met...Liquid is 5-0 against them.  This is the piece of the puzzle that indicates value here.  If we sweep the bad loss to Gravity aside, these teams look very similar.  Both have lost to TSM this split.  In the end, it is tough to hit CLG at 1.5 as it indicates CLG needs to win 70% of their games.  With a 0-5 record against Liquid, those implied odds are tough to back.  Liquid 3 units.       Team Solo Mid 1.17 vs Team 8 4.91 - TSM blue side/fan vote.  Previously I was somewhat worried when TSM dropped a match to Dig but Dig has proven that they are for real this split so the loss is not as troubling.  With the recent news surrounding Wildturtle possibly being replaced, look for TSM to step up here and make a statement.  Goldenglue is no match for Bjergson in the mid lane.  I would say it is safe to go big here or include in a parlay. 8 units       Cloud 9 1.31 vs. Team Dragon Knights 3.43 - C9 blue side/fan vote.  I would love to say we can bet TDK here but I do not have faith in them.  Ninja and Emperor will once again not be playing.  I believe every week Cloud 9 has to mesh with Incarnation, the better they will be.  We haven't seen much from them yet but they should take this game easily.  4 units       Team Dignitas 1.39 vs. Enemy Esports 2.96 - Dignitas blue side/fan vote. With the addition of Helios and Gamsu finally being able to show he is a top tier top laner, Dignitas is a team to be respected.

I will post another lineup below the Top 5s in case you want advice on setting a lineup skipping most of TSM.     Lineup:  Top-Dyrus  Jungler-Kez  Mid-Bjergsen(Shotcaller)  ADC-Corejj  Support-Kiwikid  Flex-Gamsu  Flex-Ninja(Mancloud)  Flex-Emperor(Lattman)     Explanation: This was a really hard week to do because if you want TSM in any capacity you need to take TDK or T8 players.  Now I want TSM because T8 has proven time and again that against all teams good or bad they hemorrhage Fpts. That being said I could only take two without killing myself.  Lustboy is high projected and high value but I cut him first as I think TSM could get a lot of kills off midlane and top before Lustboy has a chance to roam.  Goldenglue has been in the LCS before but I don't expect him to beat Bjergsen in any capacity.  I expect Bjergsen to go huge this game and I have him at shotcaller as he's projected in the high 30s. Dyrus is a great buy because his cost is still pretty low for how well he has been playing and how well TSM has been facilitating his new play style.  After buying these two it leaves you with a decent amount of money but still needing to be frugal to avoid having to get T8 players.  Dignitas going up against NME is a good game for some value.  Gamsu has been out of control good and Dignitas as a team has looked strong.  I don't believe NME will have the experience to stop the Dignitas momentum and NME is on the high end of the spectrum for giving up points to ADCs and Tops.  I avoided Shiphtur as NME is surprisingly good at keeping mids down as they give up only 18 pts on average to opposing mid laners.  Kiwi and Corejj should have solid games out of the bot lane and with these two you max out your Dig players.  This leaves you with very little money.  Now TDK lost to T8 but played decently, especially Mancloud, Lattman and Kez.  I realize C9 is not as bad as T8 but for the incredibly small salaries TDK's players are listed at I think they will still turn good value.  I have faith that TDK is starting to feel pretty good with their roster and can get decent enough points to make their bottom tier salaries worth it.  This rounds out the roster, very large investment into TSM and tomorrow you should be rooting for T8 to keep it close and bloody to give time for Bjergsen to rack up points.       Top 5 Projected Scorers  -Bjergsen  -Lustboy  -Dyrus  -Santorin  -Wildturtle  Top 5 Value Players  -Dyrus  -Lustboy  -Bjergsen  -Santorin  -Kiwikid     Alternate Lineup  Top-Dyrus  Jungle-Meteos  Mid-Incarnation  ADC-Corejj  Support-Kiwikid  Flex-Gamsu  Flex-Balls  Flex-Hauntzer     This roster is just assuming TDK will continue to be a punching bag for struggling teams and C9 is about to have a field day with the sub squad.  Hauntzer is plugged in because he is very consistent player and GRV has looked strong.  Dyrus for the value and Dignitas because of the reasons stated above.     Thanks for reading and play safe this week, 50/50s and Double Ups all day.

Well I actually couldn't find much info on Gonzalez' reach and must've misread something because I thought he had a 68 inch reach to Silva's 72....turns out Gonzo has a 73 inch reach so that might've been some dumb luck."

Also, since you seem like a pretty serious MMA better, my anecdotal MMA betting evidence (usually while/after drink a bunch of beers) is that betting on underdogs usually does better than betting on favorites.  I may just still be bitter from losing a ton of money betting on favorites when every underdog won on the UFC card a few months back..."

sportsbook,3b84ga,Badmmagambler,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:17:25 2015 UTC,"Did you take into account that Gonzalez missed weight by a significant margin? Also, I'm sure someone has asked you this before but how are your numbers generated and how can you have such specific probabilities?"
sportsbook,3b84ga,UnsafeReload,2,Sat Jun 27 00:35:16 2015 UTC,"Not in the least, I placed these bets Thursday and haven't been paying attention since to be frank. Not too sure what to think about the miss in weight since my model doesn't account for that. There's an awkward line between pure faith in a possibly flawed model and changing bets at the last minute and having a statistically meaningless track record that's impossible to analyse.   I generate my numbers using scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library. The probabilities of course are not that specific, but I have to work with the output of my model as given.   Right now my goal is to post these picks as a way to be publicly accountable and have results that are completely free from any sort of data massaging during the model building stage. In perhaps six months I'll review to see how it worked out."
sportsbook,3b84ga,nms9807,3,Sat Jun 27 01:50:16 2015 UTC,I like Machida by TKO at +180.  Romero has massive power as well so I don'tsee this going 5 rounds.     Small cage for this card which means more finishes.  I'm on the under for most of these fights.

sportsbook,3b84ga,nms9807,2,Sat Jun 27 07:42:58 2015 UTC,"Before I start, here's a fun fact about the last Bellator show. There were only 2 decisions on the entire card (2/14 fights). Bellator 137? 4 decisions. (4/13 fights). The more Bellator I watch, the more it seems fights don't go the distance.  BELLATOR PICKS  I fucking love Volkov tonight. Heavy hitting young heavyweight against an old heavyweight coming off a loss to a much, much smaller Mo Lawal.. Volkov did just lose to Tony Johnson but I have no doubt he can bounce back. Volkov could be a top 5 guy in the UFC right now, easily competing with the likes of Miocic, Browne and Arlovski. I have no doubt he'll be there one day as he's one of the only young prospects the heavyweight division has.  Tony Johnson was able to grind out a split decision win against Volkov with wrestling/dirty boxing.. I hate that shit. Cheick Kongo isn't a guy who will wrestlefuck you to a points win. This will end by stoppage. I think Volkov will TKO old man Kongo.  1u Volkov inside distance (EVEN)  2u Fight doesn't go the distance (-190)  Pat Curran vs Emmanuel Sanchez. This will be a good fight.  I don't know much about Sanchez, but he's taking the fight on 18 days notice. I don't think that's enough time to prepare for a former champion. Curran is coming off of back to back losses to Weichel and Pitbull. Both guys are tough mother fuckers. I see him bouncing back with a win.  1u Curran inside distance (+170)  1u Fight doesn't go the distance (+115)  Not much to say about this last fight. Rickels vs Alessio.  I don't think either guy will finish this fight. Alessio has went to decision all the way back to August 2011 when he subbed Shawn Fitzsimmons, he's had 7 fights since then (6 decisions, 1 NC). Rickels only has two finishes in his last 6 wins. 5 of his last 9 went to decision and two of the finishes were him getting KO'ed by Chandler and Patricky Pitbull. I don't see Alessio KO'ing anyone.  1u Rickles via 3 round decisions (+160)  1u Fight goes distance (-180)"
sportsbook,3b84ga,BurtDickinson,2,Fri Jun 26 20:47:01 2015 UTC,"Kongo is quite likely to use wall & stall and wrestling against Volkov like journeyman Tony Johnson did. Whether he will be successful or not remains to be seen, but I think you're overrating Volkov and under-rating Kongo in this regard. I personally like Kongo as a dog here and Kongo DEC. I bet the over 1½ rounds too as a hedge for either guy winning, because Kongo has pretty good recovery even if Volkov catches him on the chin at some point.    I like Curan ITD small and simply bet the over 2½ in the Rickels/Alessio fight to cover either guy winning a dec or late stoppage. Also paid the juice on Joe Schilling in what I consider to be a set-p fight against a striker to look good for Bellator."
sportsbook,3b84ga,UnsafeReload,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:55:06 2015 UTC,"It's possible. I'd really like to see Volkov improve and learn to use his reach which he doesn't really utilize enough. I may be a bit biased towards Volkov and don't encourage anyone to follow my picks but I like posting to have a discussion about them.   The only thing that worries me is Kongo is 40 years old, has a lot of mileage on his body and has been in too many wars for my liking. I don't know if his chin will hold up.   Either way I'd rather lose money betting on a guy I'm rooting for than betting against someone I enjoy and want to win."
sportsbook,3b84ga,Badmmagambler,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:00:33 2015 UTC,"I might actually throw half a unit on Kongo via decision at +350. That will pretty much cover my ass even if Volkov doesn't finish him.  I don't know about Schilling man. There's a reason the guy is 2-4, but you're right in the fact Kato probably won't take him to the ground where he seems as experienced as Kimbo. I don't think I feel safe betting on Schilling when I don't even know anything about the guy he's fighting. I'm sure he's just a can to warm up Schilling and get him at least closer to .500, but good god man...he looked like he was just plain lost on the ground against Carvalho."
sportsbook,3b84ga,Badmmagambler,2,Fri Jun 26 21:08:14 2015 UTC,"I've got about .75u on Romero inside the distance. Machida was probably concussed in his last fight and that was less than three months ago. They're in the smaller cage so this shouldn't last long one way or the other.

Yoel struggled against Kennedy and should have lost when he couldnt answer the bell. Machida has been in there with the best at 205 and 185 and has some of the best counter attacks in MMA. Yoel also doesnt have the gas tank to go past the 1st round with Lyoto. Machida inside the distance imo

Machida is a top MW and LHW and Yoel should have lost his last fight when he couldnt answer the 3 round at first. Romero has too much muscle mass for cardio and has known to gas while Machida has fought multiple 5 round fights. Smaller cage makes me believe Romero will try to rush Machida but Machida is one of the best counter fighters in the UFC today.

sportsbook,3b8rn2,whorunit,0,Sat Jun 27 04:45:33 2015 UTC,"Yes. imo, Rockhold is the one to take the belt from Weidman when they meet later in the year. Machida has been at the top of both divisions for so long and I dont foresee Yoel taking that jump over Lyoto. Machida was getting the better of Rockhold in the stand up until Luke used his size advantage to dismantle Machida on the ground. Yoel doesnt have the grappling chops to do the same. Yoel's going to tire and walk into a counter right ala Ryan Bader"

sportsbook,3b4v09,rs1x,10,Fri Jun 26 00:01:06 2015 UTC,"Verified Record  This Day in Baseball History: (1970) For all my fellow O's fans out there, Frank Robinson hits two grand slams in the same game, helping Baltimore to beat the Senators, 12-2. The Oriole outfielder, who accomplishes the feat in consecutive at bats, is the seventh major leaguer to hit two bases-full homers in one game.  ATL @ PIT  The Barves will probably be looking to get some aggression out today after being broomed by the Nationals. The Buccos are in the same boat after dropping two to the Reds, and probably have a better shot tonight with Liriano on the mound. The Barves lineup is weak against LHP (but not awful), slashing .238/.305/.327 against them. However, they also struggle against K-pitchers like Liriano, posting a .606 OPS against similar talent, and a .645 OPS against groundball pitchers. Williams Perez's FIP/ERA differential is telling (4.32 FIP/2.78 ERA), as is his ungodly 84.4% LOB rate. I was burned by the Pirates earlier in the week (fucking Mike Leake), but still feel good about their chances against groundballing dual first-name pitcher Perez (seriously, Williams Perez...Perez Williams...get a first name bro). Pittsburgh bats .274/.342/.376 against GB pitchers and should end their batting slump today at PNC (famous last words, right?) The problem here, is the egregious price they put on this game. -210 for Liriano? Are you out of your fucking mind Vegas? There is no world where this game is worth playing at that price. No play.  WAS @ PHI  Another game that's priced out of the market for me. Judging by the cruel baseball gods, Scherzer will probably get shelled tonight by the lifeless Phillies, because one of the few things the basement-dwelling Phanatics are good at is shitting on solid bets. I'm not touching Scherzer at -220, and neither should you.  TEX @ TOR  Ah, the Blue Jays collapse is nigh. I feel it in my bones. This game is a matchup of two overperforming pitchers whose metrics don't equal their performance. Martinez's 2.77 ERA is incredibly misleading as his 4.31 FIP indicates. Martinez isn't really a strikeout guy, he doesn't give up a bunch of dongers but he doesn't induce a huge amount of groundballs either. He is bound to be shelled eventually, and why not against one of the league's best home-hitting teams? The worry here is that Buehrle isn't that great himself, but should scrape by against the poor-LHP hitting Rangers (who also are batting .229/.298/.369 on the road). Price on this game is pretty steep too, but Blue Jays ML (-169) seems safe to me.  CLE @ BAL  This is an interesting matchup. The O's are horrid against K-pitchers, but Klubers' LHB splits are suspect, as they are batting .286/.355/.421 against him this season. The Orioles can load their lineup with 6 lefties if need be (Parmelee, Davis, Paredes, Snider, Wieters, Flaherty) and the team collectively has generally been on fire over the last 7 days (.324/.367/.495). Chen struggles against RHBs, but the Indians don't have too many quality righty bats in their lineups (Lindor, Santana, Raburn). I don't think I'll touch the ML one way or the other in this game as I think the chances of Kluber going to town on the O's are the same as them taking him out of the game early, but it's probable that each team notches a few runs. I've been liking this ""no runs in the 1st"" prop, but after looking at Kluber's 1st inning stats, I'm not liking that here (owns a 8.40 ERA in the 1st). Overall this is a ""no play"" for me.  BOS @ TB  Eesh, how's that Porcello contract looking right now Boston? Rickie hasn't lived up to expectations this year, posting a 4.45 FIP/5.61 ERA. His road splits are BAD, and I mean BAD. Batters on the road are hitting .305/.356/.503...LHBs on the road own an .868 OPS against him (.373 wOBA). Granted, the Rays don't have much in terms of LHBs (Kiermaier, Asdrubal, DeJesus) and Porcello did hold the Rays down this season once before, throwing 7 scoreless innings. On the other side the Rays have Alex Colome on the mound, whose stats are pretty similar to Porcellos (read: shitty). Colome has been particularly bad at home, where batters hit .320/.377/.563 against him (.403 wOBA) and LHBs own an OPS over 1.00 against him. I'd like to think that Brock Holt will probably have a killer game today, and Ortiz might actually get a hit. Beyond that the Sox are hitting better than the Rays at the moment, so I'll go with the hotter-hitting team with the better lineup here. The dog odds are especially appealing here with the Red Sox ML (+106).   MIN @ MIL  I don't really understand this line; Lohse has been poor, sporting a 4.97 FIP/6.30 ERA and 1.79 HR/9. The Twins haven't been great on the road, but are decent against fly-ballers like Lohse, sporting a .739 OPS against them. What I don't really understand is why May isn't getting any love here. His 3.10 FIP/4.03 ERA and .333 BAbip indicate he's been unlucky and he's done a good job of keeping the ball in the yard. The Brewers bats have been ""better"" (because they really couldn't have gotten too much worse), but don't outshine Lohse's clear deficiencies and poor home splits. What I don't like is the Twins' 'pen numbers, so I might play Twins 5i before I played the Twins ML (+108). If you don't feel like getting ""cute"", then the Twins ML isn't a bad bet, especially considering the amount of powerful RHBs in their lineup which should match up well against Lohse's poor home RHB splits.  KC @ OAK  Okay, I get it, Vegas is paying its respects to the hot-hitting A's, who have drastically improved their offensive stats over the last week or two. But in any case, the Royals are one of the best groundball-pitcher hitting teams in the league and shouldn't have a problem getting to Hahn early. I guess my worry here would be the A's offense matching up against Volquez, who has been pretty middle-of-the-road. But quite honestly, it's hard to pass up on the Royals with plus-odds. Taking the Royals ML (+113)."

sportsbook,3b4v09,weechigo,7,Sat Jun 27 04:53:59 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Whoops, forgot the link: Here  So I've fixed my spreadsheet and automated a ton of the stuff like importing games,, start times, lines, win/loss and even got live scores in the sheet (although that seems to be refreshing whenever it feels like it instead of once a minute like it's supposed to). The live scores also show if a bet is currently winning, losing or pushing during each game. I had created a special function to be able to have a countdown until each game starts so those who view it know how long they have to place bets on each game but as the refresh is not working well it would be kind of pointless if it was showing 40 minutes until game starts for 1.5 hours, so that's out for now.  When I have time I will look into feeding the picks from the users automatically into the sheet, but that's a bonus feature that can wait.  Any feedback would be appreciated. I'm iffy on the O/U since these are just the opening lines and they seem to be quite different than what the tipsters are betting on a lot of the time, so maybe I'll either work it so the lines are maybe not the opening lines but maybe the lines 5 hours or something before the first game starts.  It's also looking like a lot of useless information with all lines for every outright winner and every O/U, even if no user is betting on it, so maybe I'll ditch the O/U or maybe I'll create another sheet showing only bets that tipsters have picked. It's just so many rows of cells for each day, I don't really like it. But again, that's a bonus feature that I don't know if I will spare time for just now.  I'm still trying to make the automation even easier for me so there may be some changes in the next few days or so, google spreadsheets is very clever in many ways but in some ways Excel is far superior (like ""copying"" formulas by drawing the cell up/down/sideways, Excel allows to do that without messing up formatting like background color and borders but Google Spreadsheet seems unable to keep formatting (or can it?)).   Hoping to be able to plug in some historical data of picks soon to increase sample size and ""reliability"" of data analysis, but I think I'm going wait on doing it manual until I see kind of automation I can use to make that as easy as possible.  Picks only in from 2/6 users, not many good spots today with some tipsters having said they are not betting on anything. One double combo, two  single picks so far."

Similarly out of those 5 games it likes the Royals to win the least out of those 5 teams. However at positive odds it slightly edges out the Astros.

Series picks for this weekend:   Brewers -140 over Twins - I love Milwaukee at home. I hate Twins away from Target. I don't think May, Gibson and Milone can take 2 wins from the Brewers. All three are average pitchers and Miller Park eats average pitchers alive, especially guys who are susceptible to the long ball. Gibson will get shelled for a few, I could see Milone giving up a couple.   Also no DH for the Twins and taking the bat out of Vargas' hot hands will help the Brewers. I could also see both Mauer and Suzuki getting a day of Sunday, maybe even Torii. I'm a sucker for AL teams playing in NL parks, because firstly the managers aren't as accustomed to playing with no DH, and secondly the pitchers are an easy out 95% of the time. Rays -160 over Red Sox - Jesus....Porcello, Miley and Masterson. The new big three. Tampa Bay should be having batting practice all weekend off these guys. Colome and Andriese should be able to at least steal a single win, especially after Colome threw a 7 inning 1-hitter Sunday. Archer is untouchable and should easily pitch to a win.  Who isn't hurt in Boston? Pedroia is on the DL, Hanley is ""banged up"" and not starting tonight. Sandoval was injured earlier this week and Ortiz just can't hit. This team is injured, bruised and cold.  Boston hasn't won a series against an AL team since April. Their series record is 2-8-1 against AL East teams this year, including 0-2 against Tampa. With no Pedroia, possibly no Hanley, and no good starting pitching, give me Tampa all weekend long. Orioles -125 over Indians - Baltimore at home is dangerous. One of the best home records in the AL. They're starting to heat up lately too which should terrify opposing starting pitchers.   Baltimore hasn't lost a series since Houston took 3 of 4 three weeks ago, since then they're 6-0 including taking 2 of 3 at Cleveland.   As far as the pitching matchups go, it's ridiculous. Chen vs Kluber. You would assume Kluber is the more dangerous starter, but Chen has much, much better stats. He's been a lot more consistent and shut out Philly through 8 innings with 9 strikeouts last week. The ""fatigue"" thing worries me, but not enough to change my entire prediction. Tillman vs Anderson. Yuck. I don't like either guy. Jimenez vs Bauer. Both are similar guys. High strikeouts, high WHIP, lots of high leverage situations.  I think this will be a high scoring series. Baltimore has way more offense to go around and I believe they'll take this one with their hot bats."

sportsbook,3b4lph,rdfiii,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:56:49 2015 UTC,"Very possible, but just note that if you are basing their defensive ability (and maybe you aren't) on their games so far this WC keep in mind that neither team has played another team remotely comparable to the one they are about to face. The closest comparison Germany has faced was Sweden who managed to score one goal and the closest France has faced was Colombia who scored 2 goals. I just wanted to point this out to acknowledge that these teams may have good defense but I don't think it has been quite as suffocating as say the U.S. Who have only allowed 1 goal thus far while playing more difficult teams than both France and Germany has.  Another side note is that Germany will be without one of their veteran defenders who is missing the match due to yellow cards   BOL"
sportsbook,3b4lph,IWasRightOnce,2,Fri Jun 26 14:06:01 2015 UTC,"Just looking at the teams they played: Colombia, England, Norway were better than expected and Sweden (with an extension the USA) wasn't as good either.

Gambit is a mediocre team at best. This should be an easy win.    Result: Win    Origen is currently placed second in the EU LCS with a 7-2 record. They are stronger than their opposition in every single aspect of the game: Individual talent, experience, and strategy. Copenhagen Wolves are also still in the same dire situation that I explained in yesterday's post, but this time they face even tougher opposition.    Result: Win    H2k is currently in shared second (third by tie-breaker) at 7-2. They are second only to Fnatic when it comes to the strategical aspect of the game, and thus outclass today's opposition (SK Gaming) significantly, who are shared bottom of the table.    Result: Loss, unfortunately.    The odds for these matches are correct and therefor low, but I think that a treble still holds good value. The top three teams are a clear step above the rest of the teams in the league, and an upset is unlikely.    LCS Betting Record: 29 wins 10 losses"

Giants looked pretty solid today beating Unicorns of Love and therefore I'm taking Werlyb in the top lane and Godfred in the bot lane going up against Elements hoping win or lose it is as bloody as EL vs SK was today.  ROCCAT again in the lineup, slightly less scary as they did look good today but they were going against a Copenhagen Wolves team that is in shambles.  Nonetheless, UoL threw a big lead today and I think ROCCAT has a chance to keep it close and make it a hard fought game.  UoL is middle of the pack for giving up fpts to midlaners but with Nukeduck at only $959 he is great value.  If he scores anywhere in the mid teens it will have been worth it.  On the other hand UoL gives up 17% more fpts to opposing junglers than the LCS average and therefore I'm taking Jankos to pair with Nukeduck.  Now the value picks are done it's time to throw down major cash for big scorers.  SK gives up fpts, the most to every position, win or lose.  I think H2K vs SK could be closer than expected but H2K will most likely win and bring in points.  Hjarnan is expensive, but still well worth it.  I expect at least 30 pts going up against a SK team that gives up 60% more fpts than the LCS average to opposing ADCs.  He's in all my lineups as shotcaller.  To max out the 3 players per team on H2K I went with Ryu who is consistent and relatively cheap for a player going against SK.  Kasing is the highest value this week because of his low salary and the fact that SK gives up 62% more fpts than the LCS average against opposing supports.  To finish out my flex spots I'll be plugging in Reignover who is going against a GMB team that just got crushed by ORG who FNC has proven they are better than.  Whether or not you think GMB will turn it around, tomorrow is not the day they're going to keep a team from scoring big.  Reignover is only $1,485 and GMB gives up 20 fpts a game to junglers on average and the only junglers they kept under 18 were Frederic, Airwaks and Sven(before SK started playing well).     Top 5 Projected Scorers  -Hjarnan  -Kasing  -Ryu  -Reignover  -Rekkles  Top 5 Value Players  -Kasing  -Hjarnan  -Ryu  -Reignover  -Jankos     Referral link: https://vulcun.com/f/Benwa   Use this for 100% deposit bonus.  www.reddit.com/r/esportsbook  Add Benwadabeast on KiK for esports chat."

The reason I'm doing a single bet here is because I believe the line is still off @ 1.2  I believe this should be more around 1.1 or so.  Origen looked back in form yesterday and with CW being a broken team at the moment, Origen will look to absolutely dismantle them.  Origen is motivated and needs every win they can get to contend with H2K for second place.       100% with /u/Kashin today in that one of the best plays of today is Origen, Fnatic, H2K parlay at 2.00.  Kashin is absolutely correct in that these three teams are very much in a different tier than the rest of the EU LCS.  I would go 5 units on this.       Elements over Giants @ 2.5 - Giants blue side/fan vote.  Both these teams yesterday won in a super sloppy fashion.  Elements went back and forth with SK all game while Giants somehow pulled off a win against Unicorns by bashing into them repeatedly.  I believe the odds here are accurate but I would say that a slight edge goes to Elements as the roster swap to Nyph (their former player and current coach) seems to have revitalized them.  Their strategies looked slightly cleaner.  If they can keep calm under the aggression of Giants early then they should be able to take this win.  Jwaow in the top lane can single handedly carry them. Skip or 1-2 units on Elements       Unicorns over Roccat @ 1.4 - Roccat blue side/Unicorns fan vote.  If the odds somehow go above 1.5 for Unicorns, I would say hit it lightly.  Unicorns should win this game.  Roccat struggled to close out against a broken CW yesterday.  Roccat still shows a bunch of weakness in their play.  I do not think that swapping ADC's has solved any of their issues.  Unicorns are the guys with early aggression in an attempt to snowball and I expect them to camp the shit out of Steve in the top lane.

sportsbook,3b0i7j,MEXTASIS,8,Thu Jun 25 14:52:48 2015 UTC,"verified record  This Day in Baseball History: (1996) With his White Sox trailing 9-2, second baseman Tadahito Iguchi hit a three-run bomb in the eighth and then delivered a game-tying grand slam in the ninth during an eventual 13-inning loss to the Astros at U.S. Cellular Field. Teammates Scott Podsednik (6/23) and Joe Crede (6/24) had also hit home runs with the bases full in the two previous games of the series, making it the first time in team history a grand slam was hit in three consecutive games.  Wow yesterday was one of my worst days in recent memory, possibly all season. WELP I'm getting back on the horse...some better matchups today should yield better results.  CWS @ DET  Carlos Rodon will be good one day...but right now he's an unfinished product who walks batters like it's going out of style. Beyond that his vs RHB splits are pretty poor as righties have bat .299/.403/.395 against him this season. The Tigs lineup probably won't have a single lefty in it today...all RHB and switch-hitters, which is bad news for Rodon. Opposing him is 'Fredo, a finesse pitcher who's also had his own control issues this season. My worry is that the White Sox offense has looked ""better"" over the last few games (.282/.338/.399 over the last 6 games). Anyway, I'm leaning toward playing Tigers ML (-150) but I'll see if anyone else weighs in on this and make my decision after that.  OAK @ TEX  Yeesh the Rangers' bats have looked bad over the last two weeks. Over their last 5 games they are batting .213/.280/.331, and over the last 14 days they've bat .239/.301/.378. Meanwhile the A's have slowly but surely clawed their way back to decency, posting a .847 OPS over the last week and .811 OPS over the last two. Colby Lewis who has been oddly good this year (compared to his career numbers) has a problem with LHB's making good contact off of him, and though the A's don't have many of those, Vogt and Reddick could pose a threat to his outing. This is a ""feeling"" call here, with Sonny Gray (whose road FIP is better than his home one) on the mound I like the A's chances of taking the series from Texas. I like the A's ML (-152).  NYM @ MIL  This is a ""stay away"" game in terms of the moneyline, but I'll give y'all some insight on it anyway. With deGrom on the mound for the Mets they are the clear ""favorite"" here based solely on him and nothing else really. As for the Mets offense, they have gone 100% AWOL over the last two weeks. This week they're batting .167/.220/.263 (yes, that's a .483 OPS). Part of that has been their road trip as they are one of the worst road-hitting teams in the league. Another part of that is that they'd actually been performing above their ceiling anyway, and what you're seeing now is probably a little bit closer as to what you can expect for the rest of the duration (at least until they make their ""big trade"" and David Wright comes back). Sure, they could snap out of it today, but what is more likely is that this game will be ""the first to get 2 runs wins"". The Brewers, as good as their bats have been, are piss poor against strikeout pitchers (to the tune of .199/.268/.316) and deGrom doesn't really have any glaring deficiencies. I considered under 7 runs, but that seems too risky for me (especially since I'm trying to be more selective), so this is a no play.  LAD @ CHC  This has been a great series thusfar. Neither team is swinging the bat particularly well right now (or at least up to their potential), so this to me is more of a pitcher's game than anything. Frias is a heavy groundball pitcher, who has had mixed results so far this year. The Cubs actually hit GB pitching better than any other subset, slashing .281/.357/.410 against similar pitchers. Lester is also a groundball pitcher (a little less so than Frias), and it seems the Dodgers are slightly deficient in every aspect of the Lester v LA matchup; the Dodgers hit southpaws worse than RHP, they bat .229/.316/.364 against power pitchers and .244/.321/.395 against GB pitchers. Lester is also due to perform better based on metrics (.327 BAbip, 3.57 FIP/3.80 ERA). I like the price here, so I'm taking Cubbies ML (-125).  ARI @ COL  Two of my favorite offenses to watch, along with two of my favorite De La Rosa's to watch (also the only two De La Rosa's I know) makes this a pretty interesting matchup. In the interest of this not being confusing, I'll use first names. Rubby is a groundball pitcher, and the Rockies slash .290/.349/.445 against said pitchers. Jorge is ALSO a groundball pitcher (and also a power pitcher), and the Dbags don't fare as well against groundballers, slashing .236/.304/.341 against them. Beyond that, the Rockies offense looks better at the moment all the way around (I mean they own a .902 OPS over their last 5 games, .200 higher than the Dbags) so I like their chances tonight. Rockies ML (-130).  As of now, that's what I'm playing. Good luck!"

sportsbook,3b0i7j,vanellopee,11,Thu Jun 25 21:16:58 2015 UTC,"Not sure I understand this Boston -120 line. Miguel Gonzalez has had nothing but problems in his 3 starts against the Sox so far this season. All told, he’s gone 15.1 IP in his 3 starts vs Boston, with 17 hits, 7 walks, 7 ER, and 3 homers allowed. The Orioles somehow won 2 of those 3 starts, which might be why the are only a short road dog, but when a guy posts SIERAs of 4.51, 6.67, and 6.52 in his 3 outings vs his upcoming opponent, I just don’t think he should get anything better than a +150 line. And it’s not just the Sox that hit Gonzalez, his SIERA/xFIP split of 4.10/4.09 is as mediocre as it’s ever been, and he’s managed to get where he is with a ton of luck, measured via a .235 BABIP, which is low even for Gonzalez. It doesn’t hurt that Boston’s lineup is among the hottest in baseball at the moment. Feels like the books are slow to adjust on a team that’s struggled most of the season but may have turned a corner in the past week. We’ll find out.     I’m as big of a Sonny Gray fan as anyone, but being someone who really relies on the movement of his fastball to induce grounders, Gray thrives best in high air density conditions (like the way it is almost every single day in Oakland). Unfortunately for Sonny, the forecasted air density for Texas on Thursday afternoon is a notch below 60 and that could lead to some flat fastballs to some pretty elite LHB who can take advantage. Not that the A’s won’t enjoy some offense of their own, facing Colby Lewis under the same circumstances with an offense that is red hot of late, which is why I’m on OAK/TEX Over 8.5 -110.      Underdog special in the Wednesday mid-afternoon match up: Braves +143. Despite being in the bottom 3rd of the majors in most pertinent offensive categories this year, Atlanta is actually middle of the pack vs right handers. I mentioned prior to his last outing that Doug Fister (the righty Atlanta gets to face on Wednesday) is definitely still not healthy. Check out the velocity history  on his main fastball. It was down to start the year, likely due to the forearm tightness that eventually landed him on the DL. Reports following the disclosure of his injury suggested that he may eventually need Tommy John surgery to fix the problem but the Nats rolled the dice and activated him last week, only to see even lower velocity on that fastball. I think he’s cooked and this might be our last chance to fade him before he’s out for the year. Matt Wisler, who starts for the Braves, looked solid in his debut and I defer to the scouting skills of my podcast co-host Charles Kurz, who called Wisler’s strong start last time out and expects similar results going forward. Only concern here is of a delay or postponement due to rain. Here’s hoping they get it in, would love to cash a multi unit underdog."

sportsbook,3b0i7j,VirtuaSaturn,2,Thu Jun 25 20:05:15 2015 UTC,Yup. For the reasons you stated.  http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2011/7/3/2255959/all-innings-are-not-created-equal-how-run-scoring-varies-by-inning
sportsbook,3b0i7j,OnChill,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:19:00 2015 UTC,"My reasoning for betting on this would be that in baseball it takes a while for hitters to figure out pitchers, if they are good. So, good pitchers would normally mean no early scoring."
sportsbook,3b0i7j,PeePeeMartinez,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:54:35 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with this type of bet, I just don't think you can say specific teams never score early, but it worked out, nice."

sportsbook,3b0i7j,CheeseAddiction,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:55:41 2015 UTC,I actually just took the over on 1.5 runs being scored in the first inning of this game at +140.  Gut feeling kind of bet.
sportsbook,3b0i7j,jackie_treehorn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:04:10 2015 UTC,"I've never bet on ""yes"" to the scoring in first inning prop, but I've been tempted to with this game."
sportsbook,3b0i7j,CheeseAddiction,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:10:39 2015 UTC,"A few weeks ago, around early June, I was noticing that the vast majority of games were scoring a run in the 1st. After having been a big fan of no's throughout May, I started flat betting every single ""yes"" for a baby amount (like 10 on each) and I was consistently ending up ahead. But it seems that lately, similar to April/early May, we're back to not having runs again. I wonder if there's some sort of pattern across different times of the season?"

sportsbook,3b0i7j,j3rown,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:06:38 2015 UTC,Opinion on CWS/DET and O's/BRS?
sportsbook,3b0i7j,MEXTASIS,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:49:07 2015 UTC,"I'm still toying with adding CWS/DET for tomorrow. Tigers top of the lineup doesn't have good stats against lefties (except Miggy), and Alfredo Simon puts up good numbers against the White Sox. Neither team has done much early scoring lately. I think it could be a good one. I also think it works to Rodon's advantage that he hasn't faced the Tigers yet. The only thing keeping this from being an automatic pick for me is that the Tigers (particularly Cabrera, Kinsler, and Cespedes) have insane day game batting numbers, and that lineup is always a threat to score. Rodon also tends to get hit hardest early in the game. His opposing batting average for pitches 1-15 in the game is .320 this year."
sportsbook,3b0i7j,CheeseAddiction,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:02:37 2015 UTC,and what about Boston
sportsbook,3b0i7j,MEXTASIS,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:29:52 2015 UTC,"Baltimore is 3rd in 1st inning runs scored and first inning runs allowed, so I like to stay away from them. Eduardo Rodriguez (BOS) has great numbers early in the game (.111 opposing batting average in first 15 pitches), but Miguel Gonzalez (BAL) has an opposing batting average of .304 in his first 15 pitches and has allowed more extra base hits and HRs in first innings this year. He's definitely the kind of guy that needs an inning to settle in. There are too many better games to bet on for me to want to risk this one."

Edit: Sometime you have to click on one of the matchups to isolate that game on the screen before you see the option for the player and team prop links.  And many times, on bova at least, they don't become available until a couple hours or less before gametime. (A's @ Rangers at 2:05 EST does not have the prop available yet...it will in a couple hours.

For record-keeping purposes and for my benefit in getting as many data points for analyzing the results of my model, I am tracking wagers all the way down to .1% of my bankroll.  However, in reality an edge that small is probably not even an edge and not really worth betting as even with a fairly sizeable bankroll, the EV of such a bet would be chump change.

sportsbook,3b0iqo,stander414,4,Thu Jun 25 00:05:18 2015 UTC,"For today's EU LCS: Roccat to beat Copenhagen Wolves @1.83  Neither team is in great form, but Roccat has a theoretical higher ceiling. The important part though, is that Copenhagen Wolves are falling apart from the inside. The coach has lied to the players, this was revealed due to an internal investigation and led to the team being penalized. This has shattered the trust and ruined the team atmosphere irreparably.   TWO of their players have announced that they will be leaving the team due to the bad team atmosphere, one of which is their oldest player and captain.    Result: Win    LCS Betting record: 27 wins 9 losses."
sportsbook,3b0iqo,Kashin,2,Thu Jun 25 01:48:11 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't bet against freeze though. He is good enough to carry against an equally terrible Roccat roster.   Safter bet is Fnatic over H2k. H2k has looked strong recently, but they got stomped by Origen. Fnatic has steamrolled everyone including Origen and arguably outclasses H2k at every position."
sportsbook,3b0iqo,StrategicGambler,2,Thu Jun 25 02:21:45 2015 UTC,"The odds on the Fnatic win are a lot lower, and if anyone is going to end Fnatic's streak it's H2k. Basing who should win on who has beaten who previously is not that useful because of the difference in styles and Origen's propensity to snowball early leads, should they acquire them. After all, Roccat has also beaten Origen.   Fnatic is no doubt the best team in the LCS and them winning this is expected, but I'll actually steer clear of that match. I think Freeze carrying a roster that's completely falling apart is less likely than a solid strategical team beating another solid team."
sportsbook,3b0iqo,Kashin,2,Thu Jun 25 02:38:34 2015 UTC,Solid points. In my experience I've found you're usually better off backing a great team (Fnatic) than a bad team (ROCCAT) regardless of opponent. Hopefully we both get a win tomorrow!
sportsbook,3b0iqo,StrategicGambler,2,Thu Jun 25 03:18:33 2015 UTC,"In the case of Fnatic that has definitely been true this split, and I've bet on them every match thusfar.

Really the circumstances can't get any better for Roccat to pull off a win here. With the current leaked conversations of CW's coach causing major player unrest within CW, I can't imagine practice has gone well this week.  Along with a brand new jungler.  Roccat has now had a week to practice with their new, capable ADC, MrRallez.  Along with all this however, Roccat has still not lived up to the hype or their ""potential"". Looking strictly at both team's wins though, we see that Roccat has beaten Origen and Gambit while CW has only beat SK and Elements.  Roccat's wins are considerably better than CW's wins, combine that with CW's current state and I see a lot of value on Roccat at anything over 1.5.  If you were in the KiK group you got Roccat early at 2.0 when it opened :).  6 units       Giants over Unicorns @ 2.5 - Unicorns blue side/fan vote. My lean here would be Giants but I honestly don't have a good grasp on either of these teams.  They both seem overly aggressive and throw away games early but either over committing to fights or trying to force action.  I predict this game will be bloody and chaotic.  The value would be on Giants but Skip.       Gambit over Origen @3.27 - Origen blue side/fan vote.  Origen has had a ton of hype for a recently promoted team.  After going 5-0, they dropped two games in a row.  The loss to Fnatic was expected, but the loss to Roccat was a surprise.  In that game, Origen looked lost on how to play from behind.  They forced fights while behind that they lost, forcing them even further behind.  Gambit has had another week of practice under their belt and a solid week of scrims (according to Shaun, their coach).  Shaun predicts that they have a good shot to beat Origen so they have strictly been preparing for this match. They are preparing less for Fnatic as Shaun states that they are not quite ready to take on Fnatic and will take a loss.  With this focused preparation, there is a good chance that Gambit can pull off the upset here.  I would also argue that Gambit has been under performing and at some point this season they'll start to click better. 3 units       H2K over Fnatic @2.6 - Fnatic blue side/fan vote. Game of the week right here.  This is going to be a great matchup. H2K could be the only notable threat to Fnatic in the the EU LCS Summer Split. Of course, every other team to take on Fnatic this split has tasted defeat.  The only edge I can see here is this:  Fnatic had to prepare last week for Origen (arguably the third best team currently) while H2K only had to breeze over CW and Giants.  Prolly, coach of H2K stated after their games last week that they had used the previous week to prepare for this matchup.  H2K could have an extra week of preparation here.  Of course, it all comes down to gametime but both teams have shown they have the ability to step it up.  With the extra week, and the extra value, I like H2K here. 2 units       SK Gaming over Elements @1.75 - Elements blue side/fan vote.  When Svenskarren looks good, SK looks good.  Last week Sven looked great and SK got their first 2 wins.  If they've actually figured out how to play around Candypanda, they could start to take down more wins.  The reason for this bet however is that Elements is once again roster swapping.  This may be another case of a coach analyzing play and thinking they can do it better.  Nyph is swapping himself in at support for this week, replacing promisq.  PromisQ has not looked amazing, but he was not the reason for Elements going 2-6.  All this shows is roster instability and with SK looking like they've figured out how to play I lean SK here.  3 units      https://twitter.com/esportsbettor     http://esportsbettor.cappertek.com 81-70 +73 units, 14% ROI over 151 picks     Join us at /r/esportsbook and /r/sportsbook     stander414 on KiK if anyone wants to chat esports"

Copenhagen Wolves are voicing unhappiness with two players leaving or planning to leave.  Going hard against both these teams seems like the intelligent thing to do especially since CW and EL give up major Fpts already.  SK is going against EL and ROC is going against CW.  Both teams are very cheap across the board.  Pick 3 from both of those teams, I would suggest avoiding Candypanda because even when SK plays well he is not carrying.  Fredy, although playing poorly most of the season, is coming off a great game and so is Sven.  These players are historically tilty and I hope they ride the momentum against a faltering Elements.  Fox has been pretty solid all season, SK seems to rally around him playing well and he has looked good so he will fill out my SK three.  I personally am avoiding Nuke and MrRallez only because their lane opponents are very talented players and could mess up their early game even if ROCCAT prevails in the end.  Neither Nukeduck or MrRallez are bad picks I just prefer Jankos/Steve/Vander as I expect Steve to win his lane and if ROC gets ahead early from Jankos ganks then Vander will roam. These cheap buys leave us with plenty of cash to get Niels and Amazing who are extremely expensive and wouldn't be worth it if the rest of our roster wasn't so cheap.  They're going against Gambit who gives up an average of 19 pts to both Junglers and ADCs and in my opinion Niels and Amazing are both above average.  I hope for high 20s low 30s for Niels and Amazing.  Amazing is my shotcaller as I expect a bloody early game that ORG will hopefully come out on top of.     I'm skipping Top Five Scorers/Value as there are a few too many intangibles(roster swaps, turmoil) that aren't accounted for in my numbers and I don't want to contradict my roster.  If you are wondering, the stats say heavy on Elements, so if you believe their recent falters and bringing in their coach to support won't effect them you can go heavy on Elements against ROCCAT or maybe one roster for each side of that match.     Referral link: https://vulcun.com/f/Benwa   Use this for 100% deposit bonus.  www.reddit.com/r/esportsbook  Add Benwadabeast on KiK for esports chat."

sportsbook,3b0e6f,alexfromla,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:38:50 2015 UTC,"Sure.   Baghdatis -1.5 (+155) is saying that he will win by 2 sets essentially, therefore he will not drop a set against Bolleli.   Baghdatis (sets) +1.5 (-445) is the complete opposite of the above bet which means that he will not lose by more than 1.5 sets, therefore he must win just 1 set for this bet to win.  Baghdatis (games) -2 (-124) means that Baghdatis has to win the total games played (so if it is 7-6, 6-3, he would win because his total games is more than Bolleli by more than 2) by at least 2 to push, and over 2 to win.   Because Baghdatis is the favorite in this match, that is why we see his set bet -1.5 as the only positive line here.  Hope I could help."

sportsbook,3aw5tt,plato44,0,Wed Jun 24 20:47:17 2015 UTC,Hi im new in betting could you explain to me what does 1u and 2u mean?
sportsbook,3aw5tt,Andrewlucko,5,Wed Jun 24 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"U=Unit, and Unit is just the ""unit of measure."" Think of 1u as your average betting amount. Most people use around 1-2% of their bankroll (total allotted money for gambling) as a unit. For example, Jack's unit is $50, John's unit is $5, and Jeffrey's unit is $5,000. Their level of risk is different, but each would just say I'm risking 1unit on this or that play.  It's used to make comparisons easier on forums since people can relate to a ""standard"" bet. Also, it avoids people engaging in a dick measuring competition as to how much cash they're throwing on games, which isn't productive.  2u = 2 units, which means that he wants more action on that play relative to the 1u plays. Usually the more units, the more confidence, perceived value, or whatever is behind the pick."

sportsbook,3aw5tt,IllegalThoughts,9,Wed Jun 24 15:32:29 2015 UTC,"Verified Record  This Day in Baseball History: (1993) During the Marlins' fire sale, San Diego goes shopping and acquires Gary Sheffield, Rich Rodriguez, and an unheralded rookie right-hander. The little-known freshman reliever is Trevor Hoffman, who will go on to save 552 games for the Padres during his fifteen and half years with the franchise.  TOR @ TB  This game is a matchup against pitchers who are overperforming and getting pretty fuckin' lucky right now; Estrada (4.24 FIP/3.92 ERA) owns a .255 BAbip while KAAAAAAAAARNS (4.02 FIP/3.53 ERA) has a .265 BAbip. Both Estrada and my main man Karne Asada walk a shit ton of batters, over 3.20 per 9 each. Quite honestly, both Estrada and Karns are pretty similar in terms of peripherals and pitching style (though Estrada is more of a flyball pitcher than Karns). I don't really care for either of them, really. Let's go down the rabbit hole a bit further here. Estrada's road splits aren't great as batters own a .739 OPS and .325 wOBA against him out of Rogers Centre. Unfortunately for the Rays, I don't think they'll be able to truly take advantage of this because Karnye West's home splits are even worse. Batters are hitting .262/.343/.431 (.341 wOBA) against him at the Trop, and his 4.65 FIP at home indicate it's not dumb luck. Right-handed batters are slugging .500 against him at home, which could certainly be a problem against the likes of Donaldson, Bautista and Encarnacion. I guess my problem with this game is that Karns is inconsistent as hell...one moment he's giving up 6 runs to various AL East teams, and at others he's shutting them out. Same with Estrada, who has had success/tribulations against good contact-making offenses. In any case, I think one of these pitchers will fold like an accordian, not sure which one but I like the Jays (-105) as the dog and over 7.5 runs total.  PHI @ NYY  Cole Hamels at plus-odds? Why?! The Phillies are on the verge of SWEEPING THE YANKEES. Let's think about that for a second. The Phillies, who by all accounts have the tenacity of a stroke victim and as much upside as moldy placenta, could very well SWEEP who some brain-dead experts think will win the AL East (side note: the Yankees won't win the division, and probably won't even sniff a Wild Card spot). The Yankees aren't in panic mode right now, but they should be as their suspect rotation has finally been put on blast by a veritable AAA team. Enter the return of perennially ""meh"" Ivan Nova, a career 4.19 FIP guy, who walks a bunch of guys and doesn't strike out too many. Hey here's a weird stat, over their last 6 games, the Phillies own a .840 OPS. That won't last, but they certainly are enjoying their moment in the sun before the eventual fire sale that is bound to take place. Cole Hamels has been pretty good this season but has had good luck as well, and his road splits against RHBs (read: ARod) are a concern. But at plus-odds and out of sheer spite of the Yankees, I'm taking the Phillies ML (+110), over 8 runs total (both Hamels and Nova's day game splits are way worse than their night game ones), and just for fun, ARod will hit a HR (+400).   CWS @ MIN  I really only looked at two things to determine whether or not this game was worth playing, how do the Twinsies do against LHPs, and how do they do against K-pitchers? The answer is they are pretty good against both. Minnesoter is actually better at hitting LHPs than RHPs, and hit power pitchers at a clip of .242/.310/.410 (.720 OPS) which is pretty decent. That being said, this isn't a game worth playing for me. No play.  HOU @ LAA  Holy balls last night's game was NUTS. You know what else is nuts? The 'Stros have hit 12 dongers in a matter of 6 games. They've hit 28 fucking dongers in their last 12 games. Shoemaker has been mediocre this season, and he certainly hasn't really done much of a job keeping the ball in the yard (1.86 HR/9). He's a flyball pitcher, which makes his 15.3% HR/FB% pretty obscene. Not only that, but the Angels haven't done well against K-pitchers like McCullers has been this year so far, as they're slashing .237/.319/.314 against said pitchers. I will GLADLY take the Astros ML at even odds, and putting a small bet on over 7.5 runs total.  OAK @ TEX  Playing this one for several reasons. I don't fade many pitchers as I don't typically believe in it, but with Graveman on the mound for the A's and a LHP throwing for Texas, the Rangers have a clear edge here. Gravement, as bad as he's been is actually lucky he hasn't been worse as hit 4.82 FIP/4.02 ERA indicates. The Rangers are a) better against RHP than LHP, b) better at home than on the road, and c) still own an OPS of .700 against groundball pitchers. The only subset of pitchers that the Rangers struggle with are K-pitchers, and Graveman is about the furthest thing from that. Wandy has been serviceable this year, and the A's LHP splits are pretty laughable. Took Rangers ML (-115).  CIN @ PIT  Pittsburgh should win this game an overwhelming majority of the time. Mike Leake has been okay in June, but two of his last starts came against the Phillies so that doesn't really mean much. Leake has also been way better on the road than at home, but his LHB splits are pretty not good. Beyond that, the Pirates are a good GB-pitcher hitting team (.274/.346/.380) and have Cy Young candidate Gerrit Cole on the mound. Cole has been scary good, posting a 2.58 FIP/1.78 ERA and 9.59 K/9. The Reds aren't a good power-pitcher hitting team and both of Cole's ""worst starts"" came against the Reds, where he let up 3 ER in each contest. Oh yeah, Gerrit Cole hasn't thrown a non-quality start all season. In any case, even though Pittsburgh should win this game handily, I don't see much value in a -190 line. No play.  ATL @ WAS  Washington absolutely destroys GB-pitchers, slashing .293/.355/.432 against them this season. Miller definitely falls into that category with his 50% groundball rate, and he's been incredibly lucky beyond that, posting a 3.27 FIP/1.99 ERA, .240 BAbip. Beyond that, Miller hasn't really faced any elite offensive lineups in stride (which Washington definitely is). Zimm has had some bad luck this year but should be helped by the fact that the Nats offense has been on fire in June (.273/.323/.403) especially over the last two weeks (.301/.354/.437). I like the Nationals ML (-160).  STL @ MIA  Okay this is pretty similar to yesterday for me. Latos has been pretty all over the place, shutting down quality teams like the Nats and then giving up runs in boatloads to weird teams. He has been oddly bad at Marlins Park (even though it's one of the league's most pitcher-friendly parks), especially against lefties. Quite honestly though, on paper I actually like the Marlins lineup right now more than the Cards. The Cardinals have Mark Reynolds, strikeout/double-play extraordinaire batting cleanup and that is incredibly concerning to me. Jaime Garcia has been sick this year, though his road peripherals (higher FIP, higher BAA, higher WHIP, higher BB/9, lower K/9) are of concern to me. Same as yesterday, are the Cards the better team and should they win? Sure, but the matchup is too coin-tossy for me to play. No play.  BAL @ BOS  Blah blah blah everyone is on Buchholz's dick. Line is where it is because Norris' stats...but again, and I'm 100% positive I've said this a few times, remove Norris' starts against Toronto from the season and his stats improve dramatically. Here, I'll even prove it to you. His ERA as it sits is currently 7.57 through 44 IP (37 ER). Remove his two starts against the Blow Jays, and he has a 4.61 ERA through 39 IP. Still not great, but definitely better. Anyway the verdict is pretty split here. The O's are bad against power pitchers like Buchholz, but are great against groundball pitchers (...like Buchholz). They've had success against him in the past, but it's hard to say how they'll fare against him today. I don't like anything here really, even the total is too high for me today. No play.  So that's what I'm playing/not playing today. Feel free to message me with questions."

sportsbook,3aw5tt,bAsebAll1332,13,Wed Jun 24 16:34:24 2015 UTC,"As someone who typically bets a lot of dogs, I haven’t found too many to take of late. One that I really like on Wednesday, however, are the Phillies +117. Cole Hamels, a lefty, should be able to tame the red hot Yankee bats, which are largely lefty as well. Hamels’ .207 wOBA vs LHB is among the league’s best this year, and it comes HR-free. Consider his 9.2 K/9 rate in day games over the past 3 seasons and the fact Wednesday’s forecast calls for clear skies, and the Yankees may be lucky to get on the board. For the Philly offense, they get the pleasure of being the first team to face Ivan Nova in 2015. While I know his rough 2014 numbers are a due mostly to injury, but he got roughed up pretty hard in his last rehab start sporting ratios that were very similar to the ones he posted in his shortened season last year. Feels generous to get plus-money with a known quantity in Hamels vs a question mark in Nova.     It feels silly to betting the Over in a game featuring a pitcher who has double digit strikeouts in 6 straight starts and 7 of his last 8, but that’s exactly what I’m doing on Wednesday with CHW/MIN Over 7 -110. While Sale is definitely been incredible vs either side of the plate so far in 2015, he’s been somewhat average vs RHB in his career. He’s also one of the few aces with worse numbers during the day than he has at night. Minnesota is seen as a horrible offense and that drives the low total (in combination with Sale’s success, of course), but the Twinkies are actually decent vs. southpaws this year, largely thanks to Brian Dozier and Trevor Plouffe. With these two teams being divisional rivals, the Twins lineup has seen their fair share of success vs the Chicago ace over the years. Plouffe has a career BvP average of .300, Dozier has a BvP OPS of .978, and Torii Hunter has 2 HRs in 37 ABs vs Sale. I’m not suggesting the Twins light it up on Wednesday, but with the way Chicago is struggling offensively all year (with no real reason to believe it will end any time soon), you can’t take this Over purely on the stance of it being a cloudy day game and Phil Hughes going for Minnesota, though those are usually two pretty good reasons to take an Over most of the time.      Yes. I’m backing Buchholz -138. Not sure I need to write anything for this one, just go back and see my thoughts on the Theon Greyjoy lookalike who I still consider one of the better pitchers in the game when healthy. Despite his recent struggles, I don’t see any red flags that would point to injury (velocity is still there, for example) and I think it had more to do with his recent opponents being tough to strike out. Buchholz is someone who needs to get 7+ Ks in an outing to be successful, something he’s done in half his starts this year, and with Baltimore K’ing 21.6% of the time (good for 6th worst in the majors), I think Reek gets back on track Wednesday night at Fenway.      I have no reason to think Wednesday’s Texas-Oakland game will be any different from their meeting last time Kendall Graveman faced the Rangers back on April 9th, a game Texas won 10-1. Simply put, Graveman struggles vs lefties, the Rangers have a lot of good lefty bats. Meanwhile, the Athletics struggle vs lefties, and Wandy Rodriguez is a southpaw. Not sure why the line is only Texas -115, but thanks.      Fans attending the second game of the Diamondbacks-Rockies series may want to bring helmets with them if they are sitting in the bleachers. Allen Webster might be the worst starter in baseball at the moment. His K/BB is underwater at 4.91/6.55, he’s allowing 1.64 HR/9, and he’s actually been lucky with a .172 BABIP through two starts. Obviously, we’re working with a very small sample size here, but he’s a career 5.10/5.09 SIERA/xFIP guy after 100+ innings at the major league level. His counterpart, David Hale, isn’t much better. Hale at least has the excuse of pitching at Coors, but even for a Colorado pitcher, his 2.05 HR/9 is high. And don’t let his career HR/9 fool you. He spent the majority of his 98.1 innings with the Braves as a reliever, which can sometime skew things. I think a better indicator of his talent (or lack thereof) was his 4.53/4.02 K/BB rate last year with Atlanta. As usual, the line gets the Coors Field treatment at ARI/COL Over 11 -110, but I’m still taking it with confidence."

I mean, he's good, but he's no Archer, MadBum, or Kershaw. I think he's got good stuff, but really lacks the supporting cast."
sportsbook,3aw5tt,-fry-,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:28:47 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, I mean, you just listed 3 of the most elite pitchers in baseball, so I wouldn't consider Buchholz on that level either. But I see him in the same category as Hamels, Greinke, Gray, Keuchel, Lester, etc, and not a lot of other people do, so I tend to find value in his lines. His biggest issue is pitching with runners on base. His LOB% of 68.7% over the last 3 seasons is ridiculously low and while it might have something to do with how he pitches from the stretch, many times the stat is an indicator of bad luck."
sportsbook,3aw5tt,EL_Apostrophe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:39:37 2015 UTC,"Yea, that wasn't fair. But Gray and Hamels are 2 of my favorite to watch. I rarely get to bet on them because of the shitty teams they play for, but damn, I wish I could. Greinke, I feel, is slightly better just because he poses a threat at the plate as well as on the mound. I personally don't see Buchholz in that category, but I also don't have 15 years of experience in analyzing baseball, so maybe I'm missing something."
sportsbook,3aw5tt,-fry-,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:54:50 2015 UTC,"Well, based purely on SIERA (which, while widely considered to be the best single-stat indicator of pitcher performance, is still admittedly only part of the picture) he is currently 21st in the league this season at 3.30, slightly better than the likes of Greinke, Gray, etc and only a little behind other bigger names (Cueto, Keuchel, etc). I could be wrong, but barring injury, I don't see any other pitcher with a bigger spread between advanced and traditional statistics, which typically equals value."

They are calling up Buck Farmer from Toledo to fill in.   ""Right-hander Buck Farmer, who allowed seven runs and nine hits in five-plus innings of a 12-2 loss to the Los Angeles Angels in his only outing this season May 28, was recalled from Triple-A Toledo to fill in.""

I'm tempted to add Mets/Brewers right now because I don't trust either team to score early, but I also have a hard time putting my faith in Colon and Nelson (particularly Nelson's 14ER allowed in 14 first innings pitched this year).

While last night was a beneficial for the 3 pick side, maybe that should have been a 1 pick. Like have a point system. So if 3 people agree and 0 are on the other side, +3-0=3 point pick.   Tigers game would've been +3-2=1 for the tigers.   Something like that maybe. I hate giving you guys more work. This really isn't a request. Just if you guys get bored. Haha I love the MLB community.

sportsbook,3aw5tt,zambartas,2,Wed Jun 24 08:21:05 2015 UTC,NYY / Phillies O7.5   Is this some sort of trap? These two teams have gone over in 5/6 consecutive games respectively and they are seeing beachballs at the moment. Nova is just back from the DL and Yankees will want to make sure they don't lose a third straight to the Phillies - line seems super low to me
sportsbook,3aw5tt,Always_Correct_Gifs,5,Wed Jun 24 14:39:23 2015 UTC,"This game got filtered out pretty quickly as I did my analysis, so I didn't look at it too closely. But air density is above average, humidity pretty low, and a light wind blowing to first base. Conditions aren't exactly optimal for a home run derby. There's no real history of either pitcher against opposing line ups, that can be good or bad... Phillies are hitting .638 away, .636 in day games, .635 vs RHP, .715 last 7 days, so not exactly crushing it at the plate (but have done well this series). The Yanks are hitting .835 home, .685 in day games, .743 vs LHP, and .907 in the last 7 days. Their numbers are much better, but I like Hamels as a pitcher. I won't usually bet on him because the Phillies suck, but he's a good guy to have on the mound. Anyway, to answer your question, I don't know. I don't usually play O/U unless the weather is primo coupled with a few other factors. Somebody else might have a more solid answer for you, but this is not something I would bet on. El Apostrophe and j3rown usually have 1 or 2 O/U picks, I'd wait for that to come out.  Edit: sorry, misread my notes. There is history on Hamels vs Yanks, and he does well. No real history on Nova vs Phillies."
sportsbook,3aw5tt,SassyCorey,2,Wed Jun 24 09:38:55 2015 UTC,"When you look at a stat like a particular team going over or under over a period of time, you have to look at why that's happening.  Was it a function of the starting pitchers?  The weather?  The location/park factor?  A lot of streaky behavior from teams and individuals are functions of the underlying data.  In games that Hamels has started this year, teams have combined for O7.5 4/10 times.  Combine that with the weather data /u/-fry- posted, and the lack of reliable information on Nova, and I think you have more than enough reason to avoid the OU bet here."
