disney,3e34b4,ImTrenton,29,Tue Jul 21 16:20:43 2015 UTC,I'm surprised by the hate this series gets for the art design. I think it looks fantastic! I really like all of the character designs and the slapstick humor of the series.

disney,3e34b4,vankorgan,7,Tue Jul 21 16:38:23 2015 UTC,Well one of the creators of the he shorts was Paul Prudish who previously worked on Dexter's Lab and Powerpuff Girls which explains the cute look of Donald.
disney,3e34b4,brb1006,5,Tue Jul 21 16:53:57 2015 UTC,"Is there a place to see these online? I keep on seeing post about these shorts, and I'd love to see what everyone is talking about."

disney,3e34b4,Darthdre758,5,Tue Jul 21 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"Mickey and Minnie are straight up adorable as hell. It's true, I think Goofy's the only bad design really."
disney,3e34b4,Bertob_Pls,7,Tue Jul 21 19:22:50 2015 UTC,"I agree, I like them all, save for Goofy. I feel like they took the classic designs, and just made them more modern. They don't look THAT different to Walt's original designs.. I mean, Goofy looks terrible, but the others are really cute, I think."
disney,3e34b4,BlueRafael,5,Tue Jul 21 17:19:55 2015 UTC,"I really like the style of the art, but the shorts themselves don't feel very 'Mickey' to me personally. Sometimes I wonder if I'm watching something like Ren & Stimpy instead of a Mickey cartoon."

disney,3e339w,fupresti,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:48 2015 UTC,But those dinosaurs favored realism more so than the ones seen the this trailer.  Carnotaurus was and still is a pretty scary looking dinosaur in Dinosaur.

disney,3e0u5e,sarahbubblebutt,122,Tue Jul 21 02:44:14 2015 UTC,Always figured he got the name Lucky because of his being resuscitated to life when he appeared to be stillborn.  Then it turns out he's got a Horseshoe shaped pattern of spots right on his back!
disney,3e0u5e,comicbookchick,10,Tue Jul 21 02:46:44 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that was the reason for naming him lucky,  because when they were born they didn't have those spots (what horrid little white rats!)  then it turned out that he had the horseshoe on his back. Roger said that they will call him lucky after the revival, but before the spots."
disney,3e0u5e,sammy0415,6,Tue Jul 21 16:06:56 2015 UTC,I thought that marking was a happy face! The horseshoe makes more sense! Lol
disney,3e0u5e,There-Wolf,31,Tue Jul 21 13:29:52 2015 UTC,"In the 90's when 101 Dalmatians got a short resurgence in popularity there were a lot of Lucky toys and merchandise and all of them had the horseshoe pattern on the back. When I was a kid I had both a stuffed toy and a poster with Lucky, and they both featured the horseshoe prominently."
disney,3e0u5e,besuperhuman,11,Tue Jul 21 07:06:26 2015 UTC,Lucky is my favorite. He was everywhere except now for some reason after the blu ray Patch has been replacing Lucky on all the merchandise =(
disney,3e0u5e,Period-Chopsticks,6,Tue Jul 21 07:52:01 2015 UTC,Probably because Patch got a whole sequel.

disney,3e2ykq,Vidogo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:39:34 2015 UTC,"If anyone has ever ridden the Ratatouille ride in Disneyland Paris, I think that's what they should be copying for an Ant Man ride. Incredibly well done, great mix of live ride elements, moving into 3D projections and motion simulators.  Maybe they could mix that technology with your idea. Anyways - they have the ride technology and now the story that should be brought into the American parks, even if it's just Disneyland (because of the Universal deal).   I don't think Ant-Man will get a sequel any time soon, but I felt like this would be an opportunity to finally get a Marvel ride into the parks   He'll at least be in Captain America 2, maybe The Avengers, and possibly get his sequel to find Janet (I've seen people suggesting a sequel could center around the microverse, since that was an actual storyline from the comics)"
disney,3e2ykq,daybreaker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:51:36 2015 UTC,"Oh don't get me wrong, I would love for them to make a sequel involving the microverse. I just worry that that's too farfetched for the MCU.   But then, Ant-Man's shrinking powers started out as too farfetched for the MCU, and as far as inter-dimensional universe stuff, we already crossed that Rainbow Bridge with Space Viking Gods, imo.  Haven't gotten to ride Ratatouille because I'm bound to the States, but I've heard it's great. I like the idea of something more thrill-packed too, instead of another omnimover ride. Whichever way the imagineers (and their budget) want to go!"

disney,3e1igp,AmbushDM5,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:01 2015 UTC,"In all honesty that is a hard question to answer, it depends on size, subject, and time spent. For example I am currently working on another disney piece funny enough, alice in wonderland but it has so much detail it alot more expensive then this piece. but in short, this piece and one that would be similar to this one would be around 300-400 dollars.   for reference this is the Alice painting, So you can see the amount of detail. It is roughly the same size.  http://imgur.com/2FBRWBn"

disney,3dzzem,roxy_writes,8,Tue Jul 21 01:33:02 2015 UTC,"BING BONG, BING BONG!!!"
disney,3dzzem,Bambi53,6,Tue Jul 21 00:32:42 2015 UTC,"I loved the message. When you experience new things as you get older, emotions get a bit more complicated than just happy, sad, jealous, angry and scared. Mixed feelings can sometimes create some of the most impactful memories too."
disney,3dzzem,rninnj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:12:33 2015 UTC,Especially how mom and dad had all five emotions at the command station!
disney,3dzzem,QuantumKittydynamics,6,Tue Jul 21 12:48:32 2015 UTC,"I struggle every day with depression, and the message that sadness exists for a reason actually really gave me hope. Sadness is there so I can express my problems with life and move forward, it's there to send me towards help and a friendly ear. I feel like it's a lot more manageable now.  Also I loved when Anger talked about curse words, because I'm a profanity fiend. :)"
disney,3dzzem,SaraB13,5,Tue Jul 21 07:18:15 2015 UTC,I LOVE the beginning of the movie when joy comes out and then as they go on explaining the different emotions. I also loved any scene with Anger and fear. They're the best.
disney,3dzzem,canancandy,5,Tue Jul 21 05:37:13 2015 UTC,I like Disgust trying to get Anger to flame up to let in Joy and Sadness ^ me and my niece act it out all the time together because we are super close in age
disney,3dzzem,edit_thesadparts,2,Tue Jul 21 04:17:47 2015 UTC,I love Bing Bong! The whole movie was adorable! My 3 year old loved it.  We may need to make another trip to the movies!
disney,3dzzem,BeyonceIsBetter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:45:40 2015 UTC,"My favorite part was Lava, but that doesn't really count. So my favorite part from the actual movie is when Bing Bong kinda sorta dies and the parents perspective. I also loved the ending credits perspective of random people."
disney,3dzzem,mermaid_quesadilla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:29:31 2015 UTC,That's actually the part that made me give up any remaining liking for the movie 😔
disney,3dzzem,lucyintheskywdemons,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:19:55 2015 UTC,"i have to say i wasn't a big fan of lava. i really enjoy pixar shorts, and this one let me down. i like that all/most shorts use no words and are usually funny. i got tired of the song right away and was disappointed that it was just a touchy/feely film. it wasn't a bad short, just not what i expected."
disney,3dzzem,wolfguardian72,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:56:30 2015 UTC,"Bing Bong is one of my favorites. Joy as well. I feel like I could connect with her the most mainly because I'm always happy. (Except when I'm at work, then I get Anger. lol)  But my favorite part was the ""shortcut"" that changed the dimensions of the characters."
disney,3dzzem,Xator_Nova,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:16:58 2015 UTC,"I loved it!  There was a certain shot where some sort of Disneyland Castle was being demolished, and I believe that this particular imagery encapsulates the film as a whole - Since Riley is starting to grow up and become an adolescent, her entire worldview is beginning to change and crumble, leaving behind her childhood fantasies to become a more mature woman. That is what adolescence is about, at least from the perspective of the director, and the fact that it was presented through visual imagery is really cool (It is also my favorite metaphor in my favorite anime ""Revolutionary Girl Utena"" and sends exactly the same message in both works)."
disney,3dzzem,Travis100,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:07:44 2015 UTC,"Spoilers!! It was all amazing. My favorite part of the story, despite his sad it was, was Bing Bong's disappearance. Beautiful animation and score matched with such an emotional scene. And can we talk about this score? So much fun to listen to, and it's so simple yet brilliant. Rainbow Flyer is such an emotional song for me."
disney,3dzzem,sandrarsfernandes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:19 2015 UTC,I love it! Bing Bong is my favorite. He deserves its own movie.

Saw it at the drive in with a restless toddler who had already sat through Minions (meh) so unfortunately didn't get all the feels like I thought I would, but thought it was a beautiful film. I really loved the originality of the objectification of the subconscious. Also loved Anger. Great film."

disney,3dyqdh,greatfia,2,Tue Jul 21 04:09:50 2015 UTC,I love this so much. Marie is my favorite and if I ever have kids this is sooooo happening.
disney,3dyqdh,greatfia,2,Tue Jul 21 04:04:17 2015 UTC,"She's my favorite too, you can find her at the Magic Kingdom near the Flag pole starting around 10:30am on days when it's not raining. I hope her brothers Toulouse and Berlioz might show up in WDW someday possibly in the France Pavilion where she formally did meet and greets since they are currently found in Disneyland Paris and very recently in Tokyo Disneyland. I wish there was a Marie flair on this subreddit. I also hope their mother Duchess might become a new meet and greet character in the future. The kittens can't be complete without their mother. Especially Marie who really loves her mother. Hopefully by the time you have children, you might kindly ask a CM who works with the characters to surprise you're children for when she comes out."
disney,3dyqdh,greatfia,2,Tue Jul 21 04:09:08 2015 UTC,OMG YOU CAN MEET HER BROTHERS? Yet another reason I need to go to the Paris park. I met her this April while I was Disneybounding as her and she was so sweet and excited and took her time examining every detail of my outfit. She even noticed my nails were painted white and pink. I really wish I could meet the cast member in that suit and let them know how awesome they were and how much it meant and still means to me. I'm going back to WDW this October and I found a dress with Marie printed all over it. My boyfriend will be bounding as Thomas O'Mally and I can't wait to see her reaction to him.

disney,3dzrfe,Luimnigh,7,Tue Jul 21 14:44:08 2015 UTC,I hear Disney is planning on live-action remakes of a lot of their shorts. They're casting mice and ducks now.
disney,3dzrfe,Zombies_Grace,6,Mon Jul 20 22:11:22 2015 UTC,"While I'm all for this, why has Disney been announcing so many live-action remakes over the past few months? It seems like they should spread the announcements out over a few years instead of just getting another one every month or so."

disney,3dzrfe,woltdosnoy,7,Mon Jul 20 22:16:39 2015 UTC,"So now, off the top of my head, we have live-action reboots of Dumbo, Winnie the Pooh, Tinker Bell, Mulan, Beauty and the Beast, Sword in the Stone, Aladdin.  Anyone want to make predictions for the next one? I'm gonna say Snow White since they already got Cindy and Aurora. Either that or The Little Mermaid."
disney,3dzrfe,fontizmo,3,Tue Jul 21 01:24:30 2015 UTC,"So far I've been fine about all the remakes, but I think I would actually be upset about The Little Mermaid.

disney,3dzrfe,brb1006,2,Tue Jul 21 02:50:37 2015 UTC,I'm going to bet the remake is an origin story about Ursula and how she became a sea witch.

Because it was testing bringing back the old style of animated films, Tiana is the first/only black princess, and it had it's share of controversy.   On a side note about Saving Mr. banks, I loved the movie, but I hated how they changed P. L. Travers's reaction to the end result of Her book. It seemed to Disney-fy her whole relationship with Walt and her decisions regarding production."
disney,3e0o1b,Geeky_reader,4,Tue Jul 21 01:58:43 2015 UTC,"It seemed to Disney-fy her whole relationship with Walt and her decisions regarding production.   They ""plussed"" it.  I agree.

disney,3e0o1b,sploich,4,Tue Jul 21 06:54:06 2015 UTC,"It'd be a biopic, so she probably wouldn't play herself. Actually, now that you mention it, the perfect person for the role is Viola Davis."

I've never seen Sting's wife's documentary on the making of the movie, but from what I've heard the production process was brutal and a lot of feelings were hurt in the process.

disney,3e0gc8,rninnj,6,Tue Jul 21 00:25:46 2015 UTC,The detail on Main Street has to be my favorite. From the smells (fresh baked cookie smell being pumped onto the street) to the sounds (the dance studio and barber shop) to the names on the windows (M. T. Lott Real Estate) - it's all too perfectly thought out... no detail left undone.
disney,3e0gc8,monsterbucket,2,Tue Jul 21 01:39:29 2015 UTC,"The windows represent someone in Walt's life that had impacted him in some way. Both him and his brother, Roy, have windows on Main Street. Main street was also modeled after Marceline, Missouri (I think was the state..) in which Walt and Roy spent most of their lives. You know when you are sitting between Uptown Jewelers and the glass shop on the right side of Main Street in MK? The piano music? Thats a teacher trying to teach a young child how to play."

disney,3e0gc8,xtonithetigerx,11,Tue Jul 21 00:47:37 2015 UTC,"One of my favorites is so hidden you can only see it at certain times of day. Many lamp posts along Main Street (I've seen them in Disneyland, but I'm sure they're in other parks, too) have three arms with baskets of flowers hanging from them. And when the sun hits them just right, the shadow of the hanging baskets looks like a hidden Mickey."

There are DVC families that own there that I have know my entire life so its really cool to come back and recognize familiar faces.   It also has a ton of cool activities we always go kayaking and the dolphins will just swim up to you. They also have pool parties and barbecues and fourth of July every tuesday. They have awesome bon fires as well. They have these activties at the other resorts but they guests are just a lot more social at HHI.   There are also hammocks everywhere to chill in. I also love that there is the resort and the beach house because the resort is on its own private island nestled in trees to its a much cooler temperature. Its really fun to explore the little island with your bikes or just walk around it. Then you have the beach house as well so you can go hang out at the beach and there is a fun pool at the beach house as well.   Also its the only Disney Resort with its own resort Dog Shadow, who is a golden retriever."

You can click through everything and get an idea of the cost ( it will be very different later )  If you want to expedite and speak to a representative to get the process going just call 321 - 939 - 4610. You will leave your information, estimated guest count, email etc. and someone will email you the initial documents."

disney,3dutk8,Popcycle-guzzler,9,Sun Jul 19 21:17:35 2015 UTC,I paid 5K in 2010 for my Disney wedding for 30 people. How crazy has the price gotten since then? Thats not including dinner and dessert party we had. We ended up spending around 10k total.
disney,3dutk8,BroBell,12,Sun Jul 19 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"I am having 60-65 Guests.  I am having a Saturday, Evening Ceremony in June so its 175.00 per person.  I am also obligated to spend 10k in enhancements.  I will be in bed with them for about 25k contract wise.  This is not including how crazy we want to get with other enhancements, rehearsal dinner, hotel we pick and other bells and whistles."
disney,3dutk8,mynamehere0820,2,Sun Jul 19 20:35:39 2015 UTC,"As a travel agent (and one who specializes in The Mouse), I'd suggest looking into a travel agent to help book your guests.  While Fairytale Weddings does an AMAZING job at coordinating the wedding aspect of things, a travel agent could help make your guests' bookings much easier, and provide very personalized service."
disney,3dutk8,Brentolies,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:36:24 2015 UTC,"Wow. one thing I regret doing was not buying the bus the bring our guests from the Poly to Epcot for the dessert party. I had instead arranged for cabs to be waiting outside to drive everyone to Epcot and gave each person a $20 bill to pay the fare. The cab drivers were AWFUL. Some people never made it to the dessert party because the cabs drove them around to bump up the fare. Half got dropped off at the boardwalk the other half got taken to the front gate of Epcot. Some were charged $10 others got charged $40. It was a total nightmare. But thats the only thing I would have splurged for if I could do it all over again, everything else was perfectly smooth!"

disney,3dutk8,GameFuelJunkie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:41:54 2015 UTC,"You can! Where you can get married depends on the number of people attending and what is going on at that particular time. For example, you can't get married in Mexico or Norway because of the Princess breakfast at Akershus. I know there is a reception you can do in Festival of the Lion King, but I don't know about the wedding itself. There is a way to get married in the Magic Kingdom, but the times they let you are very very specific. Specific days only and it's really early in the morning."

disney,3dutk8,ang17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:25:23 2015 UTC,"Well. Disney will send you their own save the date thing which they create that lists your three hotels and the rates, the number to call to reserve within the room block,  and mentions the discounted tickets and gives a number to call for that as well. It's a very cute thing, just not very personalized. I could send you mine if you want but I'm sure they'll send it to you soon. Because it wasn't very personal, my fiancé and I also sent out a letter with some more details about our wedding as well as magnets that my fiancé designed himself to look like old fastpasses. The letter is more detailed and the magnets serve as a little reminder that people can see every day on their fridge or something. So all in all we had a letter, the magnets, and the save the date from Disney."
disney,3dutk8,ang17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:33:53 2015 UTC,"Oh nice. Haven't received that yet.  I'm sure I will soon, we want to get those out asap so people can start reserving room blocks."

disney,3e1oi6,web_head91,2,Tue Jul 21 07:22:59 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched the documentary but I would wager that most groundbreaking entreprenuers like Walt aren't the easiest people to work with. And every one's got a story about an asshole boss.... I'm sure I'm the asshole boss in a few peoples stories.  I try not to look too deeply at Walt as a man, people tend to disappoint if you look close enough. Having said that I'm happy that he existed and contributed what he did to the world."
disney,3e1oi6,sillykittenpoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:04:41 2015 UTC,"There were two things in the documentary that stood out to me as exceptionally despicable. The first, that he couldn't even draw and signed works done by his animators to impress cameras and fans, essentially taking credit for things he didn't make.  The other was that during the production of Dumbo, a number of animators went on a strike that lasted several weeks. Later on, Walt worked with the FBI to get the organisers of the strike blacklisted from the industry, saying they were communists.   It's possible the former employees in the film have sour grapes, but they really all seem to have hated, really hated Walt."
disney,3e1oi6,sillykittenpoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:22:24 2015 UTC,OK I'm gonna go watch and google.
disney,3e1oi6,sillykittenpoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:38:04 2015 UTC,"Alright....   So there were some serious dick moves. Denying animators and directors awards and accolaids based on their work, not cool. I'm with you on that. He could draw though!   And I'm ok with him signing his name to pictures or cels that he didn't draw himself, it's his name over the door. It's Walt Disney Studios. I'm not sure if they mentioned him in the doc but Ub Iwerks might as well have been Disney's partner. He was pretty much the drawings man and Walt was the ideas guy.  As for the strike I can see why he took it so personally. He hand picked those animators, paid for their education and then paid them higher than any one else in the industry. Why didn't he want a union? His ego. He had been surrounded by yes men so long that the thought of some one telling him what to do was like red flag to a bull.   So that paired with paranoia led to naming people as communists to the House Committee with zero proof. Unbelieveably not cool. They have every right to be pissed off.   The values of the Disney brand are a stark contrast to his aparent corporate persona and if we held other founders of companies of the same era up to the same standard I think you would find them lacking also. Ultimately though I think his brilliance outweighed his short commings."

disney,3e1oi6,MeishkaD,2,Tue Jul 21 09:53:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's easy for many to forget that Walt was human and very much a product of the time in which he lived. He was in no way perfect, but he was brilliant. Sure he has plenty of detractors, but he also managed to inspire intense loyalty. It seems unfair to judge him by current standards rather than by those of his contemporaries.  It is sad that we lost him when we did. He was only 65, imagine had he lived another 20 years how he might of changed and grown. Picture what EPCOT could have become and meant to the world had he been there to guide it into becoming what he had imagined. How might be have used emerging technologies to push forward animation? Would be have been a force for social change? We will never know, but I supsect he would have been. Look at how both he and the Disney company changed their attitudes and policies regarding women and I think you can catch a glimmer of what might have been had he had more years."

I do want to add that I prefer Walt Disney World when we are talking about resorts and Disneyland Anaheim when we are talking about charm and cozyness. But TDS just blew me away. It feels like it was an incredible playground for the Imagineers when they were designing it.

But on the other hand, you can totally rely on the trains and subways and the destinations are also shown with English characters. If you can ride the subway in New York, you can ride the subway in Tokyo.  Tokyo Disneyland Resort is a short train ride from one of the central stations of the city."

You might consider enjoying the day by the pool and taking it easy then go to the park at 4. It's a good way to save using a regular park day pass.

I know when I've gone the lines to meet them were relatively short. For example, I got to meet Maleficent, Jafar, the hag from Snow White, and Dr Fecilier all in one night after the show. Be forewarned, you will leave with about 2 to 3 pounds of candy per person."

If you use toilet paper you don't even need to bring anything with you to the park, just stop off at the bathroom beforehand.  Definitely do a trial run at home first to make sure you can get enough height with the shoes she will be wearing though.  Good luck and let us know how it goes!"

disney,3dwb8c,bruinsra1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:07:22 2015 UTC,"To be honest, staying at a Disney hotel is worth paying the extra money just for the convenience of the transportation they offer. You can stay at a value resort around your max budget and depending on when you are booking, it might be a little less.   I looked briefly through the link you posted and many of these places you have to pay for the shuttle and/or it has scheduled times for pick up. Also, I don't think I have seen shuttles drop off at each park before so I'm not sure how that works for Good neighbor hotels."

They do have an additional resort fee, if you book through SAMs club/ Costco you might be able to get it waived. We booked through Costco and it waived the resort fee and included breakfast."

Some folk seem to hate both the old and new versions for not being properly themed to Tomorrowland, but, <shrug>, it's fun enough. I wouldn't tear it out unless something really E-Tickety replaces it. And it certainly won't be a Tomorrowland The Movie ride, that's for sure."

Disneyworld has better food. Disneyland is easy to do in 2 days. DisneyWorld you need at least 5. Splash Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean are better at Disneyland.  Watching night shows are way better at DisneyWorld (stadium seating for fantasmic!)  There are many more points, but I love both!"

Even throwing out Hollywood Studio, which is in my opinion the weakest Disney Park, I don't think California adventure beats Epcot and Animal Kingdom.  I guess it depends on how long your trip is.

disney,3dmjv0,glitzyjan,13,Fri Jul 17 14:12:05 2015 UTC,I feel so bad for my manager. She went to Disneyland for the first time this week with her husband and two young daughters...not the best week I see...

disney,3dmjv0,glitzyjan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:53:28 2015 UTC,"It actually wasn't bad this week apart from Friday. I went on Monday and Thursday. Typical summer crowds, but nothing as insane as I thought it would be."

disney,3dmjv0,redeyedone,14,Fri Jul 17 18:24:52 2015 UTC,Was the 50th this crazy? It seems like that would be the bigger celebration. I wonder if MK will be like this on Oct 1 2021. I guess DL has way more locals willing to make it for the special occasion.
disney,3dmjv0,tdt0005,8,Fri Jul 17 14:22:15 2015 UTC,MK gets like that for the 24 hour event alone.  It's crazy at times.
disney,3dmjv0,glitzyjan,9,Fri Jul 17 15:09:55 2015 UTC,Not at 6:45 AM it doesn't.
disney,3dmjv0,tdt0005,4,Fri Jul 17 15:17:05 2015 UTC,"My point is that it gets crazy for non-anniversaries so I have no doubt it will be just as bad at MK.  Your comment of ""more locals willing to make it for the special occasion"" doesn't really have anything to back it up.  People come out in droves at MK and I've no doubt they will in 2021."
disney,3dmjv0,glitzyjan,7,Fri Jul 17 15:19:10 2015 UTC,"Disneyland having a much higher percentages of guests be AP holders/locals/repeat customers is just a fact. There are way more people in LA and the surrounding areas than in Orlando. Most WDW guests are first timers who are not scheduling a special trip to be there on the day the park opened. There are far fewer APs and locals to account for something like this.   Also, WDWs 50th is during what is normally a relatively non-crowded season. DLs 50th is during the summer when a lot of locals are off or taking off anyway. So while I have no doubt the park will be very busy that day, I doubt it will be anything compared to today. Especially if WDW continues it's track record of not making as big a deal out of anniversaries as DL does."

disney,3dmjv0,nicklikesstuff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:46:33 2015 UTC,"The 50th was about like this as I recall. But because they were selling event-specific items, the lines didn't feel loaded until about noon.   The way they ran the lines into the park was impressive. Free ears at the door. Free cupcakes all day long. As we entered, CMs applauded while we walked down Main Street, as if we were on parade. Fun but crowded day."
disney,3dmjv0,Duhliterate,14,Sat Jul 18 03:17:23 2015 UTC,"Great photo! We got in the park at about 7:55 this morning, and while it was definitely the most crowded I've ever seen it, it was a lot less crazy than this photo shows. I guess a lot of people had already filtered through Main Street further into the park by then. Though it was crowded, we had plenty of room to move around on and through Main Street.   There were long lines at the Starbucks, but I was delighted to see that the similar line at the Carnation Cafe wasn't for food, but to get a photo with Oscar Martinez who's been working in the park for 55 years (which is wonderful, and pretty amazing).  We saw the birthday dedication speech, got to watch Richard Sherman (!) play ""Feed the Birds"" live on a small stage in front of the Castle, rode a bunch of rides, and had a great morning. Honestly, the crowds were less a problem than the heat -- it's a hot one today.  Anyway, it's a huge privilege just to be here today (my 11-year-old son starting planning this trip almost 3 years ago) and the staff and crew have been beyond amazing. I started out a real Disney cynic, but my family's love for the Park slowly won me over, and it's been an amazing day. I'd say even first-time visitors could easily have a tremendously fun time here today, and for the longer-standing fans it's basically a dream come true. Several dreams :D  YMMV, of course. One of the big lessons I finally managed to learn about Disneyland is that your experience really is what you make it to be."
disney,3dmjv0,AlwaysSayHi,3,Fri Jul 17 23:13:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the follow up info, I was thinking about going later on in the evening, was it crowded when you left?"
disney,3dmjv0,looneylovegoood,3,Sat Jul 18 00:07:48 2015 UTC,"We just came back in, it's crowded but a couple different cast members said they're not  close to capacity (one laughed out loud when we asked). It could get a lot more crowded, but so far it's ok. A lot of people are already camping out for 8:50 parade spots though it's only 6:15 now.   Unrelated note: just got to chat for a sec with a woman who was here in 1955 (though not on opening day). She said it's very different but feels very much the same. So cool!"
disney,3dmjv0,AlwaysSayHi,2,Sat Jul 18 01:17:30 2015 UTC,"That's good news! And thanks for the info! My sister and I saw the parade earlier this week and people camp out around 4 it's insane. But, it's an amazing parade though."

disney,3dmjv0,brb1006,2,Fri Jul 17 15:30:07 2015 UTC,"i went to the 50th, and they didn't let us into the park in a huge crowd like this til opening.  but we were waitin around outside the park like this. maybe these are just the first-in-line folks waiting, and they let them into main street before the rest of the park was ready. The 50th was awesome! they gave us all golden ears and cupcakes as we waltzed through main street once it opened. but it got crazy later on, and the crowd lined up when we got there (round 5am) was already nuts outside the park. lot of people got turned away cuz it was too many people. people stayed the night before to try to get in. it was SO worth it though. Especially since we had AP's, we just wanted to be there, no need to run around and see and ride everything."
disney,3dmjv0,whole-hearted,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:20:53 2015 UTC,"AP holder for almost 15 years here...serious question: why was is ""SO worth it"" to be at the park on a day like this?  I know what it's like to be a fan, but I can't imagine that in a month anyone will give two squats if I said I was there on the exact 60th anniversary date. Even the free gifts aren't worth it to me. I mean seriously...staying the night just to get in?? Have people lost their minds?? Or their jobs??  Despite this comment sounding like a judgement, I promise you I'm just genuinely curious why some people take Disneyland/Disney events so seriously."
disney,3dmjv0,ledfrog,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:29:45 2015 UTC,"For me, it was kinda like showing a special kind of appreciation. I didn't stay the night, and i don't think i would have unless i thought it might be fun with a group of friends just for the silly experience of it. It also helps that I live in San Diego, close enough that I got there in time to get in.  I guess, because I felt, in a way, like Walt did something meaningful and honorable with Disneyland that's beyond 'entertainment', I felt I a sense of wanting to honor him and the place. I was a teenager and took even the silliest things in life very seriously at the time. But there's something about Disneyland that uniquely honors the good in all people, and wants to show that and bring that out of you. So, I felt creating such a place was more than 'awesome', but was honorable. Kinda like going to church on Christmas. It's his birthday! It's a way of saying thanks."

disney,3dq8bl,FerralWombat,10,Sat Jul 18 11:34:34 2015 UTC,"There were Rapunzel and Tiana before Merida, too. And Mulan before them...And...  But I don't think the big progressive thing with Elsa is that she didn't need a prince. Or even, like Merida but not the others above, that she never had one. It's that she isn't a princess at all. She's a queen. Frozen is as much a story about her coming to power (magically and politically) as it is anything to do with Anna. Mostly, for me - and I've said this before, here - it's the cultural impact of seeing the story of a woman who, as a child is taught to repress and hide her power, learning to use and embrace it as an adult. This character and narrative is particularly powerful in our culture, where girls are taught to take up less room, make less noise, share credit, etc.   Plus music adds to the longevity and marketability of Disney movies/characters."
disney,3dq8bl,phantomrhiannon,4,Sat Jul 18 12:18:36 2015 UTC,"as a child is taught to repress and hide her power, learning to use and embrace it as an adult.   Ok, this part actually makes a lot of sense.   But you bring up Rapunzel and Mulan (sorry, still haven't seen Princess and the Frog). While, they were more empowered than many princesses before them, they still end up with a man in the end. So, while they accomplish a lot without one, they still end up with one. But Merida was first in outright saying she didn't want/need a prince and ends the movie without one.   I see your point in the part that I quoted though. That does seem to make a lot of headway.   Thanks!"
disney,3dq8bl,thesecondkira,2,Sat Jul 18 12:25:30 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be that annoying person, but The Princess and the Frog is much better than its box office suggests. And the villain is my 3rd favorite in all of Disney. See it for the villain, at least. Impeccably written and designed."
disney,3dq8bl,phantomrhiannon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:08:30 2015 UTC,"I agree:  ""Or even, like Merida but not the others above, that she never had one."""
disney,3dq8bl,Xator_Nova,6,Sat Jul 18 12:34:20 2015 UTC,"Elsa is ""progressive"" because her character arc does not depend on her being a woman to be interesting, while Merida does. You could genderbend Elsa completely, and you would get almost the exact same story (with the silly exception of Hans wanting to woo her, but that is not part of her personality and she is not even aware of it), which speaks volumes of equal representation of males and females in media.  This is merely an explanation, and not indicative on who the better or stronger character is."
disney,3dq8bl,YodaFan465,2,Sat Jul 18 14:03:44 2015 UTC,"Related to this, Elsa never even has the ""Should I have a prince?"" conversation that Merida does. It's not even an issue for her."
disney,3dq8bl,Zombies_Grace,2,Sat Jul 18 21:06:01 2015 UTC,Maybe because people have seen Frozen twenty times and Brave only once. :)
disney,3dq8bl,Limeth,2,Sun Jul 19 00:20:18 2015 UTC,"Because Merida is a terrible character. Her entire gig is that she's ""a princess who don't need no man"".  That's literally it. Being a woman is Merida's entire character. It's fake progressiveness. It's trying too hard.  Merida is also a spoiled, obnoxious, stubborn, conceited idiot. She isn't even the hero of her own story. Every conflict in the movie happens because of her selfish actions and she refuses to owe up for any of them and gets away with it at the end. She also has an enormous ego and she learns absolutely nothing because everyone else, from her mom to her brothers, have to bail her out when she messes up. She doesn't even do anything brave. Sure she stands up to her dad but once Mordu shows up, she falls to the ground screaming. No development made whatsoever.   Elsa, the topic of romance or her gender never comes up.  Her problems come from her powers and her inner mental turmoil. Her having deep flaws to overcome makes her much more progressive as a character.  Elsa is much more relatable and likable as a character. She makes mistakes and DOES owe up to them, feeling absolutely terrible about them. She is mature and collected on the outside yet absolutely terrified of herself on the inside. She has severe self esteem issues she needs to break through, and even as of Frozen Fever she still hasn't completely broken free of them. She's also a complete badass with ice powers who fights off and nearly kills two men who could have easily overpowered her otherwise.  It's honestly no surprise who people prefer. Merida is an example of it done wrong. Elsa is an example of it done right."

If the idea that was to be conveyed through the movie was love is compromise, then I'm totally lost.  I blame misdirection- I wonder what was Brenda Chapman's original vision for the story?"

disney,3dntd8,upyourjuicebox,-11,Sat Jul 18 02:45:01 2015 UTC,"Not if one of your parents is a brunette! Recessive hair colours, blonde & red, require one chromosome expressing the colour from each parent. Each parent carries chromosome in pairs. Queen Iduna, the mother of Queen Elsa & Princess Anna, is undoubtedly a brunette. That means one of her two chromosomes expresses dominant brown hair. Since blonde hair requires both chromosomes to be blonde, the mother's other chromosome must carry the blonde gene. An offspring with red hair requires a red-hair chromosome from each parent, something which Queen Iduna cannot provide."
disney,3dntd8,AnonnyMiss,4,Sat Jul 18 02:58:34 2015 UTC,"Okay, let's pretend for a second that hair color really is as simple as two genes (it's not). There are TWO gene pairs that directly control hair color:  b (blonde) and B (brown)  and  r (red) and R (not red)  Bb, Rr = brown hair, so two brunette parents of this combination can create:  bb, Rr or bb, RR = blonde  bb, rr = red.  Mmmkay?"
disney,3dntd8,QuantumKittydynamics,-8,Sat Jul 18 03:13:15 2015 UTC,"No. It's more like this:  Let B = Brown, b = Blonde, & r = Red  The mother has to have Bb, because she is a brunette & she produced a blonde daughter before Princess Anna.  Regardless of the father's chromosomes, Queen Iduna could never produce a child with red hair because she does not have a red hair chromosome to donate."
disney,3dntd8,AnonnyMiss,6,Sat Jul 18 03:22:06 2015 UTC,"I said two genes pairs. There are literally two pairs of genes. Come on man, do a cursory internet search."
disney,3dntd8,QuantumKittydynamics,-6,Sat Jul 18 03:39:00 2015 UTC,"That's not how hair colour genetics works. Queen Iduna cannot produce a redheaded offspring because she does not carry a red hair allele.  Princess Anna is not a redhead. She's blonde, officially strawberry blonde due to the slight copper tinge."
disney,3dntd8,AnonnyMiss,16,Sat Jul 18 03:53:02 2015 UTC,"Her sister has unexplained magical ice powers, and you're seriously worried about genetics? Couldn't the platinum blonde be an outwards manifestation of her ice powers? Or maybe, just maybe, genetics is more complicated than sketching out a Punnet square.  And just because you think she shouldn't be, doesn't mean Anna isn't a redhead. Let it go. ;)"
disney,3dntd8,QuantumKittydynamics,-13,Sat Jul 18 02:59:46 2015 UTC,"Snow Queen Elsa is a natural platinum blonde. If her light hair was a result of her ice powers, they would be white like when Princess Anna was stricken with a freezing heart. It's not despite being ""lightened up"" during ""Let it Go"".  Princess Anna shouldn't be a redhead- it does not match her personality, her family, her complexion, etc. She looks terrible & sales are suffering due to the aesthetic mistake."
disney,3dntd8,AnonnyMiss,13,Sat Jul 18 03:14:25 2015 UTC,"YOU think it doesn't match her personality and looks terrible. I think she looks completely adorable. Her hair reflects her pseudo-Norweigan background, and is a lovely complement to Ariel's impossibly-red hair and Merida's ultra-orange hair. Of the three, she's the most natural-looking of them all.  And please provide me with actual data reporting that sales have dropped appreciably due to Anna's hair color. Actual, quantifiable proof that the franchise is monetarily suffering because Anna is a redhead. If you can do that, I will happily eat my words, but frankly, this sounds more like your own personal bias leaking over into your perception of facts."
disney,3dntd8,QuantumKittydynamics,-17,Sat Jul 18 03:21:38 2015 UTC,"Princess Ariel's ketchup red hair makes her look like a clown, but she was part mermaid & she rocked the unconventional colour. Princess Merida has natural-looking red hair, unfortunately her film was a disappointment.  The most iconic feature of Scandinavians is blonde hair, particularly platinum blonde. Red hair is not uncommon there either, but little mermaid Danish Princess Ariel already rocked red-hair, blue-eyes, so such characteristics on Princess Anna is a knock-off."
disney,3dntd8,AnonnyMiss,6,Sat Jul 18 03:31:13 2015 UTC,"Good job, downvoting my post instead of providing data to back up your biased claims. Bravo. Applause That's an excellent way to immediately invalidate your opinions.  Continue to bitch and moan about something you will never change, Disney will continue to rake in the dough, and I will continue to adore the way she looks. If you want to have a civil discussion without breaking reddiquette, let me know, otherwise, your opinions really don't affect anything in any way so I don't particularly care. :)"
disney,3dntd8,QuantumKittydynamics,-14,Sat Jul 18 03:42:35 2015 UTC,"But Disney is suffering (well, not exactly suffering, but not doing as well as they could) due to their shortcomings with the character Princess Anna, not just her hair colour either. I've been observing sales trends on Amazon & typically the blonder Princess Anna, the more she sells. The only major exceptions to this rule is when certain items go on sale or the new ""Frozen Fever"" (new dress)."
disney,3dntd8,AnonnyMiss,3,Sat Jul 18 04:01:53 2015 UTC,"What if Elsa would have been brunette? Her ice powers made her hair lighter. However Anna, having lighter hair than a brunette... her hair went full-on white."
disney,3dntd8,thesecondkira,-4,Sat Jul 18 17:20:45 2015 UTC,Not likely. Having powers & suffering from a magical ailment can be very different.
disney,3dntd8,AnonnyMiss,4,Sat Jul 18 17:23:05 2015 UTC,"""Not likely""? You had me while you were using science, but there's no ground to stand on with that statement. Sure, you can make up some internal story logic, but it wouldn't trump my internal story logic that says they manifest in very similar ways."
disney,3dntd8,thesecondkira,-3,Sat Jul 18 17:32:16 2015 UTC,"I've gotten into this debate in other threads. I'm just tired of repeating myself.  Platinum blonde is iconic in Scandinavia- Queen Elsa is of Scandinavian descent. Her eyebrows & eyelashes are still brown, but so are many platinum blondes.  As far as Princess Anna having white hair from the frozen heart instead of platinum blonde, her hair colour is still rather dark. Two, her hair became very white, not just light blonde."
disney,3dntd8,AnonnyMiss,6,Sat Jul 18 17:49:53 2015 UTC,"Here's a family I know. Dad has brown hair. Mom has blonde.  The two girls are twins. One has blonde hair, the other has red. All of it's their natural colors and nobody's adopted.   If this doesn't convince you, I don't know what will."
disney,3dntd8,Obi-Tron_Kenobi,-5,Sat Jul 18 15:56:02 2015 UTC,"You got me there. Still, Princess Anna's hair colour looks very unnatural on her. Well, when it's redder.  Edit: Actually, no. I presume the older sons are standing behind the parents, & it seems that that their children (sans their redheaded daughter) were born with light hair that darkened with age. The mother is likely a born brunette with some great highlights. I'd say both parents were brunettes that carried a red haired gene."

disney,3dndim,jumptotherhythm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:59:52 2015 UTC,"I think my only issue with the theory is that the '10 years we've been rusting' lyric needs a very narrow interpretation for it to work.   You could interpret it as this theory does, or you could interpret it as they haven't had visitors in 10 years. The film doesn't explicitly say that they have been cursed the entire time, so it's all subject to interpretation.   We could further hypothesize that his parents are dead. And since 11 year olds don't have much interest in formal entertaining, his servants may have been bored long before he was transformed. I'm more inclined to support that theory since the imagery of the opening exposition doesn't support the theory that he was only 11."

disney,3dqv5e,ranoutofbacon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:11:30 2015 UTC,"I also didn't have high hopes for this movie. The first trailer I saw I immediately wrote it off as a movie I wouldn't go see, which surprised me because I'm always so excited for Pixar movies. But the second trailer I saw (the scene where they're in the kitchen and you see the mother's and father's inside voices) got me thinking that it would be fun.  I'm glad I went to see it. It's not my favorite one but Pixar did what they always do and bring realness into the movie. Do you see how Riley's personalities are all individual but the mother and father all look the same (hair or mustache) and are dominated by a different personality (mother has sadness, father has anger)? That's truly what is going on during child development. You're finding your identity. It looks like Joy would be her most dominant in the end but who knows! And having memories be the foundation of her personality- literally with the building of the different lands. Having physical representations for different facets of the mind, like TRAIN of thought, are why Pixar movies are so fun! They're creating tangible objects to abstract ideas.   I'll agree that Bing Bong annoys me but I see that they were going for a ridiculous imaginary creature and you have to admit, the self sacrifice thing in the end pulled at the heart strings. I cried, my inner child cried and in the end I enjoyed the movie."
disney,3dmqpq,crazypancakes,12,Fri Jul 17 15:06:52 2015 UTC,"I always felt it helped to break the narrative and differentiate between 'reality' and 'fantasy'  or to display altered perception in the movie's world.  In Lion King, ""I just can't wait to be King"" is Simba's desire for how he wants things to be, not necessarily how they are.  In ""Be Our Guest"", it's Lumiere wanting a return to when he could actually perform his duties and entertain guests.  Genie is showing off in ""Friend like me"" and ""Prince Ali"", but it's not 'real', and the animation subtly shows that.  There's the Backson song in ""Winnie the Pooh"".  It's a flight of fantasy where they are creating an imaginary creature to explain something they don't understand.  Or, ""Everything is Honey"" in the same film, which was basically a hallucination.   For more altered perception examples, see also Dumbo's ""Pink Elephants"" or Pooh's ""Heffalumps and Woozles""."

disney,3din9r,zieg0052,6,Thu Jul 16 16:03:19 2015 UTC,Is this from today? And is it safe to assume a smuggled selfie stick?
disney,3din9r,Canadian_chicken,4,Thu Jul 16 16:56:52 2015 UTC,From this morning at 9:00. I think it's back open now. They had to walk everyone down from the top of it.

disney,3din9r,PrestoMovie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:28:13 2015 UTC,hope they all got a free mickey ice cream bar  edit: used wrong words wrongly
disney,3din9r,bwr09,3,Thu Jul 16 19:15:08 2015 UTC,They get fastpasses because that's what's appropriate to the inconvenience they experienced.   They'd get ice cream if they dropped their ice cream bar.
disney,3din9r,CamperGirl,2,Fri Jul 17 14:27:18 2015 UTC,"i kind of figured as such.  got stuck in line for Splash Mountain @ WDW (back when they still issued paper Fastpasses) and when it looked like it wasn't going to reopen and they cleared the ride, we were issued ""any ride, any time"" passes."
disney,3dhq5u,FoodandWine2014,7,Thu Jul 16 10:57:27 2015 UTC,"The loss of Terra is really disappointing. I was looking forward to it, and am surprised that Disney would remove vegan/vegetarian options rather than add them."
disney,3dhq5u,newlyvegan,6,Thu Jul 16 12:23:28 2015 UTC,"I know! WDW used to be such a great place to go for vegans and vegetarians. I went down that list, and kept going, and going...literally a couple of vegetarian items and no vegan items (unless the coconut candy turns out to be vegan).   So many people from around the world are vegan, you'd think the Food & Wine folks would try to have at least a handful of options."
disney,3dhq5u,pbrooks19,2,Thu Jul 16 14:09:51 2015 UTC,"It was the first thing my wife noticed ... that Terra was gone.  The ""Crabcake"" was quite tasty last year.  Greece does have a Moussaka that includes a Gardein product."
disney,3dhq5u,0phie,3,Fri Jul 17 08:55:46 2015 UTC,Gah!!  Where is the Gratin de Crozets de Savoie - the gruyere and mushrooms dish from France?!  Since I won't be able to enjoy the alcohol this year I was really hoping this amazing deliciousness would be back. 😥

disney,3dhq5u,holymolym,3,Thu Jul 16 15:09:22 2015 UTC,"Has anyone has both regular haggis and the vegetarian haggis? Because I tried the vegetarian one and it was VILE. If that's what real haggis tastes like, I'm not missing anything."

disney,3dhq5u,QuantumKittydynamics,2,Thu Jul 16 16:26:45 2015 UTC,"I thought it was really, really salty. Like, the saltiness overpowered the flavor. I liked the stuff that came with it, but yeah..definitely unloaded the haggis itself onto my boyfriend.  But again, I've never had real haggis, so I'm not sure how true-to-flavor it was."

disney,3dhq5u,croquetica,7,Tue Jul 21 18:19:18 2015 UTC,We will be in Epcot during Food and Wine. Can anyone tell me how it works? Does it take place around the whole World Showcase and those different foods can be picked up in the different countries?
disney,3dhq5u,0phie,5,Thu Jul 16 13:29:59 2015 UTC,"There are little booths around and between all the countries. (This year there is one in Future World as well.) Each booth corresponds to that country/theme, so you can only buy what is there. You can also ask for a passport at one of the F&W shops to help you plan while you are there. Bring a pen to check off the things you have eaten/drank!"
disney,3dhq5u,what_an_ass,3,Thu Jul 16 13:44:27 2015 UTC,Oh cool so it's all grab and go food? What are the passports for?
disney,3dhq5u,Mafiachickens,3,Thu Jul 16 16:31:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, there's usually a small queue at each booth. you order what you want and then go to the window and pick up your food and drinks. Then the hunt is on to find a place to sit. You're probably going to be standing 90% of the time unless you go on a weekday.  The passports are just like a little log to check off what you have eaten in each country. The booths will also give you a unique stamp when you pay for your food, so that's fun too. They will not ask you for the passport, you will have to ask them. It's a nice memento to keep so you will remember what you ate. I like to star the foods and drinks that are really good so I can get them again the next year."
disney,3dhq5u,Dr_ChimRichalds,2,Thu Jul 16 16:57:24 2015 UTC,"Here's what my wife and I usually do with regard to ""seating"".  I agree.  You'll usually be standing most of the time, so we give up on that idea and while I'm standing in line for food, she tracks down a table for us to stand by.  That ""team concept"" usually works.  They usually have an ample supply standing-height, black metal tables spread out around World Showcase.  You might not be sitting, but at least you have a table to eat upon."
disney,3dhq5u,smoothlove69,2,Fri Jul 17 09:05:03 2015 UTC,"I forgot about those, but they are usually full too. My friends and I almost always just find a trash can and use the top of that."

disney,3dhq5u,0phie,5,Tue Jul 21 10:08:10 2015 UTC,You can use your magic band to charge to your room at each booth or you can also get a F&W debit card on a stretchy bracelet rather than having to carry around cash or constantly scan a credit or bank card.
disney,3dhq5u,NisforNightOwl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:16:38 2015 UTC,"The F&W debit card is a great idea if you take the time to keep track of your charge receipts on a regular basis.  I type all of our charges in Quicken to track things.  One day at Food & Wine can generate a lot of ""paperwork"" ... unless you put it onto one charge for a debit card."

disney,3dhq5u,0phie,3,Thu Jul 16 13:06:20 2015 UTC,"Haggis is delicious. If you've ever eaten scrapple (or hell, even a ballpark hot dog), there's nothing to be afraid of in haggis."

disney,3dg15i,sithoutcast,11,Wed Jul 15 23:57:00 2015 UTC,"This...makes no sense.   If the prequel is about the young street rat Aladdin before he meets the genie, then why is the prequel called ""Genies""?  If the prequel is about our genie and his supposedly larger previous master, why start writing a script for a prequel NOW, less than a year after Robin William's death? Disney knows how badly the non William's genies went.  The only thing I think it could possibly be about is how our genie grew up. We see him as a kid surrounded by a family of genies, in a genie town with a genie mayor, but something happens and he gets forced into a lifetime of servitude. That actually might be interesting..."

Relevant text from the article:   ...the script for the prequel, which will center on a genie trapped in Aladdin’s lamp."

disney,3dg15i,Stuartdjspence,5,Thu Jul 16 06:46:18 2015 UTC,How exactly is this being done without Robin Williams?
disney,3dg15i,ThereIsNoSantaClaus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:19:17 2015 UTC,"I see this a lot, but people forget to give Dan Castallaneta credit for the weight he's carried as Genie, too. Don't get me wrong, Robin Williams is the  original Genie (OG!) and without him we wouldn't have the character we know and love. But even before he passed away, Dan had already cemented a place as the Genie as well."
disney,3dg15i,xfkirsten,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:48:06 2015 UTC,The same way the Broadway show and the Disneyland show can be done without Robin Williams.
disney,3dg15i,OrangeFeels,3,Thu Jul 16 19:46:46 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who's tired of these live action remakes?
disney,3dg15i,eeelisabeth,2,Thu Jul 16 13:40:29 2015 UTC,"No. Definitely not the only one. I too am not a fan. Seems like Disney sees these remakes as a cash cow to be milked and that's what they're doing. They add very little to the lore. And in the case of Maleficent, they totally reversed the character's essence. No thanks."
disney,3dg15i,wilm_de,4,Thu Jul 16 14:37:55 2015 UTC,Jesus. Why? This is completely unnecessary.
disney,3dg15i,DukeMaximum,3,Thu Jul 16 14:31:42 2015 UTC,I just squealed. You guys.... I have been waiting for an Aladdin Prequel for so long. I'm such a big fan of the movie. <3

disney,3dg15i,yukifan01,2,Thu Jul 16 01:45:12 2015 UTC,I really wanted a live action remake of Aladdin ...not a prequel 😑
disney,3dg15i,ARTNK,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:50:57 2015 UTC,Me too :( Maybe if this is super successful they'll make one?
disney,3dg15i,pinkmermaid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:58:38 2015 UTC,"Hopefully , I just want to see a real life Aladdin 😍"
disney,3dg15i,ARTNK,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:29:35 2015 UTC,I feel you. But there's always the Broadway show!
disney,3dg15i,pinkmermaid,2,Fri Jul 17 20:32:53 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't this mean no Genie or Jasmine? At least, with regard to their relationship with Aladdin. I'll definitely watch the prequel but I'd love a live action of the original animated film as well :)"

disney,3dg15i,Obi-Tron_Kenobi,2,Thu Jul 16 07:03:03 2015 UTC,Oo!!! Awesome! Didn't read the article (page wouldn't load at work). :)

disney,3diucz,croquetica,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:57:03 2015 UTC,Ok. Thanks for the info! Will definately check it out
disney,3diucz,monsterbucket,2,Thu Jul 16 19:58:18 2015 UTC,"Ya its funny the first time when you see the ""remote control"" car and its cool when you see the cars interior and stuff. But after seeing it a couple times the only thing thats interesting is the stunts. I even found myself making fastpasses during part of the show last time lol."
