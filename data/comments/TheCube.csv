Giving each Youtuber (Straub, Grape, Stitch, Dylan, Dfield and Rusher) a colour is awesome as well. This way, much more people are involved - and we'll have to watch the other Youtuber's perspectives as well to know what's happening on the other servers.

I mean, I see where you are coming from because he seldom records with actual Cube members but he is still friends with them. If he left the SMP, we know why. It's not interesting to him anymore and his factions series is the focus of his channel. Why was Dul considered a Cube member when her last appearance in the Cube was during the Purge before she left (not including the UHCs)? What about Kermit and Huahwi? It seems these people are honorary members but Rusher is still involved in the Cube group."

It's just that his channel is at its peak with the factions series and he realizes this and is devoting all his effort into that, it's not wrong. He's respecting his audience.

He hasn't uploaded and SMP video in a while, but he still participate in clips and events in other members episodes. Rusher probably has left the SMP but not the group.

TheCube,3dn49f,DominusDragon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:47:14 2015 UTC,"A good idea, but I don't think it'll be done because, 1. Haters will call the Cube copiers, and 2. Next season is likely to be teams due to the pattern. However, I was thinking about this. What if it was chosen teams of 2, with the first other team you come across joining your team for the rest of the game. That would get around both issues listed above."
TheCube,3dn49f,EggCouncilCreeper,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:37:47 2015 UTC,Generally the credit for the UHC idea always goes to Mindcrack anyway. Haters have been calling the Cube copiers for that reason virtually since season 1.

Notable Cube members/Cube UHC members involved were Dfield, Grapeapplesauce, Pokediger1, Forstaken, Hyperdarkness and Talekio. The teams being Dfield,Grape ; Poke,Forstaken; Hyper,Talekio.  I think it would be archived so check out the respective twitch streams to watch their perspectives.   Spoiler: Dfield falls to his death and is the first death in the UHC. Then respectively Hyper, Talekio, Poke and Tofuu meet their death in combat. Grape was the last one out of the cube group and dies to SamAGaming - SamAGaming picks up Grape's Pow 4 bow and eventually shreds his opposition to win the UHC, so in essence - it was Grape's bow that did the trick ;) . (There were more people involved but I just gave a brief overview of the cube members involved)  Grape's stream ended with around 7k viewers (his viewers and Dfields' as Dfield hosted him after his death) which was an amazing feat, kudos! He was number 1 in Minecraft on Twitch for a while before he raided SamAGaming after his death.  Hopefully there'll be more of these in the future :) , looking forward to them."

I almost never talk with some of my best friends from school 'cause I have made new friends after. So the fact that people split/don't fit in with each other like they used to isn't that strange. For a fact it can happen overnight. And acting ""fake"" in like you enjoy spending time with people it freaking happens everywhere, especially in the business kind of world ;).  For me personally they are keeping to close to the ""formula"" which did get a bit boring to watch. Basically season 2 seems to much like season 1 to me, and I have a attention span of like 10 seconds so it doesn't fit my personality.  I've said it before and I'll say it again.

Mousie is out, slain by Aureylian. Bee says that it was expected, since Aureylian plays on mindcrack. Another cannon! LDShadowLady walked into fire whilst trying to escape Aureylian. 0,0 must be on fire!(heh).   Another cannon! Cleanup crew goes in as AshleyMariee slays Aureylian. Bee decides to go to 0,0 to fight too. Bee found a player! It's AshleyMariee. They fight! Ashley has her dog out! Bee got stuck in a block. She can't move, and Ashley takes advantage of this fact. Heyimbee was slain by AshleyMariee.  GG, Bee. Looking forward again for your POV in UHShe Season 2, if it ever happens."

Stacy plans her channel to the max and at this point a SMP isn't needed. She's building in Dogcraft (herself), creates the stories in bookcraft, survivals in Noobcraft, fights in UHShe (well let's hope there's gonna be some action :$) and playing with other people in her other series.  And let's be real, Stacy wasn't drama free herself on the cube as well. She got some really nasty comments on her videos (thinking about the Mooshroom incident, but pretty much on every video) and the stuff with Devon.... I think she is in a fine place now.  About the cube. Here is the problem of a SMP, it gets boring. I liked the idea of season 2 (the royal stuff), but in the end it's all the same. And to be honest the Cube wasn't a whole big family to start with. You always had groups and pretty much the only link between some people was Graser and actually it's more of a family of friends now that some people have left then it was before.  I do agree that there needs to be some action on the Cube tho. I feel (and maybe it's just a feeling) that everything is going really slow. Spawn is getting better but still not there and kind of allot of episodes are basically people doing nothing but walking and talking which isn't very amusing to me (I like stuff getting done).  With the events of late the discussion is most likely going to go on for a while and I hope when it's calmed down everything gets back on track. Working together everyday is not always fun and it's harder when you're younger. Not everyone's the same and not everyone is going to fit in. People change and the internet isn't going to agree with that. Life...  Edit:  Thanks for the awesome replies guys <3."

Someone below already explained that her series exploded, a few of these are Dogcraft, Bookcraft, Mineclash, and UHshe. There are more, but those are the ones that pops up. These series are great for her growth, and adding an SMP series like the Cube could slow it down.   Stacy is a wonderful YouTuber overall, she doesn't need a series to take a spot for one of her, dare I say, better and more creative series.

It would loose a lot of viewers because most of the viewers don't want to see that.  However, the fact that for two season, it has been getting rich on diamonds/gold blocks via shops is a little boring. So, maybe for season three in the far future, they could change the focus from shops to, I don't know, raiding or something. Please respond with some ideas <3 Love the Cube and all my fellow fans.

Just a side note, this would most likely be on the archon due to their size and players, and would be a full servers like the rest of them. Plus rusher is one of the biggest factions players on youtube. They could implement another factions server(similar to how they added platinum) Most of the cube members have done factions before so they know how it works. Plus the competitive edge of playing with other cube members would make it more intense and fun for the members. Add in the drama that is already in rushers show, this would make for an extremely entertaining series. On top of that, it doesnt have to be only current cube members. People like Creeperfarts and hyperdarkness can join in on the fun! All in all, we all know that Cube SMP is getting a little bit boring for the viewers and members. Factions adds a new style of play for the members and still gives the fun of interacting, having group events, and building!"

TheCube,3bv2yv,ToonSciron,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:30:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah that true, a fun faction server is where a lot of people are on. You can not just have a couple people on because then there would not be anyone to fight with."

TheCube,3bptcb,airbourne908,12,Wed Jul 1 04:27:41 2015 UTC,"For the people saying ""It's their living they have to make business decisions like this"", how is this at all going to effect their channel in a positive way? All they did was remove an innocent man from their recording group. Who does that benefit? Is it making them more money? No. These situations need to be handled more properly and, in all honesty, shouldn't need to exist at all. This is almost becoming attention seeking."
TheCube,3bptcb,HumanHashtag9,0,Wed Jul 1 17:31:03 2015 UTC,Lets all remember this is also minecraft
TheCube,3bptcb,Ollywolf,10,Thu Jul 2 15:11:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's wrong to continue to say, ""this is their livelihood etc.."" It is morally wrong to sacrifice being a friend or even sacrifice some sort of kindness towards a person for money. Turning a profit is insignificant when morality and treating others in a correct way is on the line. When it all boils down, M4M considered Graser and company as friends, and they had the audacity to throw that away for views and subscribers. And in the end, that is NOT ok."
TheCube,3bptcb,Lexhightower,9,Wed Jul 1 19:56:37 2015 UTC,"I kind of feel bad for the guy cause I too am a social introvert when it comes to talking and stuff. It takes a long time for me to get used to people and for the most part I usually like to listen and talk. I never really got to know M4M but he seemed like a nice guy when I was his team mate in UHC. I remember one time he was going to show me how to make a credit card system in Minecraft but it never happened. Maybe it was because I was too shy to remind him or he was too shy to remind me and when you have two shy people it sometimes doesn't work.     Anyways, I know that feel of lacking motivation on YouTube. When I was in college it was literally the worst for me because I couldn't post but I really wanted to. Since my time was too much into homework I had almost zero time to do anything and when I had time it was going into relaxing from the stresses of uni. I guess my advice for anyone trying to get back motivation is looking at the positive comments on your videos and how they make someone's day. The only reason why I am motivated to do anything on YouTube is because I read comments saying that I put a smile on someone's face.    I hope the best for M4M and I hope he finds motivation within himself to become dedicated because on YouTube that's the only way you can become dedicated. It's tough to find that dedication but once you find it the momentum will rise."
TheCube,3bptcb,JWingWangWong,7,Wed Jul 1 22:53:45 2015 UTC,"This is about the only genuine message I've seen about any of the situations revolving around the Cube. Thank you for putting in your two cents, you're one of the only ones I can believe anymore in this sense."
TheCube,3bptcb,HumanHashtag9,7,Wed Jul 1 23:01:35 2015 UTC,"Well.....Here we go  I obviously have mixed emotions about this, mostly sadness, since I may be the biggest M4M fan here. I've watched him for a long time, I subscribed to him when ""I banned You"" came out, over 3 years ago. I can understand why he was kicked, obviously if you're inactive it'll be hard not to. But this is one of those times where I wish mind reading or time travel was possible. So that graser could understand that his channel would maybe be revamped. But it's not, so he was kicked. When he said there were thoughts of him joining hermitcraft, I thought it wasn't right, he won't fit into that group. I do sincerely think he fits in with the cube. We know he does well with Tofuu and Poke. Is ""being funny"" really one of the only reasons why? Yes, I saw Dylan's message. Yes,  that does help us understand. But I really wish they would've given him a chance. I know this is unlikely but make him a ""test member"". I know it's a bad idea, but maybe it would work. If anyone deserves to join the cube it's Chris. He has tried so hard to get an smp that has worked. Vimcraft was his best smp, and that didn't even last that long. He seems like a great, nice guy. The type of a guy that would help you with stuff when on the server. The type of guy that may even go on PCS for a while. I think he deserves to join, even if it looks as if never will. He did say he may someday make videos again, but if not  We'll miss you Chris"
TheCube,3bptcb,brady11,6,Wed Jul 1 14:38:06 2015 UTC,"This made me sad, legitimately. I hope M4M has a good life, and I can't believe the message Graser sent him."

Obviously there is a lot of stuff that has been going on with the cube, lots of things that we will never know about, but it makes me sad how M4M felt after he was ""kicked"", and it makes me specially sad knowing that it seems as if he didn't have a chance to continue talking with his friends."

So they don't have to care about losing popularity to this. [They should be concerned about vanilla Minecraft SMPs becoming steadily less popular, but that's an entirely different topic].

Is that a fact or what you want to think to reconcile your narrative?  Ever think it's possible he could be saving up to get a place of his own? Or his parents are out of work and he's trying to help support them? Hell, he could even be paying rent to his parents to stay there. Point is, you really don't know about his personal life [he's made sure that's the case, in fact] so you can't really judge that.  Just because they're the only ones who tell their audiences about it doesn't mean M4M and Tomahawk are the only Cube members going through a rough patch. That's not to say it's not possible that Graser is just blowing his money, but none of us know and it's not our business to know."

You're guess is also less educated then mine, as, why would he be going around traveling a hell of a lot if he was focused on moving out/paying rent. Straub sacrificed that when he moved out on his own. Why would he go around in his videos talking about how he bought $300 headphones and saying ""I have no budget"" if he was really that poor? Honestly, it would blow my mind that he would be doing that and then claim to be struggling financially."

He made a valid point that many of his friends are in the smp while he was left in the dust."
TheCube,3bptcb,Buffalojoe00,3,Wed Jul 1 17:18:00 2015 UTC,"Bring on yet another flood of ""Cube is dead"" ""Graser is evil"" ""Cube members are money-hungry"" topics. Not completely unwarranted, I might add.   I mean, it was a clear mistake, but Graser and the other Cube members really need to start learning how to properly handle firing people from the group. This one in particular certainly seems to be more bad timing, but after dozens of instances of proof of how terribly Graser handles these types of situations [especially in the past couple weeks], I think it needs to be addressed and fixed."
TheCube,3bptcb,TheDemonicEmperor,2,Wed Jul 1 16:49:35 2015 UTC,"The fact graser didn't even call him. He just tells him via email is pretty rude and overall, I would've felt the same way M4M is too. That's just disgusting."

TheCube,3bptcb,FredTheWizard,-4,Wed Jul 1 12:08:41 2015 UTC,"I am here to defend the Cube and Graser on this one. I was there when the decision was made to kick Minecraft4Meh from The Cube UHC and I whole heartedly supported the decision for these reasons.   A. We had attempted to contact him several times in regards to the UHC season being planned and he would never respond to group messages or make ANY attempt to try to get to know people in the group.  B. He had not uploaded on his channel at all since the previous season of UHC and before that his video uploads were few and far between. For all we knew he was another Huahwi who stopped uploading videos and never responded to messages.  C. Graser did not... and I repeat... DID NOT make Minecraft4Meh quit YouTube. This angers me that people want to peg the problems that M4M was having with YouTube on Graser. If M4M wanted to continue doing YouTube he would have continued uploading content to his channel or made an attempt to reach out to people letting them know what was going on.  Sorry for the heated post, but getting really sick of people trying to throw all this shade at the Cube people when they don't even know what happens behind the scenes most of the time and instead look to make other people look like villains when they aren't."
TheCube,3bptcb,8bithomo,17,Wed Jul 1 04:40:41 2015 UTC,"You make very unclear and unreliable points. Why does Chris have to get to know you guys? Why can't you possibly try to go the extra mile and get to know him. Its very clear that he is a shy man and probably felt awkward and didn't know exact what to do. You're whole ""Huahwi"" analogy also ticked me off quite a bit. If you guys as a group are scared of another Huahwi incident, why did he get invited before people who were not showing signs of doing that and have been on the waiting list longer then him. Why would he get invited, hmm, maybe his rising growth of subscribers from when he disappeared into thin air the first time? Also, I hope YOU are not pegging Chris for pegging Grader, that's just his fans being butthurt. You make this very unclear. Yeah, he said it made him lose motivation, but wouldn't you as well if you were already losing motivation from Minecraft in general?"
TheCube,3bptcb,HumanHashtag9,18,Wed Jul 1 05:50:10 2015 UTC,"He didn't 'peg' graser for the problems on his channel - he stated he lost interest (and motivation) after his denial into that next particular UHC season. He wanted to make videos but he just didn't see the point, especially after loosing out on a huge opportunity such as UHC. As someone who knows introverts, that's how they act - put a detour in the way of a potential social endeavour and well that's the end of the trip. I find it a bit ignorant of you to assume that as viewers we would look at this and say 'graser made m4m quit youtube' when we know that m4m quit himself, he clearly says it. He never blames graser, just points out why he quit, which THEN brings the topic of graser into the fold as it was part of the reason.  Now as for the shade, I really wouldn't call it that. Whether people like someone or not, they have the right to comment on that, voice their opinions and KNOW what's happening. On the cube, this is an exception, apparently that's being a 'hater' or 'throwing shade'. I hesitate to say ""welcome to the internet"", but it's sadly relevant (and if you don't agree look at how this sub's rules are set up, or how comments get deleted if ""they're not relevant"" or ""don't abide by the rules""). Now with the amount of people that have come out of the cube and said something against it, I think it's perfectly fair to call out some of the negatives in these situations. The issue is that a lot of the negatives are not minor but are rather worrisome. Understanding that the cube is a business is fine and necessary - but acting insensitively, being a dick, or acting in a way that makes it seem like perceived popularity is a be all and end all is another story (Think, Kricken). And you may chalk those stories up to blips in the radar, anomalies with people's actions or personality, etc. But at this point, there have been TOO MANY of those issues, and very common ones at that - and people are starting to notice. We're starting to see these common threads emerging and whether they're true or not is one thing but the sheer amount of them is one thing but a correlation is another and it's definitely there (and that's coming from someone who used to a huge graser fan). As one who's been watching for a while and has seen these events unfold, you cannot continue to suppress these issues in hopes of them just disappearing. It is the internet after all, and there will remain a record of what people say or do (or don't do in some cases). Something else, we need to stop calling people who mention and discuss these issues as 'shade throwers' or 'haters' when they are simply viewers who want to talk about things that are merely happening. I've lost a lot of respect in recent weeks, but hey if you know something that we're all missing - I'm all ears. Of course I don't want to loose some of my favourite minecraft series', but I don't want to be disappointed again, or worse I don't want another content creator to be and for that to happen something needs to change."
TheCube,3bptcb,triskelions,-10,Wed Jul 1 08:07:10 2015 UTC,"I believe /u/8bithomo refers to the community pegging it on Graser, not M4M. And please, check the comment section on the video in question, those are the kind of viewers he is adressing with his post.  As for the rules on this subreddit, they are written to promote healthy, positive and constructive discussion about the Cube. We are constantly struggling with where the line goes to remove posts or not. Our meaning is never to censor opinions, as has been phrased earlier. The subreddit was created by the Cube members with the intention to get viewers' input and suggestions for the SMP, UHC and EVO. Somehow this has evolved into a place where spreading gossip and drama is the main attraction. In the meantime we receive complaints that the Cube members don't visit or interact with the subreddit as often as they used to, why do you think that is?  You have to realize YouTubers are people too, however cliche that sounds. I sure as heck would not like to wake up every morning to hateful messages such as ""I JUST WANT TO RIP HIS UGLY HEAD OFF!!!"" that I spotted in the comment section of said video, and just being told ""welcome to the internet"". That's making hate and bullying okay.  If you want to ""call someone out"" I recommend choosing another platform, because that's not what this subreddit is about."
TheCube,3bptcb,HumanHashtag9,3,Wed Jul 1 06:38:47 2015 UTC,"If they wanted to be treated like humans, why don't they as a whole stop trying to be perfect and admit to their mistakes flat out. Humanly, they're going to make mistakes. I understand that, but hiding the mistakes and let it spread like wild fire to our imaginations isn't smart and doesn't earn them any brownie points with fans. If they just told us their side of the story, without cover-ups for any wrongs they've done, I'll give their side a chance. But the way they have responded with the ""we're a business"" bull crap makes them sound as if they're doing something harmless. How exactly are they improving financially from kicking Tomahawk or M4M. It just makes them seem like their hearts are stone. I, as many others, want real, genuine answers. And if what they've given us is ""genuine"" then I guess I'll have no reason to stick around."

TheCube,3bptcb,Lexhightower,9,Thu Jul 2 00:17:48 2015 UTC,"Good to here from someone on the other side. I thought that his inactivity was the reason he was kicked and I'm sure Graser and everyone involved didn't know that he was just then trying to get back into YouTube. Though it wouldn't hurt for you guys to try to get to know him rather than him (being an introvert) having to get to know all of you, though he did know Grape, Poke, Joe, and I think a couple others. He seems to really want to get motivated to do YouTube again and maybe inviting him to a mini game here or there wouldn't hurt to make a new friend."
TheCube,3bptcb,Ninjarina24,2,Wed Jul 1 15:17:10 2015 UTC,"To be completely honest, you're right. The reasons behind kicking M4M from the UHC could be considered logically. However, i disagree with your ""throwing shade"" allegation. If a cube member would just come forward and lay everything on the table, everything that happened, even if it includes a mistake they made, then we wouldn't have to assume things. We're just forming a conclusion from the information that was provided to us. It's not really our fault that we have to ""throw shade"" at members. Because when information comes out in bits and pieces rather than the entire truth, misunderstandings happen. It's not our fault that we blamed Graser for this, because with the broken truth that was given, Graser looked like the one that was ""throwing shade."" Im not trying to be rude, trust me that's the last thing I want, all we want is the whole truth (when situations like this occur) so we can form logical and morally correct conclusions rather than seemingly ""throwing shade."""

There is barely any variety with who works on these projects. Graser is involved with EVERY SINGLE ONE. I feel stuff could get done a lot quicker if people had stuff to do. I wonder why Tomahawk felt like there was nothing for him to do and why he felt excluded. I wonder why people like Pat and Jwong can go so long between posting episodes because what are they gonna do? The Cube needs to do a better job of including  people.

TheCube,3bkb26,Buffalojoe00,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:04:08 2015 UTC,"I'd say teams generally are more fun. But sometimes they can have even more awkward commentary and dead air than usual if the teams are made up of players who don't normally talk with each other. [I seem to remember Straub and Kermit having awkward commentary in season 12, iirc]  I also like it when people with vastly different strategies in UHC are paired trying to adapt to each other's playing style [my favorite was watching Stacy, who generally avoids any fighting, trying to work with Tofuu, who's normally the one getting into all the fights]"

This is why a lot of YouTubers have a separate general gaming channel. The Cube members like playing other games on stream, but a lot of people complain if they do and start asking for Minecraft as soon as they switch. So if they also started doing CS:GO videos, people might complain saying ""you've changed too much"", ""you post too much of this game"", or ""just stick to Minecraft""."

TheCube,3bex8w,Captain_Reality,7,Sun Jun 28 16:35:24 2015 UTC,yeah cutclean was good for a dragonrush as it was going to take a while anyway but for a solo game cutclean isnt a good feature

TheCube,3bex8w,TheDemonicEmperor,2,Sun Jun 28 16:48:53 2015 UTC,"Call me old-fashioned, but I like seeing them work for their stuff in UHC. Part of the UHC process is time management and luck. Cutclean takes the luck out of UHC since important things like leather and feathers always drop as well so you don't waste as much time farming stuff for arrows and books. Without cutclean you also need to balance your time between smelting and mining and making sure you have enough coal to smelt what you need."
TheCube,3bex8w,brady11,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:30:50 2015 UTC,most people over at r/ultrahardcore hate cutclean   This is an understatement xD but I agree with you that cuticlean isn't bad but isn't right for a RR

TheCube,3bex8w,GaryAGalindo,0,Sun Jun 28 19:43:39 2015 UTC,"May I ask why it doesn't work? Yes, it's easier to get armor, weapons, etc causing the season to be shorter than usual, but does it really decrease the difficulty of finding the resources? Getting super OP really just depends on whether or not you find a good cave. People can still struggle through caves because of mobs, especially if they find a spawner or mineshaft. It is a little harder without cutclean because of smelting, but because of that very reason the season becomes a little boring for some viewers.  A lot of the episodes are spent not mining for resources, but just sitting there waiting for items to smelt. Most members go around looking for more things while it smelts, but if they come back with more resources then there's more waiting. In my opinion, cutclean just makes things more fast paced and provides more action. I'm not saying cutclean is superior to regular UHC (in fact, I'm really hoping next season isn't cutclean), but it just takes out the boring stuff and gets to the action."
TheCube,3bex8w,DarthyTMC,2,Sun Jun 28 17:29:00 2015 UTC,"I see what you are saying, but UHC is both a skill and luck based game. Its not really Ultra Hardcore if its easy to gather and amass resources. It takes away from the challenge of UHC if anything. Instead of blaming the game of UHC, why don't the players train better not only in game play but in commentary to make it better for the viewer? That's the issue with recorded rounds of UHC. They demand skill, luck, and entertainment of the viewer, so I see where cut clean makes sense, but I think it makes the game too easy."
TheCube,3bex8w,DarthyTMC,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:00:40 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I see why they would think about adding it but it ruins part of the UHC feel in my mind.
TheCube,3bex8w,thatoneguy73,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:36:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah it does since you have to beware of mbs sneaking up on you while smelting.  Or being stuck on in general.

Probably why I'm a good builder. =) <3  MrMitch- To be honest, I don't watch much of Mitch, but I know he's so kind and funny!  NoBoom- I can't even. When you were added, sparks flew and my mind was blown. I love you every minute I watch a Bridges! You tought me well.  Parker- I have no words. Parker is one of my favorite members since Stacy.

TheCube,3b8f6a,brady11,8,Fri Jun 26 21:00:47 2015 UTC,"Here's my compliments.  Bee- I'm sure Bee is going to make a great queen and it's so fun to see that she's the only girl on the Cube and she needs to represent!   Devon- I don't really watch much Devon, but I think his tree house is awesome, and I think him and his boyfriend are super cute together!  Dfield- I think Dfield is an awesome commentator, he always knows how to make me smile. He is a great Cube member and I can't imagine the Cube not having him in Season 2, he's had great contributions, with the castle, guardian farm, and more! Keep up the great work D!  Grape- Grape is a really creative guy. His base is super cool, and so are his ideas, like the Apple Store. He's also super awesome at PVP and in UHC.  G10- Where do I start on this one... Graser is such an oddball and his weirdness is great, although very strange sometimes, it's always fun to open my YouTube and see a new G video and wonder what craziness will be happening in this video.  H- I love how much work H puts into everything. He did a great job on Cubeversal Studios last season and this season he's doing great stuff too. He's a fun commentator because he knows a good mix of more serious and silly.  Huahwi- I do admit I've only watched one Huahwi video ever, but he seems like a really awesome dude. Great at PvP too! :D  JWong- JWong is a funny guy. His editing videos are hilarious, and I love how he died in UHC Season 11... legendary.  Kermit- Kermit is such a nice and caring guy. He's a great dad, and he puts so much work into the Cube, and his base.  Kiingtong- Will is one of my favorite Cube members. He's hilariously funny, even when he's not trying to be. And can I have his building skills? Also, he puts so much work into the Cube.  MrMitch- Mitch is another of my favorite Cube members. Just like Will, he's funny without even trying. I love his commentating,  and although he doesn't spend as much time on the Cube as others, he's super awesome.  NoBoom- NoBoom is hands down my favorite Cube member. I was ecstatic when he was added. He is a great commentator and PvPer and never fails to make me laugh. He puts so much effort into everything it's amazing.  Parker- Parker is hilarious, every second of every video. Every accent or impression, or anything he is just hysterical.  PatClone- Pat is one of, if not the most, sweetest person on the entire Cube. He is pretty inactive, but he is so caring and nice and yeah I love Pat.  Poke- Poke is another great guy, with lots of great ideas. He's super nice and a great great commentator.   Rusher- Rusher is a character. He's super funny, and unlike some people, he's super funny when he's mad. He has a voice like no other that can be identified easily. He puts lots of work into factions which is pretty cool too.  Straub- Straub puts so much work into the Cube, and will be doing more as president. He's another funny commentator and it's always fun to watch a Straub vid.   Tofuu- Tofuu puts so much work into his base it's crazy. He has so many great ideas and plans that I hope to see him carry out.  TYBZI- TYBZI is crazy funny, and always makes me laugh. He has the best reactions to everything."

TheCube,3b8f6a,TheDemonicEmperor,2,Sat Jun 27 00:42:38 2015 UTC,"I'll give some compliments:  Bee: It must be a bit hard for you being the only girl in the cube. But, you still seem to have a really good time. Congrats on the queen, and lets wait to see what you will show us in the future.  Devon: The magical flower sorcerer of the cube. You make everything fun, while adding some sassy entertainment. But remember, people will never be able to get the right amount of sass to copy you.   Dfield: The castle you made at the beginning looked amazing. You have been a great commentator, and even though you've been pranked a dozen times, you can live through it. Long live our definition of the letter d.   Grape: Grape, Grape, Grape. You are an amazing pvper, (I still want to see you face Huahwi) and even won yourself the latest uhc. You are a hard worker when needed, and have a noice laugh.  Graser: One of the first cube youtubers I watched. You always did your videos with positivity, and always make everyone around you happy too. You are funny to watch, and have the longest videos out there which keeps me not bored for a long time. Just rememeber to say scabadushka!  Hbomb: You're a great builder and pranked, even though some people don't see it. That end prank of yours was spectacular, and the ones done on these seasons are too. You have a way to have fun, while also putting up with Graser's shenanigans. You and Graser do make a good pair though. #Gbomb  Huahwi: Whaever you say, you're still Hawaii. An amazing paper, who has also shown to be good at pve in uhc. You fighting Grape would make a spectacular battle. I loved your videos, and hope you're okay on your break from youtube.  JWong: You are one of the lesser known cube members, but still one of the better ones. You're a great builder, and also creative. I really liked your fortune cookie shop. Remember the desert temple? :)  Maybe you could become the chef for the king or queen too? I think you would fit into that position.   Kermit: It must be hard for you to juggle between the cube and your family. Even with the constraints, you have been seen as one of the hard workers on the cube. You have impacted cube a lot, and own some of the biggest industries in the cube. I wish you good luck with your baby in the future!  KiingTong: You are hands down, thee best builder in the cube. Your builds are fantastic and rival all other builds. You could probably succeed a dropper map with under 10 deaths too. You are basically a jack of all trades in minecraft. Remember Kiani?  MrMich: A.K.A. the leaker.  A perfectionist at heart. You always make it so your builds don't have a bad spot in it, and make it look guild. You're also amazing at redstone. I would never be able to do an auto sorter like you.   NoBoom: One of the newest members of the cube. You have good charisma with all the members of the cube, and make very entertaining videos. I feel as you continue on with your series, you can make a big impact on the Cube. I hope there are more coming after you.   Parker: Liam!!!!! You are definitely one of the most funniest person in the cube. You always make your videos funny, while having some of the most entertaining ones. You are also an amazing builder, and a troller too. You are honestly such a great cube member, and I wish you would upload videos again. But if streaming makes you happy, you shouldn't stop doing it.  Pat: The dessert king who could also be part of the ice kingdom. You are able to work on a project with full effort, and still have time to do a collar with others at times. Your shops had a unique style to them, and I wish you continue on making these unique builds.  Poke: You have been in cube uhc since the very beginning with Graser and have been doing good in almost all seasons, while having your positive spin on them. I mean, just look at your mouth! You always look happy. You getting added to the cube with tofuu was great. You two have really hit it off there, and even by yourself, you can do a lot. I bet you can make the casino look really good with Graser.   Rusher: You have finally redeemed yourself by not dying from Dul this season. You are one of the most known members, and your collars with people are grape. Even if you haven't been on the cube after a long time, you get right back in. You continue on building your builds, and won't let any pranks on you bother the construction of your builds.  Straub: One of the master prancers, who have done great builds on the server. Instead of doing small builds, you make them worth awhile. All your projects are huge, and when they're finished look fantastic. When the millennium falcon gets finished, it will be an amazing sight to look at. Just try not to get eaten by Parker again.  Tofuu: An amazing ulcer, while also a good vanilla players. You know how to make everyone have fun, and a good friend to the cube members.  Your mini games you make are amazing. The creative power put into them is endless.  TYBZI: A fierce rival to parker for the funniest person on the cube. An amazing president, and a judge too. You make everyone laugh, and make the best out of everything. You are the person who makes the pranks given to you anti pranks. Also, you're a great builder. That giant cave spider was a great build."

TheCube,3b8f6a,Classic36,2,Sat Jun 27 03:33:04 2015 UTC,"Grape - you're one of the most chill members of the Cube and a really hard worker who up until recently managed to balance a full-time job along with Youtube. Hope you're finally getting the chance to relax a little.  Hbomb - a fellow Pokemon nerd, you always inspire me to go big or go home with all of your time-consuming huge builds.  Jwong - you always make me laugh with your one-liners and your edits  Kiingtong - One of the sweetest and funniest members. Spawn wouldn't be as great as it is without you.  MrMitch - Another absolutely hilarious member. You're always so funny [intentionally or not] and all the videos with your sister are absolutely adorable.  Tofuu - Great at UHC and you have all kinds of crazy contraptions that I love trying in my own single-player worlds.  Honorable mention to Stacy. I realize she's not on the Cube anymore, but if it weren't for her videos, I would have never found the rest of these lovely people.   Stacy - you always put so much effort into your videos and make sure there's a great story behind everything you do. <3"

TheCube,3b82yw,Gravitystar88,6,Fri Jun 26 18:52:20 2015 UTC,"Lemme explain:  So on Mineplex there was a user who changed his name to G4Y.  This was to show how he was proud of his sexuality in minecaft, however the word ""Gay"" on Mineplex is censored since most people used it in a derogotory manner.  So he was banned for ""Bypassing the Filter/Innapropriate IGN.  This didn't sit well with the community since many users including myself were outraged and made multiple posts expressing our opinions on the fact that G4Y was banned.  In /server Lobby-1 people were flamming at staff and on the Mineplex teamspeak hundreds of players changed their name to: ""Justice 4 G4Y"".  8Bitthomo was also outraged at this and made a few tweets saying how he should be banned as well and how disapointed he was in Mineplex in general.  The following day Chiss released a statement apologizing and unbanning G4Y everyone lived happily ever after.  He wasn't ACTUALLY banned but this is what happened.  (Simplified) and quick search in older posts on the Mineplex forums and you'll find a lot more."

The reddit is not a place to start rumours, especially as it is seen as an official source of news. The replies to the comment were also silly and not necessary.

That was a bad server that was not properly setup to efficiently host a uhc. They were attempting to do everything with command blocks on seemingly a 1 gb server.

TheCube,3au3sr,SaltyDogPlayz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:44:49 2015 UTC,I think the cube should make a casino like last season and could put all the chance/ gambling games ( pokes game and the ice breaker). Because the design of pokes one is okay. They could also bring back games from last season
TheCube,3au3sr,ToonSciron,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:29:01 2015 UTC,"Btw in Graser's latest episode he talked about making a huge street with different builds for different casino games, like a mini Las Vegas."

TheCube,3as6ms,LeafbladeMC,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:15:56 2015 UTC,"My school is named after the town, so something that had the Cube in the title could sound nice. My school had the bottom floor be hallways to classes, lockers, and the lunch room. The other two floors had other classrooms (the 2nd floor had the offices) and the gym was kind of seperate, but connected my a glass hallway, so maybe instead of putting the gym right on the first floor they could do a second building connected by a glass hallway (or just a hallway) and then put classrooms where the gym was going to be. I think a spiral staircase could be a nice touch."

TheCube,3ai2ox,ayyitswarlord_____,3,Sat Jun 20 11:27:50 2015 UTC,"no offence, but they would not ever use this. not to be mean but here are some reasons why:   The backround minecraft is default. you need shaders. 3-5 FPS for the backround is not good at all The words were ok, but they did not have shadows on them, or high quality movements. the letters and words need to fade in and out. that's standard. the player models (novaskin?) were OK but they also should have faded in and out. at one point your mouse is on the screen and goes to shut off the recording and makes this big recording software thing come up. it needs to move with the beat of the music. each team should get one bar of music time, (1-2-3-4) then it should switch to the next team and they get 4 beats (1 bar) as well!   i did like your use of custom skies. but combine that with shaders and a high FPS, and it would look awesome.    again i'm trying to give you advice, i'm not trying be mean or insult you.

Yeah the commentary might be a bit awkward for the first few episodes, but it could create some awesome new Cube ships. xD"

TheCube,3ai2ox,Brosephplayz___,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:15:43 2015 UTC,I don't like the teams I feel like random or have them choose I know im stressing random out so much its annoying but I mean who didn't like the mystery aspect of season 6 and the teams bayani and mr.mitch didn't even see that one coming I fell like it would be better and like awkardking states maybe their would be new people teamed with people they don't usually record with.

TheCube,3aexvw,VernonN,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:54:21 2015 UTC,HEY how about its teams of 3 or 4 and everyone gets randomized a colored firework a stack of them obvi. and you would have to find whos on your team by exploring and finding people and using the firework and if u have the same color then your on the same team and if not then u fight it provides mystery for both audience and players. I would love this or u can use wool and just wave it around I just want another randomized season so it can be balanced between the bad players and good players well not bad players.

TheCube,3aamuy,Ollywolf,5,Thu Jun 18 15:36:52 2015 UTC,I think it took way too much time and effort for something that doesn't have an actual use. The subway should've been finished long before the airport even existed.
TheCube,3aamuy,DarkraiTheAccuser,3,Thu Jun 18 16:25:49 2015 UTC,"Anyone else remember when Straub made the first redstone airplane in Season 1 and it failed horribly due to server lag issues? I really don't understand why the airport was even built, regardless if there are or aren't ""cool"" destinations to go to.  Overworld travel is just a problem for season 2, in general. The nether is a mess and it's not likely they'll implement a nether hub, the subway system never got the help it needed with Kermit, and now the implementation of an airport? Travel by horse is really the only option they have. The only reason I can see the airport being used in an episode is if Graser forces people to use it. Even now, it's only the reluctant spotlight of a tour around spawn. To say the least, I'm not a fan."

TheCube,3aaflc,babycactuslovesrose,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:10:47 2015 UTC,Ya it seems like a good idea... maybe they should have like an option where they can have mumble or no mumble because I feel like it would get kinda annoying or maybe they could have it for just events like someone else said

TheCube,3acb8s,waitisthisajoke,10,Thu Jun 18 23:05:55 2015 UTC,"So in a sense, Echoooo told Dul that he doesn't think she could take him on. People think he may have insulted her, but I don't think he meant it in a rude way.  It's a game and mild trash talking does happen. Never mind that in Dfield's season when he killed 12 people he constantly made comments that were very cocky and rude. ""Oh it's just jwong let's quickly take him out. (Insert snarky tone)"" Yet no one cared that Dfield messed up too and treated his teamates in the 3 team UHC rudely as well IMO.   Guys, like people have said before, not EVERY cube member likes each other, and people make mistakes. We shouldn't just gang up on a Cube member because I am sure many of YOU have said something offensive to a friend without meaning to or as a joke and it wasn't taken the way you had hoped. No one is perfect and we all make mistakes.  I don't know if Dul and Echoooo confronted each other about this and Echoooo apologized. We never will know but that problem is between them and if we as the subscribers are trying to moderate how all of them (grown adults and young adults) act and speak or gossip about this, we aren't being a constructive fanbase. The drama isn't within the Cube members and each other all this time. It's between the fandom and our unfair expectations of the Cube.  It's none of our business, I am tired, as many people are, of coming to this subreddit to see the scandal of the week, and they aren't perfect.   tl;dr  Don't stick your nose in others people's business and cause drama if you don't know the situation. We all make mistakes and aren't perfect."
TheCube,3acb8s,GaryAGalindo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:58:25 2015 UTC,"But Dfield and jwong are friends, Dul explained herself that she doesn't even know Echo and they aren't friends. So for him to do that was just so uncomfortable. I get that you all want to defend the cube members and say that 'its none of our business'  But the reality is, I watch these people, and if rude things are going on behind the scenes I DONT want to support them. Simple as that, I'm not going to stay a loyal fan to a group of people who tolerate rude attitudes."
TheCube,3acb8s,HumanHashtag9,2,Fri Jun 19 01:27:46 2015 UTC,"The thing is... This isn't the first time rude things have been brought out (even though I don't find this very rude.) So if you don't want to support that, I suggest you don't dig too deep into Cube history..."
TheCube,3acb8s,Big_Whiskers,2,Fri Jun 19 02:03:36 2015 UTC,"So based on a small comment that Dul CLEARLY laughed at and didn't seem to take to heart, despite her ""I don't even know you"" comment, you would just never support Echo?   Seems logical."
TheCube,3acb8s,Ninjarina24,2,Fri Jun 19 07:10:35 2015 UTC,I am sure Echo did not mean to be rude.  Look at your own life.  How many times have you said something that comes out the wrong way to which you intended it.  Its part of life.
TheCube,3acb8s,byayyallday,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:18:55 2015 UTC,"Here we have a classic case of intent vs impact. Echoooo's intent was to make a joke, create some commentary, process the UHC experience externally, etc. Your perceived impact is that Dul was offended by this commentary. I honestly believe offending her was not the intent of his comment. I do understand that you don't want to support hurtful people! I totally agree! But, that's simply not what happened here. Don't be quick to punish Echoooo. Remember, as much as we would like to believe it...we don't truly know the real Cube members, we merely know their online personas."

TheCube,3acb8s,MakersMind,4,Fri Jun 19 02:06:54 2015 UTC,This is what I hate most about certain cube members. It's clear that the lesser knowns get disrespected the most and it works on some weird elite-viewer system that just really irks me. At least Dul's away from that now. Absolute mess.
TheCube,3acb8s,The_Swarm_Hut,2,Thu Jun 18 23:58:47 2015 UTC,I'm confused? He was rude saying he thinks Dul couldn't kill him in UHC?
TheCube,3acb8s,grievingkidneys,-2,Fri Jun 19 00:06:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Like, he was just being confident and saying he thinks no one can beat him.  He happened to be talking about Dul, but he would've said the same thing to anyone. People get offended at the silliest stuff."
TheCube,3acb8s,grievingkidneys,4,Fri Jun 19 01:42:11 2015 UTC,"He meant nothing by it. It was light-hearted. Relax, everybody."
TheCube,3acb8s,DarthyTMC,2,Thu Jun 18 23:22:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he didn't mean it rudely at all.  It was light-hearted teasing.  He wasn't actually insulting and don't take it too seriously lol."
TheCube,3acb8s,byayyallday,-4,Thu Jun 18 23:33:14 2015 UTC,"He rudely said that Dul would never be able to kill him, everyone in unison goes ""woooahh......... Echo......."" No one saw it as a joke so I don't know what you are saying.  Dul was also offended by it if you listened to it.   And Graser also took it OUT of his video and basically changed Echo's comment to sound nice... So...."
TheCube,3acb8s,Brosephplayz___,4,Thu Jun 18 23:24:51 2015 UTC,"You can come at Echo's comment in a few different ways.   It could simply be a pride thing...harmless banter. When he says, ""Nah, probably not,"" it's just an offhand comment aimed at bragging and beefing up his PVP skills. Harmless, silly, simple.   Or, you can see him as disrespecting Dul as a player and part of the community. Unfortunately, this is the kind of comment 'girl gamers' get all the time. I'm used to it, I get this from my guy friends, my brother, PC community, Xbox community...whatever. It's a part of the gaming culture to assume girls don't have the same skills as guys. We all get it.  Honestly, I see it as the first option. Should he have been more careful with his words, yes...But, I don't think this slip up is worthy of hate from the community. It wasn't malicious. It was just quick, in the moment commentary. I think we should give him the benefit of the doubt and hope it doesn't happen again."
TheCube,3acb8s,Buffalojoe00,2,Fri Jun 19 00:47:04 2015 UTC,I feel like your making a nothing a big deal it was a rude thing to say and even tho dul doesn't know echo he is basically saying he could beat dul in a fight that's it. And you have to admit dul isn't the best at pvp just saying she did forget her chestplate and she only does have one kill in uhc history like I said before just saying
TheCube,3acb8s,Buffalojoe00,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:21:28 2015 UTC,What did echo say?

TheCube,3acb8s,Lexhightower,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:15:35 2015 UTC,I watched Grape's. I can't determine what he said. Please tell me.
TheCube,3acb8s,SaltyDogPlayz,0,Thu Jun 18 23:24:27 2015 UTC,I added it into the post
TheCube,3acb8s,SaltyDogPlayz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:30:24 2015 UTC,"I watched Grape's video and I think Echo was just joking around. He could have said it to anyone and it just so happened to be Dul. And if you listen, Dul laughs when she says ""I don't even know you."" So while it could be taken as a rude comment, I don't think he meant any harm when he said it, and I don't think Dul really took any offense to it."
TheCube,3acb8s,Big_Whiskers,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:41:49 2015 UTC,"I feel that it is obvious that Echo is joking. If you listen closely you can hear Dul say, ""ahh... I wish I would've found you."" Implying that she thinks it would have been easy to kill Echo. All he did was reply back with, what he thought was, equally harsh trash talk. You can also tell after it happened that Echo felt bad, but didn't want to continue to make everyone uncomfortable. He tries to move on and lighten the mood. I think Echo may have been unintentionally rude with something that was meant to be all in good fun. I don't believe it is necessary for him to address it. If Dul was truly affended, she should be able to contact Echo and privately discuss it with him. I also do not think it is necessary for followers to unsub and discontinue watching Echo. You cannot have unrealistic expectation for the youtubers you watch. You have to remember that these people are just like you; they slip and they make mistakes. It is up to us as followers to acknowledge that we saw them, ie do not defend unacceptable behavior, but remind them that we care for them and are willing to forgive and take the steps to move on.   Extra note: I believe it was wise for Graser to edit this part out. I believe that he recognized that Echo was just trying to joke around, but he knew people would find it rude. He was just trying to help his friend and prevent something like this from happening. I personally do not believe that he was trying to cover up some huge indiscretion."
TheCube,3acb8s,alexchan528,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:22:24 2015 UTC,"I just watched Grape's After-Game Call and it sounded to me like it meant nothing.  When Echooo said that, I though, okay he said that, Ha Ha Ha, we had a good laugh. Just because he sounded rude to you, though, doesn't mean it sounded rude to everyone who watched that video. I even watched a few seconds after, and Dul laughed about it. I really like Echooo, so even if I didn't hear that, it doesn't sound that rude or offensive.  Also, Graser probably cut it out because of the Power Of Editing and needed to shorten the vid. =p"
TheCube,3acb8s,actkms,-4,Fri Jun 19 01:21:55 2015 UTC,"You've got to be kidding me? You really think Graser perfectly took out that one scene, changed what Echo said, to shorten the vid? Lol, you people are hilarious.  And um... Dul did not laugh after it. She defensively said ""I don't even know you"".... no laughing at all..."
TheCube,3a8ajy,UpCHuckedGaming,4,Thu Jun 18 00:38:28 2015 UTC,"I like having a summer and winter getaway islands, but I also want to see more green on the summer island and only a small part of it being sandy. In my opinion having a grassy island and a small beach area would look better than having the whole island be sand. It just looks more natural."
TheCube,3a8ajy,HungCraft,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:41:14 2015 UTC,I think that in the resort or any other island that is where cube events can be held so the spawn don't get crowded. Maybe that can be a good idea. But I like the nature feel of spawn so maybe do that to the resort.

TheCube,3a2iga,Tactical143,5,Tue Jun 16 18:44:55 2015 UTC,"Also, side note. Instead of posting a black screen after you have died in UHC, they should be like some members and post a replay of the UHC footage before they died. This is because sometimes I accidentally hover over the buffering bar when I'm trying to change the quality and it gives you a frame of the video then, and since the quality button is near the end of the video, I accidentally hover over it and see a black screen saying ""I died!"" and get spoiled."

I don't think they need to be changed, because for example, Will's title for his episode ""Hey TYBZI!"". We don't know what happened. Did Will kill TYBZI? Did TYBZI kill Will? Did a baby zombie sneak from behind and kill TYBZI only to kill Will shortly after? We don't know, and even though the suspense may kill us, it's cool to know what to expect!"

You dont have to look at the titles anyway, I watch Grape first (unless Huahwi is in it) all the time, so the other titles dont bother me since I already know what happens :D"

TheCube,3a31zz,airbourne908,2,Tue Jun 16 22:49:27 2015 UTC,I hope Grape does win just because I've had to wait for something like this to happen for Grape since season 3.
TheCube,3a31zz,airbourne908,2,Tue Jun 16 22:51:31 2015 UTC,Here is who I think is killing who in what order:  Grape kills Rusher  Grape kills Tofu  Talekio kills Mitch (Mitch will probably run away from Grape when Grape is a safe distance away)  Grape kills Talekio
TheCube,3a31zz,yoshterra,2,Tue Jun 16 23:40:08 2015 UTC,I feel Joe might take it. His sword's pretty good. His armor is a bit of a problem though.

TheCube,3a31zz,DarkraiTheAccuser,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:29:17 2015 UTC,"This is just like season 11, when Dfield killed everyone. This was my least favorite season. If this occurs again, solo seasons of cube UHC are goners. And if Grape dies, he will complain that it was lag or double team. When you're in full diamond with more than 10 heads/apples, you're obviously going to be the target. No offense to Grape, but he is kindOf a sore loser"
TheCube,3a31zz,Buffalojoe00,5,Tue Jun 16 21:44:25 2015 UTC,"Grape isn't a sore loser, and you'll just be upset since the people you like dont win UHC, season 11 is one of my favourites and I don't even like Dfield. You're kind of overreacting and double teaming is against the rules anyway, so they would get a lot of hate from viewers"
TheCube,3a31zz,xSebtho,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:07:01 2015 UTC,"We have different views. But they are not going to double team him. He is the target, might as well take him out. If you were in Tofuu's position, would you target Grape or Rusher. Be honest."
TheCube,3a31zz,Buffalojoe00,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:10:34 2015 UTC,Oh no I was on about what you said about Grape complaining about getting double teamed

TheCube,3a31zz,Thewalkthruking,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:34:15 2015 UTC,That is so true!!!
TheCube,3a31zz,DaGamer03,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:55:22 2015 UTC,He's not lost yet Buffalo. But they can't outright team against him.  Anyway I think Grape's got it in the bag - Rusher was at 3.5 hearts eating his gapp. (his last one) at the end of his ep. The only problem is Talekio - if he comes and cleans up - It would be really sad.
TheCube,3a31zz,DizzyJargon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:53:11 2015 UTC,"Which, by looking at Grape's Ep, is what they are doing. Joe and Rusher were about 15 blocks away from each other, targeting Grape and trying to get Mitch in on it too. If Grape loss because of that, I'm going to be extremely salty. I hardly like Grape, but it'll still piss me off. It's breaking the clear rules set in the intro of the game, and apparently they don't understand it."
TheCube,3a31zz,DarkenedEclipse,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:49:44 2015 UTC,"I dont think this season is boring. There are three potential winners and two possible winners. Talekio and Tofuu killed some people too.   There may be some big changes in the next episode as messy fights are hard to guess the winners. Like Talekio may come fast enough to get the clean up of Grape after everyone die or else Mitch, Rusher and Tofuu can pull it off and kill Grape."
TheCube,3a31zz,alexchan528,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:31:46 2015 UTC,"I fear that this season is grapes, but if Rusher, Talekio, and maybe if Mr. Mitch doesn't die, then they all might have a chance at taking down Grape if they work together. But that's a long shot."

TheCube,3a31zz,PokePlays,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:14:42 2015 UTC,Tofuu could have caught up with Grape in healing if he'd gotten more Apples. He should've also made some more diamond armor.
TheCube,3a31zz,VernonN,2,Tue Jun 16 22:15:15 2015 UTC,And a diamond sword with Sharp III wouldn't have been bad either
TheCube,3a31zz,Ninjarina24,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:36:04 2015 UTC,"Every season now, I always root for 8bit, Grape, Mitch, Poke, Talekio, Will, and Jwong to get kills. Some have gotten kills this season, but Jwong and Will didn't. Mitch isn't looking too great, but there's a chance."
TheCube,3a31zz,Big_Whiskers,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:40:27 2015 UTC,Grape once again left Tofuu and went for another person. Maybe that was a bad choice later on ;)

TheCube,3a31zz,Mitsuki00,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:30:52 2015 UTC,Ok people are hating this season why? Well Grape does have full diamond and have the most kills but that is because he got lucky. It could of happened to some one else but would people but hating on that. Also don't forget the season is not over. Sorry I had to put this out here.
TheCube,3a31zz,Mitsuki00,2,Wed Jun 17 02:30:24 2015 UTC,"I not hating it.  I loving it.  Even though Grape is probably going to win, there is still that 10% chance of him making a mistake or being out maneuvered.  I looking forward to Thursday's episode. And if Grape wins that would be exciting too.  He played a great season."
TheCube,3a31zz,Ninjarina24,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:39:48 2015 UTC,Well a lot of people are hating it. I love this season because you never know who people are going to run in to 😄

TheCube,3a31zz,Ninjarina24,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:59:34 2015 UTC,I think it would be great if Mitch somehow managed to cleanup the last person and take the UHC. This is coming from someone who has supported grape through every season (apart from when Huahwi was there).
TheCube,3a31zz,cmacgames,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:05:06 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be suprised if Grape won this season, would love it if someone killed him though, it'd be a nice plot twist."
TheCube,3a31zz,_ShadowKirby12_,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:05:54 2015 UTC,I just checked the cube uhc wiki and Grape (currently) has 31 kills over 12 seasons. That is 2.6 kills per season. Who is second  Toffu gaming with 23 over 12 seasons 1.9 per season yet toffu has 3 wins grape only has 1 (as of this episode)
TheCube,3a31zz,Bman_2000,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:36:51 2015 UTC,"I really do want Grape to win because he kind of deserves it. Think about it, he died unfairly in season 4 and 5, and every time he dies, he isn't really salty about it and he compliments the guy who gets him"

Also, there is a really big risk of someone cleaning you up when you're at 0,0 so it really isnt that unfair."
TheCube,3a31zz,16denard,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:23:03 2015 UTC,Did I say I like watching people cave. I just don't like it when one person gets most of the kills and is most likely going to win. I don't like predictable.
TheCube,3a31zz,HumanHashtag9,-2,Thu Jun 18 19:07:19 2015 UTC,Only because you dont like Grape...
TheCube,3a31zz,xSebtho,3,Tue Jun 16 22:08:50 2015 UTC,"Nope.   It's not entertaining when you can predict who will win.  People hate when one person is overpowering others, we always root for the underdog. We see ourselves in the underdog. We are the underdog."
TheCube,3a31zz,shocked_much,2,Tue Jun 16 22:20:41 2015 UTC,There is many possible changes next episode. Talekio can get the clean up. Best Cliffhanger in my opinion.
TheCube,3a31zz,alexchan528,0,Tue Jun 16 23:35:02 2015 UTC,Not much of a cleanup when grape has 32 hearts of healing. I would expect an epic fight between grape and talekio instead. Can't wait for it :D
TheCube,3a31zz,BuildMineSurvive,2,Wed Jun 17 11:37:41 2015 UTC,That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard.  SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?  GRAPE TO GO KILL HIMSELF OR SOMETHING BECAUSE HE'S WINNING?  I don't see the problem with snowballing.  Thats how UHC works.
TheCube,3a31zz,DarthyTMC,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:52:41 2015 UTC,"You cant predict who os going to win, everyone thought CreeperFarts would snowball, he didn't, everyone thought Etho would win Mindcravk S11, he didn't, everyone thought Preston would win the Pack UHC, he didn't. Talekio could take Grape out easily..."
TheCube,3a31zz,xSebtho,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:42:20 2015 UTC,"I like the Pack UHCs because they have some entertaining people's perspectives but, like this most recent one, the entire time it was 3 teams that would obviously be final 3 and win, or at least be the toughest competition. Too predictable, even with some outliers the majority of the season can be guessed.  I haven't watched many Cube UHCs, this is my 2nd or 3rd one, but ones where you can predict who wins does get boring. Since I don't know the other 4 I can't say for sure, but watching this season from Grape's perspective makes it look pretty clear that he's really leading for victory.  Mindcrack seems to be the most impartial because there's a bunch of people there who play differently, have different strats and bring something to the game. In the Cube and the Pack's UHCs, most things were relatively similar between everyone. In the Cube everyone would go 0,0 soon enough and try to fight and gather kills ASAP or hide/run from snowballing Grape, and in The Pack's UHC people played UHC like they always do every season. Mindcrack has Anderzel usually rushing while Pause might sort of rush for a guaranteed kill but plays more strategically while Beef or Etho or whoever will play smart and Aurey and Chad will be noobs but still do well with luck and that's the most exciting since they have the widest range of people who play differently."
TheCube,3a31zz,miaday,0,Wed Jun 17 08:21:27 2015 UTC,"I can tell you Talekio has a better bow, a lot of healing and has won 3 out of the 4 seasons he's played :D  Also UHC is always unpredictable, the most stacked people don't always win, even though this season is in Grapes favour, he is in a kind of 3v1, and Talekio is better at PVP and has really good gear, so..."
TheCube,3a31zz,xSebtho,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:29:52 2015 UTC,"Talekio have Power 2 or 3? I thought it was Power 2 Flame 1 but I also thought Grape had Power 3 which could be better. Flame really is useful but power wise Grape would do more damage, especially since he's full prot 1+ diamond and can tank the extra fire tick."
TheCube,3a31zz,miaday,0,Wed Jun 17 17:26:47 2015 UTC,"But Grape would try to put himself out, meaning Talekio could get 2 or 3 free shots on him"
TheCube,3a31zz,xSebtho,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:16:21 2015 UTC,"Depending on the situation possibly but it's also more than possible to place the water bucket fast. Whenever someone has a flame bow in UHCs I play I just look down and double click the bucket real fast to put me out, so unless Grape's really bad with that he could be more than fine in a bow fight."
TheCube,3a31zz,miaday,0,Wed Jun 17 20:27:13 2015 UTC,"But at that point you aren't looking where the arrows are coming from, and are still for a second, and in that second Talekio could make a shot and hit, meaning this would repeat, over and over"
TheCube,3a31zz,xSebtho,-1,Wed Jun 17 20:44:40 2015 UTC,"Yes the pack uhc did have 3 clear op teams, but the op teams dont always do well, take Pauses teams in Mindcrack season 13 and 15, they were op but in season 13 3/4 of the team was eliminated in the 3rd episode, and in S15 2/3 of Pauses team were eliminated in the 3rd episode also"
TheCube,3a31zz,xSebtho,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:33:18 2015 UTC,"Right, because they all play differently. I haven't seen all of the Cube or all of their UHCs but based on this UHC they all played pretty similarly."

Almost no junk Cube episode like only walking around and introducing new stuff in Cube SMP.  Even in SMP, she kept her style clearly and on the other hand still made clips with other cube members. She did a great balance. But it is sad that keeping her style is also the main reason why she wanted to leave...."

TheCube,3a3erx,Ninjarina24,2,Wed Jun 17 00:44:44 2015 UTC,"I agree that they should branch out to other games. However, it could be difficult for their channel because a majority come for Minecraft. I have seen Cube members playing other games on stream (like CS:GO, agar, etc.) and people have enjoyed it, so it's not out of the question. But I did notice that the viewer count significantly dropped once they switched games, and people will ask them to play Minecraft instead. So they might make one or two other gaming videos that aren't Minecraft, but I can't imagine all full on series. But hey, that's just me rambling nonsense. You never know! :P  PS: They uploaded the Minecraft version of Splatoon because not all of them have a Wii U. It's a bummer too, I want them to play the game in all of its glory!"
TheCube,3a3erx,16denard,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:09:24 2015 UTC,XCom or Invisible Inc or Massive Chalice (Turn Based Games)   It might be funny though cause I know them so well for Minecraft.  i have other Youtubers I watch for other games.

TheCube,3a3erx,SaltyDogPlayz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:17:30 2015 UTC,"A lot of people come to their channel for Minecraft, but I wouldn't be against them having one day a week where they upload a different gaming video, or maybe even like a short vlog just for something different once in awhile."

TheCube,3a0bk7,LexieDoesWhatever,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:17:00 2015 UTC,I think it will be awesome. I dont watch noboom but I will when he uploads. It will be awesome because new member means new ideas and a new person to watch
TheCube,3a0bk7,SuperSlayer5678,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:59:52 2015 UTC,Yes! I think NoBoom will be great!
TheCube,3a0bk7,LeafbladeMC,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:38:18 2015 UTC,"Basincc, let me answer that with a question: Who ISN'T excited to see NoBoom join the Cube?"
TheCube,39ylmv,woelemm,7,Mon Jun 15 21:10:27 2015 UTC,I voted for Will. I expected him to win because honestly he deserved it the most.
TheCube,39ylmv,Musical_Pirate,3,Mon Jun 15 22:22:26 2015 UTC,I agree.
TheCube,39ylmv,PrinceMaxon,8,Mon Jun 15 22:23:43 2015 UTC,"It was to be expected. Honestly not very happy, but congrats to them nevertheless."
TheCube,39ylmv,yoshterra,4,Mon Jun 15 21:25:14 2015 UTC,I voted for Will. I honestly thought he would benefit the cube the most.
TheCube,39ylmv,HumanHashtag9,4,Mon Jun 15 21:35:27 2015 UTC,Agreed.
TheCube,39ylmv,Firewolv,7,Mon Jun 15 21:48:54 2015 UTC,"This was too expected. It was too much like the last election. It was nothing but a popularity contest. Kermit, Poke, Devon, Will, and TYBZI really deserved it more. All Straub did was bribe with his gold blocks and I can't really see them doing anything productive to the Cube. Wanna know what won them the crowns? Subs. That's all. Subs."
TheCube,39ylmv,HumanHashtag9,5,Mon Jun 15 21:57:35 2015 UTC,Kermit and Will especially.
TheCube,39ylmv,DarthyTMC,0,Mon Jun 15 21:59:31 2015 UTC,But you know what? Straub and Bee worked really hard for all their subscribers and have earned the Title king and queen!
TheCube,39ylmv,abbyk997,2,Mon Jun 15 22:29:53 2015 UTC,"I would retreat to this, but in the end I'm just going to get bashed."
TheCube,39ylmv,Andyman27,0,Mon Jun 15 22:44:34 2015 UTC,"True, people should stop hating, it's just a fun title, nothing to get worked up over :D"
TheCube,39ylmv,FredTheWizard,5,Mon Jun 15 22:41:19 2015 UTC,"I voted for Devon. Even though he hasn't been too active on the Cube lately, I think he would have tried really hard and would have been a good king. My second vote was Will because he's done a lot on the server. But congrats to Straub and Bee!"
TheCube,39ylmv,Classic36,2,Mon Jun 15 22:11:23 2015 UTC,To be honest this was the most predictable elections ever like I wasn't really waiting for the results I was just waiting for them to announce them as winner.
TheCube,39ylmv,lolxddavid,3,Mon Jun 15 22:50:56 2015 UTC,"I voted for Straub, but not too happy with Bee winning. I was expecting it though. Congrats to both.  People voted based on popularity and their favorites rather than voting someone who would benefit the Cube and do a better job. Straub and Will would have been perfect."
TheCube,39ylmv,Buffalojoe00,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:43:29 2015 UTC,Also agreed.
TheCube,39ylmv,yoshterra,3,Mon Jun 15 21:49:05 2015 UTC,Will and TYBZI for next King & Queen
TheCube,39ylmv,alaqazam,3,Mon Jun 15 22:07:56 2015 UTC,I sense a dictatorship. Straub is forcing people to go to school and Bee had her competition executed. Won't take long before they start building a wall to keep the Cube members in.

TheCube,39ylmv,DarthyTMC,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:32:40 2015 UTC,I was thinking that too xD
TheCube,39ylmv,handsome_jack_jr,2,Tue Jun 16 00:59:44 2015 UTC,Yeah Straub and Bee. I voted for Straub.
TheCube,39ylmv,Paliane,0,Mon Jun 15 21:24:47 2015 UTC,Same here :D (even though my flair is grapy)

TheCube,39ylmv,Mitsuki00,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:27:18 2015 UTC,I voted Straub and Bee :D so my dreams came true :D

TheCube,39ylmv,Eug10099,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:57:14 2015 UTC,"THat's if you only have 1 IP address, I have like 4/5"
TheCube,39ylmv,kiezzykilla,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:59:59 2015 UTC,"I understand everyone initially thinking that Bee would be a bad queen. In the past, she hasn't really shown much initiative in helping the community too much, but I feel with this new title, it really could be her chance to actually start being one of the more productive members of the server, and help organize events, and even do things that people wouldn't expect of her. If you asked me a year ago if Bee should be the leader of cube, I too would probably have disagreed with the current decision like you guys as well, but I feel lately she has grown a lot as a person and a player and has really showed she could be capable of leading the cube.  I surely open to what you guys think about this as well, so feel free to let me know how you feel :)"
TheCube,39ylmv,HoodieGirlMC,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:57:21 2015 UTC,"Damn, I wanted Will as King and Tybzi as queen :("

TheCube,39ylmv,brady11,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:52:59 2015 UTC,"I don't really think that these two deserved the titles the won- mostly earned because they are the most popular ship on The Cube. I don't really think Bee is that beneficial to the Cube's economy and structure, but Straub is. I am content with the new leader."
TheCube,39ylmv,HumanHashtag9,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:57:31 2015 UTC,"I wanted Will to win, but ohh well.. Congrats!"

So I voted for Will.  But Yes I am still happy with the Duo."

TheCube,39ywhi,yoshterra,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:57:42 2015 UTC,"There may be more members, but they're probably thinking they should spread out the time between a new member comes."
TheCube,39ywhi,Classic36,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:11:17 2015 UTC,Maybe they'll all be added in upcoming episodes instead of all at once.
TheCube,39ywhi,EggCouncilCreeper,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:53:31 2015 UTC,Well put. It's not like anyone's forcing people to watch NoBoom's perspective.

TheCube,39uarc,estoniass,2,Sun Jun 14 22:26:41 2015 UTC,Trucing between Mitch and Tofuu actually ended near the end of this Episode ;).  Mitch was lying that he was skybasing and thinking whether he should fight Tofuu just below Tofuu a few blocks. I think Mitch thought he cant win Tofuu at this moment so Mitch didnt sneak up.(Mitch definitely correct)  Tofuu at the end said he is going to kill Mitch later and Mitch heard it. XD They truced the final time and it was over. :P

I normally just go with the 55 year old joke thing xD but ya I think he is 18-20 maybe and people have been speculating that his name is Zach and his last name is Graser maybe? That's why he chose it. I looked up the definition of graser and this came up: Acronym for: Gamma Ray Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.

I also watch Graser, Straub, and H sometimes but not as much like not all the whole episode. I also watch Grape from time to time and I watch Parker's when he uploads them. As for who I think gets the most views, probably Bee, Graser, Straub, and Kermit (when he uploads them) because I think they have the biggest fanbases."

TheCube,39rjlf,DarkenedEclipse,3,Sun Jun 14 01:38:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bad idea because let's say Grape was a captain. He would probably pick AMAZING pvpers like for example huahwi, mark, talekio, etc. And then the rest captains would be confused as to who they should pick"
TheCube,39rjlf,GoldenNoodles21,3,Sun Jun 14 02:34:38 2015 UTC,"If anybody was a captain, they'd be picking the best players. The problem is that you're predicting a scenario where people pass up arguably the best UHC participants in Cube UHC for different people. If a Captains game were to happen, the best players would be out in the first few picks. If you aren't understanding what I mean, here's a small version of what I mean:  There are five captains, and those captains are Grape, Graser, Pokediger, Straub, and Bayani. Graser goes first and gets Dfield, then Poke chooses Tofuu, Straub chooses CreeperFarts, Grape chooses Tomahawk, and Bayani chooses Talekio. Respectivelly, these are more than likely the best players of Cube UHC based on skill at the game. The best players are gone, and Grape only got one of those best players.   It's not like you choose all your players at once and that's it. Although, that's what I believe you think is going on. You're imagining a situation where if Grape and Graser were to choose teammates first, Grape would choose Dfield, CreeperFarts, Tomahawk, and Talekio right away. That would probably give Graser to choose Tofuu, Poke, NoBoom, and Bayani. These players aren't necessarily bad, but comparing them to Grape's team, they aren't better. This does not happen in Captains teams as there are turns.  And then my slight-rant ends there. Also, I doubt Huahwi will be back for a while so I didn't really list him here."
TheCube,39rjlf,demcmd,0,Sun Jun 14 03:45:00 2015 UTC,"BTW, if that was an actual team ( with Grape huahwi mark talekio) no one should play that uhc, its an automatic win."
TheCube,39rjlf,GoldenNoodles21,2,Sun Jun 14 02:35:31 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, it's not an automatic win if the team did go like that. Sure, it's a really good team but nothing is guaranteed. And about the other captains being confused as who to pick, you only get to pick one person at a time. So it'd be Grape's turn, then say Graser's, then the others until it goes back to Grape."
TheCube,39rjlf,GoldenNoodles21,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:44:57 2015 UTC,Ahhhh I get ya now.
TheCube,39rjlf,abbyk997,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:10:52 2015 UTC,"This could be a pretty good idea especially if they were doing at least 4 people to a team, but it would be hard to get someone who you really wanted on your team when there's more than just 3 or 4 teams. Whoever got to choose last wouldn't get their ideal teammates."
TheCube,39rjlf,Dylan_Cube,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:10:21 2015 UTC,There should be a random generator that chooses captains and their picking order!
TheCube,39rjlf,HumanHashtag9,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:19:09 2015 UTC,"I love the captains gamemode, but I could see this causing drama with people hating people for ""why did you leave this person last!"" and ""why didn't you choose person!"". It also could make the last few picks upset."
TheCube,39r42m,abbyk997,2,Sat Jun 13 22:59:30 2015 UTC,That's mixing in hunger games too much. I don't think that's a good idea. They are two different game types.

TheCube,39r42m,TheGreedyGoblin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:10:12 2015 UTC,"That seems like a decent idea. For an ideal UHC situation, you want it to be somewhat fast based at the start, but you want to let most of the people survive till at least episode 3. My idea is teams of 2, but how about the the teams are random, the first person who you find in the wilderness being your teammate (Keeping the ""Cube copying Mindcrack"" pattern going xD). This way it would be sort of intense at the beggining with people searching around for their partners."

(i was able to do it BTW) and sometimes it happens if things are not working properly."

TheCube,392rom,FredTheWizard,11,Mon Jun 8 20:57:42 2015 UTC,"Learning wasn't bad at all. Sure, from a host perspective, he may have seen some of the errors he made as horrendous and world-ending.. but truth be told, from this point forward, absolutely nothing really went wrong.  The season was not tainted by any means. The worst that happened was some perma kill delay at the beginning, when the night and day cycle refused to change after a death occurrence, which I simply edited out of my episodes."
TheCube,392rom,graser10,5,Tue Jun 9 06:19:37 2015 UTC,"You perspective is fine, it's other peoples'. They could have easily edited their episodes too though I guess.  It just could have gone much better. Everything, including the permakill failure, came from the border size. Tybzi obviously died when he didn't come within the border quick enough, which set it to night - then I set the time to day manually and didn't reset the permakill so it still thought it was night and turned it to day upon Straub's death."
