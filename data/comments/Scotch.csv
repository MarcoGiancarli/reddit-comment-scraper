Taste: Peat, meaty fruit, plum sherry, light salted kipper. Light to medium mouthfeel.   Finish: Smoke holds longer than the fruit and sherry. Medium length.  Notes: I was able to pick this up on sale regular price in my area is $100. This is a 16 year that’s finished for a year in PX casks. This is a nice sweeter take on Lavavulin, however I still like the 12 Year better, and the 16 is a better value.  87/100"
Scotch,3e37ut,Doglikehorse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:46:01 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely my favourite whisky at the moment. Way better than the 16 IMO,  I managed to find an 18yr old distillers edition in an airport in Turkey, which blew my mind. It was amazing.  Great stuff."
Scotch,3e37ut,kuunamatata,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:17 2015 UTC,I can't seem to find this or anything of Lagavulin for cheaper than $100 where I live.  It's very disappointing because it's my favorite scotch but I can't justify it every time I'm getting something from the liquor store.
Scotch,3e37ut,kuunamatata,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:15:43 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry! I know that where I am we get a pretty fair price.  You should try to make friends with someone who can get you a employee discount.

Scotch,3e2vau,treydog9999,6,Tue Jul 21 15:15:53 2015 UTC,"Johnnie Walker Black Label Review.  This is one of the first real blends I have had. With Monkey Shoulder being a vatted malt. I have had this before but was not really into scotch and it was several years ago. So i was excited to try this again with proper techniques and hopefully a better palate.    Tasted in a glencairn glass neat and with water.  50 ml sample bottled at 40% abv   Appearance Amber +2. Thin fast legs that bead down the side. One of the darker whisky i have drank but we know it has e150a Nose Alcohol / astringent smell right off the bat leading to smoke. Then very subtly behind that we have vanilla, and some almost islay flavors. W/ water gives up lemon and citrus, heather, malt, And some orange rind.  Taste fruits,  orange, wood, and sweetness in front. Then some honey and spiced brown sugar in back. W/ water much more sweet honey but the wood disappears into a malty yeasty flavor. Finish Smoked salt very talisker like. W/ water smoke turns more salty. The finish is actually decently long and slightly lingering but not too long.  Conclusion Honestly I liked this blend. Some rough edges possibly from the grains giving it some acetone notes. But overall a decent dram. I would happily drink this in a bar or someones home as a guest. I do really like Caol Ila and Talisker which I believe are in here which is maybe why i am getting the notes i like out of it.  I would even consider buying this if I had no single malts in the price range or am somewhere with poor selection. Score 86/100"

Scotch,3e2gam,TOModera,10,Tue Jul 21 13:11:50 2015 UTC,"Back at The Feather's Pub again, drinking away a little stress. Not in that alcoholic way. More so in that ""Taking an hour to pick apart a dram so I don't have to think about my exam in a week"" way. That doesn't involve getting drunk.  It's a complicated life.  My wife has bought a new camera. Thus it's the perfect time for me to buy an expensive dram at a pub I like.  That's my story, and I'm sticking to it. Also I wanted to try some of this before other whisky nerds found out they had it and stormed the castle, as it were.  I really didn't think I'd ever have a chance to try Bruichladdich Black Art 2. I own Numero 4, I fluked into a swap for Numero 3, and I've written off Numero 1 as lost to the ages. Also I missed buying Numero 2 because it was a tad expensive.  And I'm an idiot.  For those of you who don't know, little is released about the Black Art series. It's made by Jim McEwan who tells no one else what he's doing with it. You have an age statement, an Abv that seems to denote cask strength, and an influence that seems to denote sherry casks.  So, I'm lucky enough to try this, so let's see if it was worth $24 an ounce.  Price: No Longer available at the LCBO  Region: Islay  Age: 21 years  Vintage: 1989  Abv: 49.7%  Colour: 7.5 YR 3/10  Nose: Strawberry, anise, currant, chocolate, toffee, ginger, cinnamon, floral, plum, Sprite, raspberry, peanuts, blackberry pie, spruce trees  Holy crap. /u/dustlesswalnut was right about this one...This is right mental.  You get one note at a time. Nothing clashes at all. Any good notes that pair well may come forward together, yet never anything bad.  Hot damn I could write notes on this all day. So complex.  Taste: Lemon, butter, currant, toffee, leather, chestnut, BBQ sauce, anise, pepper bacon  Bit more 'reserved' on the taste, if only because the nose was a little more random and complicated.  That's not to say this isn't the tits. Because this is amazing tits. And if you're not into tits, just replace tits with whatever body part you really like. Or ice cream, or something else. It's that.  There's a light smoke mixed with a buttery acidic note and some nuts and spice and a lot more.  Finish: Baking with my grandmother, cranberry, smoke, mushroom, butter, swimming in a lake, smoked cheddar, ginger, elk tenderloin  I guess I should clarify: Sometimes really good whisky sets off memories. This one did that. Thus it's already one of the better ones.  The baking note reminds me of spices, different ingredients, chocolate, excitement, new opportunities, and doing something I love, with someone I loved quite a bit.  The swimming note goes to a mixture of freshness, outside smells/flavours, algae, lily pad flowers, and happiness.  Conclusion: Well damn, this is amazing. Honestly, buy it. Just go and buy it. It's complex, crazy, and a lot of fun.  Did it set off memories left, right and center? No, however it's quite complex. Not the best whisky, but really, really fucking close to the best whisky. Kinda like how panties aren't the best thing on the planet, but they're next to the best thing.  Or to put it in a way that may not make you uncomfortable: This is a complex, amazingly well put together dram. The 3 had the issue that the complexity was there, however it was paired back and disorganized. The 2 does the nose right, the taste right, and the finish beautifully.  You may not enjoy it if you can't wrap your head around it being hard to pin down.  90/100  Scotch review #343, Islay review #76, Whisky Network review #510  1001 Whiskies to taste before you die review #240  Other Bruichladdich reviews:   Bruichladdich - BR5 - Elements of Islay Bruichladdich 10 year - The Laddie Ten Bruichladdich 15 year Old Bruichladdich 16 year old First Growth Cuvée A: Pauillac (Chateau Lafite) Bruichladdich 35 year Douglas Laing Old Malt Cask Bruichladdich Bere Barley 2006 Bruichladdich Black Art 3 Bruichladdich DNA 4th Edition MCMLXXXV Bruichladdich Octomore 03.1 Bruichladdich Port Charlotte An Turas Mor Bruichladdich Port Charlotte Scottish Barley Heavily Peated Bruichladdich Resurrection 2001 Bruichladdich the Classic Laddie Scottish Barley"

Scotch,3e31tj,CandyMan77,4,Tue Jul 21 16:03:00 2015 UTC,"Like a lot of people on this sub, I tend towards Single Malts which I generally prefer (this may mean I’ve fallen victim to a clever marketing ploy, actually, but I digress). Nevertheless, I was pleased with a gift of Pig’s Nose Blended Whisky with its charming branding. You can read about that, and the full tasting notes here at Sublime Imbibing, if you're so inclined.  Appearance: They likely got a bit carried away with the caramel colouring, as this scotch looks a little too dark-and-handsome for a young whisky. It pours viscous and clear.  Nose: Slaps you with alcohol fumes and iodine, but mellows into almonds and peaches. My first impression was “Uh-oh” but I quickly grew more hopeful as I continued to sniff.  Taste: Let’s be honest – it’s not exactly going to blow anyone’s mind. But Pig’s Nose has an intensely grainy taste, with undertones of molasses and dried fruit. It reminds me of nothing so much as a big bowl of oatmeal made by a fibre-conscious eater. It’s actually pretty good, but I’d say suffers a bit from an odd bitterness and being a tad too simple.  Finish: Sweet, nutty and not overly long, Pig’s Nose leaves you with the firm handshake of an amiable drinking companion.  Overall, 77/100. I might be being a bit generous, but I genuinely enjoyed this scotch. Its branding is solid, its taste is good, and it was a fine gift. What are your thoughts, folks?"

Scotch,3e4fgs,Wissky,2,Tue Jul 21 21:55:58 2015 UTC,"You probably already know this, but that flavor in the 17yr likely doesn't come from actual peat usage.  You might also like Glengoyne if you like Macallan.  Glengoyne is a great value."
Scotch,3e4fgs,quercus_robur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:21:30 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that actually. Where does it come from?  I'll give Glengoyne a shot next time I'm at the scotch bar. I like Macallan well enough, but it's a little mellow for my taste. I prefer the lively, malty quality that Glenfarclas has. Maybe it's because I'm used to bourbon, but I tend to like scotches that others find rough around the edges."
Scotch,3e4fgs,quercus_robur,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:04:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure quite what you're describing, so I can't say where it comes from.  It likely comes from either the oak tannins, the sulfur dioxide used to preserve the sherry cask, or the distillate.  OK, don't bother too much with Glengoyne if you want something rougher.  Have you had Balvenie 12yr Doublewood?  I find it the most bourbon-like.  Have you had Aberlour A'bunadh?  That's sherried and can be rougher."
Scotch,3e4fgs,Rallerboy888,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:21:36 2015 UTC,"Now, I'd go for the 15 myself, however, there are other opportunities to take into consideration. The Glenfarclas 105 is 120 US proof and damn delicious! I don't know the American price for it, but it is the same price as the 12 in most duty-free stores. Aberlour also makes some nice sherried whisky; the a'Bunadh in particular is nice."
Scotch,3e4fgs,Razzafrachen,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:17:06 2015 UTC,The 105 is expensive in the US. Like $80-90. Probably cheaper to buy in Europe and pay for shipping. So silly!
Scotch,3e2fzd,TOModera,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:08:29 2015 UTC,"There's times in your life where you need to go do something to take some pressure off.  Hypothetically, let's say you've recently started a new job,are finishing a very detail oriented class, having a major milestone birthday for a parental unit that you're close to, tying to find a gift for a friend and a relative, and have two desserts to bake, some jam to make up, and you still work (and can't take a day off).  Hypothetically, of course. What do you do? Why you find the solution to your problems at a bar, of course!  No, you go do something that is fun to relax yourself. Then you get back to studying.  My relaxing endeavor was an impromptu visit to The Feather's Pub and do some reviews. Not get drunk, just have a nice bit of food (Mac and Cheese) and do some reviews (prior to the Mac and Cheese).  Old Fettercairn 10 is a dusty whisky back from back before 2002. Back when we were all innocent and shit. I've had a few Fettercairn's, and I'm growing happily fond of them. Not fondly happy though, more so happily fond. I'm happy to have found them, yet not found them happy. As such, I thought I needed to try it back before it was young and old when it was old, and therefore, young.  It's odd that I ordered a Highland to relax, but I did. Probably because I thought it was on a list of things to try that I actually didn't try. Or maybe because I was trying to not delay and be a good customer.  Or maybe because I needed something that wasn't too pricey so I could save up for my next dram (foreshadowing...)  So, let's see how it tastes, shall we?  Price: N/A  Region: Highland  Abv: 43%  Colour: 7.5Y 8/6  Nose: Honey, cinnamon, floral, coffee, pear  Really floral. A little bit of peat in this dram leads to a spicey, earthy tone. This is light peat done correctly: Not just there, more so adding to the dram.  It is quite simple though, however it's floral coffee cinnamon, so I can't fault it too much on being simple.  Taste: Honey, rose water, salt, ginger, cereal  More floral. Like floral? Get in the van!...  And we'll drop you at the florist? What am I on?  Okay, it's floral, and there's light cereal notes. Not much else. It's young, has a nice mouthfeel, kinda simple, but it cleans up. Like the workers at McDonald's.  Finish: Cumin, pear, pepper, coffee, grit  Hot finish, and kinda gritty. The first place where the earth is doing a little too much work. Again, like the workers at McDonald's.   Conclusion: I think this is one of the first earthy drams that I've had that I can say is well suited for a warm day. It's not refreshing, yet it's simple and nice to sip on. Also reminds me of flowers.  It was a good way to relax. Nothing too strenuous. Given this is a dusty, it probably (see: does) sell for more than it's worth. Last price I saw was $150, which it's not worth unless you're a collector, and if that's the case, you're collecting because it's old, not because of what it tastes like.  Try it if you can for a okay amount.  75/100  Scotch review #342, Highland review #56, Whisky Network review #509  Other Fettercairn reviews:   Fettercairn Fasque Fettercairn Signatory Vintage 1996"
Scotch,3e3jof,GreatGonzo,4,Tue Jul 21 18:05:14 2015 UTC,"Very few distilleries allow it.  Arran might, and a few others.  It's expensive, and almost impossible if you aren't located in the U.K.  You would likely have to buy a full barrel, not a ""small barrel"", pay annual rent, pay taxes upon it being dumped, pay for bottling, and then pay tax on each bottle.  You would have to arrange for your own exporter if you're not in the U.K.  If you're in the U.S., you'll also have to find an importer, get TTB label approval, find a distributor in your state to sell to your retailer, find a retailer, and then pay retail cost for the bottles."
Scotch,3e3jof,quercus_robur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:19:28 2015 UTC,Are you located in Ottawa?  I assume it's very difficult to import your own liquor through the LCBO.
Scotch,3e3jof,quercus_robur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:26:52 2015 UTC,"I am, but for a load like that, I would probably import to another province, then road trip it back home. Or send it to some friends in the States."
Scotch,3e3jof,quercus_robur,2,Tue Jul 21 19:36:52 2015 UTC,"Like I said, this isn't the same as shipping a few bottles to friends in the U.S.  You'll need to find an importer, get label approval from the federal government, find a distributor, and then find a retailer.  You can't piecemeal it, and the bottles won't have any label on them because they're not the same commercial product the distillery sells.  This would end up being a pallet of bottles that you would need to import.  And you wouldn't be able to import it into the U.S. without at least two to three other companies involved, plus likely a customs broker.  In Canada you can probably skip at least one of those steps, but you'll still need 2-3 other companies."
Scotch,3e3jof,quercus_robur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:52:25 2015 UTC,"Lets pretend that money is not an issue.  What companies would I need?  Would it all be handled by a broker, or are these things I would have to arrange myself. As far as I can tell, I would need a bottling company to handle that process, and then I guess a broker to ship it all for me, but why do I need a label approval if I'm not reselling it or if they don't have a label at all?  Also if I can't get the distilleries I have in mind, are there any in Canada that allow a custom made single malt barrel?  That would simplify things a bit.  I thought there was a company in NS and BC that did this, but I haven't looked it up in a while."
Scotch,3e3jof,slanderousu,2,Tue Jul 21 20:11:56 2015 UTC,"I have no idea, especially into Canada.  The distillery can arrange bottling for you and will have an export connection you can use, but otherwise they'll tell you you're on your own.  Regarding the U.S.: You'll need label approval because you can't import unlabeled bottles, and the bottles are for retail resale (even if all of the sales will be to you)--remember that in the U.S., no producer or distributor can sell directly to a consumer.  So you'll need an importer, distributor, and retailer.  The importer may be able to recommend a distributor.  You'll still need to find a retailer willing to handle all the paperwork and logistics of segregating your bottles for you.  Back in Scotland, you'll also have to work with the bottler to make sure to bottle in 750ml quantities, since 700ml bottles are not allowed in the U.S.  Once you get label approval, you'll need to get the bottles labeled in Scotland, and the importer will take care of shipping and a customs broker, and pass those costs onto the distributor, to pass along to the retailer, who will set a retail price for you to buy your bottles.  So you'll have to find these companies willing to do all this work for the few hundred bottles you get, get them to keep track of this extra pallet of product just for you instead of it getting lost or diverted to other retailers along the way, and you'll likely pay at least $80 per bottle.  As a baseline, I believe the U.K. taxes and bottling comes to around $13 per bottle, not counting the actual whisky, U.S. duties, and all the U.S.-side handling."
Scotch,3e3jof,quercus_robur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:38:57 2015 UTC,"hmmm.  You've given me a lot to digest here.  Thanks for the info.  I knew about the importer and the distributor, but didn't realize that then I had to give the retailer its pound of flesh as well."
Scotch,3e3jof,celocanth13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:30:32 2015 UTC,"My $10,000 or more estimate is looking a little low after consideration - I hadn't thought about UK taxes and distribution/shipping costs.  I wonder if it would be simpler (or possible) to contract a distiller in the US to do the importing/paperwork/paininthedickness this would require."
Scotch,3e3jof,quercus_robur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:39:15 2015 UTC,"I can't remember the details, but last I looked into it it was going to cost ~$45 per bottle (~$10,000) to get the bottles out of Scotland, with the U.S. duties and distribution still left to pay.  That's for something like an 8yr product watered down to 46%.  The importer is likely in the best position to do this work.  It's how K&L and Binny's bring in their own barrels from Scotland.  A sophisticated retailer would know how to get it done with the right partners, but you would have to convince them to take time out of their busy days to help you.  If you could talk someone like K&L into it, they could get the usual importer of Arran to bring it in for you, but you likely need to have connections."
Scotch,3e3jof,slanderousu,2,Tue Jul 21 22:12:10 2015 UTC,"Also, theres no guarantee that some random barrel of 21 yo scotch will actually be any good."
Scotch,3e3jof,trey_man,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:04:20 2015 UTC,True.  I don't think most distilleries that offer barrels even promise to let you store your barrel that long.
Scotch,3e3jof,Razzafrachen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:14:09 2015 UTC,"Could probably grease some palms to get it done.  A cool $20,000 would get something decent I bet."
Scotch,3e3jof,staggosaurusrex,4,Tue Jul 21 22:36:27 2015 UTC,"I also have a 2 month old and will be keeping an eye out for single casks that were distilled on her birthday as she ages so that we might be able to crack open something special when she turns 21, or whatever.   However, I'm always confused by the concept of buying whisky as a future gift for the child. A barrel of 10 year aged bourbon is going to cost about $6k, and an 20+ year single malt would be much more. Now your kid is the proud owner of 120+ bottles of (hopefully) good single malt from a bourbon barrel or hogshead. Let's hope she a) likes whisky b) has space to store her bottles and c) wouldn't rather have the $30k+ that investing that money when she was a kid would have netted her.   Are you sure this isn't a graduation gift for you?"
Scotch,3e3jof,ChrisSlicks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:51:24 2015 UTC,"You nailed it. Doesn't seem like a good return on investment for a college grad gift. Back when I graduated college, beer was my drink. Whuh, 120 bottles of Arran?! Thanks dad? I guess I'll invite my friends over for shots."
Scotch,3e3jof,Jyrchi,2,Tue Jul 21 20:27:51 2015 UTC,"I have a newborn as well and have been pondering this. I think I've landed on it being a safer bet to get a half dozen bottles that were bottled this year. And then down the line, additional ones that were distilled in the birth year. Less risk. More variety. Less money."

Scotch,3e3jof,thatllberight,2,Wed Jul 22 00:58:00 2015 UTC,"Well, it's possible for some distilleries, but ""small barrel"" is a relative concept. The smallest I've seen for sale are around 200 litres, which is also very expensive. But if you can get some friends into the deal, it might not be so bad. Aging is a bit hard of a task to pull off in very small casks, so the barrels are big.  From what I've seen, not many distilleries sell their casks though. You can get some via Whisky broker and Arran had some cask sales recently. Whisky broker also has quite a good read on the matter itself. Unfortunately I think Lagavulin doesn't sell theirs."
Scotch,3e3jof,quazi4moto,2,Tue Jul 21 18:21:40 2015 UTC,"A fantastic idea, a horrible reality.   If you can find some way to do it without taking out a second mortgage let me know, because i'd love to do the same thing. Right down to the Lagavulin."
Scotch,3e3jof,slanderousu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:58:57 2015 UTC,"There are quite a few distilleries that will do this. If you have a look and post on whiskywhiskywhisky or raymondarmstrong you'll get a few pointers. On top of the initial cost, probably in the region of $1500, you'll pay warehousing costs and will have to pay bottling, labelling, duty and Vat costs when you take the whisky. Whiskybroker estimates £3.00 each to label and bottle whisky. Current duty and vat add is about £35 per litre of pure alcohol in the UK (probably a lot less where you are).  It presents a few problems - a full barrel, hogshead or butt amounts to rather a lot of bottles of whisky - while the effect of wood on spirit in a small barrel for 20+ years is likely to be disastrous.  The whisky you end up with is going to end up being a lot cheaper than buying at retail.  It shouldn't be too difficult to have it transported to a warehouse near you, brokers will arrange this for you.  Lots of distilleries and brokers will allow you to have cask samples throughout the maturation period.  EDIT: I don't believe Lagavulin have done any cask sales for several years and quite a few other distilleries have ceased doing this in the last few years - I wouldn't be surprised to see most of them resuming private sales in future."
Scotch,3e10vs,Ethanized,3,Tue Jul 21 03:15:16 2015 UTC,"Blind sample tasting, courtesy of u/rintintin757 or something, thank you! Per the usual, the sample was tasted blind initially, with notes in italics added during the second (revealed) tasting if I found anything important.     MaCallan Cask Strength – 58.1%    Category Notes    Setup: Neat, INAO, rested 20 minutes.   Color: Chocolate milk – I can barely see through the liquid it’s so dark.   Nose: It’s sherried. I knew this was one of two sherried whiskeys based on the feel of the label, but there’s no difficulty sensing that on the nose. Loads of sherry, though there’s a background of this wild-strawberry jam my grandma used to make back in the day. Which is great for a jam, but it smells like it’s going to be a sugar-bomb of a whiskey =( I’m glad it wasn’t 25/30   Taste: All sherry, all the time. But it’s nice – not horribly sweet and not overly dry. All natural grape jelly comes to mind as the predominant flavor, maybe even closer to black currant. 28/30   Body: Mild warmth, light body. 7/10   Finish: The finish is a little sharp, probably exacerbated by the dry sherry finish. The grapes hang on through the process, adding a nice complexity. The sherry character builds up a little, becoming just a touch cloying. 26/30   Score: 86/100   Value: 2/5 @ $100 (secondary?) for 750ml (5 = must buy; 4 = good buy; 3 = priced right; 2 = overpriced; 1 = avoid).       Scotch avg. score to date: 85     I had a taste of the Amrut Intermediate Sherry before this, and if that one is sherry-forward, the Mac CS is Sherry forward, backward, and all around. At secondary, I would say anything over $70 is a bit much since there are other options readily available. I can see why people love it, especially if you paid retail for the bottle. It’s one of the better sherried whiskies I’ve had so far, though I don’t know if that’s saying much. The nose was the weakest point to me, as it was extremely sweet, but the palate and finish proved to be more enjoyable."

Scotch,3e06c7,HawkI84,7,Mon Jul 20 23:05:20 2015 UTC,"When Mark Reynier purchased Bruichladdich in 2000, it had been silent for 5 years or so, save a couple weeks in 1998 when this, and what ended up as the other 1998 sherry edition (Manzanilla, I believe) was produced. I haven’t found a lot of info about this one - the only review or write-up I’ve found regarding it is on Serge’s site, and he mentions there that roughly 6000 of these were produced.  46% abv. Non chill filtered/no color added. There’s a 10 year age statement on the back of the bottle as well. Thanks to /u/dlofx for picking this up for me at a college town liquor store that doesn’t move a lot of single malt.  Nose - I get vanilla first and foremost, but with a very solid sherry backbone - there’s dark chocolate, raisins, gingerbread, fruitcake, clove, black pepper, allspice, almonds, and maybe a little anise as well. Very nice complexity given the relatively young age. I get a bit of those salty/oceany notes when I start looking for them too, but with Bruichladdich I practically look for those by reflex anymore so take that for what it’s worth.  Taste - Honey and vanilla at first, transitioning in to the sherry notes - dark chocolate, dark dried fruit, gingerbread that’s borderline burnt, fruitcake, black pepper, and allspice. The spice is fairly mild here. Interesting mix of the honey/vanilla notes and the “darker” sherried ones. Medium to medium plus body, with a nice kind of velvety feel.  Finish -Dark chocolate, honey, black pepper, cinnamon, with the Laddie’s briney notes making an appearance as well. Those somewhat salty oceany notes have a way of making it seem almost fresh, which I’ve found to be true of many Bruichladdich’s...maybe all of the one’s I’ve had, actually.  I like this one a lot, but I’m also kind of a Bruichladdich fanboy. While the oloroso notes this has are quite nice, and remind me in some ways of my departed Black Art 3.1 bottle (the BA was better), I think I prefer the bourbon-cask driven profile of The Laddie Ten just slightly to this one. The lighter golden fruit notes help highlight that freshness The Laddie’s spirit has, I think, while with this one it almost seems like the Oloroso notes sit on top of the vanilla and honey (not really competing with them, but not really integrated either...not sure I’m explaining this all that well). This is still a very solid whisky, though, and I’m very happy to have had a chance to get some.  87/100"
Scotch,3e19v0,Comintern,3,Tue Jul 21 04:38:13 2015 UTC,"Ardbeg 10  Good evening gentlemen this is my 10th review and nets me my first level of tartan! Anyways without further ado here's the review.  Price: $96 CAD   ABV: 46%  Colour: Pale yellow. Close to apple juice. Very very pale.  Nose: Smoke, lemon, sea water, light vanilla, some honey sweetness towards the back and very faint apple. Lots of peat smoke as to be expected but still fairly complicated.  Taste: Nice full peat smoke with some sea salt. It's less of a medicinal peat smoke taste but there's still hints of iodine. There's also a good balance of sweetness to keep everything in check.  Mouthfeel: thick and full  Finish: Big peat smoke finish. A long lingering fiery smoke with a faint honey like sweetness right at the end that ties things up nicely  Verdict: This one's a winner. If you're a fan of peat this is damned fine dram. I haven't had Laphroaig 10 to compare the two properly but prior to this Laphroaig Quarter Cask was probably my favourite scotch.  I'm gonna be sad when this bottle is empty.

Scotch,3e10wd,WhiskeyMasterRace,3,Tue Jul 21 03:15:24 2015 UTC,"Good evening /r/scotch! Time for another review, this time it's a more standard offering from a well regarded distillery. I found a bottle of the 18 at a whole in the wall liquor store and decided to pull the trigger. That being my only experience with the distillery, I decided that I should try their entry level 12 year old and A recent swap with /u/tintin777 brought me a sample of it. Let's see how this guy is!    Caol Ila 12yr, Islay Single Malt, 43% ABV, $60ish locally  Nose Smokey citrus fruit, scented hand soap, almond paste, slight earthiness, olive oil, brine. Interesting notes here, nothing too complex. I can't say that soap is an appealing note. 7/10  Taste Smooth smokiness, toffee, bitter coffee, malt, salt, earthy peat, orange zest. Good notes, exactly what I expect from an Islay, it's a little bit rough around the edges though. 42/50  Body Medium body, slightly syrupy, leaves behind just a little bit of oil. Just a tad too thick for the flavor profile. 9/10  Finish Long and smokey, a bit of ash, slightly acidic and sour. 15/20  Value This is a decent whisky, maybe a little expensive, but it's real crime is not being better or cheaper than Laphroiag or Ardbeg 10. This can't score too highly due to that. 6/10    Overall As I said, in my opinion this whisky doesn't measure up to Ardbeg or Laphroaig and is at its cheapest the same price as the two. Interesting notes on the noes with typical fare elsewhere. I'd recommend it to someone looking to expand their horizons (like myself) but I don't know if I would get behind this as a usual bottle in my cabinet.

Scotch,3e0jt3,BadgerHawkville,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:32:05 2015 UTC,"It was quite drinkable actually and something I would use to introduce someone who is new to scotch into the world of what it can be. Being that we don't get access to IBs here, this would be the closest we could get. The other 2 bottlings however are definitely the ones of note and merit having in inventory."
Scotch,3e0jt3,slanderousu,4,Tue Jul 21 21:53:18 2015 UTC,"These reviews are a bit shorter as I got a very pleasant surprise the other morning. I ended up receiving a text from my local store contact asking me to stop by as he was going to open one up. Well, one turned into 3 and well, the rest as they say is history!  Mortlach Rare Old - bottled at 43%  Nose: honey and clover  Palate: Honey, some vanilla and light spice  Finish: short and forgettable - so much that I didn't have anything written :(  This was a pleasant dram, but not overly complex for the short time I had with it, nor did it really grab my attention that I want to be bringing a bottle home. 80/100  Next up, are 2 distilleries I've never had experience with before, so I'm really rather looking forward to finding what they have to offer.  Caol Ila 15 - bottled at 60.38% aka cask strength - Unpeated Style  Nose: Briney and sweet  Palate: creamy, light fruits  Finish: salty, cigar smoke  Quite a nice dram, this one might just follow me home yet, so I can get better acquainted with it. The cigar smoke finish is more of an after thought rather than being in your face. From when I used to smoke and I reached the time where the taste wasn't immediately there but upon exhaling there was that faint smokeyness, that's what I got. 90/100  Finally, the pièce de résistance of this trifecta! This last one is from BenRiach, aged in a bourbon barrel for 15 years, specifically barrel #44016 and it was bottled at a cask strength of 55%. I should mention that this one was exclusively bottled for Liquor Marts of Manitoba and only 208 bottles are available in total.  Nose: Werther's Original - hard butterscotch candies - very very rich on the butterscotch here  Palate: more of that delicious butterscotch, even more creamy than the previous Caol Ila 15, extremely rich  Finish: butter... like popcorn, drenched in butter, but none of the kernel, also some citrus once the butter makes way  Wow!! This one will definitely need to follow me home. This is a superb offering from BenRiach and if this is how all of their bottlings are, I might have to make a permanent home for their bottles. 94/100  edit: thanks /u/slanderousu for the correction!"

Maybe try a sherry matured whisky like glenfarclas (and contribute to the community review) or Aberlour. Or try something random like Clynelish 14? Many options. Also: check sidebar and maltmap.

This is what they have to say about it:   This special limited edition bottling is a valedictory farewell to the Vatted Malt, one delivered with honour and pride. This whisky is made from a marriage of fine, old single malt whiskies from Islay and Speyside distilleries. It combines intense aromas and flavours of dried fruits and maltiness underscored by a subtle, sweet smokiness, all robed in the revealing signs of whiskies of antiquity. Only 1,323 bottles have been released for sale.   Sounds pretty tasty! It's also 22% first-fill Sherry Butt, 78% American Oak Hogsheads, NCF and CS. Let's have a look...    Nose: initially powerful sherry. Subtle and barbecue smoke, some soy, crisp green apples, slight celery and twigs, gentle vanilla, stewed plums, heather honey   Very interesting mix of sherry and peat and youth and age. Quite fascinating. Certainly enjoyable, the honey and vanilla notes are particularly finessed.   Palate: vanilla, honey, dried fruit, milk chocolate, very very faint peat smoke, charred wood, some apple, brown sugar, sultanas, white grape, some old oaky toffee, slight soap, brandy, slightest hint of lactose   Lovely, less youth and peat here. Lots of distinguished aged notes.   Finish: dried fruit, chewy toffee peat. Slight coconut.    Ah man, this is good, but not as good as the nose suggested. I thought this was going to be a properly weird mix of youth and age, which it wasn't. And I love weird whisky. But it was still an excellent whisky, essentially an old peaty sherry dram.   92/100"

Nose: Astringently fruity; grapefruit, orange rind, and unlit matches. This is rather dense at this strength. Hydrogen-peroxide, like you’d smell in a hair salon. With some air it turns more winey. Raisins, dried figs, and… motor oil? With water, the sour-sherried sulfur impressions is amplified. This reminds me of an imaginary cask strength Glenmorangie Lasanta now.   Taste: Spicy-sweet. Full on juiciness! There is quite a journey ahead. Alternating between saw dust, nuts, licorice, and sweet toffee. Good stuff! This is rather old-school. Sultanas, candied grapes, and with water; tons of caramel. Honeyed almonds, and a touch of mentholated milk chocolate.  Finish: Medium. Pleasantly tannic, with vanilla and toffee.  Conclusion: A pleasant dram. Even undiluted, this is very drinkable. You’d have to like a touch of sulfur though. The parallels to the old 46% Lasanta are staggering, but this Tobermory exhibits a little more depth.  87/100"
Scotch,3dveg4,criollo_and_barley,7,Sun Jul 19 21:09:22 2015 UTC,"Thought I'd share what was an outstanding tasting that we had at our scotch club last night. While not all the drams were killer, it was a great chance to try some fairly elusive whiskies in one go. As to be expected my notes are brief.  1. Douglas Laing OMC Rosebank, 12 years @ 50% Cask #1564, bottled in 2005   Nose: Initially closed off. Floral and lemony. Palate: Grassy, some mineral notes, a bit astringent. Straightforward and basic  Finish: Astringency becomes more prominent.  Arbitrary grading: B- Overall: not a fan. Seems younger than the age on the bottle. These triple distilled malts are not for me.    2. AD Rattray Littlemill, 21 years @ 50.6% Cask #560, bottled in 2012   Nose: Waxy, light mint, big barley notes Palate: Honey, and oats. Reminded me very much of the Bruichladdich Bere Barley Finish: Spice/pepper makes a brief appearance, moreso with water  Arbitrary grading: B+ Overall: Many felt the nose didn’t fit with the palate. I particularly liked this one. Surprised the barley was so present after 21 years on wood.    3. Murray McDavid Gold Series St Magdalene, 18 years @ 58.3% Cask #392, bottled in 2006   Nose: Soy sauce, balsamic reduction, meaty notes. Truly nasty. Memories of Sam Adams Triple Bock for those of you who have had the distinct displeasure of drinking this ""beer"". Palate: Cloying, weird sourness, very tight. Stewed fruits.  Finish: Long and unfortunate Arbitrary grading: F Overall: A hot mess of a winesky from Mark Reynier & Co. This seemed to come out of a port pipe that had been infected and not rinsed. Gack.    4. Douglas Laing OMC Pittyvaich, 15 years @ 50% Cask #2390, bottled in 2006   Nose: Caramel, toffee Palate: Honey, caramel, wood spice, orange zest Finish: Spice develops. Arbitrary grading: B+ Overall: A very decent and enjoyable but not memorable whisky.    5. Douglas Laing OMC Banff, 32 years @ 47.8% Cask #3521, bottled in 2007   Nose: Candy floss, tropical fruit (papaya-y), earthy and oily, all around an amazing nose.  Palate: Musky, deep citrus notes/blood orange, oily, wood spice is perfectly integrated. A bit like a Chino or Stappi.  Finish: Just keeps slowly fading. Arbitrary grading: A+ Overall: One of the best examples of a well aged whisky I’ve had. I’d love a chance to buy this. Just awesome.   6. Gordon & MacPhail Dallas Dhu, 32 years @ 43%, bottled in 2012   Nose: Muskiness again – table mate swears this is what you get from long term storage in dunnage warehouse. Hard to pin down fruit. Very fleeting.  Palate: Delicate pears and apples. Creamy and vanilla. Unfortunately a bit overshadowed by the Banff. Finish: Doesn’t seem to develop much.  Arbitrary grading: B Overall: Should’ve been tasted earlier in the line up. It just seemed to be a very soft spirit that got lost in the Banff’s wake. Perhaps it wouldn't have suffered so much if it hadn't been cut to 43%.   7. Coopers Choice Glen Mhor, 27 years @ 46% Cask #1350, bottled in 2009   Nose: Minty, dried hay. Palate: Creamy, grassy, sour and bitter. Finish: Ho-hum Arbitrary grading: C+ Overall: I didn’t take to this one at all. Didn’t finish it.   8. Brora, 25 years @ 56.3%  2008 Release   Nose: Light peaty sourness, some not nice mustiness.  Palate: Waxy, salty, almonds, some non-descript fruits, a bit of sourness. Where’s the smoke? It took along time and some water for any smoke to show, and when it did it was a ghost of a whisper. The taste improved with time and water, but not markedly so.  Finish: Lengthy, but not very pleasant. Arbitrary grading: B Overall: As a table mate put it…”Nice dram, terrible Brora”. While not overly fair to compare, this is a shadow of a malt next to the 2014 release of the 35 year old. I imagine if I had more time with this, I’d like it better.    9. Douglas Laing OMC Port Ellen, 25 years @ 54.7% Cask #4176, bottled in 2008   Nose: Oily, ropy, tar, leafy, some lemon polish notes.  Palate: Smouldering campfire, great underlying sweetness – kind like marmalade. Very oily and resinous. Perfectly integrated. Peat and sweet.  Finish: Long, oily and smoky. Arbitrary grading: A+ Overall: This makes me understand the PE hype. Apparently when this was first released in town, it sold for $220. I’d pay that in a heartbeat.   10. Gordon & MacPhail Glen Albyn, 36 years @ 43%, bottled in 2012   Nose: Odd fruit syrup, some varnish/light acetone, orange, kind of similar to the 1970's G&W Centennial Rye that I had a while back. Palate: Orange zest/pithy, flinty, cardboard-y, a not so nice oiliness (cooking oil), toasted walnuts, a little bitter Finish: Bitterness creeps in.  Arbitrary grading: B- Overall: Again with the 43%. This is a profile that you really don't see much of. This was from a bottle that a mate at our table brought along to share as an aside.   What I learned: There's a reason some of these distilleries were shuttered, and it's not always an economic one. There is definitely an old school/rustic profile that doesn't exist anymore, and generally it's for the best. This tasting clearly shows this adage to be true; older is different, not necessarily better."

Scotch,3dvhuz,124876720,5,Sun Jul 19 21:37:51 2015 UTC,"Review #15: Octomore 6 Year Old Sauternes Cask (Rest & Be Thankful) - 64%  An extra-special review for number 15.  I treated myself to a sample of this excellent-looking independently-bottled (!) Octomore from the Rest & Be Thankful whisky company.  This was distilled in 2007 and matured for six years in a single Sauternes cask (no.16746, it says on the sample).  Sauternes is a French sweet wine from the Sauternais region of Bordeaux.  The grapes are afflicted with a particular kind of mold, known as ""noble rot"" (Botrytis cinerea) that, if the grapes are picked at the right time, can impart a particular sweetness to the wine.  Sauternes are known to be sweet, citric, and nutty, and the category includes Château D'Yquem – among the most famous (and best) châteaux in the world.   Not heard much about R&BT whisky company, to be honest.  Their only other product of note seems to be another Octomore, that one matured in a Rivesaltes cask.  Octomore, of course, needs no introduction – a ""super heavily peated"" whisky from the innovative/madcap Bruichladdich distillery.  So – how will smoke and Sauternes have married in the cask?   Incidentally, this is also my first Octomore and first Bruichladdich review.  Trembling with anticipation.  Slainte!            Setup: Glencairn, rested 20 mins, with and without water.  Drunk over a period of around 40 mins.   Color:  Deep sunset gold.    Nose: Light smoke.  A hint of medicinal notes.  A fresh, fruity scent – white grape pomace, crushed blackcurrant, plums.  Ribena fruit juice.  A little bit of spice -  nutmeg I think.  Garden scents – a forest after a rainstorm. Watering the whisky down massively enhances the flavor, damping the alcohol burn that the whisky's fearsome 64% gives it.  The overall picture is smoke, blackcurrant, and nutmeg and tonnes of them.  The flavor is huge.  It's not the most complex thing though.    Mouthfeel:  Oily and tremendous.  Palate:  Massive sugar and red fruit.  Plums, prunes, Medjool dates.  Some lemony bitterness creeps in too – very winey.  Wee bit of vanilla.  Almond.  More fruit flavors I can't adequately describe.  Some light smoke present throughout but rather hard to detect.  Definitely not the peat-reek of Port Charlotte or Ardbeg.    Finish: Blackcurrant.  Tannins.  A lingering smoky-salty heat that just goes on and on and on.  The fruit fights it all the way.  Little medicinal flourish right as it goes.    Overall: Gee-whiz! This is a cracking, if rather blunt, whisky.  It's certainly the best I've had to date, but it definitely has more in common with a sherry monster in the A'Bunadh style than the peat beast I was expecting.  It's not that complex either.  Still, a brilliant dram, and one that has me definitely hunting for more wine-matured whiskies.    92/100"

Ardbeg do things properly: 46%, NCF, and unchillfiltered.  So, what can you expect of this storied dram?    Review setup: Glencairn glass, rested 10 minutes, then tried with and without water.  Color: Evening sunlight.  And Ardbeg is 100% NCF and natural color, so it deserves the poetry.   Nose: Immediate powerful peat-reek.  This mellows a lot the longer you leave it in the glass, though.  Behind the peat is citrus, pepper, vanilla, orange peels, and a touch of brine.  A nicely rounded nose.  Mouthfeel: Thick and rich, which comes of this whisky being bottled at 46% and NCF.  Palate: Smoked herring, lemon juice, orange peel, and a hint of salt and vanilla.  Finish: A salty-smoky whack, fading into spicy oak.  Water tones down the smoke a lot, bringing forward the lighter fruit and sugary notes.    Overall: An impressive performance.  People often go on about the ""Apple-ification"" of Ardbeg, and some of the dizzying aray of recent releases: Supernova, Alligator, Auriverdes, etc, seem to have underwhelmed some people.  However, the 10 is in rude health.  Highly recommended - a new yardstick by which peaty whiskies will be judged.    85/100"

So, I had a mad little notion, and decided to make my own blended malt by mixing Old Pulteney 12 and Ardbeg 10.  Why?  Because I could, and those were the only whiskies I had.  Incidentally, this is the rarest blend in the world, because I control the supply. :P   Setup: Rested 20 mins in a Glencairn, whilst taking in high culture [cf, the South Park sixth season episode ""Simpsons Already Did It"")  Nose: The Ardbeg smoke is dominant, as I expected.  The parsley notes from the Pulteney are also there.  Mangoes and lemon.  Icing sugar.  What's weird as shit is that there's a quite pronounced new odor of burning clutch.   How odd.    Mouthfeel: Not that bad.  Thin cream.    Palate: Very sharp. Bitter lemon, mango, oak tannins, some Ardbeg smoke, clementines.  Burnt rubber.  Somewhat odd.  Not awful though.  Finish: Crippled, for whatever reason.  Not particularly nice when it lasted either.  Some oak and spices.  Overall: Not a bad exercise to do if you have the gear, but hardly a blockbusting dram.  78/100"
Scotch,3dtzr5,treydog9999,7,Sun Jul 19 13:24:16 2015 UTC,"Nice experiment. But when doing your own blending, 20 minute rest is not enough time for the 2 to mix and settle down. So its going to have more  of a layered flavor, like 1 whiskey on top of another rather than a true blend. I suggest you do the blend again but leave it aside for a few weeks and try again. Give it more time to marry up the flavors."

After about 10 minutes, the alcohol fades away and  I begin to get everything that I love about laphroaig. Strong ash, very earthy, sweet sherry notes poke through, they combine very well with the laphroaig flavour of peat in this one. Smoked salami, some salted caramel, some seaweed and more smoke. A really tasty combination of sweet & peaty notes here.   Taste: Initially strong peat with a salty note. I get a really charred note here, it has a medium body, sherry sweetness does come through but is no mach for the dominant smoke. The oak is present here, but not as distinct as the QC. Some tannins and bitterness.   Finish: Long & dry. There is a distinct Laphroaig note that I get on the finish of most good laphroaigs. Some people associate it with iodine but that is not what I get. It's a sort of chewy, rubbery, somewhat sweet medicinal note. Wet wood in a sauna, more earthy peat, a little fruit note that I can not quite determine appears.   Score: 88/100    This is a really good laphraoig. I have had some water left over from my previous 'farclas review, and even though it didn't really need it, I added some after the review. With water, the nose became less peaty and more of the sherry came through, the flavour was still very delicious, but the finish lacked a bit imho. Maybe if I tried it with water 1st, and neat afterwards,I would have found it quite different.   Sidenote rant I have had 3 signatory bottlings so far, and whilst the juice was really good, I am getting really sick and tired of my corks crumbling in to the bottle. Every. Single. One. Seriously, those IBs are not exactly cheap, and this really ruins the experience for me. Not to mention that the decanters are bullshit to pour from. Sort this shit out signatory."
Scotch,3dthwn,FromPaul,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:26:06 2015 UTC,"I have two first fill sherry Ib laphroaigs, love them lots, the refills not so much, the finish between the two changes the most,   Also thats a bit low % for a 17 year laphroaig, I have a 15 year at 60.2 and a 14 year at 60.8, could just be the cask has opened up afte the first lot of scotch was poured out."
Scotch,3dthwn,mapolo29,3,Sun Jul 19 12:32:33 2015 UTC,"55.6% doesn't seem low at all. That's seems in line with what I'd expect or even lower being 17 years old.  I'd argue that 60% is on the higher end for a 17.  You don't often see 17 or 18 year old scotch that is above 60% abv.  It does happen obviously, but after 17 years of evaporation you can see how it would drop below 60%. The angels take what they take.  I have a 17 year Laphroaig CS from Signatory that is 51.3% abv."
Scotch,3dthwn,HauntedKhan,2,Sun Jul 19 15:30:03 2015 UTC,"It also depends at what strength it was put in the cask. I have a 13 yo Arran that is CS at 55.6%.

Scotch,3dry3m,flexorhallucis,3,Sat Jul 18 21:48:05 2015 UTC,"Review #4 - Auchentoshan 'Cooper's Reserve' 14 Year Old  Information: 14 years old, matured in American Bourbon and Oloroso Sherry casks.  Auchentoshan triple-distills, versus the industry standard double-distillation: this means the raw spirit starts at a little over 80% versus 70-ish%; the effect this has is of course open to debate!  This edition is bottled at 46%, non-chill-filtered.  Travel retail exclusive.    Colour: between mahogany and rich honey  Nose: very sherry! Citrus, raisin, almond, and a hint of old leather.  Mouthfeel: smooth and oily? Pleasantly smooth at any rate.  Body: disarmingly gentle!  The bourbon notes come through, lots of berries and dried fruit.  Green tea.  Nuttiness (almonds?). Sweetness builds as it rolls across the tongue.  Smooth creamy notes develop.  On the way out, the tiniest hint of brine?  With water: opens up the sweetness into marshmallows and toasted chestnuts.  Finish: burnt sugar, crème brûlée, toasted almonds.  Very pleasant and long-lasting sweet aftertaste without being overwhelming.  Overall: the nose belied the gentleness of the body.  This was my first experience with Auchentoshan, I didn't go in with any expectations but got a very drinkable, everyday Lowland scotch.  Very easy-sipping, would make a nice dram to share.  Perhaps a few more years in the barrel would have added more depth to this whisky, but at any rate it's a sweet sherried offering that'll make for a nice sharer.  75/100"
Scotch,3dry3m,tintin777,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:48:09 2015 UTC,Never gotten a brine note from an Auchentoshan. What's the cost on this? I have never seen it.
Scotch,3ds8pv,wind_paedo,4,Sat Jul 18 23:28:03 2015 UTC,"NOSE: I really, really like the nose on this single malt. It smells very strongly of natural sugars at the surface, such as those from fruits. If I had to liken it to anything, I’d say apple juice with a touch of caramel. As I take deeper breaths and inhale more and more, in addition to feeling lightheaded, I begin to pick up subtle hints of something rougher, possibly smoke, but it’s well hidden.  TASTE: Quite a creamy texture on my tongue, with a slight tingling all around my mouth. Very smooth (no burn from the ethanol), it feels like a mixture of many soft flavours. Still very sweet at first, it is immediately complimented by something reminiscent of warm spices such as oak and nuts.  FINISH: A little burn at the back of my throat serves to remind me that this in fact a scotch and not a warm winter drink (not that I’m complaining). The sweetness dies away at this point and turns to a flavour that can only be described as “outdoors”. This, along with the spices, joins with a light smokiness. Very nice.  SCORE: Overall I like this dram. It’s not something that’s going to put hairs on your chest, but it will certainly warm you up. Quite smooth, you could easily drink a fair volume in one sitting. I picked up this bottle for just under £30, so the value for money is difficult to beat. To score this, I’d have to give it an 83/100. It’s very nice, but nothing too exciting."
Scotch,3ds8pv,cpfselfbuilt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:29:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review. It is definitely one of the gentler drams, especially well suited to newcomers to scotch (or when you just want something straightforward). I would describe the sweetness as ""honey"" flavoured."

Nose: Tangerine, malt, biscuits, salt, and just a hint of raisins.   Palate: Spice forward, but floral, with tangerines and general citrus, salty, with some wood flavors, and a hint of toffee leading to the finish.   Finish: Wood, biscuits, dry and citrus-y with some cocoa.   Notes: This tastes a bit hotter than 46%, love the tangerine but would not in a million years have guessed that this was lightly peated.   I feel like a bit of a fraud posting this like I don’t know what it is, /u/jmmdc gave me the heads up when I was confirming what sub to post this in (after doing my review).

Unlike the Macallan 12, I’m able to enjoy this one every time I drink it, now, looking at it I think the raspberry notes in the Macallan are what does it.

However, both Scapa and Highland Park are more northerly in real terms.  Pulteney are owned by Inver House.  Independent bottlings are rare.  This is their youngest age-stated expression, bourbon-cask matured and clocking in at 40%  Color: Gold bullion.  Achieved with color, though.  Nose: Parsley, butter, grapes, vanilla, seaweed, and herbs.  The saltiness promised by Old Pulteney's self-description ""the Maritime Malt"" isn't much in evidence, but it is there.  It's a very funny nose, I thought.  The bourbon casks have given a light, sweet flavor that wrestles with a more savory spirit.  If I could give a food equivalent, it's a bit like moules marinieres, the classic Franco-Belgian dish of mussels in a white wine sauce.  It's very nice, but a bit strange.  What do you guys get?   Mouthfeel: Reasonable hefty, nothing spectacular but nothing awful.  Palate: Very sweet.  Mango, strawberry, chillis, butter, oak, almonds.  Not bad, but very incongruous compared to the more savory nose.  No salt or peat at all really.   Finish: Very oaky, not a bad length, hints of the summer spices and herbs in the nose.    Overall: Weird.  Nice but weird.  The nose is nicely balanced between savory and sweet, but the flavors don't really go together.  Not one for water, it just dilutes the flavors.   Incidentally, saying a whisky tastes of moules marinieres is by far and away the most pretentious thing I've ever put in a review.  80/100"

A rather interesting and rare whisky today – a single grain from the Edinburgh based North British grain distillery.  This was bottled by those very famed and fine whisky merchants at WM Cadenhead.    North British is an interesting old distillery; it sits in Gorgie, right in the heart of Edinburgh, in a district that was formerly lousy with breweries and distillers, yet now only North British and the Caledonian beer brewery remain.  North British sits next to Tynecastle, home stadium of my local football team, the famous Heart of Midlothian.  When sitting in the stands, you can smell the distinctive aroma of the distillery – though fans seem divided if the smell is the barley in the mash tuns or the spent grains being mixed with waste from the continuous still.  They have no OBs, and even independent bottlings are fairly rare compared to the likes of Invergordon and Cameronbridge.  This is my first grain whisky review!  Color: Straw.  Very light.    Nose: Immediately this is a different beast to a single malt/blend.  Much more grainy and alcoholic on the nose – immediate hints of barley and rye.  Sticky toffee pudding.  Orange peel, strong citrus.  A lot of winter spices – nutmeg, mulled wine mix.  Sugar just beginning to caramelize.  A very faint hint of lime.  The nose changes a lot over time.  Apple drops eventually make an appearance.       Takes a wee while to open up.  Water is a must, but not too much!   Mouthfeel: Smooth and slick.  Impressive for the strength its at.    Palate: Starts beery and bitter.  Fruit and nuts develop.  A very strong barley-vegetal note develops towards the end.  Water brings out hints of spice and cream.  Good, but a bit of a let-down after that nose.    Finish: The barley stays, along with oak, spices, and a hint of sugar at the start.  Rye rounds it off.   Overall: It's a decent enough dram, but I don't think I was ready for this yet.  A 29-year old single grain is a bit much for someone as much of a beginner as I am.  I don't regret the purchase, I just think I'd have enjoyed it more later on.  This is definitely not a whisky for everyone – but then, we already knew that about single grain!  The strength is definitely in that wonderful nose.      86/100"

Scotch,3dqgsh,Rallerboy888,4,Sat Jul 18 14:44:22 2015 UTC,"Use a hot plate, no open flames.  The methanol is already gone possibly so you could get a nice few ounces of high proofed vodka.  Probably even legal in Denmark.  You hit DC yet?"
Scotch,3dqgsh,slanderousu,2,Sat Jul 18 14:46:50 2015 UTC,You can get a homemade pot still for not too much money.  Use boiling water on a hotpot under it.  Charcoal filtering before won't do anything. Chances are it has already been charcoal filtered numerous times.

Scotch,3dq466,Surprise_Sax,4,Sat Jul 18 10:20:00 2015 UTC,"As far as I am aware, GlenDronach do not chill-filter or artificially color their whiskies. Just one of the reasons to love them. I am a huge fanboy of the distillery, so unsurprisingly, the reviews will be positive. Yes, eventually I will get around to reviewing drams that I did not like so much. Anyways, on to the reviews, Sláinte!    GlenDronach 15yo Revival, 46%.  Nose: Sweet, orange marmelade, caramelised sugar, pears & cream, figs, dried apricots, the abundance of fruit here is just tops! Soft and refined.  Taste: Rich and sweet, youthful, beautifully balanced fruit, oak & sherry. Currants, dark chocolate, more apricot and raisins with a hint of spice.  Finish: Pleasant, very lingering, baked goods, delicious apricot danish.  Score: 90/100    GlenDronach 21yo Parliament, 48%.  Nose: Much heavier than the 15. Prunes, heavy toasted oak, musky damp wood, after about 10min it becomes extremely sweet, much much sweeter than 15 which I guess is to be expected from the PX influence.  Taste: Heavy plumbs, figs and oak. Oily & rich mouthfeel, candle-wax, spice, I would normally attribute the term meaty to heavy peat bombs, but it feels very appropriate for this dram.  Finish: Loads of oak, plumbs, more candle-wax with a touch of coffee. Very long and warming. After some time, the musty heaviness gives way to a gentle apricot note.  Score: 89/100    GlenDronach CS, Batch 3, 54.9%.  Nose: Sweet, youthful, a little harsher than the other two, to be expected due to CS & young spirit. Fresh, very sweet, peach ice tea, green grapes, extremely perfumed.  Taste: Canned cherries, dark chocolate, can feel alcohol in this one, but I find it more gentle than both A'bunadh & 'farclas 105. Some coffee & tannins. Less sweet than both 15 & 21 but that reduction in sweetness works in favour of the dram. Very subtle oak influence.  Finish: Medium dry, raisins, sweet perfume, dark chocolate again. After about 10 minutes I get that gentle apricot note again.  Score: 90/100    Conclusion: I have 1st tried the 15yo about 1.5 years ago, I bought a sample and immediately fell in love with this whisky. I found it quite difficult to score these as I have enjoyed them all, and they are all quite different (despite similar notes). The 21 is extremely indulgent, a great desert dram. The 15 I could have every day, it's much lighter yet still complex and extremely enjoyable. The CS is again very different to the other two, I would put it on the same level as A'bunadh (which I love). If you have never tried a GlenDronach, I would recommend starting with a 15. I am yet to try the 12yo, and have tried the 18 which I enjoyed less than the 15."

Scotch,3dpu4c,treydog9999,5,Sat Jul 18 07:30:27 2015 UTC,"Hello Scotchit, this is my 4th review and I am sticking to more scotches from the beginners lists. I have been tasting quite a lot at a local shop in BeiJing and its been really fun. I was excited to taste this one because it is the ""most popular single malt"" bought by Scottish people. Or something like that. Honestly, still consider myself a beginner but have started falling in love with whisky and understanding each ones taste profile. So without further ado.    Glenmorangie 10 Year old The Original   40% ABV 700 ml  Tasted in a Copita Nosing glass, neat then with water.   Appearance: Amber - 1. Medium legs Nose: Subtle wood, vanilla fruit, red fruit (apple?), sweet wood, lemon. w/ water more woody citrus, and sweet vanilla starts to come out.  Taste: slightly honey, faint fruit, citrus, light mouthfeel, slightly spiced. w/ water sour citris and spicier with some more wood coming through. Finish: Slight woody finish that is very mild. w/ water spicy wood. Conclusion: Definitely a ""beginner"" single malt. Nothing stands out that can offend you, but also nothing really engages you. There were some flavors, mostly sweet and woody flavors. They are all very subdued and not overwhelming. Honestly in my mind, this is extremely boring. Bordering on forgettable. I am glad I tried this at a shop as opposed to buying a bottle straight up based on the beginner list. For people who like more sweeter and subtle notes this is for you.  Score: 79/100"
Scotch,3dp50m,dlofx,3,Sat Jul 18 02:44:59 2015 UTC,"Info: 48.7%; 97.4 Proof    Color: Mahogony    Nose: Fresh berries, ripe fruit, subtle campfire smoke, salt, dates, grape, sugary candies, toasted fennel.     Taste: While new to reviewing scotch, I have certainly have had my fair share at this point. This is striking with how fruity it comes off. The berries, fruity, and sugary notes are all here. To say it is pleasant is a complete understatement. Coming from my previous experience with American Whisky, there is a subtle spice here, just not like you would find in an overbearing rye whisky or high rye bourbon mashbill. As I take sips, I get more and more confused with the flavors. This sucker is complex and really enjoyable.    Finish: For a relatively low proof, the finish does not upset. It hits the back of the tonsils with a slight bitter, red hots candy feel. It dries my palate just enough to want another sip.     Overall:  I really enjoyed this pour and it is a tragedy I don’t own the bottle. If I had to knock it somewhere, it would be the mouthfeel. It just felt rather thin and uninspiring there for some reason. Outside of that, the whisky was fantastic.  It is well balanced, complex and highly drinkable. With knowing very little about this particular pour, I would guess that it spent some time finishing in a wine barrel at some point. It just has a profound grape like flavor that I liken to my experience with MWND. I came out blazing with 2012 George T. Stagg and gave it my highest mark to date in /r/bourbon on my very first review. It appears I may be doomed to that cycle here. The only scotch I have had that I would rate higher at this point is Benrinnes 23.  What more could you really ask for for a first review? This was splendid.  A special thanks to /u/hawki84 for this fantastic pour!     95/100"

Scotch,3dnnq9,thatfamousgrouse,2,Sat Jul 18 01:31:39 2015 UTC,"Review #42:  Ledaig 10, aka Cousin of Butthole Whisky  You may recall what I had to say about Tobermory 10.  Well, here’s Tobermory 10’s heavily peated cousin.  $60 / 750 ml / 46.3%  Nose:  Sharp English cheddar, sea spray, garlic and onions cooking in olive oil, minerals, dark chocolate, gentle iodine and flowers.  There’s also another note in here that I can’t readily identify – the marketing spiel on the box says creosote, but I’ve never been anywhere near that in my life, so I can’t say if that’s accurate.  A very enticing nose, very salty.  Palate:  Medium thickness, medium oiliness.  Sweet liquorice, creamy dark chocolate, sea salt, thick toffee, burning heather, bacon jam, black coffee.  Delicious.  Slightly warm, but not as warm as I’d expect at this ABV.  Finish:  Medium length, warming, drying.  Eucalyptus, mint, cloves, bittersweet oak.  The Verdict:  I really like this whisky.  I rated the Tobermory 10 at 92.5/100, which was definitely overly generous, but I like this more being a peat fan and all.  The Tobermory spirit is very noticeable running in the background with the herbal, mineral, and sweet flavors, while the peat brings out some delicious savory additions.  A very good whisky, and one that I would recommend if you find yourself struggling to enjoy peat.  I'm excited that they're going to release an OB 18-year Ledaig.  Score: 87.5/100"

Scotch,3do5lk,kinohead,3,Fri Jul 17 21:31:58 2015 UTC,"Bunnahabhain Ceòbanach  So, here we have a un-chillfiltered, natural colour, 46.3% abv, peated Bunnahabhain presented in an elegant yet simple bottle.  Very promising.  Strangely lacking a age statement, the fine print on the bottle and tube inform us that the spirit has been aged for ""over ten years"" in ex-bourbon casks.  One would think that this would yield a more obvious age statement on the bottle and has me wondering if perhaps there is younger juice in here and one could kind of, sort of, technically put younger whisky and it wouldn't contradict the wording on the back.  I'm a sucker for peat and enjoy the Bunnahabhain 12, so how does this fair?  Colour: Yellow and Gold.  Nose: Peat, smoke, seaweed, sea mud, brine, flowers, dark honey, lemon zest, lime, molasses, mint, vanilla, mushrooms, fresh air, mint cinnamon, jagermeister, bread, vanilla ice-cream, cream, spray cleaner, burnt wood. Complex.  Palate: Peat, honey, smoke, rosemary, mushrooms, earth, toffee, cotton candy, corn syrup, molasses, cream.  Finish: Smoke, peat, vanilla, honey, burnt matches.   Very nice.  Chewy, creamy, bold.  If you associate the 12 year old with a unique, earthy, mushroom-like quality, you can find those elements here, although less prominent.   88/100  Other Bunnahabhain Reviews:  Bunnahabhain 12 - 87/100   Bunnahabhain 18 - 83/100"

Scotch,3dngp2,j4ni,3,Fri Jul 17 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"Hey there Scotchit! I'm hurrying through my Beginner's List Reviews since I got a little bored of it, mostly because of the malts. It's still fun to review them and it gets easier to recognize different flavors constantly and reproducible or at least a little more constantly :) By chance this was part of a round of sweet to very sweet malts I reviewed the last weeks (Dalwhinnie, the Bunna, aCnoc, Chiva's, Glenmo Tusail,...still have to transfer them from my little black book to reddit...). Macallan is a big name with quite a reputation even though around here it doesn't get that much love as in the “real world” where millions of none scotchit people buy tons of Macallan without letting us know...anyhow here's number six of my mini-series of reviews of malts from the Beginner's list. The other are to be found here:  MBLAK #1: Glenfarclas 12 including an explanation  MBLAK #2: Glenfiddich 12  MBLAK #3:  Glenmorangie The Original  MBLAK #4:  Dalwhinnnie 15  MBLAK #5:  Bunnahabhain 12  Thoughts on reviews are to be found here  TL;DR: Quick facts:  10 years old - 40% - ≈ 77€ in Germany  Nose: Honey or maybe more like brown sugar and malt both very prominent, there are some hints of fruits in the back however not very present and covered in a pile of sweet oaky malt (well who would've thought considering that name...)  Palate: initial honeysweetness almost like artificial sweetner, then comes oaky vanilla and malt, very much inline with nose and very, well, smooth in a way that there are no corners or things that stood out. A very monolithic taste so to say. Maybe it's just me and I can't stand another super sweet malt, but I would call this one boring...not bad, very well made indeed but too round and too sweet for me  Finish: middle long, the sweetnes fades into a mild peppery taste which is actually pretty nice! The finish is the best part of this malt for me.  Conclusion: I was quite shocked when I looked up the price of a whole bottle. I know that everyone is talking about their steep prices but boy, 77 Euros woah!...if I would take that into the score it would be significantly lower! When I look at the word cloud in the Beginner's list there are some flavors mentioned (though not that big) that I didn't get with the Macallan Fine Oak 10, especially the fruit notes where hidden for me. It was all it says on the label: Sweet, Malt, Oak. Then a refreshing peppery finish. Inoffensive one could say. Other may say boring. I'm somewhere inbetween. But for me it's definetly not worth to pay 77 Euros for it...you and the world may disagree but that's OK for me.  Would I buy it again?: At that price?! No way!  Score: 77/100 okeyish, I liked the Bunna 12 far more, maybe I was a little too critical with  the Bunna. Again, I can see why this is popular with people, but for me it's a little to edgeless.    Quick-Info on the scores: To give you an idea what those numbers mean to me I added the table below. I kept the /100 though to keep it comparable and reviewbotable. Everything below 73 isn't really my type of Scotch even though I accept that my 68 could be your 93 and vice versa...     100 - 96 95 – 87 86 – 78 78 - 73    Wow! Holy mother of God! Really, really good! Good! Ok!    The full story behind the dram (if you've got the time for that...) There's none to be honest, it's a big name, it's on the list, I drank it and it's not made for me. I'm very interested in the rest of the range though, if it wasn't for the price! So, if any European swappers read this, I'm up for swapping for Macallans! :)"

I would definitely recommend giving this whisky time, as I was not really as impressed the moment I opened it.  Price: US ~$90 per 1L   Nose: Very complex, the best thing about this whisky is its nose. Overwhelming honey/caramel/vanilla, accompanied by red orange and dried fruit/raisins, touch of citrus/green apple, tobacco leaf, salt, leather, floral perfume.  Taste: Very rich, but not complex palate with just a few overwhelming tastes of honey/vanilla, pepper spice, a touch of grapefruit/bitterness, salt and some citrus. Some dryness in the development, but not as much as during the finish.  Finish: Finish is long and dry, but again not as complex as the nose. More grapefruit bitterness, lots of spice, some caramel and vanilla are still present. Some sourness develops as well.  Verdict: I had left this whisky on the side for a couple of months and was surprised how time in the bottle had helped it develop. A lovely dram, it definitely has the potential to be something extraordinary had it been bottled at 46% and not chill filtered as Ralfy suggested. I should try the normal 43% bottling, but even at 40% I am taken by surprise. I like it.  Score: 88"

Port Charlotte 7 means this is the 7 year old version of Bruichladdich's Port Charlotte Series.       Nose: Peat, Burnt Oak, Burnt Sugar, Tequila/Mezcal Overtones, Lemon Rind, Loads of Pepper, Mango, Vanilla  The nose starts off a smoky mezcal with a twist of lemon, then moves to a fruited cream.     Palate: Intense and Smoky Peat, Vanilla Icing, Salty Brine, Mezcal  The first thing I noticed was the incredibly creamy mouthfeel.  Waves of peat, vanilla and mezcal.  I found it difficult to pick out minutiae in the midst of the storm.  This is a fairly young spirit, very brash.     Finish: Incredibly long briny salted peat, something bitter  Will be tasting peat tomorrow.  It took me a while but eventually I noticed a very off-note in the finish that just wouldn't go away.  Unpleasantly bitter and it just stays there with the finish the whole time.     Overall:  I have been getting more into the tequila and mezcal flavors recently but I like scotch in my scotch.  That said, this reminds me a lot of my 5 year Caol Ila in its brashness and its proof.  Peat heads will love it.  PPM's seem pretty high.

We're ending with an oldy (but not the oldest) and a goody, Talisker 30 (2011 release).  And again I get mixed up and buy the 'wrong dram'. This was suppose to be the 2009 version, and I ended up missing out on the last of the drams. The difference between them is the 2009 is Cask Strength, and this one is 'Talisker strength'.  Which isn't so bad. I mean, it's not like they lowered it down to 43% or even 40%. Then it wouldn't even be worth it.  None the less, this is still something very interesting. It's 30 years on the Isle of Skye saw lots of Angel's Share fly away into the... is it a sea? Yeah, let's say a sea. That sounds right.  And it's 1 year older than me. Well, it was put in the cask a year before I was born, more like it. So that's pretty cool. And completely ex-Bourbon casks too.  I know I'm somewhat disappointed after finding out the 2009 was Cask Strength, however this may still be good. So let's see how it tastes, shall we?  Price: N/A at the LCBO  Region: Island  Abv: 45.8%  Colour: 5Y 6/8  Nose: Pear, smoke, floral, raspberry, grapefruit, plum, Sprite, nectarine, vanilla pudding, butterscotch  There's a fruity/floral/Bed, Bath, and Beyond note to this one that really comes forward. And it's all over the place too. Normally I'd only write one or two fruits (or three), and then say ""Well, I'm just naming fruit now"", however this is distinct and nice.  Quite pungent too. Knocks your nose around quite a bit. Not overly sweet. It's balanced.  Taste: Peat, butter, walnut, salty pretzels or peanuts (couldn't figure it out), marzipan, strawberry/Framboise, melon, dry  Very dry as time goes on. And the brine has gone from ""hmm, pickles"" to more so ""hmm, peanuts/pretzels/baseball"", though doesn't quite hit that reminding me of baseball memory note.  Almost though. Very close.  Finish: Almond, bread dough, birch sap, sulphur, brine, dill, coffee cake, cumin, ginger-ale, cinnamon  It finishes like an Irish whiskey. Which is super weird. And there's sulphur, however it's not a bad amount, just a light amount. Really odd, dry, spicey, earthy, thing.  Conclusion: This is a nice dram. Is it worth the extra money over the 25? Debatable. It's slightly better. The finish is different and interesting. It's not quite there. Maybe if it was WAY better, or somewhat better.  But I'm splitting hairs. It should be Cask Strength, and it isn't. Maybe if it was, I wouldn't have a chance to have any. Maybe I would. It is complex, balanced, earthy/briney/fruit thing that I'm glad to have.

Not the usual branded large-ish jug, but small, pottery jugs that had no handle and were shaped to fit nicely in your hand. Like this: http://rupertblamire.com/products/the-stewart-whisky-water-jug  They just seemed so right with the whiskies, and so unique."

Scotch,3do1xp,devilsadvocate23,3,Sat Jul 18 11:03:00 2015 UTC,I know what you're looking for. I assumed you were looking to give someone a gift. It appears however that you may be researching one of those articles that lead the people in my life to buy me whisky related gifts instead of whisky. I hope you get paid for your article but the company goes out of business before it's published.
Scotch,3do1xp,MartijnR,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:21:44 2015 UTC,"Well aren't you charming!   I was actually looking to get something for a friend who recently got engaged. His fiancee very gently asked that we hold off on giving bottles for a little while as their new new home is still being unpacked and they are having trouble finding a place for his very extensive bottle collection to live. I considered glasses, but that didn't feel as thoughtful and I was hoping to get him something that would last longer than a bottle.  Thanks for your kind and supportive words and your willingness to not be a dick to someone with a simple question!"
Scotch,3do1xp,Neversafeforlife,3,Sat Jul 18 14:52:30 2015 UTC,"Nice language and attitude. I was legitimately trying to answer your question. Many people when buying gifts think....he likes whiskey. I'll get him something whiskey related.....As a whisky drinker, I wanted to tell you that it isn't the best idea to do that. As someone who has a box somewhere filled with whiskey stones, ice ballers, molds to make shot glasses out of ice and such I thought it would be helpful to tell you that most whiskey drinkers would prefer whisky to that stuff.  Now that you have provided more information, which I totally believe, if his bottle collection is extensive he certainly has the means to buy any whiskey related item he needs. My advice would now be buy him a non-whiskey related gift or a gift certificate to a local liquor store.  I'm not sure why you took such an attitude with what I wrote. I was expressly careful to not wish you ill. I expressly indicated I hoped you got paid for your article....my hope was that it wouldn't get out there to influence people to buy whiskey drinkers trinkets, and other garbage they don't want and won't use."

Scotch,3dkzu5,muaddib99,6,Fri Jul 17 03:03:37 2015 UTC,"so at the beginning of this year I was at about 50 reviews and I got this 28yr old beauty from /u/Jolarbear. I considered drinking and reviewing it on my birthday, but decided instead to set a goal of hitting 100 reviews before my 29th birthday and making this one #100. very soon I discovered I was well ahead of schedule, so i changed the goal to finish the 100th by the time I got married in August. then i found i was ahead of the pace again and decided to aim for 100 before the sale of my first house closes on July 21.  as you can see from the picture, everything is packed up and i'm ready to leave this place! but before i leave i'm going to review the first scotch i've had that's as old as I am: Bunnahabhain 28 Cask Strength from Signatory, distilled in 1978, bottled 2006. Aged in Sherry Butts, cask 2853. Received this in a swap with /u/Jolarbear in person in the lobby of the condo building i'm moving to in a couple of days!   Bunnhabhain 28 Signatory Cask Strength - 50.8% ABV  Appearance:  deep brown-orange.  Even held up to the light it's a light brown colour. Phat legs (ph intentional). Looks thick and viscous.   Nose: massive sherry and dark rich fruit. Sugar, toffee, sea water, molasses, almonds, candied apples, grapes  Taste: this is incredible… chocolate, toffee, almonds, butterscotch, dark berries, pipe tobacco, almost a rye-like spiciness, dark dry red wine. A bit of smoke and some saltiness as well. really thick mouthfeel. Runs a wee bit hot so I added a splash of distilled water, after which i get some honey and caramel, along with more chocolate nougat.    Finish: sweet and malty heat linger for minutes. Fades to fruit and a tony bit of smoke.   Rating: 93/100  might be the nostalgia for my house, or the hitting 100 reviews talking, but I'm scoring this among some of the best I've ever had. It's a beautiful combination of fruit and Islay saltiness and sits with you forever. It's as old as I am, and gorramit, I respect this dram."

Scotch,3dkv23,muaddib99,4,Fri Jul 17 02:20:14 2015 UTC,"so my house closes in a couple of days, everything is packed up (as you can see from the piles in the background), I don’t have a couch or bed to sleep on tonight, and I realized I need to post 4 more reviews to hit my goal of 100 before the sale closes! Fortunatley, I have an Ardbeg review already in hand thanks to the tasting tower at the LCBO, and i have 2 more Ardbegs unreviewed at home. so below is an Ardbeg triple review to get me to 99.     First up is the classic: Uigeadail. I got this one in a bottle swap with /u/kilrathi for a bottle of FR125. had i known then what i know now, i probably wouldn't have swapped for just even dollar cost, but i was glad to help out another redditor. this bottle is $175 here in Ontario, so i felt like it was a good deal.  Ardbeg Uigeadail - 54.2% ABV  Appearance:  dark orange gold. Are these uncoloured? Thick oozing legs.   Nose: great hit of peat up front, iodine, lots of brine, some floral notes too. dried fruit. Smoke too.  Taste: tons of smoke and charcoal. Ashy and delicious. Peaty bog. Smoked meats. Really thick and oily mouthfeel. I don't get the same bright red fruit flavours from sherried drams that I normally find. This is more figgy and pruney. Nice offset to the ashy peat though. EDIT: after tasting the Ardbog, this definitely is way more sweet and also more smoky. far more depth than Ardbog.   Finish: smoky with some background sweetness. Boggy peat lingers a long time.   Rating: 92/100  this is great and I'm sad I don’t have the 10 year the compare it to anymore which I reviewed way back in whisky review #1! . This seems like a small step up… more breadth but less depth in some ways. really really nice.     next up is a dram I got in a swap with /u/TOModera as part of the secret santa swap this past Christmas. Excited to try another from this delicious distillery.  Ardbeg Ardbog - 52.1% ABV  Appearance:  very similar to Uig. Dark and rich looking. Thinner legs than Uig.   Nose: more iodine, less smoke than uig. Pretty sweet smelling actually.   Taste: again a lot less smoke, a ton more iodine and peat. It really is quite swampy too. there are some crazy sweet notes I just can't place. Some kind of candy.   Finish: holy medicinal batman!   Rating: 91/100  this is a really nice dram but it's got much less depth than Uigeadail. I do love the heavy medicinal qualities so I'm scoring it highly, but it's not quite as good as some other Ardbegs I've had.     the third is Perpetuum. I had this at the Summerhill LCBO tasting bar. Having seen the mixed reviews I thought I'd give it a shot and see how it measures up, as I'd been building an Ardbeg list of reviews to post leading up to the big 100. let's see how it is.   Ardbeg Perpetuum - 47.4% ABV  Appearance:  pale straw  Nose: sweet peat, some smoke   Taste: smoky, light peat… very light actually. Ashy.  Finish: finish is warm and smoky….surprise surprise.  Rating: 80/100  this is rather 1-dimensional. Some smoke, mild peat and that's about it. I'm disappointed and can see why others were as well. glad it only cost me $3 for a sample. I wouldn't buy this, particularly at LCBO prices ($187). not a great release to celebrate 200 years.     sadly this series had diminishing returns :( but on the bright side, i drank a ton of peat and it really was delicious! ardbeg, you were with me at review #1 and now you're with me at review #99. you may be releasing some mediocre limited editions lately, but i still love you xoxo  Previous Ardbeg Reviews:   Ardbeg 10 Ardbeg Corryvrecken Ardbeg 9 Provenance"
Scotch,3dkv23,Kilrathi,3,Fri Jul 17 02:28:06 2015 UTC,"A year plus later, I want to say thanks for the swap. It was my first here on Scotchswap and I guess the secondary market has moved in ways I don't think we could have guessed but I really appreciate the FR and am glad you like the Uig - it's great stuff. You were the first of many people who showed just what a great community we have here (and not the last of quick handoffs of whisky bottles in random places either).  I really appreciate it and definitely owe you one... If you're ever in the States let me know and if I make it back up north, I'll buy you a drink or many!  Or least bring some more Ardbeg!"

Scotch,3dl7mb,Ethanized,3,Fri Jul 17 04:16:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you, /u/nonmagnetic for sending me this awesome Bruichladdich expression!  Per the usual, the sample was tasted blind initially, with notes in italics added during the second (revealed) tasting if I found anything important.     Bruichladdich Black Art 3.1 22yr – 48.7%    Category Notes    Setup: Neat, INAO, rested 20 minutes. Subsequent tasting was in a Glencairn.   Color: Tawny   Nose: Beautifully rich and full of dark fruit. Layered, starting with a wisp of oak which fades into sherry, and moves to fig jam. I pick up just a touch of that familiar Bruichladdich aroma, and this point I’m guessing it’s Black Art. Hey, look at that, I got one right! The dark, dried, fruit are so intense here… it’s like I’m smelling raisin-poppy seed cake, not a whisky. 28/30   Taste: A sherry-like flavor hits first, the oak and figs follow; very flavorful. The slightly bitter poppy helps offset the sweet raisins. 28/30   Body: Nice mouthfeel, but with a surprising amount of heat. Solid body, not too light nor too heavy. The heat is more mellow the second time around. 8/10   Finish: Very warm and fruity; lingers a minute, with the warmth fading before the flavors. Flavors are well-balanced, but it’s still a touch on the sweet side. 27/30   Score: 91/100   Value: 3/5 @ $250 for 750ml (5 = must buy; 4 = good buy; 3 = priced right; 2 = overpriced; 1 = avoid).       Average score to date: 83     There’s a lot going on with this whisky – the flavors are opulent, bordering on overwhelming. The sugary Bruichladdich vein runs through Black Art like the other non-peated varietals, but it’s balanced out by the time spent in oak. All that said, it loses points for me on the finish, which is just a tinge too sweet. The poppy helps, but it’s overwhelmed by the raisins in the end. I think this is currently the third-best Bruichladdich I’ve tasted, which is actually high praise, considering my proclivity for the Octomores."

William Grant & Sons Speyside, Dufftown First maturation in whisky oak – ie, bourbon casks. Most likely chillfiltered and E150 added.    Setup: Rested 15 minutes IN a brandy snifter.  Tasted once, then again with water 15 minutes on.   Color: A middling gold.  Nose: White fruit, vanilla, white pepper, grapes, sugar.  Chocolate.  A hint of cherries and stewed fruit.  A barely discernable smoke, so much so that I wonder if I'm imagining it.  Water brings forward a lovely golden syrup note.     Mouthfeel:  Reasonable thickness, a little vinegary.    Palate: Liquorice, light fruit, chalk, currants, and lots of spice.  Enhanced by water.       Finish: Spicy, the currants are back.

Scotch,3dl2xq,The_PharmASSIST,3,Fri Jul 17 03:32:08 2015 UTC,"For my first Scotch I have ever tried from Campbeltown, I am sampling Springbank 10 Year.  It was given to me as a gift from one of my generous co-workers who purchased a 5-bottle sampler when he visited Scotland for me.   Notes: Gift (part of 5 pack of 5cl bottle gift pack), 46% ABV, very thin in appearance.  Legs are very thin and does not cling much to the Glencairn glass.  No water added. Color: Light straw Nose:  Immediate wood, oak, followed by pear and light fruit scents.  The alcohol is easily smelled in this one but it not overpowering.  Noticed some pepper on a second whiff. Taste: Surprisingly mild given the stronger nose.  The initial hit is pretty mild followed by short apple and pear, and then alcohol burn.  I added a few drops of water after this to lighten it a bit.  A second sip yielded a bit more fruit but this time also tasted a bit like 'grass' for lack of a better word.  It has a bit of a salt/mineral taste that reminds me of Talisker 10 to an extent. Finish:  The oak/cask seems to dominate here for me.  The fruity bits are drowned out by woody taste.  Mineral hints seem to complete the finish.  After sitting for a few minutes, I had a mild resurgance of the apple sneaking back to complete the finish.  The late mouthfeel is also 'waxy' in terms of texture.   Overall not a bad dram (especially as a gift!).  I can see how this is regarded a bit more of a mild dram.  Coming from an Islay guy, this was an enjoyable dram, but more mild than my personal taste.  I feel that the taste was a bit 'flat' in cases where I feel that there were a couple periods which didn't elicit much at all in terms of taste, followed by something else.  The most surprising bit was the mineral taste that I didn't expect.  I enjoy this kind of flavoring typically only from Island and Islay scotch.  It has a prescence here, but is relatively muted compared to its aformentioned peers.  Unfortunately I feel this falls somewhere 'in the middle' of many other drams.  It has hints of some of the island characteristics and the fruitiness of speysides and highland scotch, but is pretty mild at all of them.  It is far from a bad dram, but its flavors are too mild overall to excite me.  78/100"
Scotch,3dkomg,Suck_It_Trebek,4,Fri Jul 17 01:23:16 2015 UTC,"Review #41:  Macallan 18  Well, this 375 ml bottle was on sale for $90, and I sure as hell wasn’t going to shell out $179 pre-tax on an 18-year old whisky that’s colored out the ass, chillfiltered, and watered down to 43%.  But for $90?  I’ve spent more on whisky.  I enjoy the 12-year and the Duncan Taylor CS bourbon bottle I have is delish, so I figured it’s worth it to try.  $90 / 375 ml / 43%  Nose:  Brown sugar in melted butter, oloroso funk, molasses, Guyana rum, bananas flambéed in cognac, cinnamon.  Pretty good nose for 43%.  Palate:  Thin, slightly oily, slightly silky.  Brown sugar, melted butter, hand whipped cream, wildflowers, chocolate oranges.  Unusually hot for 43%.  Finish: Medium length, hot.  The chocolate oranges combine with some cognac-grape and cinnamon.  The Verdict:  Well it’s good, but not great.  It has more complexity than the 12-year, but not that much.  It’s well-balanced, and well-integrated, but there’s not nearly enough complexity and the flavors aren’t pronounced enough to merit the price.  Glenlivet 18 is very similar to me, albeit with a more intense floral note on the nose that isn’t here, as well as a greater fruit presence on the palate.  I can get that for $75 a bottle, which is a much better buy in my opinion.  The Macallan 18 is superior in flavor, but not $140 superior.    Aside from the whisky itself, it’s the fucking height of douchebaggery that Macallan label their whiskies as Highland, despite being smack in the middle of Speyside, to try to latch onto the socio-cultural tradition of the Scottish Highlands being an exclusive area of recreation for the ultra-wealthy.  I normally grade in multiples of 2.5, with the idea being that an 85/100 whisky is 82.5 on a bad day, and 87.5 on a good one, but I can’t bring myself to give this whisky that much leeway – it’s Macallan 12+1.  Score: 83.5/100   Edit: It appears Macallan doesn't color their whisky, but that seems the least of the offenses they commit against their whisky"
Scotch,3dkomg,slanderousu,2,Fri Jul 17 01:24:46 2015 UTC,But any Speyside distillery can legitimately claim they are a Highland distillery... because they are.

Scotch,3dkomg,TheWhiskeyKid,2,Fri Jul 17 02:42:34 2015 UTC,"Tain is across the Moray Firth from Speyside.  Geography aside, I haven't tried enough Glenmorangie to asses their whisky.  I really didn't like The Original 10-year, and I had the Quinta Ruban in a tumbler with a BBQ rib rack, so I can't really make a detailed judgement about that particular juice, but I liked it"
Scotch,3dkomg,slanderousu,2,Fri Jul 17 02:45:16 2015 UTC,"Was just looking it up, I'm way off.  There is at least one very big one that does it other than Macallan, I'm blanking on it though.

Scotch,3dksjb,redascot,4,Fri Jul 17 01:58:16 2015 UTC,"Edradour 10  ABV: 43%  Price: $49.99 at Costco(!)  Color: Black Tea, Amber  Nose: Rich, thick molasses hits the nose with force. Ginger, rum raisin, and sticky, sugary preserves all come through.  Body: Fairly thick, but at 43%, they run fairly quickly.  Palate: Ginger syrup, fruit juice, cashew butter. Molasses continues to come through.   Finish: Long and warm, but not the smoothest. It has a rather bitter note, like putting straight Angostura aromatic on the tongue. The timeline goes Oil -> Sweet Syrup -> Bitters.  Conclusion: Definitely worth the Costco price point of $50. It's not an easy whisky to come by, in my experience, so I jumped on it. The molasses tones are very powerful, and apart from the finish, the combination of sweet, sticky, and bitter is rather unique. I'll cherish this bottle, and I might be back for more.  Score: 82/100. (I'm trying to avoid score inflation as I get my review repertoire going. 82 is still damn good in my book.)  Thanks for reading."

Scotch,3dk24g,horizoning,2,Thu Jul 16 22:14:59 2015 UTC,"Price: $67. Pretty good for a 53.6% NCF, no color-added cask strength whisky.  Nose: Malt, vanilla, toffee, oatmeal, stewed apples, cake, doughnut, brine. Water brings out unripe bananas.  Taste: Malt, oak, toffee, ginger, bread, honey, apricots, leather, doughnut, well-hidden sherry, salt. Water brings out cream.  Finish: Hot, spicy, and long. Woodchips, ginger, spice cake, stewed apple, cocoa, tobacco. Water enhances the tobacco, while smoothing out the edges of the heat.  Overall: This resembles a less fruity, better balanced Glenlivet Nadurra 16. Plenty of bourbon influence, with just a tiny bit sherry behind it all. There's a lot going on behind the scenes here, but general malt tends to drown it all out without a adding some water. Not quite the summer whisky you may be thinking it is - at least before cooling it down some.  86/100: As far as price and quality goes, this is probably the best primarily-bourbon influenced malt you're going to find on the market. And even better, it can take a bit of ice if you want to give yourself a summer whisky that isn't called bourbon."
Scotch,3dk24g,mapolo29,2,Thu Jul 16 22:15:05 2015 UTC,"It's my understanding that batch 2 has quite a bit of sherry cask  ( 17 first fill and 4 refill) influence while newer batches are more bourbon influenced with the sherry playing a supporting role.  It doesn't really mention the amount of time it may have spent in bourbon casks so it's hard to say, but I do recall Batch 2 having a noticeable sherry influence.  Release 3 is comprised of 31 bourbon barrels, 5 first fill sherry and 13 second fill so it seems to be more heavily bourbon influenced than batch 2.  Release 4 they are vague only saying its a combo of all 3, but from what I hear it's heavier on bourbon.  https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/arran/arran-12-year-old-cask-strength-batch-2-whisky/#!/product/"

Scotch,3djl16,j4ni,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:08:21 2015 UTC,"Had to delete the first try as I managed to get the title wrong...nice one!...anyway here we go: Hey there Scotchit! Since the temperatures dropped (and risen again) in good ole Germany I found the time to type some of my reviews. This is the Bunnahabhain 12 and part of my Beginner's List Review series where I try to use the Beginner's list to create my own aroma kit. How this works (not so sure about that either maybe I should reread/rethink why or how I do this?) and what I've reviewed so far is to be found here:  MBLAK #1: Glenfarclas 12 including an explanation  MBLAK #2: Glenfiddich 12  MBLAK #3:  Glenmorangie The Original  MBLAK #4: Dalwhinnie 15  Thoughts on reviews are to be found here  TL;DR: Quick facts:  12 years old – 46,3% - ≈ 42 € in Germany – NCF and Natural Colour (Nice!)  Nose: The first time I had this I jotted down „dusty old carpets but in a nice way, not too dry but not to wet either”, on later visits it looked more serious:  Sherry?, a grassy note, honey, caramel, cereal notes, some raisins and a slightly acidy note like grapes. Like fresh bread, which is not yet finished but needs 5 more minutes, broken up – if that makes sense to you?  Palate: Very sweet! I didn't expect that the first time. Malt, Vanilla, a hint of burnt wood, spicy/briny, hints of peat beneath it    Finish: a hint of smoke, briny, but the sweetness stays on the lipps, caramel notes  Conclusion: Well, don't know what to make of this one, I liked the nose by far the best, the rest was to sweet for my taste, the combination with the burnt notes was quite nice but all in all this is the Whisky from Islay I enjoyed the least so far. A comparison to the Laddie or Scotish Barley from Bruichladdich might be interesting! Looking at the paragraph about the Bunna on the Beginner's List, I had to say “wow” that is an impressive word cloud! On the second note I see that u/texacer put down “sherry cask” so I guess I could delete my questionmark behind Sherry on the nose but I'm too lazy (and would probably manage to get that wrong as well...) I didn't find it prominent on the palate or finish though. And I did hit the biggest words 'sweet', 'salt' (→ briny) and 'malt' but for me most of the other notes were burried under the sweetness. Again I can see why many people like it, I just don't because it's to sweet...   Would I buy it again?:  No, not now and probably not later. Though it's a fine dram. I'll have to talk to Josh about another sample to compare it to some of the Bruichladdich range though...  Score: 78/100 kinda hard to judge as it's definitely not my preferred style of scotch, but for me it's some where between ok and good...  Quick-Info on the scores: To give you an idea what those numbers mean to me I added the table below. I kept the /100 though to keep it comparable and reviewbotable. Everything below 73 isn't really my type of Scotch even though I accept that my 68 could be your 93 and vice versa...     100 - 96 95 – 87 86 – 78 78 - 73    Wow! Holy mother of God! Really, really good! Good! Ok!    The full story behind the dram (if you've got the time for that...)  This is often recommended as an easy entry into Islay or Islay-styled malts for that matter. I don't know why. If the distillery wasn't actually located on Islay you would not think that this actually is an Islay malt. Therefore I don't know how or why this is referred to as a „lighter Islay“ and such alike. Yes, geographically speaking it is exactly true but if we speak of the style of malt generally associated with Islay then this is far from true. Maybe, the salt/brine note is an easy entry into Island/Coastal Scotches in general? I don't know...And since I'm trying to keep this short, this seems like a good ending...so...yeah...until next time folks"
Scotch,3djl16,RONALDROGAN,2,Thu Jul 16 20:10:35 2015 UTC,I'm surprised you didn't like this more. I have the Bunn 18yr and it's fantastic.  Maybe the age makes a big difference here?
Scotch,3djp85,WhiskeyMasterRace,2,Thu Jul 16 20:38:47 2015 UTC,"Good afternoon /r/Scotch! Recently a Total Wine opened up near me so I needed to head over and check things out. They have a massive selection and generally decent prices for the area. They also have tons of house brand products and pushy employees that talk up the products as if they are something of legend. As I was walking the one of them found me and said ""Ah, Scotch guy! Boy do I have something for you!"" He led me over to where the Grangestone line was on the shelf and start to sing its glory. I already had a $50 bottle in my hand so I wasn't looking to spend too much more. He shows me this whisky, a Double Cask matured single malt for $25 and proceeds to tell me that it's just like Balvenie 12 Doublewood and maybe even as good as the 17 year. I read over the bottle and ask him to tell me how they compare. The next sentence had the word smooth in it four times. I pointed to both casks being bourbon barrels (much like Woodford Reserve Double Oaked) and acknowledged that Balvenie's second cask is sherry. He then started talking a whole lot less and seemed embarrassed. I laughed and said that I would buy it anyways! I've been looking for more cheap options for Scotch, especially that are single malts anyways. The last single malt I had at this price point was Speyburn ""Brandon Orach"" which I couldn't stomach more than a few sips of neat, and gave it a well deserved 24/100...Let's see if this cheapy fares any better...    Grangestone Double Cask, Highland Single Malt, NAS, 40% ABV, $25 locally  Nose Golden delicious apples, dried apricots, honey, malt, oak, slight citrus, floral notes. The youth gives it a fresh feeling, but the roughness of the spirit is still there in the background. The second dip in oak definitely smoothed a lot, but it didn't get enough. Still, enjoyable on the nose. 8/10  Taste Fruit pie filling, oak, slight vanilla, orange rind, pen ink. Some nice flavors initially then this nasty ink like note peeks out at the end. The youth is more of a detriment here than the nose. This was almost good 32/50  Body A medium-thick body with slightly syrupy feel that leaves a lot of oil. Too thick, too much oil. 5/10  Finish The finish is a low lingering warmth after a gentle hint of heat up front. Some of the fruit notes hang around nicely but over time they become more astringent. 15/20  Value For a single malt this doesn't have a hell of a lot of competition in my area price wise. It's an almost good whiskey for $25 so I can't possibly be upset that I spent on this bottle. I will not buy this one again, but may try the 18 or 21 year old offerings in the future. 7/10    Overall If you refuse to drink blended Scotch whisky then this might be the bottom shelf bottle that you've been looking for. Otherwise, something like Famous Grouse or Grant's may better suit you. This whisky, though unlike the ignorant promises made by the Total Wine employee is almost good enough to keep around. I guess I'm going to try some Scotch based cocktails out with this guy. Total: 67/100  Scotch Review 37  Network Review 119"

Scotch,3di93c,HawkI84,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:25:36 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge Black Grouse fan. It's not super peaty, but it has a noticeable phenolic component and is – by far – my favourite whisky at its price point.   As /r/chasonreddit mentions, Big Peat is a frickin' peat bomb. Compass Box's Peat Monster is also wickedly heavy on the phenol.  Happy tasting!"
Scotch,3di93c,ianvitro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:42:15 2015 UTC,"Finlaggan isn't a blend, but it's in the blended price range and not one of the usual suspects. Make sure to either try the Old Reserve or Cask Strength."
Scotch,3di93c,wiep,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:01:53 2015 UTC,"Black Bottle is extremely underwhelming compared to its former self. The new blend they're putting out has almost no peat to it whatsoever.  Black Grouse is alright, for the price. Not super peaty though.  Johnnie Walker is not alright, for the price. Otherwise it's still an alright product.  Compass Box has a bottle called ""Peat Monster"" which is not as peaty as the name implies. It's also more expensive than most introductory Islay single malts. Not recommended for the price.  Campbelltown Loch was my favorite peated blend. Reminds me of a cheap Springbank. That said, it's still not going to punch you in the face with peat. It's kind of like the Black Grouse, but a lot nicer overall. Definitely more palatable than JW Black.  Great King Glasgow Blend has some peat to it. It's pricier than the others, in my area. It definitely costs more than a number of Bowmore single malt bottlings. Might as well just get the Bowmore.  Haven't had too many other blends that were considerably peaty."

Scotch,3di5p9,oonniioonn,2,Thu Jul 16 15:18:19 2015 UTC,"Seconded. With all the sugar and fat competing with the scotch the flavour's going to be very muddled no matter what you put in. Better to save your good stuff for dishes that will allow it to be the primary focus.  And if you want smoky sweet, cheat and use a little strongly-brewed lapsang souchong. It's a stronger smoke flavour than, say, a Laphroaig so use a light hand it you go that route."

Scotch,3di5p9,TryptamineX,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:25:54 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for something smokey and peaty, a Caol Ila might be a good choice. It's got that Islay smoke and peat, but it is also lighter and has some nice, sweeter, lemony citrous notes.   If you're just looking for any whisky, a bourbon might be worth looking into over a scotch. The corn malt makes bourbon a lot sweeter, so it fits naturally with a dessert."
Scotch,3di5p9,ImpoverishedYorick,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:17:09 2015 UTC,"Campbelltown Loch is a nice cheap blend, with a moderate amount of smoke to it. It's not as smoky as the Corryvrecken by a mile, but the price point should make one feel better about experimenting with it.  I might recommend a Bowmore as well, since they're pretty affordable for an Islay single malt. Unfortunately, I've not tried any of them so I don't really know what kind of peat character it will impart.  In any case, I would highly recommend making a batch of frosting before you plan on making the cupcakes. That way you can split it into smaller experimental portions and use varying amounts of whisky to see how strong its influence is on the finished product. The icing recipe itself may mask some good flavors and bring out the horrid flavors, too."
Scotch,3di5p9,Balthanos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:51:10 2015 UTC,"I think it all depends on what flavor profile you want. Whisky varies greatly.. even in the scotch department. You shouldn't have to worry about the ""sweetness"" of the whisky since it's going to masked by the confectioner sugar you use for the buttercream. So really you are looking at spicy, smoky, peat, tannin.... Or you know, use the chart to figure it out.  http://i.imgur.com/1fh6eyc.png"

Scotch,3dh5rl,jrsheppa,3,Thu Jul 16 06:07:18 2015 UTC,"Hello Scotchit, this is my first review. I am a new member but have been a scotch fan for several years now. I like to have something several times, taking notes several times and comparing and compiling them before making up my mind regarding a whisky. With samples, I try to break it up into three or four separate drams.  I recently received this sample in a swap from /u/madgraf and had it over several sittings.  Region:   Speyside  Distillation Process:   Cask #16289, unsure of the ABV, tastes like high 40s  Barrel Aging:   15 years; entire life in Oloroso sherry casks  Color:   Light Amber  Nose:   Brown or toasted sugar, oak, mint, honey, hint of raisin, musky note like dusty books or an old library  Palate:  Sucking dryness; reminiscent of Ardbog to a lesser extent; little sherry, milk chocolate, oak, hint of salty brininess (not nearly as sweet as I expected)  Finish:   Pretty long, sherry and milk chocolate fading to pepper, hint of tobacco smoke and some earthiness, like dirt  Balance:  Not terribly complex, the balance feels somewhat off, sweet on the nose but much dryer in the palate and finish  Prominent Notes:  Mint and must on the nose, dry milk chocolate in the palate, milk chocolate note continues into the finish  Overall:   As an initial comment, I really don’t think water changed the character of this whisky very much and I would not recommend it.  At first, when I tried it, I was taken aback and did not like it one bit.  With the following two drams, my opinion did not change.  Only on the fourth and final dram did I finally begin warming up to it.  I find the milk chocolate flavor and the strong mint in the nose unusual but appealing over time, so if those appeal to your taste or sense of adventure, then I recommend this bottle.  Otherwise, its a pass for me at $100 and, although I recognize these are single barrels, it makes me wary of buying future bottles.  I just think there are a lot of other whiskies in this same price range that are notably better, such as other sherry bombs like various Glendronachs or simply other whiskies like Lagavulin 12. I would be far more interested in the $75 range.  Honestly, I just remember other Balvenie expressions more fondly…  Rating:  B- (would have been a C, maybe C+, but for the final dram)"
Scotch,3dh5rl,madgraf,2,Thu Jul 16 06:08:20 2015 UTC,Nice review on this one - sorry you didn't enjoy it too much. The ABV is 47.8 so you were pretty close in your guess :)
Scotch,3dh5rl,TheRedEminence,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:46:03 2015 UTC,"No problem, without the sample, I probably would have bought a bottle and been disappointed. So you saved me tons of money. And its not a bad whisky by any means, its just not particularly good IMHO, especially at that price point. If I found one for 65/70, I'd probably buy it."
Scotch,3dh5rl,slanderousu,2,Thu Jul 16 14:12:23 2015 UTC,The old single-barrel 15 is what got me into scotch.  Im not a fan of the sweet flavored barrels and their prices are no longer viable.

Scotch,3dh5rl,ReadyWillingAndAbe,2,Thu Jul 16 15:21:06 2015 UTC,Balvenie is pricing themselves out of relevance.
Scotch,3dh5rl,bscepter,2,Thu Jul 16 10:32:22 2015 UTC,"i took the balvenie tour last year (possibly the best in scotland) and bottled my own cask-strength 12 YO from a sherry butt. it was an absolutely fantastic whisky. but, yes, $100 is too much for this. for a similar feel, i picked up a bottle of aberlour à'bunadh batch 50 the other day for $58. i realize it's NAS, but it tastes as sweet and rich as the balvenie did, provided you add a teaspoon or two of fresh water."
Scotch,3dgiju,friendly-atheist,7,Thu Jul 16 02:20:57 2015 UTC,"Hello Scotchit! I'm a long time lurker, but finally mustered up the courage to do a review after stumbling on this fine dram. This bottle was a birthday gift, but I got to pick it. Ignore the picture to some extent, the cask number isn't right, but everything else is. Disclaimer, I added a slight bit of water, since this guy is cask strength at 57%. Here it goes:  Nose: Fruity and caramely. Slight alcohol nose, but suprisingly low given the ABV. Hazelnut with a hint of toasted vanilla, and some chocolate too (this was surprising to me). The nose is lovely.  Taste: Incredibly balanced. Earthy to an extent, followed by some slight orange and moderate maltiness. Toffee comes to mind as well. It isn't harsh at all, in fact, with the amount of water I added (not much) I'm surprised at the lack of alcohol burn from it. Slightly spicy as well.  Mouthfeel: Wow. This one just coats the tongue. Incredibly smooth. My mouth is slightly numb after drinking each sip. This is the most velvety sensation I've ever gotten from a scotch whisky.  Finish: It lingers forever, offering you the opportunity to keep tasting it. The hazelnut comes back, despite not having it in the taste as much as the nose. Toffee is also there for sure, but the finish definitely has some sweetness to it as well. The oak and what I would guess is the sherry comes through well on the finish.  Overall: A fantastic whisky. In my opinion, the best I've ever had. I've never had a whisky in this price range before, so that might contribute some to it, but this is a fine dram. I love the mouthfeel on this. I don't often get drawn to a Scotch because of the mouthfeel, but I'd be lying if I didn't say this contributed to the rating. The mouthfeel on this Scotch is just amazing. The flavors with this one are also fantastic. The orange caught me completely off guard and I love that. This is a bottle you want to buy.  Rating: 96/100  Edit: I should add that I had this the other night without water, and it was a more intense version of the events listed above, particularly with the numbing factor of the mouthfeel. The orange was also more pronounced. I guess this might be expected."

From Blackadder?  For $100?  Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeit.  $100/ 750 ml / 58%  Nose:  Sea spray, driftwood, overripe banana, diesel smoke, a whole pig roasting on a spit, yard clippings, garlic and onions cooking in olive oil.  Somewhat muted for a cask strength whisky.  Palate:  Heavy like a claymore.  Oilier than a Roman Senator.  Campfire smoke, pork belly, garlic, rosemary, lemon zest, mango, papaya, sea salt, leather, vanilla.  It’s sweet, sour, salty, and savory all in one.  Wow.  Finish:  A long, warm, gentle ride of drying bittersweet oak and burning eucalyptus leaves and bark.  A lovely end to a delicious whisky.  The Verdict:  This is the best whisky I’ve ever had.  The only detraction is that the nose, while lovely, is so faint at 58%, with and without water.  I’m shocked it was only $100, even on sale, and having now tasted it I’m actually both sad and angry that I didn’t get 2 or 3.  This is what peated whisky is meant to be.

In a recent swap with /u/belbivfreeordie, he sent me an intriguing mystery sample, and since I'm feeling adventurous today I figured I'd give it a try!   Intriguing Mystery Sample from /u/belbivfreeordie  Strength: ??%  Color: Gold.   Nose: Rich, with a bit of brine. I could have sworn I smelled a little peat when I first poured it, but nosing it now I'm not getting any. Pretty solidly briny though. Salty beach air and a little bit of fruity sweetness.  A nice malt backbone holds it all together.   The nose is somewhere between Bunnahabhain 12 and The Laddie 10.   Palate: Very soft peat and more brine. I'm thinking my inkling from the nose is going in the right direction: a lightly peated Islay. I think it's probably 10-12 years, and 43-46% ABV.  Finish: It finishes with salt and chocolate, a nice mix of savory and sweet. It goes down easy, but doesn't fade too quickly.   Summary: This is a nice dram, and just like my last mystery dram it's a great summer one. Not too heavy with some ocean air notes that are fitting for warm weather.   Score: 87/100   Guess: There are notes that remind me of Bunna 12, The Laddie 10, Caol Ila 12, and Talisker 10, but it doesn't quite strike me as any of them, so I'll guess it's none of them.   I'm going to take a shot in the dark and guess that this is not a distillery bottling, but something like Peat Smoke, Islay Storm, or another non-OB that's essentially lightly peated single malt Islay.

I put in a bit of every enjoyable dram that has passed through my possession recently, the only rules being:   scotch  malt whisky only  only ex-bourbon or ex-sherry maturation, no other finishes    There is in fact a relatively high proportion of Laddie 10 in there, as well as Benromach 10. The rest of the list includes Lagavulin 12 and DE, Laphroaig QC and Cairdeas 2014, Highland Park 12 and Dark Origins, Springbank 12 CS and 15, Glenmorangie 18, Tomatin 18, Glenlivet 18, Oban DE, Balvenie 15 SB Sherry, and Kilchoman 100% Islay.

I kept getting an impression of something I know that would suddenly be gone and replaced by something different.  I haven't tried Springbank 15, Oban DE, or Tomatin 18, but I've at least tasted the rest. Glad to see a significant amount is the Laddie Ten, and were it not for the fruitiness from some of those sherried whiskies I might have guessed it to be that.   Thanks for a truly intriguing sample!

Scotch,3dgb7w,Lasidar,3,Thu Jul 16 01:20:07 2015 UTC,"Glenlivet 12  Appearance: Amber  Nose: Some pear, quite a malty cereal note, pretty one dimensional.  Taste: Ginger and pepper on the arrival, some malty sweetness, mild white fruits.  Finish: Finishes slightly dry and spicy. Short.  Notes: There's a reason this is often recommended as an entry level malt; it's fairly decent and approachable. That's about all it has going for it though. Low complexity, and a swift finish. Great if you are starting out, but don't expect much out of it if you have some experience under your belt.  Score: 76/100     Old Pulteney 17  Appearance: Amber -4  Nose: Quite fruity (both white and some tropical), some pear, pineapple, mango, honeysuckle, coconut.  Taste: Nice malty honey arrival, quite thick in the mouth, nice complex fruit which is well integrated with the mild wood spice, apple, pear, peach, white grapes, vanilla, white pepper.  Finish: Finishes with spice felt in the cheeks, and lingering fruity sweetness. Medium-long.  Notes: This is a great whisky. Very light and delicate, but full of fruity and floral complexity. It's difficult to say if the 17 is a big improvement over the 12. I would say the gains are marginal. The 12 is probably still the best quality to dollar ratio, but the 17 is definitely better. If you like the 12, the 17 is worth your time.  Score: 86/100     Glenmorangie 18  Appearance: Amber  Nose: Lots of dried fruits, almost a very faint sherry note (not sure if they use sherry casks in this one), vanilla, a very faint note of old fusty wood.  Taste: Nice and sweet on the arrival, honey, some caramel, hint of white fudge, pear, apple, some lime, very mild ginger.  Finish: It clings to the palate on the finish, with lingering sweet fruits. Medium length.""  Notes: I'm a big Glenmorangie fan, so needless to say I had high expectations for the 18. Like the 12, it is quite light and fruit, however, unlike the 18, the fruits have gotten even more complex. In addition, the additional age has made it super mellow; there is almost no heat or spice in this one. Fantastic.  Score: 87/100     Caol Ila 1998 (Unpeated, 15yo)  Appearance: Amber -3  Nose: A nice fruity nose, peach, white grape, pear, melon. There is definite peat here, despite this being ""unpeated"" (refill casks maybe, or some other indirect influence?). The peat is extremely mild, and comes across as almost sweet.   Taste: Very rich arrival, vanilla, toffee, caramel, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, clove. Very complex, with a background note of sweet smoke. Lovely profile; reminds me somewhat of an older highland park, but with less smoke and more rich fruits.  Finish: The peat asserts itself a bit more on the finish, but still remains fairly subdued. Some pepper and lingering fruit.  Notes: The profile on this one is fantastic. The fruits are incredibly rich and complex, and the notes of sweet peat are very interesting. A lovely whisky.

Scotch,3dfq4p,axceptnosilence,6,Wed Jul 15 22:29:44 2015 UTC,"Been really looking around for a new bottle to pick up recently. At first I was looking at getting another Islay because I really enjoyed Lag 16 and wanted to try something similar, but then I received a bottle of Laphroaig 10 from my Uncle and I have been thoroughly enjoying that. So I then aimed my purchase towards the other end of the flavour spectrum. I have tried sherried whiskies, my favourite being A'bunadh, so I wanted to try a port finished Whisky and Benriach's 15 Tawny Port Finish looked like the perfect purchase for me, so I picked up a bottle. Non chillfiltered, natural colour and 46% ABV screams great Scotch. Have I been enjoying it? Let's find out.     Price: $85 CAD     Colour: A dark orange (Very unique, especially since there was no colour added)     ABV: 46% ABV     Nose: Candied fruits; Oranges, lemons, and apricots. Angel food cake, bakery bread, and maraschino cherries. Salted caramel liqueur, light wood smoke, fresh cut grass and milk chocolate linger in the background. The port comes through pretty mild here but not to the point where it becomes completely unnoticeable. There is a uniqueness on the nose that I can't quite distinguish, but something that sets it apart from nose of any other whisky I've tried. Despite being a higher ABV, there isn't any overpowering alcohol scents.      Taste: The first thing I notice is the thick, oily mouthfeel, it coats the whole of my mouth with this velvety smooth, thick warmth. The port is a lot stronger here than on the nose, it has a really pleasant arrival. Beneath the wineyness, there is a distinct flavour of melted butter and earthiness. Grape jelly is also present. There is a lot of sweetness here and I would argue that it is too overpowering BUT the melted butter flavours really do a lot to balance it out to be almost a perfect level of sweetness. I could definitely sip this all the time without being bothered by how sweet it is. Great balance of flavours, while there isn't a lot going on, the notes I do get are loud, and delicious.  This is really flavourful stuff.      Finish: Surprisingly smokey! Not anything like islay smoke though, I would compare it to soft oak smoke. Again the grape jelly is there as well lemon cake and candied oranges. I'm also getting something I can really only describe as concrete floor, or maybe like a school gymnasium floor, it isn't unpleasant, it isn't strong, it's just there and I can't really explain it.      Conclusion: In my opinion this is a lot different from anything I've tasted before and while I can make some comparisons of this to a sherry bomb there is so much that sets it apart. It truly was a unique flavour experience and something I did really enjoy! That being said, I could see this being too sweet for some people. However I enjoyed it very much and I wont let that alter my rating.      BoardGameGeek Rating: 8/10  x/100 Rating: 89/100     This is great stuff. I really liked it and I would recommend everyone give it a try if you don't mind a sweeter dram. It's definitely different than an islay, but also different than a fruity sherried whisky. While I wouldn't drink this everyday, I could definitely see myself always keeping a bottle of this stuff around. Seriously good stuff!"

Scotch,3df3nt,Single-Malt-Savant,8,Wed Jul 15 19:48:28 2015 UTC,"Hello Scotchit, Single-Malt-Savant is back from vacation with Review #12: Aberfeldy 12  I picked this bottle up at one of the many duty-free’s I passed through during the last two weeks because I haven’t had any Aberfeldy yet and there doesn’t seem to be a lot of Aberfeldy Reviews on here so I wanted to contribute to my very favorite Whisky-Community by giving you some more intel on the Aberfeldy 12.  This is the new bottle with the neat black and yellow design.  Nose: Very fruity. Ripe Fruits, Red Apples as well as some tropical fruits. Malt, Honey and Toffee Notes. There’s some Vanilla and Spices in the background. Some Cereal Notes are in there as well. Very enjoyable.  Taste: Very delicate. Again there is this sweet maltiness, the vanilla and toffee notes but it is also quite spicy. Although the flavours are very enjoyable, it is too delicate, too watered down.  Finish: Sweet Malt and very enjoyable cereal notes in the surprisingly long finish.   A good whisky for the price paid. The Nose is easily and by far the best aspect of this whisky, it is extremely enjoyable and rather complex for a whisky this young. If this review was based on the nose alone, this would have scored much, much higher. Unfortunately, the taste costs this Whisky so many points. There are no bad flavours in there, it is actually quite enjoyable but the problem is that the taste is watered down. It would be much better, if it was bottled at 46% ABV or higher. A shame really, that the lust for profits and higher bottle-output so drastically wins over any quality considerations, this could have been so good. Anyway, it is still a very enjoyable dram with the new bottle looking quite cool so I don’t regret purchasing it, but I’m not so sure yet that I will get another one.  80/100"
Scotch,3df3nt,XtReMe98,3,Wed Jul 15 19:48:37 2015 UTC,You hit the nail on the head... i picked up this bottle over the DeWars and after trying both i had to say that i did like the aberfeldy a bit better..   Fairly decent for it's price but i'd probably try something else in the same price range next.. It hasn't sold me on a re-buy quite yet..
Scotch,3df3nt,dangerstein,3,Wed Jul 15 22:26:56 2015 UTC,"So here's the thing with finding something else in the price range: good luck, tell me when you find something. I get a duty-free liter for $33 american. Not only can I not find any single malt in that price range, I can't find any (actual) quality blends either. Combine the unusually low price with a solid whiskey that has (in my opinion) an excellent finish, and I'll take the Aberfeldy over pretty much any single malt in the $40 to $60 range except Laphroaig QC - which is still a good $20 more expensive. This is the hot hatchback of single malts, without a question."
Scotch,3df3nt,XtReMe98,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:28:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip.. I'm always shy away from buying scotches in this price range as most of the time i get disappointed but i guess i have to say that i should be happy that I, as the OP, didn't regret my purchase..   I guess i'll have another glass tonight.. lol"

Scotch,3dffs0,kdz13,5,Wed Jul 15 21:12:34 2015 UTC,"*EDIT: I suck at photo reuse.  The two images are http://i.imgur.com/BzkOlID.jpg and http://i.imgur.com/UFjRWzi.jpg  I'll be under my desk crying at my ineptitude if anybody needs me.  I'm actually unclear if this would be a more correct picture Thanks to /u/tvraisedme for the sample - please tell me about the photos!  Also a note that this review rounds out my reviews of various Kilchoman finishes  This is just a quick pre-happy hour review. Conference call is delayed, is it worth jumping on a project for 30 min? I think not! Plus, the conference call is now postponed into a timeslot where it will be stealing happy hour time anyway. Go go whisky review!   Initial Impressions: sherry decidedly noticeable as I pour Nose: sherry. Ethanol (solvent/cleaning product) and then a bit of peat coming. Some fruit - grapes or cherries? Leather, though I usually associate that with old whisky, it's here too.  Taste: peat forward, a hint of rotten grain turns to sherry raisins soon. A touch of pepper and a wee bit of iodine.  Finish: aftertaste turns tannic and sour after flirting with sherry and peat notes ever so briefly. Before all that, there was a subtle pepper taste in the medium-short burn.   Two things of note here. Firstly, this whisky is young. It shows this with brashness in its various flavors. They are not overpowering, but they are just not integrated. I was amused how the sherry was first in the nose and then the peat in the taste - as if I had poured a sherry chaser first and then my Islay whisky second, then drank in the opposite order. The tastes are nearly that separated. Secondly, as mentioned in my previous Kilchoman review, this peat is nearly smokeless. Weird.  The further I get in my journey, the less I am liking the sherry bomb.  Score: 86/100"
Scotch,3dffs0,SeienShin,2,Wed Jul 15 21:16:40 2015 UTC,You should try the single sherry cask releases. Much better than this pre-Loch Gorm sherry cask release which is basically a Loch Gorm.
Scotch,3dffs0,mapolo29,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:23:43 2015 UTC,I hope to one day
Scotch,3dffs0,LetThereBeR0ck,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:31:40 2015 UTC,SeienShin knows what's up.  The single cask sherry release is miles ahead of this in my opinion.  If you thought 46% Loch Gorm was brash you are in for a ride if you ever try the single cask.
Scotch,3dffs0,mapolo29,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:16:59 2015 UTC,"Loch Gorm was my favorite of the Kilchomans I've had so far, but the other two were Machir Bay and 100% Islay. Their stuff is peaty enough that I liked having some Sherry influence to calm it down."
Scotch,3dffs0,LetThereBeR0ck,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:38:52 2015 UTC,Oh I still enjoy Loch Gorm. It's good. I just think the single cask sherry is better.  Also from what I hear there is some noticeable variability between Loch Gorm releases.

Scotch,3dffs0,maglev_goat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:58:05 2015 UTC,"Re: smokeless peat, having been to the distillery it's worth noting the water they have on site is very peaty (toilets flush a brown colour). The peat they use to smoke is unprocessed and hand cut, a lumpier, more soil-looking peat than the usual compressed blocks you see commercially. I'm going to guess both of these could have an impact - a cooler, more watery peating?  That said we had the basic tour. It was OK, but compared to other Islay tours... if I went back I'd opt for the Premium or Manager's tour if I wanted to get more questions answered."

Once you're willing to spend more, you can also try combinations of sherry and peat, like Lagavulin 16yr, Ardbeg Uigeadail, Highland Park Dark Origins, Bowmore 15yr Darkest."
Scotch,3dgmz6,quercus_robur,2,Thu Jul 16 03:08:09 2015 UTC,Those are really good suggestions. Something like the Ardmore Traditional Cask and Bowmore 12yr could also fit into the middle of that first list. But I'd start with tasting JW Black first (commonly available) - and personally prefer the Highland Park. If willing to spend just a little more the Talisker 10yr is another option.
Scotch,3dgmz6,cpfselfbuilt,3,Thu Jul 16 03:27:47 2015 UTC,"I second the Bowmore 12! The others of course fit nicely, too, but that was my first thought!"
Scotch,3dgmz6,j4ni,3,Thu Jul 16 06:16:12 2015 UTC,Highland Park 12 is a nice stepping stone towards peat.

Scotch,3detix,wiep,3,Wed Jul 15 18:39:30 2015 UTC,"Between 2005 and 2013, Bruichladdich produced several batches of their Rocks expression. The name refers to the Gneiss Rock - the 1.8 billion year old rock that filters the water from Bruichladdichs source, and not to whisky on the rocks. When I came across a few bottles for a reasonable price, I just couldn't resist bringing them home. It's a NAS single malt, that spent some time in French red Banyul wine casks.           Bruichladdich Rocks / 43% / NAS / €50 / Bottled: 2009 * Nose: Young, fresh and spirity. Light peat, light red fruit and some peppery spices. * Taste: Quite creamy, with spicy salt upfront. Vibrant flavours with some rough edges. The red fruit takes the stage about halfway, with sweet raspberry and lots of salted cranberry. This is the best part of this whisky - I like how some of the flavours show up out of nowhere. * Finish: A nice, medium-length finish. Crispy salt and raspberry flavoured liquorice linger on for about 20 seconds.       Rating: 82/ 100       It's not an overly complex whisky, but it's definitely not a boring single malt either. The first time that I picked up a bottle of Bruichladdich Rocks, the average retail price was about €28. For that price, it was a steal. Just recently, I've seen the last leftovers in stores for €80, which I think is overpriced. Around €40-50 would be a reasonable price - in that price range I'd definitely recommend it."

Scotch,3ddlm8,TOModera,5,Wed Jul 15 13:08:09 2015 UTC,"Continuing on my ongoing series I call ""Talisker: Hardly Know Her!"", we have Talisker 25 (2011 Release) up next.  And you may be asking yourself: Where is that large automobile? And that's a good question for talking heads to discuss, not so much me.  More so you may be asking why I put the release up in the title, as I typically don't. And I'll tell you why: Because originally I was aiming to buy the 2009 release.  I find out what drams from a variety of sources (4). One of these many (4) sources is the book ""1001 Whiskies to taste before you die"". With such a joyfully happy name, how could I not?  One of the Taliskers they recommend is Talisker 25 (2009 Release). And I thought I had bought it. I didn't, but said ""Oh well."" It's the same stuff, right?  Wrong.  The reason they recommend the 2009 is because it's cask strength at 50+%, where as this one is the cute 45.8 they like for almost all other drams.  Oh well. I'll have the 2009 some day, I'm not worried. So let's see how the 2011 tastes, shall we?  Editor's Note (yes it's still me): I did not know the difference while reviewing this one, so my bad luck did not cloud my judgement.  Price: N/A at the LCBO... they do have the 2009 though... dammit. Nope, they have this one, at $351.90 (CAD). Damn website was off.  Region: Island  Abv: 45.8%  Colour: 2.5Y 7/8  Nose: Pear, brine, smoke, raspberry, Sprite, pork chops, lavender chocolate, coconut  Really nice nose. Has this floral note that blends well with the earth and sweet notes.  Also pork chops... who doesn't like the smell of Pork Chops (other than people who don't eat Pork, I guess).  Taste: Peat, pepper, chipotle, cranberry, salt'n vinegar chips, mango, leather, birch sap  Where as the 18 was lackluster and muted, this one has a lot of peat, pepper, and brine notes. Lots of them. Like eating pickles on the bottom of the sea with a pissed off person.  Yeah. That salty. Very tasty. A little umami works with it as well.  Finish: Cocoa, smoke, salt, tarragon, woody, oregano, mint, allspice, apple  This is one of the few Taliskers that I've had that has developed a really complex finish. Not as complex as the taste or nose, however it's really starting to blossom (like the show, not so much the flower).  Tasty.  Conclusion: This is a really good dram. For all the worries of a Cask Strength dram versus a lower Abv., it still delivers, and very well at that.  I may need to pick up a 2009. Could be fun at Cask Strength.  None the less, it didn't set off memories, yet came really close. And 350 isn't so bad for a 25 year whisky that is above 43%. The floral notes and the earth are the heroes of the dram. The brine is a little unpleasant at first, however I liked it this time. Don't know why, usually I don't like brine at all.  Oh well. Pick up a bottle, it's worth it.  85/100  Scotch review #340, Island review #30, Whisky Network review #507  Other Talisker reviews:   Talisker 10 Talisker 18 Talisker 57° North Talisker Distiller's Edition 2012 Talisker Port Ruighe"

Forgive the lack of intro, with so many expressions of so many distilleries I feel like a lost child in an awesome playground with all these Scotch samples.  I've had Caol Ila's before and have never been disappointed.   Caol Ila 14 97/11 Chieftain's  55% ABV  Nose: Earthy, ashy peat, hints of smoked meats, some leather, honeyed light fruits, apricot, biscuits.   Palate: Dirt and ash up front and is an overtone throughout.  Undertones of sweetness and floral perfume, ending in something light with tropical fruits.  Pepper and spice, plenty of old wood flavors.   Finish: Dry earthy ash, some lingering sweetness.  Cigar box, and ultimately the lingering flavor of tobacco.   Notes: Love the light color on this.  Glad I could get a sample, but I'm not sure I enjoyed it enough to get a full bottle.  Caol Ila is consistently a good distillery and this was not a disappointment."

Scotch,3ddmgs,Ethanized,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:11:30 2015 UTC,"I own 6 of each.  When you compare them side by side, the real Glencairn are minutely bigger, slightly heavier and seem to be a better crystal as the ping sound you get when flicking them is nicer.  Unless you are picky about your glassware you won't notice much of a difference."
Scotch,3ddmgs,devilsadvocate23,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:11:39 2015 UTC,Can you tell any difference in how stable they are while filled and on a table?
Scotch,3ddmgs,Ethanized,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:18:02 2015 UTC,"I've never spilled from either glass and I never get the feeling that the Bellemain (or however you spell it) glass is unstable but the additional heft of the real Glencairn is in the base.  So, while I don't ever feel that the Bellemain is at risk of tipping I would have to say that the real Glencairn is probably more stable.  I prefer the real Glencairns because of the heft, because the opening is just ever so slightly bigger, because I like the ping and because they have the word ""Gelncairn"" on the bottom in white which becomes visible when sitting on a dark wood table.  That said, I am picky about glassware.  I bought the Bellemain glasses first and it just bugged me that I had a knockoff and finally broke down and bought the real ones.  I will say if you are on a budget and/or not picky about glassware they work just fine."

Scotch,3ddmgs,apollo698,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:44:45 2015 UTC,I tried them before. /u/sladerousu has a mix of the Bellemain and real Glencarians. I doubt I could tell the difference in the nose or taste from one to the other. The Bellemain glasses aren't as heavy and have a slightly deeper bowl at the bottom. I'm going to grab a set for myself.

I didn't do Bowmore, however, and I heard their premium tour is also really good. The Lagavulin tour is fun, and you can do a tasting afterwards. The Ardbeg tour is extensive and incorporates a number of their whiskies into the tour, and finishes with a cool tasting in one of their warehouses. The Laphroaig tour didn't have whisky along the way, but finished in a warehouse where we sampled from 3 different casks and kept a 250-ml bottle of our favourite.   Flip a coin, you'll have an awesome time with both!"
Scotch,3dda7a,ianvitro,2,Wed Jul 15 13:51:40 2015 UTC,"I went in June and did the premium tasting tour at Ardbeg and just the premium tasting at Laphroaig.   It's too bad there are so many hit and miss reviews of Ardbeg, we found it to be great. The tour was long enough and followed by a leisurely tasting of 10, Uig, Corry, Auriverdes, and Perpetuum. The guide, Neil was great. The food at their cafe was fantastic also.   Laphroaig was much shorter as it was only a tasting, but we had 4 lovely whiskys. The new 15, new Carideas, a 30 year old Carideas and a 16 year old single cask from the 'bottle your own' tour leftovers. The guide was awesome there as well (Stevie). That tasting also allows you as many drams from their standard line as you want while you wait, and I tried the Triple Wood.   The only thing I'd keep in mind is that on Sunday most of the longer tours are closed, and it takes a little while to walk from distillery to distillery so you might want to book a cab or plan accordingly."

Hedonism is a blended grain Scotch whisky produced by Compass Box, a blending company, about twice a year.  I've been told this one is from 2008.  I have no idea on profile consistency from year to year.  Distillery Sourcing: Will vary according to batch but typically whiskies from the following distilleries: Cameron Bridge, Carsebridge, Cambus, Port Dundas or Dumbarton.  Wood: 100% first-fill American oak barrels or rejuvenated American oak Hogsheads.  Bottling Details: 43%. Not chill filtered. Natural colour.     Notes  Nose: Bourbon Vanilla, Orchard Peaches, Grassy Hay, Cake Batter, Pears, Rhubarb, Apple, Floral Aged Oak, Hints of Spice (Cinnamon?), Grain  The nose is intricate and evolving.  A new fruit at every turn.       Palate: Hints of Peach Skin, Rhubarb, Apple Juice, Cinnamon, a Building Oak Spice, Fresh Spring Water  The palate is very light, ephemeral at first but it builds on itself.     Finish: Pear and Apple Cores, Wheat Grains, Extending Oak Bitterness ... Grapefruit Pithe (Old?)  Delicate but fairly long finish.     Overall: If you have the presence of mind and the focus to break this one down you'll be rewarded as all of the notes are pleasant and there are layers.  I'm impressed with it.  Would love it at a higher proof but that's my bias speaking.  This earns some fairly high marks for layering and all around deliciousness.

Scotch,3dalcq,Perkeie,13,Tue Jul 14 20:02:29 2015 UTC,"Hi guys!   I've been lurking here since I started drinking whiskies 4 months ago and now it's time to start contributing. As this is my first review I think it's appropriate to also tell something about myself. I'm from Switzerland and I've got introduced by a friend of mine to single malts. He always mentioned that I should try Glenfiddich, because apparently it'd be so much better than those other cheap whiskies. As I wasn't a whisky drinker I didn't heed his advice until about 4 months ago, as I bought my first bottle of Glenfiddich, because I found the cardboard box interesting and it stood out from the other beverages. I wasn't particularly intrigued about the Glenfiddich and a few weeks passed and I wanted to buy appropriate glassware (read: tumblers, like in the movies when they drink whisky...) and luckily I found the Glencairn glasses, but because of the delivery cost I used the opportunity to also buy a scotch. I randomly visited an online shop and had no idea which one to buy until I saw the Oban 14. Another friend of mine visited Oban last year and told me about its destillery and therefore I bought it, without any idea what to expect. As you can see, it was by sheer chance (the cardboard box) that got me into drinking whisky.   I've started writing reviews and taking notes after trying about 10 different scotches. Anyways, don't expect the review to be anything groundbreaking, I'm still a beginner ;)  Review #1: Oban 14Y -  56$, 43%   Nose: Grass and flowers; apples and pears. It reminds of spring and it has a certain freshness to it. Taste: Salty but smooth; a bit creamy and a little smoky. There's also some sweetness and I can still find the apples, but they're not as strong anymore. Finish: Oak and Pepper, spicy and long; still salty and warm Notes: My favourite thing about this scotch is the nose, it's so refreshing and light, you could even mistake it for a cider. There's a hint of smoke in this scotch, but it's very subtle and disappears very quickly in the finish. Comparing the taste to the nose I've found the taste lacking and the finish was too spicy. It's good but I don't find the whole experience outstanding. 81/100"

Scotch,3da66n,Sinjun86,10,Tue Jul 14 18:19:58 2015 UTC,"Ardbeg Supernova 2014 Release  55% ABV   Nose: I didn't even have to get close to the glass to smell the peat wafting from the glass.  Oily peat that is driven by an oily, fishy aroma.  Plenty of smoked salmon.  Lemon zest and citrus oil.  Like collecting pine needles in a forest, then burning them in a camp fire.  Some smoked kippers as well.  There is great layering in the nose for such a heavily peated whisky.  The peat smoke seems to rest on top, closest to your senses.  The fishy notes reside on the next layer, and the citrusy notes on the last.  Well balanced and more complex than I expected. Taste: The peat calms the hell down in the arrival.  It holds a good dose of sea salt.  This sets the stage for the lighter lemon oil and citrus notes.  Refreshingly sweet on the palate as it develops.  It melds into a chocolaty-golden raisin combo.  Some mild vanilla and caramel. Finish: This marks the return of the oily, sooty peat and smoked salmon.  The finish is dry and slightly peppery.  A pleasant nip of alcohol tickles your mouth and lips.  Sweet and salty.   I like the sweeter side to this Ardbeg, it isn't a huge sweet experience, but the the sherry casks seem to give it added sweetness as well as complexity.  Not a smoke show from start to finish, but it strikes a good balance between very heavy peat and fruity sweetness.  91/100  Bruichladdich Octomore 6.3 Islay Barley  5yr. -  64% ABV   Nose: It's as if you are standing next to a raging camp fire that has just been drenched with buckets of water.  The smoke seems to fill every crack and crevice  of your senses.  What's somewhat unexpected, is that within that smoldering fog of smoke is an inherent salty-sweetness.  Sea salt and brine, typical for me in Bruichladdich, and a thick barley note.  Rubber erasers scorched from rubbing them vigorously for too long.  Some mild apple cider vinegar strangely enough.  Slightly nutty, but oily and thick.  The peat doesn't relent. Taste: This is a beast of a whisky when tasted neat.  The tendrils of peat smoke wrap around you in the arrival, pulling you in until the alcohol abruptly smacks you in the face.  Once you come to your senses, you can detect that nice barley note again.  More salt and salted caramel and butterscotch.  The peat doesn't relent. Finish: The finish is miles long, consisting primarily of peat of course.  The peat is still very much in the drivers seat.  The casks have joined the experience in the finish.  There is some toasted oak and butter toffee.  The peat doesn't relent.   An absolute peat lovers dream.  After my first dram enjoyed neat, my mouth and tongue were tingling feverishly.  It was like I dined on a charcoal log for dinner.  I was in perma-grin mode.  For all its peaty ferocity there is some complexity here, not as much as other Octomore's, or other Islay whiskies, but for anyone chasing the peat dragon, this won't matter one bit.  90/100  Both are very good, high quality whiskies.  I scored the Ardbeg a point higher simply because it held more complexity, and more than enough peat to satisfy."

The morning after drinking Ardbeg 10 there's still peat hanging in the air--enough to damn near trip over; with 6.3 I'd to jam my nose in the glass to find it. A great glass, but more subtle than I was expecting (this is my first Octomore)."
Scotch,3da66n,Doneeb,2,Thu Jul 16 00:39:39 2015 UTC,"I was expecting it to be peatier as well.  My friend and I were commenting on how it seemed like they could easily double the PPM and still be quite good.  For me, I think the high ABV really amplified the flavors, including the peat."

Thanks to /u/Rift485 for the sample.  Nose - Very recognizable as a Bruichladdich. Black liquorice, lots of vanilla/vanilla icing, lemon candies, a fresh sea-salty note, golden fruit, black pepper. Very sweet smelling, with some oceany and spicy notes.  Taste - Drier than the nose suggests initially. Raw ginger, honey, vanilla, and golden fruit, giving way to the spice notes - black pepper and maybe some clove  Finish - Honey, black pepper, sea-saltiness, lemon candies, vanilla icing. The sweet, tangy citrus, and spices all get bigger before starting to fade away - this is a very nice and long lasting finish, which I’ve noticed with other Bruichladdichs.  Very nice stuff, on par in my mind with the dearly departed Laddie 10. The big vanilla, fruit, spice, and oceany notes that I normally associate with Bruichladdich are all there, along with a certain freshness I often get from them, that all comes together in a very nice way. I’m not sure there’s anything that unique about it for someone familiar with the distillery profile, but for a nice expression of the distillery’s house style look no further.  89/100"
Scotch,3db4y9,belbivfreeordie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:20:50 2015 UTC,I thought this was stated (though maybe not across the front) to be 6 years? Anyway nice to hear that it's a worthy alternative to Laddie 10.
Scotch,3dbd8u,Frozyme,2,Tue Jul 14 23:22:19 2015 UTC,"Balvenie 14 Caribbean Cask  This is fourth Balvenie I’ve tasted (not counting whatever’s blended in Monkey Shoulder), but first reviewed. I’ve previously had the Doublewood 12 and 17, and the 15yr Sherry Single Cask.  Glencairn – Neat – 43%, $65 for 750ml at local store   Color: Amber gold Nose: Cinnamon, rum, banana, lots of pear - after first sip: molasses, honey, caramel in my face Taste: Vanilla, cinnamon, oak, molasses, vanilla cake frosting, maple syrup and caramel Finish: Medium length, light and peppery, cream and fruit, more cake frosting, banana and pear linger on the tongue   It’s been a while since I’ve had any rum, but this is exactly what I’d envision a rum finished Balvenie to taste like. I also feel like the nose notes and the taste notes were in harmony here. It’s definitely more complex and unique tasting than the standard Doublewood. I have a close friend who is a big rum drinker, I’m curious to see his thoughts.  88/100"

Scotch,3dawqu,horizoning,2,Tue Jul 14 21:20:29 2015 UTC,"Hey Scotchit! Been a few months since I've done any reviews; ever since it got warm out, I've been on a bit of an IPA and margarita bender (dat Espolon blanco hnnng). I've had a few bottles collecting dust on my shelf so I figured it was time to dive back in, so here we go!  Price: $65  Nose: almonds, spice cake, nutmeg, old leather, orange peel, anise, twizzlers.  Taste: plenty of figs and oak, with some maraschino cherries, old leather, dryer sheets, chocolate, brown sugar, strawberry jelly, stewed apples.  Finish: Has a little spice to it, but not too much heat. Black pepper, oak, a whif of campfire smoke, nail polish remover, raisins, dark chocolate, cinnamon, and peanuts as it fades away. Pretty short, with some kick.  Overall: The weakest part of Glendronach 12, aside from its measly 43% ABV, is definitely the finish. That being said, it gains some points back for being non-chill filtered and natural color, and its taste and smell are pretty solid.  82/100: Now I'm not a huge fan of sherried whiskies, but this guy isn't hard to recommend if you're looking to pick up an affordable bottle - I'd say I prefer it to the bottle of Macallan 12 I had a long time ago, and especially to the nasty A'bunadh batch 46 that I never even bothered to review. As with most of my sherried and port-ed experiences, it benefits from a bit of breathing time to reduce solventy flavors, and since it's fucking hot out I like to freeze my glass before pouring rather than use ice. Though I will say that I prefer the sweetness that port finishes bring moreso than the medley of oaky-spicy-whatever that sherry delivers.  Fun fact, as my Glendronach was bottled in 2013, it's supposedly 18 years old in actuality."
Scotch,3dawqu,burythebwoy,2,Tue Jul 14 21:20:39 2015 UTC,Agree on the weak finish. There's also a bitterness on the tongue that loses what was on the palate. A real shame because everything else about it is great!

Scotch,3d9dhm,AvatarTHW,3,Tue Jul 14 15:00:10 2015 UTC,"Review #1: LAGAVULIN Distiller’s Edition  ABV: 43%  Cost: $105  Color: Golden Honey, Amber  Nose: Birch wood, caramel, slight sherry and decently strong oak aroma, plenty of smoke that surrounds these scents.  Palate: Initial sherry taste that develops smoothly into a caramel swirl, followed by an oak taste that continues with a smoked brisket like flavor.  Finish: Fire and oak, followed by a charcoal taste that includes an oak smoke that beautifully compliments any steak or cigar.   After Dram Comments: While this is my first review, Lagavulin 16 year is my favorite single malt and my standard for preference since I’ve become a scotch drinker. That said, the Distiller’s Edition is not as good as the 16 year in my opinion because it lacks the smoky caramel flavor of the 16, and is definitely a smokier whisky than the 16. That said, the Distiller’s Edition certainly is a good whisky that is a rite of passage for anyone exploring the Islay depth chart of the Classic Malts of Scotland. The Distiller’s Edition is definitely a more sherry and smoke focused single malt, and that makes it a unique whisky compared to its 16 year counterpart. While not my go-to-dram, this single malt is definitely worthy of a place on my shelf, and definitely distinguishes itself among single malts. 88/100"

Scotch,3d8zyx,TOModera,5,Tue Jul 14 13:06:46 2015 UTC,"This is the first in a three part series I'm calling ""Talisker: Barely Know her!""  Yes, that should alienate some of my fans nicely.  So, up first we have Talisker 18. Winner of the 2007 World Whisky award for Best Whisky in the World, I've always wondered about this Diageo sponsored whisky. It's suppose to be ""well received just about everyone"". Well that's a tall order to fill.  None the less, I haven't tried it myself. And I always say that I need to try something, not just assume that it's been well bribed into books and awards. And everyone should do that.  I mean, what am I complaining about? I typically (always? sometimes? I don't know) say that peat gets better with time. The peat bombs (Talisker amongst them) mellow out, giving us a BBQ chocolate happy taste.  So what's wrong with Talisker 18? Nothing at the onset. It's not lower than 45%, it's older, it's easier to find, the price isn't too bad, and it'll be peated.  I should enjoy this. So let's see if I do.  Price: N/A at the LCBO  Region: Island  Abv: 45/8%  Colour: 5Y 7/8  Nose: Pepper, smoke, cocoa, raspberry, grassy, jalapeno, BBQ sauce, grapefruit, brine, licorice  Big peat nose with all the notes I love. It's briney, fruity, grassy, and BBQ-y. I do like BBQ. My pants not so much.  It's all over the place in the right way. I'm enjoying this.  Taste: Brine, dill, cocoa, strawberry, smoke, dull artificial vanilla flavouring, arugula  Holy damn am I drinking pickle juice!?!  Once the pickle juice subsides and I get a hold of myself, I notice that this has a very... lax flavour. Sure it's brine-y to start, however after awhile it just tastes like I've run out of the good vanilla extract.  And you don't want to see fat /u/TOModera when he can't bake with his nice vanilla extract.  Finish: Ginger, pepper, salt, smoke, cocoa, grapefruit  Meh finish. Not fake tasting like the taste, more so something I'd expect from a younger malt, or at least a less expensive malt.  I'm not impressed is what I'm saying.  Conclusion: I'd rather have the 10 year. This should be a mature malt I love, and instead it's just kinda okay. I mean, it's better than the 57 North, sure, but it's not really doing much.  I'd say skip this one, unless you really love Talisker. It's not bad (and the nose is bonkers good), I just can't recommend it.  80/100  Scotch review #339, Island review #29, Whisky Network review #506  101 Whiskies to try before you die review #58  1001 Whiskies to taste before you die review #238  Other Talisker reviews:   Talisker 10 Talisker 57° North Talisker Distiller's Edition 2012 Talisker Port Ruighe"

Some people may say I'm crazy but that's truly my experience.   My girlfriend doesn't drink whisky either, not that she despises it, but it's just too strong for her, but that's why I save it for me-time. Occasionally I do have a dram when she's around and sometimes she even smells the whisky, sometimes even liking the nose.   Sharing drams with friends is nice, but most of my friends aren't as into it as I am. They just throw some entry level malt in a tumbler and sip it. Damn shame. I wish I could make them appreciate it more. In the near future I'll host a tasting for them with some insane bottles and I hope that will push them over the edge.

My first bottle was a birthday celebration for me and my dad, a single bourbon cask that really exemplified the magic of a good bourbon cask, but went beyond what most other distilleries might offer.  I tried a sherried Morty at a bar and loved it, so when I saw this on sale with some other bottles from Binny’s, I knew it was time.  $90 / 375 ml / 58.2%  Nose:  White grapes, papaya, white wine, minerals, fresh green apples, amontillado funk, clotted cream, cardamom, mint.  This nose took me for a ride!  Palate:  Thick, oily…like an oil slick.  Creamy milk chocolate, minerals, fresh mint, star anise, cardamom, dark chocolate, beef tenderloin.  Very chocolate-y, and delicious.  Finish: Long, dry, slightly warm.  Dry mint and bitter oak mingle with minerals and a bit of dark rye bread.  This lingers on the tongue for 10-15 minutes.  Wow.  The Verdict:  This has to be one of the most interestingly balanced whiskies I’ve had.  The nose starts out fresh, wet, and sweet, and it transitions on the palate through the finish into a bitter, dry whisky.  Sweet, minty, meaty.  There are some distilleries that must have been dragged through the Twilight Zone, and come out chugging monster juice on the other side, and Mortlach was riding shotgun with Giles Corey in the driver’s seat.  Score: 90/100"

Scotch,3d7vce,treydog9999,3,Tue Jul 14 04:59:30 2015 UTC,"This is a Review of Highland Park 12 Year Old single malt scotch whisky. Bottled at 40% ABV 700 ml. I really wanted to try this one as it is one of the most recommended starter whisky's both here and at ralfy's . I was very excited to try this one as it is the first whisky in this review series that I drank with an Age Statement. Previous before this it was Monkey Shoulder Blended Malt and Talisker Storm.    Tasted in a Copita Nosing Glass, first neat then with a splash of water. This was previously opened.   Appearance: Amber. smaller beads that hang on the line. Some of them barely break surface tension. I don't know the term for it but where the whisky meets the dry glass. Nose: Antiseptic, sweet wood, floral vanilla, lemon honey, roasted coconuts. It was extremely confusing actually, just a lot going on. w/ water No more antiseptic smell, woodier vanilla, banana peel. Taste: Honey comb, bees wax, nuts, tart citrus, citrus rind, and light mouth feel. w/ water more citrus pith flavor coming out and sweet vanilla. The more time I let this mellow with water, it almost became like drinking liquid honey. Finish: Slight alcohol burn, tart (bitterness?) , and more citrus rind/pith flavors. w/ water pepper spice, and living wood. Conclusion: There is a lot going on in this scotch, several notes and layers it is almost confusing. It could just be my nose and palate is just not up to bar to decode it all. However I really enjoyed it mellowing out over time with the water and just become rich and sweet fruity although somewhat more dimensional. I am not sure that I would call this a beginner scotch, not that it is a bad experience. But because as a beginner I cant figure out all the things that are going on. Overall though I think if I sat down with it more and get to know it, i may be able to unpeel the onion. Score: 88/100"

Scotch,3d774p,Sh0wMePotatoSalad,7,Tue Jul 14 01:35:39 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow malt maniacs @ /r/Scotch.  I'm back for my 6th review and, as always, glad to be back to share some tasting notes... As a long time lurker, I think it's fair to say that this particular dram drums up some heated debate.  Let's see where I side...   Higland Park 18 / $110.00 USD / 43% ABV / No Color Added / Pretty sure this is chill filtered however   Color: Amber.  Somewhat of a thin appearance... Nose: Holy Shitballs... This has honestly got to be one of the best noses for any whisk(e)y, let alone Scotch, in my humble and honest opinion.  Ripe fruits, lots of flowers come to the forefront, rose petals, and a slight grassy note.  Towards the end, there is a slight kick of peat.  However, this is different peat as compared to Islay... it is much more subtle and forgiving. Taste: Steady and long developing arrival... Floral tastes follow the nose, with some spices arriving like cinnamon and nutmeg.  There is a nutty, almondy, creamy taste to this however it is not creamy in texture as far as mouthfeel goes.  It is actually a bit on the thin side, in my opinion.  As the taste continues to develop, I'm getting some coastal salt influence and am also getting this very unique aromatic peat flavor.  As a huge fan of Islay, and peat in general, this is hugely welcome. Finish: Long finish.  Sweet and salty.  Oaky and spicy.  More of that aromatic peat smoke.  Immediately after the finish, my mouth starts to water intensely...  I've really never experienced this with any other single malt or blend or whiskey that I've had so far.   All in all, I'm fucking sold American on this stuff.  I know it is expensive for what it is, but when this is compared to something like Macallan 18, which is currently going for >$200 USD, this is a steal at $110.  I've seen this priced at $150, and in my opinion, this is still a must buy even at that price.  This is a significant leap up from the Highland Park 12 in my humble opinion and this is also much better than Highland Park Dark Origins for just a few dollars more.  Score 94/100.  This is currently my highest rated single malt Scotch and I believe it is going to be tough to rate something higher than this (some good competition so far however has been Bruichladdich Black Art 3.1).  This is seriously balanced stuff... I've had the privilege of purchasing 3 bottles within the past year and they all have been very consistent and all would have scored a 94 for me.  If I were to have one complaint, and what keeps this at a 94 is that it is a bit thin as far as mouth feel goes.  I think if Highland Park were to go Non Chill Filtered with this and boost the ABV to 46%, this would be around the 96 marker.   So, what are you waiting for?  Go out and buy this now..."

Scotch,3d774p,RokStacker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:29:31 2015 UTC,Most 18+ year old single malts are around the $100 USD price range by me with some breaking the $200 USD range (Mac 18 for example).  It's a lot of $ but I think it is well worth it...
Scotch,3d774p,FateofJericho,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:42:00 2015 UTC,"After having it, yeah it's probably worth it, but I haven't gone too far out of a $65 price range I put on myself. Ardbeg 10yr & Dalhmore 12yr are the most expensive bottles I've had as I'm still kinda new to actually tasting whiskey.  But I'd never turn a dram of this away!"
Scotch,3d7gcx,Sh0wMePotatoSalad,3,Tue Jul 14 02:49:18 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow malt maniacs @ /r/Scotch.  I'm back for my 7th review and, as always, glad to be back to share some tasting notes... 2nd dram of the night for me. Note, nosing and tasting was done with the addition of water...  Aberlour A'bunadh Batch 49 / $79.00 USD / 60.1% ABV / No Color Added / Non Chill Filtered   Color: Dark Sherry Colored Amazingness.  Thick, oily appearance... Nose: Spiced, candied nuts.  Oranges and heavy sherry aromas stinging the nostrils.  Taste: Intense arrival... Very heavy, thick, oily mouthfeel.  Notes of dark chocolate and oak.  Oranges, dates, plums, and ginger.  Heavy Oloroso Sherry influence (of course of course). Finish: Long and intense finish, even with the water.  Very sweet.  Oaky and spicy.  This is what I'm talking about... amazingly satisfying sherry bomb!   All in all, this is SO much better than the batch 46 that I reviewed here for my first review.  However, I do like to try my malts neat first and this one is just a bit too strong for my liking to drink undiluted.  I feel that the 60.1% ABV just obliterates the palate and completely numbs the taste buds.  A couple teaspoons of water really brings everything into perspective here and allows this amazing juice to shine.  Score 91/100.  I'm really looking forward to my next purchase of A'bunadh... However, I think I'll have to skip on batch 50 given the negative reviews it's been getting.  If you can find this at retail, please don't hesitate and pick this up!  Highly recommended!"
Scotch,3d7gcx,cpfselfbuilt,2,Tue Jul 14 02:59:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review. I've tracked generally positive review ratings for this expression, and picked it up myself. Your notes match my experience. I find it needs a fair amount of water to tame the burn and really open up the flavours (moreso than some other casks strengths I have, for some reason). But that just makes it an even greater bargain! :)"
Scotch,3d7gcx,ReadyWillingAndAbe,2,Tue Jul 14 03:03:14 2015 UTC,My pleasure! Agree about other cask strengths not needing nearly as much water... Lagavulin 12 is a recent malt I've had that comes to mind that only needed a splash of water.  This is definitely a bargain for what you're getting!

Scotch,3d7eoz,Devoz,4,Tue Jul 14 02:36:13 2015 UTC,"Benrinnes 23 - 58.8%   Normally I do not remark on the color, but my goodness, this is a beautiful deep red. Thanks /u/LetThereBeR0ck for the sample. It was well worth the wait.   Nose: Sherry, lots of sherry. Sweet and wonderful red fruits. Almost creamy.  Little bit of cinnamon.   Taste: Sweet fruit, strawberry jam and raisins. This is the best sherry aged whiskey I have ever tasted. Leather and peppers round out this wonderful dram.   Finish: The warm finish lingers. Not overpowering by any means, but it stays on the tongue. Spices and fruit dance in my mouth. Wonderful stuff, this is the best whiskey I have tasted so far.   Rating: 96    Cadenhead’s Benrinnes 25  - 53%   Thanks /u/TOModera for the sample of the Benrinnes 25. It certainly made for an interesting contrast between two well aged Benrinnes. Unlike the Benrinnes 23, this is aged bourbon hogshead. The color is incredibly pale in comparison.   Nose: Citrus, pear, some honey and tropical fruit. Muted in comparison.   Taste: Sweet and chewy. Coffee and dark chocolate, with lemon and notes of honey making an appearance again.   Finish:  Soft finish that stays with you for awhile. Apples and soft spices. Well rounded, though not as deep or flavorful as the 23. Warming.   Rating: 88   The Cadenhead’s Benrinnes is a very good whiskey. It is light, sweet with a good depth of flavor. The Benrinnes 23 is the best whiskey I have ever tasted. The sherry aging has created something amazing. Wine aged and finished scotches are a personal treat, and this is a perfect example of how good they can really be. This is a pricey bottle in Canada, but I am damn tempted to get one."

I will agree, Benrinnes Sherry do usually have a bigger depth of flavour than Bourbon Benrinnes. That said, we both gave roughly the same score for the Cadenhead's, so I should love the 23 when I get the chance."

The only other whiskies I've tried that compared are Benrinnes 14 AD Rattray and GlenDronach Single Cask PX Puncheon, both of which I sent you samples of!   If you haven't finish the entire Benrinnes 23 sample, I'd recommend trying it blind against the two above, and maybe GlenDronach Cask Strength and your Single Cask PX Puncheon too."

So, the same bourbon vs. sherry cask aging, but much younger.    I still have half the sample of the Benrinnes 23. Though it was hard not to drink the whole thing at once. I may do a blind tasting of many of the sherry aged/finished whiskies that I have.   I really wish the Benrinnes 23 did not cost $400 here."
Scotch,3d7eoz,LetThereBeR0ck,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:09:57 2015 UTC,"Poor Hart brothers, they don't stand a chance! Benrinnes 14 is perhaps the only scotch that I am completely confident that I can identify from the nose alone. In every blind tasting of sherried scotches that I've done, I picked it out purely on the nose, including the one where I was trying it for the first time.  $400 is steep. I got it for $230, and that makes it solidly the most expensive bottle I've purchased."
Scotch,3d7eoz,124876720,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:27:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at $230 I would go for it. $400 is a little high, especially considering other options. Ontario just had a clearance sale on Amrut PX for $70. So, ~6 bottles of Amrut PX Sherry, or 1 Benrinnes 23. Sadly the Benrinnes would lose out on that."
Scotch,3d75hh,Ethanized,6,Tue Jul 14 01:22:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks go out to /u/BourbonScotchWhiskey for the Glenfiddich 18 sample!  Per the usual, Glenfiddich 18 sample was tasted blind initially, with notes in italics added during the second (revealed) tasting if I found anything important. The Glenlivet 18 was NOT tasted blind.     Glenfiddich 18yr – 40%    Category Notes    Setup: Neat, INAO, rested 20 minutes.   Color: Chestnut.   Nose: It’s a scotch, though I didn’t pick that up as on some others. Light and fruity nose. Makes me think or rum-cake, actually. It’s quite nice, but I just finished sampling the OFBB which makes the sweetness a little overbearing. Pears come through on the second taste, along with some mango. 26/30   Taste: Yummy. It’s a very good combination of warmth, fruit, and sweet pastry. Really makes me think of a middle-eastern pastry made with a dried apricot preserve. Nice and fruity, like peach cobbler. 27/30   Body: Medium body, very light warmth, mostly on the tip of the tongue. 7/10   Finish: The heat lingers for a second on the front of the tongue, but fades quickly elsewhere. The flavors are pleasant, but I miss the heft of a higher-proof dram. Very fruity finish, not horribly sweet or bitter. 24/30   Score: 84/100   Value: 2/5 @ $80 for 750ml       Glenlivet 18yr - 43%    Category Notes    Setup: Neat, INAO, rested 20 minutes.   Color: Also chestnut.   Nose: A little bit earthy, banana chips, mango, ripe apricots. Very fruity, but with a more earthy note compared to the Fiddich. 26/30   Taste: Dried fruit – mangoes and bananas. A touch of spice, a little blood orange. 26/30   Body: A tinge of sharp heat hits for a second, then clears out. Light and clear after that. 6/10   Finish: The flavors and light warmth linger a minute. Very mild, and clean, actually refreshing after the Fiddich’s bitterness. 26/30   Score: 84/100   Value: 2/5 @ $80 for 750ml (5 = must buy; 4 = good buy; 3 = priced right; 2 = overpriced; 1 = avoid).      Average score to date: 83     Yes – it’s a tie, and if you’ve ever read NFL QB’s on Facebook, you know what they say about ties. These two are similar and yet different. The Fiddich is more flavorful, but has the downside of that fruit bitterness on the finish. The Livet is more crisp and clean, but on the other hand it’s not as complex. Both are fine malts, but neither is worth the $80 price tag considering other options in that price range. Unless you’re showing off, save $30 and grab either of the 15yr expressions if you just want an easy drinking, fruity scotch."

I see that said over and over again with respect to sherry casks; that the sherry itself isn't having the effect, it's the European oak. Obviously I have my doubts about this sentiment, but if this experiment adds peat, it nullifies their argument.  Edit: Jesus people... read what I wrote. I'm not saying I agree with this statement.

Glenmorangie owns an entire forest in the Ozarks just to protect the trees that they like to use in their barrels.   The wood does have an effect, but the previous contents also have an effect. Hell, the air around the barrel has an effect. The placement in the warehouse has an effect. I'd be willing to bet that the sulfur contents of the warehouse workers' farts has an effect too."

Scotch,3d4vm1,Lasidar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:06:49 2015 UTC,I don't think they're talking about whether a sherry cask adds sherry but whether the finish and the additional aging does a good job.  +sherry is ???? but +sherry & +awesome barrel is amazing.
Scotch,3d4vm1,slanderousu,3,Mon Jul 13 15:56:47 2015 UTC,"I've heard numerous times someone ask an industry professional whether sherry notes in a sherried whisky come from the previous cask contents, or the wood itself. The answer always given is that it's the wood. My only point is that can't be the case if a cask that previously held peated contents is giving a non-peated whisky peat notes."
Scotch,3d4vm1,Lasidar,2,Mon Jul 13 16:04:13 2015 UTC,Of course it can because the wood is carrying the peat.  Maybe we're getting cables crossed here.  When a company buys a cask with a finish in it the barrel's wood is holding a LOT of the previous whisky in it.  That's primarily what is finishing the whisky.  There's also some peated whisky sitting in the barrel that wasn't completely dumped out sometimes too.  That doesn't have half as much impact as what is stored in the barrel itself.  That sounds more like the conversation you read/hear was saying but maybe I'm misunderstanding.
Scotch,3d4vm1,slanderousu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:06:56 2015 UTC,"No, trust me, I agree with you completely. I was just pointing out that the industry experts who claim otherwise are obviously wrong."

Scotch,3d4vm1,mapolo29,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:27:49 2015 UTC,I believe you miss understand their answers.    European oak and in many cases Spanish oak gives you many of the Sherry notes.    Just like American white oak tends to give you the vanilla and nutty notes.    Yes the Sherry gives you some flavor also but have you ever had a young oloroso Sherry?  It's not sweet.    The point is that the wood is the driving factor followed by the contents.    Both play a role. This is why you get different flavors if it French oak vs Spanish oak vs American oak.    Hell American oak is a poor term because of the different types of white oak used.    It's also why it does not matter if the ex bourbon cask was from Jack or makers.    Both use high quality casks and both sell their casks after 4-6 yrs.      I've sat down with a few master blenders and had this conversion.    Another intresting things is that scotch does not oxidize in the bottle like many people think.    Different chemical process are going on.   Buts that's another conversion.
Scotch,3d4vm1,Lasidar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:14:08 2015 UTC,"Of course it's both the wood and the previous contents.  Think about it for a second.

Nose: grassy... alcohol, malt, grass, and light floral notes.    Taste: hot & bitter... bourbon and honey.    Finish: nutty... malt, cashew, almond, peanut butter. A little too oily.    Conclusions: That nuttiness in the finish is nice, making it rather Cardhu-esque, Bunnahabahin-y, or Pulteney-ish. It gets positive points for being a warming cask-strengther as well, but some minus points because I liked it less and less the more I sipped it. Middling, but fine for the ABV. 79/100"

Scotch,3d3zaz,treydog9999,6,Mon Jul 13 09:47:42 2015 UTC,"This review #2 is for Talisker Storm NAS bottled at 45.8 % ABV 70cl. This was an already opened bottle. Talisker is a Diageo brand and from the Isle of Skye. Storm is one of the ""flavour"" based releases with NAS along with Skye, Dark Storm (matured in heavily charred casks), and Port Ruighe (port finish).    Tasted in Copita Nosing Glass Neat.   Appearance: Amber / Amber -0.5 . Medium beads coming down at a relatively slow speed for a NAS. I would guess they are using something in the 8-10 year range for this. Nose:  Really clear salt and smoke notes. There is some briny wood, with some sweeter notes of honey. But the sweetness comes later. Taste: Honey, vanilla, smoked salt, salted caramel. You really are getting an island flavor coming out. But the balance between salt and sweet is really well done. Not cloyingly sweet or overly briny/iodine. Finish: Salty sea air, briny finish. This had a really clear and distinct finish that was very pleasant. No bitterness or burn. Conclusion: This is a very solid whisky. Great balance of honey caramel sweet flavors with marine salt and smoke. Score: 90/100"

I thought it was far too much smoke taste for my liking.  I prefer the 10 and distiller's edition.  Also, speaking of the finish, I could taste this for several hours afterwards.  I'd much rather have a peated scotch in the vein of Lagulavin, Laphroaig, or Ardberg.  To each his own though."

So obviously Ardbeg is one of my favourite distilleries (let's just ignore the little hiccup that was perpetuum and hope it doesn't happen again). A few weeks ago one of the big whisky bloggers here in Israel (This is his blog) said he'd be having a tasting of Ardbeg special releases, so I was there like a shot. The tasting was held at a Bavarian pub, one of the owners is a big whisky fan and gourmet chef, so there was some excellent food too.  The lineup was as follows: Ardbeg 10, Uigeadail, Alligator, Galileo, Ardbog and Auriverdes. The 10 and the oogie were provided by Glenmo's importer here (they don't supply Corry yet, but they just took over the brand from a very shitty importer and have already dropped prices to a reasonable level, so hopefully they will soon), the special releases were from said bloggers personal collection. I didn't take notes for the 10 and the Oogie as I've reviewed them before on here. Also forgive me but no notes on Alcohol percentages, but all cask strength, NCA, NCF.  Ardbeg Alligator   Nose: Salty vanilla toffee. Glace cherries. Cinnamon. Funky (mix of herbal and earthy) peat. Woody vanilla.  Palate:  Boiled sweets. Tobacco,fresh. Bitter licorice. Woodspice. Mineral peat. Seaweed. Leather.  Finish:  Long. Bitter wood. Mineral peat. Salt. Dried apricots    Rating: 9/10  Ardbeg Galileo   Nose: Sweet glue. Honey. White Grape juice. Little smoke.  Palate:  Caramelised apples. Cashew. White dessert wine. Sweet cherries.  Finish:  Long. Brown sugar. Maple syrup. Orange nectar.   Rating: 6/10 (Oi! This is girl whisky, where the f**k is my peat?!)  Ardbeg Ardbog   Nose: Dirty, sulphury sherry. Mineral peat. Red fruits. Goji berries. Sticky wood. Vanilla. Peanuts. Caramel pudding  Palate:  Salty nuts. Sweet peat. Dry sherry and dry wood. Treacle. Finish:  Long. Dry wood and wood smoke with some hints of sherry.    Rating: 10/10 (Got lost in this for a while)  Ardbeg Auriverdes   Nose: Ash. Toffee. Bitter coffee. Good tobacco smoke.  Palate:  Salty toffee. Mineral peat. Dry wood. Cinnamon.  Finish:  Long. Very salty. Dry wood. Cinnamon.    Rating: 8/10  So apparently Ardbeg makes mistakes every so often (side-eyeing Galileo), but on the whole they make some solid stuff. I really liked the Ardbog, kind of like the Oogie kicked up a notch. The 10 was actually also one of my favourites as I just really like the regular Ardbeg profile. To be honest if they'd just release the 3 core expressions they'd do great. Awesome evening all in all."
Scotch,3d3g9o,GeneralHoondite,2,Mon Jul 13 05:29:44 2015 UTC,You nailed my exact thoughts on Galileo. Didn't care for it at all.  The brief sample I had of Ardbog though made me want a lot more. Found it sitting somewhere between Uig and Corry.  Nice write up.

Nose: Sherry influence is huge. Grape, fruit punch, pineapple, cherry, sugar coated strawberries, brown sugar, clove, toffee. Incredible!  Taste: Grape jam, loaded with tropical fruits, fruit punch, tannic, baking spices, red berries, caramel and just the right amount of sugary sweetness.

Scotch,3d2z5w,Suck_It_Trebek,8,Mon Jul 13 02:48:49 2015 UTC,"Review #37: Glenlivet Nadurra 16 Year  Glenlivet 12 was one of the single malts that ushered me into my whisky habit.  When I heard the age stated Nadurra – one of the most highly praised drams on this sub – was going away, I decided to grab a bottle.  Nose:  Malt, barley cereal, white grapes, white grape juice, freshly cut yard clippings, sweet cream, white chocolate fondue, nougat, dulce de leche caramel, huge amount of vanilla, some stewed apples and pears, wildflowers, and some faint star anise.  Wow, this nose is awesome.  This reminds me of summer dessert dishes at small pubs in the Cotswolds.  Palate:  Thick, monstrously oily.  Huge burst of milk chocolate, nougat, and dulce de leche caramel with vanilla.  Clotted cream.  Malted vanilla milkshake, and stewed pears with fresh cream.  Then some sweet, creamy liquorice.  Very creamy, very sweet, delicious.  Finish:  Long, warming.  There’s a lovely sweet wildflower note coupled with some bitter oak that linger on the palate for damn ever, and then some vanilla baking in an oven with confectioner’s sugar, and some fresh blueberries.  The Verdict: This is delicious whisky, and totally unexpected.  I am underwhelmed by the 12-, 15-, and 18-year offerings that Glenlivet puts out, but this is aqua vitae.  I was surprised by how little fruit I found in this, instead getting a profile of refined and cooked sugars.  Also, this thing is a vanilla bomb, in a good way.  Grab a bottle of this if you see it, it’s a fucking travesty that they are replacing it. Score: 87.5/100"

When it's first released use decent old stocks. Gain a reputation as a good whiskey. Over time cheapen it up and profit till people figure it out.  Repeat.
Scotch,3d2z5w,slanderousu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:15:20 2015 UTC,"Judging by the terrible initial reviews of the sherry NAS Nadurra on this sub, they skipped step 1 and went straight to profiting from cask strength nerds. [sarcasm]I blame the French.[/sarcasm]"
Scotch,3d2z5w,AnonymousGunNut,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:43:35 2015 UTC,"They make less money selling the 16 Nadurra at 56% than they would as the 15 at 40 or 18 at 43%. It's business, plain and simple.   A bottle of Nadurra 16 here in California goes for 55 to 60, so about a dollar per percentage point of alcohol. Meanwhile the 15 (Yes I know the standard uses french casks but they have a duty free bourbon 15) is 45 dollars for 40% and one year younger than the Nadurra.  Assuming an average cask strength of 56%, of a 42 gallon bourbon barrel, subtracting angel's share of about 32% for 16 years yields 143 American 75cl bottles of Nadurra 16.  At $55 a bottle, that barrel becomes $7800 of juice.  Watering it down to 40% after 30% angel's share yields 205 75cl bottles of 15 year.  At $45 a bottle that same barrel aged one year less is $9225.  The company loses roughly $1,400 along with having to wait a year each time a barrel becomes Nadurra 16 instead of standard 15.  Watering it down to 43% after 36% angel's share yields 175 75cl bottles of 18 year.   At $76 a bottle, that barrel aged two years more is $13,300. The company increases the revenue from that barrel $5,500 by not bottling it as Nadurra 16 but instead as 18 year.  Unless Nadurra's price goes up (EDIT:an averaging of the cask prices of the 15 and 18 has yielded $80 as a conservatively plausible intermediate) to reflect that it's cask strength and a year older than the 15, it's a terrible business practice to continue selling it at that price, and the bean counters at Pernod Ricard have decided to kill it rather than risk a price increase that torpedoes demand and leaves unsellable stock. As a businessman, I can't blame them, but as a fan of Nadurra 16, I still resent it."
Scotch,3d2z5w,thedersy1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:40:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get how they make more money on lower proofed offerings.  They're still going to be making NAS Nadurra at cask strength and in at least three different varieties that I am aware of - and at a higher price point which they could do with Nadurra 16 should they so desire.  Presumably they're going for younger stock to save older stock, as you indicate, for more cash.  All you really had to say was ""for older stock"" because I am aware that they underproof their entire line."

Scotch,3czwaf,Rallerboy888,6,Sun Jul 12 08:11:34 2015 UTC,"Hullo chaps!  Welcome to my 23rd review of a fine Scottish single malt whisky. Now, I am a bit of a sucker for Talisker. I have tried a few of their expressions: Storm (meh, simple smoke), 10 y/o (punchy, good value), 18 y/o (delicate, perfected). I felt like something was missing, though. After trying some peated malts with wine-finishes (Bowmore 15 Darkest, BenRiach Solstice, stuff) I wanted some Talisker featuring the same treats. I found the port-finished Talisker expression, the Port Ruighe [Port Ree], on sale, and immediately snagged it. Is it any good? Let's see! Skål!    Talisker Port Ruighe, 45.8%, CF, E150, NAS    Nose Salt, ripe stone fruits, pears, coastal peat, soot, rubber Huh... This is a bit strange to decipher. I feel like I'm missing something on the nose, but I can't tell why. The spirit is not really in your face - in spite of the youth and abv - but it isn't particularly refined either.  Taste: Hot, salty, funky (DAE Springbank? xD xD), coastal peat, apple, berries, dry, full. It's slightly hot, though I decided to not add water. Letting it rest for 10 minutes helped it settle down. If feel like the port is not pronounced enough, and that it merely mutes the kick that is usually delivered by Talisker. It's fairly full-bodied, not oily like Octomore, but not thin like thin stuff either.  Finish: Long, dry, salty. Exactly what is to be expected from Talisker. It's rather dry, and full. The characteristic Talisker salted peat lingers on the palate and in the throat for quite a while.    I'll be honest, I had expected more from this. There is so much potential in this, and I feel like it has gone to waste. The finishing in port pipes has been done sloppily, and not for a long enough time. A shame, quite frankly. I would love to see this in the style of Longrow RED; matured fully in port pipes, cask strength, and no stupid filtering. Damn that'd be good. I'll be sticking to the 10 for now. Hopefully I can snag a bottle of the DE for a decent price sometime.     84/100    Thanks for popping by!"

Scotch,3czwaf,Ethanized,2,Sun Jul 12 09:25:45 2015 UTC,"Cheers!  The pear notes were somewhat similar to Glenfiddich 12. Not very pronounced, though not difficult to spot either. The berries were really the only influence from the port cask. I always write notes in the order I decipher them FWIW."

In the right corner, we have PC 10yr, coming to the arena by way of /u/Johnysteaks! Gentlemen, thank you for your contributions.  Per the usual, the sample was tasted blind initially, with notes in italics added during the second (revealed) tasting if I found anything important.     Bruichladdich Port Charlotte 10yr Peated – 46%    Category Notes    Setup: Neat, INAO, rested 20 minutes.   Color: Pale gold.   Nose: Very peat forward. I start to pick out some fruit as the dram airs out a bit, but the peat is definitely the main course here. Second time around it’s primarily fruit: mangoes, pears, bananas. The peat comes back after the glass empties.  27/30   Taste: Goddamn! Papaya and cigar tobacco leaf hit me like a truck. It might sound like a strange combination but I found it quite exhilarating. It’s a really interesting flavor. 27/30   Body: Mild warmth, light body. 7/10   Finish: I hate to say it, but the finish is rather weak – fades far too quickly with no real warmth. I’m a little disappointed. The next sip builds up the finish a little more and I start to enjoy it more. It still fades quickly but recovers a couple of points here. The nice thing is that the sweetness and bitterness are in perfect balance – the two neutralizing each other. 26/30   Score: 87/100   Value: 3/5 @ $55 (retail) for 750ml (5 = must buy; 4 = good buy; 3 = priced right; 2 = overpriced; 1 = avoid).       Bruichladdich Port Charlotte – An Turas Mor – 46%    Category Notes    Setup: Neat, INAO, rested 20 minutes.   Color: Deep gold.   Nose: Balanced peat – not too sweet nor meaty, just kind of in the middle. I pick up some rum and brandy notes the second time around. 26/30   Taste: Sweet and peaty. Way more sweetness here than the nose would indicate, with tropical fruit coming through. 25/30   Body: Light, with just a hint of warmth that doesn’t fully develop until the finish. 7/10   Finish: A little light, but the flavors persist a bit longer than the warmth. The warmth is just about perfect – setting the taste buds tingling but not getting in the way of the flavor. 25/30   Score: 83/100   Value: 2/5 @ $55 (retail) for 750ml (5 = must buy; 4 = good buy; 3 = priced right; 2 = overpriced; 1 = avoid).       Average score to date: 83     So I did enjoy the PC10 more than the Scottish Barley – I really liked that cigar leaf flavor, it complements the fruit profile really well. The ATM was a little bit of a disappointment, as it was too lightly peated and a bit too sweet for my palate as it stands. Both are otherwise fine whiskeys. My scores for them falls just about in line with my preferences: PC10 > Scottish Barley  > An Turas Mor."

Scotch,3cyvzu,HawkI84,14,Sun Jul 12 01:06:35 2015 UTC,"This is a non-age stated version of Talisker that’s pushing cask strength. The name comes from the latitude that the Isle of Skye is on. Talisker is one of United Distillers (a predecessor of Diageo’s) “Classic Malts” lineup, representing the islands region. The others in the lineup are Lagavulin, Oban, Dalwhinnie, Cragganmore, and Glenkinchie.  57% abv.  Nose - Lots of honey, an herbal note that reminds me most of oregano (I get this with every Talisker I’ve had not called Talisker Storm), plenty of pepper, vanilla, raw ginger, sawdust, oak smoke, ocean breeze. Rather spicy neat. Has almost as many savory elements as it does sweet. Water dials back the sweetness, and brings out something reminiscent of firewood (before it’s burning).  Taste - An intense sweet-salty note to start, like a brine that has plenty of honey in it. As it develops, the herbs and spices start to come more in to play - ginger, lots of black pepper again, oregano, the bark from bbq that took a bit too much oak smoke, lemon. Medium-plus body - rather big, but not up there with some of the big barrel proof bruisers of the bourbon world. Water again tones down the sweetness, and brings out a drying woody note.  Finish - Honey, vanilla, smoke, a hint of lemon, with the black pepper crescendo-ing quite a bit in a way that’s a hallmark of Talisker. Less spice here with water.  I think this is my favorite Talisker I've had. It doesn’t have the refinement of the 18 (I haven’t had the 25), but what it lacks in subtlety it makes up for by having its strong suits come through in a really big way. I get more sweetness and spice with this one than I do other versions, which is right up my alley. I prefer this neat despite the strength.  90/100"

It doesn’t have the refinement of the 18 (I haven’t had the 25), but what it lacks in subtlety it makes up for by having its strong suits come through in a really big way. I get more sweetness and spice with this one than I do other versions, which is right up my alley. I prefer this neat despite the heat.   Nailed it.  This is also my favorite Talisker.  It's like the 10 on steroids, yet still different.  Really good."
Scotch,3cyvzu,scotch3gg,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:50:54 2015 UTC,Great review and same feelings I have.  Can't find one in my area to save my life though...
Scotch,3cz1yd,onePun,3,Sun Jul 12 02:06:27 2015 UTC,"Talisker Distiller’s Edition 2013 (45.8% abv) ($68)  Color: amber  Nose: sherry, chocolate, pepper, raisins, honey, peat  Taste: peat, sherry, pepper, smoke, cherry, chocolate  Finish: pepper, smoke, peat, iodine  Overall: 91/100  I really enjoy Talisker 10 and think it is one of the better values out there. That’s why I decided to pick the Distiller’s Edition for only $8 more. The Distiller’s Edition was aged 11 years and double matured in Amoroso sherry casks. This looks much darker than most 11 year scotches, so I would not be surprised if it has color added, but it could just be the sherry casks. On the nose, this is much sweeter than Talisker 10. The sherry influence definitely makes a difference, but there is still a peppery smokiness still in the background. In the mouth, the vegetal peat flavor is at the forefront giving way to rich cornucopia of flavors including fruit, chocolate, and sherry. This is much more complex than the Talisker 10 ad less smokey. The finish is long and brings forward the peppery smoke typical of Talisker. I’m always amazed at how long the finish in Talisker lingers for its abv. I really like this dram and will be picking up any future editions I see, . Just like Talisker 10, it is a great value, but it is way more complex than that dram. Unlike some other sherry finishes, the sweet sherry does not dominate. Instead, it complements the usually peppery Talisker more. The smoke was also stronger when I opened this bottle a couple of months ago, and I feel it has improved since I opened it. If you see a bottle of this, grab it.  Also, mods tartan please!"

Scotch,3cygb7,Daft_Hunk,9,Sat Jul 11 22:35:41 2015 UTC,"Hello Scotchit!  Last year I was one of the lucky few who happened to be at Balvenie on the day of the release of the Tun 1509 Batch #1. We’d known there was something in the pipelines for quite some time, however it was purely coincidental that I happened to be there the morning the first bottles hit the shelves. You can find that review here.  I wasn’t quite as close to the release date this time, however as you can see from the fill level of the bottle, I wasn’t exactly far off either.   The Tun 1401, the predecessor to the 1509, is yet to be knocked off its pedestal as my favourite Scotch of all time. A marriage of casks from 21 to 46 years old, the stuff is simply glorious, select literally any review from the database and you’ll see I’m not alone with that opinion either. So as I’m sure you can imagine, I had high hopes for batch #1 of the 1509, hopes which sadly weren’t met. Nevertheless, I’m sure they’ll it right second time ‘round.     Colour: Light Gold  Nose: Apricot marmalade, juniper berries, raspberry cordial, fresh ginger, slight oak and a significant helping of parmesan cheese. A baffling combination of sweet and savoury.   Palate: Floral honey, blueberries, ginger cake, French toast, olive oil, nutmeg and pine nuts. As with the first batch, the oak is almost undetectable.   Mouthfeel: Quite thin for a 50% whisky, sharp and clean rather than thick and oily.  Finish: Vanilla extract, aniseed, toffee, leather, slight, pepper, heavy tannin and oak. The oak finally makes an appearance however is overpowered by an almost astringent bitterness.    Comparing the 1509 Batch #1 to the 1401, I couldn’t help but feel there was a rather significant drop in the overall quality of the whisky. It felt bourbon heavy, younger and generally lacked character. I’m saddened to say the same can be said when it comes to Batch #2, in fact, even more so.  Throughout there’s a rather odd combination of sweet and savoury, a combination that I don’t think quite works. It’s also quite obviously bourbon heavy, with little to no sherry influence. Whereas the first batch was still a good dram even with its faults, I find this to be simply ok at best. The 15yo single barrels are better whiskies and at a quarter of a price, there’s simply no comparison. I think my interest in the 1509 has come to an end. Disappointing. 84/100"

Scotch,3cy6y3,bitwaba,3,Sat Jul 11 23:24:27 2015 UTC,"you need to get it out now.  Pour all of it out of the bottle into a glass or a bowl or something.  You'll need to strain the pieces of cork out.  If you have a tea strainer that would probably work best.  Once you've got all the cork filtered out, funnel the whisky into another glass bottle or if you were able to get all the cork out of the Laga bottle, then just funnel it back in there.  You're going to need another cork though.  You can probably come up with something makeshift though."

Scotch,3cy6y3,dustlesswalnut,2,Sat Jul 11 23:35:34 2015 UTC,"Its a common topic that comes up here somewhat regularly (not what happens once the cork is in the bottle... just 'help, what do i do!?!' )  Im not sure what happens molecularly, but the general consensus around here is you've got about 24 hours before it begins to severely effect the taste.  Might be worth a crosspost to /r/askscience"
Scotch,3cy6y3,quercus_robur,2,Sat Jul 11 23:56:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  I call bunk on the 24 hours (qualified below).  The topic has frequently come up in terms of not lying bottles on their side because it can degrade the cork and compromise the seal.  If the cork is tainted with TCA, you could also get the wet cardboard flavor of ""corked"" wine.  However, if that's not the case (which, granted, there's no way of knowing in advance), I would expect the cork to taste flavorless.  I also wouldn't expect it to disintegrate completely.  Maybe I will start an experiment with vodka and cork..."
Scotch,3cy6y3,dustlesswalnut,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:38:28 2015 UTC,"I'm hesitant to say anything bad would happen. Alcohol doesn't eat away cork, it just dries it out. I've got a 27y Bunnahabhain thats had cork floaties in it since day one with zero ill effects.  I still try to fish cork bits out of the bottle but... Eh. Just an aesthetics thing for me."
Scotch,3cy6y3,quercus_robur,3,Sun Jul 12 00:03:48 2015 UTC,"That's what I would expect.  It compromises the seal of the bottle, but I wouldn't expect ill effects. (if the cork isn't tainted with TCA--which approximately 10% of corks are)"
Scotch,3cy6y3,dustlesswalnut,4,Sun Jul 12 00:26:47 2015 UTC,"Even then-- does TCA survive in high alcohol contents like whisky? (Honest question.)  I hear the ""alcohol dissolves cork"" parroted a lot but that doesn't make any sense. Why would producers seal a bottle with something that dissolves on contact with the thing it's sealing?"
Scotch,3cy6y3,microcline,3,Sun Jul 12 00:34:33 2015 UTC,"I assume TCA is a stable chemical, otherwise it wouldn't last long in cork.  Presumably even if it does hydrolyze, oxidize, or something else, its byproducts still taste offensive.  But I agree with you.  Sounds like a perpetuated myth, like so many other things.  (Different areas of your tongue taste different tastes!)"
Scotch,3cy6y3,dustlesswalnut,2,Sun Jul 12 00:40:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know why, but I thought it was a fungus.  But yeah, some bits of healthy cork in the bottle wine affect a whisky any more than the barrel bits floating in unfiltered whiskies."

No seriously, it smells exactly like my buddy Joey's house. Weird. Warm peat, some vanilla sneaks in as well. This is almost earthy or musty. Very pleasant after a while  Palate: Peat right upfront, succeeded by creamy vanilla and a smokey, woody note. Some strawberry and candy flavors as well.

I held onto it and read some mixed reviews, but I can proudly say I am damn glad I bought this. I can't remember the price but I doubt I paid over $60-$70 for it, which in my book is reasonable especially since I like the little store.

Scotch,3cyt3m,peon2,7,Sun Jul 12 00:37:20 2015 UTC,"Has nothing to do with amino acids.  It has to do with how alcohol bonds to aroma molecules in high proof solutions.  Water gets in between the alcohol and aroma molecule, allowing the aroma to escape, thereby opening the nose.  Even in a solution of 40-50% alcohol, the alcohol isn't evenly dispersed.  The alcohol molecules bunch up and surround other organic molecules, and the water bunches up separately.  As you lower the proof, there are less alcohol molecules to bunch up."
Scotch,3cyt3m,quercus_robur,2,Sun Jul 12 00:45:52 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks for correcting me and as you say a source would be great, but any scientific explanation is appreciated."
Scotch,3cyt3m,quercus_robur,2,Sun Jul 12 00:52:52 2015 UTC,"BTW, it may take more than a few drops of water--there is nothing magical about a few drops.  Depending on how much scotch you're starting with and its original proof, I would add half a teaspoon of water, wait 5 minutes, smell, and then add additional half teaspoon fulls, waiting 5 minutes between each addition (perhaps with the glass covered).  Then you can discover for yourself the effects of water, which will be different with each whisky.  And it's not just that more aromas come out as you add water, but you may find different aromas at different times along the dilution, depending on when different aromas each escape from the solution and the effect of oxidization on the aromas.  It's best to try this experiment starting with an unchillfiltered cask-strength scotch as you slowly bring it down to around 35-40% yourself.  For example, try Aberlour A'bunadh."
Scotch,3cyt3m,quercus_robur,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:00:37 2015 UTC,"Interesting, and its funny you mentioned Aberlour A'bunadh as I tried this with Aberlour 12 year the other day (drinking it neat, and then with water) and didn't notice a difference myself. This could be I don't really have the sense of it or I didn't wait the 5 minutes as you suggested but I'll try it with the A'bunadh I suppose.  If this helps with your suggestions I can tell you I've only tried a few single malts, namely  12 yr Balvenie double wood  14 yr Balvenie carribbean cask  12 yr Glen Dronach  12 yr Bowmore  12 yr Macallan  12 yr Aberlour  That's about it as far as I can recall, idk if your suggestion would be more meaningful for different scotches or not (again, sorry for the ignorance) but any suggestion is helpful."

Scotch,3cw0a1,thedersy1,3,Sat Jul 11 06:17:25 2015 UTC,"The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 year old  Single Malt Scotch Whisky  thedersy1’s third review    43% ABV  Served into a glencairn, neat and water added later.  Color: Gold  Nose: Rich fruits, vanilla, hint of pepper, little bit of spiciness and heat on the nose. With water some delicate floral notes arise from amongst the fruit and spice.  Palate: Sherry up front. Syrupy fruits, vanilla and butterscotch. Lightly oily mouthfeel that seems to be common among sherried whiskies I've had. I don't think the palate on this holds up that well to the addition of water. It seems to kind of blur the lines between a lot of these various sweet flavor notes.  Finish: Short-Medium, drying finish. There's a level of peppery spice that appears in the finish that decreases the longer it rests. With the addition of water the spice almost completely disappears and the finish seems to extend a little bit.  Development: After resting for a little bit the bourbon influences begin to take a back seat to the sherry. While the butterscotch and vanilla flavors remain they seem to meld together with the dark fruits and sherry sweetness. This is definitely more of a dessert whisky, I'd say.  82/100  I definitely agree, this is an awesome scotch for beginners. It is very middle of the road in terms of flavor, leaning a bit more heavily on the sherry side of things. It's unoffensive, although I have to say when I first tried this (what seems like ages ago now, even though it was maybe 4 months ago) the peppery kick hit me pretty hard and put me off for a bit. I tried this first as a part of a 5 part flight at a bar, and as time went on and the spirit mellowed out I found myself liking it better than the rest of the ones I tried that night (Macallan 12, Glenlivet 12, Glenfiddich 12, and Cardhu 12). This is definitely a spirit that benefits from resting a few minutes.  Originally bought this at $46 for a bottle. Would I buy this again? No, not even at $40. Why? Not because it isn't good, but because it isn't nearly as exciting or challenging as I'd like. It's mellow and enjoyable, but so are a lot of cheap blends and bourbons, and at the price I'd much rather reach for a bottle of Glenfarclas 12 (review to come eventually). I respect the DoubleWood for holding the door open for myself and many others that were just beginning their malt journeys, but alas it must stay at the door and hold it open, and I don't plan on hanging out by the door all night.    What’s to come: Going to try and review things in the order I received them, what comes next is: Macallan 12, Jura Collection (Jura 10yr Origin, Superstition, Diurach's Own 16yr), Glenlivet Nadurra 16 year old, Bunnahabhain 12, and Glenfarclas 12 (this one will be quite a ways away). Until next time, cheers!  Edit: Going to start tallying metrics!  Average Score: 79  Standard Deviation: 3"

Scotch,3cw4b9,shane_il,4,Sun Jul 12 06:05:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the premise that the 2008 American recession lead to a decrease in bourbon demand. On the contrary, bourbon production has increased by 150% since 1999. We love to drink more when life is depressing.  Instead, I would look to the increased demand for sour and barrel aged beer as a possible driver for the cask shortage. The other thing that stuck out in that link was the increased demand for premium bourbon. In other words, the producers are leaving a higher percentage of the total produced to age longer, resulting in fewer empty casks to send abroad."
Scotch,3cw4b9,Pole420,2,Sat Jul 11 23:43:47 2015 UTC,"I've read the magic number of a 1 million cask shortage in the upcoming years (for Scotland). It makes sense.

Scotch,3cw4b9,noblecustom,2,Sat Jul 11 14:37:34 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. I posted before about stocking up and the reasons behind it. The main counter argument was that many distillers are expanding and new distillate will flood the market keeping prices down in the face of rising demand. However, this article shows why this argument is folly. Simply adding new distillate only means more whiskey of very questionable quality and age given the inability and/or higher cost to properly age it. I'm inspired now to redouble my buying."

It was obviously taxing, but Nick was gracious and affable to everyone. My wife and I were in the last 40 or so (out of prob 300), and when I got to the signing table, I explained to Mr. Offerman that it had always been a ""bucket list kind of thing"" that I might buy him a glass of Lagavulin one day, if I ever met him. So, I told him, instead I brought some with me. I pulled out a bottle of Lag 12. He appeared suddenly intrigued – having signed his book for over 2 hours – and asked me, ""Well, do you have any glasses?"" I did.    I poured both of us a small glass and toasted him. As he took his drink, he jokingly shouted to the crowd, ""the signing is over!"" He was very funny and kind. Seemed to genuinely appreciate the gesture.

Scotch,3ctabz,cjotto9,5,Fri Jul 10 16:28:05 2015 UTC,"Springbank 12 Year Old Claret Cask Finish - 54.4%, $100  Nose: Sweet fruit wine, light smoke, classic Springbank Campbeltown tang and brine.  Taste: Caramel fruit, peat smoke, Campbeltown tang, salty. Full mouthfeel.  Finish: Raisin shows up as does malt toast. It fades to a dry smoky malt. Medium long length.   Notes: I’ve had several of these small special cask releases and this is a very nice one, although I’ve not had a bad one really. What I do love about Springbank is that not only do they tell you how long it’s been finished, 3 years in this case, but they typically will finish it for a few years not just a couple months.  88/100"

Notes: Wow is all I can say. I had a taste of the 2.1 back several years ago and didn’t care for it too much but this blew me away.

Scotch,3ctj62,jmanc62,11,Fri Jul 10 17:33:22 2015 UTC,"NAS whiskies are both a blessing and a curse for distilleries.  I've probably said most of this in several other threads but what the hay.    Sure, it helps them manage supply better and it helps them keep higher age statements on the shelf.  I doubt most master distillers would intentionally make a lesser product just because they now have free license on age.  However, that doesn't prevent the company from pressuring them into it.    The freedom distillers now love with the NAS is an invitation for shareholders to demand greater volume for lower prices and over-riding the master distiller's own values - see the recent Perpetuum Ardbeg leak.    However, on top of that issue, the company is going to find it harder to market NAS products because the new NAS product labels have no inherent advertising value.  The age statements acted, more or less, as free advertisement in a way.  A guarantee of quality - much like the Bottled-in-Bond movement in the US post-prohibition.  With those pesky age statements out of the way companies are going to have a hard time distinguishing new products for new customers.  That's my take on it anyway."
Scotch,3ctj62,slanderousu,2,Fri Jul 10 17:55:35 2015 UTC,Ardbeg leak?
Scotch,3ctj62,Lashujin,5,Fri Jul 10 21:35:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm on mobile so I can't link you but a person at Ardbeg leaked that the master distiller was told to double Perpetuum output at the last minute despite the already too large batch size which resulted in using a lot of not-so-special barrels.  The leak isn't confirmed but Perpetuum as a product is a pretty big flop as far as flavor and special releases are concerned.  Tastes a lot like Ardbeg 10 so it seems the leak was accurate in result at the very least.
Scotch,3ctj62,slanderousu,8,Fri Jul 10 21:44:41 2015 UTC,I buy and promote the good ones and ignore the bad ones. You should all do the same. Just say 'no' to bad NAS releases!
Scotch,3ctj62,Razzafrachen,2,Fri Jul 10 17:35:40 2015 UTC,"Without a doubt but if you can crank out these new products more quickly - how do the company's rationalize the high prices. Again, maybe this is all in my head but when I know something has taken 10,15, 18, etc. years to create, I don't mind shelling out a couple greenbacks."
Scotch,3ctj62,Razzafrachen,7,Fri Jul 10 17:37:50 2015 UTC,"Not all NAS's have high prices. I get Uigeadail for $55 which is a tremendous value for a tasty NAS whisky.   In the end, I will pay for good whisky. Age statements are only a part of the equation. I've had some amazing 10yrs and some mediocre 18yr whiskies. Just provide me with good whisky at a reasonable price and I will buy it. If it's mediocre whisky at an inflated price, then I won't buy it and might even talk shit about your brand (I'm looking at you Macallan). Vote with your wallet and your mouth."
Scotch,3ctj62,Razzafrachen,2,Fri Jul 10 17:52:24 2015 UTC,I completely agree that Uigeadail is tasty but why do you believe you are receiving tremendous value. Merely because you like the taste (which by the way is absolutely acceptable answer)? I am just concerned that I am overpaying for a no age statement product.
Scotch,3ctj62,The_PharmASSIST,2,Fri Jul 10 19:47:04 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simple. I compare its flavor and distinctiveness to other whiskies in the same price range and it stands out as a very good value. I don't know what a whisky should be priced at based on technical details and production costs. If a company is able to create an amazing whisky cheaply and sell it for a big profit, good for them!"
Scotch,3ctj62,tvraisedme,2,Fri Jul 10 19:57:18 2015 UTC,"Companies rationalize high prices because they know people are willing to pay them.  You might not be getting much 'value' out of a $100 Ardbeg NAS bottle so to speak, but people are willing to buy that NAS bottle for $100 because its Ardbeg.  It's unfortunate that some companies are resorting to this, but it is however, successful marketing whether we like it or not.  Keep in mind however that some distilleries do a fine job with NAS releases (e.g. Quarter Cask).  NAS is not a guarantor of poor quality.  However, NAS DOES not guarantee any product age, which traditionally WAS a marker of 'quality'"
Scotch,3ctj62,delbin,5,Sat Jul 11 01:56:38 2015 UTC,"age doesn't always equate with quality. bad whisky is bad whisky. the problem is that if there's no age statement, you can rest assured it's probably going to have that young funk to it. bad age stated whisky is probably just going to underwhelming b/c of  poor blends, tired casks, etc"
Scotch,3ctj62,Rallerboy888,3,Fri Jul 10 19:13:30 2015 UTC,"I will miss the shorthand when looking a collection. I feel like I have to do more research when looking at something like Bunnahabhain Toiteach as to whether it fits between the 12 and the 18 or the 18 and the 25 in terms of their internal hierarchy.  I generally (not a rule, of course) prefer bourbons at least 6 years old and scotches at least 12 years old. It's nice to know that if there's a random brand on the shelf on sale, I can have a good guess at whether it's worth trying or not."
Scotch,3ctj62,The_PharmASSIST,3,Fri Jul 10 18:20:55 2015 UTC,"I don't care too much about the age of what I'm drinking. Octomore is one of the best whiskies I've ever had, and it is only 5 years old. I've also had a 37 year old Glengglassaugh, which was shite. As long as it's a good product, I will buy it.  Some events call for vintage or particularly aged whisky, though. For my 18th b-day I bought a dram of Talisker 18 because, well, I like Talisker, and I turned 18. Simple."
Scotch,3ctj62,belbivfreeordie,2,Fri Jul 10 19:20:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think the actual age itself is the issue.  I think the potential problem with NAS is that they market/price the spirit much more expensive than whiskies that might be significantly older.   Agreed though, if its a good product I couldn't care what the number on the side of the bottle is."
Scotch,3ctj62,kdz13,3,Sat Jul 11 01:58:15 2015 UTC,"I am at best highly suspicious of it. Of course there will be great NAS expressions and terrible AS expressions but it's just nice to know as much info as possible, and I don't see why that can't be standard. Kilchoman certainly doesn't seem to be hurting by making it known that a whisky is 4/5 years old. Because it's great whisky."
Scotch,3ctj62,belbivfreeordie,2,Fri Jul 10 20:15:46 2015 UTC,I read a WSJ article recently that is singing the praise of these products but I don't really know where I stand. Part of me thinks this is just the distiller's trying to keep up with the demand. But I have also read articles talking about how the age statements to begin with were a marketing ploy. I realize that age doesn't necessarily equate to  quality but.....  Just seeing other opinions...
Scotch,3ctj62,HughesDePayens,2,Fri Jul 10 17:35:19 2015 UTC,the search results here and on r/bourbon are really interesting too... the subject comes up periodically.
Scotch,3ctj62,KTRyan30,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:15:02 2015 UTC,Articles in the mainstream media about this seem entirely too credulous and just parroting what the industry people tell the writer about how age is overrated and so on.

Just a couple of quotes, right off the bat:    (From WhiskyLassie)  ""Another big whisky company has announced they are replacing a core expression of their product line with... a No Age Statement whisky. Now, mind you they have stated that the Glenlivet 12 (one of the most recognized & affordable whiskies) is not dead.

Scotch,3cpfh5,zillah1985,2,Thu Jul 9 21:32:49 2015 UTC,"Charles Street Liquors has Octomore 6.3 and a tasty store select of Eagle Rare, Redstone Liquors in Stoneham is pretty great and has a bunch of store selects, I found Weller 12 at a little place next to Kenmore, theres a good selection of places that carry High West's stuff around Andover too."

Scotch,3cpfh5,Galifreyan2012,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:46:11 2015 UTC,wasn't a serious question.  But looking at /new in r/scotch it's sure is suspicious!

Scotch,3cpfh5,mentel42,2,Fri Jul 10 10:39:22 2015 UTC,Possibly the most interesting news I've heard today. Time for me to take a look.
Scotch,3cpfh5,mentel42,2,Thu Jul 9 19:31:20 2015 UTC,"Hold on... you'll ship to Arizona? Despite our crappy liquor laws? Is this because of a license you applied for or is it uhh... hush hush ""you didn't see anything"" type of stuff? Because I'm okay with either.  Edit: Follow up question, what will the shipping policies look like after this launch event? Obviously the free shipping will go away, but will you no longer be shipping worldwide at that point?"
Scotch,3cpfh5,mentel42,2,Thu Jul 9 21:17:45 2015 UTC,"""you didn't see anything"" type of stuff   Yes.    The shipping prices are not yet definitive, but it will look like €10 for just a few samples, and for large quantities of samples or, 1 or multiple bottles, it will be around €25."
Scotch,3cpfh5,TheMemeIsALie,2,Thu Jul 9 21:30:09 2015 UTC,"Sweet. So you'll continue to ship to the US after the event? Cuz €10 is better than I can get for shipping samples here, even if I'm ordering from one state over."
Scotch,3cpfh5,zillah1985,2,Thu Jul 9 21:39:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, we will continue to ship to same countries as we currently do."
Scotch,3cpfh5,zillah1985,3,Thu Jul 9 21:50:40 2015 UTC,"Nice job! It looks awesome.  Out of curiosity, why does ex-vat change the price on samples but not on full bottles?"
Scotch,3cpfh5,TheMemeIsALie,6,Thu Jul 9 19:00:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much.  The ex VAT prices should be displaying properly for both full bottles and samples. Perhaps it's an error pertaining to a specific bottle. Would you care to link to the page with the error, or is it consistent across the site?  Cheers!"
Scotch,3cpfh5,skl007,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:08:17 2015 UTC,"Every page for me. Full bottles display the same price as ex vat http://www.finedrams.com/glenfarclas-25-year-old-whisky.html  Glenfarclas 25 says:  90,39 € 90,39 € ex VAT."
Scotch,3cpfh5,bigmoneysalsa,2,Thu Jul 9 19:13:54 2015 UTC,Yep - I'm seeing the same thing.
Scotch,3cpfh5,Lashujin,2,Thu Jul 9 19:17:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that is a little strange. It's probably just a temporary display error.  Have you tried adding an item to your cart, and if so, does it still display the price in the the same weird manner?"
Scotch,3cpfh5,banananon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:30:53 2015 UTC,"same price in cart, as well"
Scotch,3cpfh5,Razzafrachen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:39:03 2015 UTC,"It has most likely Geo Tagged you, and is now showing all prices ex VAT, because it knows you are outside the EU.

Scotch,3cpfh5,Razzafrachen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:51:13 2015 UTC,"cool, guess it seems weird b/c it does show different prices for samples. minor confusion for a first day, eh?"
Scotch,3cpfh5,Razzafrachen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:05:30 2015 UTC,"Ok, so it should only show ONE price (ex VAT) when it knows you are from a non-EU country. Please let me know if it looks alright now."
Scotch,3cpfh5,thedersy1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:28:58 2015 UTC,"samesies, shows price & price ex VAT, same price  guessing it is just showing the Ex VAT price for both, but kind of confusion. We Americans dont know from VAT, it sounds like a distillery blending technique :)"

Scotch,3cpfh5,mentel42,2,Sun Jul 12 23:51:10 2015 UTC,"Very nice website!  One question: does the VAT price on bottles come off for US buyers?  Also, I noticed that the Sort By option while browsing items is removed once you go to the next page of items.  Just a little bug I wanted to point out."

I also tried a different browser, tried different versions of my phone number, with and without hyphens, country codes, international dialing codes, etc.  EDIT: The problem appears to be when I list a separate billing address from the shipping address.  I was able to get my order to go through by only specifying one address, but something appears to be broken if you try to take advantage of both address blocks."

Scotch,3cpfh5,j4ni,4,Fri Jul 10 03:57:41 2015 UTC,"Hi!  I think that these five would be excellent starters:  From Japan:   Nikka Yoichi 10 Year Old ( a great, medium peated malt, with a pretty damn thick mouthfeel.)   Scotch   Talisker 10 Year Old (smoky and very 'coastal') Dalwhinnie 15 Year Old (full bodied, lots of honey and a solid oak influence) anCnoc 12 Year Old (A light a fruity dram - excellent for the summer months) Aberlour 12 Year Old Un-chillfiltered (a little higher in strength at 48%, with no chill filtration, making it a very flavouful sherried whisky)   Now, if peat is not your style, I can substitute some of the suggestions. ¨  Let me know.

Perhaps some bottlings from the independent bottler, The Ultimate Whisky Company. They're great value for money, and they put out some really great stuff.

I'd buy from you if I didn't live in Pennsylvania! And on that note, I don't know if you know, but while you can ship alcohol to a lot of US locations, you cannot ship alcohol to Pennsylvania. I don't think it would get you, the seller, or me, the buyer, into any kind of trouble, but the order would likely never be delivered, so you might as well save yourself the trouble and not ship it. I'm sure other US states pose the same problem. We still have to suffer from the leftovers of the temperance movement and Prohibition.  Good luck to you!"

Well, it's bloody tasty and 18 years old, meaning you buy two bottles, celebrate the birth with one and hold the other till they turn 18, at which point you open it up and celebrate again. This one is limited, therefore will not be available in a few years, making it a little special http://www.nicks.com.au/glendronach-18-year-old-marsala-cask-finish-single-malt-scotch-whisky-700ml"

Scotch,3cqrkm,Ethanized,2,Fri Jul 10 00:49:31 2015 UTC,"25 Scotchit reviews, and who knows how many overall reviews, I tasted half of this Tobermory sample sent by /u/BadgerHawkville. Decided to go back and see how my palate, and the sample, changed in the last couple of months.     Tobermory 15yr NCF – 46.3%    Category Notes    Setup: Neat, INAO, rested 20 minutes.   Color: Deep, coppery, amber.   Nose: Starts off quite fruity, but as it opens up, a more earthy character comes through. It’s a bit smoky, but not peaty. There’s still a lot of (baked?) apples and pears, but it’s not a super sweet smell. 28/30   Taste: It’s far more fruity than I remember, but there’s a touch of that meaty character I recall. Not nearly as hearty of a pour as I remember, although there’s still some spice – maybe nutmeg – hanging around. 26/30   Body: A bit sharp, nicely warm, medium body. 7/10   Finish: The flavors linger a minute, but the heat fades quickly. There’s a touch of that fruity bitterness that comes through at the end, I don’t remember that the last time I had a pour of this. 24/30   Score: 85/100   Value: 2/5 @ $150 for 750ml (5 = must buy; 4 = good buy; 3 = priced right; 2 = overpriced; 1 = avoid).       Average score to date: 83     Completely different experience from the first tasting, but I ended up with the same score! A lot more fruit and fewer baking spices this time around. Still a good pour, but I have to downgrade the value just a point considering some of the other drams I’ve tasted since. The bitter finish lost it a few points, and the score distribution favored the nose more than it did the first time around."
Scotch,3cqur0,HawkI84,2,Fri Jul 10 01:16:32 2015 UTC,"This is the second of the Glenmorangie private editions artisan cask editions, initially bottled I believe in 2008. Astar means “journey” in Gaelic. The maturation was done in some specially selected Missouri oak that was air dried for at least two years, heavily toasted and lightly charred. I stole all that info from Serge, btw.  57/1% abv. No age statement.  Nose - Lots of vanilla and cream soda, a very prominent raw ginger bite, black pepper, plenty of clove, honey, and some golden fruit. Rather powerful and aggressive neat. Like sex panther, it singes the nostrils. Water really brings out the oak spices, and opens it up.  Taste - Sweet honey, vanilla, golden delicious apple, and cream soda, with plenty of pepper coming in as it develops. Rather full bodied, probably about an 8 on a 1-10 scale (in terms of how full bodied it is) - has a creamier feel with water added, bit drier and more gingery too.  Finish - Lots of peppery spice, with the honey, golden delicious apple and vanilla notes continuing, with some citrus and a drying gingery element coming in too.  Nice stuff, but not awe-inspiring. It has the characteristics I normally associate with a bourbon-cask matured Scotch turned up to 11 when neat (although as far as I can tell from what I’ve read this is virgin oak, not bourbon). This one I do kind of prefer with a bit of water, that whole “it opens the whisky up” thing really applies here. Anyway, it’s got lots of honey, vanilla, light fruit, and oak spice, so if that’s what you’re after seek this out, as it’s a pretty good but not amazing version of it, and as it was a limited edition that's no longer produced.  87/100  Edited per dustless's input."

Personally I haven't had any Campletown or Lowlands Scotches, that I know of. What I listed is what is available on the website.   Pick any one or two out of those regions and you'll have a pretty good set. Again, I'm not expert. But this is what I would do. But really what you should do is look up reviews on all of these and anything else you think looks good and pick your own list! Though I'm sure others on the sub have a better idea of what to get.

None of the rules of thumb for regions can predict the flavor of a whisky unfamiliar to you because there are too many exceptions.  Islay is the exception where most malts follow the basic rule, but that's also partially because the area is so small."

Kudos to /u/Scotch_Fanatic for embarking on such an endeavour! I hope he's personally sampling each expression for quality assurance.   Anyway, here's a mystery dram from my recent swap with /u/Devoz. I'd tell you about it, but I have no idea what it is. Let's see if I can puzzle it out.   Mystery Dram from /u/Devoz  Strength: ??%  Color: Pale straw.   Nose: Light and crisp, with sweet floral notes. Honeysuckle and a hint of plums.   Palate: Honey and sweet summery white wine. It has a little bit of a bite to it, so I suspect it isn't too old and is about 46% ABV. It has a solid malt backbone that I expect from a bourbon cask matured whisky.   Finish: A touch hot but quickly becomes pleasantly warms. It hangs out for awhile.   Summary: This is a nice summer dram, light and floral and crisp. I suspect it's on the younger side, but it's well executed.   Score: 88/100   Guess: AnCnoc 12. If it isn't, it's quite similar.   Edit: Scotch Review #108  Whisky Review #219"
Scotch,3cqmpo,Devoz,3,Fri Jul 10 00:08:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a cruel person and gave you a rather difficult mystery dram. Caol ila 15 year unpeated.   Considering your inventory did not have much in the way of heavily peated drams, I thought this would be up your alley.   At 60.39% it is surprisingly soft and easy to drink. You were on the money with the aging in bourbon barrels.    I still cannot recognize this as Caol ila base, but I really enjoy it."
Scotch,3cqmpo,Devoz,2,Fri Jul 10 01:02:06 2015 UTC,"I like peat, I just haven't gotten into Ardbeg and Laphroaig. Caol Ila, for example, is the perfect level of peat for me.   And their unpeated stuff is excellent as well! Man, this didn't remind me of the stitchel reservation at all. AnCnoc 12 was my first impression, and I kind of wondered if maybe it was something like Longmorn 16. I never would have pegged this as an Islay!  Thanks for the dram, it's good stuff. I always save half of a mystery dram for post-reveal enjoyment."
Scotch,3cq89p,TheWhiskeyJug,3,Thu Jul 9 22:12:54 2015 UTC,"Bottle Info  Region: Speyside, Scotland  Distiller: Banff (1863 - 1983  Mashbill: 100% malted barley  Cask: ex-Bourbon  Age: 21 years  ABV: 57.3%  Cask Strength | Non-Chill Filtered | Natural Color  Price: N/A - Auction  / Private Sale    Review  Eye:  Almost clear  Nose: Malt, honey and fruit. It comes across light and young for something over 20 years old. I would have guessed a young Speyside if doing this blind, however what’s there isn’t too bad, just not very complex.  Palate: Malt, vanilla, fruit and a touch of wood. The palate reads a bit older, but it’s still coming across light and without much flair or complexity.  Finish: Malt and fruit fade to vanilla and wood on a short lived journey.  Balance, Body & Feel: Not much there to balance, but what’s there sits in harmony. Medium body and a flaxen watery feel.  Score: 80-82/100 (range given since it was not tasted at home)    Overall: The 1976 Banff 21 years Cadenhead’s Authentic wasn’t a bad whisky, it just wasn't an exciting or complex whisky and at 21 years old  I was surprised by its lack of complexity. I tried adding a little water and it opened up a wee bit, but not enough to make a major difference. Still, a very interesting whisky to try, and glad I did, but not one I’d go out of my way to hunt down. I’m sure there are some tremendous bottles of Banff out there, this though is not one of those bottles. After all the owners couldn’t have fought to keep it open after numerous fires and having German bombs dropped on it if it was all mediocre… right?    1976 Banff 21 years Cadenhead’s Authentic Review on my site if you’re interested."

Or is it that so many people had already stopped buying it that there's so much improvement to be made?

Tasted in a GlenCairn.  Color:.  Honey  Nose: Subtle, doesn’t show its ABV here. Paint smell, loads of vanilla.  Nose with water: Sweetness, slightly salty, pecan pie. Like it so far!  Palate with water Full, soft, slight grapefruit, tangy notes.  Very nice!  Finish: Long, zesty, peppery.  The peppery note took a while to come forward.  Thoughts: For the price point here in Ontario, definite buy, although I suspect I would need to wait for a 3rd release.  This is a cask strength whisky, that doesn’t act like a cask strength whisky (with a bit of water of course), does that make sense?  Rating 80/100 -"
Scotch,3cp3g7,muaddib99,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:13:14 2015 UTC,it was the 2012 version so yes i think it was 2nd release. 57.5 is the correct ABV... did I write 57.2?  edit: $67

Scotch,3cp17s,XenonBloom,3,Thu Jul 9 16:56:44 2015 UTC,"Review #3: Mystery Dram  Today I am going to review a mystery dram that was sent to me by /u/normallyimonimgur in a very recent swap. I must say I am really impressed with the generosity of this community and am glad to be a part. Not only did he throw in an extra sample to sweeten the deal but also included this surprise mystery sample. Most impressed.  Based on the color it is very obvious that no E150 has been added to this juice. I also swear I saw some particulate so possibly non chill filtered? But how could this be so light and not taste young? I am torn on the aspect of filtering for this dram. On to the tasting notes.  Proof: 80-90?  Age: 10?  Pour: 2.0 oz neat in a scottish glencairn  Color: straw  Nose: Distant driftwood campfire on the beach leads to briny salt marsh at low tide. Honey and malt. Dried stonefruit.   Palate: Warm and creamy. Sea salt mixed with light coastal peaty. Graham crackers.   Finish: White pepper and honey. Ashy and dry. Oak.  Score: 3.0/5.0  I found this be a very tasty whisky with nice touches of coastal peat and malt. Almost like a summer beach whisky to be sipped on after the sun sets and the kids go to sleep. The proof was dialed in perfectly and did not require any further dilution. What jumps out at me is how similar this is to Oban minus the peat. Almost as if this might not be a single malt but a blend of a few different whiskys.   My lack of experience with scotch whisky is really showing and has caused me to raise the white flag. If you asked me to make an assessment I would imaginatively compare to a 80/20 blend of Oban 14 and Caol Ila 12.   Would I drink again? Absolutely. Would I buy a bottle? That depends on the cost and availability. Now, would someone please tell me what the hell I just drank?!"
Scotch,3cp17s,normallyimonimgur,3,Thu Jul 9 16:56:58 2015 UTC,"Glad you enjoyed it!  And the Great Reveal drum roll  The Arran Malt ""The Island Malt"" Sauternes Cask Finish. 100 proof, 50% abv, natural color and un-chillfiltered (good call on that, something I can't pick up on yet). I paid $64 here in MI.  EDIT: This is a NAS bottle, but I have found that before it was finished in wine casks it sat in the wood for 8 years"
Scotch,3cp17s,tvraisedme,2,Thu Jul 9 17:13:27 2015 UTC,Nice! The saunternes casks explain the stonefruit notes I picked up on. Very smooth for a 100 proofer.
Scotch,3cod0j,madgraf,4,Thu Jul 9 13:53:52 2015 UTC,"Hello /r/scotch- here with my one-hundred sixteenth review. I got this in a sample swap with /u/jrsheppa recently. This was released last year as a followup to the Supernovas from 2009 and 2010 which were very heavily peated. For this release, they used some amount of sherry cask whiskies in the vatting to help add some complexity in there given the very heavily peated stock.  Nose Sour malt, pickled cabbage, loads of brine with some clay and rubber notes. The peat is there, but I honestly find it more in the background compared to some of their other releases despite this being the supposed peat bomb. I wonder if the sherry casks involved tamed it that much  Mouthfeel Medium weight  Palate Smoked meats and big peat - a little tobacco type note to the smoke here  Finish Fades quickly with dry oak and notes of an extinguished match, peat lingers for awhile  Balance Not bad - the sherry cask might have some effect, but not sure it's that noticeable. Peat isn't very overwhelming  Rating 82/100: Good but not great for me. One of my least favorite of the Ardbegs I've had lately - the nose is strange, but palate/finish are like a tamed Corryvreckan.  Value for the money These went for around $150 at retail which I think is overpriced. I think the US got less than 1000 bottles of this, but I would've liked to see it around the same price as the committee releases or maybe even the Oogie/Corryvreckan.

Scotch,3cod0j,jooni81,2,Thu Jul 9 13:53:56 2015 UTC,"I found this to be underwhelming as well, and at close to $200, rather disappointing. I've really soured on Ardbeg these days, and probably won't be buying any of their new releases moving forward. Corry/Oog have a place in my heart, tho."
Scotch,3cod0j,mapolo29,2,Thu Jul 9 16:57:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm starting to sour on them a bit compared to other Islays, but there are still quite a few I haven't tried."
Scotch,3cod0j,jrsheppa,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:58:57 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with what you are saying here. I do think it is overpriced and should be closer to 100 or less.  I also like Uigeadail and Corry better, but I think this is almost as good as those other two.  Also, I'd have to try them side by side, but it didn't make think it was a more tame Corry.  If anything I remember it having as much or more punch to it."
Scotch,3coiro,wiep,2,Thu Jul 9 14:40:15 2015 UTC,"Highland Park's 18 year old single malt has doubled in price in just about a year. So when I could get a sample for only a fraction of the regular retail price, I didn't hesitate at all. An excellent opportunity to see if HP18 is worth the 100ish euro it currently goes for.         Highland Park 18 Year Old / 43% / sample (retail: around €/£100) * Nose: Salted espresso, some red fruit and buttery tobacco. Light peat in the background. Rich smell, very nice. * Taste: Full body with medium thickness. Good balance between salt and sweet. Some smoked nuts with forest fruit and lightly peated honey. * Finish: Medium long. Lingering, with salt, some herbs and a little bit of spicy, sherried chocolate. * Rating: 87/ 100         The HP18 is an excellent whisky. With wonderful, rich flavours, it's a lot better than the 12 year old. Did I enjoy it? Yes, absolutely! Would I pay €100 for a bottle? No, there are better ways to spend that amount of money, imho."
Scotch,3coiro,boonz,2,Thu Jul 9 14:40:36 2015 UTC,I'm a huge fan of the HP 12 and have wondered for a while if I should get the 18 or go straight to 21 as the 18 is so damn expensive by now. Any thoughts?
Scotch,3coiro,Rallerboy888,2,Thu Jul 9 17:36:55 2015 UTC,"Buy or trade a sample somewhere and try it yourself. That's the cheapest way to find out. I haven't tried the 21yo myself yet, but since it's double the price of the 18yo here, it should be hell of a lot better to make up for the price difference."

Scotch,3cobtu,madgraf,3,Thu Jul 9 13:44:09 2015 UTC,"Hello /r/scotch- here with my one-hundred fifteenth review. I got this in a sample swap with /u/jrsheppa recently. The Galileo was released in 2012. It was aged 12 years in a combination of ex-bourbon and Marsala casks and bottled at 49%. As part of this release, there was some crazy marketing effort where some samples of ardbeg were launched into space to study the effects.  Nose Peat with a lot of sweet, dark fruits: plums, dates, black cherry. A little seaweed, pepper, and apricot develop after awhile  Mouthfeel Very thick  Palate Ashy peat up front with hazelnut and black pepper  Finish Ashy peat continues on with bitter oak and salted/dried fish emerging  Balance Love the marsala influence on the nose - wish it would appear more in palate/finish  Rating 87/100: Very good - the marsala cask adds a lot to the nose and helps this stand out from other standard Ardbeg expressions.  Value for the money These went for around $95 at retail, but guessing these are closer to $150 or so on the secondary currently, but haven't seen a lot of them selling. I'd be in at around $100.

Scotch,3cmxko,WhiskeyMasterRace,3,Thu Jul 9 03:49:52 2015 UTC,"Good evening /r/Scotch! WhiskeyMasterRace here with a fun review, my first mystery sample! This sample came in a trade with /u/Lashujin. Not much else to say here so let's dive right in!    Color Between white whine and pale straw   Nose Lots of smoke, earthy peat, some sweet fruit notes, almost like bbq sauce, a faint hint of vanilla, medicinal, burnt rubber. Intense notes, there is a slight presence of alcohol on the nose. I would like the sweetness to be a bit more pronounced though. 8/10  Taste Smoke is much calmer here, toffee, a very faint citrus, bitter black coffee, apricot, stamp adhesive. Less intense here,  and with some very interesting flavors. The alcohol is present but not overbearing. 43/50  Body Medium-thin with minimal oil, just like an Islay should be IMO 10/10  Finish The finish is fairly short, smoke and peat linger, after a moment the apricot tries to peek out. Just long enough to enjoy the smoke and want to go right back for another sip. 16/20  Value I have no idea what this whisky is or how much it costs, but I would gladly spend up to $65-$70 to get a bottle of it. Solid flavors of Islay with enough room to be accessible to new drinkers. I will no score this, I will just do a score out of 90 and provide the percent as my score in overall.     Overall This is a very enjoyable pour and it's making me feel bad for including a sample of a cheap blended Islay malt as his mystery sample. I would definitely look to buy this and try other products from this distillery! Total: 86/100  My Guesses   Islay Single Malt Scotch Tastes mature, but the color has me thinking its young ~5-10 years ABV likely around 50% My Guess: Kilchoman 100% Islay 4th Edition   I've never done anything like this before and I don't have a tremendous background in Scotch...hopefully I'm close on something"
Scotch,3cmxko,Lashujin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:50:11 2015 UTC,"Correct! Your notes are interesting. I haven't reviewed this properly myself yet and will have to compare my notes to yours when I do. I get a distinct ""fish tank"" note from it when I add water. That may sound bad, but I actually really like this malt. The bottle has been open and about half full for a few months, so some of the flavor has changed a bit since it was first opened (more fruit). I can't compare to other Kilchoman whisky as I haven't had anything else.  I wouldn't feel bad about the sample trade whatsoever, I really liked the sample (gave it an 86 as well) and it has inspired me to seek out more quality blends."
Scotch,3cmjgf,ChainChompsky,5,Thu Jul 9 01:51:26 2015 UTC,"This is: my first Tamdhu, a Speyside distillery that likes 8yo bottlings for some reason. However, Signatory bottled this one – from a single first-fill sherry cask – at cask strength. Sounds promising. 61.4%ABV, $60    Color: gold-amber.    Nose: raw... alcohol, chigarid, raisin-sherry oak, and cornhusk.    Taste: peppery & sweet... cinamon, lots of malt, red pepper, and honey.    Finish: sherry... big raisin, definite unripe banana, unripe strawberry, walnut, and dark chocolate.    Conclusions: like a mix of Balvenie 15 and Macallan Cask Strength although less refined than either. Wonderfully powerful. Immature, but very drinkable without any water added, I'm going to put him at Aberlour a'Bunadh and Glenfarclas 105's level, which is impressive – and for $20 cheaper than either, it's a steal. 89/100"
