We know that ""yours"" is a possessive pronoun, cf. le vôtre in French.  We also know that English is an extremely analytic language, and the 's can apply to entire noun phrases.  So, if the favor (of a judgement) goes to the king of Spain, we can say, ""in the king of Spain's favor.""  But if the favor goes to ""one of you,"" why don't we say, ""in one of you's favor?""  The only proper way (seems to me) to use ""in one of yours' favor"" would be if you owned two cars, and I'm judging them for performance or something. I'd be deciding ""in one of yours' favor,"" i.e. ""in one of your car's favor."""

Now, you could sort of fix it by deciding that it will only be a possessive determiner, not a possessive pronoun. In this case it would read ""...in one of your favors."" But that is still unclear, since English doesn't distinguish between singular ""your"" (i.e. ""thy"") and plural ""your"".

However, as many transgender individuals will tell you, they have always ""been"" the gender they were prior to their transition, or ""coming out."" Therefore, to stay consistent with Caitlyn's identity, you should always use feminine pronouns, even when referring to a past experience, because she has always been female, despite presenting masculinity.  ""When did she win her medals?"" is the correct choice.  As for naming, I believe it would be correct to call her Bruce when describing some circumstances in the same way it's correct to call Marilyn Monroe ""Norma Jean Baker"" when talking about her childhood. But to avoid using the name ""Bruce"" with a feminine pronoun, using ""Jenner"" without her first name is probably the best choice when talking about the past."

So in this case, Bruce/Caitlyn was always female, even before her transition.  However, back to the original question, it was Bruce (at the time) who competed for, and won, the Men's medal.  This is a tricky situation because now you're distinguishing between sex (which was male) and gender (which was female).  I would tend to think that because this was something for which the sex of the individual mattered so much, I would use the male pronouns and the name ""Bruce"" to identify the Olympic participation and things directly related to it. For things of a personal nature for which the sex didn't play a significant role, I would use the female pronouns, but still use ""Bruce"" as the name but with the clarifying phrase ""as she was then known"" or something to that effect.  Above all else, I think that Caitlyn, or the transgender community, should be able to trump any of my opinions if she were to clarify how she'd prefer these to be distinguished, and yet they should be understanding of the confusion that some may have in finding the appropriate pronouns."

He makes a convincing argument both in the article above and in The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language, which he coauthored with Rodney Huddleston. There's a huge chapter on prepositions which definitely made me rethink my conception of the class.

The second version is not grammatically incorrect, but you're unlikely to hear a native speaker say it.   We use the present perfect (have driven) when we talk about the first time we've done something because the tense is unique in an important way: it captures both the present and the time leading up to the present.   Saying this is the first time I've driven captures two things: the time leading up to now, during which you had never driven; and the present, where the tense conveys the continuative aspect of your driving.  Most speakers would probably add some sort of adverb phrase. Like ""this is the first time I've ever driven"" to convey that this truly is your first time driving. Or something like ""this is the first time I've driven since Wednesday"" to more specifically define the past time frame during which you hadn't been driving."

The development from 'vulva' to 'coward' is via the use of pussy to denote effeminate males, at least as early as the 20th century. This semantic development ('female organ' > 'female-like') is not at all unexpected.  Pussy in the sense of coward doesn't show up until the mid-20th century, in America, where I doubt pusillanimous was any commoner than it is today (and therefore a less likely source for this slang).  Pusillanimous isn't even pronounced like pussy, so it's somewhat of a stretch to begin with.   The word is not often spoken aloud, so you may be unaware of how it is pronounced.

grammar,3du524,IshidaRocks,4,Sun Jul 19 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"What is funny is that I think this kind of thing might be helpful to people who are learning to speak English as a second language. For example, it can be useful to explain that in ""voiced"" the ""d"" sound becomes a ""t"" sound ""voist"", or that in make (meik) the ""k"" is unvoist. I think this can be a good tool to approach pronunciation with  beginners, who haven't learned the IPA yet.  I think the problem with that ""phonetic system"" is that it constrains the spelling to a particular accent, while one of the main characteristics of the language is the rich variety of them, and that's one of the beauties of the language. For example, am I wrong to say that ""riplais"" is how an Australian person would pronounce ""replace"", while the American pronunciation would be something like ""ripleis""?      If my grammar and wording doesn't give me away, which I think is rare, I'm not a native English speaker."

Trask also describes other practical roadblocks to spelling reform, including the huge amount of text in the current spelling that would have to be redone, and the time and trouble in re-teaching people the new system even though they're fully up to date on the system we have now."

To articulate '-ed' as [d] in this case is unnatural.  Compare this to other examples of assimilation where proximal consonants share voicing:   Book - Booked [bʊkt], [k] is voiceless, therefore '-ed/-en' is voiceless Bog - Bogged [bɔgd], [g] is voiced, therefore '-ed/-en' is voiced   Both cases are allomorphs (i.e. different phonetic realizations of the same morpheme) of the past participle/past tense."

Unless you speak a really, really obscure dialect, it is very unlikely that you actually pronounce 'voiced' without a [t] in a casual setting (i.e. I can imagine an English/ESL teacher doing so to encourage students to spell by ear, but otherwise [sd] does not occur naturally).  I think you are confusing your actual pronunciation (what I've been writing in [square brackets]) with your mental phonemic representation ( using /slashes/) of the '-ed'. This is common amongst speakers with no linguistic background. For example, how do you pronounce 'little'? What sound comes to your mind for 'tt' in this case?  If you really want to contest this, provide a high-quality, casual (i.e. not made for the purpose of proving your point) recording of you pronouncing '-ed' as [d] following a voiceless consonant.

Some people drop the ""h"", so saying ""an istoric event"" sounds correct.  The use of ""an"" is not some made up rule for grammar nazis.  It developed because of the difficulty in pronouncing two vowels in a row because you really have to enunciate to say ""a istoric event"" properly (or quit dropping the ""h"").  Even people who drop the ""h"" on ""historic"" tend to pronounce it on ""house"" and ""hunch"", so they don't use ""an"" for those."

grammar,3dg1v3,deleigh,7,Thu Jul 16 00:02:40 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid that's just how it is. ;D  But the ridiculously comprehensive Cambridge Grammar of the English Language has a lot to say about bare noun phrases; these are nouns that appear without a determiner, such as the, a, some, any and so on.  There are lots of different categories of bare NPs, but here's what the CGEL has to say about the kind that you're asking about:   ...the noun [in a phrase like in school] acts as an indication of the associated activity, and does not have its standard denotation. Contrast, for example, Ed is in bed (resting/asleep) with referential There are fleas in the bed; or Ed is in prison (serving time) with There was a riot in the prison; or again Ed is in church (at a service) with There is a new pulpit in the church. The nouns which permit this use are severely restricted. We do not have for example Ed is at desk (studying), Ed is at computer (working), Ed is in kitchen (cooking). Nevertheless there are a fair number of them: others include the...nouns in such expressions as on campus, in class, at college, settle out of court, at sea (as a sailor), at table (for a meal), leave town, start university. [Some of these are used by speakers of British English and might sound a bit odd to speakers of American English.]    So your TL,DR is this: the noun can be used with the if we're focusing more on the associated activity than the place itself. But there are only so many nouns that allow this, and there's really no underlying logic for which ones do and which ones don't."

Otherwise you say college meaning the time you were at college. Similarly, 'the karate class' is a specific class you have already made known to the person you are speaking to whilst 'karate class' is taken to mean 'a karate class', but which one is not important.   As for 'the army' each country has only one army (unless it's in civil war) so the army refers to the particular army of the country a person is from. 'On the street' is a set phrase and refers not to a specific street but to the outdoor urban area in general.   The point is here is most of these are cases of definite (uses the) versus indefinite articles. We can omit 'a/an' (the indefinite article) but not 'the'.

They certainly don't like being told that it doesn't make sense to ignore the meaning of words within a phrase simply because their dialect accepts that phrase.   You're right on your first point: the Americans here for the most part are indeed against linguistic prescription.   Your second point, though, makes absolutely no sense. (It also reeks of snobbery.) Are you talking about the phrase on accident? Are you arguing that Americans tend to accept the phrase because we're willing to ignore the meanings of the words within the phrase?  If that is your argument, then it exhibits a stunning amount of ignorance about how English works. The language has hundreds (thousands?) of idioms that cannot be parsed literally based on the meanings of the words they comprise. Do you reject the phrase look [something] up because the phrase ignores the meaning of the word up? Or do you allow that the phrase is an idiom that would be accepted by all native speakers?   Ditto on purpose. The phrase is idiomatic-'it's so ingrained in the way we speak that we never stop and think, hey, when you parse it literally it doesn't make much sense. On accident is no different from on purpose or any other idiomatic phrase.   What's really going on in this thread (in general, not just with this comment) is good old-fashioned linguistic snobbery: ""My way is the right way because I believe it is and it's how I was taught and it sounds right to me and only people who I consider somehow below me use a different version.""

'On purpose' means having purpose. Using your logic, we should be equally accepting of 'by purpose'. Nonsense.  'Up' in 'look x up' refers to place. As in find x's position.

grammar,3dd78p,smegnose,3,Fri Jul 17 01:37:46 2015 UTC,"Friend, you just don't understand how idiomatic phrases work.    You are so wrong. Open a bloody dictionary. 'By accident' uses 'by' to attribute agency to the 'accident'.    I'm not sure that you understand the concept of grammatical agency.    'On purpose' means having purpose.   No, on purpose does not mean having purpose. Write a sentence using on purpose then try to substitute having purpose. The phrase on purpose is idiomatic. Parsed literally, it does not make sense. Purpose means aim or intention, so the phrase literally means something like on aim or on intention, neither of which sounds correct to a native speaker. We use on purpose idiomatically to mean intentionally.   Using your logic, we should be equally accepting of 'by purpose'. Nonsense.   Again, since idiomatic phrases do not work literally, by purpose could conceivably be a thing. But it isn't, not because it's nonsense but because no English speakers use it. It sounds jarring and ungrammatical because it's not a construction that our grammar currently allows. It's why on accident sounds jarring to you. Not because there's anything inherently wrong or ungrammatical about it but because it's not part of your grammar.    'Up' in 'look x up' refers to place. As in find x's position.   Oh, come on. If I ask you to look up the name of a song, how does place or position come into play? Even though up has no logical reason to be in that sentence, we know that look up means to search for and find something. The phrase itself does not convey that meaning; rather, native speakers know what the phrase conveys idiomatically.     Regardless of these specific idioms, arguing for replacement of widely-accepted, logical versions with rarer, illogical ones is foolish.   There is nothing illogical about on accident, at least nothing that's any more illogical than on purpose. You just don't like it. Maybe you're older and don't like how language has changed.  Maybe you associate the phrase with people who you feel are somehow beneath you. Maybe you just think it sounds silly. And that's fine. Snobby, ignorant of how language works, but fine. But don't try to couch your personal aversion to a phrase in illogical arguments about concepts that you don't understand."

Nowhere have I said that we shouldn't keep our existing, well-accepted idioms. I'm saying that ignorance/laziness is not a good excuse to replace perfectly usable idioms with illogical ones. There are enough.  Way too literal, mate. 'On purpose' does indeed mean performing an action and having purpose in doing so. The 'on' conveys this. What a ramble.  Equally accepting of 'by purpose' as a new replacement for 'on purpose'? What for? To accommodate people who don't read?  'Go up to that person.' Would it be likely that you travelled horizontally or vertically? Yes, up refers to place and, if you looked up a song's name, there  that name would be written in the place you found it.  Again, 'on accident' is like saying you deliberately had an accident, i.e. not an accident. It's contradictory. Contradictory statements are illogical.  You're not doing very well at concealing contempt for my position, exclaiming my ignorance, yet you scold me for pointing out the very same. I don't think ignorance should have an equal footing with knowledge when it comes to language, and nor do you."

And what do locations have to do with the meaning of words in a dictionary?   Regardless of these specific idioms, arguing for replacement of widely-accepted, logical versions with rarer, illogical ones is foolish.

If people are saying ""on accident"" then it is a part of their dialect and is therefore how that dialect is defined.  Of course dialects can have more than one way to say something so in some of these dialects where ""on accident"" is standard or acceptable so too might ""by accident"" be.  And finally, in some dialects (eg, yours) the construction ""on accident"" might be considered non-standard and might even mark someone as being a speaker of a different dialect.  Also, ""on accident"" is not a feature of Standard American English but there are several dialects spoken in America where it is standard or acceptable.   Given the obviousness of the parallel construction with ""on purpose"", I wouldn't be surprised to see ""on accident"" become the dominant construction in time. It just makes sense. And like I said in a different comment in a different thread, it's the speakers of a dialect/language who do not go by the rules memorized in formal education who actually take a more logical, rational, and thoughtful approach to language and this is another example."

I would argue that in a sentence it would probably have to be: ""I paid a one dollar 95 cent processing fee"".   First of all, 'fee' is a singular count noun, so it requires a determiner. I chose 'a' for the example, but in context it could be 'the', 'that', 'their', ... whatever. I mention this only because it is a hint as to why I would say 'cent' rather than 'cents', namely the entire group 'one dollar 95 cent processing' is acting as an adjective modifying the noun 'fee'. Adjectives are always singular.  Always.  There are examples of plural attributive nouns, but this is not one of them, so we don't need to go into that!"

""One dollar 95 cent"" is a measurement modifier, which are almost always singular.    ""Processing"" is a participle, in some kind of non-attributive thematic role.

It does what passive clauses usually do with their active counterparts (in this case, [agent] paid the dog attention): it puts the direct object in the subject position.

OTB got it right by putting the true direct object--attention--in the subject position.) But readers would likely have trouble parsing the sentence: it sounds like an error, as though the writer meant to write The dog paid attention or The dog was paying attention.   And speakers of American English at least would most likely prefer paid attention to the dog to paid the dog attention anyway.   The active version of the other sentence is [Agent] paid attention to the dog. Your passive version is putting the object of a preposition in the subject position.   Sometimes this works, especially if that prepositional comes immediately after the verb, e.g.   Someone slept in that bed.  That bed was slept in by someone.    But things get iffier with verbs that take a direct object and then prepositional phrase as a complement:   I shared my pizza with him.  He was shared my pizza with.

Commercial print is not necessarily one of those contexts as I can within the pages of my commercial newspaper refer to someone as a realtor with any punctuation I want even if they are not licensed by the NAR and there's nothing they can do about it (they can try but my use is protected). What I cannot get away with is calling myself a Realtor when I'm not licensed to do so and try to sell my services/products using that designation. These are important differences.

(b) All forms of news reporting and news commentary   There are lots and lots of other exceptions carved out over the years, usually when a trademark owner tried to stop the use of one of 'their' words in way that the courts perceived as unreasonable. The courts so far have been very supportive of commonsense casual usages.   My point though is that they had standing to sue in the first place.

Anyway. The vast majority of time you will use the past tense: I reamed, he humped, she rode, and so on.  The past perfect is used to convey something that happened in the past, but with a twist: it is something that had happened in the past even earlier than something else that happened in the past. This is why some call it the past past.  This pair of sentence illustrates our need for the past perfect:   When I arrived at the party, everyone left. When I arrived at the party, everyone had left.   In the first version, both verbs are in the simple past, so we assume that those events were concurrent. That is, my arriving at the party and everyone's leaving happened at the same time.  The second sentence conveys that when I arrived (past tense) at the party, everyone had already left prior to that. When we use the past perfect we often couple it with adverbials like already or earlier that day. Indeed, the second sentence up there would sound more natural if the second part read everyone had already left.  There another situation in which you'll need the past perfect: if clauses that are situated in the past: if I had done this, then this.   If I hadn't spent so much of my life watching tentacle porn, I might have become a successful trapeze artist. You would have passed your geography test if you hadn't insisted on labeling each country in Europe with the name of a member of N*Sync.   You'll find that day to day you rarely need the past perfect, but there will be times when it's (probably) necessary, so it helps to know how to use it. I say ""probably"" there because many people get by just fine without ever using the past perfect."

As we changed the rules to expect commas as punctuation in specific situations, the comma splice became disfavored and fell out of edited prose. Even authors of edited prose, however, continued to use comma splices in their personal correspondence.

grammar,3d2qp4,sylban,-4,Mon Jul 13 04:05:22 2015 UTC,"In your example, the two potentially independent clauses are so short and so tightly bound to each other by rational association that they serve to sufficiently bind to each other in a single statement. I would call it technically incorrect, but your specific example is one well established by idiom, which often excuses what would otherwise be errors. One way to think about it, perhaps, is like bodies attracted to each other by gravity. Ask yourself, if I left these two or three clauses to themselves, would they be likely to attract and orbit each other? Are they that closely associated with each other? If not, then they likely require some rational connection or separator -- more than a comma.  And it's not about meaning, it's about general structure, if you just write and write and never stop it tires out the reader, that's inconsiderate and communicates a sense that you think what you've got to say is more important than taking the time and consideration to make it clear for others, and it also comes across as rushed and somewhat immature, or maybe you didn't really pay attention in school, or you're just kind of lazy, like someone who doesn't bother putting on real clothes to go to the store, see how this example paragraph reads and comes across?  Most grammar is common sense, and this no different. If you find yourself stringing independent statements together without stopping, you should ask yourself what in your psychology is motivating you to do that. I've asked people directly about it, and the closest I've ever gotten to anything like an explanation is actually kind of sad. ""People will think you're done and stop reading?"" Really? Are other people four-year-olds or something? They sound like cheap excuses to me. In my mind, it could only be sadder if they were true.  Think of words as atoms, sentences as molecules, and paragraphs as cohesive lumps of matter. Sentences are important foundational blocks of the matter of language and communication. Comma splices break that structure down into a contiguous sludge wherein individual statements become less clear, for being less clearly marked. It's really as simple as that.

grammar,3d2qp4,beepbeepbeepbeepboop,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:58:51 2015 UTC,"Personally, I find comma splices force me to ""say"" a sentence in a way that would be unnatural for me, or confuse me as to how the writer imagined it should be said.   I'm sort of thinking aloud from here on, so bear with or ignore me.  I previously posted a comment about comma splices in transcription, and how they can be an important marker of a speaker's prosody, albeit at the expense of conventional punctuation in the written form. The problem is, this suggests that commas can have a purely prosodic rather than syntactic function (which I think they have only in the sense that prosody coincides with syntactic features and therefore with where we place punctuation in writing). Also, for me, it is hard not to think of someone ""speaking in comma splices"", even though, of course, commas do not exist in speech.   So I was thinking a lot about this and was trying to remember examples of where I might have needed to use a comma splice in transcription and whether there might have been some sort of corresponding underlying syntax.   The example I used before was ""I went to the zoo, I saw a bear."" I can think of two cases when this comma splice might correspond with syntax.  1) The speaker is setting up to present a list but stops after the second item.   In ""I went to the zoo, I saw a bear, then I had lunch"", I think it would be unfair to call out the first comma as a comma splice, as we are adhering to the convention of using commas to separate items in a list; the second item just happens to be an independent clause. In most cases, however, the speaker would reevaluate the syntax of the sentence and trail off to indicate the missing item(s), which would give us ""I went to the zoo, I saw a bear..."". As we don't know what's ""missing"", it's hard to claim we definitely have a comma splice.   It is also entirely possible that the speaker reevaluates the syntax and uses prosody indicative of sentence termination when they realise they have only two items, giving us ""I went to the zoo, I saw a bear"" (possibly with a pause, as in ""I went to the zoo, I...saw a bear""). In writing, one can rework the punctuation when they realise they have really presented two separate ideas, but one cannot erase the way in which they initially uttered the sentence.  2) The speaker uses prosody as they would for ""I went to the zoo and saw a bear"", only they substitute ""I"" for ""and"". The comma may not be necessary in this case, but has only a negligible effect on perceived pausing and does help to separate the ideas visually. A semi colon, period, or ellipsis at any place in the sentence would suggest different prosody and therefore fail to capture the way the speaker spoke.  I guess, to sum up, people write in comma splices because they are writing as they would speak, probably following their internal monologue. Again, they can ""correct"" the punctuation once the sentence is fully written, and would be advised to do so in formal writing (you know, comma splice disdain and all that), but, in a conversational medium such as reddit, is there a need to?"

But you asked so here we go:  Let's start with the ""rationally structured sentence"" argument (or any variation on the idea that there is some inherent logic to avoiding comma splices). In order to prove that avoiding commas splices is logically correct one would have to start from first principles and derive Standard Written English. And then formulate the theorem that comma splices are incorrect.  But we mustn't stop there, what about languages where commas splices are acceptable or even required (German and Bulgarian come to mind) are those folks all just being illogical or is it acceptable in those languages? To be complete in our rational assessment of the issue you'd also need to derive those language's corresponding orthographies as well.  But don't worry, it's not quite as difficult as it sounds! You don't need to actually learn those languages. I'm not a linguist but I'm guessing there are like 20 or so general features we use to categorize languages (like agglutinative, word order matters or not, SVO v SOV etc, etc). So just compile those features for each language and then derive its corresponding orthography. I bet there's a Python library that'll do most of the heavy lifting.  Hopefully everyone will agree that this is absurd. There is no way to actually derive a language's orthography from these ""first principles"". But further hopefully the point is made: there is nothing inherently logical or illogical about any writing system including how one deals with comma splices.  So what of the claim that it causes some problems for certain readers when they encounter commas splices? Worthless observation. There is always something that causes problems. It's the nature of communication. If a comma splice causes anything more than a half second pause then there is something seriously wrong with the reader and comma splices are the least of their problems.  So how do I really feel about comma splices? Simple: I endorse them. And my reasoning is this. Any writing feature that is common among people without a formal education is almost always (if not always) based on superior reasoning than the contradictory position taken by those who have retained their formal education with respect to writing.  Here's how it works, for the people who do not have the formal education their brains are constantly noticing patterns in writing and speech and are forming ""theories"" on how to handle whatever situation comes up. This is a largely non-conscious process as this person lacks the requisite vocabulary or context to consciously formulate their position but the important takeaway is their brains have figured all this shit out.  Here's an example. Take the word ""alot"". Why is that spelling so common? Because it makes the most sense. Spend five minutes thinking about this and you'll agree. What's the pattern with phrases that start with an a that is pronounced as a schwa? They are all* spelled as one word. With the obvious exception of ""a lot"". The brains of these non-formally trained folk have noticed this pattern (even if they cannot consciously articulate it) and when confronted with the word ""alot"" they conclude that it should be spelled as ""alot"". It fits the pattern, it's consistent, which means as that as far as the written word can be said to be logical is logical.  Maintaining the ""a lot"" spelling is now, obviously, illogical. The people who maintain the ""a lot"" spelling have memorized a senseless and arbitrary rule and are ignoring the logic of the spelling.  Likewise, when it comes to comma splices I trust the intuitions of the people who do not know the formal rule but whose brains have noticed the patterns of writing and have concluded that a comma is needed in this here spot comma splice rule be damned, beyond the formally trained people who lazily rely upon their having memorized an arbitrary rule but who no longer take the time to think through problem (whether consciously or not).  Finally, I am grateful that noone on /r/grammar has pulled out the bullshit line from DFW about how not following the ""standard rules"" is disrespectful to one's readers.   P.S. Some might think my reference to what is logical contradicts my initial argument against the inherent logic of language. There is no contradiction. The former refers to the question of whether language and its corresponding orthographies are inherently logical where the latter deal with logical nature of subsystems being logical within themselves given the larger context with the understanding that it is possible to construct a contradictory subsystem with neither being inherently more Correct than the other.  * This might not be true but is mostly true. If anyone knows of other exceptions I'd love to hear them."

grammar,3d3q35,caecorum,2,Mon Jul 13 17:05:23 2015 UTC,"I can explain the grammar of it. According to the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language,    Unless occurs in open conditionals and, less freely, remote ones.   OP's sentence contains an open conditional, since the sentence does not meet the criteria for a remote one. The CGEL argues that unless   means ""except if"" or, more explicitly, ""in all circumstances except if"".    So OP's sentence is essentially saying   [In all circumstances except if] I'm mistaken, they have to be plugged in for hours every day.   The CGEL considers conditional clauses to be adjuncts, but that's not quite the same as calling them sentence openers. And they're definitely connected grammatically to the matrix clause.   The book also considers unless phases to be prepositional phrases (unless as head, finite clause as complement to unless), so I think you're on to something comparing it to in my opinion. But despite the similarity of the grammar in the two PPs, the ways they work in the sentence are different, so I think we have to maintain OP's sentence as a conditional construction."
grammar,3d3q35,jack_fucking_gladney,2,Mon Jul 13 19:40:46 2015 UTC,"I like your analysis, but let me run a few things by you...  First, these two sentences are interchangeable:   Unless I'm mistaken, they have to be plugged in for hours every day. If I'm not mistaken, they have to be plugged in for hours every day.   Your analysis of the ""unless"" doesn't seem necessarily wrong here, but I think Occam's razor applies. The simplest interpretation...  This is not meant to be a complicated usage of ""unless"". It's just ""if not"" used in a standard formulaic phrase to introduce an opinion. It has the same grammatical neutrality you'd see in an ""I think"" inserted anywhere into a sentence. Are these neutral phrases still called ""parenthetical""?  Second, in this sentence, the verb tense in the result clause is completely independent of the verb tense in the condition clause. In a proper conditional, the verb tense patterns in the two clauses are fixed, linked and complement each other in certain ways. That's not the case here. Even though the present tense is used in the ""unless"" clause, you could use any verb tense in the result clause:   Unless I'm mistaken, they have to be plugged in for hours every day. Unless I'm mistaken, they had to be plugged in for hours every day. Unless I'm mistaken, they will have to be plugged in for hours every day. Unless I'm mistaken, they would have to be plugged in for hours every day.   Do you see it? There's no application of the traditional conditional verb patterns here. Normal conditionals don't work like this.  Third, the meaning of a conditional is this: Condition --> Result. That relationship is missing here. The thingamabobs have to be plugged in for hours every day (or not), regardless of whatever is in the condition clause. There is simply no condition and result relationship. It's not a condition. What has to happen to the device is not conditional on the speaker's views on it.  I just don't think it's a conditional at all. This wording is just a way of saying ""in my opinion"". The introductory wording is, what, rhetorical? I'm not sure what you would call ""in my opinion"" grammatically. I think of it as a sentence opener.

I subscribe fully to the CGEL's analysis of grammar because, well, these guys spent a decade exhaustively researching, analyzing, and writing about how English grammar works. So although I find some other frameworks interesting too, I tend to defer to Huddleston and Pullum.  They spend quite a few pages talking about conditionals, but I'll focus on what's relevant to this discussion.  H&P take a much broader and more contemporary view of conditional constructions than your analysis does, and they don't even bother with traditional terminology like first conditional and so on. The key point is that there does not have to be a ""consequence implicature,"" i.e. a condition-result relationship. We can see this in conditional constructions like ""She's eighty if she's a day"" and ""If you think she's a good cook then I'm Wolfgang Puck"".  They also discuss the many combinations of time that conditional constructions can have, e.g.   If that's Amy over there, I made a very bad choice in coming here. If that's Amy over there, I'm a fool for coming here. If that's Amy over there, I will talk to her before I leave.   It's really interesting (and super nerdy) stuff."

If you don't follow the distinction, then you would always use who. There is no benefit to following the distinction as far as clarity is concerned. There are people who will judge you negatively for not observing the distinction as being uneducated or even lazy or illiterate.  Likewise there are people who will judge you for following these outdated style choices as putting on airs and being an arrogant ass.  If you care about what people think of you and your writing then you'll try to understand the context and which approach fits better. A general rule of thumb is that if it's a stuffy formal situation then observe the distinction. If it's a very casual situation with people who don't likely know/care about the distinction then just use who. Anything in between requires more thought."

And I also agree with Epi that all of whom and none of whom and to whom and the like just feel like fixed phrases, regardless of the perceived correctness or incorrectness of the grammar.

As for your and /u/Epistaxis's claim that ""all of whom"" is a set phrase, obviously I, and Google, disagree. The only set phrase that requires whom, and is now purely an idiom, is the phrase ""to whom it may concern"".  An idiom? Yes. Here's my reasoning. In two years noone will remember the meaning of whom. Three years from now the phrase will morph into ""tomb it may concern"". Obviously can is almost always preferred to may so a year later it will be ""tomb it can concern"".  I'll skip over the next few years after that but I think the evolutionary process is pretty clear. The upshot is that in ten years from today when affecting a formal tone in a note while addressing an unknown person or persons, the most acceptable greeting will be ""Toucan Sam's urn"".

For example, 'tell me as soon as you find out what time the train leaves' is arguably better then 'tell me as soon as you know what time the train leaves'; but 'tell me as soon as you know the final score in the game' is subtly better than 'tell me as soon as you find out the final score in the game'. It's not a hard and fast rule but there are subtle differences, and which choice of words sounds best depends on what is being referred to.   Sentence 4 is wrong. The only way to correct it is to get rid of 'know' ('tell me as soon as you've found out').   The construction 'you've known' is possible, but not in the example sentence. In a different kind of sentence it would mean 'you've been aware of' or 'you've had an understanding of' (not 'you've found out', as here). For example, 'I'm grateful that you've known I've been unwell this winter but didn't mention it to anyone'.

It's 4 that is incorrect in that ""as soon as"" and ""have"" cancel each other out, and the sentence means the same as sentence 3. You must understand the structure of the sentences involve an independent clause and a dependent clause. ""as soon as"" is a conjunction with the meaning of immediately. There are rules for when you use the independent clause, ""(You) tell me"" in one verb tense, and the other dependent clause, ""as soon as you finish; as soon as you have finished; as soon as you know"" in another verb tense. I don't include ""as soon as you have known"" because you don't put two contradictory elements next to each other. 4 and 3 come out as the same in meaning, but with 4 being written incorrectly. It's like saying, ""I like don't like candy."" The rules for taking the independent clause in a sentence and combining it with a dependent clause to show different verb tenses are not so much as being complicated as you have to learn, understand, and memorize them. I'll give you one example to give you an idea of what's involved:   The tense in the independent clause is Simple Present, and you want the purpose of the dependent clause to show earlier action, use the Past Tense,   ""I know that I made the right choice.""   I know = independent clause   that I made the right choice = dependent clause   There are eleven more ways like this showing different verb tenses when you are using both an independent clause as well as a dependent clause in a sentence.

I'm guessing that what the test meant by ""grammar"" is actually mostly punctuation (which for the most part has nothing to do with grammar). If you're transcribing, your grammar never comes into play; rather, you're recording the speaker's grammar. But the university probably wants you to punctuate according to the guidelines that most professional writers and publications follow (with some variation, of course).  You probably don't need a grammar refresher. You probably just need to read up on how to punctuate ""the right way."" Read the punctuation section in Garner's Modern American Usage. Or browse the Chicago Manual of Style. (Other /r/grammar regulars will likely jump in with some of their own suggestions.)   I put the right way in quotation marks up there because there really is no one right way. But like it or not, there are expectations for any sort of published writing.  For exampe, look at these two sentences you wrote:   This has been a harsh reminder, I need a refresher. I'm glad that this subreddit exists, I'll be lurking.    Both of those sentences are what style guides call comma splices, i.e., two complete sentences separated by only a comma. Now we r/grammar folks are for the most part a non-judgmental group. I personally like how you used the commas in those sentences: they give the sentences a breezy, casual kind of flow.   But once you're in a more formal situation, one in which your writing will be judged by a professor or boss or whatever, you'll have to avoid comma splices:   This has been a harsh reminder that I need a refresher. I'm glad that this subreddit exists. I'll be lurking.      Or    This has been a harsh reminder: I need a refresher. I'm glad that this subreddit exists, and I'll be lurking.

Yes, you can learn to follow grammar before punctuation. And by this I assume you mean that a singular noun gets a singular verb and so forth.

I would love to hear how a misplaced comma, which completely changes the meaning of any sentence, doesn't fall into that category.   We use punctuation to graphically represent our spoken word. Yes, the written word has taken on a life of its own which blurs this relationship but when you look at the history of orthography this relationship is clear. A comma is one kind of pause, a semicolon longer, a colon even longer, and a period very long. The idea here is that our punctuation reflects how we would speak our written words were we to do so complete with various inflections, tones, rhythms, and cadences. A ""misplaced"" comma tells the reader to speak the sentence out loud differently than what the author intended.   Grammar is about being clear and concise about what you are trying to say.

Linguists (the scientists who study language) define grammar as the observed patterns of speech of native speakers of a dialect/language. Orthography (the written word including punctuation) is a system arbitrarily created afterwards. We generally refer to punctuation and its ilk as style choices indicating, in part, that orthography is a different kind of thing than spoken language. It is the conscious invention of human minds as opposed to spoken language which evolved and was not invented (or at least not invented in the same sense as the written word).  Now in the vernacular (and what we see in schools), grammar has come to also refer to things like spelling and punctuation in addition to what linguists think of as grammar. Our contention here is that it is a useful distinction to make and given the pedantic nature of this sub it is a distinction we should make.   Grammar is not easy and most people are not good at it, but saying that punctuation and grammar are two different things is just completely false.   When looking at how linguists define grammar it turns out that everyone is actually awesome at grammar. We are all perfectly fluent in our native dialect/language. This is because our native dialects/languages are defined by how we -- its native speakers -- actually speak.

It is O.K. (all correct) in this quarter.  1839   Evening Tattler (N.Y.) 2 Sept. 2/2   These ‘wise men from the East’..are right..to play at bowls with us as long as we are willing to set ourselves up, like skittles, to be knocked down for their amusement and emolument.

grammar,3cqxlq,bfootdav,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:45:56 2015 UTC,"I think the difference is that ""OK"" (or ""okay"") is the actual word, where O.K. is the initials for ""Oll Korrect"", from which ""OK"" (or ""okay"") may have come.  In that when we say ""OK"" we are not abbreviating ""Oll Korrect"" we are saying ""OK"".. that something is acceptable.  That'd mean that while O.K. is perhaps the origin.. ""OK"" was the first form of the actual word, with the ""okay"" variant following later.  Does that make sense?"
grammar,3cqxlq,xheist,2,Fri Jul 10 14:56:06 2015 UTC,"Sure your argument makes sense but why does that result in the ""OK"" spelling being the ""most correct""?  Let's take the first four words of your response and use the earliest forms the OED lists:   Ic þenc ðe difference    Why didn't you use these spellings? They are the original forms of those words. Of course you would rightly point out that the times they have a-changed and those spellings (with one exception) are obsolete. But so? That they are no longer popular is an argument one can use but it is not logically compelling.  Okay, let's try this, which is the 'most correct' spelling color or colour? colour is the older spelling and is still used (though as an interesting side note, colur is the oldest spelling we know of). But one can create new criteria for the sake of argument. The new spelling is phonetically closer, the country where it is used has more people, that country has more money, that country has a greater military, etc. In short we can create all sorts of arguments in support of the color spelling which are just as logical but also equally as non-compelling.  O.k., let's look at the Google ngram (survey of published sources) for all these spellings.  OK is currently the most popular and was originally so. But then in the 1940s-'60s O.K. was more popular. Why doesn't that time period take precedence of the earlier or later ones? And then look at the '90s when okay was the top. Why doesn't that time period take precedence? You could just as rationally argue that any of those time periods should be the one that dictates what is ""most correct'. Or that ok has been the most consistent and it should win.  Here's the point I'm making. There is never a logically compelling reason that any language or orthographic representation thereof is the 「most correct」 version. We can create logical sounding arguments till the cows come home but that doesn't mean that any of them are compelling. You make a claim to „most correct“ then implicit in that is that your position is logically compelling. But it is only one approach among many equally valid ones.  It's 100% ok for you to have a certain preference or a certain standard/method for determining your preferred version, but please do not take the next step in thinking that your preference is «most correct»."

From the full Cambridge Grammar of the English Language:   The indefinite article a is the most basic indicator of indefiniteness for singular count  nouns. Its incompatibility with plurals is due to its historical origin as an unstressed  form of the numeral one (371).  2: Singular count nouns generally require a determiner, but is it a matter of choice whether to use a determiner or no determiner with plural count nouns? For example, both of these are valid (below), but is there any case for plural count nouns where the usage of determiners or the lack of such is obligatory? * The dogs bark. * Dogs bark.   The use of the is predicated on the concept of identifiability. Any plural noun can occur as a bare NP:   Teachers are stupid and annoying. He's always been afraid of couches. What are your thoughts on oranges?   Once the comes into the picture, I have a specific, identifiable NP in mind, and if I'm speaking to you, I assume that you are also familiar with the referent.  So it's the context that makes the determiner (or its absence) obligatory.    3: Can plural non-count nouns like the examples below occur without a determiner? * The remains are gone. * I stole these remains. * The cattle consists of cows.   I'm looking at those plural-only nouns on page 85. It seems like they can occur without determiners:   The farm raises cattle. I need scissors. We bought clothes.   A Google News search yielded hits for under auspices and found remains of..., even in reputable newspapers.  So it seems the answer to your third question is yes.   4: Also, the nouns in the examples above are fixed (and thus non-count) plurals. Are there any nouns of variable number with a plural non-count interpretation (I seriously couldn't think of any)?   That's an interesting question. I don't think so, but of course I consider your question a challenge, so I'll have to think about it!"

Meaning: He didn't run so he didn't catch the bus but if he had (or did..<- I don't know) he would have caught the bus. Is this correct?   Yes, great analysis.  Let's start with would had have. The short answer is that English does not allow would had. There is no situation in which you would use it to form a verb.  You will use would have had in two situations.  Situation One: Obligation/Necessity  We often use have to indicate something you're obligated to to:   I have to water the plants. I have to make dinner.   If you want to express a future obligation or possible obligation, you'd put will before have:   Tomorrow I will have to water the plants. If she needs a ride I will have to pick her up from work.   Just think of would have had as the version you'd use to express something you would have been obligated to do in the past (but the implication is that you did not do it):   If I had wanted the plants to grow I would have had to water them. If she had wanted a ride I would have had to pick her up from work.   Situation Two: Possession  We also use have to indicate possession:   I have several plants. I have a good job.   Here's the version where you will own (or potentially own) something in the future, again using will:   After I shop I will have several plants. If I get hired I will have a good job.   Thing of would have had as the version you'd use to express something you would have owned in the past (again with the implication that you did not):   If I had gone shopping I would have had several plants. If I had gotten/got hired I would have had a good job.   I tried to skip all the technical terms like conditional clause and modal auxiliary and other stuff that you don't have to know. Let me know if my explanation helps."

The 'have' is an auxiliary verb, which is used to make the perfect tense, which I think refers to something that happened in the past but that has an ongoing effect.  The 'would' is another auxiliary verb.  It is a modal verb, and it means that what it refers to didn't actually happened, but 'would' under other, often specified, circumstances.  Now try 'would have been having'."

You could leave who as it is, but whom is more appropriate for a book dedication, even though it might look stuffy in other contexts. The preposition at the end is just fine, however.   This is the kind of advice (who v whom) that often gets some of us into a lot of trouble here on /r/grammar. Though I'm not so positive that all book dedications require that level of formality.   Q. Hi, I wanted to ask how quotation marks would be used for a timing, for example, John Cage’s 4’3”. Because this features both single and double quotation marks, how would I quote it? Would it be ‘4’33”’ or “4’33””? Thanks in advance.  A. Confusion abounds here because minute and second marks are not quotation marks. Minute and second marks are straight and slanted (use the prime and double prime symbols: 4′33″); quotation marks are either curly (“4”) or straight but vertical (""4""). You can use quotation marks around minute and second expressions as you would any other quoted text, but if the typography gets ugly, paraphrase instead of quoting, and spell out minutes and seconds.   Are they seriously suggesting one write ""4 minutes 33 seconds"" for Cage's seminal work? I literally just turned over in my grave. Fucking heathens, they is."

But Copland, there's a crime! Not only did the man write some pretty nifty modernist pieces but also wrote some classics of Americana.

You could certainly choose to put one there if you felt that the pause achieved some effect that you're going for, but it's certainly no required.  As for the ice cream sentence: almost every person (at least here in America) was taught to put a comma before a coordinator (and, but, or and so on) that separates two independent clauses. I mean, belief in and adherence to that ""rule"" runs deep in a lot of people.  But the truth is that there is no rule written somewhere that is, like, Comma Law.  Full disclosure: I use that comma most of the time. It's deeply ingrained in me because I learned it that way, I've taught it that way for a long time, most publications adhere to its use. If you suggest here on reddit that you don't need that comma you'll have a fight on your hands and the comments will reach into the hundreds. I've thought about that comma and why I still choose to use it, and I could explain those reasons if you're interested.  But here's what you need to know: if the two independent clauses are short, you can choose to skip the comma. If the clauses start to get longish, you should probably use it. Your readers will expect to see it. But this is fiction we're talking about, and writers of fiction bend and break the ""rules"" all the time. If you want to write a short story with no commas before coordinators, then dammit, that's your right. It might give your sentences and effect or pace that you want them to have.

grammar,3chnuo,jack_fucking_gladney,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:19:43 2015 UTC,"Sure.   Although I often preach against all the stupid ""rules"" that so many of us learned in school, the truth is that the ""comma before a coordinator"" rule is one that's deeeeeply ingrained in my head. I learned it in high school and have been using it ever since (I'm 39 now). I've taught it every year during my 16 years of teaching. Every style guide I've ever read prescribes it. The rule has been, like, Inceptioned into my head. If I'm writing a compound sentence that comma appears as automatically and unconsciously as a period does at the end of a sentence. Although I won't argue that writing is supposed to reflect speech, the truth is that there is a natural pause before the coordinator. If I say to you ""I think that you should try reading Infinite Jest, but I must warn you that it's a beast of a book,"" I'm naturally going to pause briefly before the but. I like that the comma captures that pause. But if you want to skip that comma, go for it. I like the aesthetics of that comma. I feel like it gives a compound sentence balance, the same way a serial comma gives a list balance. There aren't many things that are intuitive about punctuation, but somehow marking the boundary of a complete thought is one of them. I know that complete thought is a hazy term, but the structure of English grammar gives us a pretty clear way to identify it: a verb and all of its complements and adjuncts, aka an independent clause.   I admit that I adhere to the vast majority of punctuation rules set down by style guides. (Though I use commas more loosely than most of them prescribe.) And despite their different styles and philosophies and personalities, so do /u/thundahstruck and /u/bfootdav and /u/kherux and /u/NeilZod and /u/Epistaxis and /u/knitted_beanie and pretty much everyone else who writes primarily in SWE.  When I rail against someone who fights passionately for one of those rules, it seldom has much to do with the rule itself. I just can't stand the blind adherence. For example, people argue so vehemently against comma splices, but when prodded to explain why they're so bad, all they can come up with is ""because my ninth-grade English teacher Mrs. Graybeaver and Grammar Girl say so."" And they can't see that there is nothing inherently wrong with putting a comma between two complete sentences. If you're going to argue against that comma, at least be prepared to provide some sort of semi-cogent reasoning."
grammar,3chnuo,briastkam,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:27:10 2015 UTC,"That said, do you correct your students for comma splices? Would you then say that the semicolon's primary use should only be to separate things in lists? I'd be on board for that."
grammar,3chnuo,jack_fucking_gladney,2,Thu Jul 9 04:17:50 2015 UTC,"The reason for the comma in ""...mouth, like copper."" is because the adjective prepositional phrase ""like copper"" is far removed from the word its modifying, and the comma helps to make sure the reader doesn't think ""like copper"" is modifying the word next to it, ""mouth.""   Since like copper (which is adverbial, by the way) is modifying lingers, I don't think a three-word separation will confuse too many readers. And no native speaker could possibly read that sentence and think that like copper is modifying mouth.   You could place it closer to ""taste"" but you would still need the comma, because ""like copper"" is also nonessential to the meaning of the sentence, and is more parenthetical (added information). Just because it's nonessential doesn't mean you can't add it though. Hence, the comma. These will do: The taste of blood lingers in his mouth. Like copper, the taste of blood lingers in this mouth.   Those would do if OP wanted either to A) exclude the simile they asked about in the first place or B) change the meaning of their sentence.   The taste of blood lingers in his mouth, like copper.   Again, OP could choose to include this comma, but they certainly don't have to.   For your other sentence: According to the rules, usually a short compound sentence can do without the comma: He likes ketchup but hates mustard.   Not a compound sentence. A compound sentence is a ""sentence composed of two or more main clauses joined together, but not containing any subordinate clauses"" (John E. Warriner, English Workshop: Third Course, page 129). In his English Grammar and Composition (1982), Warriner warns the reader ""not [to] confuse a simple sentence containing a compound subject or a compound verb with a compound sentence"" (130).   However, the first clause, being four words instead of two or three, ""He wanted ice cream"" inclined the editor to add the comma. Also, the editor might have felt that the relationship was weak between the two ideas (a compound sentence can be used to take two short, related ideas and combine them into one)"
grammar,3chnuo,jack_fucking_gladney,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:24:35 2015 UTC,"""The taste of blood lingers in his mouth, like copper."" The taste = article ""The"" adjective pointing out ""taste"" a noun and subject of the sentence of blood = adjective prepositional phrase modifying ""taste."" It answers the question, ""The taste of what?"" The taste of blood. lingers = is the verb in his mouth = adverbial prepositional phrase modifying ""lingers."" It answers the question, ""Where does it linger?"" In his mouth. like copper = adjective prepositional phrase modifying ""taste."" It answers the question, ""What does the blood taste like?"" It tastes like copper.   I can't figure out whether you're trolling or just that hopelessly clueless about grammar. (If it's the former, then good job. I keep getting sucked in.)  In your sentences--""What does the blood taste like?"" and ""It tastes like copper""--you've changed taste to a verb. On some level you must understand that we're talking about adverbs. The taste lingers like copper. It lingers like copper.  Do a simple substitution test. Take the original sentence: ""The taste of blood lingers in his mouth like copper.""  Write down ten adjectives and ten adverbs. Start substituting them for ""like copper."" Which ten make grammatical sense? Spoiler alert: it's going to be the adverbs.

In his English Grammar and Composition (1982), Warriner warns the reader ""not [to] confuse a simple sentence containing a compound subject or a compound verb with a compound sentence"" (130)."" Jack, you quote correctly, but you misunderstand what is being said in the quote because you don’t fully understand. I will explain. ""They liked the cake, and they took seconds home."" = *Compound sentence with two main clauses: They like the cake. They took seconds home. and = conjunction connecting the two main clauses to form one compound sentence. This is a compound subject sentence: Bill and John went to the movies together. (two subjects and one verb) This is a compound verb sentence: He laughed and cried throughout the whole movie. (two verbs: laughed, cried, and one subject ""He."") It takes practice to see the difference between the three. ""He wanted ice cream, but he was cold."" Jack, learn what a clause is and then learn the two types of clauses: From Warriner’s: 4a. “ A clause is a group of words that contains a verb and its subject and is used as part of a sentence.” 4b. “An independent (or main) clause expresses a complete thought and can stand by itself.” 4c. “A subordinate (or depenent) clause does not express a complete thought and cannot stand alone.” E.g. SUBORDINATE CLAUSES before you know it because I told him after the show is over “He wanted ice cream, but he was cold.” THE FIRST MAIN CLAUS: He wanted ice cream. (this is a complete sentence; again, also known as a main clause) He = pronoun and subject of the sentence. wanted = verb (transitive) ice cream = compound noun, direct object of the verb ""ice cream."" and = conjunction Quote: ""A conjunction joins words or groups of words"" End Quote—Warriner’s THE SECOND MAIN CLAUSE: He was cold. (this too is a complete sentence; again, also known as a main clause) He = subject Was = linking verb Cold = predicate adjective; it answers the question; “He was what?” He was cold. And = again, a conjunction joining the two MAIN clauses Now here is a compound sentence with two main clauses, each with a dual subject and dual verb : (Study it carefully) Carol and Sue yelled and jumped up and down with excitement watching the parade, and the clowns and animals fascinated and thrilled them the most. Jack, if it's anything you do for me besides making me sweat with additional labor, it's making me a review what I know. That I can thank you for."

I'm not sure that I would say it that way myself but it doesn't strike me as ungrammatical.  It's now probably a good time to make sure we're on the same page on what ""grammatical"" means. According to linguists (the scientists who study language), grammar is the observed patterns of speech of native speakers of a dialect/language. In other words by definition how native speakers speak is what defines what is grammatical.  So this construction of your friends is grammatical in that sense as it does seem like the sort of thing a native speaker might indeed utter.  Now if you were writing a formal paper an editor would insist on changing it as you've indicated. But for casual conversation I think the ""nearly more"" construction works just fine.   I know this answer probably isn't the cut'n'dried type of answer that you were looking for but that's the nature of language. What is grammatical is far more expansive than what we are typically taught in school. But whether something is stylistically preferable can be an altogether different issue and one which encourages a more rigorous and narrowly defined approach and analysis.   Also isn't something either 'more' or it's not. How can it be 'nearly more'?   We make those kinds of constructions all the time (""more unique"" etc) which when deeply analyzed do actually make sense. ""Nearly more"" says to me that there is a line where it's too much on one side and just right on the other. The ""nearly"" part means that we're right up against that line. Just ""more"" by itself means we've definitively crossed that line. We use these kinds of constructions all the time to qualify what we mean and add a kind of precision that we might not normally care about.  It's also helpful to remember that language don't logic."

From 1891:   These bones might come into order, and form a perfect skeleton, like the little one I hold in my hand, but that is all fruitless as long as there is not life.   From 1874:   Say, at least, there is not despair.   While these are not sentences by themselves I think it's pretty clear they could have been.

John went to the mall as well. Mary went to the mall as well, too.   John went to the mall as well (i.e. in addition to the zoo).  Mary went to the mall as well (i.e. in addition to the zoo), too (i.e. like John).    However, I think you mean that the person is trying to apply the idea of addition/similarity twice to an idea:   Mary went to the mall as well (i.e in addition to the zoo), too (i.e. in addition to the zoo).    This usage is something that came to my attention recently as my Maritime Canadian friends have noticed this in Southern Ontario speakers. Some have noted that it might be similar to saying ""really, really"" to express an added degree of intensity (e.g. It's really, really starting to bother me!).

Here are four results from a Google News Search (use Ctrl+F, of course, to find the phrase) for the /r/grammar folks (I imagine /u/bfootdav will find this interesting) to look at:    #1 #2 #3 #4   I grabbed only results in which both as well and too are being used to mean also or in addition. I skipped results in which there's something like Cozznester is snorting crushed-up Smarties, so I might as well, too because in a sentence like that as well is being used to mean not too but something like having a good enough reason.  The first thing I notice is that all four instances come from people who are being quoted in the articles. That is, it's not like writers and journalists have started using this construction.  It seems similar to how a double negative uses multiple markers of negation. These speakers for some reason feel like it's necessary to use multiple markers of addition.  I'm wondering whether in an example like this one   I wanted Michigan to have this opportunity based on the diversity of agriculture that we have here, manufacturing, automotive, medical, a lot of different industries that would definitely pair well with trading with Cuba in both exporting when normalization occurs and importing as well, too.   the speaker feels that the as well is coordinating all the things that Michigan as to offer, while too is tacking the whole thought onto something that she had mentioned earlier.  In this usage   That wasn't just my opinion or how I felt. It was others as well, too.   it seems like the speaker intends as well to coordinate I and others and the too to modify felt--something like other [people] and I [both] feel this way.

I'm not a linguist but it feels to me like the ""as well"" part is being added thoughtlessly as a kind of filler. More semantically meaningful than an ""um"" but just as something that gets tacked onto the end of these kinds of sentences. So from the speaker's perspective, because it's just filler, it doesn't carry the ""also"" meaning that they're looking for which is why they add the ""too"" at the end.

If the clause ""where she could keep an eye on him"" modifies ""to sit"" (an infinitive), does that mean that this is an adjective clause (assuming that the infinitive here works as a noun)?   The clause where she could keep an eye on him is the complement of the infinitive to sit; traditional grammars would indeed classify it as adverbial. Don't confuse category with function.  Just because to sit is in the category of verb does not mean it can't fulfill the function of complement of a verb (told); in this case that complement is a direct object.    And if we had something like this:  This is where Leslie was brought up.  Would you consider ""where Leslie was brought up"" still an adjective clause, or would this be an adjective phrase under one independent clause? (Since ""This is"" can't possibly stand by itself as an independent clause.)   The interrogative clause where Leslie was brought up is a predicative complement--specifically the complement of is. You're right that is in this sentence requires a complement.   I'm not sure how traditional grammars would categorize the clause. Adjective phrase? Adverb phrase? Predicate nominative? But calling it an adjective or nominal or adverb problematic because it really isn't any of those things."

Could you explain this a bit further? This was a bit confusing for me.  The way I understood it is this:  The teacher --> Subject (noun)  told --> main verb   the naughty pupil --> indirect object   to sit --> direct object (works as a noun, since it is an infinitive)   where she could keep an eye on him --> the supposed adverbial clause   Why would this be classified as adverbial when it doesn't modify a verb, adjective, or adverb? Does it still acknowledge to sit as a verb?"

Just because to sit is fulfilling the function of direct object doesn't mean that it ""works as a noun.""   Yes, it's fulfilling a function (direct object) that is most often fulfilled by a noun. But we frequently use clauses as direct objects:   I think that you should give me that cookie. I wonder why the sky is blue. I imagine that you'd like to sit down.   Just because they are in the function of direct object does not put them in the category of noun.  So just because to sit is functioning as a direct object doesn't mean that we somehow re-categorize it as a noun. An infinitive does not become a noun just because it's fulfilling a function that we typically associate with a noun, such as subject (To err is human) or direct object (I want to dance). The infinitive still maintains its verb-ness and can thus be modified by an adverb (I want to dance slowly).  Does that clear things up?"
grammar,3cb8w9,jack_fucking_gladney,2,Mon Jul 6 18:04:13 2015 UTC,"Hi. My motto: “I answer comments in grammar using “old school” grammar, which is the same as modern grammar, but taught differently. I respond only to the OP directly to avoid debate and confusion. OP makes the final decision.” You must remember that “where” is a conjunction that can be use to introduce an adjective clause or an adverbial clause or a noun clause. Its function can be: (conj., adverb, none-meaning no purpose in the clause but to introduce, etc.) and it could have a purpose too: (subject of clause, object, etc.). It depends on the clause and the way it is use. [What, when, or where are adverbs used to INTRODUCE adjective clauses in certain situations] “The teacher told the naughty pupil to sit where she could keep an eye on him.” You are correct. In your sentence, that’s just what it is: a noun clause the object of the infinitive phrase: to sit. “where” in the clause functions as an adverb, and in the case of MANY noun clauses, sometimes the PURPOSE of an introductory word is only to introduce the clause and may have no other function in the noun clause. The sentence is correct as is. Next… “This is where Leslie was brought up.” In this case, another definition of “where” is being used: as a noun meaning ‘a place, location, etc’ (check any dictionary), and “where” is the object of the prepositional phrase “up where.” What is the sentence saying? (“is” is a linking verb) SAME MEANING: “Where Leslie was brought is this.” SAME MEANING: “This is where Leslie was brought up.” The sentence is correct as is. As for... ""This is"" can stand alone as an independent clause. Sometimes one word subject and verb will do: She cried. Martin laughed. ""Is that too heavy to carry for you?"" ""It is."" ""Wow, Jim looks terrible. Is he sick?"" ""He is. He's got the flu."" ""is"" is a form of word ""be"" (be, was, is, etc.) and can be a linking verb and a helping verb or just stand alone as a verb itself (a state-of-being verb). The definition of ""is"" : Third person singular present tense of ""be."" And the first and main entry of ""be"" : 1. To exist. One more: ""Is he alive?"" ""He is.""   Hi, /u/ProfEdit25! I see you're new here, so I wanted to take a second to welcome you to /r/grammar!  I really enjoyed reading your analysis, especially of the second sentence! I think you're spot on with your assessment of where as the object of the prepositional phrase up where!

Up where were you brought?"
grammar,3cb8w9,jack_fucking_gladney,2,Tue Jul 7 03:59:36 2015 UTC,"The teacher told the naughty pupil to sit where she could keep an eye on him. If the clause ""where she could keep an eye on him"" modifies ""to sit"" (an infinitive), does that mean that this is an adjective clause (assuming that the infinitive here works as a noun)?  Looking at this again, I may have made a mistake.   ""told"" is the verb in the sentence. Many times this verb will have an  indirect object before a direct object. And I think it is that way here.   The teacher told the naughty pupil to sit where she could keep an eye on him.   ""to sit"" is an infinitive phrase acting as a noun and is the direct object of the verb told.   Recall that an adjective clause can be introduced by ""where"" which is an adverb, but also a conjunction used to connect words, phrases, or clauses.   ""Use when and where if the adjective clause is giving information about a time or place. Remember to add a subject after when or where.""--http://resources.jjay.cuny.edu/erc/tutoring/pdfs/47.pdf   So, ""where she could keep an eye on him"" is an adjective clause modifying ""to sit.""

The infinitive phrase along with the adjective clause ""where she could keep an eye on him"" makes up the entire infinitive phrase as one main idea, and that is being a noun and direct object of the verb told.   To sit is not a noun, and it's not acting as a noun. You're confusing category with function. Just because it's in a syntactical position typically filled by nouns--that of direct object--does not mean that it's a noun. It'd be the same if it were in subject position (To err is human): its occupying that position does not make it a noun.   By your logic, in this sentence   To speak Spanish fluently is one of my goals   fluently would be an adjective, since it's modifying the ""noun"" to speak. But to speak is not a noun just because it's functioning as a subject. And fluently is an adverb even though it's modifying something in the subject position.  The non-finite clause to sit where she could see him is not a noun. It's not acting like a noun. There's nothing noun-like about it. The functions of subject and object are not synonymous with noun."

Just like the person who comes from a lower socio-economic class with a heavily marked native dialect will adopt the prestige dialect in order to further their academic and professional careers, they will switch back to the native dialect when back ""home"". Otherwise they run the risk of people accusing them of putting on airs, or of being better than them, or selling out.  So yes, if your life choices have lead you to a situation where the people who have power over your academic and professional career will judge you negatively for using ""could care less"" then I feel you have made some very poor life choices.

Many languages even have different sets of personal pronouns that convey the same superficial information but indicate different levels of formality; even English used to (you vs. thou).

Yes, ""could care less"" is popular and possibly getting more popular, but there are still a large number of people who disapprove of it. Compare another idiom like ""meteoric rise"", which is equally illogical (meteors fall), but universally accepted. It's very important to know how popular a phrase is before you use it.  This is what Bryan Garner is after with his Language-Change Index, which puts ""*could care less for couldn't care less"" at stage 3 of 5, ""the form becomes commonplace even among many well-educated people but is still avoided in careful usage""; whereas another established error like ""self-deprecating for self-depreciating"" is at stage 5 of 5, ""the form is universally accepted (not counting pseudo-snoot eccentrics)"".

The language conveys the meaning to all people who are familiar with either phrasing.  Now something like ""mute/moot point"" is different because it's people mishearing a word.

Language is communication, which requires two parties. It doesn't matter if a sentence seems perfectly valid to you when your audience doesn't understand it the same way as you do. I could describe your statement as ""jejune"", but I wouldn't go around talking like that to everyone, because I know it's a rare word and not a lot of people know it; the fact that some people do know it is very distinct from the hypothetical situation where everyone knows it. Because I'm aware that it's accepted by some but unknown to many, I would choose a different word for most audiences, like ""naive"" or ""stupid"". I would be a poor speaker or writer if I used words that don't mean the same thing to my audience as they do to me.   Now something like ""mute/moot point"" is different because it's people mishearing a word. Once corrected people generally switch usage.   So you would suddenly change your position on ""could care less"" if its origin turned out to be phonetic rather than grammatical? I don't think that's a reasonable way to form an opinion about usage (do you also say ""a napron"" and ""a nuncle""?), but at any rate, Garner recommends an article with the unsearchable title ""[kũt] [kũt] Be [kũt], [kũt] It?""

Sarcasm is a well-known characteristic of this population, as found in expressions such as (possibly related) ""I should care?"" It's therefore possible that American ""could care less"" is not a wholly irrational construction, but one originating with conscious and intentional sarcasm.

I don't know what the truth is, and I doubt anyone does, or ever will.

Examples:   Until the new president was elected, Bob took upon himself to run the daily affairs of the club and so became its de facto leader. The probate court ruled that Carol had been the primary caretaker of the child for a number of years and was a de facto mother to the child. When her parents were killed in the car accident, Alice became a de facto mother, raising her two siblings.   In the context you give, the situation doesn't seem quite the same.  Environments and children aren't quite as closely linked as the elements in the examples I gave, so it seems more like a somewhat metaphorical mother, rather than a de facto mother.  A de facto X performs all the regular duties of an official X, but isn't a ""true"" X because of some technical reason, or because he lacks some official stamp of approval.

The single best test of grammaticality is if something feels natural for a native speaker. Your construction does not feel natural to any/most native speakers.  Which isn't to say that it couldn't start to feel natural and slowly work its way into become a standard feature of various dialects.  And it's also helpful to note that what many people think of as ""grammar"" (as taught in school) is actually often just ""style suggestions"" (eg, not ending a sentence in a preposition is a style suggestion and not an actual rule of grammar).

Forgive me if you're already aware of the following, but I thought it might be of use to others reading this thread.  African American's have not been given their own dialect. Their dialect, like all dialects, evolved over time incorporating new ideas, preserving some and losing others.  Everyone speaks a dialect. There is no ""proper"" grammar. No one dialect (and its accompanying grammar) is better or more expressive than any other. Standard American English is no better or more proper than African American Vernacular English. These are facts. SAE has evolved over the years just like AAVE and just like Standard British English and Irish English and Southern US English etc.  There are dialects that linguists refer to as ""prestige dialects"" which are the dialects spoken by those in a particular region who are the most powerful/wealthy/etc. Speaking in the prestige dialect marks you as a member of the elite or if you don't speak that dialect as a member of a lower class.  A dialect like AAVE not only marks one as not being part of the elite or ""prestige"" class but because of the racism that still plagues modern societies (the US in this case) speaking that dialect makes one a target of racist shits.  And while our education system should recognize this and embrace linguistic/dialectical differences, it takes the opposite approach and most often attempts to tell students that their native dialect (especially AAVE, Southern US, Bostonian, etc) is wrong or improper and makes them look stupid, backwards, and uneducated and that they need to learn the prestige dialect if they don't want those labels applied to them. Of course speaking a non-prestige dialect does not mean that someone is stupid or uneducated at all! It just means the person hasn't learned this other dialect (in addition to their native dialect) or otherwise refuses to switch (""code switch"", in linguistics terms) to it just to pander to the classist, elitist, and racist attitudes of the elite classes.  Using the ""is you"" construction if it's a natural part of your native dialect is not wrong or improper and is entirely grammatical (linguists define grammar as the observed patterns of speech of people speaking their native dialect). Within some other dialects (again, no better or worse) that construction is ungrammatical and ""are you"" is preferred (or considered ""standard"")."

So if the author really meant those are the composers, then this is just badly written, or missing some crucial context.    EDIT: This question also has a strong whiff of cultural bias.

In learning any new score, you must approach the music exactly as the composer wrote it. The conductor will give you his cuts, and if there are cadenzas, he will give you ideas about how they should be formed. Bernardo is different from David, and David is different from Roberto – that is, different conductors interpret the score in different ways – but if he is a conscientious musician, the cadenzas will never be his alone but will be built within the spirit of the music."

I assume the co-worker means to say that both you and Rosa each have an approval and a signature to give, therefore she pluralizes them. For clarification, we can expand the sentence to the following:   I have now had an opportunity to prepare the rental accounts for the year ended 5 April 2015 for you and these are enclosed for your approval [1] and signature [1].  I have now had an opportunity to prepare the rental accounts for the year ended 5 April 2015 for Rosa and these are enclosed for her approval [2] and signature [2].   I have now had an opportunity to prepare the rental accounts for the year ended 5 April 2015 for yourself and Rosa and these are enclosed for your approvals [1 and 2] and signatures [1 and 2].    The singular case also works if she is asking for your combined approval (both are needed and/or you two are a single unit/group). The signature is another matter - two people cannot physically provide a single signature very easily, but she could mean that one out of two signatures is all she needs.

You need to look up one of the eight parts of speech: the preposition.    No modern grammar claims that there are eight parts of speech. You must be using an old grammar!    The word of is usually part of what is called a prepositional phrase   Usually? I'm just wondering what else of might be part of in a sentence!    You'll learn that a preposition is followed by a noun or pronoun    Or a prepositional phrase: He came from under the bed!   Or a clause: It depends on who is coming to the party!  Or an adverb: Until recently I thought unicorns were real!   Or an adjective: This is for real!   Or nothing: Who should I talk to?!    Prepositional phrases act as either an adjective or adverb.    Which is it in On top of the fridge was an odd place to put the remote?   I know of a nice place to eat. The prepositional phrase has the preposition of in it, and it has as its noun or pronoun object the word place; the phrase is an adverb one modifying know by answering the question, ""What do I know?""    An adverb? That's a silly way to analyze something that answers what do I know? It seems like of a nice place to eat might be the complement of the verb know, specifically, perhaps, a direct object.    I like him.    That looks a lot like a verb and a direct object!

The word typical is of Greek origin, so it receives the prefix a- to form the opposite atypical. Compare asymmetrical.  The word personal is of Latin origin, and Latin has the prefix in- (and mutated forms of it, like im-) to denote the same thing. Hence, the word personal becomes impersonal. Compare impossible. There is no dictionary entry for apersonal.  The prefix a- in English words has different meanings. For words like ablaze it denotes being in a state of something or beset by something, for words like astern it can denote direction, in words like a-running it denotes the process of something. The word afraid comes from Old French effreer, meaning ""to remove peace from""[1] , so the process is different. The word afeared, however, has a slightly more English etymology[2] , where a- used to be a perfective prefix (contrary to the meaning listed here), but that meaning has since gone.  There are of course more rules, like the prefix ab- in Latin meaning ""away from"" turning into a- in some words, etc. Basically it takes a bit of studying to recognise what the prefix, or letter, a- means in a given word and how it came to be, so there isn't really a blanket rule for it."

Since the use of the serial comma is purely a matter of style and of absolutely no consequence with regard to clarity or ambiguity, it really doesn't matter which you choose. Do you put your socks on starting with your left foot or your right? It matters as little as the serial comma.  That said, if not using it would annoy your colleagues then by all that is most holy you MUST under any and all circumstances avoid using it and be one smug motherfucker about doing so!!! My motto is: the reader is the enemy. If your readers are your colleagues then this is doubly true.  Personally I switch as it pleases me to do so.

I provided such a situation and I believe another commenter did as well and it should be clear from this that it is possible to construct infinitely many more examples just like these.  Of course each of these sentences could be rewritten to avoid the ambiguity and retain the use of the serial comma but that is hardly the point as the exact same situation exists with examples of ambiguity that occur when the serial comma is not used. There is nothing special about the serial comma. It is no better (or worse) at avoiding ambiguity than not using it.  If, for some reason, as a writer you want to avoid ambiguity in your writing then you will employ various techniques to minimize ambiguity (you can never be entirely rid of it).  If in addition as a writer you value consistency, for some reason, then this constrains your strategies for avoiding ambiguities but you can still do it.  The choice of using the serial comma is one purely of style and there is no objective qualitative difference between the choices."

grammar,3bmjpn,AlenaBrolxFlami,-1,Wed Jul 1 01:43:50 2015 UTC,"It's fairly frequent that the Oxford comma can cause confusion: ""I went to the movie with my sister, Allison, and my brother.""  Written in this way, I could be going to the movie with (a) three people: my sister and a person named Allison and my brother, or (b) two people: my sister, whose name is Allison, and my brother.  There's no confusion if you drop the Oxford comma when talking about three people: ""I went to the movie with my sister, Allison and my brother."" Dropping the Oxford comma actually added clarity.  The defense of the use of Oxford commas is almost always a defense of lazy writing, while dropping the Oxford comma as a practice will in fact help promote clear writing. At normal speaking rates, in which you're not deliberating every pause, no one hears your Oxford comma, so you must orally communicate with people clearly. If what you say is confusing, a mental comma won't help you — you need to rephrase. An Oxford comma is the same crutch. Everyone knows from context alone that ""the strippers, JFK and Stalin"" doesn't mean the stippers are JFK and Stalin; it's a stupid argument. But further, if there's actual confusion there, then you invited ""JFK, Stalin and some strippers."" The solution isn't lazy, unclear writing that adds a comma to make it ""the strippers, JFK, and Stalin,"" it's to rewrite to communicate clearly.    To eliminate the Oxford comma is to train yourself to be a better communicator.  (Note: I'm a 20-year slave to AP style.)"

While I absolutely agree with your comment, it doesn't prevent it from happening or negate the argument that appositive clauses and Oxford commas often look identical, or the argument that the Oxford comma doesn't assist with clarity. I removed it and nothing changed — how is that an argument in favor of the comma?  I believe it's far more reasonable to consider that someone may unthinkingly structure a sentence in the way I suggested than would actually think you're speaking to your toast and orange juice, telling them you ate eggs (or that your parents are Ayn Rand and God) — which goes back to my aforementioned note about irrational arguments based on unreasonable inability to parse context to defend the use of the extra comma."

It means, in its first definition, not able to be used or obtained.  As such, in its more standard meaning, it's not very suited to being used for a living, possibly thinking person.  The Oxford dictionary does not provide a second meaning. Many online resources offer a seconed meaning of unavailable for work, which makes me think it's an idiom that we're just keyed to accept.  This strikes a chord with my interpretation of the two: I am unavailable all afternoon is passive and sounds right. I am unavailable for that meeting also sounds right. I am unavailable to perform that action loses the diffuse sense of the passive voice, and grates on my nerves.  That's the sense I can make of it. I'd like to see a more authoritative voice weigh in here."
