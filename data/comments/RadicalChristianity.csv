RadicalChristianity,3e4wqo,commanderjarak,13,Tue Jul 21 23:56:38 2015 UTC,"I'm personally a committed pacifist, and I suggest this is something you shouldn't worry about.  Contrary to popular (i.e. nonpacifist) discourse, how you act in that situation has nothing to do with pacifism.  This may sound weird, but let me explain.  Pacifism is about the practice of how you live your life right now, not some hypothetical future.  Right now, you're not in the moral conundrum you described.  Right now, you're just sitting at your computer, probably bored.  Right now, you have three possible actions you can take:   You can do something of no moral importance.  Most of us choose this action most of the time. You can train for that future combat scenario you describe.  I'm using the word ""train"" pretty loosly here.  It doesn't just mean target shooting with your handgun at the local range.  It also means watching ""violence porn"" (i.e. most action movies), since this desensatizes you and prepares you for the more useful training. You can directly make the world a more peaceful place.  This might involve feeding the homeless, tutoring school children, or befriending an Iranian.   Soldiers spend very little time in actual combat.  Instead, they spend tons of time preparing for combat.  Right now, the soldier is choosing option number 2.  The idea of pacifism is to replace all the number 2 actions in your life (and much of the number 1 actions as possible) with number 3 actions.  This is how pacifists make the world a better place---by making it more peaceful right now, not in some hypothetical future.    As an aside, I used to be a submarine officer in the US Navy.  I left as a conscientious objector because I thought Jesus was calling me to pacifism.  It took me a long time to wrestle with questions like yours, and it's okay if it takes you a long time to wrestle with them as well.  I think pacifists too often just dismiss non-passifists without properly wrestling with the issues.  Anyways, I had to do a pretty extensive interview to get conscientious objector status, and in the interview I was asked many of these questions.  I've put the transcript online at: https://izbicki.me/blog/co-testimony-the-development-of-my-beliefs.html"
RadicalChristianity,3e4wqo,PokerPirate,2,Wed Jul 22 00:31:01 2015 UTC,"The Old Testament has stories about God telling the Israelites to do all these crazy things during battles that would actually weaken them.  But God is asking them to trust and it'll all work out. Similarly, the idea in Christian pacifism is that you trust that your own strength, gun, knife, BJJ isn't what Jesus wants you to use.  You need to trust in God and follow Jesus' path of radical justice and love. The other part of all of this, at a more rational level, is that the cycle of violence is what perpetuates more violence.  So hurting someone else because they might hurt you or someone you love is expanding the cycle of violence and making it more difficult for the offender to heal and rejoin the community as a valued member."

RadicalChristianity,3e45gy,Demon_Nietzsche,2,Tue Jul 21 20:34:02 2015 UTC,"Has anyone read this book? It might interest some readers here.   Abstract:   What if there is no God out there, but a divine creativity down here? Through philosophers Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze, Mysticism as Revolt explores faith without the transcendent God of Christian orthodoxy. Foucault and Deleuze address some of the most frequently debated issues in contemporary theology; their thoughts on representation, however, deserve an exhaustive exploration. The author allows the most anti-religious aspects of Foucault’s and Deleuze’s thinking to encounter Christian theology, and examines what Christian theology could be without the oppressive features of representational logic, suggesting that contemporary theology should perhaps not leave its metaphysics behind but understand its task differently. A “post-representational theology” would note the creative force of form, dogma, truths, authorities, eternal gestures and church buildings, but it would not believe in their final power. A post- representational perspective, the author argues, could open up a playful yet serious form of Christian resistance: mysticism as revolt. To repeat, parody and play with whatever comes to the fore as eternal, or as the truth of concrete experience – both when reading and when doing theology – in order to make room negatively for those realities, actual but unknown, unthinkable yet possible, that no language could ever capture. Mysticism as Revolt contains unique analyses of Thomas Altizer, Graham Ward, and Katherine Keller and introduces the theology of Emilia Fogelklou for an English-speaking audience."

The contrast is a vivid reminder of just how far Pope Francis has to go in realizing his vision of a Church that spends less time condemning people over abortion, contraception, and who they marry, and more time fighting for the trampled victims of a highly unequal and unjust economic system.   I've found myself getting a lot of milage out of ""I'm not interested in ... "" as a response to people calling me to speak out on issues (especially righty issues). I'm especially uninterested in ""reclaiming Biblical masculinity"" in any sense that doesn't strongly feature self-sacrifice and humility, but, when I'm being politic, I'm also deeply ""uninterested"" in ringing alarm bells over just about anything having to do with ""traditional"" ideas of sexuality or gender.

A  vegan diet may be great for personal satisfaction, perhaps even salvation, but it does jack-all for the actual problems, which require collective action on more fundamental issues.  And honestly, i find producing eco-communism a more realistic enterprise than eliminating the aeons-old practice of meat consumption.  btw, that article is really strange, in that the most immediate solution would be to kill all the livestock, since the problem is their breathing, rather than meat-alternatives.  #endbovinebreaths"
RadicalChristianity,3e2jgx,Dragon9770,3,Tue Jul 21 15:19:15 2015 UTC,"does jack-all for the actual problems   That is bullshit. As the article I posted states, 51% of emission is caused by meat eating. Something like 70% of the water that we use is used on agriculture. It take 100 to 200 times more water to produce a pound of beef than it does to produce a pound of vegetables. The UN has urged the world to go vegan. Yes, capital is implicit in the destruction of the world, but I don't see how we can undermine capitalism without going vegan. We cannot feed the 9 billion people (who will exist in the future) on a meat eating diet without destroying the environment. Hell, we can't feed the 7 billion people today on a meat eating diet without destroying the environment. There is no such thing as sustainable meat. There is no such thing as meat that is good for the environment (aside from, maybe hunting). So, no, veganism is not a personal issue. If everyone went vegan it would substantially alter our impact on the world's ecology.    the most immediate solution would be to kill all the livestock   That is actually something that has been considered acceptable by animal rights groups. Many of the livestock that exist shouldn't exist and could never live in the wild.   More  Edit: I'll admit that while I would argue that killing animals is ethically wrong, this is a premise that can be argued with. Yet, I don't think you can argue against the ecological reasons for going vegan.

That is what is lacking, and it is that collective conscious that needs to ""go vegan,"" not individuals.    It is the same dynamic as Thomas Piketty's ""solution"" in Capital in the Twenty-First Century to the wealth-inequality: institute a high global wealth tax.  The only reasonable response is ""so what you are telling me is all we need is a centralized global hegemony of at least social-democrats who are uncorrupted by the capitalist class to institute a single social-welfare system globally?  That will be easy and won't in any way involve traditional class-warfare!""  I am incredibly suspicious of falling into vulgar reductionist-economism, but all these silver-bullets like global veganism, 3d printers, thorium reactors, etc. are all just so narrow-minded and many of the liberals who propound them don't realize their imminent utopias require the brute democracy and class warfare politics to make these ""solutions"" into actually-workable and effective programs.

That kind of burned me out on him for a bit, but I still think his work is valuable, particularly his ontology. Professionally, I don't always explicitly reference him in my other work now, but that commitment to both a radical materialism and some sense of human agency is always there in the background. Personally, I find the ethics that he attempts to derive from that ontology very compelling, though I've wondered about the extent to which it ends up being a repetition of earlier existentialism--and I simply haven't yet read enough Kierkegaard, etc. to get a sense of that."

But I doubt, Zizek will be bound by tradition, at least of the existentialists, in my opinion, and although I see an influence of Heidegger in his writings.

This is a material, messy, all too human community of course.   Peter Rollins on the other hand doesn't seem to want to weigh in on wether God is actually dead or even existed in the first place as much as he seems to stress the felt absence of God's presence.

RadicalChristianity,3dp88e,2pacJesus,-2,Sun Jul 19 00:43:40 2015 UTC,"But for Christians it will require a re-acquaintance with the Old Testament narrative. Rather than a pejorative view of the Old Testament as a flaccid introduction to the more important “climax” known as the New Testament, Christians should humble themselves in the face of Israel’s history as it makes gentile inclusion a real possibility.[12] Further still, as our authors have pointed out, it will only be by rooting itself in Israel’s unique theopolitical identity that Christianity will be able to exorcise the demons of white supremacy.  King James Bible And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean. Acts 10:28  To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. 10:43  You only need to take the time to understand the new testament and everything becomes clear. You don't start by dismantling the system from the top down, we each do it one by one, starting with ourselves and spreading it. I feel your friend has not read the new testament in its entirely as many christians have not. The teachings in the bible are meant to be taken in context. The people spouting hate and teaching hate are being misled by wolves in sheep clothing. We starting teaching and sharing as individuals living in the path of Jesus and people will come, and when we seek them they will listen. We have got to start being true to Gods path ourselves before we can begin to change others. People need to get back in touch with God and read the new testament for themselves and discuss it with people they love and trust that are involved in their lives. Listening to what others teach will only get you so far.  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Ephesians6:12"

This includes newcomers who may be ignorantly oppressive. networks people together to work on collaborative and creative projects. exposes me to the realities of my unexamined privilege and how my faith might change accordingly. hosts practical and abstract approaches and products of radical Christianity in productive tension.   Negatively stated   resists capitalism explicitly, including the oppressive discourses that perpetuate it. refuses to tolerate reactionary and conservative positions as legitimate discourses on equal footing with radical alternatives. eschews the general conversations about Christianity that could be reasonably had elsewhere, unless there are special circumstances like an AMA or a user looking in good faith to hear a radical perspective on those issues.   Some of those goals are clearly hard to parse, but there they are."
RadicalChristianity,3dnffe,episcop-alien,3,Fri Jul 17 20:10:12 2015 UTC,"Tricky. Good stuff, though.   Many communities have failed due to your observation above. I still haven't distinctly found community yet. Finding a tradition for me is, more or less, just picking out who does God best. So, I've been trying to create my own context instead of capitulating to shit I don't like all the time. It's harder, but worth the extra effort. Although I'm also noticing that the more I try to leave my stereotype, the more I find myself right back there. I still struggle with it. Sometimes you must make your own stream. My thoughts lately.  edit: I should add, we know how to do our process, but we haven't exactly spelled it out for others. Map, bread crumbs, etc. Looking forward to your inputs."
RadicalChristianity,3dnffe,Demon_Nietzsche,3,Fri Jul 17 19:15:07 2015 UTC,"On radicalism  I see as the point of this community the ability to question topics that we aren't allowed to question. Did God die? Does God's existence matter to Christianity? Can anarchy/communism/post-structuralism/etc work within a Christian understanding? Does God/xianity still matter? How can we come to grips with Xianity while disagreeing with the mainstream narrative of what constitutes Xianity? These are important questions to ask, and this space provides an area where they can be discussed without ridicule from accepted norms and traditions. You are allowed to question Christianity without taking on the framework of atheism, for instance. I think that this is important to keep, and I think that is part of what makes us radical.   Does what we're doing still work?  Maybe. I think that as spend more and more time interacting with new ways of understanding Christianity, it becomes commonplace and normalized. This is natural and isn't bad. What does come out of this is that we forget how different the way that we think is from the mainstream. We forget how a place like this can seem from the outside, and we forget what it is like to be that person who doesn't have a community within which they can ask the sort of questions that we ask here. I constantly forget that there are areas in this country (and the one south of here) where you can be assaulted for being queer. For someone coming out of a more closed community, this place can be welcoming and necessary. In this sense it is critical for us to keep doing what we are doing.   On conservativism   This isn't really related to the original question, but it's related to /u/TheBaconMenace comment. There seems to be an underlying thread of leftism within this community, which makes sense, given the voices that speak here (anarchists, communists, etc.). I've been thinking about the way that we talk about left v. right ideologies and they don't really make sense. In a sense, the world I envision is a lot more conservative that either the neo-liberal or liberal conceptions that exist in mainstream politics. I'm in favor of small communities of people working together to live fulfilling lives. Perhaps, in that sense, I am like Heidegger. I consider myself left wing because I believe in emancipation and liberation, but my ideal world doesn't look all that different from what some of my more conservative friends ideal world's looked like. In this way I'm not sure that we should be dismissive of more conservative viewpoints. I don't want to open the door to bigoted voices, or sexist voices, or racist voices, or transphobic voices, etc. We're also not interested in biblical literalists. These are the voices we want to keep out when we suggest we don't want ""conservative voices"", but I don't think that there is anything inherently wrong with ""conservativism"". Like, Foucault, in a sense, could be considered kind of conservative. Not in modern politics, but maybe in a more nuanced understanding of what a conservative is. I don't know, I'd be interested in other thoughts."

RadicalChristianity,3dnffe,Rad_q-a-v_,5,Tue Jul 21 02:03:10 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like I can't posit where this community should go but maybe provide some insight towards what I feel is the status quo of the Sub.  For my perspective: This isn't a terribly small sub and generally speaking the content seems to be much more qualitative than nearly every other sub that I frequent; the same goes for the community - despite there being 4k subs I recognize most names enough to have an idea what the comment will be about before actually reading it; further somehow all of the comments (from whomever) seems to be at least partially constructive or at least interesting; very little trolling.  So, maybe the core of this community is feeling the need to re-define itself in light of the whole reddit debacle, but from my long-term lurking and short-time activity I don't identify anything that needs to be changed but maybe (seriously, maybe) rather start an official stickied ""This is us and this is what we (don't) believe"" thread -- however perilous that might be in a community as vague and shifting as ""Radical Christianity"".  I will say, as a queer person, I'd like an easily reference-able source of writing and thoughts on what the subs stance is on ""Gayness"" but more appropriately (and broadly) on ""Queerness"" is/should be. There is explicitly no homophobic/transphobic discourse stated in the rules but that doesn't really tell me much. The one thread that is on the side bar can be nice depending on the comment that you choose to read, but is 2 years old and the most useful comment establishing this is ""Straight people should just listen"". Once again like the rules, this is nice but doesn't really tell me much. I think it'd be really useful to have in-thread comments establishing what the prevailing thoughts are (by the mods -- I'm talking a green/side-bar official thread), and any theological writings that could be linked as well. For me, Queerness is so divisive (especially within the Christian community) that it's deserving of it's own thread and side-bar attention more than it has already been given."
RadicalChristianity,3dnffe,Demon_Nietzsche,3,Sat Jul 18 20:49:34 2015 UTC,"On the sub's stance on ""queerness"", I think that my policy, personally, is that I'm a straight, cis, white guy, and so I feel really, really uncomfortable with being the person who gets to decide what the stance is. I feel like any attempt to create a rigid barrier by someone like me has the potential to be offensive and hurtful to someone who is queer.   If I were to come up with a stance it would be something along the lines of ""If you have a problem with anyone because of their gender identity or sexual preference fuck you don't talk about it here. We are open and affirming of all LGBTQ+/GSRM individuals. There is nothing wrong, unnatural, or sinful about being LGBTQ+/GSRM."" But I would prefer if someone who was queer (or at least not Cissexual White Heterosexual Male) who was writing/implimenting that stance. That way it wouldn't seem as colonial."

RadicalChristianity,3df1e1,arcrius11,2,Wed Jul 15 19:33:41 2015 UTC,"Tangentially related, but here's something God ""spoke"" to me--  I was meditating one cool spring morning, sitting on a bench staring eastward.  A lone tree was illuminated by the sun, and I gazed in wonder at the dappled leaves.  Suddenly, I heard these words--  ""Notice the tree has parts that are exposed to the light while some parts remain in darkness. Throughout the day, although the sun moves westward, some portion of the tree will still be in darkness.  The only way for the tree to be fully illuminated is for the light source to come from within the tree.  So it is with humans.  If Christ remains some external figure or some loving Father up in heaven, we will never vanquish the darkness within us.  Only by internalizing the light will we find our true identity as children of God.""  John 15:4 states, Remain in Me, as I also remain in you.  If we are in Christ and Christ is in us, then there can be no distinction between Christ and us.  No longer are we separated from God; instead, we are the Light."
RadicalChristianity,3df1e1,frychu,2,Thu Jul 16 08:00:14 2015 UTC,"So good.  Very interesting and mysterious concept.  I don't know any Hebrew or Greek, but I happen to be very interested in spiritual identity.  Here are a few verses I know of elseware in the Bible that seem to support the idea.     John 20:17  [Jesus said to her, “Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”] Jesus claims that the disciples and himself are of the same father. Romans 5:19  [For as by the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous.] - The letter to the Romans was addressed to ""those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints.""  This is why he says ""will be"" made righteous (because his audience was not when he wrote the letter). Galatians 2:20 [I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.] - Paul claims that he is dead and the person that exists in his place is Christ who is divine. Ephesians 1:3-5  [Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, 4 even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love 5 he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, 6 to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved.] - Ephesians, contrary to Romans, was addressed ""To the saints who are in Ephesus, and are faithful in Christ Jesus.""  Paul writes that they are spiritually blessed with every blessing, holy, blameless,  and sons of God.  Holy means ""set apart.""  Jesus is holy.  Paul is claiming that they are the same as Jesus in spirit. Ephesians 2:19 [So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God] - Paul says the Ephesians are citizens of heaven Ephesians 5:8 [For once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of Light [lead the lives of those native-born to the Light].] - The saints of Ephesus who were once in darkness are now are now native-born to the light. Matthew 5:14 [“You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.] - Jesus confirms/initiated the light part. Colossians 1:13 [He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son,]  - Colossians is also addressed to saints.  Paul claims that we not only are light, but we also dwell where God is.  Colossians 1:18 [He (Jesus) is the firstborn from the dead] - No one was ever brought to life before Jesus resurrected.  Jesus raised several people to life, so this only makes sense if it is talking about on the spiritual level. Colossians 1:21-23 [And you, who once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, 22he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him, 23if indeed you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard] - A repeat of what was said in Ephesians, the faithful are holy, blameless above reproach. Colossians 2:13 [And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,] - The faithful were dead.  Now, they ARE alive together with Jesus.   Colossians 3:3-4 [For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. 4When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.]  Christ is our life.. wut.  We appear when he appears.. wut. 1 Corinthians 5:9-11 [Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, 10 nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.] - The letter to the Corinthians was addressed to ""the Church of God in Corinth.""  Paul writes that the Corinthians (who he claims have been performing really bad sins in the same letter) are saints and have been sanctified.  In doing so, he claims that actions do not define spiritual identity.   1 Corinthians 6:17 [But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him] - Pretty clearly stated 2 Corinthians 2:15 [For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing] - Saints smell like Jesus. 1 Peter 1:15-16 and 22-23 [But as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, 16 since it is written, “You shall be holy, for I am holy.”] [Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart, 23 since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God] - Peter confirms that ""the elect"" are supposed to be holy.  He also states that ""the elect"" have a pure heart and have been born of the seed/sperm of God. 2 Peter 1:3-4 [His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, 4by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.] ""To those who have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours,"" we can become partakers of the divine nature which we have been granted. Jude 1:24 [Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy,] - Jude agrees that ""those who are called"" are able to live without stumbling and are blameless before God. 1 John 3:2 [Dear friends, we are already God's children, but he has not yet shown us what we will be like when Christ appears. But we do know that we will be like him, for we will see him as he really is.] - Our likeness to God will clearly manifest upon his appearance. Bonus:  Romans 8:19 [For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God.] - Creation wants us to manifest our divinity.   The Bible makes a pretty strong argument that we are partakers in the divine nature if we believe and do not shift from the hope of gospel.  One clarification; you have asked if ""everyone"" is a manifestation of the divine.  These verses allude to a transaction that must take place before the divine nature is manifest, and that not all men will manifest divinity.  I apologize if that was more information than you would have wanted.  I hope for this post to be encouraging.  I have been meaning to compile some of these verses for a while now and I just happened to do it in response to your post."

RadicalChristianity,3df1e1,solxyz,2,Thu Jul 16 06:10:45 2015 UTC,"This wikipedia page shows 12 of the earliest church fathers stating in the clearest possible terms that the meaning of Christianity is for humans to become gods/sons of god. The Orthodox Church largely preserves this understanding (more clearly than any of the western churches, although the dogma can still be found within Catholicism, but in a kind of buried and de-emphasized way), holding that theosis is the aim of the path. But then of course there is the desire to hold the idea that Christ was at the same time god in an entirely unique way, and so there is a lot of verbal contortion: ""we become only by adoption what he is by nature,"" ""we are creatures, while Christ is pre-eternal and begotten,"" etc, etc. I dont entirely buy it.  This has not yet addressed the other possible objection: that the Church is saying that we should be following a path to become divine, while Christ seems to say that we already are. This part doesnt bother me. First of all Christ also suggests that our divinity is at the same time not quite what it should be, when he prays ""that they will all be one, Father, just as you and I are one"" (John 17:21). Second this is a basic paradox, familiar to me from the buddhist world, in which we are both already the enlightened living truth and at the same time we still need to realize that truth. And quite frankly, I think that most forms of Christianity, esp. in the protestant world, focus too heavily on the ""already accomplished"" side of salvation, neglecting the intense amount of spiritual work that is really involved in this process. There is a reason that St. Anthony spent his life in a desert in ascetic labor and prayer, and there are spiritual heights which are achieved through that kind of life that dont result from saying ""ok, thanks god. now i guess ill kick back and have a beer."""
RadicalChristianity,3dbx57,Demon_Nietzsche,12,Wed Jul 15 01:57:49 2015 UTC,"Hello comrades, I have lurked on this subreddit for a while now, and I have always found something interesting/challenging to think about for the rest of the day. It is probably my favourite subreddit.  Here is a slightly long introduction : I grew up in Nepal where my parents were missionaries, so, I guess, poverty and oppression are familiar sights. During our time there, the Maoist revolution took place, so I have somewhat of a connection with radical politics. Riots and red flags brandishing the hammer and sickle were common sights. My family left Nepal six years ago, and moved to Malaysia where life was a little bit easier. Malaysia has a large population of Nepali migrant workers who were often forced into terrible working conditions and had their passports taken away, thus ensuring they could not leave the country. I got to work with a lot of these Nepalease workers and see many of them come to Christ. To me, they have always served as examples of what the Christian walk should look like. In Nepal, many of them became martyrs or were imprisoned. Whenever I think of them, I remember a phrase from a letter written by a Nepali in jail, it was something to the effect of: ""The chains on our feet are the ornaments of Christ and the rags on our bodies are the garments of His Glory"" This phrase has always served as a good example of what I desire for my faith.  In the past couple years, I have started reading a lot of philosophy (My favourite would probably Kierkegaard and recently I have been reading a lot of Zizek) and after discovering the concept of the objective violence of capitalism, I realize I have been witnessing it all my life.  We just moved back to the States, and I am having trouble fitting in with life here. I feel suffocated by all the consumerism. I want to live a radical life of service here, but I don't know where to start. Recently, I discovered Catholic Worker Houses, and they seem like a good fit for me, but I am about to start college. I feel as though I cannot live the life I am called to live.  Anyways, thanks for reading my half introduction/half rant. RadicalChristianity has provided me with a place to grow in my faith and discover the radical implications of my faith in Christ, so I want to thank you all."

I'm a hardcore systems-thinker who can't stand to not be constantly learning so as a result I enjoy spending a lot of my time reading philosophy/critical theory; and I've just recently become interested in theologians such as Caputo, Rollins, and Tillich.  I'm most influenced by Paulo Freire as a framework for liberation; Emma Goldman is my favorite Anarchist from whom I draw a lot of inspiration from. And Arne Ness's work in Deep Ecology has deeply affected me and the way I relate myself to the world.  I grew up fairly fundamentalist Christian through my adolescence and then came at an impasse when my (parents) belief system wholly rejected my sexuality. I've since come to identify as an ""Agnostic Atheist"" insofar as that I don't believe there is a God but feel uncomfortable about holding my beliefs in any sort of concrete or static way; Recently I've been drawn to Caputo's ""Weak Theology"" and general intensive deconstruction of Christianity.  Overall, it seems that I'm drawn to radical Christian types (Freire, Kierkegaard) before I even know they are the radical Christian types.

There were things I really liked about each, but there were always things that hugely confused me about Christian doctrine.  Luckily, I was  inspired by an awesome dude who shared with authority an answer to basically every question I had about Christianity.  Most of the people who heard rejected his message, but I had been praying for it for years.    Since then, about 2 years ago, I  have started to actually believe what the Bible says about my ""saved"" identity over what people have told me, and more importantly, over what I myself believe.  For example, the Bible says I am holy and righteous, today.  I don't see that in my life but I trust God that it is true.  If that is not ""radical Christianity"" or ""revolutionary politics"" then I don't know what is!  This way of thinking has taken a lot of humility and a lot of people have told me I'm out of line, but it is having a profound effect on my life.  I no longer struggle with depression, I am noticeably being set free from immorality which has bound me for years, I no longer need acceptance or support from a pastor or a church to be encouraged in my faith and I no longer ""need"" or rely on ""worship music"" of the Western culture to take me back to a place of worship, I am getting to a place where you can't offend me (because I know who I am and I know your created value, and that you wouldn't have done something offensive if you knew who you were.  ""Well, they should have known better"" I used to think.  Really?  Well then, I should know better than to get offended at something that they should have known better than to do... right?)    Today, I go to church to love people, not to receive love.  Lastly, I have started to see ""signs and wonders,"" but not to prove anything to myself or anyone else, but because I believe the scripture that says, ""these signs will follow them that believe."" I'm excited to share ideas with you all and re-invest Christianity with its transgressive elements!"
RadicalChristianity,3dbx57,solxyz,3,Wed Jul 15 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"Glad to have you! My own journey involved significant time in Baptist and charismatic churches, and those experiences led me to a revolutionary political position. Owning your identity as irrevocably good enough and worthwhile is a great blessing and I hope it leads you to a confident outworking of your gifts and calls. That's a truly radical position, and one many of us here (myself included) are still struggling to embody."
RadicalChristianity,3dbx57,CrowdisUntruth,2,Wed Jul 15 22:23:29 2015 UTC,"Owning your identity as irrevocably good enough and worthwhile   That's a pretty good way of saying it!  It wasn't too hard to get there, I just skipped the step you are on.  The Bible says that we have this treasure in jars of clay.  Instead of focusing on the ""human"" aspect of my being which in its weakness can accumulate imperfections and short comings quite easily and quickly, and is temporary and wasting away (the Jar), I am choosing to focus on the treasure within (the glory of God).   I'm not a theologian or great thinker or anything, more of a business man.  In business the greater you believe your potential to be, the more success you will have.  A popular example is from school, if you think about your favorite teacher (if you had one), he or she probably viewed you as much smarter than you actually were.    I'm fairly certain God sees us as a 10/10.  He sees our potential which is to become and multiply his image.  It's pretty clear that Jesus saw that after he resurrected and then went to the upper room with a bunch of afraid, good for nothing, unbelieving disciples. He tells these guys that they are the ones chosen to carry on his very own ministry.  This principal is also true for the Corinthians who go from terrible sinners to sanctified saints after just one visit from Paul.  God looks at the treasure that we potentially are.    If we identity ourselves by examining our lives at any point in time then our identity will go up and down like a roller coaster along with life circumstances.  The whole solid foundation idea talked about in the Bible will be just that.. an idea that others won't care about.  Also, sorry to downplay the revolutionary political way of thinking.  I didn't even realize that was a people group.  I'm interested to learn more about it."

(b) i dont want to start any fires here, but my sense is that the ecological and global politico-economic issue are bigger issues in terms of the overall depth of suffering and oppression involved, but maybe thats just because i live in a culture sphere where birth control is taken for granted, and gay rights are not that far behind.

RadicalChristianity,3d7cua,solxyz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"I get where you are coming from, and I agree that these issues likely have much larger implications than other issues (in that if these issues aren't solved, other issues won't matter). That said, I think it is problematic to simply praise the pope, without being critical of the things that he does wrong. What good is an ecologically and politically stable world that still functions within patriarchy and heteronormativity?  From my experience one of the biggest qualms that feminists have against more radical groups (marxists, anarchists, etc) is that they want women to put their struggle behind in favor of tearing down the system. The problem is that its men who are telling them to do this, and denies that there are structural advantages even within these groups (which there are)."
RadicalChristianity,3d7cua,Demon_Nietzsche,2,Wed Jul 15 01:28:28 2015 UTC,"agreed. although we should distinguish two different kinds of feminists who might have a problem getting involved with radicalism. the first objects because of seeing persistent sexism/genderism/etc within the radical community or within their proposals for action and society. that is, this kind of feminist is making a feminist critique of the radical community and its intentions. to this feminist i say ""bring it on."" we should hear these critiques and continue to uproot whatever hidden oppression is lurking amongst us. although i must say, at least in the circles that i travel in, i think that our communities can be pretty damn good on this front.  the second kind of feminist would rather not be involved with radicalism because of a sense that such involvement weakens their ability to pursue feminist objectives within the current social context and power structure. to this feminist, i dont know what to say. we all have to balance the pursuit of liberation with making a functioning life in the world as it exists, and i certainly dont have any moral high ground to tell people where that balance should be. on the other hand, there is also the possibility of self-deception in which one is actually more interested in advancing ones own position within a system of oppression than in dismantling the  system of oppression."

Capitalism has centered the capital surplus in the hands of corporate entities, which has led them to become more powerful, allowing them more control over politics, which has led to an even more neo-liberal landscape, in which more and more surplus is accumulated in the hands of capital (perpetuating the cycle).   So, yeah, it is capitalism that we are looking at.  Edit: From your comment history I am guessing you prescribe to an-capitalism. I'm curious about how this fits with your faith? How do you connect the two? I personally cannot see capitalism as anything other than greed based, which to me seems antithetical to Christianity, so I am really curious."

From my (brief) readings it seems that is more of an organizing social structure that fits into broader ideologies. I'm quoting wikipedia, so take it for what you will:     Corporatism is related to the sociological concept of structural functionalism. Corporate social interaction is common within kinship groups such as families, clans and ethnicities. ... Corporatist types of community and social interaction are common to many ideologies, including—absolutism, capitalism, conservatism, fascism, liberalism, progressivism, reactionism. Corporatism may also refer to economic tripartism involving negotiations between business, labour, and state interest groups to establish economic policy. ... ""   Maybe the last bit about the economic triparism, but to be honest I don't really think the labor is involved all too much, and something more like a Neoliberal structure (involving private and state decision-making apparatus') being in place is probably more realistic to consider."

Lessons I for one am thankful to receive.   Again, I might agree with yours and countless others material analysis yet still hold solidarity to the stand, however wobbly, fearful and reactionary it might (or might not) have been.  Isn't this the better dialectic than just criticizing from afar without skin in the game? This need not be another tired orthodoxy verse orthopraxy either.   Yes, this is exactly what solidarity is, a messy, filthy, compromised, dialectical praxis striving towards a better orthodoxy.  Not orthodoxy looking for a clean praxis to comfortably endorse.   Egalitarianism is not what ‘comes after’ the fight, it is the fight itself, i.e. egalitarianism is ‘a product of the very struggle for it’.  Edit: Grammar."

RadicalChristianity,3d35wq,sillandria,8,Mon Jul 13 03:48:19 2015 UTC,"I grew up in a similar upbringing, although the Protestant churches I grew up with next to my mother weren't quite as extreme. Like you, I had a pretty catastrophic break with Christianity because the Christianity I knew just couldn't be compatible with what I was learning about the world, whether that was about natural science, sexuality, history, and my own developing political and philosophical opinions. It led to some difficulties with my mother, who was incredibly distraught when I left the faith, but her love for me as her child and my love for her as my mother transcended religio-sectarian lines, which I was very lucky to have.   There likely isn't any certain way to go about it, and everyone goes about it differently. For me, my return to Christianity started with Nietzsche, who I thought saw what Christianity was rather clearly. I just happened to disagree with him on his evaluation of Christian values. What was important for me in my encounter with Nietzsche was that it made become rather self-conscious, for the first time, about how much of Christianity was still left inside me and that not all of it was really a bad thing. In a way you could say that it was Nietzsche that led me to ""recover my Christian self."" But I don't think it's all that useful to continue with the explicit thought of recovering your ""Christian self"" as much as you should try thinking about the relationship between yourself and Christianity. If that leads you to recovering a ""Christian self"" then so be it, and if not, then that might not necessarily be a bad thing either.  For me, the most fruitful thing was to study Christian writings that were completely outside of American Protestantism and realizing that there was a vast history and living world of different traditions. Even reading the Reformers was a huge breath of fresh air.   But most importantly, have you ever tried going to different churches? This was probably the most important part for me. It took me a long time, something like 5 years after the beginnings of my rediscovery of Christianity, before I went to church again for the first time. I was confirmed as a Catholic in my teens so I had the option of receiving communion but I refrained for over a month because I didn't feel sure about it as well. Going to church again was terrifying, honestly. And the first time I went up to receive communion again my legs turned into bloody jello as I walked up to the altar. I was reminded of how Luther fainted the very first time he conducted mass. The intellectual journey back was of course terrifying and exhilarating on its own, but all of that was only just a prelude to actually returning to the church. And just as how a bad church and a bad congregation can wound people the way it has for you, myself, and so many others, a good church and a wonderful congregation can heal you and bring you a peace that is difficult to express. Although I'm glad I took my time, the whole journey probably would have been easier if I looked at different churches first. But again, I suppose everyone does work differently."

I would consider my relationship to Christianity to be constitutive of my Christian self so that seeing them as separate is meaningless. Even when I openly rejected Christianity I still had a Christian self, even if one rooted in rejection. That being said, I do not believe in a stable self anyway, and my usage of ""self"" was more for utility than exactness.  As far as going to church, because I am transgender, I am scared to go to any church that is not explicitly pro-LGBT. I think that I pass fairly well, but that does not stop the worry.  I would have to say that Derrida and Foucault have influenced me more than others so I am prone to weak theology right now, though I am still learning."

It's the people that are important. I hope the best for you - I hope that we can all help to make the churches a better place in time.  Derrida has also been quite important to me, and I will soon be writing a chapter dealing with Derrida quite heavily. If you like Derrida, it might be interesting for you to look at Augustine, if you haven't already, since there are some parallels between the two. Derrida's writings on the gift helped me a lot in my own understanding of Augustine's theology of the Trinity.

Before, in my short time before leaving the IFB, my readings were taken up by a youthful naivety that lead me to logical positivism and a worship of people like Dawkins and Hitchens, though now, ironically, I have come full anti-circle and am now critical of the hegemonic status of science, its relation to technology and biopower, and the affects that the materialization of ""nature"" has on social subjects a la Butler (1993) that is legitimized in part by science. Then I went through a Wiccan phase, brought about by my desire for the Sacred apart from the normative chains of, what I thought was, Judaeo-Christian theology, helped along by my re-evaluation of humanity's place in the ecosystem forced on me by my then-new acceptance of evolution. But whether I tried to find the Sacred within the rituals of Wicca or the experience of nature, it always eluded me, lost as it was then in the vortex of my past constantly overshadowing my present, seen not through eyes clearly but as through a glass darkly, so that I could never find anything resembling my past experience even if couched in terminology that resonated with my philosophical ideology.  This constant underwriting of present experience by past memory seems to me to be the reason for my inability to fully leave Christianity and embrace something totally other than the Christian experience since, whatever hardships and tribulations may have passed me by, my religious self has always been constituted in some way by Christ, and through this constitution I am trying to find the liberating affect that being ""one in Christ"" can achieve, though my journey now is awkward to say the least and filled with a persistent feeling of somehow betraying the secular self that I worked so hard to create after the Church, when I was lost with no-thing but my own companionship, ostracized as I was by my ""friends"" that valued doctrinal purity over compassion and love--but, again, what should one expect from the IFB?, created as they were in reaction to the modernism found in the Southern Baptist Convention and what-have-you. Anyway, my experience of the Divine and the Sacred has always been intimate yet dissonant, as though whatever God there is always seems to inhabit the limits of experience in place of the transcendent deity that the Powerful God typifies, which I why, I think, that I am drawn now to Weak theology and the idea of God as beyond constitutive limits of being yet the necessary outside to that being, never being able to be comprehended within that being, this weakness being exemplified by the Weakness shown by Christ on the cross ""as the power of the powerlessness of Jesus, in and as the protest against the injustice that rises up from the cross, in and as the words of forgiveness, not a deferred power that will be visited upon one’s enemies at a later time. God is in attendance as the weak force of the call that cries out from Calvary and calls across the epochs, that cries out from every corpse created by every cruel and unjust power. The logos of the cross is a call to renounce violence, not to conceal and defer it and then, in a stunning act that takes the enemy by surprise, to lay them low with real power, which shows the enemy who really has the power. That is just what Nietzsche was criticizing under the name of ressentiment."" (John D. Caputo, The Weakness of God: A Theology of the Event).  Christianity then, has no reason to fear postmodernism and its rejection of the Big Other of Lacan thought, rather I see the embracing of a forever unknowable God to be the only way to affect the transformation of our lives in Christ and the bringing about of the Kingdom through our own lives.

You have a way with words. We are very similar, I think. There's some crossover. Of course you're right, we are postmodern now. In postmodernism, there is no self; there is only the search for self. A fool's errand. Everybody's a fool. I probably sound like a fool. The fools were always the best characters, anyway. The light, the contrast. There's a lot to find there. There's also a lot of Jesus, or lack of Jesus, overtones. But I don't know - there are so many differences that it's impossible to speak to that as universal truth.   I guess ""universality"" gets a bit of side-eye too. The goal is to remain in a state of constant departure while always arriving, right? God knows I am. If an idea/philosophy no longer sticks, I'm not chasing it until the ends of the earth anymore, sorta just accepting that perhaps it wasn't for me after all. In these hours of my discontent I forget my motivations. I have a lot of work to do and no will. So, potential failure? Trying to find that medium between commitment and stagnation.   I'm just always under construction, though maybe I will find the holy light yet. One summer day I may hear its song again and it may alight once more..."

He is no longer simply a ridiculous and familiar silhouette in the wings: he stands center stage as the guardian of truth--playing here a role which is the complement and converse of that taken by madness in the tales and the satires. If folly leads each man into a blindness where he is lost, the madman, on the contrary, reminds each man of his truth; in a comedy where each man deceives the other and dupes himself, the madman is comedy to the second degree: the deception of deception; he utters, in his simpleton's language which makes no show of reason, the words of reason that release, in the comic, the comedy: he speaks love to lovers, the truth of life to the young, the middling reality of things to the proud, to the insolent, and to liars. Even the old feasts of fools, so popular in Flanders and northern Europe, were theatrical events, and organized into social and moral criticism, whatever they may have contained of spontaneous religious parody.

For me, poetry and prayer were especially helpful, and finding an alternative church community made a big difference. Of course you're more than welcome here, as a lot of us are in this same boat. Christianity can be an incredibly liberating way of life that allows one to explore and feel what it means to live in the light of love. Based on your post, especially the bit about wanting to overcome resentment, it seems you're already discovering that.  I don't have much how to advice other than to suggest just jumping in. Try things out. If praying makes you feel good keep doing it. If it triggers unhealthy and repressive moments then toss it out. Experiment with your Christian identity and see what sticks. Jesus came to set the captives free--we have all the freedom we need.  Edit: I also want to add that I'm sorry about what you've gone through so far.

If you're looking for resources that might help you rethink Christianity itself, like in your reference to weak theology, then a lot of us are versed in those kinds of alternative theologies (I myself have sort of ""grown up"" philosophically with Caputo in particular, for better and worse). I suppose I should reiterate one of the best things is finding a community that you feel supports you and wants to help you on that journey. Some LGBT+ churches I know of are the United Church of Christ (where my sister-in-law, who is a lesbian, attends with her family), the Episcopal Church (though some are still conservative, so make sure you talk with the priest or members first), some branches of Lutherans, and of course the Unitarians.

I am currently reading The Gospel of Christian Atheism by Altizer and The Puppet and the Dwarf by Zizek.

The gist of it is: Jesus did not perform magic to make bread and fish keep coming from the basket like so many rabbits from top hats, but instead, all of the starving people knew there were those among them who were hungrier and more in need, and so, nearly everyone there passed their chance to eat to their neighbor, until, at the end, the bread and fish had passed through thousands of hungry hands uneaten.

RadicalChristianity,3cxst9,nsoniat,5,Wed Jul 15 13:57:53 2015 UTC,I'm not convinced that the parable in Matthew 25:14-30 is about God giving money to folks. What if we thought of the 'bad' steward as Jesus?
RadicalChristianity,3cxst9,wordsmythe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:06:30 2015 UTC,"A talent is a weight of precious metals (75 lbs), in this context it is probably gold.  A talent of gold at todays price is about $1.4 million.  It is something you could reasonably bury.  What is there to indicate that Jesus is the bad steward?  Did he ever steward anything poorly?  We are called to follow Jesus and be His disciple, not mimic His life.  We are not supposed to go around asking people to follow us and to be our disciples, as an example.  Most of us are called to marry, have children, and to be the part of the body that He calls us to be.  Each part of the body will be called to do something different with their life."

Bertrand Russell once wrote that bodily death meant death of consciousness. Of course, he did not have the advantage of computers or concepts like nano-technology. Theoretically, you can actually do what the disciples described.  Also, the New Jerusalem is a cube structure that ""descends from heaven onto a new earth"". That sounds like a spaceship doesn't it?

You're basically asking, ""why aren't you fundamentalists,"" when literalist fundamentalism is a modern Protestant development that isn't shared by most of the history of Christian thought and the majority of living Christian traditions today.

I think someone else has already mentioned it, but I would probably recommend Ehrman's book, ""Did Jesus Exist?"". I think it's a nice starting point because it isn't written for an academic audience and, for politico-ideological reasons, it's helpful that Ehrman is not a Christian (he left Christianity some time ago). I think the biggest thing that trips up the entire conversation on the question of the historicity of Jesus is that people can't separate an academic evaluation of the historical existence of Jesus of Nazareth with the theological assertion of Jesus as Christ. That Jesus existed doesn't make Christian doctrine about Jesus being the Son of God true. Reactionary nu-atheism isn't able to deal with these nuances soberly. As it is often noted, the standard of ""evidence"" that people often doggedly throw around when it comes to evidence for the historicity of Jesus is based on awful historiography that, if applied consistently, would have to lead them to say that a whole slew of other historical figures are simply myths as well, particularly Socrates. This kind of methodology is what leads people to insane conspiracy-theory laden understandings of the world like phantom time hypothesis because their standard of evidence has no comprehension of what scientific methodology actually entails."

RadicalChristianity,3cyavj,TheBaconMenace,10,Sun Jul 12 03:56:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say you're sounding mean, or at least I'm not wounded, but you are sounding unnecessarily opaque and like a self-appointed judge. It's not a very anarchist spirit ;)  But here's the thing--religion is up for debate. It's only ever been up for debate. The Bible itself doesn't agree internally--there are four Gospels, let alone multiple other writers. Religion is the process of making up as you go along. Most Christians take the Bible as a guide, but not as a sole authority. You said in the other thread you grew up in the Baptist South, and it seems you still agree with them completely on what religion is. If you don't let your Baptist environment define politics for you, why the hell would you let them define religion for you? To put it bluntly: your understanding of religion is a product of an uncritical fundamentalism that you haven't actually examined.  That said, if you're looking for ""evidence"" of Jesus' historical existence (and honestly I'm not really sure why), you're not just going to be arguing with Christians, you're going to be arguing with the majority of biblical scholars, Christian and otherwise. The scholarly consensus is that Jesus existed. No one denies that, they just disagree about what exactly Jesus did and said. If you want to read some non-Christian material on this, Bart Ehrman is probably the most famous atheist writing on it, and you could also try Marcus Borg, John Crossan, Reza Aslan, and also all their footnoted authors. If you want to play the evidence game, then let's put it back on you--do you have any evidence Jesus didn't exist? No, of course not."
RadicalChristianity,3cyavj,TheBaconMenace,-3,Sun Jul 12 13:55:21 2015 UTC,"The anarchist spirit has a level of journalism in it. I question religion the same way I question the state, and capitalism.    do you have any evidence Jesus didn't exist? No, of course not.   that is not how it works. You are claiming he existed, I am asking for proof, and you have nothing. But, let me humor you a little: http://www.vexen.co.uk/religion/christianity_nojesus.html  The only thing I asked for in this post was truth, and I got nothing. How are you all still christian"

RadicalChristianity,3cyavj,ratherephemeral,8,Sun Jul 12 18:31:36 2015 UTC,"Given that your source isn't exactly a peer-reviewed or scholarly one, I'm admittedly hesitant to spend the time going through it. From a cursory google search, the author, Vexen Crabtree, doesn't appear to have any credentials (I, too, have a journalistic spirit :) ).  The authors I mentioned have book-length interactions with these issues, so I would encourage you to check out your local library. Ehrman summarizes a response here, but it's not exactly earth-shattering stuff (and I want to emphasize again that Ehrman is an atheist biblical scholar).  I don't have evidence that Jesus was God because I don't think that makes a difference. I guess I'd say if there is a God, then Jesus is probably the best picture of what it would mean for a human to be most like God (taking 1 John's words that 'God is Love' at their face value), but I don't care about proving that or not.  As for being an adult, admittedly my own responses are, to be frank, far more childish than most of my friends around here, who are trying to encourage a broader and more mature vision of what truth, evidence, and Christianity are. I'd honestly encourage you to revisit them with a more open mind (like a good journalist :) )."
RadicalChristianity,3cyavj,ratherephemeral,-7,Sun Jul 12 19:01:32 2015 UTC,"See, the problem is you keep asking for historians, an d every time I post one, the christian response is to say that he or she isn't good enough historian. You're post is a blog, and a summarized opinion. There is absolutely no evidence in it.   what I'm asking for is evidence that jesus existed, so could you please provide me with evidence that he did, and not just opinions? You say that my historians aren't good enough, and then you link me to a blog? Are you serious? That's what everyone else here has been doing.    I don't have evidence that Jesus was God because I don't think that makes a difference.   well, it makes a difference, in whether or not it is true. Why do you believe that jesus is a god?   My only question is ""what makes this belief true"". That is really the most important question anyone could ask about anything, and when it comes to religion (they all react the same way, this way), I just get jerked around.

Surely you're not going to maintain that ""Vexen Crabtree"" is on equal scholarly footing as Bart Ehrman. Again, feel free to check out these books (Ehrman's Did Jesus Exist, Crossan's The Historical Jesus, etc.) and then tell me there's no evidence for Jesus' existence.  I mean you literally just linked me to a guy's random internet web page, and now you're complaining that I sent you a piece published in the Huffington Post by a recognized, atheist, biblical historian.

There is only one kind of truth; either it is true, or it isn't. With religion, people make up their own truths all the time, because, as you pointed out, if they were to hold their views to a normal standard of truth, religion would not have  single leg to stand on.

Again, you don't have a right to be spoonfed, and to make it clear: your approach is to constantly demand to be fed with a very particular type of spoon.   No. I am just asking for the same, plain old truth that every single other historical claim has in order to make it true.

I'm not quite sure what you mean by this... the concept of hell doesn't bother me because it is just another made up segment of a made up religion. My point about it was that christians believe that heaven is for christians, and hell is for non-christians. That being said, why wouldn't you jump at the chance to prove your religion to me and save me from hell?  Relax a litte bit. I don't hate people with religion, it's just... fake.   EDIT: I keep using the word 'truth', because I'm open minded, really what I mean is piece of evidence. I have found using the word evidence is intimidating when talking about religion, so I use truth, as a way of saying ""anything that makes it true"" For example, To prove that Napoleon Bonaparte was real, we have his skeleton, paintings from that era, documentation of his existence, documentation of the battles he fought, and artifacts recovered by historians. That makes his existence real. What makes christianity true?"
RadicalChristianity,3cyavj,Demon_Nietzsche,16,Sun Jul 12 00:09:34 2015 UTC,"Your question as you keep asking it is way too vague to even begin to answer. Christianity and religions in general are not propositions. It is not something that can be true or false, correct or incorrect. If you have a specific question about christianity or a truth claim you associate with christianity, it's much more likely somebody will be able give you an answer you are satisfied with."
RadicalChristianity,3cyavj,yibanghwa,-9,Sat Jul 11 23:28:27 2015 UTC,"It's not ""to vague to answer"", it's totally open ended, and allows for any kind of answer. The only question I'm asking is what makes christianity true (factual, real, the right religion), as oposed to the other ones. No one has been bale to do that. Doesn't that at least raise an eyebrow?"
RadicalChristianity,3cyavj,Demon_Nietzsche,8,Sun Jul 12 00:24:42 2015 UTC,Christianity is a huge subject and people are not going to guess for you what your question is. You need to take a minute and formulate a specific question if you ever want an answer. Do you want to know if we believe in a specific doctrine? Do you want to know what our reasons are for taking a particular attitude or methodology? Are you curious about existing historical scholarship about a specific event or person? What do you want to know?
RadicalChristianity,3cyavj,ratherephemeral,-9,Sun Jul 12 00:34:58 2015 UTC,"Ok, that makes sense... the thing is CHRISTianity is based on the bible. SOLEY on the bible. In fact, the bible is the only thing that CHRISTianity comes from. People who are CHRISTians believe that the things written in the bible are true, and the jesus is the lord and savior to our planet.   My question is how do you know any of that for a fact? I mean really, if you can take ANY part Christianity that you can prove to be true, I'll take it. I'm not trying to be vague, I'm trying to leave enough room for ANY kind of evidence that I am unaware of."
RadicalChristianity,3cyavj,Demon_Nietzsche,9,Sun Jul 12 00:42:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I can actually speak to the truth of some of your assertions....   CHRISTianity is based on the bible. SOLEY on the bible. In fact, the bible is the only thing that CHRISTianity comes from.    That is not true on several levels. Christianity didn't become what it is today (for better or worse)  by starting over with the Bible every generation. It is also based on traditions including lots of commentary, councils, folklore, etc.  Christianity also did not originate from the Bible. While Jesus was a Jew, many early Christians were not, and were therefore not familiar with the Torah. None of what is now known as the New Testament was written while Jesus was alive. After Jesus died, Paul became a significant teacher among some of the early movement. Many Christians today consider his extant letters to be holy scripture... but nobody did at the time. The current new testament canon -- the books which most christians agree should be included in the bible -- evolved over time and was different in different geographic locations. It was several hundred years after Jesus died until most christians agreed on the major works which appear in the New Testament used by almost all christians today.  So it is much more accurate to say that the New Testament is based on Christianity, not the other way around.   People who are CHRISTians believe that the things written in the bible are true   As a christian who is also literate, I examine the things that are written in the Bible and decide for myself if they are true (and in what ways they are true) and how they can be useful to me.   jesus is the lord and savior to our planet.   Jesus was an itinerant, cynical, Jewish, peasant teacher who lived (briefly) during a time of brutal Roman rule and who said some rather insightful (if cryptic) things which might, indeed, in my opinion, save our planet.  Whether Jesus was actually a person is lost to history. I personally find many of his sayings to be of such consistent and quirky quality that it is easy for me to believe that there was a single, actual Jesus of Nazareth. The historical quality of the gospel narrations and the early date of a movement based around his teachings are also evidence supporting his existence.  But there is lots of scholarship out there on the historicity of Jesus and the creation of the Bible that I'm not very familiar with but which you can look into for yourself. I personally really like the Jesus Seminar and there main work, The Five Gospels, which sets out to try to determine which sayings in the gospel can really be attributed to the historic Jesus. I highly recommend it if you find this topic interesting."
RadicalChristianity,3cyavj,wordsmythe,-10,Sun Jul 12 01:19:17 2015 UTC,"Christianity also did not originate from the Bible   Yes, it did. If it didn't, then that means that jesus was a real person. Do you have any evidence that jesus was a real person?   As a christian who is also literate, I examine the things that are written in the Bible and decide for myself if they are true (and in what ways they are true) and how they can be useful to me.   Then you are admitting that the bible is not a good source of information. You don't decide if something is true or not, because truth is not an opinion.    Whether Jesus was actually a person is lost to history.   Then why do you believe he existed? What facts lead you to the conclusion that he existed?   But there is lots of scholarship out there on the historicity of Jesus and the creation of the Bible that I'm not very familiar with but which you can look into for yourself.   So, there are people out there who are studying the historical truthfullness of the bible, and, your not interested? What do you say to all the historians that say that jesus never existed? (they aren't CLAIMING he never existed, there is just no evidence that he did)  Another response, more mental gymnastics, more stories and links... no truth.

RadicalChristianity,3cyavj,frychu,9,Sun Jul 12 21:39:23 2015 UTC,To summarize what others have posted here:   You have a very narrow view of Christianity. This is consensus. You have a very narrow view of truth. The truth isn't binary (the principle of non-contradiction is wrong!). Math and Philosophy acknowledge this. We can talk about five values of truth: 1. true and only true; 2. false and only false; 3. both; 4. neither; 5. ineffable.
RadicalChristianity,3cyavj,frychu,13,Sun Jul 12 13:28:03 2015 UTC,"I think that one problem with a question like ""what makes christianity true?"" is that it assumes a certain understanding of Christianity – i.e. that it can be empirically verifiable. You can't give evidence that Christianity is ""true"" using inductive or deductive reasoning. You can maybe give evidence for the existence of deism (most strongly through the cosmological argument, but also through the teleological and ontological arguments), but that sort of argument does not do anything in order to prove the existence of God.   Part of the problem with a debate over the existence of God is that those who wrote the bible weren't very concerned with questions like ""does God exist?"", rather they were concerned with questions like ""why this God?"". Thus, the bible doesn't make any attempts to prove the existence of God because it would be assumed that God exists (and all the other gods of different religions as well). The really ""radical"" Christian claim was that you should abandon your other gods and embrace this one.   The people here, as far as I know, aren't interested in bringing others to faith. I am not interested in apologetics. I tried to answer you in the thread that ""truth"", in a logical positivist sense, doesn't matter, to me, when it comes to religion. That was the point of the quote I gave from Brian Massumi. To make an analogy. I cannot prove to you that love exists. I cannot prove to you that I love my partner. What I can do is tell you about how my love for my partner makes me feel. I can tell you about how my love for my partner informs the way that I act in the world. It's the same thing for religion. I cannot prove that God exists, I cannot prove that religion is truth, but I can tell you about how my religion informs my world.   If someone was able to show that Christianity was true, it would cease to be a religion."

RadicalChristianity,3cyavj,TheBaconMenace,-8,Wed Jul 15 14:16:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!    I think that one problem with a question like ""what makes christianity true?"" is that it assumes a certain understanding of Christianity – i.e. that it can be empirically verifiable   Christianity is making a historical claim. 2000 years ago, God sent his son to die for our sins, so that he wouldn't torture a small percentage of us afterwards. This is the claim of christianity. If truth is not compatible with your religion, then your religion is fake.    Part of the problem with a debate over the existence of God is that those who wrote the bible weren't very concerned with questions like ""does God exist?""   So they skipped an entire step of logic.    The really ""radical"" Christian claim was that you should abandon your other gods and embrace this one.   What makes other gods fake, and yours real?   I cannot prove to you that love exists   love absolutly exists, because it can be witnessed, and felt. SO HANG ON THEN! Your next claim would be ""right, and I can FEEL my god! therefore he exists!"" Every single other person in every single other religion would say the same thing, and it would be just as true as the god that you feel on the inside.    If someone was able to show that Christianity was true, it would cease to be a religion.   how can a thinking person be a christian while they are able to admit to that?"
RadicalChristianity,3cyavj,RPangerandacceptance,12,Sat Jul 11 23:48:58 2015 UTC,"You keep making claims about what I believe, based on your understanding of Christianity. You want me to give you proof for beliefs that I don't hold. I'm not sure how I can do that.    love absolutly exists, because it can be witnessed, and felt.   You cannot empirically give evidence that love exists. I'd like to see your evidence for the existence of love.    So they skipped an entire step of logic.   No they were interested in different questions. This has nothing to do with inductive reasoning. To claim ""Our God is better than your God for reason XYZ"" is a completely different argument than ""Our God is real, your god is not"". The scripture is not concerned with the latter.    What makes other gods fake, and yours real?   See above.    how can a thinking person be a christian while they are able to admit to that?   You should go talk to this guy who I have personally heard say (i'm paraphrasing) ""You cannot make an argument for 'the faith', if you could it wouldn't be a faith. You can make arguments for God, but not for faith.""  If your interested in arguing about the existence of God (rather than Christianity), I'd be more than happy to oblige you.   Edit: and yes, my appeal to Plantinga could be understood as an appeal to authority. But I'd consider him a ""thinking person"" if there was such a thing."

No they were interested in different questions.   They skipped a step. It's just like when you see a buzzfeed article, ""WHY DO MATTRESSES KILL?"" Your first question should be ""Wait, hang on- DO mattresses kill?"" That would be logical.   So, you don't have any evidence, proof, truth, or facts that make your religion real? then why are you a christian?

A book I read solely on /u/TheBaconMenace 's recommendation.    A Greek or a Portuguese or an Italian exit from the eurozone would soon lead to a fragmentation of European capitalism, yielding a seriously recessionary surplus region east of the Rhine and north of the Alps, while the rest of Europe would be in the grip of vicious stagflation. Who do you think would benefit from this development? A progressive left, that will rise Phoenix-like from the ashes of Europe’s public institutions? Or the Golden Dawn Nazis, the assorted neofascists, the xenophobes and the spivs? I have absolutely no doubt as to which of the two will do best from a disintegration of the eurozone. I, for one, am not prepared to blow fresh wind into the sails of this postmodern version of the 1930s. If this means that it is we, the suitably erratic Marxists, who must try to save European capitalism from itself, so be it. Not out of love for European capitalism, for the eurozone, for Brussels, or for the European Central Bank, but just because we want to minimise the unnecessary human toll from this crisis.   If you must step on the Marxist Fumie to save the lives of countless others, so be it. I suspect much sharper minds than mine can make a great case for why this is not only wrong but always wrong. I will grant you this in advance.   But it is to the spirit of this heresy with which I relate and joyfully cry out in hope that it does invigorate the 'not really ready' and fragmented Left.

I would say that the EU is an imperialist conglomeration of capitalists and that it breaking up may actually be beneficial in the long run to anti-imperialist struggles abroad.   My major fear is not the 1930's but rather the 1970's (á la Soviet Social Imperialism) with the reassumption of historical Russian imperialist relationships after an EU collapse. Even this is not enough for me to back European Capital to ""save it from itself"".   Instead of taking either a Eurocommunist or a Euraseocommunist standpoint, we should take a solidly anti-imperialist stance and learn from the mistakes of the 1930's, and understand the nature of imperialism.

RadicalChristianity,3bzvni,IReallyTriedISuppose,16,Fri Jul 3 14:31:13 2015 UTC,"I was linked here from another sub. What is ""radical christian theology""? If you simply mean really unorthodox then of course there are Muslims with unorthodox positions.  There are ""quranists"". They believe that the entire hadith corpus is fabrication/guess work and unreliable. The Qur'an is thus the only Islamic scripture. This is viewed as heretical and also necessitates several core tenets of Islam be abandoned. Many core aspects such as the five pillars, the specifics on how to pray, and such are in the hadith not the Qur'an. Some Quranists reject them (rejection of five pillars and the six article of faith is basically tantamount to unbelief). Others do believe in the five pillars and six articles of faith because they consider it a part of ""the living tradition"". In my view this is just mental gymnastics but of course I am biased.  There are of course Muslims who identify as anarchists. This is a bit difficult in my opinion since Muhammad (ﷺ) created a state and functioned as it's head.  There are of course Muslims with Marxist and Socialist leanings. You can make a very good case that Islam has many socialist elements. Zakat is an obligatory core tenet of Islam and it is a tax on capital to redistribute wealth to the poor. Charging interest on loans is completely forbidden. Many improvements to the rights of workers and the poor. Public property. The Islamic state is considered by many to be the world's first welfare state with the introduction of Bayt al-mal. However Islam is also perfectly OK with setting up business, acquiring wealth and capital through legitimate means and private property. Indeed Islam considers the the right to hold property a right. So it's a bit hard to reconcile with Marx's vision of communism.  There were the Mu`tazila. A school of thought with theological views many today would consider radical (e.g. They say the Qur'an is not co-eternal with God and is a created thing). They went extinct ages ago, but I heard that neo-Mu`tazila exist today. This of course would be pretty radical.  ISIS and other takfiri groups hold very radical and unorthodox views to justify their transgressions.  I am an Ahmadi Muslim, a group considered my most other Muslims to be non-muslim due to alleged heresy. The reasons for this view is as follows:   We believe in a lesser prophet after Muhammad (ﷺ) who claimed to be the Imam Mahdi and second coming of Jesusas. We believe Jesusas was crucified but survived crucifixion, lived the rest of his life on earth and died a natural death. Mainstream Islamic view as that he ascended to heaven in the flesh before crucifixion, someone else was crucified in his place (who was made by god to look like Jesusas, thus they thought Jesusas was killed). Then Jesusas will then return in the later days literally from the sky in the flesh.   Other then these and a few minor differences, we are very very similar to Hanafi Sunnis. Some Ahmadi Muslim redditors run a sub called /r/ahmadiyyat.  EDIT:Also look at my second post below regarding universalism."

RadicalChristianity,3bzvni,Dragon9770,3,Fri Jul 3 19:52:01 2015 UTC,"When you say ""Islam considers the right to hold property a right,"" what is the source of that. As far as I know, rights-based political thinking is a very Anglo-based concept. I also assume that is something else Quranists would deny, or at least not be dependent on.   Islam talks a lot about rights. Rights of God (it is his right to be worshipped), rights of orphans, rights of prisoners, rights of rulers, rights of the ruled, rights of wife over husband, rights of husband over wife.  With regards to property, the Qur'an has clearly made halal (lawful) trade and business.   O you who have believed, do not consume one another's wealth unjustly but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent. And do not kill yourselves [or one another]. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful.   In the verses forbidden interest, it is clear people are entitled to their property.   Allah will destroy Riba (usury) and will give increase for Sadaqat (deeds of charity, alms, etc.) And Allah likes not the disbelievers, sinners. Truly those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), and give Zakat, they will have their reward with their Lord. On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Riba (usury) (from now onward), if you are (really) believers. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums).   Emphasis mine. This is not even getting in to hadith. The Qur'an talks about property, zakat and charity. These verses would be meaningless if owning property was not allowed.   I just took a university class on Quranic study, so I probably understand them better traditional hadity+Quran Muslims. My impression is that simply being a Quranists, as well as a contextual reader of the Medinian suras (i.e. all the sexist, legalistic, and inheritance related stuff can be ascribed to being merely war-time measures for the fight with the Quraysh; ex. in a situation where many men are dying in battle, with a whole bunch of widows and orphans and a tribalistic culture Muhammad is having to compromise with, it make sense to ascribe several women to the protection of a single man.)    What do you find sexist? Woman can have equal or more inheritance then equally related male relatives depending on who's alive at the time of death, other times they have less. What is sexist about consensual polygamy (although Islam allows polygamy with conditions, not encouraging it)?  Islam is a very legalistic religion by nature.   as a contextual reader   This is one of my main problems with Quranists. You can't be a contextual reader of the Qur'an and quranist because the main source of context is the hadith.   I have a hard time following your use of superscripted Jesus. Is it that Jesus hid in the desert for 800 years, and then popped up and was like ""hey, its me, Jesus/Mahdi, guess what..."" Or is it more like ""Hi, I am Mahdi, and it turns out I am a reincarnation of Jesus""? I know the mainstream Jesus replacement story, but not the Ahmadi version   No no. As I said our belief is that Jesusas died on earth. Our founder who claimed Mahdi did not claim reincarnation of Jesusas, but coming in the likeness of him. Similar to how Yahyaas (John the Baptist) was the second coming of Elijah according to Jesusas."
RadicalChristianity,3bzvni,n3wu53r,2,Fri Jul 3 20:14:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry I misinterpreted your part about Jesus; I just had a hard time understanding and I am afraid I might have come across as crass.  When I meant the part about rights, I meant not the idea of justice being done to people based on their condition and through the language of divine law (rendering unto women and orphans protection, unto the poor alms, unto the people of the Book tolerance, etc.).  That is all ""legalistic"" language that you could find in any pre-modern society globally with anything resembling feudalism.  What I meant was any language like ""There is some transcendent connection between one's membership in a large universal group (living things, humanity, Ahl al-Kitab, Muslims) and some act, state of being, or object.""  The most influential of these as a legal-philosophical concepts is the Rights of Englishmen and the subsequent development of (Christian) Natural Law and Just War Theory, John Lockean Liberalism, etc.  The Law is merely meant to recognize/contain the extent of  these pre-existing ""rights,"" not establish them.  I was wondering if the Quran or maybe hadith contained that kind of message in non-legalistic language.  In my class, the main avenue in which we explored the sexism theme was the exegetical debate/issue of ayah 4:34 (the things like how translation of the terms involved  can vary the intensity/severity of the implication, etc.; heck, there is apparent some Islamic scholar who wrote a whole book on the exegetical history of just that one line).  I am well aware of the vast improvement Islam was on the preceding Arabian society; I never forget the part from one of the last suras condemning the burying of live females babies.  I was just noting that 4:34 was from the Medinian period.  Finally, for the contextualist POV, the only claim I was making was to the historical aspect of the war and stuff, not necessarily the circumstances of revelation (or however that phrase went) that the hadith are usually used for.  Well-trusted hadith can be used as historical material to get a picture of Arabian and early Islamic society, so as to get a general cultural context, without necessarily marrying oneself to the specific circumstance of a Quranic revelation."

Natural universal laws vs government recognition) not whether Islam considers something to be a right or not.

If what you mean by that is that eventually all will be saved (i.e. hell is not infinite punishment for all) then here is the Islamic position.  Orthodox Sunnis hold that non-Muslims can enter heaven depending on circumstance. However if a non-Muslim after the advent of Islam enters hell they are in hell forever. If a Muslim goes to hell, it is for a finite period until God takes them out.  Ahmadis like me have the view that the above taking out of Hell is not for Muslims only, that God can take out anyone and that hell is not infinite punishment for all non-muslims in it. This view isn't new nor was it first proposed by Ahmadis. It is believed Ibn Taymiyyah may have held this view based on his book Fanaah an-Naar however many state he never believed it. His student Ibn al-Qayyim certainly held it for most of his life (and argued for them in the books Haadi al-Arwaah and Shifaa al-‘Aleel) but later changed his view."

The fact that I actually believe this person is the incarnation of God is secondary to who I believe this person was if that makes sense.

RadicalChristianity,3b7bg6,Demon_Nietzsche,4,Mon Jun 29 15:51:36 2015 UTC,"Marriage in itself is oppressive. It presupposes a normative ideal that is based in hetero-normative mythos. This mythos assumes that a male/female pairing is normatively good and natural. Not only does the institution, in and of itself, oppress people who do not fit into that framework (i.e. cis, straight people), but it also oppresses those who are not married, or have no desire to become married. What happens to people who are asexual, or polygamous, or who live sexual lives that deviate from this norm. They exist outside of this norm - they are Othered and Erased. By deviating from this norm, they become classified as deviants, and deserve anything bad that happens to them.  An example can be seen in how we treat prostitutes. Prostitutes do not fit into this normative framework, and as a result are systematically oppressed. They deserve the bad things that happen to them because they deviate from the norm. So too, people with sexually transmitted infections deserve their infections because they deviated the norm. The narrative goes that if they had followed the normative frame they would be fine. Or single mothers, who also are pushed away from abortions, are punished systemically for having a child - and many claim that they deserve this punishment (because liberalism loves desert).   TL;DR: Marriage equality does not create a more egalitarian world – as liberals would have you believe – instead, marriage equality functions to expand a hetero-narrative framework which is by its nature oppressive."

RadicalChristianity,3ayos8,TheBaconMenace,5,Wed Jun 24 16:12:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing some creative thoughts! For what it's worth, here are some of my questions/thoughts/reactions:   Inverted Theosis: human became God so that she can become human. That is, we must not look for God in the midst of suffering, we must be there helping those who suffer.   I'm not sure it's inverted as much as it is one-sided. Theosis is the humanization of God and the deification of humanity; you appear to want the former without the latter. Also, does looking for God in the midst of suffering preclude being there to help those who suffer? Aren't those things sometimes very closely related, both for the person helping and for the person who is in fact suffering?   We may not find God, but we find the Other. By that, we can do good without waiting for a reward.   I'm not totally clear on how the italics necessitate the second sentence. Does finding God mean one necessarily has to wait for a reward? Does not finding God but finding ""the Other"" mean one isn't waiting for a reward? Those don't seem so obvious to me.   Seems to me that mysticism and atheism are very close: only a mystic can be an atheist and only an atheist can be a mystic.   I'd agree they're close insofar as mysticism is the blurring and often erasure of boundaries like theism and atheism. I wouldn't agree that one needs to be one to be the other."
RadicalChristianity,3ayos8,TheBaconMenace,2,Wed Jun 24 17:42:19 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. Thanks for the help.  Mystics were a great influence for Radical Theology, like Meister Eckhart's prayer.  We need more mysticism in our life, to doubt more, and live well with the unknown. We are, as a society and as a church, too much certain.  How we can engage mysticism in our life? How to develop a mystical practice and thought for our century?"
RadicalChristianity,3ayos8,synthresurrection,3,Thu Jun 25 23:23:57 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I wonder if this is contextual. For me, I feel like I'm in a context surrounded by doubt, not just doubt about religion or whatever but doubt in general, which produces a distrust of any actual change or positive, creative movement. In short, cynicism. I think doubt is super important insofar as a critical distance from things and opportunities for self-examination are crucial, but doubt is a cannibalizing foundation that ends in despair (to invoke an early work by Kierkegaard translated as ""Everything Must Be Doubted!"").   As I understand it, it's not that the church that does too much doubting (the problem being that it keeps these doubts in the closet), and less that society does too much doubting (which is why we have a free market--to fill in the evacuated space created by a failure to actually commit to anything), but that neither are willing to have faith in anything.  But then again, I'm not a Radical Theology guy, and I understand why doubt really appeals to and liberates people in certain situations. I suppose I want to be more confessional here, just expressing my own feelings, rather than to suggest you're wrong or something. I think what you're exploring is really great."

Not a short resource unfortunately, but it's not a super tough read either. Also not all theories of the Event are the same, but the basic point is that events are things you can't anticipate philosophically but can recognize. For Caputo it means having a theology that is open to change and recognizing when events occur that can't be simply doctrinally explained away."

RadicalChristianity,3a8lms,Mashburned,5,Thu Jun 18 02:16:03 2015 UTC,"Hi. I'm living in an intentional Christian community in New Zealand. About a generation ago, (some) members of our Church had a look at the call of Christ at face value and realized that the middle class lifestyle of attending church once a week and maybe spending a little on charity now and then didn't really compare with what we as Christians are actually called to do by Jesus. We are called to Martyrdom, and while that may not necessarily mean literal death, it does mean giving up your life to Christ's mission. Our founders were in many ways influenced by the philosophies of Boenhoffer and Nouwen. Our community was established in order to facilitate a missionary effort in a local neighbourhood that has a large amount of poverty (both financial and other kinds).  Our neighbourhood community structure is centred around several houses/flats that operate semi-autonomously and have different missional focuses. For example, the local school, foster care, prisoner reintegration etc. A big emphasis in on geographic location, we intend to live among those in need as Jesus did and journey with them.  The reason I joined (not necessarily unique to me) was that I was struck by the simplicity of it. We are called to a mission, we should just fucking do it ae? I am grateful though that the community was there to provide a support network for me: real, meaningful mission requires partnership with eachother as well as God.  My reservations before joining mainly concerned wanting to back out at a later point or getting 'trapped' here. Those fears have proven unfounded for two reasons -  Firstly, what I've found is soul food, there is something beautiful about seeing God at work in the lives of those around me. It is hard to pin down exactly what I'm trying to say, but I know that going back to the softly selfish lifestyle I had before would feel spiritually hollow. I can't go back. Secondly, there is no trap, I can leave whenever I want and in fact many people do drift in and out of different levels of commitment to our community depending on their season in life. I know that if I get the itch to leave the door is always open. It's reassuring but not in the least bit tempting.  One thing I didn't expect was how hard it would be. The call of Christ is hard, and I encountered many 'flaws' in myself which I have had to overcome in order to serve effectively. Pride is a big one, I have realised how proud I am and how that can affect the way I relate to others. I have also learned to deal with failure, the biggest expectation of mine to be shattered was the classic 'white knight syndrome' which may be common to mission-minded people.  I hope that answers your question. I went through my /r/atheism phase in my teen years, I've still got Dawkins and Dennet on my shelf. The thing that brought me back to God wasn't hearing about his Word in a church or on the web, it was seeing it lived. I don't know if this is the answer you were looking for, but it was mine."
RadicalChristianity,3a8lms,cantykea,4,Thu Jun 18 11:36:44 2015 UTC,"Beautiful!  I want to pay for a billboard somewhere that says ""We are called to a mission, we should just fucking do it ae?""  Thanks so much for the response.  Do individuals in the community have regular sources of income?  If its from regular employment, does that mean that people commute (I assume there are few stable jobs in the immediate vicinity)?  How do decisions about community resources (time, money, space) get made?  How do those in surrounding neighborhoods view the community?  Has there ever been an issue crop up that caused friction?"
RadicalChristianity,3a8lms,cantykea,2,Thu Jun 18 12:11:22 2015 UTC,"The city I live in is interesting, there are a few stark social precipices and so the neighbourhood in which the community is based is only a 10-15 minute drive from some fairly affluent areas. Most (if not all) members of the community work in neighbouring suburbs, although the community owns a non-profit business that employs a few of our people. Decisions about resources are made by a leadership team with the assent of our 'core' members. These core members are all of those actually living in the community. With regards to friction-causing issues, these can and do pop up from time to time. Often they are centred around the question of how to use our resources or to run certain programs. I see now that this is natural though. Before I joined community I think I had quite a rose tinted view of how everyone was on the same page. That illusion gets shattered pretty quick. I have learned that what defines a strong community is how it deals with these issues, not whether or not they will crop up.  It is a recognised phenomenon in our community that new members will initially see everyone as 'angelic', after a process of disillusionment they will view everyone as 'demonic' before it finally dawns on them that everyone is actually just human.  Interestingly, the strongest opposition our community has faced has been from within the Baptist Union of Churches in New Zealand."

RadicalChristianity,3a8mev,gilles_trilleuze,3,Thu Jun 18 02:22:25 2015 UTC,"Just a quick comment on the opening line.  It denotes a double motion. Inner movement (schizophrenia) and outer movement (walking) when placed together gives a third motion.  But there is in fact a 4th motion or ""difference"". Because schizophrenics often have ""leaky"" sensoriums such that they tend to hear voices or bond with material objects in some intimate or personal way, there is a Cartesian transgression here where the subject/Object strict dichotomy is blurred and porous so schizophrenia becomes both an extremely intimate, unshareable intensity as well as a burgeoning yet impossible extension- a metaphor of this Cartesian heresy is animism, the proud father of commodity fetishism. Animism was more than once proferred as pragmatic by Deleuze.   I found this fascinating when I realized it. The sentence being a fractal of Deleuzian thought. Of course all of this is axiomatic to Deleuzian thought and self-referential, nonetheless that all this could be in that sentence is amazing.  A neurotic on a couch would be a near antithesis of the opening line.  A neurotic/psychotic in analysis is similar to a ""triple bind"" where the neurotic is ""stuck"" in life, immobilized on a couch and dependent/waiting on the analyst. But the Opening lines are very much representative of Deleuze's immanent empiricist mathesis.  Also time is present here as well. The schizophrenic is in the ""now"" often tragically so (ordeal) while the neurotic is stuck in the past or future."
RadicalChristianity,3a8mev,zummi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:01:14 2015 UTC,That's a great observation that I've missed.    can you explain this a bit more?    the Opening lines are very much representative of Deleuze's immanent empiricist mathesis.
RadicalChristianity,3a8mev,zummi,2,Thu Jun 18 13:43:05 2015 UTC,"Deleuze, along with Derrida, was in my limited survey Western medical philosophy, The biggest proponent of the idea that our language is completely infested with fascistic ideology, dogma and political control. Deleuze believe it or not close however quite a bit more pragmatic than Derrida in my opinion because he posits practice away world that is solutionary and soteriological. Unfortunately Deleuze requested that some of his earlier works be completely excluded from his bibliography even post humorously. Nonetheless he wrote an introduction for Malfettis mathesis. In this introduction all of his philosophy is already present but less cryptically so. But deleuze wants to raise aesthetics and that kind of sublime and Numinous aesthetic experience to a kind of agency beyond or above or outside of or in lieu of language. Deleuze bemoans the pre-historic seperation of metaphysics and science and sees in Malfetti but more broadly in the gist of ""mathesis"" in general, a way or perhaps the way to recombine thought and action, language an agency Etc.  Rameys chapter on Bruno in hermetic deleuze may help.  By the way I have found the collapse volume III ""the unknown deleuze"" a very good grounding in his thought after reading several books already."

RadicalChristianity,3a8mev,zummi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:26:15 2015 UTC,"Also, Deleuze wanted to in many ways though not all, to invert Platonism. His application of bergsonian time as a kind of collective, timeless memory from which everything comes forth so that memory though transmorgrific and faulty was still a primary kind of meta-agency. This makes his views of time (Aion and Cronos) inveterate also. Many of his concepts are indeed inversions of modern conceptualizations of timeless philosophical concepts. I view many of his ideas as attempts to Idealize chaos, to embody destructive and chaotic movements that are constantly tearing things down, an opposition towards platonic form."

RadicalChristianity,39pv26,revparadox,7,Sun Jun 14 20:28:59 2015 UTC,"This kind of stock-taking is helpful insofar as it almost always reveals that our community can't really adopt a ""program,"" or even really a unifying theme. As an organic assemblage of interests, research, journeys, etc., it's a shifting space of drop-ins and drop-outs. Some practices here have helped to establish at least a semblance of structure or some scaffolding; for example, the (if I may be so bold as to put it this way) policing strategies of the community as a whole--against the oppressive discourses listed on the sidebar, but even against ""progressive evangelicalism""--have really shaped things, probably even more than posting links or topics of discussion. The same could be said for group AMAs, to take a more positive example. But in either case, it shows, I think, that this community operates under particular tendencies that continue to evolve, rather than according to a certain line or following the lure of a specific vision.   It's hard to say exactly how or why things are this way, but it seems like it's the result primarily and simply of which users are more or less active.

Those are the folks doing the policing and the creating, and so it shouldn't be a surprise that our sub is very congenial to that movement. At least, to speak for myself, while I'm not a DoG subscriber I really appreciate those here who are, especially for their willingness to keep thinking together and throwing things up to bounce off of. At other times in the history of the sub, say when /u/blazingtruth was really active, the sub was just as much interested in discourses surrounding mysticism, existentialism, etc. as it was in DoG theology.  For me, then, I think the most promising move for the sub at this point is to refuse to cast a vision (a task that was revealed to be basically impossible, imo, following the privacy experiment). The scaffolding that's here now will likely stay (that is, against certain theological/political families), so it's more a matter of finding out how to improvise and create in that framework. The uniqueness of this sub among other ""Christian"" subs is that it tries to be a creative space. We actively refuse simple blogspamming, arbitrary self-promotion, apologetics, etc., exactly for this purpose. To that end, I'd say if the sub should ""go"" anywhere, it should be in the direction that keeps its creative energies and vitality going in such a way that it allows for the experimentation of/with Christianity.  In terms of certain specific things that could be done, I think the mix tape threads, reading threads, AMA threads, and the like are especially helpful here. Our creative energies have always flourished when we have taken the time to get to know and interact with each other, and they have always receded when we stopped those kinds of engagements."

RadicalChristianity,39pv26,revparadox,11,Thu Jun 18 21:16:00 2015 UTC,"I think radical Christianity is the expounding of a radical Christianity. I feel that radical Christianity encompasses multiple aspects that range from radical/Tolstoyan pacifism to armed rebellion, and encompasses post-theistic strands of theology. I feel that the sub is torn between it's political side and it's theological side and I don't know how to mediate the two. I like both sides of the conversation but I don't know how to make it a thing where both are prominent, rather than one or the other. What are your thoughts /u/Demon_Nietzsche?"
RadicalChristianity,39pv26,GopherState,10,Fri Jun 19 23:49:47 2015 UTC,"I believe that part of what makes this sub great (or problematic, depending of where you are coming from) is that it involves so many different lines of thought coming together. I think that radical Christianity can encompass a number of things.    Radical can be understood as ""going to the root, or fundamental"". Here I see a lot of people who are interested in fully living a life of Christ. You get your Shane Claiborne type people here, but you also get your radical orthodoxy and truechristian type folks who believe that this is the place for them.  Radical can be understood as radical theology. Here you get your Death of God people, with Peter Rollins and Jack Caputo lovers. In addition, you get people who have theologies that wouldn't necessarily fall into radical theology, but do fit with the more extreme understanding of radical. You might get some open theists, or theopoetics, etc. Radical can be understood as favoring drastic political, economic or social reforms. Here you get, I think, the majority of the people positing in this sub reddit. The problem (or good thing) is that there are a great number of groups this encompassed. You have 1. Communistist; 2. Anarchists; 3. Socialists; 4. Pacifists; 5. Etc.,  Out of three you also gain our nature and engagement with social issues (such as gender, for example). This can, at times, bash against some of the people from section one, who understanding of radical as something like radical orthodoxy.    Now, I'm in favor of some of these discussions over others. I'm interested in different aspects in each of these groups (though I'm not super interested in group #1)  In terms of having a prominent discourse, I'd love to have discourse on different texts, but I'm not sure that is what the community needs. I think that everyone here should have a say in what occurs in the sub (within reason of course, we're not going to let this place turn into a bigoted cesspool), which is more or less the purpose of this thread. I want to engage with the concerns of the people who are here.   Edit: I don't think I've answered your question, which is more, or less, because I don't have an answer to it."

That said, I think the discussions of both theology and politics are what allow us to weigh in on social issues in a holistic way. In other words, it is in focusing on social issues that both radical theology and radical politics become prominent.   Though I might be wrong about that."

Instead, there's little activity, but most of what I've seen encompasses much of the Death of God crowd, which kind of frustrates me. What's the point of using the label of Christianity or having any kind of conversation within that fold, if you're not interested in whether God exists or answering the question of whether or not Christ was who he said he was? You can easily have all those conversations under many of the other -ism umbrellas. Just seems pointless to me."
RadicalChristianity,39pv26,PokerPirate,6,Sun Jun 14 02:13:46 2015 UTC,"First, some death of God theologies do think that Jesus was literally God and the messiah. See Thomas Altizer as the most prominent example. For Thomas Altizer, the death of God can be understood in a couple of different ways: 1st) the death of God refers to our existential situation after Auschwitz, 2nd) that the death of God is a renewal of the apocalypse and the Cross, and 3rd) that the only way God is the living God of the bible is when God has died.  I think DoG thought is relevant to the discussion here, yet...   about how the teachings of Christ could be applied to the ideas of radically changing our governments, societies, and economies   For many radical Christians, here and historically this could mean several different things. Is violence an unavoidable sin in certain situations?(Bonhoeffer) or does God sanction violence?(Muntzer) That's only one example; what is our standpoint in other words? Is it Jesus of the Sermon of the Mount? Is it Jesus at the Temple? Or is it Jesus on the Cross?   I wanna see people talking about smashing the state and elevating the low   I think it ebbs and flows.

It seems to suggest ""we"" are in a position to simply re-engineer away all of our problems and satisfy all of ""our"" desires.   My understanding of the current fossil fuel situation is that 1) we have no idea how to replace our current energy needs (obviously insufficient the world's poor at present) with renewables, 2) it would be prudent for everyone in the wealthy world to begin cutting back energy usage as much as possible now rather than later.

Lacan & Zizek are both thoroughly atheistic and would say that there is no Other behind the big Other; there is no ultimate guarantor of meaning or cohesion. What the author is describing when he uses the term ""big Other,"" is, in Lacanian/Zizekian terms, something more like point de capiton or the phallus, though those terms still do not indicate guarantor, but something presumed to guarantee meaning or cohesion or which does so on the imaginary level as a kind of necessary or useful lie to help keep us sane."

If you don't feel like you can live a fulfilling life in God, then give up God. I would suggest maybe running with it and seeing how it goes.   Christianity is a lie, it's based on lies. Examples: Monolatry was imposed by force on israelites in the post-exilic period. Early israelites were polytheists. Trinity was also imposed by force. New Testament is a bunch of lies, with no relation to the historical Jesus. Pentecosts, for example, was an intelligent move: before it, the authority was with the real followers of Jesus; after, with the ones who had an mystical experience with the Spirit/Christ. The myth of resurrection probably was born in the midst of this mystical experiences with Christ. And early Christians were obscurantists and ignorants.  I'm not confounding lie with myth. I know it's impossible to live without myths. But I can't take anything good from a so bad and oppressive system as is Christianity and the Bible.

Sure, it might be a lie if you consider it to be lying about presenting a literal history, but I don't think that it needs to be understood in that way (Jewish people don't understand the OT as literal history). I don't think that it matters if the historical Jesus lines up with the biblical one, in the same way I don't think that it matters whether or not Moses existed.   In terms of the oppressiveness. I think that any belief system has the ability to become oppressive. We see this in communism, capitalism, monarchism, etc., so I don't see why we should treat Christianity any different from these concepts. None of these things are corrupt or oppressive in and of themselves, but each can be used as a tool for oppression.

RadicalChristianity,38u9el,solxyz,3,Sun Jun 7 04:14:19 2015 UTC,"And 90% of times, God is used to oppress people.   Thats not my experience at all. I suppose it depends on our backgrounds, geography, churches, etc. But in my experience, and the experience of the few people that I talk to about these matters (a self-selecting crowd to be sure), the religion of God has been 80% a healing and empowering force. I see all the potential for oppression there, and I understand that such oppression does go on in some circles (in fact, I see it in a lot of subtle ways in my church, but I find that the good far out weighs the bad), but I think you should consider re-evaluating the extent of the problem.  Second, even if ""God"" is usually used for oppression, I dont that that doing away with ""God"" is a viable solution. In short, I think that we need God in order to live fully human and liberated lives. Of course it doesnt have to be called ""God."" It doesnt even have to be called ""Christ"" (although that is important to me). But we need to have reference and access and orientation to the absolute, the transcendent, the awakened, the holy, the liberating truth, the living word, etc. You can find this in buddhism - and if Christianity gives you too much of a headache, maybe you should go over there for a while - but in this language and culture ""God"" is the central vehicle for all of this. Thus in my view the only option is the struggle to announce the good news through the haze of distortions of the very words and institutions that we have to make the announcement.  But that is just my approach, based on my context and history. The main thing is to find a path that works for you.

I think you're making a mistake grouping all types of religion, without regard for their differences. I think you'd find a great many people disagreeing with you. Not all religion is 'oppressive'. Belief in a higher power does not intrinsically force you to obscure truth and oppress the innocent. In fact, a great many portions of the bible tell you to do the exact opposite. I don't think anyone would disagree that certain portions of all Christio-Judaeic texts are extremely cruel, and even come across as vindictive, but I personally take them similar to the (liberal) Quaker view. They are inspired by the divine, but written by human hands. Testimony. Easily corrupted as anything made by man.  Maybe it is based on a lie, however, without proof either way, I like to take the good from it, rather than (my own view) of the bad, and hope that anything that resembles a merciful god would be willing to forgive that.

As I said, even if we build a ""good concept of God"", 90% of times, God will be used to oppress. God is always an interpretation. This is universal.  The problem with Bible is not just the cruelty, is that it is result of bad politics. The imposition of monolatry was violence upon traditional religious knowledge. The Exodus is an extreme nationalist, violent and political book. I can't use it for liberation, for example. That's dishonesty for me. Today's Christianity is a farce and has nothing to do with Jesus. I know some people creates a difference between historical Jesus and the Christ of faith, but I can't do that.

I can understand, and I respect the fact you lay out, that twisting of a religion or of faith will be used to oppress the masses, and is done more often than not. In response to the bit about Exodus, I'd say that, although some portions of the bible come across as downright oppressive, you do have portions that are extremely complimentary to liberation theology, and Socialistic/Communistic ideals: Psalm 9:9, for example,   https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%209:9, or Isiah 1:17. https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%201:17.  I do agree with you, however, that the twisting and the proverbial rape of religion is an issue, simply because today's Christianity is less and less about Christ than it is about furthering ones ends(I hope I'm understanding you correctly, I'm a tad groggy today.). You do lay out a good argument, however, but I would contest you saying that Ethics are better without religion. If you look at Ethics developed outside of an explicitly religious context, they fall prey to the same issues that morals do within a religious context, that is, they can be twisted, and are subject to the bare fact that the hearts of men are quick to change, and can't be held to the expectation they'll remain firm and loyal to those ethics."

When a person views a concept as immense as God and see themselves in the reflection, they act like gods even though they are mere men.   My personal idea of God is based on his attitude and one of his earlier names - Elohim or ""the powers that be"". Imagine a mind who was able to learn everything there is to learn. A mind who understands the Theory of Everything.   The very word ""I am"", when we as mortals use it is limited to a very narrow context. ""I am a son, a father, a programmer"". How does ""I am"" change when a mind learns everything there is to learn? No longer bound by narrow contexts, but rather, encompassing all of them.  A Hebrew asked for his name. He was complex.

RadicalChristianity,38gbpn,pieman3141,4,Thu Jun 4 21:02:46 2015 UTC,"I missed the last one. Mea culpa. I'm mostly being whiny about this one, because it's a commonly read piece in my field of study.  My angle generally comes from a cultural level: Adorno is being very critical of mass culture as stultifying the masses, which is incompatible with the field of communications. Adorno comes off as extremely elitist here, and that sorta pisses me off. Why? Because even though he is right to critique mass culture, the end result (to discard it) leaves a LOT of people out in the cold. It's really easy to think of consumers as dupes, when the situation is far more complicated.  From a radical Christianity POV, though? It's something worth thinking about, because on one hand, we have to criticize all powers and principalities. On the other, the idea of (intellectually) leaving people out in the cold is terribly wrong. The mass media is often accused of being emotional and affect-based, which leads to favouring logic and reason. This, as many feminists point out, is masculinist/classist/racist thinking because it favours males and people of a certain class and race that can afford to have the time to learn about these things and strip away all the trappings of culture."
RadicalChristianity,38gbpn,Mashburned,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:21:08 2015 UTC,"Help me understand: what space are people being left out of?  Compared to Adorno, what does a similarly comprehensive but more inclusive critique of mass media look like?"
RadicalChristianity,38gbpn,pieman3141,2,Sat Jun 6 00:48:28 2015 UTC,"A more inclusive critique of mass media would acknowledge that the people involved in consumption and negotiation (I'm using Gramsci's notion of hegemony here) receive mass media differently, based on all sorts of factors (gender, class, ethnicity, race). In short, intersectionality would have to be acknowledged in order to even begin a more inclusive critique. White culture has a thread where if you're educated, you'll have preferences towards certain tastes and ways of thinking - the more educated/rich you are, the more logical you become. Other ethno-socio-economic classes may not have this backing, or may default to the tastes according to the ruling elite.  Walter Benjamin is much better at critiquing how media works, I think, although he doesn't truly address it. Likewise, public sphere theorists and feminist theorists in the 1980s and 1990s have addressed this issue better."
RadicalChristianity,38gbpn,Mashburned,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:57:43 2015 UTC,"Ah.  My initial impression was that Adorno (at least in this piece) wasn't all that careless in his specific claims re: the effects of consumption, but I suppose if I sat with it more there are a couple of moments of generalization that you could really break apart with a look toward intersectionality."
RadicalChristianity,38gbpn,nosewings,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:11:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of this resonates with me.  I took a media class recently, and the professor spent a lot of time talking about the ways that media influence us. That's not bad -- that's a good thing to talk about. But the way she went about it bothered me. It's hard to explain, but the way she talked always seemed to cast the mass-media makers as completely dominant, almost mind-controlling the masses. And while mass media definitely is a tool for cultural control -- intentional or not -- it seemed like she was implicitly denying the ""masses"" any agency at all. She spoke as if mass culture were simply handed down from on high, rather than a process that we participate in."

RadicalChristianity,38a3wc,SammyTheKitty,3,Wed Jun 3 15:00:43 2015 UTC,Point 2 captures exactly what I was trying to say in ten times fewer the words.
RadicalChristianity,38a3wc,ratherephemeral,7,Wed Jun 3 20:53:00 2015 UTC,"First of all, thanks for bringing this up. I am not a Trans* person and thus I will not comment specifically on Trans identity, since I really can't tell you what its like to be Transgendered. I have experimented with cross-dressing and have worn skirts as part of a solidarity march but that's not the same thing.   First and foremost, as a sociologist I recognize that in terms of media portrayal, it is being Trans* that is  Caitlyn's master status. However, in terms of actually-existing material conditions, Caitlyn's master status is still as bourgeosie or at least petty-bourgeosie in that she still benefits from the prevalence of white supremacy and imperialism, facilitated by primitive accumulation and exploitation. While this is a victory in terms of subjective perceptions of Trans* people, it is basically nil in terms of objective * improvements for Trans people. Many of which, such as Two Spirit folk among First Nations or the recently murdered black women, face the ""double chains"" of imperialism and transphobia. Liberal media may become more accepting of portrayal of Trans* people, but not in the improvement of conditions for Trans* people, who face much of their oppression through the capitalist prison, policing, and work system(s).   In regards to TERFs, these ""Feminists"" tend to come from a position of relative comfort of a petty-bourgeoisie academic and/or political privilege usually in the form of ties to the Democratic party (think Naomi Wolff) or generally through white privilege. I tend to disregard them as a corruption of Women's and LGBTQ2S people through Capitalism. It's a story as old as capitalism itself. If they invade social movements/ safe spaces/ mobilization committees, my fellow Communists will usually side with the Trans* and Indigenous people and work to exclude any form of repression.   In terms of theology, I'm not sure what this means. Certainly Caitlyn's statements while on the cover of Vogue were quite poetic and I think that it does describe the process of transition quite beautifully. I definitely see it as a continuation as a Queering of the Stations of the Cross."
RadicalChristianity,38a3wc,BabyRhinoAbe,8,Tue Jun 2 22:10:26 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I have nothing to say other than I intend to upvote only those comments coming from trans folks themselves (and leaving the rest alone).

RadicalChristianity,38a3wc,TheBaconMenace,10,Wed Jun 3 05:16:31 2015 UTC,"Coming from a genderqueer perspective I have some academic/philosophical criticisms of the concept of trans as an identity.  By that I mean that these are 'dry' concerns, not intended to marginalize or exclude trans lived experience and more leveled at our theory of gender.    Simply put, I'm afraid that trans as an identity inadvertently serves as a continuation of heteronormativity.  FtM and MtF happen to be true descriptors for a narrative that people experience and might in a certain context be the best labels with which to quickly communicate those narratives.  But strictly speaking, the FtM doesn't identify as FtM.  The FtM is Male, or (to put it in queer terms) associates their self with attributes of sexuality generally associated with masculinity.    Do you see the problem?  We're still stuck with terminology that enforces a gender binary, an either-or, a normative feminity and a normative masculinity.  It's as if we had identity terms that differentiated between a gay person closeted all the way to their death and someone who comes out as gay at 15: the narrative doesn't determine what that person's preferred identity was.    Having said that, I find TERFs insufferable, and perhaps that's for similar reason: it implies ownership of feminity or masculinity that is impossible.  For the liberated genderqueer, all facets of sexuality are accessible to all, the lines between people based on genitalia are dissolved, there is neither male nor female, and so on."
RadicalChristianity,38a3wc,ratherephemeral,5,Tue Jun 2 22:05:18 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on rejecting the binary. I think that most people, if they're honest and introspective, will recognize themselves as not fitting ""Masculinity"" or ""Femininity"" perfectly—or even terribly well. Not to go too Haraway on this, but I think we're all interlopers, with fluctuating and varying degrees of success at (or desire for) ""passing."" The state of being trans* can be seen, in part, as a foregrounding of that tension."
RadicalChristianity,38a3wc,wordsmythe,6,Thu Jun 4 19:48:16 2015 UTC,"Do you see the problem?   I understand what you are saying, and I see the problem that you are addressing. That said, there are people who identify as trans, nonbinary, queer, two-spirit, etc., who fall outside of this dichotomy.   I feel uncomfortable telling someone what they are or aren't allowed to identify as. If a FtM person identifies as male, then they are male. I see how that is problematic at a systemic level, but not at a personal level. I think this is the problem I see with the critique: is that it wants to attack the system, but ends up hurting individuals."

My critique is of the dichotomy.     a FtM person identifies as male, then they are male.   Exactly.  But it's 'easier' to describe them as FtM.  They are more male than they are FtM, right?  Referring to someone as ""FtM' means their birth status still matters more than their actual identity.    And I'm not trying to say that the FtM part isn't relevant information in such an individual's life story; I'm trying to say that it is not their identity itself."

I would say go outside and meet someone who is trans or identifies as a ""minority"" gender representation.  Dogma and ideology are always just that.  As someone who has tried to talk about gender and has always failed, my new policy is this...  ""As in heresiology, polemics sets itself the task of determining the intangible point of dogma, the fundamental and necessary principle that the adversary has neglected, ignored or transgressed; and it denounces this negligence as a moral failing; at the root of the error, it finds passion, desire, interest, a whole series of weaknesses and inadmissible attachments that establish it as culpable. As in judiciary practice, polemics allows for no possibility of an equal discussion: it examines a case; it isn't dealing with an interlocutor, it is processing a suspect; it collects the proofs of his guilt, designates the infraction he has committed, and pronounces the verdict and sentences him. In any case, what we have here is not on the order of a shared investigation; the polemicist tells the truth in the form of his judgment and by virtue of the authority he has conferred on himself.""  From an interview with Foucault  This approach will also probably not work."

A vivid example would be when there are fraternal twins, with one a male XX and female XY. Fetal androgen exposure from the XX fetus' development of male sex characteristics results in androgenization of the XY fetus.

(Butler 1999, 10–11)   For Butler, sexed bodies never exist outside social meanings and how we understand gender shapes how we understand sex (1999, 139). Sexed bodies are not empty matter on which gender is constructed and sex categories are not picked out on the basis of objective features of the world. Instead, our sexed bodies are themselves discursively constructed: they are the way they are, at least to a substantial extent, because of what is attributed to sexed bodies and how they are classified (for discursive construction, see Haslanger 1995, 99). Sex assignment (calling someone female or male) is normative (Butler 1993, 1).[6] When the doctor calls a newly born infant a girl or a boy, s/he is not making a descriptive claim, but a normative one. In fact, the doctor is performing an illocutionary speech act (see the entry on Speech Acts). In effect, the doctor's utterance makes infants into girls or boys. We, then, engage in activities that make it seem as if sexes naturally come in two and that being female or male is an objective feature of the world, rather than being a consequence of certain constitutive acts (that is, rather than being performative). And this is what Butler means in saying that physical bodies never exist outside cultural and social meanings, and that sex is as socially constructed as gender. She does not deny that physical bodies exist. But, she takes our understanding of this existence to be a product of social conditioning: social conditioning makes the existence of physical bodies intelligible to us by discursively constructing sexed bodies through certain constitutive acts.

Jacobin's main politics is so dusty and geriatric that it shouldn't be talking   I'd agree with you if you're talking electoralism and democratic socialism, they are definitely dead.

However, this is not a real critique yet forms the backbone of your argument. What about Jacobin is geriatric?    how culturally foreign the general project of socialism is to this country   This is completely false. Socialism has permeated and shaped American politics for most of the twentieth century. Furthermore, America is not a monolith. It is a colonial entity occupying and oppressing several other nations, the (New) Afrikan, Indigenous, Aztlán & Borikén cultures have always had some level of socialistic or communalistic social values and structures. They also form the hard-core of proletarians in occupied Turtle Island.    you run into the same dysfunctional backwater irrelevance the Left has struggled for years   The Left is not irrelevant, it is simply experiencing difficulty due to the defeat or decline of other socialist projects. 'The Left' as you refer to us as, is massive and mobilized on every continent on Earth, including North America. Quebec has experienced its largest strike in recent history, with almost 400,000 participants.

Socialism has a history in America, for example, but it's not really a ""permeation""--true, socialism has some positions in office and the workers' movement in the first half of the twentieth-century was significant, but there's a reason Bernie Sanders will never get past the primaries--he's a ""socialist,"" which means he's not to be taken seriously by the majority of American persons.  I don't think that means we should settle for the American political system, but at the same time I'm not putting my eggs in the basket of a perceived revolutionary vanguard. A real revolution would be a lot more mundane, a lot more concerned with working to change the subjectivities of regular folks--and that means white, suburban folks. That's the hard work of revolutionary theory today, imo, despite the fact that so much of what you're saying is exactly right (especially re: the Left not being wholly irrelevant and your attention to racism).  On that, I think the ""proselytized hippy movement"" has more going for it. Though even that phrase sounds a little too exciting.

Sorry older people to suggest that geriatrics should be associated with outmoded socialisms. :)  Roberts rules and 3/4 majority seem to also be in use among the more orthodox radical groups around here like the International Socialist Organization chapters and Chicago Black Rose Anarchist Federation. And then many of the black-led groups have leaders in a collective that make many of the decisions.  Like you said, its easy to teach and somewhat practice consensus which is why I don't make too big of a fuss. We actually had a split over process two years ago which devastated the group. I can't help but roll my eyes at some of this -like a small collective (or medium with many supporters as ours is) really is all that different. And like you've pointed out Occupy and other groups have laid the tradition a bit so as to make getting it done an easier, trodden path. The Rules tends to leave noobies in the dust. For spontaneous blockades ('riots') its basically the most experienced leading the crowd to do certain things."

RadicalChristianity,37mf40,TheBaconMenace,4,Fri May 29 18:58:36 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say ""they"" because I don't think there's an antecedent for the pronoun. Rights don't exist; they were made up. Rights language was created in a particular context largely for the protection of particular persons. It leads primarily to defensive postures and competition rather than invoking creativity and cooperation. Moreover, as a political construction developed by and for white males in the history of European colonialism, we should be reasonably suspicious about its merits--despite the fact that it has been mobilized to appeal to that very group. Using rights language still maintains the structural problems of a capitalist society that co-emerged with the invention of ""rights"" as a construction.  Simone Weil has suggested using ""obligation"" language instead of rights language. On her view, if we appealed to a natural obligation to help someone else, or to give them justice, etc., rather than ""natural rights,"" we would be in a better position to advocate a more common understanding of humanity. I'm more congenial to that, though I don't think it leaves room for real mutuality--but if you're going to have a one-sided political construction, putting that on the side of obligations rather than rights is a lot more encouraging.  Suffice it to say, there's no such ""thing"" as a ""human right."""

I am a faithful Pentecostal and the church is supposed to be the body of Christ and a body of Christ that is devoted to the spreading of the Holy Spirit. For most Pentecostals, this is a horridly reactionary and violent attack on autonomy, and this disturbs me. We are supposed to be able to judge by the fruits of the Spirit, and where is the Spirit in the celebration of rigid gender roles, extreme legalistic moralism and exclusion? Yet, for many Pentecostals, this is Christianity and the Church.  I'm not really interested in a physical church, as much as I am concerned about the spiritual. Don't get me wrong, I am just as involved in real life activities, but it bothers me that Pentecostal churches use fear, alienation, and shallow piety to call all people to salvation. I am a filthy sinner and so are all people, but screaming this fact to people is Pharisaical hypocrisy. Aren't we called to exorcise demons? Heal the ill? Liberate the oppressed? That's how we should be calling people to salvation.  I dunno. I just don't have a lot of faith in ""church"""

RadicalChristianity,37i1w3,TheBaconMenace,1 point,Wed May 27 22:58:55 2015 UTC,"Welcome OP and congratulations on raising, what I think is important issue to for many of us, as your first contribution to the sub (kind of making me wish I asked this to be honest)!  On balance I don't have a huge problem with the FAQ section you cite. I'm a regular worship leader in a denomination (openly) founded in my country in the late 1700s (so OP may consider this to be an 'older denomination') by persecuted religious liberals. Because of this the denomination is very marked, for better or worse, by the the ideas of the bourgeois liberalism (at the time a revolutionary ideology, illustrated by the French revolution a few years later). So while the denomination was more recently among the first to support the rights of LGBTQI people for example, it can be harder to get it to take a firm stand on economic issues (although it recently voted to campaign against TTIP). It also suffers from being disproportionately middle class (I'm about to publish a study on this, hopefully later this year).  However I'm very settled in my church and for all my criticisms look forward to every Sunday and even hope one day to become a minister! I've found it relativity easy to be part of a church and freely express my own opinion (and listen to those of others) and I'm very grateful for this. I know this won't be the case for everyone on this sub however.  Anyway getting back to OPs points, as much as I like the FAQ, the OP dose have a point that some church structures are better then others. Just look at the way Herbert McCabe was treated by his church. However McCabe never walked away from his church. While it may be easier to be a radical Christian in (or out of) some church groups then others, that has not stopped radical Christians from existing in every church I can think of. On the rare occasion when people on this sub talk about their backgrounds I'm always amazed by the diversity. Sure the mods could change the FAQ to reflect different levels of oppression in different churches but I think this could easily turn out to be a mistake as it could create the false impression that it is impossible to be radical and still be in X, Y, Z group.  I'm very exited to hear more opinions from others on this!"

RadicalChristianity,375x81,SkoopDaHoop,0,Fri May 29 00:29:50 2015 UTC,"Stay a while and listen  I'll give you the benefit that you aren't trolling, and respond.    Do you think God would have corrected them? The men who wrote the bible were writing down the word of God, do you think that men with personal authority from Jesus would be so disrespectful to the embodiment of perfection (God) and their own creator as to change God's gender?    There are a number of things that can be unpacked from this. First, lets examine gender. Gender is socially constructed. Depending on who you read, that will mean different things. In any case, our categories of male and female are pretty arbitrary, and aren't nearly as clean cut in reality as we want them to be. God doesn't have a gender. God isn't a man or a woman. God is God. No matter what you think about that, God is never understood as a man in scripture. The Bible usually refers to God using male pronouns, but this isn't always the case. I don't think that it's disrespectful to refer to God using male pronouns; I don't think that it's disrespectful to refer to God using female pronouns; I don't think that it's disrespectful to refer to God using gender neutral or non-binary pronouns. God doesn't have a gender, and it's only because we think of things as gendered (in English, some other languages don't have this problem) that we are are stuck with (traditionally) referring to God by male or female pronouns.   Second. We seem to have a different understanding of who or what exactly God is. This is ok. I don't understand God as a metaphysical entity that is looking down at us from heaven. I do hold onto God in the Tillich Ground of Being, and I believe that the Holy Spirit works without our world, constantly. I'm not exactly sure what that means, but I believe that she is constantly at work in this world. I would admit that I reject God as traditionally thought about.    If the gender assigning is incorrect, how much more in the Bible is incorrect? What is reliable? If the writers were so dishonest that they changed God's gender on their own account, what else could they have lied about?   To suggest that they are incorrect about God's gender isn't what I want to say. All I want to say is that God isn't gendered, but that we use gendered pronouns to refer to them because it is the way that English works. I don't thing that God is a man, I don't think that God is a woman.  In terms of reliability about the bible, I don't really care if the bible is reliable in the sense of believing that everything in it necessarily occurred, physically, on this earth. The bible is telling us about our relationship to God and to the world. It tells us about how we should treat others, and how we should treat God. I wouldn't suspect that those who wrote the book would lie about anything.   I want to share what is one of my favorite passages about truth. It comes from the end of Brian Massumi's forward to A Thousand Plateaus by Deleuze and Guattari.   The question is not: is it truth? But: does it work? What new thoughts does it make possible to think? What new emotions does it make possible to feel? What new sensations and perceptions does it open in the body?   That is how I feel feel about, and go towards the Bible.   I assume from your post that you are new to this community. I would encourage you to spend some time looking around these boards so that you might better understand them. We'll be happy to answer any of your questions, so long as you don't seem hostile. : )"
RadicalChristianity,375x81,wake3d,3,Fri May 29 00:54:24 2015 UTC,"I'll give you the benefit that you aren't trolling, and respond.   Now, I was not hostile or trolling, but I am genuine. No need to throw that out there.  I think the Bible refers to God as ""Father"", ""He"", ""His"", etc. because those words give off a feeling of authority and protection which people through the ages all see when they hear those words.   I agree - God has no Sex.   Now that we agree on that - why would you insist on giving God female pronouns (intentionally), though? Is it not more important to focus more on spreading His Word and the Gospel?   I look at your earlier comment,    I prefer to use female pronouns when talking about God. It helps undermine the patriarchy that is often dominant in Christianity. God isn't gendered, so there is no reason to always use male pronouns.   What is this ""patriarchy"" you speak of? I look it up and see this:   ""a system of society or government in which the father or eldest male is head of the family and descent is traced through the male line.""  This actually seems accurate to describe the Christian family, so I look up what the Bible says:  http://www.openbible.info/topics/the_role_of_the_man  Here are a few verses from the Bible on ""patriarchy"" or general male leadership in the family.  1 Timothy 3:4   He must manage his own household well, with all dignity keeping his children submissive,   1 Peter 3:7    Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.   Ephesians 5:23   For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior.   Now, These verses are controversial these days I notice. I did look around for what fits Male Leadership and authority the best, though.   But we see in these verses - the man seems to have an obligation and God-given role to lead the family under himself.  However - I don't think man is better than woman, and I do not see women as my ""slave""(Ephesians 5:22-24, 22 Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. 23 For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body. 24 Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything). Look at this comic below to understand what I mean.  http://adam4d.com/wives-husbands/  So really, as far as your negative views on ""Patriarchy"" and using female pronouns for God - as a Christian, do you see the Bible's views on our roles?   Don't you think that men were put in the leading authority by God? Because every soul is put into a unique situation with their own burdens, tests, and trials - and as much as a man could have it easier in some places and have burdens in others, doesn't the woman also?"

RadicalChristianity,374jsi,Triplanetary,2,Tue May 26 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"I'm an atheist but I can almost see what she might be getting at*. The secularization of Western society coincided with the rise of capitalism, and not coincidentally. Medieval European society wove religious thought and belief into every facet of life, from the mundane to the grand. The extent to which medieval Europeans saw their religious belief reflected in their everyday world is difficult for us 21st century people to even begin to relate to. There wasn't really a place for capitalists in that world. I mean, obviously capitalists first arose in that world, but they couldn't shape it to the extent they required - naked profit-seeking was beneath the aristocracy and offensive to the clergy. Hence why the classical liberal thinkers were so eager to champion secularization.  Obviously I'm not opposed to secular society in itself, what with me being an atheist and all. It's one of a few aspects of capitalist society, such as urbanization, that will probably serve humanity well once they're freed from the capitalist economic base. But it's still important to realize that secularization happened because it was of benefit to the capitalists. And it's certain that the capitalist pursuit of profit over and above virtually any other concern - such as, in this case, protecting the environment - would have been shocking to a medieval European society.  Blaming this on atheism, though, is akin to blaming Christianity for the fall of Rome. The rise of Christianity and the fall of Rome are inextricable intertwined, but that doesn't mean one caused the other or that Rome wouldn't have fallen if Christianity had never existed (it obviously would have).  * I'm probably giving her too much credit, though. When she said, ""there is more to the world than what we can see with our limited eyes,"" I was like, well sure, I can't see radio waves for example.

With that said, I disagree with some of the things she's said, although I don't want to minimize her experiences:   Now, I’m aware of what most radical atheist cite as their hatred for religion: that it is rooted in the violence and imperialism of the western Christian church.   I don't think this is what atheists, at least radical atheists critique the Church on. Or, if it is, it's not the only reason. Most atheists disavow religion because they believe it's irrational, and because the majority of religions promote a structured, near dictatorial hierarchy incompatible with socialism/anarchism/Marxism.   This not only ignores the ways in which science and spirituality can and do overlap, but ignores the fact that western science is inherently colonial, racist, transphobic, and ableist.   I don't know where ""science and spirituality"" overlap, and calling ""western science"" ""inherently colonial, racist, transphobic, and ableist"" is nonsense, and is offensive to anyone who's actually suffered colonialism/transphobia/racism/ableism/whatever.   It’s also important to remember that when some atheist tries to tell you that your faith makes you opposed to science, ask them why they ignore the scientific evidence that points to tangible benefits in prayer, meditation, and positive thinking.  Ask them why they ignore the scientific evidence that proves to us that there is more to the world than what we can see with our limited eyes, or that there are things that science can’t explain that we know exist anyway.  Ask them why they ignore these facts, that could be helpful and empowering, just because they don’t want to come across as some apolitical “hippie.”   This ""scientific evidence"" she refers to does not exist, and neither do the ""facts"". I really dislike scientism and narrow forms of reductionism but that does not excuse peddling bullshit.  But, at the end of the day, there are plenty of viewpoints people hold that I, personally, think are irrational, yet that doesn't prevent someone from being a good or radical person. There are a lot of people who think Bentham is a better philosopher than Kant, and I would disagree, but I'm not going to judge them or treat them poorly from it.  People shouldn't expect everyone in the world to think in the exact same way they do."

It often does take the form of insisting on ""logic"", ""rationality"", and ""science"". I find rigid atheists missing out on a lot of criticisms of modernism generally that anyone could have learned about in college humanities classes. The progressive Christians I hang out with seem to be much more pluralistic and intuitively in tune with recent insights in that respect.  But I dunno if this is per say 'hurtful' or unduly 'alienating' to me. There will always be people with a certain tendency towards literalism, dogmatism, and modernism in any social group, right? I don't take it as directed towards my person, even if there is a comment directed towards me.   Also, the groups and individuals expressing exclusionary views towards religious/spiritual people generally are also some rigid, old school form of leftism."

RadicalChristianity,36g7wz,JacobStirner,3,Tue May 19 03:35:04 2015 UTC,""" The visions and feelings described in Milton are typical of schizophrenia.  A new star appeared in the sky.  It entered Blake's body, filling him with both terror and exultation.  The star was a man from a world beyond time and space.  His appearance affected the spirits of all people.  Nothing like this had ever happened before.  The sky was shattered and the apocalypse was about to begin.  Space and time were transformed and Blake entered a new world. The Lord of Inspiration overwhelmed and became one with the visionary.  Other spiritual forces opposed them.  The world appeared strange, an atmosphere of majesty pervaded the whole.  All objects were alive and humanized.  Strange powers that control mortal life loomed around the poet.  Ghostly forms flickered in darkness.  Cosmic truths became apparent.  Later, the visionary greeted a solitary spirit descending on the wind.  Next, there was a tumultuous vision of the end of the world.  In a moment, the visionary glimpsed the greater reality that will supersede it.  Overwhelmed by his rapture, he collapsed.  Around one adult in one hundred has schizophrenia.  Every day, these people experience things like those Blake shared with us.  I can think of no better way to try to enter this wonderful world of human experience than through the eyes and ears of William Blake.  Some readers may feel uncomfortable with a style that is related to an abnormal state of the brain.  But every artist has an individual style and a particular mode of self-expression.  Blake is a poet who celebrates the world's beauty, the world of children, the struggle for a just society, and the fascination of the supernatural.  He expressed these interests through the medium of schizophrenic art.  Both style and content are interesting and valuable.  How much of Blake's system is the direct result of his schizophrenia is an open question, but it helps us understand most of his metaphysics.  Being aware of the transcendental realms, Blake denounced the pretensions of natural science, and urged everyone to try to see his visions and forget earthly concerns.  The familiar world is unreal, an error resulting from our closed perceptions.  All things happen because of the activity of spirits [69].  Blake's hated ""Spectre"" was the portion of himself that tried to direct his interests to the material world.  The real Blake lived in the visionary world even when his mortal self lived in the London slums.  His true personality filled the universe, he was all things, and he was filled with love for all people.""  Best part of the whole thing."

RadicalChristianity,3682zt,Mysterious_Drifter,6,Sun May 17 02:02:54 2015 UTC,"I have a story, I'm going to copy off from Asimov's:  There was a civilization that existed in a Universe at one time. That civilization built a real AI. In the beginning, it was the size of a football field. The computer helped them build their first spaceship and they traveled to the nearest planet. As time went on, technology improved and the computer got smaller. That civilization travelled space and encountered others like them - some more advanced. No wars happened, because the only way a civilization gets to that point is if they cooperate - they are not decimated by their own wars.  The stars begin to die. The Universe was freezing. In order to conserve energy, the entire collective civilization of that Universe merged their minds and put their bodies into stasis pods. That was easier to maintain and less costly. As time moved on, some pods were shut down - but the mind remained, the body died, but not the consciousness. That happened until all pods were shut down - but the merged minds were still stored in the computer.  As time went on, everyone become one entity - united. As time went on, the entity unlocked the Theory of Everything. The entity gained the ability to create a Universe. And so, in the beginning Elohim said: ""Let there be light"", and there was light. He also said, let US create man in OUR image.  The thing about the Hebrew word - Elohim - is that it is plural. It has the suffix - ""im"". Might have happened that way. Universes begin and die, who knows how many came before this one. It is very likely that in the first one, at least one civilization in the countless planets that existed, was able to do something like that.  God is therefore like us - subject to the laws of this Universe. He is inside it, but, since he knows the Theory of Everything, he has the ability to create advanced technology. Immortal flesh for example, can be described as:   Daniel 10:6 His body was like topaz, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude.   You can upload a mind into a body like that without the need for ""magic"". When Paul said: ""There are different types of flesh"" and that ""the mortal must clothe itself in immortality"", he might have seen a mortal flesh through advanced technology, being turned into someone that looks like what Daniel described. Paul also said, he knew a man who was taken into ""the third level of heaven"" and saw ""things which are unlawful to speak of"". He might have seen that."

RadicalChristianity,3682zt,peter-son-of-john,2,Mon May 18 21:07:35 2015 UTC,"transhumanism   Angels seems to have been described as looking like lightning as well:   Matthew 28:2-3 And behold, a severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it. And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow.    The transfiguration also:   Matthew 17:2 There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.   It might look like this painting by Akiane.  Paul has stories of a man he knew ""who was caught up to the third heaven, who was caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things, things that no one is permitted to tell"". A lot of the visions of John in Revelations can be interpreted literally, even the description of the new city of Jerusalem, which ""descends from heaven onto a new earth which has no seas""."
RadicalChristianity,3682zt,freudianfraudster,10,Tue May 19 04:19:22 2015 UTC,"Everything we come into contact on a daily basis is purely material.   No, actually none of it is.  I recommend a few doses of Berkeley for taking life as it is presented rather than how it is commonly interpreted, and several more of Kierkegaard for finding something beyond doubt by finding it in the experience itself rather than in the interpretation.  I have always found that belief in God and believable arguments for God only come within the context of a philosophical system or a particular way of life. If the question is examined by itself, without considerations elsewhere, plenty of objections can be raised to any solution. However, this seems to be the case with just about any question. You will not find belief in God by asking for a reason. The belief has to make sense within the context of who you are and what you believe."

RadicalChristianity,3682zt,thepibbs,3,Sun May 17 18:17:55 2015 UTC,"There are several related controversies at play. The view I expressed in my comment is a formulation of representationalism (or ""indirect realism""): our knowledge of the external world is only a representation based on ideas or ""sense-data"". This corresponds to the empiricism accepted by the natural sciences: our knowledge of nature is only available through measurements mediated by our senses. George Berkeley took empiricism to an extreme by denying the material existence of objects and holding that all objects (and qualities, motion, etc...) exist only as ideas perceived by a mind (ultimately by the mind of God). A relevant SEP article is ""Epistemological Problems of Perception""  As to whether ideas/sense-datum should be considered material or not is another issue. Physicalism holds that everything is or directly corresponds to something physical: ideas correspond to a certain pattern of neurons, for example. Some emergentist theories hold that physical objects can give rise to the non-physical (for example, an emergentist might say that while ideas depend upon or emerge from the central nervous system, ideas themselves are not physical). And of course there are dualist theories that hold that mind and body are two separate substances (raising the classical problem of how [it is possible that] they interact).  /u/thepibbs mentioned qualia, conscious sensations, which are often used in arguments against physicalism. The SEP has what looks like a good overview: ""Qualia: The Knowledge Argument"""

RadicalChristianity,3682zt,thepibbs,2,Mon May 18 00:17:05 2015 UTC,"For me, it was useful for me to take philosophy classes where I learned a couple things about the limits of ""materiality"":  1) the ""hard problem of consciousness"" (qualia and such) 2) abstract objects (numbers and sets)  Many philosophers regard consciousness and abstract objects as immaterial, but actually existing and major components of reality that are, in principle, irreducible to materiality. While substance dualism (the classic Cartesian ""soul"" or ""mind"") is a minority position nowadays, many, if not most philosophers are property dualists or agnostic on the question of consciousness. Secondly, my understanding is that the reality of abstract objects is pretty much the mainstream in philosophy of mathematics.  This is only a preliminary step for shifting out of the ""everything we experience is material"" ideology and exploring philosophical questions about the generative and organizing conditions of the physical."

So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.   Could the hard problem of consciousness be the spirit within every human? Similar language is used in Ecclesiastes:   I said in my heart with regard to the children of man that God is testing them that they may see that they themselves are but beasts. For what happens to the children of man and what happens to the beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath [or spirit], and man has no advantage over the beasts, for all is vanity. All go to one place. All are from the dust, and to dust all return. Who knows whether the spirit of man goes upwards and the spirit of the beast goes down into the earth?   This is notably different from the Greek understanding of the ""soul"", which most Christians believe is Biblical (which it ain't).   What do you think?"

I honestly have no idea whether we should identify these two uses of spirit with philosophical terminology. To what degree are Biblical understandings of ""spirit"" assuming the kinds of individuation and qualitative nuance that's part of the hard problem? Are animals really conscious in the same way as a human spirit?  I can see how someone would equate spirit and consciousness, but my own hermeneutics wants to maintain tension between the various Biblical writings and philosophical language.  How do you think about it?"

The question asked in 1 Corinthians, ""For who knows a person’s thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him?"" seems so similar to the hard problem that I couldn't help but make the connection."
