I know that it is not a country on your list, but I think that there will be a lot of similarities in the classroom. For starters you will need to provide your own teaching materials, all that was provided to me from my shcool was some pieces of chaulk and a chaulk board, all other projects and activities I had to create using local resources. The Classroom will be very large, my class was 75 students and this was on the smaller side, and they are very used to rote learning with no emphasis on critical thinking. Classroom dicipline will be difficult, child abuse is common in schools as a means of control, and can be as extreme as children being whipped by a chord for not passing an exam. This may be difficult for you to deal with, and some children will not listen to you because they know foreigners will not beat them. Also most school administrations are very corrupt, and can be very difficult to work with. That being said, it can be an immensely rewarding experience, and some students will be genuinely happy that you are there to help them, and will want to learn all they can from you.  Good luck and feel free to ask any questions."

I remember foreign teachers being appalled by how we'd get our bums whipped for failing an exam, or for making too much noise, or for being late, or for anything really.   My mother used to say African children can't learn anything without a stick, and I guess the government and teachers think the same.  Don't feel bad though, kids get used to it after a few years and I suppose it did make some students work harder.   Anyway, OP come to Arusha! It's a great place to teach. We have loads of schools that take in voluntourists and you can visit a lot of amazing places in your free time (Serengeti, Zanzibar, Mt. Kilimanjaro etc.).   Arusha also has a bit of a big expat community so you'll likely find folks from back home.

Africa,3d8qau,liotier,6,Tue Jul 14 11:25:31 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a fascinating book, will definitely look for it!  It is a sad reality that many African countries are facing. As i keep telling people 'the game is rigged'. Already in Kenya, any information on our mining sector is pretty much impossible to get. Nobody knows how much money anybody is making from some of the mineral deposits discovered in the past 5 years. And don't even get me started on how disgustingly perverse the aid and development system is. All it would take is closing all the tax loopholes and capital flight opportunities and we wouldn't need any money from these agencies. The depth of the collusion and collaboration that the corruption entails is incredible.  As i keep telling people, humanity in it's current form is completely overrated!"
Africa,3d8qau,ZangiefQueef,5,Tue Jul 14 13:03:59 2015 UTC,"But this is where I get annoyed with people who say ""this is the west"" - its everyone who mines in Africa and its our leaders fault that its this messed up.  We are not in the most powerful position negotiating with foreigners but our leaders undermine us so much to enrich themselves that we might never get a good deal.    It doesn't matter who mines here, if our leaders keep acting like self obsessed pigs we can never actually become wealthy.  Sadly so many people believe its the west and welcome the east with open arms and are blind to the fact that the same thing happens."
Africa,3d8qau,NoNameMonkey,3,Tue Jul 14 15:08:40 2015 UTC,"fwiw, i think many western countries struggle with the same perverse incentives. from a US perspective, i think the principle dynamics in campaign finance and tax evasion aren't all that different than the stories you hear about African corruption. it's just called lobbying (and other euphemisms) and dealt with through transparent disclosure rather than elimination of conflicts of interest. and if you dig deeper into the extraction industry, i think you'll find that towns/states who allow fracking in the US suffer the same kind of pressure to agree to a bad deal, with little upside relative the profits made my large nationals and multinationals, and likely some outright bribes to facilitate the agreements.   in that sense, it's hard for me to characterize the resource curse as an African problem--you see it in Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, even the West and China have shades of the same corruption from large business influences. the primary difference between these countries are the strengths of institutions--bureaucrats, police, judges, tax officials. and the West, insofar as it has arrived at better institutions, did not get there in a progressive, rational, just way. rather it was in fits and starts, usually precipitated by something brutal or catastrophic.   i don't think Africa (or any developing country) needs to develop the same way, but often times commenters understate just how hard it is to build fair institutions. it's easy to say good governance is needed, even to say one country has it and another does not. but what does it look like? how do you build it? we don't know. and as well intentioned as people's efforts are in a variety of spaces, the results don't always look very promising.  that said, i do feel by and large things are getting better. there's still potential for more improvement. even over the past ten years. nothing's perfect, some things are very bad, but sometimes i wish the conversation was less about what's wrong with Africa and more about the good that's being done and the potential for more."
Africa,3d8qau,mo-reeseCEO1,2,Tue Jul 14 17:12:03 2015 UTC,You make an important point here - and its one that I really wish more of my fellow Africans understood - this happens everywhere. But the degree of it is often determined by the leaders we have.
Africa,3d8qau,NoNameMonkey,4,Tue Jul 14 18:00:25 2015 UTC,"I will put it to you another way. One of the most important points in the article is that fuel and mineral exports from Africa in one year were worth more than 10 times the aid that flowed into the region. Basically, the same countries that are coming into Africa to save the world hold the institutional power to ensure that at least the majority of the value of our exports stays in our Countries. This is a step by step process, and in my opinion, and just like the author of the book illustrates in this interview, the power to create the transparency of where all our money is going lies with the same Countries that send their expatriates here to alleviate poverty and achieve the Millenium Development Goals. It is actually a sick and cruel joke that they come with peanuts whilst at the same time taking shiploads out (don't even get me started on the salaries and tax exemptions for expatriate aid and development workers!). The self-righteousness..... it is just an incredibly dark and cruel joke."
Africa,3d8qau,ZangiefQueef,2,Tue Jul 14 17:52:02 2015 UTC,"But the east is no better.  I heard a great podcast (Intelligence Squared) discussing ""should we be worried about China in Africa"" and in the end I was convinced not.  What stood out for me what that our leaders (in Africa) determine what we do with that investment and terms of the investment.  Now there is a fine balancing act to be achieved here so you court the investment without doing your people in but we are really terrible at it.  Our leaders don't demand transparency. We cannot hold the west or the east to that, but we can our own leaders.  I believe that until we make that shift in demand of OUR African leaders this will not get any better."
Africa,3d8qau,NoNameMonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:06:06 2015 UTC,"The Chinese are playing on a whole other level, because they don't hide anything. Most of the major infrastructure deals have the kickbacks to shady 'consultancy firms' headed by the cronies of politicians in cold hard writing. And because the money is right there for the taking for the elites, they don't have time to mess around with the Europeans and Americans who make things much too complicated for them to get their money and leave the Country with completely lopsided deals that put all the power in the hands of the multinationals.   I totally agree with you. But the level of civic education in Africa is horrible. The average person in rural areas has no idea about what rights they are entitled to and how to exercise their rights. In Kenya, we read every single day about corruption scandals involving the highest levels of office. But the majority of people, to be perfectly honest, have always accepted that exploitation is the name of the game. Paying a bribe is the difference between getting a hospital bed for your sick child or not, getting your smallholder farm crop sold or not etc. This is why we need more transparency, and more people who are better able to translate economics for the common folk into things that they can understand. At the moment there is one initiative looking at whether people in the press even understand the national and sub-national budgeting process, because otherwise, how can they responsibly give people the information they need to hold their leaders to account?"
Africa,3d8qau,ZangiefQueef,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:17:42 2015 UTC,"I am not certain that transparency alone is going to fix this.  (Looking at my own country and its issues - South Africa with our arms deal, world cup and now a nuclear deal with Russia)  The real problem may be that there is no respect for the democratic systems - the fact that losers must concede defeat and hand power over to rivals.  We have seen the rise (and often championed by my own government) of shared power deals whenever someone loses power.  This means that there are no real consequences for losers.  This means that voters have no real power.  This means that democracy doesn't work.  And most importantly, it always gives rise to radical grabs at power because democracy has no legitimacy in the eyes of Africans.  So they insist on looking for African Solutions around this problem."
Africa,3d8qau,NoNameMonkey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:47:25 2015 UTC,"Once again, very true. I focus on transparency as the right way to start addressing the situation, but in my heart, i am secretly waiting for the youth bulge to finally lash out against the shadow state.  Both South Africa and Kenya are suffering from an incredible number of young people who have been chronically unemployed. This really is a ticking time bomb, as eventually even the informal service sectors where they find work will reach capacity. This is one of the underlying factors of the xenophobic attacks that happened earlier on this year. In the end populist movements may understand that their power lies not in leasing themselves out to the politician of the day, but in actually challenging the state as a whole. It will be violent and bloody, but quite frankly it is inevitable the way things are going with the widening inequality gap and the booming youth population who are wallowing in hopelessness and despair."

Hopefully the big Somalian diaspora will move back to Somalia and give the country the ""brain gain"" it needs.  Secondly school shall be mandatory and free just like Sweden. An educated people is a strong population. A big obstacle in achieving this is the tribal nature in Somalia with all its clans. It took Japan over 20 years to eradicate the patronage system.

Africa,3camfw,mrs_coach,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:24:41 2015 UTC,"I intend to settle here and would enjoy the relative freedom of movement such a document would bestow. Ouagadougou is as good a base camp as any.  I'm really afraid I can't help anyone with getting American citizenship. The people that handle that sort of thing over there are much stricter about whether a marriage is ""legitimate"" or not. We would really have to go all out in making ourselves out to be a convincing couple, requiring time and energy I simply don't possess.  On the other hand, I'm sure the authorities in Burkina Faso couldn't care less so long as someone is bringing capital to their country. I'm already compensating any Burkinabé who helps me with more than the average yearly wage in the country, and the work won't even be very substantial on their part (as I'll be doing most of the legal work myself). They simply have to pretend to be my wife.  If you know about a million West Africans up for the gig, why not help a few my way? :)"
Africa,3camfw,mrs_coach,4,Mon Jul 6 13:47:57 2015 UTC,"Since you don't seem to care about getting citizenship the legal way, why not just make some connections and get a Burkinabé passport using bribery, rather than making up a whole fake marriage.

I really would. If I find a parter in crime like that, then that's really great.  But it's not so realistic. Someone of that sort that would have the means to help me like that is either already in the U.S. or at the very least in France, most likely. It's more realistic (and not to mention much faster) for me to just pay a local a fair price for a short marriage and a shorter divorce, you know?

Africa,3camfw,technosaur,-6,Mon Jul 6 14:10:13 2015 UTC,"Save it with that nonsense on 'exploitation.' Exploitation on whose part, exactly? Surely not on the part of whoever I find to help me. I consider that a very serious charge and don't greatly care to be told by someone with so loose a definition of the word about what makes them 'uncomfortable.'   I intend to enter into a deal where both parties know exactly what they're getting and where both parties are engaging in a fair trade. I'm not going to pay some impoverished soul $50 and some bread crumbs for this, if that's what you expect of me.  My motivations are my own business, but ultimately local citizenship would greatly increase the ease of doing business in the region and that's that."
Africa,3camfw,Joonicks,8,Mon Jul 6 14:43:08 2015 UTC,"Look, you are intending on commiting fraud to obtain citizenship to increase your business functions in a foreign country.  you clearly say that following current laws as an expat would not be as beneficial to you.  Why do you think those current tax laws exist?  I've obviously hit a nerve and I don't want to judge someone on their intentions without knowing them, hence why I asked the questions.  If I get told it's none of my business I'll tell you what this looks like to me and you'll have to accept that others will view it in a similar fashion."
Africa,3camfw,PlatinXP,2,Mon Jul 6 14:51:29 2015 UTC,"There's nothing to do with taxes, actually. As an American, I am required to pay taxes to the U.S. government anyway, regardless of my current country of residency, and I don't intend to give up my American passport for a Burkinabé one.   A local passport is simply the only way to avoid corruption between border-crossings. Consider the cumulative cost of paying for visas upon arrival at a poorly paid border guard's discretion, or simply having the freedom of movement within the ECOWAS zone to begin with. This is a problem I've encountered already that prevents me from doing my limited business in the region, let alone to go through with any of my other plans.  But you would not believe how many times any white man in Africa who's there to make a buck has to deal with that ""exploitation"" shit, as if I'm the wing of some colonial power siphoning off their resources. So of course you hit a nerve, I have to hear that shit 10 times a day from people who've never even left their state, let alone their country."

Africa,3bsczm,alaskady,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:28:32 2015 UTC,"I have three questions. I know very little about (modern) Somalia, my knowledge and perspective is based solely on Western news reporting. This means I only hear about anarchy, Al-Shabaab, and poverty.   Question 1: How widespread is the 'anarchy'? Who do you pay taxes to, who organises education?   Question 2: What are the prospects like for the youth? Is it possible to get higher education, or do young adults move to Kenya or other countries to get more education?    Question 3: Do you think that better times are coming for Somalia? How many more years of instability will there be, and whho has the power to break through this? More specifically, do you trust the African Union to be able to bring stability?  I would be interested to hear your answers!"
Africa,3bsczm,headshotcatcher,2,Wed Jul 1 23:26:41 2015 UTC,"As always what media spreads is somewhat exaggeration, but the truth is there was anarchy in 2 decades there in Somalia, and Al-shabaab contributed to the anarchy, but the poverty one is somwhow true, most Somalis are nomadic and we used to freely move to another area when seasonal rain gets dry, but most of the Somali regions are now controlled by one tribe, and that stopped the movement, and most of the Somalis depend on agriculture and livestock, without functioning government for more than 2 decades and no proper irrigation, our agriculture depends on rain. As for your questions. 1. Since 2011 the anarchy declined because of the government improving on many fronts Al-shabaab have been defeated from many urban areas and are now controlling few countryside areas, that decreased most of the anarchy, and about taxes we never paid any taxes for 25 years but now the government started taking less than 0.5$ daily from business shops that are in the big markets but even this only happens in the capital where most of the businesses are there, but we have states that are part of Somalia, such as Puntland, Jubbaland, and Somaliland, that do have their own taxes, but the at this moment they don't share with the central government, the central government's budget is less than 200M $ and a major bulk of it comes from international donors and the other bulk comes from the Airport and the Seaport of Mogadishu, As for education the last 2 and half decades the education system was not same in the entire country, there were private schools and universities that were teaching which ever curriculum they wanted, but 2015 was the first time the government established a countrywide examination for the primary and the high school and is now drafting the curriculum of the Somali education. 2. The youth there have no tangible prospect at moment, to my surprise I found out that most you in Somalia are holding mostly double Masters, and Bachelor degrees, because of the lack of job opportunity, usually the young people just go to a collage and pursue new degree, I don't think many people go to Kenya for higher education, but so many Somalis go and study in India, Malaysia, China, and other countries. 3. Yes I see better times are coming to Somalia, I don't think there is the same instability that was there but the instability is now political, people are feeling more peace now than before, most Somali diaspora are coming back to the country and investing in, some are bringing their expertise, now there is general instability in peace wise, the only people who I think have the power to break are  the leaders, and they can only break it when they put tribal interest behind national interest, the African union or AMISOM have helped the Somali National Army rebel Alshabaab from the major cities and their help has improved and took major part of the stability, however we the Somali people think, the pace that AMISOM is doing things is quite slow and that makes us think the African Union itself may have another motive.

One of the problems is that many leaders of newly independent states (not just in Africa) build very nepotistic power bases within the institutions of state, often along ethnic lines, and then those people stand to lose their jobs if the big man steps down, so work to keep him in power. It is also very difficult for the sitting president to imagine being able to walk away without being either killed or tried for some kind of crime so they stay put. In mature democracies there is a role for political ""grandees"" who typically take a few years away from the limelight and then are allowed to have opinions but no/little power, and a comfortable life and this path needs to be available for leaders in newer states."

A critical first step to tackling sexual abuse in prison is to foster understanding of the issue by challenging dismissive and ridiculing public attitudes towards prisoner rape, and building social and political recognition of prisoner rape as the devastatingly violent crime it is.  In 2013, the South African Department of Correctional Services adopted the Policy to Address the Sexual Abuse of Inmates In DCS facilities, which tackles the problem in similar ways to the Prison Rape Elimination Act in the U.S. This was an historic and important step towards ending prisoner rape in South Africa, but the main work - its implementation - lies ahead.

My whole education until now has been done here. However, after all these years, some people still hate Chinese (or people who look like them i.e. the descendants). The verbal violence and racism towards us can't be described. I won't deny that I feel terribly lost about my identity. I was bullied and mocked upon my whole life for my skin colour up to the point that I don't want to go out anymore or to talk to anyone.

Are there many families who have lived there as long as your family?    Yes, lots of Chinese citizens escaped war and some came beforehand (~1920) because they sensed that it was coming. At that time, they just took the boat and landed wherever it brought them to. My granddad's cousins landed in Indonesia and some in RSA. Around 1960, we were approx. 50 000 sinos. Now, we're approx. 15 000. In ten years. there'll only be 5000.    Has the racism gotten worse in recent years?    Yes, it has. When my parents were kids, they never faced any racism (They didn't even know the word existed lol). With years, it changed. The sinos here enriched themselves doing business (~1980) and people started to hate the community. At high school, there were jokes about Chinese people. I never bothered about them. At university, it became worse. Some told me to go back where I came from. I was born here so I don't know where to go.   What makes the community leave now if it has been there since the 40s already?    The hatred towards the community mainly, the education and the quality of life. It's difficult to work here e.g. everything will be done for a sino not to progress in the public sector unless you work for your own. Edit: Or a private company.   What do you do on your free time?    I watch TV shows and read.    Do you hang out with black Africans or Chinese Africans or Chinese Chinese or what?   I never had Chinese Chinese friends. When I was a kid, I had a lot of Sino-African friends. Most of them left the country. Entire families of 4-5 kids. I had many friends from other communities too - blacks, muslims, hindus. I shared a lot with them. Some of them were incredibly mean though. They became hurtful as soon as we were close enough (Again comments on how the sinos is stealing everything from them - apparently we are evil :/ - WTF ?). Those comments affected me a lot. I stopped university due to heavy bullying. I withdrew myself from social life and cut-off contacts. My life now is quite empty.   My ancestors never took the country's land.

Africa,388ofi,YaDunGoofed,2,Wed Jun 3 13:21:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I am unable to post photos. My water comes from a well. It has been tested and approved for human consumption. It does have a high mineral content, which over time can cause problems with plumbing (both mechanical and human). I devised a filtration system (credit to many online sources) intended to reduce the mineral content.  It is a simple system. An electric submersible pump lifts water from a well to a ladder-like structure. On top is a plastic bucket (tight sealable lid) with a cotton cloth liner (imagine a pillow case) that serves as a frequently and easily changed trash catcher. A tube from the bottom of that bucket allows gravity flow into a 2nd bucket with another cloth liner filled with sand. That gravity flows to the same setup but with woodchips. That gravity flows to the same setup with charcoal (actually biochar, which is softer, more porous and a better filter than hard charcoal). That flows into a 1,000 liter cistern for general household use.  About 18 months ago, after reading about this MIT DIY xylem filter I began additional filtering of cistern water that is to be used for drinking, cooking, brushing teeth.  It is not typical. Most neighbors use no filtering for well water. Those who take their water from ponds or a flowing stream simply allow the suspended solids to settle and then strain it thru cloth. That is used for washing. Before drinking it or using it for cooking, most boil it.  I am in rural East Africa."

That is, your name doesn’t come to symbolize the living incarnation of evil. Your name and your picture don’t produce fear, hatred, and sorrow. Your victims aren’t talked about and your name isn’t remembered.   But parts of the article are very problematic, especially:   When we learn about Africa, we learn [..] about the HIV epidemic (but never its causes), [..]   Hinting at the ""Aids Conspiracy""?   Nor do we learn about what the United States has done in Iraq and Afghanistan, potentially killing in upwards of 5-7 million people from bombs, sanctions, disease and starvation.   Absurdly high number of casualties in Iraq / Afghanistan, to be solely attributed to the US. Stating such controversial numbers will only help people to ignore the important parts of the article and allow easy derailing.   Making overtly racist remarks is (sometimes) frowned upon in polite society, but it’s quite fine not to talk about genocides in Africa perpetrated by European capitalist monarchs. [..] And since it isn’t talked about, what capitalism did to Africa, all the privileges that rich white people gained from the Congolese genocide are hidden.   Attributing colonialism and genocide to ""capitalism"" ignores that both were also committed by anti-capitalist ideologies.

Attributing colonialism and genocide to ""capitalism"" ignores that both were also committed by anti-capitalist ideologies. It is counter-productive to the understanding of colonialism, racism and genocide to only look at instances which can be attributed to ""capitalism"".   I think you're deliberately confusing the two. Capitalism was what drove colonialism in the scramble for Africa. The British came close to treating their colonies as equals, but the others certainly did not. They were resource grabs. The genocide in the belgian congo would not have occurred had the demand for rubber not played out the way it did. If it hadn't been left unchecked the same fate (although on a lesser scale) would not have met the South American natives.

There's nothing wrong with this, per se, but your using it among out-groups is a form of etymological subterfuge. Whether it is being done consciously or not, Marx and various leftist thinkers have explicitly advocated managing the representational functions of language. And why not? It's damn effective. When you see a conservative pundit calling Obama ""communist,"" they are doing the same exact thing.  You recognize capitalism as the international economic system under which this atrocity occurred. To others, it is vertfrei, the private ownership of the means of production.

Africa,37y1cv,expert02,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:39:23 2015 UTC,"Lake Chad replenishment project:       The Lake Chad replenishment project is a proposed major water diversion scheme that would involve damming the Ubangi River at Palambo in Central African Republic and channeling some of the water to Lake Chad through a navigable canal.   The Transaqua Canal was suggested by a Nigerian engineer before 1991, and would generate hydro-electricity at several points along its length. These would power new industrial townships, while the canal would replenish the lake.  The irrigation scheme for a 2,400 canal from the Congo Basin to the lake, which has been steadily shrinking, was considered unlikely to materialize as late as 2005.   The members of the Lake Chad Basin International Commission are Chad, the Central African Republic, Nigeria, Cameroon and Niger. Concerned by shrinkage of the lake's area from 20,000 square kilometres (7,700 sq mi) in 1972 to 2,000 square kilometres (770 sq mi) in 2002, they met in January 2002 to discuss the project. Both the ADB and the Islamic Development Bank expressed interest in the project. However, the member states of the Congo-Ubangi-Sangha Basin International Commission, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Congo Republic and the Central African Republic expressed concern that the project would reduce the energy potential of the Inga hydroelectric dam, would affect navigation on the Ubangi and Congo rivers and would reduce fish catches on these rivers.

Africa,37fkbn,Izno85,2,Wed May 27 06:59:36 2015 UTC,"Certainly there is racism in the UK.  Frankie Boyle and his guest conflate various subjects and link together disparate historical facts to create a grand story, which isn't likely to explain racism in the UK, nor help us minimise it.  People express racist views and act in biased ways for different reasons and racism in the UK is certainly not exclusive to white British people - one of the facts that undermines the explanations given in this programme."

Africa,37fkbn,doeboy73,3,Wed May 27 13:27:13 2015 UTC,"I've often witnessed racism in London from ethnic minorities aimed at other minority groups and at white people.  I've also witnessed racism aimed at a girlfriend of mine by someone of her own race, because she was going out with me,  a white man.  The worst racism I have seen was in Brixton, which has a large black African population, aimed at Indian men, working in local shops.  I've seen nasty inter-religious hatred and hatred from religious people aimed at minority groups.  The issue is tribalism. No one is immune. It's important for all of us to be aware of the errors in thinking that we are all capable of."

For example, the extraction of natural resources. For Africa to truly develop, she will need to begin processing raw materials and exporting the end result. This is where true profits lie.  Also, Africa really needs to be concerned about sustainability. China can give money and build roads, but at what point will African governments begin to build more of their own infrastructure and figure out how to raise revenue without foreign aid? When China has no use for a country anymore (no resources, no profits in acquiring those resources), will the gains made with Chinese help remain?"

Africa,35x7fo,weeble42,3,Thu May 14 09:32:57 2015 UTC,"In particular, banks, finding hotels/bnb accommodation, costs, travel access?   Banks are easy.  There's ATMs scattered all over the place.  Less though in the smaller towns.  Make sure you grab enough cash to cover basic expenses when you're in the city if you're planning a trip into the bush. Morogoro has a bunch of banks. I find Barclay's most reliable with non-African bank cards.  Hotels... usually not a problem.  Dar es Salaam is easy-peasy.  Morogoro... there's a few lodges around.  There's also some AirBnB places in town and just outside of town.  Costs... vary.  If you're looking for 5 star, you WILL pay 5 star prices.  Generally, you can find decent places for a reasonable price... 10 to 30 Euro per night... ish.  Travel access? Do you mean... ease of travelling? I go by bus.  There's minibuses going every direction you can think of plus a couple you didn't think of. This is Africa... everyone travels by bus :-)   Also where can I pick up sim cards for my phone (iphone) and are their possibilities to buy internet dongles? - since I will be on the move   Prepaid SIM cards are available almost everywhere. You can get talktime/data from vendors on virtually every street-corner and shop/kiosk.  Vodacom is an easy choice... they usually have decent data bundles.  If you really need an internet dongle.. phone shops in the bigger centers should be able to help out there.  I find it easier to just tether my phone when I need internet on my laptop, and do most stuff via the phone.  Internet speeds are pretty decent over 3G/H+ across most of southern Africa.   I have started some Swahili lessons where I live, but I may look for further training when I arrive. Any advice on this?   Some basic Swahili is helpful, but... most people speak English in TZ.  Not all though, and the farther you get outside the larger centers (into the more remote small villages), the more likely you will run into people who don't speak any English at all.  It's usually not a problem though.  Everyone loves a visitor, and there's always someone around who speaks English.  They will magically materialize in the oddest of places."
Africa,35x7fo,weeble42,3,Thu May 14 10:30:44 2015 UTC,Another question regarding accommodation. Would you recommend organising and booking this well in advance or is it possible to find a place when you arrive?
Africa,35x7fo,weeble42,3,Thu May 14 10:39:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, one more thing.  I'd HIGHLY recommend you pick up a 10,000mAh or larger power bank before you leave.  You can get 20,000 or even 50,000 mAh (or bigger, but they get pricey) on Amazon or your local MediaMarkt/Saturn etc.  That extra 10,000 mAh of power for your phone will be VERY handy when you're on the road. If you're really stepping out into the bush, think about a small solar charger - the good ones can be expensive, but... depending on your needs, it can be a good idea (I just use the power bank option).  Also pick up a small LED lantern or light. They are cheap on Amazon or your local sporting good shop will have them.  Worst case, pick one up in Dar when you arrive.  It gets VERY dark there at night, and night starts at 18:00. I say LED lantern/light because they are very bright, they last for-freaking-ever on a couple AA batteries, and they don't get hot."
Africa,35x7fo,weeble42,3,Thu May 14 11:14:53 2015 UTC,I actually didn't even consider these things so thanks so much! Definitely will look into both power packs and solar as I could be a few days at a time without somewhere to charge my phone.
Africa,35x7fo,weeble42,2,Thu May 14 12:46:03 2015 UTC,"Ha... I'm got LOADS of tips :-)  I travel too much. Hehe.  Vaccinations.. have you considered that yet?  I'd suggest as a minimum... Diphtheria, Tetanus, Polio (DTP)... Hep A/B, and Yellow Fever.    Also anti-Malaria meds,  Some doctors prescribe Lariam (Mefloquine).  I'd highly recommend you avoid this stuff.  At the very least do your research on it first.  Google Larium toxicity... read... know what that stuff can do to you.  Hint... it can be VERY nasty stuff it you're in the group that reacts to it. I recommend everyone avoid it based on personal experience with what it can do to you - the hallucinations, paranoia, vivid and terrifying nightmares, and psychosis effects were pretty bad, and only kicked in for me about a week into my trip :-(  The choice is yours though.... just be informed on this one.  Malarone is an easy to get anti-malarial with reasonably low side effects - the one I use in high-malaria zones. I find it more cost effective to buy it somewhere in Africa vs in Europe (ie it's a bit pricey in the EU).  Every pharmacy in Africa seems to carry it. You have to take it daily, but it's not too much trouble.  There's another anti-malarial drug combo... Artesunate, Sulfadoxine and Pyrimethamine that is sometimes prescribed.  The combo with Artesunate is supposedly good for reducing the side effects of just Sulfadoxine and Pyrimethamine alone.  I dunno.. never taken it myself.  I only take the anti-malarials when I have to... as in not on every single trip for the entire trip... just for when it's a ""bad"" area for malaria, and the rest of the time I sleep under mosquito netting, and cover up during prime mozzie feeding times."
Africa,35x7fo,lux_ehterna,2,Thu May 14 13:18:22 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you want, and where you want to go. If you're looking for a resort.. booking in advance is a good idea.  If you're just needing a place to stay, you can wing it if you want.  Of course it doesn't hurt to book in advance, but... well how flexible are you :-)  I wing it most of the time.  I've even arrived in a city at 03 in the morning and managed to get an OK place to stay.  It depends on what you are OK with though.  Simple guest houses are almost everywhere.  In the larger cities (Arusha, Dar, etc), there's always something.  Keep in mind that the whole environment you're stepping into is NOTHING at all like what you're  used to in Europe. If you're open minded you will have a great time though :-)  Iv'e been travelling in Africa (from Ethiopia all the way down to South Africa) for over 15 years now.  I even have a second home there now (in Zambia)."

Africa,35t6mt,ekpraatnie,3,Wed May 13 08:29:32 2015 UTC,"Relevant passage:  One of the most poignant reasons that many young people in the rural areas of Rwanda do not attend or drop out of secondary schools is linked to the policies implemented to bring about economic growth in the country. This fact is explained in details by Marc Sommers, an internationally recognized youth expert.  In his research conducted on Rwandan youth published in 2012, Sommers explains that the Rwandan culture stipulates that for the youth to be recognised as adult men and women they ought to be married. In order to marry, a young man has to build a decent house first.  In the Rwandan rural area, such a house has to be roofed with tiles because roof tiles are easy to accumulate and have become the most preferable roofing option rather than expensive iron sheets that do not last long. Additionally, roofing a house with banana leaves is out of the question since it is viewed as a disgrace within the Rwandan society.  Sommers’ study asserts that prior to the Rwanda’s government policy that forbids cutting trees for environment purposes in 2005, roof tiles were cheaper for male youths to procure and thus faster to build a house. This is because roof tiles were hardened by firewood making its supply abundant.  After the policy was introduced, the supply of roof tiles declined while the demand remained high. Subsequently, the price of roof tiles soared and it is now difficult for male youths in the rural areas of Rwanda to build a house.  “The new method employed peat to fire tile ovens is unfamiliar and requires machinery and technical training which in order to secure, permission must be obtained from a national government in the city capital”, reads the research.  The research also points out that the housing policy mandating that all new houses be built in the villages referred as imidugudu affects young people. The policy was introduced among other reasons to manage land efficiently and increase agricultural production in the country. However, it imposes that large standard dimension houses be built, implying that male youths need to procure more roof tiles. However, considering that the price of roof tiles has significantly soared, young men cannot afford to build a large house in the new villages.  Partly due to the aforementioned policies, many young people in the rural areas do not attend or drop out of secondary schools in order to look for work. Young people prefer working rather than studying so they can start earning and saving towards buying enough roof tiles for their houses and marry, subsequently become adults within the Rwandan cultural society. However, finding employment will be another challenge for the Rwanda’s youth to overcome."

Africa,33nbdl,liotier,3,Thu Apr 23 22:33:24 2015 UTC,"It's not quite true. Bantu societies have always been patriarchal, so ""official"" titles of leadership were always held by men. The same preferences were exhibited in property ownership and marriage customs.   However, women had very large parts to play in ceremonial roles, especially coming-of-age rituals. They were certainly active members of society, and in many cases could take on ""male"" identities in cultural practices when possible. This included leadership roles, but culturally they were ""men"". The colonial structures that were enforced were designed to placate and substitute the ""inferior"" cultures in favour of the metropole. In this fashion, it seems women lost their cultural voices, rather than political ones. Of course, these traditions are hard to break, and accordingly some women have risen up, like Joyce Banda in Malawi, but I do think the colonial structure did have an effect."

Africa,32wpcd,oren1976,3,Fri Apr 17 10:05:16 2015 UTC,"I wonder how many hunters would persist if the playing field were more even. Taking the life of such a substantiate creature as an elephant shouldn't come cheaply, anyway."
Africa,32wpcd,summane,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:12:03 2015 UTC,It doesn't. It costs thousands if not tens of thousands and provides local villages and communities with meat/resources they wouldnt otherwise have
Africa,32wpcd,MrTacoMan,3,Fri Apr 17 13:54:32 2015 UTC,Only about 3% of the revenue that comes into big game hunting corporations goes back into the community.
Africa,32wpcd,akkahwoop,-2,Fri Apr 17 23:57:42 2015 UTC,"Awesome and totally unbiased source bro. Also, counting revenue is freshman finance level shit. What about jobs? Food?"
Africa,32wpcd,MrTacoMan,3,Sat Apr 18 00:46:58 2015 UTC,"Calling the source biased doesn't invalidate its conclusions. Rebut the methodology or the data, don't just sling mud.  Jobs comes under revenue. It's actually mentioned in the source:    While  some    camp    management  and maintenance will    provide opportunities   for  local   employment  and income  to  locally owned   businesses, wages,  directors’ drawings,  business travel, etc.    will    almost  entirely    accrue  to  parties far from    hunting areas.      Remuneration    of professional    hunters,    withdrawals by  directors,  business    travel  and profits will    almost  certainly accrue  largely to  international   parties (Booth  2010    p24).   Locals only see a very small amount of the cash that's sunk into trophy hunting.  In terms of food, the local community might have access to the elephant carcass, but trophy hunting isn't really in significant amounts to form a meaningful part of the average local's diet, and is ultimately a pretty inefficient way of feeding people.   A one-time meat windfall alone doesn't justify elephant hunting to a community.   And don't just hand-wave revenue. Point is that the enormous amount of money spent on hunting does not directly benefit the community. They're left with what, a dead elephant? They could have killed the elephant themselves. It's just too risky to really be worth it vs farming cows, goats or chickens for your meat."
Africa,32wpcd,akkahwoop,-2,Sat Apr 18 01:13:56 2015 UTC,The bias of a source unequivocally invalidates it's numbers. Are you an idiot?
Africa,32wpcd,MrTacoMan,3,Sat Apr 18 01:18:34 2015 UTC,"You need to clarify how it is biased, how that might affect the conclusions it posits, and how they have either lied or misrepresented/misinterpreted data to draw a false conclusion.   Just saying 'its a biased source' doesn't constitute an instawin. You need to actually make a counterargument.  You're committing a logical fallacy called Bulverism, and seeing as it's the total content of your response, it fundamentally undermines your point."
Africa,32wpcd,akkahwoop,2,Sat Apr 18 01:21:44 2015 UTC,"The ""cheaply"" was meant metaphorically, a man paid with his life."
Africa,32wpcd,summane,4,Fri Apr 17 14:04:25 2015 UTC,That'll happen. A bull elephant in musth is one of the most dangerous animals in the world. Up there with a hippopotamus or a saltie. I'll rip apart houses and flip cars. I'm genuinely surprised that they apparently elected to approach it when they realised that it was in musth. A lot of experienced bushmen will high-tail it out of there if they even suspect musth.

Africa,32ugva,Pay-Me-No-Mind,4,Fri Apr 17 13:28:05 2015 UTC,"South Africans in poorer regions are scapegoating immigrants, mostly from other African nations, for their economic problems.
