Tinder,3e31mx,sir_brontosaurus,90,Tue Jul 21 16:01:57 2015 UTC,Tinder needs an option where you can filter by:   Looking for just a hookup Looking for something long term Both   This would make it so much easier and straight forward instead of having to guess or waste two peoples time.
Tinder,3e31mx,BoogerSlug,28,Tue Jul 21 17:15:04 2015 UTC,I don't think a lot of girls would openly select the hookup option.
Tinder,3e31mx,PhoiZe,9,Tue Jul 21 19:57:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe a choice between ""casual""/""serious"" instead of hookup/long-term?  What about if you couldn't see which they selected until you matched? Would that help or hinder?"
Tinder,3e31mx,IronyAndWhine,33,Tue Jul 21 20:43:38 2015 UTC,"Or like a section, where you could write something about what you're looking for."
Tinder,3e31mx,spros,9,Tue Jul 21 19:57:28 2015 UTC,nah
Tinder,3e31mx,oneinchterror,0,Tue Jul 21 21:01:40 2015 UTC,"No, no it doesn't. Because some women out there are looking for hookups and the men aren't and vice versa."

Tinder,3e31mx,deejaymikeyg,12,Tue Jul 21 16:49:27 2015 UTC,"He said it in an extremely douchy way. A ""I'm not really looking for a relationship"" would have sufficed. Just because someones morals might be straight in one way doesn't mean they couldn't be skewed in another. I could say that I don't drunk drive, but I could be totally fine kicking babies."

Tinder,3e31mx,ChimpBottle,20,Tue Jul 21 21:31:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah but let's not pretend that tinder is that obvious. This subreddit likes to pretend that tinder is solely a hookup app and that anyone using it for other purposes is doing it wrong, but fact of the matter is that plenty of people use it for dating, rather successfully too. I just don't think it's fair to be rude to somebody who uses it for such."

Tinder,3e2dj7,CJsAviOr,2,Tue Jul 21 13:52:44 2015 UTC,A woman who can actually hold her own when it comes to witty banter is pure gold. Most girls I talk to just seem like they want you to entertain them while they consider if they want to reward you with a lame date.
Tinder,3e2dj7,TheMadWoodcutter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:59 2015 UTC,At least you got girls go talk. Been using this app for a couple of weeks and I got like 10ish matches in total.   They were all bots.
Tinder,3e2dj7,FPMG,-4,Tue Jul 21 19:34:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I go through stretches like that too. Just keep messing around with your profile until you find something that works. 2 things seem to yeild the best results for me: flattering pictures and a humorous bio. Don't bother writing anything serious about yourself, women only consider for a few seconds if you're worth swiping right for and if you don't make an immediate positive impression you're screwed. Best to just go balls out and try to make them laugh."

Tinder,3e1t5y,Clean541,2,Tue Jul 21 08:26:19 2015 UTC,"Try logging into Facebook, going to app setting and unassociating the Tinder app from your Facebook account. This may or may not cause you to lose existing matches. When I did it, I didn't already have any matches, so I'm not sure, but I did notice that I saw people during swiping afterwards that I had previously seen, so it did seem to reset things.  After that, I was able to just proceed with opening the Tinder app on my phone, logging in, and continuing as normal. For the best Tindering experience, I recommend that you just proceed with giving Tinder access to everything it requests. Giving it access to your Facebook friends and Facebook likes will allow it to show potential matches that you two have something in common."

Tinder,3dz8ru,99639,16,Mon Jul 20 19:59:35 2015 UTC,Most guys will probably interpret it to mean that you're looking for someone taller than yourself.  Is that the case?
Tinder,3dz8ru,SpyderBite36,12,Mon Jul 20 19:32:36 2015 UTC,"No that's not. If someone is able to handle my height, even if he is shorter, it does not matter. It's just that some guys don't like to be the smaller one."
Tinder,3dz8ru,tknames,7,Mon Jul 20 20:04:46 2015 UTC,"I would swipe left unless you stipulated that. Not because I wouldn't want to date you but when girls list that, it's implied they're looking for someone as tall or taller."
Tinder,3dz8ru,VT-Sensational,6,Mon Jul 20 23:30:55 2015 UTC,"I would not list it and I might even include something saying height doesn't matter to you, because most guys will assume that tall women won't accept shorter men.  I've never met a shorter guy that wouldn't date a taller woman, but almost every short guy I know avoids tall women because most tall women respond negatively to short guys.  If you are the exception here then you should let guys know because right now most short guys are probably avoiding you based on this assumption."

I fee like you're tall enough that it won't necessarily be interpreted that you need someone taller. When girls put 5'7 then i assume it's because they want to make sure guys are taller, but with 6' it's like hey just so you know, I may be taller than you."

Tinder,3dutfv,EpiNerd,3,Mon Jul 20 03:55:16 2015 UTC,"I think you're out slightly, 20-23 year olds..."
Tinder,3dutfv,chrisd93,2,Mon Jul 20 04:26:55 2015 UTC,"15-25 year olds, tones of my friends of all ages play"
Tinder,3dutfv,Gartles-eth,0,Mon Jul 20 19:19:46 2015 UTC,I'm around her age and guarantee I know more about pokemon than you
Tinder,3dutfv,mileylols,2,Mon Jul 20 06:45:21 2015 UTC,slow clap
Tinder,3dutfv,livemau5,2,Mon Jul 20 15:22:10 2015 UTC,Thanks fam
Tinder,3dutfv,522DTO,22,Mon Jul 20 15:28:57 2015 UTC,"I laughed, it was very clever."
Tinder,3dutfv,livemau5,7,Sun Jul 19 20:10:34 2015 UTC,75 comments and no one has mentioned OP's glaringly obvious grammar error in the title?   You disappoint me reddit.
Tinder,3dutfv,Chrisgomez182,7,Mon Jul 20 03:37:03 2015 UTC,Shhh that was a good thing
Tinder,3dutfv,Epitometric,4,Mon Jul 20 03:38:06 2015 UTC,to be honest it's one of those things where your mind just automatically fixes the the error
Tinder,3dutfv,megalurkeruygcxrtgbn,3,Mon Jul 20 12:38:46 2015 UTC,I would have gone with my super rod.
Tinder,3dutfv,Chrisgomez182,5,Mon Jul 20 01:21:12 2015 UTC,"Should have gone with ""You're not wearing shorts! What's wrong with you?"""
Tinder,3dutfv,blinklpofadown,17,Sun Jul 19 23:19:49 2015 UTC,"Good God, man, get rid of that crappy stock keyboard. Switch to SwiftKey or something."
Tinder,3dutfv,Chrisgomez182,13,Sun Jul 19 19:59:40 2015 UTC,Why is swift key better? (Pardon my ignorance)
Tinder,3dutfv,LochnessDigital,8,Sun Jul 19 21:29:13 2015 UTC,"One Word: Autocorrect  You can easily type quickly without worrying about hitting keys accurately. Once you get the hang of it (and give it some time to get used to your typing style), you don't even need to look at the keyboard."
Tinder,3dutfv,livemau5,12,Sun Jul 19 21:33:01 2015 UTC,I use the default keyboard all the time and I can basically misspell a shitload of stuff and my phone will still autocorrect it. I misspelled a ton of things typing this comment and it helped me out.
Tinder,3dutfv,LochnessDigital,4,Sun Jul 19 22:36:19 2015 UTC,"SwiftKey sees where your fingers land when you are trying to press a certain letter, and changes the hit box of each letter accordingly to match where your fingers land when you try to type that letter. So beyond the best autocorrect in the business, yea it's good."
Tinder,3dutfv,duelingdelbene,3,Mon Jul 20 03:12:26 2015 UTC,I don't use autocorrect at all and I hate pretty much any predictive text keyboard on a phone. I really don't like my words moving and changing about when I don't need help.
Tinder,3dutfv,PM_ME_YOUR_NUD3Z,7,Mon Jul 20 01:52:17 2015 UTC,well I'm the opposite so does that mean we have to fight?
Tinder,3dutfv,Constant-Change,3,Mon Jul 20 02:28:50 2015 UTC,Yes sir.
Tinder,3dutfv,TheTripleH,5,Mon Jul 20 03:08:54 2015 UTC,Meet in the middle of the country. We fight with only tree branches so choose wisely.
Tinder,3dutfv,freakwastaken,6,Mon Jul 20 03:19:28 2015 UTC,"Swiftkey fucks up so much worse for me. If you're sloppy at typing, it'll predict all kinds of shit you didn't mean to say."
Tinder,3dutfv,Ashewolf,3,Sun Jul 19 22:42:00 2015 UTC,How long did you use it for? You need to give it at least a month to catch on. I've been using it for three years now and in my experience it's 99% accurate.
Tinder,3dutfv,KSUpsych,2,Sun Jul 19 22:56:30 2015 UTC,"I've had it on for the entirety of my HTC one m8s life, so a year and a half so far."
Tinder,3dutfv,dtrmp4,6,Mon Jul 20 00:22:58 2015 UTC,"It's not. OPs keyboard is fine, I use the same one. Plus it has the tap autocorrect with three suggestions which is much better than it changing every word on you. At least that was my experience."
Tinder,3dutfv,KSUpsych,2,Sun Jul 19 21:59:47 2015 UTC,Matt became burned.
Tinder,3dutfv,kylestephens54,2,Mon Jul 20 03:22:15 2015 UTC,"Next time follow up with ""Brianna is confused. Matt used number drain."""
Tinder,3dutfv,blondedre3000,2,Mon Jul 20 04:52:42 2015 UTC,You two hit it off well? :O
Tinder,3dzbrw,Lanetrain747,4,Mon Jul 20 19:23:51 2015 UTC,I like her.
Tinder,3dzbrw,Capetorial,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:57:49 2015 UTC,She must be queer
