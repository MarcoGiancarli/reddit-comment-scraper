Anyway I really admire Bob Errey as an announcer.  He isn't afraid to talk about random interesting stuff mildly related to the game.   That's my kind of announcer.   I don't like announcers who get boring and predictable.   Even Steiggy likes to lean into color commentary.   If I'm with old friends, and we're not talking much, the stuff Bob talks about always eventually gets us start talking about stuff too.  He's like a conversation starter."

penguins,3e5100,phuckfilly,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:31:17 2015 UTC,The goal at ~1:33
penguins,3e1859,PhantomJB93,31,Tue Jul 21 04:21:35 2015 UTC,"Especially telling considering it includes Malkin going without any point in the 14-15 playoffs, and Crosby not scoring a lot of goals in the 13-14 playoffs.  When Toews only scores 1 goal in the first 20 playoff games in a season, the Blackhawks win the Cup. Kane wasn't much more productive then.  Injuries, depth, goaltending, defense, management... pick your poison. But the people who blame Crosby and Malkin the most are pretty ignorant."
penguins,3e1859,kikkerlaika,4,Tue Jul 21 06:18:46 2015 UTC,And this doesn't include the 2 years in a row in the SCF just prior to them collecting these stats why?
penguins,3e1859,forbidin1986,21,Tue Jul 21 05:01:50 2015 UTC,I think the sample size was chosen to show that Crosby and Malkin have still been effective players over the time period they have been criticized for playoff failures while Toews and Kane had success.  Obviously nobody disputes they were effective when we won.
penguins,3e1859,forbidin1986,3,Tue Jul 21 05:03:44 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, was just confused by the timeframe chosen. Literally one year after the cup win. Makes sense though."
penguins,3e1859,AT-ST,9,Tue Jul 21 05:10:18 2015 UTC,"I think the main point of the chart was to show how important the supporting cast was to Chicago.  Everyone is quick to say that Sid and Geno can't perform in the Playoffs, yet their individual stats are better than Toews and Kane, or at least close enough that it doesn't matter.  So the real difference is the players around them."
penguins,3e1859,forbidin1986,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:16:29 2015 UTC,"Ya I get the point it's trying to make, maybe it's my beer altered mind but I'd honestly like to know who, or how, the 2009 Pens had a better supporting cast than say, 2013. I remember watching the cup run and only Talbot, besides the stars, really sticks out in my memory."
penguins,3e1859,AT-ST,7,Tue Jul 21 05:22:49 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the 2009 team was a better supporting cast individually, but as a team they were better.  To me the 2013 team was like when a chef over seasons their meal.  A few of those additions would have been good, but too many is what caused the failure.  Plus one of the major additions, Iginlia, was used wrong.  Add onto that, the 2013 Bruins were a solid team in their own right as well."
penguins,3e1859,forbidin1986,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:34:38 2015 UTC,Completely agree. Like I said beer's kicked in a little. Also I forgot about Jordan Staal and how important he was for us that run. Great metaphor btw.
penguins,3e1859,rsh412,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:37:25 2015 UTC,"The fourth line in 2009 had guys like Miroslav Satan, Ruslan Fedotenko, Max Talbot and a very effective Craig Adams rotating through it. Kris Letang was a third-pairing defender that year. They haven't even come close to that type of depth since then. This year they finally have a chance with the young players moving up to have real, effective, Cup-caliber depth again."
penguins,3e1859,jpmad,3,Tue Jul 21 21:58:13 2015 UTC,"Looks like the issues are in the surrounding players, but we all know that by now. Chicago is and excellently put together team, and winning multiple Cups only helps their situation."
penguins,3e1859,Xstasy14,6,Tue Jul 21 05:02:47 2015 UTC,It's so frustrating seeing the Consol curse. To just have half a season (preferably including the playoffs) with a full healthy roster...just to see if we really could do some damage. It's hard for the front office to really see what has to be adjusted when we never have a full team.
penguins,3e1859,mcgillycuddy412,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:55:15 2015 UTC,Was an excellently put together team. They're definitely no longer the same team anymore.
penguins,3e1859,ThisIsTheBlack,5,Tue Jul 21 14:06:55 2015 UTC,"A lot of people have been saying this, and it's true.  Crosby and Malkin getting blamed is pointing the finger at the wrong things.  They have had a speckle of the help that Toews and Kane have had.  Put Sid and Geno on the Blackhawks and you're looking at both of them putting up 35 points in the playoffs yearly."
penguins,3e1859,MeMe_TanMan,3,Tue Jul 21 12:05:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's always my argument when people gripe on Crosby/Malkin and Praise Toews/Kane. If you switched those players, but kept the teams otherwise the same, do you think the Pens would have 3 cups? Usually it's a no, but if they say yes I know they're dumb and stop talking to them."
penguins,3e1859,MumpsyDaisy,4,Tue Jul 21 12:54:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah but how clutch were their goals, what about their +/- or faceoff percentages, and how many goals did Sid's leadership inspire his team mates to score?"

penguins,3dzz86,ArmedSnobbery,4,Mon Jul 20 23:00:17 2015 UTC,"I have the same fake jersey. The blade is indeed angled, and I think my numbers are slightly off the mark (in my case they are slightly too close), but you have to figure if it's $30 you understand what you are paying for. I personally like it, and I didn't want to shell out another 150+ dollars so soon."

penguins,3dzz86,Velirno,-26,Tue Jul 21 00:27:58 2015 UTC,"I don't blame you for not having the extra money to spend right now. But what Penguins games are you wearing this to right now? Maybe by the time the season starts you might have saved some up? And wouldn't it feel better having a legitimate jersey?   I think the main problem I have with fakes, and I'll go ahead and ask you, is ""Why?"" Like, what legitimate reason is there to throw away your money to some Chinese sweatshop owner for something some random person threw together? Are you trying to show people you love the Pens? Do you just love the idea of owning a jersey? Do you want to use it to play in? I just don't understand people's justification other than ""Reebok rips people off and I don't want to spend that money."" Which, to me, isn't an excuse. It's just an explanation of why someone is a cheapskate. ""Something costs X but I think it should cost less so I will either steal it or get a pretend version."" What is the reasoning for throwing money away for an inferior and cheap looking product that only hurts the team and league you claim to support by wearing said product?"
penguins,3dzz86,ArmedSnobbery,14,Tue Jul 21 00:43:10 2015 UTC,Honestly the quality of the Reebok jerseys are pretty terrible unless you pay out the ass for the authentic jerseys.
penguins,3dzz86,newbo750,5,Tue Jul 21 02:31:47 2015 UTC,I agree. Even the premier jersey I got from coolhockey isn't the best quality in my opinion. Some of the stitching on the numbers is comes out a little and the heat pressed crest is a turn off. Especially when you through it in the wash and it gets bent up.  I'd only shell out cash for the authentic jerseys if had the money for them. They're kinda nice to wear if you're a hardcore fan who wants to wear exactly what the pros wear or if you want a cool jersey for pickup hockey. But for something that expensive why would you want to play hockey in it?
penguins,3dzz86,pugfart,6,Tue Jul 21 04:17:56 2015 UTC,My main reason is that I want to be able to wear it without having a small heart attack when something gets on it.  I have a legit jersey that I wore to two games and I was constantly nervous about blemishing it somehow (I got it signed then put it away soon after).  At least for 30 bucks I'm not going feel like I threw money away if something happens to it.
penguins,3dzz86,StoutSystematic,2,Tue Jul 21 00:49:02 2015 UTC,"It's more of something to wear out to bars and things like that for the time being, once I have a job and will be able to attend games I'll be more in the position to buy a real jersey, and probably will. Honestly on this one the blade is too angled for me to accept, that would bug the hell out of me, along with the bad alignment on the back. If there was a better looking knockoff I wouldn't really feel bad about picking one up."
penguins,3dzz86,StoutSystematic,5,Tue Jul 21 01:11:26 2015 UTC,"I've actually contacted the seller about the mistake in the crest. Some of the jerseys don't have this stick blade problem, in fact the pittsburgh gold jersey they advertised doesn't have the stick tilt, yet the other two jerseys they are advertising do. I think they might not even know there is a difference. I've notified them, I'll let you know what they have to say about it.  EDIT:   So the seller responded to me, but I'm sure something is lost in translation. They said they appreciate the feedback and gave me a discount on another jersey, that combined with a coupon I just got from them for $5 off, my next jersey is $15. Like honestly, I just don't care at that price, good for home use or a bar."
penguins,3dzz86,theold_man,5,Tue Jul 21 01:41:36 2015 UTC,It's not though. I respectfully disagree. I have an official malkin that is beautiful but also cost me close to $200. Ever since then all I buy are the knock offs because I am usually spilling beer on it anyways.

When low income decreases the salary cap next season and they can't afford Kessel anymore, don't worry, the irony will be completely lost on me.""  Every time someone submits their pictures of fake jerseys, especially when they do comparisons with real ones, I picture them as the guys standing outside of Heinz Field selling knockoff shit.

penguins,3dzz86,dmack4,6,Tue Jul 21 03:44:44 2015 UTC,"I'm such a big Penguins fan I go out of my way to undercut their revenue!   Except you are vastly over estimating how much money the penguins (or any team) makes on jersey sales. There's these things called licensing contracts where Reebok pays the NHL for the right to produce and manufacture jerseys. Reebok pays a lot of money for this right as it gives them a monopoly of sorts. They're the only ones officially licensed to make jerseys. Most of the money from jersey sales goes into Reeboks pocket as they need to recoup the cost of the licensing agreement. That's why the jerseys are so fucking expensive. They have a monopoly and need to get that money back so they charge $150 bucks but it doesn't cost them anywhere near that amount to make them. You're kidding yourself if you think the Penguins are making the bulk of the money. They might get a couple dollars for each jersey sale. The NFL only gets about 12% of the WHOLESALE cost of jerseys sold.   It's weird seeing people take pride in enabling copyright infringement.   And maybe if they weren't trying fuck me in the ass with pricing a jersey so high when it cost pennies to produce, I wouldn't have to go elsewhere. That's how a normal market works. Supply and demand. But because Reebok has a legal monopoly on it, they can charge whatever they want. Enter the chinese company who are providing something that many people would rather pay. It's called a free market and you're just blinded by the fact that Reebok has a monopoly and can charge whatever they want because there's no competitors."
penguins,3dzz86,Penguins68668771,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:10:05 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's condescending. I know what a licensing agreement is. I also know the NHL is due for a new one within a year or two, and counterfeit sales drive the price down.  Also, I know what a monopoly is, and I'm pretty sure normal markets allow monopolies to respect intellectual property rights. When someone buys a jersey with a penguin and the word Crosby on it, the Penguins and Crosby should probably make money off it.  Ultimately, the NHLPA is selling players' likenesses (to Reebok for now) and the NHL is selling teams' trademarked images and details. If they're selling for too much, I totally understand, but a counterfeit jersey isn't a cheaper equivalent, it's fraud."
penguins,3dzz86,ilikehockeyandguitar,2,Tue Jul 21 13:42:54 2015 UTC,"I'm such a big Penguins fan I go out of my way to undercut their revenue!   But saying this isn't condescending? Don't open with condescension if you can't handle it coming back. You come into a thread with a holier than thou attitude because you buy an authentic jersey...that's fine if that's what you want to do with your money but others might not have the same inclination as you. If you don't like the knockoff jerseys, keep it to yourself. No one's going around starting shit and calling people idiots because they spent 170 on a jersey, there's no need to rip people for getting a lesser quality item by spending 1/6 of the money that you did.  Here's what you don't understand, if someone's buying a Chinese knockoff of a jersey, maybe they aren't interested in spending money on an authentic one. So the NHL/Penguins aren't losing any money. They aren't getting money they wouldn't have gotten anyways. I only have a jersey because it was 50% and I only had to spend 50 bucks for it. No way in hell I'm buying one for 170. So if I'm not buying one for 170, they aren't getting my money. If I buy one from a Chinese knockoff for 30, they still aren't getting my money. They are a company competing for MY business, not the other way around. If they want my business, they need to make it worth my while. That's how a market works. A customer shouldn't blindly be spending their money to support a company making MILLIONS of dollars, they should be spending their money according to what gives them the best value."

There's no lost potential revenue if the pirate/fake jersey owner was never going to buy the original product. The problem is, it affects people who do have the money for the real thing. I mean, this whole post and especially real/fake comparison posts encourage people to buy Chinese jerseys over American ones. Someone with $170 to spare is going to notice and do that.  I also object to it because I feel like I'm not entitled to a Penguins jersey, and that's the feeling I always get about counterfeiting (""I can't afford the real thing, but I want a jersey, so I should be able to get a fake if I can afford that"" - I'd rather just not get one).

You can spend only $90 more and get an officially licensed jersey that benefits the team that has hand sewn name and numbers by someone who actually cares and has a clue in Canada at Coolhockey right now. It will be up to team specifications and actually have the right logo on it and everything will be tackle twill instead of the bubbly garbage they use on these fakes in China.   If you can't afford that right now, I totally get it. But I don't get throwing away the money you DO have on garbage like this that isn't even shaped the way it's supposed to that has some jacked up logo on the front when you could just save your money and get the real deal by the time the season starts."
penguins,3dzz86,ThisIsTheBlack,15,Tue Jul 21 13:44:41 2015 UTC,"Yep, because clearly the team needs this guy's $120 or whatever it is. Not like they're worth north of $800 Million or anything..."
penguins,3dzz86,Pensfan66595,-16,Tue Jul 21 00:33:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and (insert band name here) is on (next major label here) which is worth (Xmillion dollars). It's not like they need my money so I'll just pirate the album or the movie or whatever it is.   Same bullshit excuse for being cheap and deciding what you think a product is worth."
penguins,3dzz86,Ehvin21,10,Tue Jul 21 01:14:52 2015 UTC,Well if bands sold their CDs for 60 dollars instead of 10 would you buy it or download it?  Cmon man who cares.
penguins,3dzz86,ThePensAreMightier,4,Tue Jul 21 01:23:57 2015 UTC,"But I don't get throwing away the money you DO have   Coming from the guy who says to save up 90 more dollars in order to buy an official jersey which the penguins don't make jack for money on to begin with. Reebok gets the lions share of the money from jersey sales as they've already paid the NHL a shit load of money for the licensing rights. But yeah, you know better!"
penguins,3dzz86,ThisIsTheBlack,7,Tue Jul 21 01:27:53 2015 UTC,"""Only 90"" is a lot to some people."
penguins,3dzz86,Ehvin21,-35,Tue Jul 21 13:45:19 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but this is an embarrassingly bad fake. The crest looks ridiculous, his stick blade is at a 45 degree angle and it's all puffy. It's not even the right cut, it has a straight hem like the old jerseys before Reebok took over. The NHL shield on the neck is laughable, as is the alignment of the name and number on the back, not to mention that they're made out of some shiny bubbly material. Total hack job. I just don't understand why someone would choose to spend their money on something that looks like this when you could just save a little more and get the real thing and also support the team instead of some Chinese drug lord. Oh well. Enjoy."
penguins,3dy778,ExecutiveFingerblast,15,Mon Jul 20 14:34:34 2015 UTC,"How do they have random single seats elsewhere? Doesn't that violate the reason they wouldn't sell to you? They would have had to allow someone else to create ""orphaned"" seats....  I'm sorry, man. This is bad business, plain and simple."
penguins,3dy778,Anrui,10,Mon Jul 20 15:08:31 2015 UTC,"What's curious to me, that if the rule is no single seats then by that extension of logic they shouldn't be able to sell seats in uneven amounts.  Most sections are an even number of seats."
penguins,3dy778,Anrui,11,Mon Jul 20 15:09:20 2015 UTC,"I sent the link to the Penguins twitter account. Hopefully someone reaches out to you and makes this right. I can't believe this policy exists, and it probably exists because they assume if you turn down their shit rules someone else will throw their money at them."
penguins,3dy778,ProfessorSnipe,4,Mon Jul 20 15:22:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is limited to the Penguins, but might be a CEC policy. I tried buying a pair of tickets to a concert last year, and just like you, every section I could afford had 3 seats remaining and wouldn't let me buy just two; yet there were single seats peppered throughout every section.  I opted just to not buy any"

This is almost certainly not a winning proposition for making money. 2) It sounds like this guy and his dad are on a budget and don't have the money to throw at an extra ticket just to have to go out of their way to scalp it at less than face value in order to recover some of their costs."
penguins,3dzp2v,GoodShotTom,4,Mon Jul 20 20:57:49 2015 UTC,"I'm almost positive that site is selling fake jerseys.  If you have no issue with buying a fake, I would search http://www.aliexpress.com/, but I've heard its sort of a mixed bag as far as quality goes.  If you're set on official merchandise, cool hockey (http://www.coolhockey.com/m8/Pittsburgh-Penguins/index.html) is having a big sale on premier jerseys right now.  I just snagged a Kessel from them myself!"
penguins,3dzp2v,karateinthewater,6,Mon Jul 20 21:07:11 2015 UTC,"I just received the jersey I ordered from aliexpress for $30. It was a Pittsburgh Gold Kessel jersey. I can post some pics for those wondering what the quality is like. I can't complain about the tiny things, since it was so cheap.  EDIT:  Here is an album full of pics I took of the jersey. I tried to get close ups of the jersey so that you can see what its made of easier. If you are interested at all, I got the jersey from the link in the description of the album.   If you'd like a side by side comparison with a legit jersey I purchased I could post that (the jersey is a Leaf jersey though).  Additionally, this is a large. I'm 5'10 and weigh about 180. It's pretty snug."

penguins,3dzp2v,phuckfilly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:52:20 2015 UTC,The quality in the fake jerseys may sometimes be worse off than the officially licensed ones (obviously). But they are indeed significantly cheaper. Honestly it's all personal preference.

penguins,3ds6xy,Pensfan2987,15,Sat Jul 18 23:10:54 2015 UTC,"So the white team dominated the game as the 8-1 score would indicate. It seemed to me like that was a result of having a superior defense, and a little more experience from their forwards. Obviously Ty Loney had a day. I was really more impressed with Anton Zlobin's play.   Conor Sheary also looked really great, although it seemed like he was trying to hard to be the play maker rather than the scorer. He passed up at least one really good chance to shoot trying to force a pretty passing play.  The black team had Sprong and Rust on a line together and while both looked great individually, it seemed like there was really no chemistry there. The problem to me seemed like Sprong had a great individual skillset, but he was out of position a lot. I'm not sure if they were trying to see how he played on both wings or if he was just totally on the wrong side of the ice a few times.   I'd like to see the game again so I could get a better feel for what was not working on that line. But my sense was that Rust was playing a better game and Sprong came out terrible nervous in the first half. In any case, I thought Sprong looks like he will almost certainly develop in to an NHL top 6 forward--I thought his skating looked smooth and explosive and his hands and passing were definitely above average as well. He needs at least a year of minor league hockey before he's ready though.  Simon Dominik looked pretty good out there as well, but didn't really seem to set himself apart immensely.   Jaden Lindo looked really solid the whole game. He had a few rushes where he used his speed to go around a defender, but didn't finish. He's played 2 years in the OHL with the Owen Sound posting third line numbers, but looks ready to play at the AHL level for sure. He looked much stronger than any of the defenders he was going up against. I have no problem believing he's 211 pounds of solid muscle.  Milos Bubela was another guy who made his presence known several times offensively. I don't know if he's earned a spot, but I thought he was pretty solid for a 22 year old undrafted Slovakian currently playing at RPI.  Derrick Pouliot looked like an NHLer playing against a bunch of prospects as you would expect. I didn't really think any of the other defensemen who skated showed anything particularly special but Sexton, Segalla, and Murphy all looked like passable AHL players.   That 6'8"" guy that took a picture with Malkin was not terribly impressive although his skating is much better than most people his size.   If Tyler Biggs was playing today, I didn't notice. I'm not trying to be mean-spirited either. I just honestly don't remember him doing anything.  Tristan Jarry had a really rough day but I'm not so quick to make a judgment about him based on what I saw. His team was clearly the weaker team and most of the first half was spent in his end."
penguins,3ds6xy,shelvedtopcheese,4,Sun Jul 19 00:31:29 2015 UTC,Biggs and sundqvist are injured.

penguins,3ds6xy,DriArcher,2,Sun Jul 19 00:53:43 2015 UTC,"I thought Biggs was injured? Other than that, thanks for the analysis!"
penguins,3ds6xy,Sh-tstirrer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:35:07 2015 UTC,I think Murphy played wonderful defense. He was responsible for a few blocked shots and breaking up passed. I was pretty impressed with his play.
penguins,3ds6xy,shelvedtopcheese,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:31:51 2015 UTC,That's true but I thought he also looked flustered once or twice on the puck which led to turnovers. Maybe that was someone else though. I had a little more trouble picking out the D guys at the start of the scrimmage.
penguins,3ds6xy,Sh-tstirrer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:06:35 2015 UTC,It's possible. I was focusing more on Skoff and Pavlychev since they were the 2 Penn State guys. I just remember being impressed by Murphy and him blocking at least 2 shots with his skates (intentional or not).
penguins,3ds6xy,Sh-tstirrer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:10:55 2015 UTC,There's a bunch of comments on the thread with the stream link.
penguins,3ds6xy,mickj0nes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:12:44 2015 UTC,Sprong looked pretty good to me. Made a few really nice feeds that should have been goals. After the Sexton hit he went back at him hard all game. Smacking his wrists and laying out a nice check of his own. His skating and play reminded me of Geno in a way. Other than obviously Pouliot and Rust he stood out as a man among boys. Ty Loney was pretty good too. Walked in on a few and scored the sickest SO goal I've ever seen in person.
