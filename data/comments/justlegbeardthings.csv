Individual legbeard (or neckbeard for that matter) features don't make the whole character. E.g. I used to like girls with neon hair when it wasn't immediately associated with SJWs. Same with feminism, there is nothing wrong with being a feminist per se (however, it is questionable why a sane person would want to associate themselves with the ideology which is so fucked up from inside by psychos. I think it is possible to follow feminist goals without standing under that banner).   I do identify as pansexual   To be honest, it doesn't matter jack shit how one ""identifies"". Only actions matters. I might identify as succubisexual because I would totally bang a demon chick if they existed. But in reality, I'm occasionally straight/most of the time alone.  If you have sex with guys, girls, and transpeople - fine, you are pansexual, but in that case I don't see why would you say the word ""identify"".

justlegbeardthings,36zadc,shrekman123,2,Sun May 24 00:04:53 2015 UTC,"Assassination of William McKinley:       The 25th President of the United States, William McKinley, was shot and fatally wounded on September 6, 1901, inside the Temple of Music on the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. McKinley was shaking hands with the public when he was shot by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist. The President died on September 14 from gangrene caused by the bullet wounds.  McKinley had been elected for a second term in 1900. He enjoyed meeting the public, and was reluctant to accept the security available to his office. The Secretary to the President, George B. Cortelyou, feared an assassination attempt would take place during a visit to the Temple of Music, and twice took it off the schedule. McKinley restored it each time.  Czolgosz had lost his job during the economic Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism, a political philosophy whose adherents had recently killed foreign leaders. Regarding McKinley as a symbol of oppression, Czolgosz felt it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him. Unable to get near McKinley during the earlier part of the presidential visit, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.    Image i     Interesting: First inauguration of Theodore Roosevelt | Pan-American Exposition | George B.

Ideally neither of them would be destroying each others property but that is not how war in the 1930s worked.

Your argument was that anarchism is anachronistic in the 21st century and could achieve nothing.

Everything i read and see and talk to seem to want men to be ashamed of their preferences while maintaining their own. My ex cut her hair short and i never said that she couldnt do it, but i thought she looked better (to my tastes) with long hair. But theres just no room for the opinion of ""go ahead and cut your hair, i just dont like it"", there is no live and let live it seems. i either have to accept it and like it or be a sexist pig who is a part of the problem.  As a side note sometimes short hair looks great on women, but i dont like to see it on most women."
justlegbeardthings,34n4lu,mrfuffcans,15,Mon May 4 22:22:05 2015 UTC,"I think the logic here is that people never really found these girls endearing or attractive in the first place so when they dress to repel others they can blame rejection on their fashion rather than their hygiene, weight or horrible personality."

justlegbeardthings,34n4lu,sweetjingle,13,Sat May 2 20:26:40 2015 UTC,That's right. Everrrrrrything you do revolves around men. Don't you drop autonomy by making all of your choices based around what you think men think?
justlegbeardthings,34n4lu,Chezkel,8,Sat May 2 20:27:10 2015 UTC,Because generalizing about a gender is alright as long as it's targeted at stupid men!
justlegbeardthings,34n4lu,TheIcelander,2,Sat May 2 22:44:55 2015 UTC,"Her excuse I, I shit you not. It's satire. Do these cunts even realize what that word means?   ""the primary, intended target of the video was the bounty of articles, columns, interviews, videos, etc that dictate how women should wear/look like/etc to make themselves more appealing to men. regardless of whether they were written by men or women, the overall message is absolutely ridiculous. so in response, i made a satirical video which played on the ludicrousness of the articles/videos/magazines' original intent. the secondary targets are men who legitimately think that way — that is, the ""women should dress to make themselves aesthetically pleasing to men"" way. the men in question only represent a portion of the male population. when i talk about men in the video, those are the men to which i am referring, not the entire male population. i totally know that there are plenty of men who live and let live, and who don't shame or guilt women into dressing for men's pleasure. these types of men are totally fine by me, and are not at all targets of the video. so really, instead of getting hot and fussy about generalization, they really ought to remove themselves from the equation, sit back, relax, and have a laugh. :- ) TL;DR: if you're a man and you allow women look the way they want, then you're cool; keep doing what you're doing! watch this video with an open mind and let yourself laugh a little bit. if you're a man and you try to guilt or shame women based on their appearance, then you ought to be carried off by a hawk and dropped in a river."""

justlegbeardthings,34n4lu,willyscoot,3,Fri May 29 13:24:07 2015 UTC,I was expecting something but got something else entirely. Such a closeted person. Let's see:   Wear high-waist pants because men like to show off their flat butt and don't like yoga pants. What? Wear sneakers because that confuses men. What?? Wear makeup because that makes men think you're hiding something. And here I thought legbeards found makeup oppressive. Escape the room because men despise the presence of women.
