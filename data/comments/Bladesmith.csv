Bladesmith,3e3fsk,joe_m107,3,Tue Jul 21 17:38:40 2015 UTC,"pretty much, it's just about making some aesthetic choices.   first and foremost, how high are you going to take the bevel on the cutting edge, that'll help determine where you start at the point - whether you want it to start at the very tip or back where the top of your main bevel meets the spine. as for the the other end, maybe decide how close to the fuller you want it. also, do you want it to be an even and uniform swedge from end to end or thinner at the tip and thicker at the spine (eliminating the need for a plunge line). at the point, do you want it to start at the back edge of the tip or closer to the mid-line. liner or radial - a straight line from beginning to end, or, slightly curved ending at/near the point of the shoulder in front of the fuller. all things to ask yourself and who you're making it for.  for the gough jig, i would imagine it's just a matter of using a hole closer to the blade for your eye bolt and keep it higher at a steeper angle than for the cutting edge. maybe practice on some scrap metal if you have it, anything really, just as long as it's a similar thickness (it doesn't have to be but it will be more visual of something thicker)."
Bladesmith,3e3fsk,free_will_is_arson,2,Tue Jul 21 22:10:50 2015 UTC,I ended up filing the bevels tonight. I decided to eliminate the plunge line from the false edge and do a tapered bevel from the top of the spine towards the point. It looks pretty good. Tomorrow I'll file the main bevel and post a pic.

Bladesmith,3dyv7d,usernamewillendabrup,2,Mon Jul 20 19:05:21 2015 UTC,"Well it adds hardness and edge retention. So if you don't plan to actually use the knife that much, if ever, then you should be fine. I don't really use my knives that often but I heat treat them anyway."
Bladesmith,3dyv7d,Fargraven,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:41:54 2015 UTC,"You don't HAVE to, but your knife will suck.  It won't hold an edge for long and will be damaged very easily.  If you've hardened and/or quenched the knife, it may hold an edge but will break much easier.     Heat treating is easy once you get the process down.  Don't fear the light!  You can certainly make an edge with just a hand file.  Hold the file perpendicular to the knife and pull from the handle to the tip at the angle you want for the edge."
Bladesmith,3dyv7d,Octomagon,2,Mon Jul 20 18:06:08 2015 UTC,"You can put an edge on the knife the same way this guy puts a bevel on his:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFj51A-gdz4  He pushed the file, where as I learned to pull it in one long motion.  When you're riding the edge at the correct angle, you can feel it."

Bladesmith,3dyv7d,TorchForge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:02 2015 UTC,"There is no point in taking the time to make a knife if you're not going to put it through a heat treatment process. Only exception is when you're doing stock removal of a piece of barstock that was already put through heat treatment to achieve a good hardness:toughness:abrasion-resistance ratio (just be careful to not overheat during grinding).  As for making an edge, just use waterstones. You'll need to start with a lower grit, but a good quality waterstone will remove material fast. Making a bevel is different than making an edge though. You will probably want to use drawfiling to make your bevel, but this will be difficult if the stock is already hard. If the stock is harder than the file, then filing won't work at all.  Honestly, if you're limited to hand tools only your best bet is to anneal your steel, drawfile the bevels, drill your pin holes, put it through heat treatment, and then develop your edge on stones (in that order)."
Bladesmith,3dyv7d,free_will_is_arson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:47:06 2015 UTC,"i'll give you a bit different of an example. i had a bar of precision ground O1, annealed, it had a nice crisp edge to it so i tried to spark my flint stick on it. not only did it not spark but it deformed the edge of the steel.   so if you intend to get any, any, practical use out the knife beyond opening mail (and i don't even mean cardboard, just paper envelopes) than i would highly suggest heat treatment.  as for the 'truck coat' (like, spray-on rubberized bed liner?), do you intend to coat the entire knife or just the handle."
Bladesmith,3dyv7d,free_will_is_arson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:22:23 2015 UTC,Something to make the blade black I'm intending to coat the whole knife then put the handle on
Bladesmith,3dyv7d,NoSpaceForGoodName,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:41:19 2015 UTC,"than i would go with the duracoat or something of the like over something rubberized. if you were just coating the handle, bed liner would be a great choice (in fact, you've given me some good ideas about skeletonized handles) but not on the blade portion, it will cause too much traction and make it almost impossible to cut anything as well as probably wear off in an unpleasant manner."
Bladesmith,3dyuxg,Inotreb,5,Mon Jul 20 17:25:53 2015 UTC,Leave some extra material there.  When your metal gets thin you run the risk of cracking it during the quench.  It's also good to have extra material because the heat treating process will oxidize the surface.  You'll want to grind that scale off and leave a smooth finish.
Bladesmith,3dyuxg,Wiz52,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:28:53 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  I think I am going to take very little off in the way of an edge before heat treating.  I'll get the edge started, heat treat and then have a nice angle reference to grind the edge out on my belt sander. We'll see how she goes!"
Bladesmith,3dyuxg,ClapeyronNS,2,Tue Jul 21 02:25:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert by any means (only made a few knives)... but from what I've read on this subreddit from people who definitely seems skilled and experienced and other books and knife makers sites, there's a risk (or certainty depending on method chosen) that the outer layer of steel becomes decarburized, which is why you should leave some steel to make an edge from after heat treatment"

A good shop can keep a 12"" knife flat to within 0.015"".  I suggest you discuss the matter with your prospective shops and set a flatness spec when you place an order.    Alternatively, you can allow for some warp by grinding flat after heat-treating."

But seriously, they are really easy to use, fun, cheapish, clean burning, and not much more dangerous than a bbq... so that's an option.    Not sure if maker place has a forge/anvil...  I'd look that up.  Ucsd has a craft center with forging.  Junior colleges might have some too.  Lots of ferriers in north county that probably have shops set up.  They have some blacksmithing classes at a train museum around san diego somewhere (lakeside maybe?).  Imo, and some people will disagree vehemntly, you're not going to learn too much in a class you cant figure out yourself online with forging.    You'd get better responces in the blacksmith sub."

Took me all of 1 afternoon to make something for each of the 5 houses around me, and somehow I never got reported.

The plunge line is a little strange, usually it would bisect the choil.  But, good plunges are one of the hardest things to master, and the more mistakes you make the more they tend to migrate towards the butt.  Really nice work on a first knife, I'm guessing you will learn very fast and be producing excellent knives in no time.  Edit- on second look, what I thought was the plunge line is a reflection I believe.  Comes in about 3/4s of the way down the choil?  If that's the case, the trick there is avoiding washing out your plunges and facets.  Nick Wheeler has a couple videos on youtube that will sort you right out on that!"
Bladesmith,3dsmi3,A-Grey-World,5,Sun Jul 19 03:59:15 2015 UTC,"Mate thank you very much, that means a lot coming from you; I must've gone through your kitchen knife build at least a dozen times!  The plunge line is definitely the most flawed part of the blade, I am using a gough filing jig and found it to be quite difficult to get a clean line, and not only that, but to have it even on both sides.  The initial intent for this knife was to have a partial bevel, but when it came to hand sanding I found it to be too difficult to keep the bevel and the flat part separate and so ended up filing it down into one continous  section. Until I can afford a proper belt grinder I will keep all my bevels at edge to spine for simplicity.  Thanks again for the feedback"
Bladesmith,3dsmi3,aarongough,2,Sun Jul 19 07:18:35 2015 UTC,It's by far the hardest thing. I was considering setting up a gough jig because I struggle so much with a 1x30 belt dander...  Looks really great though.
Bladesmith,3dsmi3,weps_grd_pandemonium,6,Sun Jul 19 18:57:38 2015 UTC,"Looking good mate! Just read through the other comments, sounds like you've got a handle on things! (pun intended!)  The reason the bevel/flats blended together is likely twofold:   1) sandpaper not held tightly enough against a hard sanding block.. This is likely the main reason. If the sandpaper is loose and has space to move around at all it will soften the transition line very quickly! This is the reason why I made my fancy sanding block. You can also use waterstones for finishing to avoid this issue. I sometimes use 'EDM stones' from moldshoptools.com when I'm finishing something that needs to have very clearly defined transition lines.  2) Steel perhaps a bit thin? I have found that doing a saber grind on 1/8""  steel generally results in an indistinct transition line, whereas the same on 5/32"" steel will be easier to get well defined. This is essentially because the same height saber grind on 5/32"" steel will produce a steeper bevel angle... I don't think you said how thick the blade is so I'm not sure if that's a contributing factor.  It's looking very good! There's a lot of pitfalls with blade finishing and it can take a while to get right, seems like you're well on your way though!  -Aaron"

Bladesmith,3dpzv2,kenofthesea,9,Sat Jul 18 09:05:15 2015 UTC,Should be fine.  Test it to make sure.  You wouldnt have been the first knifemaker to fall asleep and leave it in the oven all night.  Tempering is more about the temperature than duration.  Only risk of increased times would be a higher risk that your oven cycles above your temp over and over.
Bladesmith,3dpzv2,tiktock34,3,Sat Jul 18 11:56:23 2015 UTC,Thats how long you should temper for.  2x 2 hours. 4 hours at once is not going to hurt it.
Bladesmith,3dpzv2,thesirenlady,3,Sat Jul 18 14:49:33 2015 UTC,I thought that might be case. Then why temper twice for 2 hours while letting it cool in between? What does this accomplish?
Bladesmith,3dpzv2,rdeker,3,Sat Jul 18 19:14:13 2015 UTC,"It will be fine. Tempering is mainly about temperature, not time. You should still do your second tempering cycle though. There is a reason that you're supposed to do it twice. I've had a long week and am too tired to write it all up now, but trust me, you should still do the second temper."
Bladesmith,3dpzv2,usernamewillendabrup,2,Sun Jul 19 01:22:56 2015 UTC,Do you  have a link for anything that will be able to explain why it has to be done two times?
Bladesmith,3dpzv2,A-Grey-World,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:17:03 2015 UTC,Two sets of two tempers is what I've always heard recommended. Since temperature is the important thing and the colour is fine I'd say it's going to be absolutely fine.
Bladesmith,3dpzv2,TorchForge,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:11:18 2015 UTC,"Tempering for extended periods of time can actually cause embrittlement of the steel along the grain boundaries. That being said, it wouldn't occur unless you put the steel through multiple cycles of 6-8 hours or longer. If you had left it in overnight, you would probably want to normalize and put it through heat treat again.  That being said, you're fine. No worries."

Bladesmith,3dmr4v,roy20050,3,Fri Jul 17 18:59:56 2015 UTC,Bone doesn't have a solid core you can rely on. Are you thinking of antler?
Bladesmith,3dmr4v,allsortsofmeow,2,Sat Jul 18 01:13:06 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the tang take up the interior of the bone making it wrong enough? I think it would have to be a think section of antler to work but yeah that would look awesome.
Bladesmith,3dmr4v,roy20050,2,Sat Jul 18 01:28:47 2015 UTC,"Bone is full of marrow man, marrow degrades and isn't particularly hard. That's why dried out bones are hollow.   You can get around this by having a bolster and a butt cap though, to hold the handle rigid and the tang in place. Makes for a light handle."

Bladesmith,3do38a,yangxiaodong,2,Fri Jul 17 22:28:04 2015 UTC,"The knife looks really beautiful, especially the handle and guard, although the mustard patina could have been done more through, it looks kinda like rust at the moment (might just have been bad pics/my monitor might be odd right now though). The only real issue i can see with it is that the blade's got a kinda obvious weak point, but aside from that i'd love to have one of those for whittling and display."
Bladesmith,3do38a,yangxiaodong,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:12:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input, always appreciated! The reason i got so weird with the blade design is because its a low grade unknown carbon steel. Its sharp enough to be able to puncture through material but thats about it. Its going to stay fairly dull, and is more just for show :). I have made other blades out of the same steel and they can turn out fairly decent but after all the work polishing and making sure the edge is perfect, it will dull out in about 1 to 2 real uses. So with that, i dont anticipate the blade ever breaking because of that weak spot although if this blade would be used for anything serious, you are absolutely correct."
Bladesmith,3do38a,yangxiaodong,2,Sat Jul 18 17:15:03 2015 UTC,"Alright! and i actually like the nitch or however you spell it a bit, it would be great for cutting rope, i just wanted to point that out because it always sucks when someone spends so much time making something that beautiful just to accidentally break it trying to split logs or something.  what wood is that?"
Bladesmith,3do38a,yangxiaodong,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:11:14 2015 UTC,"LMAO i totally know where you are coming from! Most of the knives i make are full tang handles. So i figured on my first go through this one i was going to fuck it up real good, thus i left a lot of imperfections and strange designs in it for shits and giggles. Turned out better than i planned, but i still love full tangs the most. And the wood is Bloodwood. Really pretty and feels amazing once you bring it to a 320 grit. Do you have any recommendations on wood oils or finishes? So far ive only every used tung oil, and it usually looks very nice. But from time to time i can tell it makes the natural wood pattern a little muddy."
Bladesmith,3do38a,Nebo64,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:22:33 2015 UTC,"I personally use linseed oil or mineral oil, although a good friend of mine who does a lot of woodworking says that he'll use beeswax as well for this stuff, although i've got no clue where to get that. IMO mineral oil is good but stays oily pretty long, but linseed is pretty good.   How is working with bloodwood? i love using maple wood, but that shit splits WAY too fast."

Bladesmith,3djah7,boxingnun,2,Fri Jul 17 13:21:24 2015 UTC,I second this question! Other ones I'd add are:   What is the angle of the cutting edge? (To know how much material will be able to back the edge) What is the depth of cut in your material? (To get an idea of the chip formation to make a guess at the pressure exerted by the material against the edge as the chip curls)

I have done damascus in the past but I'm not permanently set up to make it so its quite labor intensive.  You can find random ladder pattern damascus billets from many sources online these days, though, and all should generally align when double ground evenly."
Bladesmith,3dgjg8,midnightsmith,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:39:07 2015 UTC,That is by far the most beautiful blade I've ever laid eyes on
Bladesmith,3dgjg8,midnightsmith,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:05:16 2015 UTC,That blade is hypnotic!
Bladesmith,3dfjg2,LearnArmor,6,Wed Jul 15 21:39:25 2015 UTC,"I would not go by color unless you are experienced.  Go by magnetism.  You are shooting to bring the blade above its curie point which is marked by when it loses its ability to be attracted to a magnet.  Periodically take the blade out as it gets cherry red.  Place a magnet up to it and if it sticks, put the blade back in.  Once you get to the point of non-magnetism you now have a new goal which is to NOT raise the temp any higher but to let it ""soak"" at that temperature.  When i do O1 at home I actually let it soak for some time (think 20-30 minutes) but I am doing it with a digitally controlled oven and I remove all oxygen from the blade's atmosphere to avoid over oxidizing the blade.  It really does need a long soak but unless you have the means to control temps exactly and to avoid over oxidizing the blade I would go for 4-5 minutes.  You should be shooting for a few minutes at least at critical temp but dont overheat.  O1 is almost air hardening at blade thicknesses and it has a relatively long ""nose"" on the quench meaning you have a few seconds to get the blade from critical temp to below the hardening temp which is around 400 degrees.  As other have said, oil at 130 is fine.  Remember to slice into the oil tip and edge first and then continuously move the blade up and down to avoid the oil forming a vapor pocket around the blade. Once you can hold it by hand without burning yourself get that sucker into the tempering oven.  At that point the blade will be VERY brittle...think almost like a ceramic.  You could snap it by hand easily.  You need to temper it at around 400, let it go to room temp then repeat at least 2 times.  O1 has its pros and cons vs 1095.  O1 is much easier to heat treat in term of the quench time because 1095 requires a much more aggressive quench and you have about one second to cool it.  On the other hand, 1095 doesnt require nearly as long a soak time as O1 so its easier for a home forge."
Bladesmith,3dfjg2,tiktock34,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:39:37 2015 UTC,Excellent information thank you.  I had read that I wanted to temper the blade for an hour for every inch thickness of the steel but to always do at least 2 hours.  Does that sound about right?
Bladesmith,3dfjg2,tiktock34,3,Thu Jul 16 01:48:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah that sounds about right.  If its a chef's knife people tend to keep them a bit harder than a knife that might see heavy abuse like a camp knife.  That being said, chefs knives are very very thin so you dont want them brittle.  I'd temper twice at 400 for two hours each time cooling to room temp in between.  Any higher and you might make it too soft for a chef's knife."
Bladesmith,3dfjg2,Frequent-Flyer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:21:01 2015 UTC,That sounds like a good target time
Bladesmith,3dfjg2,A-Grey-World,3,Thu Jul 16 15:57:02 2015 UTC,"1500ºF, or a bright Cherry Red is what you are looking for Vegetable oil works great, and you should preheat it to around 130ºF If you dont bother with annealing, your blade will be so hard it will be very brittle; if you drop the blade, it will likely shatter! Your kitchen oven will work fine! Many have done that, but some have complained of the smell. There will be no toxic gas, but you'll be fine.  as far as annealing data, you can google ""Heat treating O1 steel"" and you should be able to find all the info you need."
Bladesmith,3dfjg2,Frequent-Flyer,8,Wed Jul 15 21:47:11 2015 UTC,"If you dont bother with annealing, your blade will be so hard it will be very brittle; if you drop the blade, it will likely shatter * as far as annealing data, you can google ""Heat treating O1 steel"" and you should be able to find all the info you need.    Whoa there, are you confusing annealing with tempering?   Op would have purchased annealed o1 stock. Annealing is done by heating to critical and letting cool very slowly and it makes the steel nice and soft so you can work it.   Op might be thinking of normalisation?  This is a similar process done before heat treatment, but is only really needed if the steel is hot worked like forging and hammering the shape.   For a blank cold worked to shape, best just to harden then temper."
Bladesmith,3dfjg2,_blixy,2,Wed Jul 15 22:03:52 2015 UTC,"Yep! I was confusing the two. Since OP was asking heat treating questions, I guess my brain thought he meant tempering."

Bladesmith,3dfjg2,BrokenCrw,3,Wed Jul 15 22:41:30 2015 UTC,You can thermal cycle it x3 prior to your quench to get some great grain structure
Bladesmith,3dcg86,Cheesecurls,5,Wed Jul 15 04:37:19 2015 UTC,"Interesting pattern, almost looks like flint or obsidian knapping the way you textured the grips and the notches/blade pattern matches and continues it.    ..reminiscent of the 'dragonglass' daggers the Knight's Watch brothers had in Game of Thrones.  I think it would be cool to try to emulate the flaked obsidian even more, get more random with the knurl.  eh? no? yeah?   Something bigger/wider with the same styling, maybe double sided would be both unique and impressive. Not that this one isn't ..it's pretty awesome and I don't wanna take anything away from it.  I just think this grip/serration/mustard scale combo would also work really well on a leaf-blade style dagger like this shape but a tad fatter.   roundabout way of saying ""I dig it, make some more!"""

Bladesmith,3dcg86,finiteparadox,2,Wed Jul 15 10:38:39 2015 UTC,"Cool knife. Here are my thoughts (remember, my thoughts are opinions, feel free to disagree):  The anso pattern (I think that's what some people call it) on the handle could use some work. Consistency looks good with the anso pattern. What you have is more random, that could have been intentional, or not. A nice, even, clean anso like this are usually better looking. There are other handle patterns that look great with randomness, like a rock pattern.   Another issue is with the handle pins. With a highly textured pattern like anso, it is really hard to make the pins, lanyard holes, etc look good. Usually they get the pattern applied to them, and become uneven. Then they are hard to polish and then they look unfinished. Consider using recessed chicago screws in a fixed blade with a heavy anso. This will ""hide"" the screws somewhat by having them below the handle and not sticking out.   The mustard patina is cool, it matches the handle pattern. Im not a huge fan of the massive jimping, but that is again just personal style.   Your ricasso is a bit large, assuming your plunge line is around the sharpening choil (it is hard to tell). Also, the bottom edge of the ricasso looks uneven, like it was chipped or  something. Consider rounding the corner, or just making it flat on the next one."
Bladesmith,3dcg86,ShuManChu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:39:09 2015 UTC,"thanks man for the feedback, its great to have in-depth criticism. the anso pattern was intentionally at random. also I agree, I should search for some better pins. to explain what happened to the ricasso area, here is a rendition of what it was like before I messed it up on the vice http://i.imgur.com/0fytT7a.png  I wasn't paying attention and when I secured it in the vice with padding, that part was exposed to the jaw. I then tried to fix it up using a file(didnt turn out as well as I would of hoped). As for the bevel, after I  polished the blade with sandpaper, the then clearly visible bevel sort of blended in with the rest. the picture posted was more of a rendition of fresh off the belt sander and filers. your input has greatly helped with identifying some of my own errors, thanks!"

Bladesmith,3dbt1m,thecollecter,6,Wed Jul 15 01:25:23 2015 UTC,You can come up with your own design or call Ernie Grospitch and he can help come up with something simple and then make the stencils for you. Look up diy electro etcher and they can be made easily and cheap. It's a pretty simple way to get your mark on a blade. Another option is to find a simple metal stamp set and you can do initials. Amazon would have a set for pretty cheap.
Bladesmith,3dbt1m,FJ1906,3,Wed Jul 15 01:49:46 2015 UTC,I didn't use Ernie but I called a place New York and did the diy method. Pic of the results: http://ironbeardworkshop.com/2015/07/10/fresh-off-the-bench/img_18792/  Also Trollskyy on YouTube has a good video but you can use a 9volt battery as well: http://youtu.be/S75lHYSF9wU
Bladesmith,3dbt1m,dirtymunke,3,Wed Jul 15 03:24:18 2015 UTC,"+1 for Ernie.  I use him with a Personalizer Plus system.  I etch very deep, not just a mark on the surface.  Things always come out crisp and the stencils are high quality.  Example: http://i.imgur.com/fITjnBc.jpg"
Bladesmith,3dbt1m,tiktock34,2,Thu Jul 16 02:24:08 2015 UTC,"Another vote for Ernie.  I had my cousin the graphic designer design me one, and Ernie did the stencils.  I use a 50 amp battery charger and salt water to electro-etch the blade.  Works pretty damn well."
Bladesmith,3dbl49,LouRedwood,5,Wed Jul 15 00:23:25 2015 UTC,"I quickly wished I had went with good stones from the start. I recently sold mine and bought new. I began with some medium budget stone. But actually prize is not much higher for the really good stuff. I would recommend a naniwa chosera or professional (same stone) 1k for start. It's super fast, splash and go, and don't dish much. Would be about the same prize as that combo stone. I think a 1k edge that you carefully put a good edge with and strop after is great. If you later on want polish you can get some 5-6k stone to compliment. Or maybe a coarse atoma plate before, they're great for flattening stones and edge repairs."
Bladesmith,3dbl49,RDalman,3,Wed Jul 15 05:47:45 2015 UTC,"It depends.  If you are looking to set the edge with this, then you will need a lower grit.  If you use something else to start the edge, and then want to finish with this stone, then that is a different story.  Water stones are no easier or harder than any other stone.  Getting the right angle requires practice.  You can booger up an edge real quick if you fuck the angle up.  For your first stone, get a cheaper combo stone, like King.  You will pay a third of the price and get good practice.  The cheaper stones works great as well."
Bladesmith,3dbl49,shrikezulu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:52:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I ended up going with the King 1000/6000 combo to learn and get some practice. King was mentioned on another thread I posted on as well. Also, I have seen that it is a decent stone for most kitchen knives, and I like the fact that there is a more fine 6000 side for increased polishing. I will see how it goes and try to update after it arrives."
Bladesmith,3db7sb,cambootyslam,6,Tue Jul 14 22:40:26 2015 UTC,ideally you'd carve the inverse of the milled parts of the handle so that the scale has something to index against. Then you'll need a barrel screw assembly of some type. You can get them from USAknifemaker

Bladesmith,3d63hi,tuseroni,7,Mon Jul 13 20:33:42 2015 UTC,"for master craftsmen, sure, forging will always produce a superior product. but the hobbyist, i think the difference is negligible, you won't have the skill yet to produce an even surface or uniform line so you'll have to grind some anyways to get your final shape. why not start with a precision ground surface (like you said, obviously easier).  i'd suggest focusing on stock removal to get your hands-on-metal experience in shaping and grinding bevels and what not and just experiment on the side with forging. maybe you'll find you won't like it and prefer the reduction method. at the very least it'll allow you to keep making some knives while learning the skill necessary for forging.  but of course, it's your hobby, it's up to you and the only way to get to that master craftsmen range is to do it."
Bladesmith,3d63hi,free_will_is_arson,2,Mon Jul 13 21:32:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Trying both not only helps you find out what you like more, but if you decide you want to only use one method it will also help you appreciate the other method and the work people do to make knives that way."
Bladesmith,3d63hi,Fluffee2025,2,Tue Jul 14 02:27:43 2015 UTC,"i find i definitely prefer forging, its much more fun than cutting and grinding. it's like shaping modeling clay but the clay is metal, and when you cut and grind you lose all that metal, and if you fuck up you can't put metal back ON (also one of the things i don't like about carving) when it comes time i have to grind it's usually the least enjoyable part of the project (course i'm also using a hand file so...there's that)"
Bladesmith,3d63hi,Blacksmith210,2,Tue Jul 14 02:45:35 2015 UTC,"Well for me there's just something about forging it and not just grinding away steel. If you don't care about how awesome it is to be able to forge whatever you want from dead bolts and hinges to swords then I would say the biggest difference is that you can re shape metal. You can move it around, and you can forge weld it together. When it comes to grinding all you can do is remove steel. You need stock that is bigger than your final product in all dimensions where as you could make a 12"" dagger from a coil spring off a car with forging. The quality will be the same either way if you know what you are doing but forging opens up so much more potential."
Bladesmith,3d63hi,squilliam132457,2,Tue Jul 14 01:28:00 2015 UTC,"Forging gives you more freedom since you're not restricted to a thickness of 2 or 3mm or whatever sheet you buy. It also influences the design of the blade because a hidden tang becomes more straightforward than a full tang, integral bolsters etc.  Metallurgically, the best forged knife would only be marginally better than the best stick removal knife so there is really no tangible benefit there. If you are laminating or pattern welding obviously you have to forge and these bring their own pros and cons."
Bladesmith,3d63hi,PunchyPalooka,-2,Tue Jul 14 07:36:07 2015 UTC,"A forged blade has longer dendrites. These grant helpful properties and advantages over simply extracting the shape of the blade from a piece of steel stock.  Given that you use identical steel for both blades: A forged blade will hold its edge longer, and flex and return to original position more reliably.  Edit:  I've been looking into this over the past few days because this discussion has piqued my interest anew. I still believe that forging has its applications (and that it is certainly preferable in attaining certain properties, e.g., shear strength, impact strength), but from what I've read there's no need to forge something as simply shaped as a blade.  It appears the two most important elements necessary to a quality blade are choosing the right steel for the job, and properly heat treating your work.  Here is the link to the most concise and clear explanation on the subject that I found."
Bladesmith,3d63hi,PunchyPalooka,3,Tue Jul 14 19:48:38 2015 UTC,"according to that very link dendrites only form when a material goes from molten and cools below the freezing point (when it becomes a solid) without solidifying and then solidifies quickly (supercooling), this is a process which would NOT happen during forging, not even during quenching."
Bladesmith,3d63hi,rdeker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:00:50 2015 UTC,I didn't claim that forging formed dendrites. Forging elongates them.

I'd love to read the papers. Bars used for stock removal are usually cut from sheet, which has itself been HEAVILY deformed by forging at the mill. The little bit of pushing around I do with a hammer isn't going to elongate any dendrites significantly by comparison."

Bladesmith,3d63hi,en4bz,0,Tue Jul 14 01:34:20 2015 UTC,"Not entirely. Forging (especially recycled steel) can produce a much stronger and more uniform grain structure.  It is true that modern steel production can give a billet damn near any grain structure the customer wants.  So forging is no longer necessary but can still produce a far superior blade than stock removal alone.  San Mai construction can't be done by stock removal alone and produces a wonderfully useful blade. ;-)  Though I do agree that most of the art and science is in the heat-treat, so the methods up to that point aren't nearly as important as what happens in the heat-treat."

Bladesmith,3d63hi,Zamboni_Driver,7,Fri Jul 17 04:38:33 2015 UTC,"That's just not true...forging metal into shape preserves the ""grain"" in the steel as opposed to just grinding it away.

Bladesmith,3d63hi,Zamboni_Driver,2,Mon Jul 13 22:49:06 2015 UTC,"This is not always true. Grain flow will not have significant effect on strength or hardness of a forging. It will affect the ductility, toughness, fatigue due to the grains being perpendicular to the direction of crack propagation. You cannot assume the grains align, it takes specific steps to align grains. A crack is going to want to travel along its easiest path so without perpendicular grains, grain flow means nothing."
Bladesmith,3d63hi,sneeker1988,2,Tue Jul 14 01:15:24 2015 UTC,"Do powdered metals have a long grain like that, or are they closer to the cast metals?  Do you have any info on what the grain actually does for strength and edge retention."

Bladesmith,3d63hi,thesirenlady,2,Tue Jul 14 02:10:04 2015 UTC,"Strength is mostly decided at the crystal structure of the metal, so the chemistry of the alloy will play a greater role in strength than the grains.  Edge retention is mostly a hardness thing so same as the strength. Grain structure will have some effect but will mostly see grain structure effecting crack propagation. So things like ductility, fatigue, toughness will see different results based on grain structure."

You need to hammer the rod down into a blade shape and into a good thickness for a knife.  You would also hammer out a tang as well.  I have to say, if you are new to forging then I would stick with rectangular stock until you are more experienced.  Forging out 1"" drill rod into an acceptable blade shape will be tiring, and challenging for an inexperienced person."

Over that I glued and riveted Aluminium sheets in place. It is pins (or rivets?) in both ends, but for ease and to make sure it's a straight, undeformed, pin I used ""pop rivets"" in the hinges  to make sure there is a slight room for play in the hinges I stuck in the template, I used to curve the sheet metal, in the handles when I hammered or tightened the rivets  This is where most of my inspiration came from  though I don't have a drill press, so free-handing all the drill holes cost me two drill bits  Thanks so much, I'm really satisfied as well! hope to see your next one on here in the future"

Bladesmith,3cw79g,KalutikaKink,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:20:11 2015 UTC,I'm interested. How much?
Bladesmith,3cw79g,KalutikaKink,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:10:14 2015 UTC,For straight razors? Not sure between $100-250. Some will be open blade and some will have sheath.   Thanks!
Bladesmith,3cw79g,IllegalMonk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:21:13 2015 UTC,Thanks kindly. I'd love to know a bit more about the process. Is there somewhere I could get more info? I have a fair number of technical questions and don't want to bog you down with those.
Bladesmith,3cw79g,IllegalMonk,-1,Sat Jul 11 22:09:57 2015 UTC,"Be aware that when you're buying a straight razor from a knife-maker you run the risk of poor tempering that makes it incapable of taking an edge for shaving, and also the poor geometry can make it impossible to set the bevel correctly.  I'd recommend contacting someone with an established reputation, buyer beware. If you're looking for a decent price on a custom razor I'd talk to ShaveSmith, /u/rockymtnaristocrat. Joe Edson does phenomenal work, but a little more expensive I think."
Bladesmith,3cw79g,KalutikaKink,2,Sat Jul 11 20:08:49 2015 UTC,Seems like you know a lot about my brothers shop. Have you tried him? Just because you have not heard from him does not mean you need to go to all of my photos and talk shit about him. Also seems like you like to steer people away from new comers to the market. Good sport.
Bladesmith,3cw79g,IllegalMonk,-3,Sat Jul 11 20:39:58 2015 UTC,"Nope, lots of people sell poor quality razors cause they make knives and assume the process is the same. $100-$250 is a large sum to risk on an untested maker."
Bladesmith,3cw79g,KalutikaKink,2,Sat Jul 11 20:49:15 2015 UTC,Agree with you there. But instead of taking away people and directing them to other makers you should talk to OP about the quality and ask to have testing done. Otherwise you look like a complete POS.
Bladesmith,3cw79g,GKnives,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:57:41 2015 UTC,"Consider me aware.  I'm well versed in straight razors and have a good awareness of the difference the temper makes. From my straight razors and lathe tools to my leather tools and drill bits, I spend a lot of time thinking about blades, bevels, sharpening and rockwell ratings.  Asking for a baseline price lets me figure out the weight of the gamble I'd be making by trying out a new tool maker.   Thanks though."
Bladesmith,3cw79g,GKnives,2,Sat Jul 11 22:09:45 2015 UTC,"Right on man. Honestly I shouldn't have expected less from a bladesmith forum. My knowledge is limited to razors, so I'm quick to urge caution in cases with limited feedback like this.   Go for and if you do sample the work then definitely let me know how the quality is, a potential primary customer base will likely be on the subreddits I frequent and I'd love to see some new good work out there."
Bladesmith,3cvw6i,destroyer90z,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:27:08 2015 UTC,What technique are you using to add those textures to the blade?

Bladesmith,3cvjv4,NotSoGreatGonzo,2,Sat Jul 11 18:05:22 2015 UTC,"First blade you ever made, but you've been blacksmithing for years and have the basics and intermediaries down? I mean, it's just a socketed finial done at a larger size, so it should be pretty simple and straight forward. If not, if this is actually the first thing you've ever done in metal work, good luck. Not meaning to come off as an ass, but you're taking a really big bite here. My best advise is to learn all you can about ornamental blacksmithing, agricultural blacksmith and then proceed to metallurgy and blades. Trust me, I started out the wrong way around and could have taken 10 years off my journey had I just done it in the right order. Either way, the post I'm going to link is a little old and takes a few turns into information you don't need, but there's some great pictures and the basic design for a top tool to do sockets nicely. Take a look at http://www.iforgeiron.com/topic/5786-need-help-forging-a-socket/"
Bladesmith,3cvjv4,zero_fiat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:55:22 2015 UTC,i'd probably do a double edged blade with a paracord wrap and filework on the handle with notches to let you wrap it onto a walking stick.
Bladesmith,3ctaxw,zero_fiat,2,Fri Jul 10 16:32:51 2015 UTC,"(figured I'd copy my accompanying text here as well) This is a san mai kukri I'm making for a custom order. Steels are 15N20 and 1084. I use this combination not for any metallurgical magic or anything like that but because I like the look. I've got 2 days into making this piece, first day was making the billet, day 2 was forging it to the rough shape. Had a few things going on here at home so I wont get it back in the shop until my knife making class this weekend - which is fine because I'll use it for demonstrating heat treating. With any luck she should be wrapped up by Monday and I'll get to start carving the wood and forming the leather for the sheath. :)"

Bladesmith,3ct2dj,squilliam132457,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:18:26 2015 UTC,"Well the usual suggestion is a harbour freight 1x30. I own something analogous, it works but it isn't very nice. In a lot of ways the wider belt of a wood sander is better, but I haven't tried them."
Bladesmith,3ct2dj,itsrocketsurgery,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:26:34 2015 UTC,"Well just got a second person saying that so it sounds like a good choice, plus it a fair bit cheaper than I was expecting, thanks"
Bladesmith,3ct2dj,itsrocketsurgery,2,Fri Jul 10 19:23:02 2015 UTC,"I use the 1x30 from Harbor Frieght for exactly that and it works decently well. I've sharpened pocket knives, leatherman blades, kitchen knives, a couple axes and a hatchet and it worked really well. Especially since Harbor Freight stocks the zirconia belts in 40 grit and 80 grit, it makes reprofiling hardened metal go so much faster now.  I ended up using it to reprofile the main bevel of the knives I made for my groomsmen after they were heat treated and it worked out well. I then used some belts up to 600 grit to put the primary cutting edge on and a leather strop belt with chromium oxide compound to polish the edge up. It gets it really sharp, you just have to be careful of overheating the edge and ruining the temper, it happens quickly as you get to the tip of the blade."

Stock removal, check out Aaron Gough's youtube channel, he has a great guide on making a filing jig.   In terms of steel, start with something very simple like 1084, or if you're paying for heat treat from a professional something like 440c/AEB-L."

Bladesmith,3cnaxx,itde,5,Thu Jul 9 07:15:20 2015 UTC,"Should have added X-post from /r/knives, although I think we're pretty isolated from the reddiquette police around here.  I had some thin 440C from jantz that had been kicking around for a while and I had no plans for, so I decided to experiment a bit and make this. First knife I've done with a plunge in a few months, quite happy with the results there. Turns out this was probably the hardest grind I've ever done, the blade is so thin and flimsy that keeping the surfaces flat is a real challenge. Everything you do, both pre and post-ht, will curve the blade and you constantly have to be working it back to straight. Wasn't sure how it would fare through ht being super thin (0.005"" at edge, ~0.09"" spine), but Peters' nailed it as usual and it came back spot on. Handle is ironwood burl, fastened with two corbys on either side of the mosaic pin, with G10 spacers against the tang."

Bladesmith,3cnaxx,allsortsofmeow,2,Thu Jul 9 13:56:01 2015 UTC,I'm curious why you still use Peters'? Are you planning on doing your own HT at any point?
Bladesmith,3cnaxx,largos,2,Thu Jul 9 12:26:12 2015 UTC,"With the steels I usually use, no.  Most of them require cryo, so even if I got all the equipment to do HT here ($$$), I'd still have to send them out for that.   To pay for a good and big enough kiln, plates, etc, my ROI would be never.  I'm right on the verge of buying an Atlas forge, so some oil hardening carbon steel knives might come back into the repertoire in the future."
Bladesmith,3cnaxx,allsortsofmeow,2,Thu Jul 9 13:52:51 2015 UTC,"I've been looking at buying one of his burners, but honestly they don't look that hard to make. Been researching all types of burners the past few days. I'd like to get into heat treating, but maybe it'd be smarter to just send off until I get more skilled at actually building blades. About how much does it cost for a heat treat w/ Peter's? How many do you send at a time?"
Bladesmith,3cnaxx,icarusjapan,2,Thu Jul 9 16:12:14 2015 UTC,"Well, I've been doing it pretty inefficiently, 3 or 4 at a time, which means I'm paying full pop per blade, so about $26.  I have a batch of ten to go out this time, and if I've understood correctly that should be $100 for all ten since they are all the same material.    A forge definitely wouldn't be that hard to make, but now that this is a half-time job for me, side projects just aren't happening.  I've been dealing with a crowded bench for months because I haven't taken the hour or two to make a band saw stand."

I remember I was making a kitchen knife for my dad and I spent like 10 hours on the scales, only to have them crack when I clamped them during the epoxy. I was so mad.

Bladesmith,3ce04n,yangxiaodong,3,Tue Jul 7 04:22:52 2015 UTC,Decarb will happen to some degree even with a perfect heat treat. You likely just had a piece of scale flake off which is oxidation. That can be because of the atmosphere of your forge or it could have been a bit too hot. Decarb is only a couple thousandths deep usually so when you get to finish grinding it will get ground away into the good steel underneath
Bladesmith,3ce04n,FJ1906,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:35:44 2015 UTC,"Ok.  It also got some lumpy stuff which i think is a hamon, is that right?"
Bladesmith,3ce04n,O-sin,3,Tue Jul 7 11:54:55 2015 UTC,How hot is glowing hot?  Did you check with a magnet? One shade of color above nonmagnetic is what you want for w2. Lumpy stuff is decarb that needs to be ground away. Should be able to start to see hamon even at 60 grit after decarb is ground away. I use a lot of w2.   Edit: are you normalizing before heat treating? I have found that you need a good normalizing process to get a good hamon on w2.

Bladesmith,3c9zs5,ardbeg_head,7,Mon Jul 6 07:01:05 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what I'm looking at. Which bit is the handle? Is it a certain style/for a certain purpose?
Bladesmith,3c9zs5,A-Grey-World,4,Mon Jul 6 09:51:48 2015 UTC,Did you have a cohesive plan before starting or are you sort of just playing it by ear?
Bladesmith,3c9zs5,allsortsofmeow,2,Mon Jul 6 12:08:58 2015 UTC,Playing by the ear 100%.  I definitely messed up both the handle and where the handle attaches to the head.  At this point I want to make it as pretty as I can to make it a learning opportunity.
Bladesmith,3c9zs5,allsortsofmeow,3,Mon Jul 6 15:20:13 2015 UTC,"I cannot stress how important planning is to get a nice result. I will spend anywhere upwards of 3-4 hours drawing designs, cutting templates into balsa and tweaking shapes. Then I'll rough out the shape and make adjustments after. You don't necessarily have to follow your template 100%, but that tidy starting point gives you something more uniform to work with I find.   In terms of making it pretty etc, I would class it as a learning piece, cut ties and move on. You've probably got the feel for the steel/equipment by now so any further finishing is just going to hurt when it's not usable at the end."
Bladesmith,3c9zs5,yelsew5,4,Tue Jul 7 01:19:00 2015 UTC,"The head doesn't seem to be solidly connected to the ""handle,"" which is far too thick and angular. The fact that the handle is made of the same steel as the head means a horribly unbalanced weapon or tool. One of the main features of an axe or hatchet is that most of the weight is near the head to allow greater momentum in the swing. If you'll be attaching wood scales onto that steel handle, the weight will become even more unbalanced. This is wonderful as a learning opportunity, but I would probably admire it as the clumsy first attempt it is and try to finish it off and store it away or put it in the scrap pile. Axes are tough, and it simply won't suffice to cut it straight out of one thickness of stock and grind an edge. For an axe, actual smithing of some kind is almost always required for a usable result. The techniques I know of require drifting or folding and inserting a handle which is lighter than the head, such as wood. Then you need to consider heat treatment. Can you harden the steel through heat and quench? If not, your tool will be soft and won't retain an edge. I would scrap the metal handle, refine the head, and maybe use it as grinding practice. Try to get a smooth curve on your edge and try to make it even. Keep in mind that if you don't bevel the edge with heat and hammer first, grinding may require hours and waste a lot of material. If you're serious about axes, research blacksmithing. Look for local classes, pick up Alex bealer's ""the art of blacksmithing,"" and keep working. If you love knives and bladed weapons, but just got a little ambitious, start with a knife. Without the right tools and knowledge, your efforts will be for nothing. Do your research and try your best. Finish if you like, but if you're serious, read up and try again."
Bladesmith,3c9zs5,yelsew5,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:44:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice!  Honestly I'm not too worried about it being effective.  It is a first knife or blade of any kind and my plan is to finish it as much as I can then move on to something I actually want to make.  I'll be ordering that book to read up on it though.

Bladesmith,3c896o,gnique,0,Mon Jul 6 22:22:05 2015 UTC,"So here is my advice: don't waste your time and energy with files, mystery steel and saw blades. This is the silly shit that has been promulgated by the likes of cowboy idiots and users of Goobers Goop and ""Leading Knifemakers"" magazines. Real knife steel is easier, cheaper, better and can be worked safely with common tool that are NOT 4"" grinders! Talk to Aldo at New Jersey Steel Baron about a stick of 3/32"" 1085 or 1075. Go here:  http://newjerseysteelbaron.com/  Then go here and read. Keep your mouth shut; just read:  http://www.hypefreeblades.com/  I wrote a couple of posts here that may be of some use to you:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Bladesmith/comments/33s2lh/new_in_knifemaking_as_hobby_seek_suggestions/  One question to you - how did you heat your steel for hardening? Because the only way that I know of to get the results you described is to heat in an electric oven without using anti scale compound. Let me know if I can help you or if you have any questions."
Bladesmith,3c896o,thesirenlady,3,Mon Jul 6 01:55:36 2015 UTC,"Whilst I agree with the sentiment, your explanations could use just a little bit of tact"
Bladesmith,3c896o,gnique,0,Mon Jul 6 03:28:29 2015 UTC,"You know I am actually a polite and tactful person normally! But I started out reading books and magazine articles that were supposedly for the benefit of the unlettered and untutored beginning knife maker. Words written by the wizened for those just stepping onto the path. I never dreamed that  a skill as humble and ancient as knife making was populated almost entirely by incompetent charlatans looking only to sell books and fill inches of magazine space! I read The $50 Knife Shop  carefully and arduously. It took me YEARS to figure out that almost ALL of that book is utter foolishness. Have a look at Ed Fowler's Knife Talk! It would have to be much better to be stupid! Just recently in Blade magazine their was an article that explained how to make a knife out of a file using a 4"" grinder.Yeah right! Send someone you care about out to the shop to follow that sage advice. Go to Blade Forum! You will be told of triple quenches and putting hardened blades in the freezer compartment of your refrigerator to drive up the Rockwell number!    It is a belief of mine that when one assumes the mantle of mentor one should at least strive to ""do no harm"". Knives from lawn mower blades, saw blades, leaf Springs and ball bearings are absolutely absurd for a stone beginner to undertake! Real blade steel is far less expensive and safer AND makes a far better knife much easier than unknown, junk yard junk.   It is very probably true that I was less than polite with my words but I really don't like charlatans that intentionally miss guide beginners. Where did the OP even get the idea of making a knife from a file? I admit that it can be done. I know how to do it and I have even done it but it is not easy and it can be dangerous. Why advise a beginner to work with steel that really can not be worked with until it has been annealed for 10 hours in a temperature controlled oven!!? A stick of 1075 knife steel is cheap and readily available and can be made into a knife with the tools found in 90% of the households in the US, Canada and Europe.   Add an aside, I ride motorcycles, I shoot, lift weights and train retrievers. I have found few charlatans in these realms but knife making is fraught with them. They intentionally miss guided me and they are at it yet.   I do regret offending your obviously gentle sensibilities with my strong language but, again, I really don't like charlatans and I consider it a victory every time I snatch a beginner from their clutches. The instruction set that I offered does have the virtue of being direct, simple and safe and for that I do not deplore."

Bladesmith,3c896o,rdeker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:23:19 2015 UTC,"I agree on calling Aldo for steel, and coming to Hype Free to learn.   However, I completely disagree with the sentiment about keeping your mouth shut and just reading at Hype Free. I'm the moderator of the beginners forum there and I encourage people to come and ask questions. You can certainly learn a lot from reading, but it's not always easy for beginners to understand the technical details of the conversations that happen there. If you have a question, and you haven't been able to find an answer, or are looking for better understanding, come ask. You'll get the benefit of responses from some of the best folks in the business. Not just knifemakers, but metallurgists and researchers as well. All that we ask is that folks have the desire and willingness to learn, and be ready to question what they already know.  As to OPs knife, You probably got it a little too hot and caused some scale. It's not the end of the world, and you can redo the heat treatment and probably be just fine. One of the HT demonstrations I do pretty regularly is taking a good quality file of known composition (Nicholson is preferred since I know what steel they are), overheat it to blow up the grain, and then refine it again through proper thermal cycling. To prove it, I snap a piece off of the file  at each step to expose the grain.   You will have to grind through the decarb, but you have to do that with just about any heat treatment. Its important to understand that decarb isn't an ""all or nothing"" issue. Decarburization is a function of atmosphere, time, and temperature. Usually it's only a few thousandths thick.   All of that being said, known steel is cheap in comparison to the time you'll spend working on a knife. It's possible that you started with a good quality file, but you'll likely never know what the steel is (unless you pay to have it tested, which costs $75-100 a pop), so how to heat treat it will always be a crapshoot. Even if you know what it is, files will almost always be a hypereutectoid steel, which can cause problems if you don't know how to properly deal with it, and you need really good temperature control, for extended periods of time, to properly deal with most of those issues.  If you have a simple HT setup, call Aldo for some 1084, use Canola oil (preheated to ~125F) if you can't afford an engineered quenching oil like Parks #50, learn about decalesence and recalesence, and practice. You'll be able to get to 98-99% of the HT potential with that if you're careful and diligent about your processes.  Edit: Feel free to PM me for details on what you'd need to do to re-heat treat the blade. I'd rather not post a ""recipe"" here as there will be questions about your specific setup, what the blade has had done already, etc. that will tailor the answer to your specific case. A ""recipe"" here could likely be re-applied by somebody else in a different situation and cause results they'd be unhappy with, which isn't going to help anybody."

Bladesmith,3c6j30,Alchoholocaustic,10,Sun Jul 5 08:34:06 2015 UTC,"To give you a proper answer, instead of something useless or uninformative(the lazy ""no, do research""), to make knives you need to use a material that can be hardened. As said by /u/thesirenlady the majority of of industry stainless is of a certain variety, which does not lend itself to sufficient hardness for a knife.  On top of this stainless is generally more complex to heat treat than carbon steels. At the cost of proper knife making steel, you might as well buy fresh, known stock. 1084 is fantastically forgiving and AEB-L is a very nice stainless if you don't want carbon.   Take a lot of what you hear on here with a grain of salt, there's some stupid advice at times. General rule of thumb though, thesirenlady, obeythehypnotoad and perfunctificus really know their shit.   There's a lot of other people I've missed that are wonderfully knowledgeable, usually if someone posts bad advice they'll be called out on it."
Bladesmith,3c6j30,allsortsofmeow,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:17:33 2015 UTC,"This pretty much covers the basics, but I have a few additional comments.  If you can't get a forge set up, no need to worry, there are places that you can send blades to be heat treated for you.  Peter's Heat Treat in Meadville, PA is very knifemaker friendly and from all I've heard does good work (I do my own HT, so don't have direct experience).  For steel call Aldo Bruno The New Jersey Steel Baron. He's good people and all he does is sell steel to knifemakers. He could give you additional pointers to heat treaters as well I'm sure."
Bladesmith,3c6j30,rdeker,3,Sun Jul 5 15:14:27 2015 UTC,basically any steel you just find is not going to be suitable to make a knife out of. that goes double for stainless steels. 304 and 316 constitute around 70% of the stainless produced
Bladesmith,3c6j30,thesirenlady,3,Sun Jul 5 09:58:41 2015 UTC,"Not at all. If you are in the US knife steel is cheap, easy to find and very good quality. It costs relatively little of the budget for a knife for the steel so it's worth getting something known, so you know how to heat treat it and get a good result.  Normal ""found steel"" is mild or stainless that isn't designed to be hardened. It doeant have the carbon content. There's a few sources you can use: files, saw blades and leaf springs come to mind. But these are specific and even then, the exact composition is often unknown so it's still going to be a ""gues"" when it comes to critical temperatures and quench medium.  Best get yourself some 1084 stock."

Bladesmith,3c6j30,RDalman,-2,Mon Jul 6 14:57:25 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Read up on it, look at the sidebar."
Bladesmith,3c51fu,A-Grey-World,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:20:14 2015 UTC,"Had the knife in the oven for two cycles at 230C. Verified using a laser themometer (which might not be 100% accurate) Took it out and the part that didn't get heat treated (so no decarb or whatever the black stuff is) is a bright blue.  Doesn't this mean it's reached 300/400C? Pretty sure my oven couldn't even reach that.  I checked the temp multiple times and it was consistent, wasn't cycling much at all. Oven was preheated and temp checked before I put it in. Also I covered the knife with foil (on tray, so there was an air gap) to help stabalise cycling and remove radiative heated from the elements.  So I've no idea why I'm getting blue. Does in heat treated metal go through different colour levels? I notice that kt does go a hint straw coloured before it hits the heat treated part."
Bladesmith,3c51fu,shrikezulu,5,Sat Jul 4 21:25:32 2015 UTC,"If you are using a convection oven, then yes it can get that hot. When your oven is coming up to temp, the interior can wildly vary in temp. You can get hot spots that will over temper the steel. Best bet is to turn your oven on, and then let it sit for at least 30 minutes so the interior temps can even out before you put your knife in. Baring any contaminants on the steel, temper colors are accurate.  See black body radiation. EDIT  The black body thing is not true, see ColinDavies correction of me.  most appreciated."
Bladesmith,3c51fu,ColinDavies,7,Sat Jul 4 23:30:53 2015 UTC,"Temper colours have nothing to do with black body radiation.  They are caused by thin film interference.  The correspondence with temperature happens because the thickness of the oxide layer increases as you go hotter (until it is so thick that it becomes totally opaque and you see no more colours).  It should still be consistent for the same steel, surface prep, and temperature.  It is time dependent initially but after a while it will level off to a particular equilibrium thickness for a given temperature."
Bladesmith,3c51fu,shrikezulu,5,Sun Jul 5 01:04:17 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks for the correction /u/ColinDavies."
Bladesmith,3c51fu,rdeker,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:02:27 2015 UTC,So going to have to re-heat treat then?
Bladesmith,3c51fu,wkirbys,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:08:39 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Oxide colors can vary widely and shouldn't be counted on as an accurate measure of tempering temps. Steel alloy, surface contaminants, and atmosphere all play a role in the oxidation, so you could have two blades in the same oven and get different colors on them.  You didn't say what the steel or heat treatment was either. Some steels require higher tempering temps anyways, so you may be just fine.   That said, home ovens can tend to be inaccurate on temperatures and have wild swings in heat as they try to maintain temperature hysteresis because they're not using very sensitive temperature probes and are often regulated by simple, cheap, mechanical systems.  A few tips to help minimize this:   Get some bricks, or a pizza stone, or something to add a lot of thermal mass. Put them in the oven and then bring it to temp. The extra thermal mass will help stabilize the temperature. Get an inexpensive thermocouple setup and use it to measure the actual temps right next to the blade in the oven. Test to see how close it is (they all vary some) by measuring the temp in a pot of boiling water (212F/100C) and a glass of ice with a little bit of water in it (32F/0C). Trust the thermocouple, not your oven. You'll have a much better idea of your actual temps then. A lot of multimeters that you can get at the hardware store can read a K-type thermocouple, just look for one that has a ""temperature"" setting. Here is an example.   Edit: Forgot to mention steel type and HT"
Bladesmith,3c51fu,allsortsofmeow,2,Sun Jul 5 15:24:19 2015 UTC,"I found the same thing, I tempered some O1, oven set to 190, measured at 200 highest with external thermocouple yet the colour was beyond blue. I just figured tempering colours are not all that accurate."
Bladesmith,3c51fu,allsortsofmeow,2,Sat Jul 4 23:18:29 2015 UTC,"Only tempering colours are -very- accurate.  Edit: As shown by rdeker, I was way fucking off. Apologies."
Bladesmith,3c51fu,rdeker,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:16:23 2015 UTC,So it's fucked and I'm going to have to re-heat treat?
Bladesmith,3c51fu,ColinDavies,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:07:51 2015 UTC,"I can't answer that one, I'm relatively new to things. As long as your blade didn't temper too soft you should be okay in my estimate. (appears to just be the handle in the picture?)"
Bladesmith,3c46mb,A-Grey-World,2,Sat Jul 4 16:39:12 2015 UTC,"I've done exactly what your doing with o1 and I think you're good. I've got a few knives out in the wild and haven't heard of any issues yet. The YouTube vids I've watched suggest preheating to prevent warping. I am by no means an expert, but as an amateur  with a few years and blades under my belt I don't see any issues with what you're  doing.  As the other person pointed out, more precise tools are always preferred and I wouldn't consider anything I do half assed due to lack of more precise tools. There's plenty of people starting out with exactly my set-up and yours and they are doing just fine."
Bladesmith,3c46mb,dirtymunke,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:56:44 2015 UTC,"Depends on the oil. What were you using, and what was the temperature in the shop?  In most cases with oils, the reason to preheat is the viscosity reasoning. At a lower viscosity, convection currents can more easily move hot oil away from the interface with the blade. That being said, you should be agitating the blade in the quench anyway, which not only help this, but also helps break up the vapor jacket that forms around the blade during quench.  Now, after all of that, I'd refer you to my comments in another thread that talk about using O1 without good heat process controls."
Bladesmith,3c46mb,rdeker,-8,Sun Jul 5 15:42:45 2015 UTC,Ok you write horribly but O1 requires a medium speed oil so room temp canola (if that's what you're using) is correct to begin with.
Bladesmith,3c46mb,obeythehypnotoad,3,Sat Jul 4 21:13:38 2015 UTC,"Great, I was using vegetable oil. I'd always read to preheat it."
Bladesmith,3c46mb,obeythehypnotoad,-8,Sat Jul 4 21:26:26 2015 UTC,"Well it depends on the steel.   With the crudeness of your temperature control the oil temp is probably the least of your concerns. Get some better equipment, knife making is too time consuming to half ass."
Bladesmith,3c46mb,obeythehypnotoad,6,Sat Jul 4 22:13:10 2015 UTC,Plenty of people use a two brick forge. What do you suggest as an alternative? I can't afford to sink thousands into a hobby.
Bladesmith,3c46mb,doublesecretprobatio,0,Sat Jul 4 22:57:13 2015 UTC,I know little about forges but I believe adding crude temperature control isn't that expensive.

Bladesmith,3c1ax0,reali-tglitch,2,Sat Jul 4 00:41:46 2015 UTC,"You know, i haven't done much personal field testing to see if it helps in corrosion resistance. But I feel with stainless steels such as S90 it's purely for looks.  As i've left this steel wet for a few days without getting much if not any surface rust. It took about 4 hours for 100% ferric chloride to even darken the steel past a grey color LOL  It definitely, if anything, gives a great finish that people wont be afraid of using while being more nonreflective and a little more tractical than satin or standard stonewashing."
Bladesmith,3c1ax0,Scubawookie,2,Sat Jul 4 04:26:57 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't even realize S90V was stainless. I'm not as familiar with the stainless grades, but I'd really like to start using them soon.   Wow 4 hours? That's crazy.

Bladesmith,3c1ax0,Stimming,2,Sat Jul 4 13:08:56 2015 UTC,"Lol yeah it's a crazy stainless steel, and I believe S110V is supposed to be even better in terms of toughness and corrosion resistance. It was such a pain to acid wash I actual just threw it in there while I played Xbox haha. Come out and wash/scrub it in, rinse, oil, repeat like 4 times. Took a lot to get it darker than a light grey.  Carbon and tool steels take... about 15 seconds to a few minutes at most. So the contrast is insane haha"

Highly toxic to the lungs, and one heck of an irritant to the skin, eyes, and lungs.        If you manage to get composite powder on your open skin, always flush it out with soap and warm water. Using cold water will just close up your pores and lock the nastiness in your skin.   If you get a splinter, it needs to be cut out. Pulling it out leaves little micro-barbs embedded in your skin, which will irritate you and most likely become an infected spot.

And you're welcome for the prior concern. I absolutely love working with carbon fiber, but knowing the dangers of it, I like to make sure people know what they're getting in to with it.

Bladesmith,3bxfe8,MotoEnduro,4,Thu Jul 2 23:48:20 2015 UTC,"I'd go with a jig saw over a hack saw. Just set it for little or no orbit, and make sure the motor doesn't get too hot. If the case starts feeling toasty, take a break and let it cool down. Get the best metal cutting blade you can find."
Bladesmith,3bxfe8,kenofthesea,2,Thu Jul 2 23:58:21 2015 UTC,"I've never tried a jigsaw for long cuts through steel, but I guess it could be done. You're probably going to burn through some blades though. One of the advantages of a bandsaw is the travel time of the blade before it contacts the work piece again. So you may want to periodically cool your steel, and maybe the jigsaw blade as well by dipping in water. Just don't dunk your saw."
Bladesmith,3bxfe8,boomboom4132,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:27:27 2015 UTC,cutting oil would be better would also help wash away some of the filings but take it slow and if the oil starts to smoke allot let everything cool down for a min
Bladesmith,3bxfe8,rdeker,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:28:57 2015 UTC,"I agree that lubrication would be required for using something like a jig saw.

Bladesmith,3bxfe8,free_will_is_arson,2,Thu Jul 9 22:23:07 2015 UTC,"do you mean for cutting out the entire design on the blank or just lopping off a piece of steel from some flat bar. personally it sounds a lot easier to just use a hacksaw to cut off a piece from the bar and then use a bench grinder to rough out the shape. i've never used one for this application but i would also assume that since a jigsaw reciprocates and all you have by way of resistance is whatever body weight you can put on the saw, it's going to jump a lot and possibly fuck up the blade, saw, steel or all three. do you have anything by way of a grinder/belt sander."
Bladesmith,3bxfe8,MotoEnduro,4,Fri Jul 3 00:35:07 2015 UTC,"Jig saws cut on the up stroke, so it pulls the tool against the workpiece, transferring the force of the blade down through the baseplate."

Bladesmith,3btz81,Fargraven,2,Thu Jul 2 03:22:06 2015 UTC,Lawnmower blade?  Lawnmower blade.   Rumor has it that most modern lawnmower blades are no longer made from high carbon stock because the litigious state of California determined that it is the manufacturer's  fault when someone mows over a rock and causes the blade to shatter. Now they are low carbon alloy steel heat treated to produce a bainitic grain structure.
Bladesmith,3btz81,TorchForge,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:54:45 2015 UTC,But I thought low carbon steel cannot be heat treated?
Bladesmith,3btz81,TorchForge,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:45:51 2015 UTC,"You absolutely can heat treat low carbon steels. Anything that is hypoeutectic (less than 0.77 carbon or so) will form lath martensite upon quenching but it might not produce martensite grain structure uniformly throughout the steel. Hypereutectic steels will form plate martensite uniformly throughout the steel, which is harder but more brittle than lath martensite. Of course, depending on heat treatment quality you might have other grain structures like retained austenite/ferrite/cementite/other carbides.    10B38 is a boron alloy that has low carbon and is commonly used in modern lawnmowers. Boron adds toughness and the steel is heat treated to produce bainitic structures instead of martensite."

Brownells Acraglass is another leading product. Though you will get good results from the more commonly available devcon, so long as you prep correctly. and thats really the key in all cases. sandblasting is the ideal way to do it. otherwise you can do what west system recommends, applying some epoxy to the steel and 'wet sanding' with it. this ensure the epoxy is bonded with the steel instead of the naturally forming oxide layer."

Bladesmith,3bmbcf,BlueReaper46,2,Tue Jun 30 11:08:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert by any means, but I have a few ideas. For one, if it is hardened steel, profiling and shaping a blade isn't really going to be possible with a file and dremel. However, you should be able to anneal it if you have access to a forge (hot fire/torch). After shaping, you could send them out for heat treat to Peter's or wherever.  If you really have no option to anneal/heat treat, I'd say you are kind of out of luck probably."
Bladesmith,3bmbcf,on_the_nightshift,3,Tue Jun 30 11:28:05 2015 UTC,You would probably have to sacrifice quite a bit to figure out which process to use since it's an unknown stainless. I imagine it'd be cheaper to just buy some flat stock.
Bladesmith,3bmbcf,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,4,Tue Jun 30 15:23:37 2015 UTC,"IMO, yes its a waste of time.  the file wont work at all. you wont be able to drill holes for the handle with any ease. You cant really anneal stainless in a gas forge. even if they're good steel, it'll be relatively cheap anyway. they use 440C and 12C27 for skates, both very affordable steel"
Bladesmith,3bmbcf,thesirenlady,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:01:10 2015 UTC,"i guess you can, as like a 'whatever' project, but im guessing that it will be a couple months of slow, punishing, work. you'll go days thinking that your work hasn't had any effect on the steel and the faster you try to speed up the work the more likely you'll overheat the steel and mess with the heat treat (or out right burn the steel), which means you'll have to re-heat treat it. but if you're set up for that than you might as well just anneal it in the first place.   a forge would make all the difference here and i think that's the 'go/no go' sticking point. that kid who forged drill bits didn't have much problem (mind you, with a different kind of steel)."
Bladesmith,3bmbcf,free_will_is_arson,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:35:28 2015 UTC,"Pease choose another steel that is annealed already. Then you can use hand tools and send it off for heat treat.

Bladesmith,3bk2w0,Fargraven,2,Tue Jun 30 21:42:23 2015 UTC,Amazing. I'm actually planning on trying aluminum bolsters for the first time on my next blade. Do you have any general tips for them? My friend tried them once and he had trouble shaping them and removing material
Bladesmith,3bk2w0,reservedthought,3,Mon Jun 29 22:20:17 2015 UTC,"Aluminum? I've done a set of scales for a straight razor with aluminum. Here are the issues I ran across - When cutting that metal, it heats quick and likes to melt into your abrasive. So, to start, if your using a chop saw, grab an old blade and use that, not a new one. It will gum up the blade. Ideally, cutting the rough stock with a band saw is best. From there, as your shaping, if you have a belt sander, again, use worn belts. The aluminum will stick to the grit as you cut it. Another trick I figured out was to not run the sander at max speed. Gets very hot, very fast! Try a medium speed. Last but not least, there are a bunch of different types of aluminum out there. I would go with something like 7075. That grade is recommended for machinists building small parts. - Hope this helps and post some pics when you're done!!"

Bladesmith,3bllcc,squid_tree,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:00:04 2015 UTC,"I'd heat it to cherry red, and just quench it. Don't bother with tempering, as all you're doing there is taking away hardness in trade for toughness. Since it's an unknown alloy what I've heard in multiple videos and read from a variety of sources is to start with an oil quench (warmed, and any cooking oil is better then motor oil) then test for hardness. If your desired hardness isn't met then quench with warm water. The reason for this order as I understand it is that an oil quench steel will crack in water while a water quench steel does OK in oil."
Bladesmith,3bllcc,obeythehypnotoad,3,Tue Jun 30 11:41:38 2015 UTC,"Don't bother with tempering, as all you're doing there is taking away hardness in trade for toughness.    This is not true.  After hardening the steel is full of martensite and is under quite a bit of stress.  It's a matter of time before it cracks on its own.  This is why when you look at tempering data for steels they usually say something like ""temper immediately"".  You can temper at a low temperatures... say, 250F, but you must temper."

Bladesmith,3blhpn,Eclectix,3,Tue Jun 30 04:42:55 2015 UTC,"I can explain how to do it to you, but it's a bit involved. I happen to do this professionally, among other things, so message me if you want details.  There are several ways to go about it depending on the specific blade, but the gist of it is you want to establish a base line to work from, either the cutting edge or the back side, again depending on the blade, welt that side of the scabbard, then run the blade in and out against the welting while tracing the the blade as it moves up and down to establish your other line.  Send me a pic of the blade and i'll describe how it's fitted in much greater detail."

Bladesmith,3blhpn,fluffy-d-wolf,3,Wed Jul 1 18:55:36 2015 UTC,"Okay, now that I can see your blade, which looks good so far BTW, I'd go about it:  I'm assuming a wooden scabbard for the purpose of these directions, since that's what I mostly make. The steps for a leather sheath are similar for the layout part.   First, trace the blade as close as you can all the way around on your backing material Next, glue down the welting along the blade side starting from past the tip of the blade all the way to past where the crossguard will be Then, glue down the welting for the back side, but only going about two inches past where you have your mark for the false edge on the back side When your welting is setup, dried, and firmly in place, set the blade down into the welting to ensure you have a good fit. The welting should be nice and snug along both sides Now, put your hand or a piece of wood or other stiff material over the tip part of the blade so that it can't come up from between the welting and slowly pull the blade out. As it goes it will want to pull away a bit from the welting at the edge side, that's exactly what you want it to do. pull the blade out an inch at a time at each interval, retrace where the back side of the blade is, all the way until you have the tip free of the partial welting on the back side. This line will now be your new backside line where the rest of the welting will go in. The mouth of your scabbard will be wider than the blade a bit, there's noting to be done for this except making an open back scabbard, in which case you'd already have all the welting you'd need for the blade. Now lay the rest of the welting along your new line, then test the blade for fit and easy of drawing the blade out. If it binds a bit, you can shave the inside of the welting or peel it off and re-lay it to adjust the fit.        I'm assuming you have the basic construction of wood, metal, or leather scabbards down, if not, feel free to ask, I'll help you with what I can."
Bladesmith,3blhpn,fluffy-d-wolf,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:23:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this is very helpful. Most of my experience is with leather, but I'm planning on making this scabbard with a wood core and finishing it with a leather cover. I'm pretty sure I have a decent understanding of your directions. I'll be sure to post updates as I go along. This is very much a learning process for me."
Bladesmith,3blhpn,BrokenCrw,2,Thu Jul 2 00:00:13 2015 UTC,"Anytime.  If you're going to do a wood core, make the scabbard backing longer past the guard end than it needs to be so you can cut it down to fit later on.  It's always better to be too long than too short."

To me theres no aspect of 'cheating' involved. it is the simplest part of the knifemaking process. a monkey with a hacksaw could profile a blade, so why not outsource it?  But I wouldnt hire anyone to do shit without telling me an actual price. You might not think it'll take that long but does that factor in the time it takes for them to prep the machine? figure out their cutting specs for the material? The bloke in the office CADing or Re-CADing your files?  I use a waterjet service to cut out blades and handles for framelock folding knives. the benefit being that the holes are located and the lockbar can be cut in a nice curve. Ive never had it done for a fixed blade and unless i was making 20+ of them I wouldnt bother.  Dont count on it being being precise enough to give you sharp or pretty teeth. they're not that deep, just do em with a hand file."

Bladesmith,3bkvyu,FJ1906,2,Tue Jun 30 02:08:25 2015 UTC,Some chainsaw files would make pretty quick work putting in the saw back. They come in different sizes so you can find the one to match the size and pitch of the saw teeth.
Bladesmith,3bkvyu,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:03:01 2015 UTC,Can you give me an example of a chainsaw file?  I found a few on Amazon but I'm not sure if they are the ones you are talking about?
Bladesmith,3bkvyu,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:06:34 2015 UTC,"Just simple round files. They usually come in sizes 3/16"", 5/32"", and 7/32"" Here"
Bladesmith,3bkvyu,nohotpocketforu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:39:15 2015 UTC,For the saw back my plan was the bevel the area to the point where it's probably 1/8 of an inch thick down from a quarter inch.  Then create the teeth.  Thoughts?

Bladesmith,3bgf3d,DaveTheCripple,5,Mon Jun 29 00:19:01 2015 UTC,Have you watched the YouTube channel from Walter Sorrells? He has some great advice and techniques for grinding with a belt.
Bladesmith,3bgf3d,IAmAPhysicsGuy,3,Mon Jun 29 03:52:37 2015 UTC,"This is a problem I had when I first began.   At the end of the day, it seems like a lot of work, but there are certain things to keep in mind.   If you don't mind my asking, are you left handed by chance? It looks to me like the right side of the blade is off because you're not totally comfortable grinding with both hands yet.   Keep in mind, it's not just the angle of the grind that dictates having a nice grind, it's also depth control. And of course, the plunges. Well, say for example you are trying to get no frills 90 degree plunges, straight up and down. Well, while you have to adjust the angle to bring your grind up, you also have to be certain that you are holding the knife 90 for straight plunges, while making sure to not wander into the ricaso, whilst adjusting angle for your flat grinds. To me, it looks like your angle varies when you put the knife on the flat platten and that's how you're ending up with the uneven plunges. You might be tweaking it to the sides a bit and that gives you that rounded plunge, or you're starting too far back. It helps to sharpie or dye the area that is your starting area for your plunge, so that while you work with the knife edge up, you can see exactly where you're supposed to stop, and it allows you to cut in further with confidence.   Now that being said, if your belt is tracking off more one side or the other, that can cause the belt to dig in asymmetrically and while not impossible, makes your job a lot harder to get perfect plunges.   Personally, I like to start at a highish angle, 40-45 degrees, make some nice notches into the plunge by cutting straight in, this way the plunges themselves help to prevent me from wandering into the ricaso, and sort of guide the belt into giving me clean plunges.   Another thing, and I did this a whole bunch as a suggestion from another maker awhile back, is to start on the side of the blade you feel least comfortable with. If you get a good grind on the side of the blade (Your off hand) you're least comfortable with, it'll then be easier to match that grind with the side you are comfortable grinding, your dominant hand.   Someone recommended Walter Sorrels, really terrific video, he may explain some things more clearly than I am, I'm running on no sleep so forgive me if some of the things I'm saying don't make perfect sense. :P"
Bladesmith,3bgf3d,Valencourtcustom,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:19:45 2015 UTC,"Good call. I am left handed.  I will have to try that out, working with the ""bad"" side first. additionally I'll try that idea of starting at a high angle to get dug in deep at the plunge. In this particular case, I was utilizing the common bolt through angle iron jig. In the meantime I might even try establishing a plunge free hand, then switch to a jig to keep the subsequent tracking even.  Do you think there is anything I can do to ""salvage"" the grind on the offside now? I suppose I can just bring it up to a full flat grind to hide it all."
Bladesmith,3bgf3d,Valencourtcustom,3,Mon Jun 29 12:34:05 2015 UTC,"Good call. I am left handed.   I had a feeling, my good grinds are on that side and I'm a righty, lol.   Yeah I dunno, I've never been good with jigs, oddly. I've always done everything free hand, myself. So I couldn't begin to tell you where you might be off with a jig.   I think if you were really careful, you could salvage it aesthetically. In terms of its function, plunges aren't necessary to make a good, functional knife. You could, with some very straight, careful plunges, salvage the aesthetics. But seeing as there is a choil right next to the area where the grind creeped into, you have to be very precise, you have very little room to work with.   If it were me, I'd probably start the plunge very slightly behind or right at the the end of the choil, just to give myself more room, but that's me.   Out of curiosity, you're using an angle iron jig you said? If the blade is truly being held the same for grinding on both sides, then it's a matter of you putting the knife on the platten too far back on one side, which is why your plunge is further back. You'll also notice how it sort of curves up, that means the contact you're making is just enough that you're getting varied heights, and so it creates that curve (Basically, little contact towards the back nearest the choil, and more as you approach the blade).  I'm willing to bet if you used the dig, but were much more mindful of where the plunges are, you'd get better results. But I do think you could salvage that knife."

Bladesmith,3bgf3d,allsortsofmeow,2,Mon Jun 29 01:37:19 2015 UTC,I reuploaded the album. Hopefully it works
Bladesmith,3bf3kd,TypicalCricket,5,Sun Jun 28 17:31:57 2015 UTC,"Rockwell testing is the way the hardness of your steel. There are different scales, but blades generally use the C scale (denoted as HRC). Commonly blades vary between 50-60 HRC and the hardness you want depends on the properties you want your knife to have. If your knives are going to be used in the wilderness it may be better to not make them super crazy hard (they would be more brittle and prone to damage).  Stabilizing is commonly done with burl and exotic hardwoods to improve workability and mitigate movement. Different woods respond differently to stabilization. Hickory and oak and the like are pretty solid and don't generally need stabilization. Just make sure they are nice and dry and seal them once they're shaped and finished."
Bladesmith,3bf3kd,kingswee,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:47:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips! So should I aim for about 50 HRC to keep it grom getting too brittle?
Bladesmith,3bf3kd,platypod,7,Sun Jun 28 18:08:56 2015 UTC,"You will find most small, high quality knives in the 58 - 62 HRC range. 50 HRC would be a soft, very durable edge, like a cheap axe head. It would require frequent sharpening."
Bladesmith,3bf3kd,kingswee,3,Sun Jun 28 20:09:47 2015 UTC,That's a question for someone more knowledgeable than I. I don't work with stainless and I don't know the demands put on camp/bushcraft knives so I'm not an authority. If you do some googling you will probably find better info.
Bladesmith,3bf3kd,obeythehypnotoad,3,Sun Jun 28 18:13:34 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of using 440C Stainless   440c is a fine steel but probably best to start out with a simpler steel.  My vote is O-1, followed by 1095.  They perform well and the material is cheap and easy to work.   And what hardness do I want    Since you're outsourcing the heat treatment all you need to worry about is what hardness you want.  A simple way to choose the hardness is to find a knife model with similar geometry, steel,  and intended usage and look up what its spec'd hardness is.  For an outdoors knife I'm guessing that's going to be mid to high 50's.   don't mention anything about having to stabilize anything   Some woods really need to be stabilized, some don't, and some it's debatable.  Before you get too wigged out about handle stabilization just remember that 100 years ago nobody vacuum impregnated wood with epoxy."
Bladesmith,3bf3kd,StandForMe,3,Mon Jun 29 15:49:01 2015 UTC,"As far as stabilization goes, it isn't that big of a deal. If you cant dent it with your fingernail, it should be good. Red oak is not really a great choice, since the pores are so big. Keep it dry, and I always recommend boiled linseed oil, as it drys hard and seals the pores at the surface to prevent bacteria build up. Plus it brings out the color well."
Bladesmith,3bf3kd,seggy4,3,Mon Jun 29 16:03:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I'll do some experimenting with the various wood types I have lying around.
Bladesmith,3bf3kd,obeythehypnotoad,2,Mon Jun 29 16:24:06 2015 UTC,"I use that same company to buy most of my steels and heat treating when I can't do it myself and they do a great job.  I wouldn't recommend 440c,in my experience it was a mediocre knife steel at best, but I also hate all stainless,  it is a bitch to work with and doesn't perform the same, however if you wanted stainless I am told S30V is very good, although I have never personally tried it.   For rockwell testing, it is basically just a testing of the hardness of the blade, it's not vital to have done, and often declined since it is technically a destructive test, but the damage is minimal and easily hidden under a handle, or depending how good they do sanded out in a few seconds,  however that is not with my experience from Canadian knife maker. Rockwell testing can give information on how well the knife will perform.  as for the desired hardness that depends on the steel used, and there are a few places to find that on the Internet, I use zknives.Com alot, but you can just ask Canadian knife maker what they recommend and they should be able to help you with it.   And lastly the handles you don't need to worry to much about stabilizing woods as it is so small not alot can happen to it and if it's scraps they likely won't have much left to have done since I'm assuming they have sat long enough they are likely pretty much used to the climate.   Sorry about the shitty formatting I'm on mobile and at work If you have any follow up questions feel free to ask"
Bladesmith,3bf3kd,free_will_is_arson,2,Sun Jun 28 17:54:12 2015 UTC,Properly heat treated 440c is a perfectly good stainless steel.  As far as stainless goes it's probably a good steel to start with and use as a baseline.  But he should just start with O-1 or 1095.
Bladesmith,3bf3kd,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:42:03 2015 UTC,"i'll help with what i can. for an outdoorsman knife i would suggest starting with 1084, better specialized for harder use tasks and the heat treat is really simple, none of that foil wrap and plate quench stuff just heat it to temp and quench. you'll have to do some research on the type of steel you're using to know if a double or triple temper is needed (though i don't think you'll need any more than a double with 1084), and rockwell is a system for determining the new relative hardness of the steel after heat treat & temper, typically shoot for a 58-60 RHC. the higher the number the harder the steel has become, but also more brittle, so be careful. as for stabilized woods, it will give you more longevity out of your handles but really only moderately so, especially for something that's going to be getting such hard use as a 'camp' knife will. it's not necessary, but it is an available option that can give you some unique products, should you so choose to go that route. personally, a hard wood with a something like a gun stock coating with is just fine.   hope this helps, im sure others will be along who know better than i do."
Bladesmith,3be1sx,Szervetlen,2,Sun Jun 28 09:56:08 2015 UTC,"This turned out a bit wierd.  It was supposed to be a fileting knife, but I have a feeling the point is waay to agressive. This type of knife should probably also have some more shape to the handle to prevent slipping and cutting yourself, i tried rounding the bottom part of the blade but it didn't really help. The handle is also super long. All in all i think it looks more like a very thin nordic seax than a proper kitchen knife.  The wood is flame birch and I was honestly expecting a little bit more activity and color."

Bladesmith,3bdq5z,Verrence,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:07:33 2015 UTC,"You do want something hard, though the file doesnt really give you a terribly flat surface, the teeth are going to influence where the paper is actually cutting. My favorite block is a piece of G10 with a slant on one side. Cross section like this. the angle allows that edge to get into the plunge line. and by gripping the paper against the slant its tightening it as you hold."

Looks like your fullering tool worked out well.   One suggestion for the future; an easy way to clean up the inside of your fuller to make it a bit more even is using chainsaw files., cut them short if you have too. Start with the narrowest one, and work your way up. You can preserve the side slope profile while making it more even, then finish with sandpaper.  I'm really liking your guard and pommel, most people don't take the time to forge theirs, so well done there! Well designed and execution, very nice!  The only suggestion/criticism I'd really give is on your handle where it meets the guardl. Looks like you drilled it out to the width of the tang leaving much more space on the flat sides and leaving that gap on either side of the guard.   There's a few good ways to avoid that that are easy to do. One is to drill the hole only the size of the thickness of the tang, then before you heat treat the blade, heat the tang to a dull cherry read and force it through the hole, it will burn out the exact shape of the tang giving you a great fit and no slop space.  Another is to get yourself a decent rotary too, think Prodigy or Fordham, not Dremel. Drill you hole again to the thickness of the tang, then use a Rotozip bit in your rotary tool to widen it. Rotozip bits are worth their weight in gold for this!  Again, very well done! It's a beautiful piece and you should be proud of your efforts!  EDIT: I accidently a word"

When you just look for scales, it will be expensive. just looking on ebay, searching for rosewood, I found  2.75 by 19 by .375 for a brazilian rosewood piece designed to be used for guitars for 54 dollars. That is probably enough for many knives.   If you are only ever going to make a single knife handle, I don't know what to say. Expensive woods in small pieces are expensive."

If your handles are a bit bigger you might only get 4 out of it but you would still have the short piece for a smaller knife or knife with a bolster.  Either way $2-3 per set of scales."

Massive and ip65 rated.  I have used many motors like this one running off VFDs like this one and have no reason to buy anything else for the machinery i build and the duty i submit them to. Give that motor supplier a call as well, they should stock a lighter duty motor of the same hp for about $110."

I always ask people to consider the kind of use they will subject their equipment to when they want to buy real heavy duty stuff. added up, how long do you think you will use the grinder per week? between 1 and 5 hours? those kinds of boxes are built to run all day, you just dont need the industriousness"

Bladesmith,3awaiq,usernamewillendabrup,21,Wed Jun 24 00:41:01 2015 UTC,"I'll give this a shot and see if I can explain it.  The edge of a blade is very thin. When it sees abuse, or just a lot of use, it's going to deform in some way or another. There are two typical ways this happens. One is chipping out, which is where small (often times microscopic) bits of the blade edge fracture and fall off of the blade edge. This is especially true of blades that were heat treated for maximum hardness.  The second wear/deformation case is the so called ""rolling"" of the edge. This is when the edge is more ductile than brittle and literally folds over on itself. To get a large-sized visualization of this, grab a piece of tin foil, hold it a little taut (not tight)  at the edge, and press it down against something. Since aluminium is a very ductile material, it will tend to fold over on itself at the edge. It will also crinkle up in this example, but that's because the foil is all the same thickness. In a knife blade, you have a very fine edge that then angles outwards as you go higher up the blade. This extra mass of material directly behind the edge will support it and keep it from crinkling. What happens in this case, since the edge can't crinkle up into the blade is it will pick one direction or the other to fold and ""roll over"" to one side.  The reason that you (generally) hear of blades either chipping OR rolling, but not both is due to the steel type and the heat treatment. As bladesmiths we have a constant point of compromise in heat treatment with regards to hardness and toughness. Hard will take a very keen edge, but by its nature a hard steel will be brittle and prone to fracture before deforming. You can increase ""toughness"" by tempering higher and softening the steel to reduce brittleness, but then it will deform rather than fracture. The real trick of heat treatment is being able to control this to meet the needs of the application."
Bladesmith,3awaiq,rdeker,5,Wed Jun 24 01:20:42 2015 UTC,This is a pretty good explanation.
Bladesmith,3awaiq,AutoKill45,5,Wed Jun 24 02:01:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I forgot to mention one important thing about rolled edges and knife care. When you see a chef or a butcher using a ""sharpening steel"" on a knife, they're generally not actually ""sharpening"" in the common sense of removing material from the edge. The sharpening steel (if used properly) is actually ""unrolling"" a rolled edge. You can't do this infinitely, you still need to actually use abrasives and resharpen a dull knife. However, if you're only cutting soft things like meat (and staying away from the bones) you can quickly ""refresh"" the edge with a few strokes on the steel. You'll notice that a good butcher will do this after every few cuts they make.  Edit: I can't type"
Bladesmith,3awaiq,rdeker,3,Wed Jun 24 02:39:39 2015 UTC,"This is the difference between ""honing"" and ""sharpening"". Sharpening is, as you said, removing material from the edge. Honing is simply realigning the edge."

I could hammer the copper pins a bit down so they expanded and filled the hole almost completely. I also didn't find a good way to give the micarta a nice finish, since it is still quite rough now and I don't have a buffing wheel or something alike"

If you want it to look like glass, coat it in several thin layers of superglue, letting it dry and lightly sanding in between coats, then take it up the grits.  3M polishing papers work well if you don't have a buffer.  It's a lot of work, but it can look nice.  Can make most everything glassy, including wood.  This is one I did with homemade micarta and a superglue finish.  You can also fill those holes around the pins with a superglue.  Save some dust from sanding the micarta or get some similar-color dye, mix it with some superglue or epoxy into a paste, fill the holes, then sand them flush (you can also just fill it with superglue and sand it, but the dust+glue or dye+glue mix will match better)."

Bladesmith,3aqwrd,reservedthought,4,Mon Jun 22 19:58:03 2015 UTC,"I actually bought a can of that same wood hardener when I started doing some scales. It is more so designed to help rotted wood on decks and the like, not for stabilizing wood. Have fun stabilizing that at home, because from what I understand, it is truly a pain in the ass process to do it properly.  That being said, there was once a time where knife handles werent ever stabilized, and knife handles havae been around for ever. Stabilized wood or exotic wood is a simply a higher tier  material. If it is fairly hard, it should not move if you keep it clean and dry. Is it a humid enviornment? If not, use whatever. I have not used maple burl, though standard maple doesnt really have all that wide of pores, so I assume it should be alright. With a kitchen knife, your real issue is bacteria. A stabilized wood handle has it's pores filled with sealant, so no problem. This is still a problem for other woods. The solution to this, is to finish with boiled linseed oil. Unlike other oil based finishes, it dries completely hard. Excellent for sealing those surface pores and for keeping it from collecting bacteria, plus it brings out the color very well.  Desert Ironwood, bocote, cocobolo, and rosewoods dont really respond to stabilization, and arent really going to move ever, especially ironwood and cocobolo.  Other exotic hardwoods are more likely to, some less than others to a varying degree. The real facror is enviornmental and level of care. If you want the absolutly best product, get already stabilized wood, or desert ironwood or cocobolo. I personally like cocobolo, since it is a bit easier to work with, though that is personal preference. Maple burl will work just fine, just dont leave it in a pudd le or keep it in an unnecessarily humid enviornment, finish with boiled linseed oil, and you should be good.

Bladesmith,3aqwrd,Weebus,2,Tue Jun 23 01:38:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of minwax and other hardeners personally.  I don't love all the solvents they put in them... some aren't exactly safe around food.  If I go unstabilized, I prefer Rosewoods or other equally oily woods... those you can just take to a high grit finish and maybe some mineral oil + beeswax mix (same stuff I use on my cutting boards) to maintain it.  You can use other less oily unstabilized woods like Maple in the kitchen as well.  It just needs a little more care to get a nice finish that will last.    Take it to a nice finish (~800 grit+), get some pure tung oil (food safe, no added solvents), and give it a good coating.  Rub it in down with super fine/#0000 steel wool to help it penetrate into the pores of the wood for few minutes, then wipe off the excess oil and let it dry for a day.  Repeat until it stops absorbing more oil, then give it a final buff with the steel wool.  That'll seal up the pores and give it a nice looking, hard finish.  Also, I just posted about it in another thread, but a superglue finish is another option to seal up natural wood.  Use the extra thin stuff or thin it yourself and put on ~20 REALLY thin coats.  Polish it up and it'll look nice and glossy.  Do practice first before using it on a knife."
Bladesmith,3aqwrd,Weebus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:21:25 2015 UTC,"I saw your comment and a couple other people mentioning superglue finish. I need to experiment much more but I think I prefer the wood-grain handfeel rather than a glossy feel of polished CA.  I read this article which goes into the differences between BLO and Tung oil as does this video. I think I'll go with BLO and vacuum to maximize penetration. If I use Tung I'm afraid it won't cure properly due to lack of oxygen access deep in the pores, which further lengthens its already rather long cure time. BLO has metal catalysts which at least would be better than pure Tung in terms of cure time."
Bladesmith,3aqwrd,kingswee,2,Wed Jun 24 05:47:41 2015 UTC,"I've used both.  Tung oil does take longer to cure, but it doesn't have the dangers associated with BLO, so it's my preference.  Plus I prefer the look/feel of the finish to that of BLO (minor a difference as it may be).  So long as you're not putting too thick of coats on, Tung doesn't have any issues curing though.  Trick is to go thin... I think that's where people who have issues slip up.  I leave both overnight and just do a coat or two a day (usually 3-4 coats at most)... so the difference between a 10 and 15 (or whatever it ends up being) cure time doesnt make a difference to me.  Use whatever you'd like, though but just be sure to take proper precautions to ensure you aren't putting yourself or your customers in danger."
Bladesmith,3aqwrd,ben_chapleski,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:11:29 2015 UTC,"So I went to the store and had a choice between BLO and Minwax Tung oil protective finish. I have some chem background so was interested in the MSDS of the two.  The MSDS for BLO contains predictably linseed oil (>90% weight) and some organocobalt based catalyst (0.2% weight). What surprised me was that the Minwax Tung oil finish also contained organocobalt (0.2% weight) and 65 % weight of solvent, with the remaining 35ish% weight unspecified...  So... best case scenario I suppose the 35% left is tung oil, and not some kind of varnish (polymerized oils?) I've been warned about I guess.  Both of the MSDS have similar language due to cobalt content, but seems harmless enough. I ended up getting the tung oil as suggested. Thanks again!  Edit: Nevermind, found the proper MSDS from the supplying company of the BLO (Recochem), they also add zirconium based catalysts, seems. Although there still doesn't seem to be significant health risks associated with it in the MSDS, I suppose it's one more thing to worry about. Glad I went with the Tung.  Edit2: On third thought what I got was probably not Tung oil at all lol...."
Bladesmith,3aqwrd,kingswee,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:47:32 2015 UTC,Surface treatments don't stabilize burl. Wood hardener is sometimes used but it is used while the wood is under a vacuum in order to increase its porosity.
Bladesmith,3arg1q,Sooooobored,3,Mon Jun 22 22:22:18 2015 UTC,"You can use it full strength if you are doing stainless or semi stainless, but I have cut the Ferric from Radio Shack at about 60/40 (40 water) doing simple carbon steel like 01 or 1095.

Bladesmith,3alkpt,TorchForge,2,Sun Jun 21 14:34:04 2015 UTC,"What are you tempering and what's your desired results? A shallow hardening steel is going to behave different than a deep hardening steel. Often I'll do my first temper at 20 degrees F lower than my final in order to get my desired conversion of alpha to beta martensite on something like W2 but on 1084 I'll do 2 or even 3 cycles at exactly the same temp, allowing for a complete cool down in between. Another thing to watch for on certain steels is temper embrittlement which can occur at too high a temp for a longer cycle. Look for Heat Treaters Guide Companion in the Google play store, it's free and has the properties and methods for a lot of different alloys just keep in mind that it's industry so they typically assume a larger mass than blades and you'll have to tweak the info a bit for your purposes but it's an invaluable starting point."
Bladesmith,3alkpt,zero_fiat,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:14:56 2015 UTC,"Okay, because im tired and have no clue what that means, i've got a clarifying question for you. Is more or less heat treats harder or softer?"
Bladesmith,3alkpt,zero_fiat,2,Sun Jun 21 19:48:58 2015 UTC,"More heat generally results in a softer steel, but every steel type varies. There are also temperature ranges that can cause embrittlement along certain grain boundaries of the steel, but it is difficult to approach these using anything except a torch/kiln/forge for simply carbon steels IIRC (Edit: Derp. /u/zero_flat already mentioned this).  Most steels have a temperature/hardness diagram available. They typically look something like this: https://pmpaspeakingofprecision.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/40-carbon-hardness-temper-temperature.jpg"
Bladesmith,3alkpt,TorchForge,2,Sun Jun 21 20:56:58 2015 UTC,"just keep in mind that a lot of those diagrams are ""industry"" diagrams and are based on 1"" cross sections, when you get to blade thicknesses things can and often do change quite a bit.. but I use them all the time as a reference when dealing with a new steel. Typically the only thing that needs to be changed is the times, but with some steels you've gotta change the starting temperature as well, as they're much too high or drastic for a 0.0625"" distal taper cross section with a 0.1875"" spine at the choil let alone a zero-point grind to the edge.  But when adjusting it is required it's often something where you drop the temperature but increase the over all duration.. Like I said before, heat treating is as much a science as it is a skill. :) When in doubt I start low and work my way up. -J"
Bladesmith,3alkpt,zero_fiat,2,Sun Jun 21 22:53:44 2015 UTC,"/u/TorchForge pretty much nailed it.. although, iirc, temper embrittlement can actually happen if it's held at an elevated temperature long enough (say 425F for 6 hours, depending on the steel, particularly when differential hardening). Bottom line is, what's the steel you're using, what's the maximum thickness of the piece, what's the achieved hardness from quenching, what kind of toughness are you looking for and what's your absolute lowest hardness you're willing to compromise? From there we can guesstimate time, temps and everything else. - heat treating is a science as much as it is a skill and unfortunately you can't always cut corners, especially not until you master the underlying principles involved. Another, and probably the most important question is, did you properly normalize your steel after working it? It doesn't matter if you're just doing stock removal, normalizing is all about resetting the internal structure of the steel, every action can affect it, and without it you're not going to get a workable base to begin your other heat treating procedures.. Sorry, I know it's a long winded answer but this is the part that imbues your knife shaped object with a soul and makes it an actual knife, there's no shortcuts worth taking.. :) I did a video on the very rudimentary basics of heat treating if you're interested: https://youtu.be/m-XBRxomvd4?list=PLQkr7gudKG-kF1FRVgkk4Tn67gbeeBWdM"

Bladesmith,3akh5i,bladedfrisbee,7,Sun Jun 21 02:12:21 2015 UTC,"My first knife was made from a circular saw blade. The steel actually IS good steel and it will harden to about Rc 60 - 63 using a torch and a bucket of motor oil AND it is cheap! I have made a lot of knives in the intervening 20+ years. Let me tell you a few things about circular saw blades. They are very hard to begin with so you have to drill it with carbide and cut it with a 4"" grinder. If you really want to anneal (soften it a point where you can work with it with normal tools) you will need a high temp oven and about 12 hours. The big bastard that you are looking at is probably way thick and will take a LOT of grinding which can not be done with a file unless it has been annealed. The saw blade that I bought cost me the princely sum of (I believe) $10. It was 24"" in diameter and was, therefore, much easier to work with.  So here is my advice: don't waste your time and energy with saw blades. This is the silly shit that has been promulgated by the likes of cowboy idiots and users of Goobers Goop and ""Leading Knifemakers"" magazines. Real knife steel is easier, cheaper, better and can be worked safely with common tool that are NOT 4"" grinders!. As was said before, talk to Aldo about a stick of 3/32"" 1085 or 1075.

Even if you want to do it roughly freehand, go over all the curves with the french curves so you have a crisp line to work to.  Balance...If you're making a full tang knife then drill out some larger holes(10mm+) between the pin holes. use an angle grinder to dish out the center. if you've got the right equipment, learn how to taper a tang.  if you make it a stick tang, the balance will more or less take care of itself 9 times out of 10"

Bladesmith,3al5gt,thesirenlady,2,Mon Jun 22 00:47:14 2015 UTC,"This strictly applies to forging. imagine you have a straight bar of steel, you start to hit one edge and the hammer blow spreads material out in all directions(or some, depending on the hammer) from the point of impact. so not only is the edge being pushed down and becoming thinner, its also becoming longer. meanwhile the other edge, the spine of the blade, is still the original length.  so the outside is longer and the inside is shorter, a curve, like a banana"
Bladesmith,3al5gt,obeythehypnotoad,3,Mon Jun 22 01:54:23 2015 UTC,"The important thing is the shape of the blade edge. Imagine keeping the same edge as that knife you linked without curving the spine down to the tip.   With longer knives the balance tends to be forward of the handle. You can't make a 12"" blade and have it balance right where the handle meets the blade. But here are some tricks:   Distal taper on the blade. The forward 1/3 of the blade can taper without much harm (the ""business"" part of a chef knife is rearward).  Use stabilized wood for the handle. Volume for volume stabilized wood is heavier.  Don't worry about it. Most of the time you're using chef knifes for ""low cut"" work where the tip rests on the cutting board."

But the other wheels are going to have to be offset from the frame a considerable amount for them to align centers.  wait, where is the polished piece of steel going? You just want to use it as a solid post for the belt to run over?  Its not really like a platen. a platen provides a backing for the belt, it is not neutrally a running surface. Curving around a steel post is going to cause a lot of friction, build a lot of heat, take a lot of power(more than 1hp), and isnt actually going to provide a very nice grinding action."

Bladesmith,3ahdwd,nicodiumus,3,Sat Jun 20 04:58:37 2015 UTC,It's important you keep it cool when grinding post ht. A thin edge like you need on these knives can get hot very fast.
Bladesmith,3ahdwd,RDalman,2,Sat Jun 20 07:21:50 2015 UTC,"This. Definitely this.  One of the keys is to use only fresh, sharp belts. Once the abrasive on a belt has glazed, it's not cutting effectively which causes two problems. First is extra friction since the the edges of the abrasive are rounded off and not cutting effectively. Second is that because the abrasive isn't cutting effectively, the chips that it's generating aren't cleanly and quickly removed from the workpiece. The removed chips do a lot of carrying heat away from the cut surface. Machinists will know what I mean here.  Liquid cooling is the best way to keep things cool. Ideally you want either the belt or stone spinning in a water bath (this is a PITA to set up, can degrade belt backers and glue joints, and is a MESS), or to have a mist of coolant spraying on the belt as you grind. This is a little more tenable, and still kind of messy, but does the RightThing(tm). Also, the gentleman cited below recommends the Tormec wet sharpening system. Not cheap, but not insanely priced either if you're hunting for that extra 1% of performance.  I heard a lecture by a German metallurgist named Roman Landes a number of years ago who specializes in really fine edges. He was able to instrument the very edge of a blade with EXTREMELY sensitive temperature sensing equipment to run some tests. They found that a blade moving over a dry stone actually created ridiculous heat on a microscopic scale at the interface of the steel and the abrasive. I think it was something like 2500C (note, this is on such a small scale that you'd never feel it). With wet grinding, this was significantly reduced and resulted in less overheating of the very fine edge of a blade created by very high grit honing. Again, we're talking about the micron scale here, but it's a neat piece or research to back up the claim that wet grinding is best."
Bladesmith,3ahdwd,rdeker,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:07:56 2015 UTC,Would you suggest using some liquid soap and water combination to run over it while grinding? Something similar to what is used with tile cutting? I can make that if it would help during the machine finishing process.
Bladesmith,3ahdwd,RDalman,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:29:36 2015 UTC,"Yes anything as long as you keep it below tempering temperature. Reducing belt speed can also help, but the finer grits can be difficult. Not all belts can handle wet grinding also so look into that. I go to 120 grit on belt and then hand finish."

If you use the rasp only for hot work, it also doesn't matter that you ruin its hardness.  Something else to try is hot wire brushing.  One of those butcher's block brushes with the flat bristles will do an incredible amount of smoothing to red/orange-hot steel."
Bladesmith,3ado1d,tossik,4,Fri Jun 19 07:13:51 2015 UTC,"Nice but be careful with grinding aggressively.  A blade of any significant length (3"" or longer) will certainly flex as you thin it without any support behind the blade.  Flex on unhardened steel usually means you end up with a slight bend which translates into uneven grinds when using a jig.  Great basic design and would be good to rough bevels in before doing a final hand grind to perfect things."

Bladesmith,3ado1d,thesirenlady,2,Fri Jun 19 11:03:17 2015 UTC,"buy aluminium angle. buy door hinge. screw together.  most knife handles never exceed 5 inches in length, so you know how long to make it.  most knife handles never exceed 2 inches in width, so you know what size angle you need.  though as i say most times when a jig like this comes up, its not the best way to do it."
Bladesmith,3ado1d,thesirenlady,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:25:51 2015 UTC,What's the best jig?
Bladesmith,3ado1d,allsortsofmeow,4,Fri Jun 19 12:48:47 2015 UTC,"A square block of wood and a rest that changes angles is superior in many ways to the reverse.  Firstly a variable angle rest is much more versatile. I use mine to set the 7 degree angle for folding knife lockfaces, beveling dovetails for bolsters, angling the front of blocks for correct handle orientation etc. Very easy to reset to square when you need that too.  secondly your jig block is simple and cheap. a dressed 2x4 is square enough for most peoples purposes. the blank can be securely held to the block with 2 small screws or nails. You can lay the block onto a flat surface, put the knife onto the block and let it sit naturally against the same flat surface as the block. this will give you total repeatability on both sides and also if you should need to put the blade back onto the block.  The block will also limit the size of the rest you need to be able to accomplish any grind. Notice how long the typical rest used with the other type of jig is. Because the blank is only supported directly under the handle, the length of the rest must extend so many inches out each side to accommodate the blade length. The rest seen on the last shot will only allow you to grind 4 or 5 inch blade at most.  Alternatively with a plain block, the entire length of the blank is supported in every aspect. You can have a block thats 15 inches long and the rest still only needs to be 2 inches. with the angling jig you also either need to apply downward force onto the clamping block itself or support the blade with your fingers to prevent the belt from dragging the tip down and tipping the jig. No physical contact means you dont have to worry about heat build up, just grind it till its done."

Bladesmith,3acw3s,Fargraven,2,Fri Jun 19 02:12:26 2015 UTC,"The tempering process converts any unstable martensite (formed by quenching steel at its critical temperature) into ferrite, and any unstable carbides into stable carbides (cementite). This reduces hardness but gains toughness, essentially.  Assuming that your quench went well, you will need to determine what temperature is necessary to achieve the hardness/toughness ratio you desire.   Each steel type tempers to different points of hardness at different temperatures. For example, a quenched bar of 1095 tempered at 490 degrees F will achieve 61 RC whereas a quenched bar of 1040 tempered at 490 degrees F will achieve 49 RC. However, at this temperature, the oxide color should remain consistent based on the type of steel you are using.  If you have enough experience, you could accurately judge hardness due to the color of the tempered oxides. Or, if you want to do a soft-back draw with a torch instead of using a toaster oven, you will need to rely on colors exclusively. There is a nice chart available here:  http://www.anvilfire.com/article.php?bodyName=/FAQs/temper_colors_hardness.htm  If you do go the route of using a toaster oven, PREHEAT THE THING FIRST. Toasters don't heat evenly and in order to do their initial warmup will blast heat inside. This can result in an over-tempered blade from the get-go.  Additionally, austenite retained from the quenching process (which is unstable at room temperature and contributes to catastrophic failures in blades if subjected to shock forces) can be converted into martensite via cryogenic quenching prior to the tempering process to make an even stronger blade. This is typically only applicable to eutectoid and hyper-eutectoid steels, however (carbon contents at ~0.8% carbon and upwards). But hey, I've probably go on long enough.  That being said, AKAIK there are no professional metallurgists on this sub (myself included). Therefore, I would take anything posted here as it relates to the chemical and metallurgical properties of steel with a grain of salt (or a grain of austenite, if that's your thing)."
Bladesmith,3acw3s,TorchForge,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:22:19 2015 UTC,"You should temper to a temperature, not a color.  verify the temperature of your oven and you cant go wrong."
Bladesmith,3acw3s,thesirenlady,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:30:25 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. Unfortunately I don't have a heat treating oven. I've used a kitchen oven, but it can be innacurate and inconvenient. Will a toaster oven work? I believe most go to around 400-450 Fahrenheit."
Bladesmith,3acw3s,thesirenlady,3,Fri Jun 19 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"95% of knifemakers use a toaster oven. Like I said, just verify the temperatures until you're satisfied and just trust in them.  I have a regular old oven thermometer as well as a thermocouple with digital display so i can read it from the other side of the shop."

Bladesmith,3ac3hv,Anjeer,3,Thu Jun 18 22:03:15 2015 UTC,"Etsy is a shit hole.  Let me explain. Searching 'letter opener' brings up 1600 results. Many of those are hokey antiques, blanks, or poorly engraved china trinkets. You want to put yourself in the middle of that?  The only use you'd get out of your page would be via directly linking others to your storefront. in which case, why have it in the first place?  If Etsy gave a single fuck they'd more carefully curate their users to actually achieve what they set out to do.   Buy and sell handmade or vintage items, art and supplies on Etsy, the world's most vibrant handmade marketplace   even the actual handmade stuff on etsy is real bottom rung stuff"
Bladesmith,3ac3hv,thesirenlady,5,Thu Jun 18 22:35:40 2015 UTC,"I used to be able to find interesting and well made stuff on Etsy, it really made me sad when they opened it up to allow ""manufactured"" stuff. now I can't find a damn thing without running into 5 million mislabled pieces of crap from a factory in a 3rd world country...

Bladesmith,3a6zv3,boxingnun,2,Wed Jun 17 20:19:01 2015 UTC,One of the most common weapons among pirates!  Good job!  Did you turn the rosewood or carve it?  I have been getting into tomahawk making and was wondering how you do your handles.
Bladesmith,3a6zv3,boxingnun,2,Thu Jun 18 13:42:27 2015 UTC,"This one is carved in a tear drop cross section like a normal tomahawk handle would be, although now that I look at it in pictures I didn't quite get the proportions correct on this one. I have another that I did for it that was too small. I did this because I didn't want to ship it out with just a normal hickory handle on it, the customer already has a box of those, I thought I'd give him something a little more special for this piece.  Essentially, I just cut the corners off the block lengthwise on the bandsaw and did the rest on the 2x72 belt grinder and made one hell of a mess doing it!"
Bladesmith,3a6zv3,boxingnun,2,Thu Jun 18 13:45:44 2015 UTC,"Lol! I hear that!  I will have to dig it up if you're interested, but I know of a business that will turn handles out of exotic hardwoods and are willing to do custom work.  Turned some white oak handles for me that turned out great!"

Bladesmith,3a6wem,Crecy333,3,Thu Jun 18 14:33:20 2015 UTC,"As a craftsman, I can appreciate that on many levels. However, I've learned that even selling imperfect pieces can be worthwhile (with the understanding of their value), as it can fund the study needed to make greater projects.   I'm a bit of a collector of strange knives, with a specific interest in dirks. I commissioned a dirk once from a learning smith who had only made small knives for utility. With the funding and the motivation of a commission, he made a wonderful dirk that has lasted with some hard use for almost three years now, showing no sign of damage.  Would you consider taking a commission for purpose of furthering your experience?"
Bladesmith,3a6wem,Crecy333,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:48:01 2015 UTC,I would certainly consider doing commission work! You're well aware that I am still learning the tricks of the trade though right?

I'll look at the knife and say ""This was made when was still starting out. This was before he made his masterpiece. The beginning of something glorious.""  And, if you don't get famous, then I look at that knife and think ""I got a great knife from that one guy.""  Win-win for me. I'll PM you later tonight after I get off work, and throw some ideas at you."

Bladesmith,3a6wem,BrokenCrw,6,Wed Jun 17 21:39:51 2015 UTC,"That is completely wrong... Hardenabilty is a function of alloy content, almost completely carbon content. (5 percent of rebar is unhardened. Unless you specifically bought stock 60, its just a scrap melt of steels. The simple fact of the matter is if you want to really bring up your knife making to a higher level, you simply have to use known steel.  Yes, scrap steel can be good practice and fun and all, but the soul of a knife is its heat treat. And you cant get a really excellent heat treat on mystery steel."

Black ironwood, or leadwood, I think is the one that is more common in that area, but 'ironwood' without a modifier in the woodworking industry and in knifemaking usually refers to desert ironwood. The term gets thrown around a ton for any dense, hard wood really. Desert ironwood is very well known in knifemaking circles just because it is ridiculously dense and hard, even though other woods can also work great for handles."

There were a few different kinds that I got to see - the black ones were longer like 4""  and slightly thinner maybe like 5/8"" diameter,  and just beveled on the ends like that one.  the one in the picture does look a bit longer than any I've seen though.    You have the shiny chrome one right? They are much stronger than the black ones and yeah perfectly round like ball-end, and then the stone ones were the strongest but the smallest.  I know Ive got one around, I'll dig it out for yas"

Bladesmith,39ycc4,mere_iguana,7,Tue Jun 16 05:37:02 2015 UTC,Go for it. The only way I know of getting an accurate read on steel is to have a lab test it. But I would just make something out of it and see.

Take a picture if necessary, then check on google images for how various grades of steel spark and compare.  Also, in the future, gather up some small scrap pieces of various grades of steel and keep them marked. That way you can do a direct comparison on your grinder."

Bladesmith,39yycl,Fargraven,3,Mon Jun 15 22:43:37 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, decarb is more a matter of time at temp, so if you just let the steel cook off at heat you're going to have more decarb; normal forging doesn't ever allow it to get more than a few thou deep.  What I'd be more concerned with regarding working things white-hot is grain growth, which can get pretty gnarly if you lose track of your heats and let something soak too hot for too long.  It is worth remembering that cameras don't always show the color of hot steel terribly well, so some things that look white hot on film may be more in the yellow heat zone, and I've seen some times where the steel looks far darker than it probably is as well."
Bladesmith,39yycl,taksihat,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:47:00 2015 UTC,"Ah so it's more of maintaining it at the temperature rather than just reaching the temperature. That makes sense. Thanks.   Yeah I'm also practicing normalizing the steel in between forging and quenching, to shorten any elongated grain.   That's true, any picture I've taken of hot metal has always come out looking really inaccurate."
Bladesmith,39yycl,rdeker,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:56:00 2015 UTC,"Remember also that when you normalize that you're bringing the carbon back into solution so it can diffuse and even out again.  That said, the recipe for decarb is time + temp + oxygen, so good atmospheric control can reduce the tendency to decarb. Also, as has been said, it's usually not more than a few thou deep, so your finish grinding SHOULD get rid of the decarb layer. If you have a knife that seems to hold an edge better after several sharpenings, you didn't get through the decarb. ;)"
Bladesmith,39yycl,nomerkiah,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:04:29 2015 UTC,"Ah that's right, the grinding. That makes perfect sense, thanks."
Bladesmith,39yycl,nomerkiah,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:24:57 2015 UTC,"It depends on the type of steel you have. Swords are normally made of a very simple carbon steel like 1075 or 5160. Decarb means you lower the carbon content. One thing you don't want is low carbon content at the edges and a core that is hard which means an edge that doesn't retain its sharpness and a core that would snap upon impact. If you go white-hot you risk of destroying a thin blade. If you put too much heat or too much stress in the steel, I believe you should anneal your blade to redistribute the carbon evenly and reduce the grain size for a successful heat treatment afterwards. This is only true for simple steel like O1 and other high carbon steel"

Bladesmith,39v0fh,eabigyear,3,Mon Jun 15 04:05:17 2015 UTC,"The last two pics are the best shots I could get with my camera. I don't know if it has a good grain, or if I should have tempered longer.  I heated to non-magnetic, quenched in peanut oil, and then tempered at 460F for an hour, per the instructions on the package the steel came in.  What am I doing wrong?  What did I do right?  I'm really interested in improving my HT."
Bladesmith,39v0fh,JinglesTheMighty,2,Mon Jun 15 00:53:18 2015 UTC,"The grain looks pretty big. You shouldn't be able to see sand like structures in the metal, it should be uniform grey. This image shows the difference between large and small grain.   Did you normalize the steel before quench and heat treat? Bring it up to critical temperature, exactly as you would if you were quenching it, then let it cool in air. That reduces the grain size considerably.  Whenever the steel is glowing, the grains are growing. The hotter the it is, the faster it grows."
Bladesmith,39v0fh,JinglesTheMighty,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:49:25 2015 UTC,"So, does that mean it didn't quench fast enough? Or did I keep it too hot too long before the quench?"
Bladesmith,39v0fh,cyberdark10,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:01:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, so take what I say with a grain (heh, get it?) of salt.   The grain structure of the metal grows when the metal is hot. How hot, I don't know, there is a formula for steels, but that is WAY above my level of understanding.  You can draw parallels of grain size to the number of strands of wire in a cable. To make the cable flexible, there are many smaller strands that are twisted together. When there are many strands, the cable is more flexible. If you look at this photo, the cable on the left would be more flexible that the cable on the right, because rather than the metal shearing, it slides. While this isn't exactly the same for grain size, the analogy works.   As for reducing grain size, this is achieved primarily by going through a process called normalization. This video, despite its age, goes over the process fairly well. TL;DW, normalizing is bringing the steel up to non-magnetic temperature and then allowing it to slowly cool down in air. The slower you cool the steel, the softer and more malleable it gets, which is what happens when you anneal. Doing this multiple times will bring down the grain size and make the metal more uniform in structure, which increases strength."
Bladesmith,39v0fh,thesirenlady,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:16:11 2015 UTC,"Get a bucket and some sand instead, cools it much more slowly and prevents oxidation.   Also, while it isn't a formula or anything I generally use this as a heat treat guide. If it's too high above the conversion point to austenite, then the grains will increase in size. The longer you leave it there, the larger the grains."
Bladesmith,39v0fh,cyberdark10,6,Mon Jun 15 02:47:27 2015 UTC,"Sand is not really ideal for that application. vermiculite is what you want to use. and it has nothing to do with oxidation. at that point, all the oxidation you're gonna get has happened inside the forge"

Bladesmith,39v0fh,thesirenlady,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:05:27 2015 UTC,"No, I mean that after bringing it to critical temperature more scale will form outside of the forge, by putting it it it sand you can prevent that, so it doesn't make much sense why ""nothing to do with oxidation."""
Bladesmith,39v0fh,JinglesTheMighty,3,Mon Jun 15 13:28:58 2015 UTC,"The reaction that forms the oxides is happening inside the forge.  The moment you pull it out of the forge, the temperature starts dropping, below the temperature at which scale forms. the damage is done, your scale is formed. and its not going to be stopped by a bunch of particles in a bucket"
Bladesmith,39v0fh,largos,3,Mon Jun 15 13:41:47 2015 UTC,"I know you can use ash or something similar to anneal the blade, is that what you are talking about? That will do a better job of it, but considering time constraints, open air is probably most peoples best bet."
Bladesmith,39v0fh,JinglesTheMighty,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:00:07 2015 UTC,"If you use sand, make sure it is not cold/damp! I've hardened O1 steel trying to normalize/anneal with sand.

Bladesmith,39v0fh,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:36:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks!!!  So, confession, I had previously heated it up to reddish hot, and then quenched.  However, I forgot to check for non-magnetic, so I re-quenched.  I'm guessing that's what caused the large grain?  In any case, I'll play around with normalizing it, and try a re-quench, temper, destroy cycle again.  I don't have a setup that will let me forge weld the broken piece back into the work piece, so might as well destroy it some more!!"

Bladesmith,39v0fh,rdeker,2,Mon Jun 15 03:00:28 2015 UTC,Can you give an honest review of your forge? I've been researching building my first and trying to decide on which material. Bricks seem to be the most dependable.

I haven't run it with propane yet, just mapp.  The bricks are cheap, and easy to carve up! But that means easy to crack if you over tighten the sides. It was a FANTASTIC way to get started and wet my feet.  However, I'm sourcing a brake drum, some 2"" steel (non-galvanized), and a hvac fan that I can use as a blower because the little forge can't heat up 1/2"" square stock in a reasonable amount of time. I think I spent 5-6 min heating the material and couldn't get it much into the orange, much less yellow/white. Bang, bang, bang, reheat. ಠ_ಠ"

And even though grinders/buffers are real simple pieces of tech,  theres not many who would equate buying anything from Harbor freight as a buy and invest type situation.

Bladesmith,39iefc,TorchForge,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:38:22 2015 UTC,Careful with buffing wheels when you are buffing out a knife. I don't even use them because I've heard so many horror stories of people getting impaled by their blades after the buffer snags the blade and throws it back. I became dead convinced to not use a buffing wheel after I heard about another making getting impaled in the nutsack by one of his knives.
Bladesmith,39iefc,fluffy-d-wolf,2,Fri Jun 12 02:58:11 2015 UTC,"TorchForge speaks the truth. I've been injured many times and in one instance nearly killed by a buffing wheel.  Although a necessary piece of equipment in many regards in the shop, they are by far the most dangerous tool in any metal shop.   If you do not have a good deal of experience with them, do not attempt to buff blades, they will maim/kill you.  That being said, there is no reason not to get one and practice on less dangerous objects until you are confident with the machine. The real trick to a buffer is do not let the surface of the wheel come into contact with an edge or point unless it is oriented with the direction of travel of the wheel.  As for scratches on the blade, they are all removable. If you are still seeing scratches, you haven't sanded enough.  The best way I find of doing this is to sand in one direction with, say for example, 120gr, then sand perpendicular to your previous direction with 200gr, change directions again and sand with 300gr, then again with 400.  Each time you change directions you will be able to clearly see the scratches from the previous grit, keep sanding with each grit until the scratches from the previous grit are gone."
Bladesmith,39iefc,fluffy-d-wolf,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:48:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks! I never thought to do it this way, very interesting method.   I have an engineering internship right now, and my parents put me to work when I'm home, so the wheels may have to wait. Never thought they would need that much practice."
Bladesmith,39iefc,thesirenlady,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:41:23 2015 UTC,"You're welcome.   Even with a lot of practice, the buffer deserves a lot of respect. When I'm about to buff a piece I stand in front of the buffer and think about whether or not I have the necessary focus at that moment to do it, if not, I don't even turn it on. I put down my piece and come back when I'm in the right frame of mind."
Bladesmith,39iefc,TorchForge,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:59:48 2015 UTC,"I may have to get one and put in on an adjustable speed grinder, as that may or may not help the process and increase the safety. Maybe buy some armor and a nutshell maybe too. (the armor is mostly sarcasm)."

You can get blanks like that, although you may have some trouble. Or are you asking how much work it would be to make such blade blanks without power tools?   To make one blank like that out of such thin AEB-L would depend on the size of the blade, but I'm assuming at that thickness you're probably making kitchen knives. With a hacksaw and a filing jig, I'd say a few hours per blade blank, then you'd have to carefully sand to about 200-320 grit so you don't get too much decarb during the HT.   If you've already go the blade blanks, I can't imagine you would even need to do work on them."

Bladesmith,398w69,f1zzz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:33:57 2015 UTC,"I second both of those guys. Though I haven't made any knives from scratch yet, I understand the process intimately. One thing I've noticed, OP, is that there are a plethora of videos out there with people who don't completely understand the process. They have an idea, but they miss (usually) some point of the heat treat process. Make sure you are getting your advice from a well respected person in the community (like WS and AG), and not Joe Schmo who only kinda listened."
Bladesmith,398w69,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,2,Wed Jun 10 13:50:28 2015 UTC,"I second Walter Sorrels.  He has a YouTube channel with lots of good videos about knife making.  There's also this build along I did:  http://poorfolkbows.com/knife.htm  It's hard to tell just from looking at a knife whether it's good quality or mall ninja crap.  One way to tell, though, is by being able to identify the maker.  If it's somebody you can google and read up on, then that's better than ""made in china."""
Bladesmith,398w69,poorfolkbows,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:24:14 2015 UTC,"A lot of it depends on the materials and the design, and then how the materials are used. Just look up knife on wikipedia for a simple primer on the parts of a knife. A lot of the mall ninja stuff has cheap steel, no real tang, and not necessarily even a heat treat, and a design that isn't about function but rather about selling to angsty teenagers. A real blade needs at least carbon or a solid stainless steel that is heat treated, a design that is made to cut one way or another, and something that isn't just spiky and black and ninja shaped. If you want to make something, look up the names that /u/iolithblue said, but if you want design, lurk on /r/knifeclub for a bit."

Bladesmith,398dyr,jayfeather314,4,Wed Jun 10 00:14:10 2015 UTC,As long as it isn't going to be used it should be straight forward. Since it is metal though I would advise sanding the blade so the paint can stick to something. You may also look at a primer that can work on metal. Don't rush the paint job either. It will look better if you do multiple thin coats instead of just one heavy one. Hope this helps
Bladesmith,398dyr,Ipaintshit,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:05:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you! You mentioned sanding the blade. Would you recommend sandpaper that is rough, fine, or somewhere in the middle?"
Bladesmith,398dyr,King_Fisho,3,Wed Jun 10 02:11:40 2015 UTC,"Car painter here. Definitely sand it down first. I would go 320 grit before primer, few coats of that, then 400 grit for sanding down the primer. /u/Ipaintshit clearly knows how to paint shit, so yeah few thin coats of paint to get a deeper color."

So I should sand with 320 grit, then apply a few thin coats, then sand again with 400?  Also, forgive my unfamiliarity with painting, but do I need a primer in addition to the spraypaint, or is there already primer in most spray paints?"
Bladesmith,398dyr,Ipaintshit,2,Wed Jun 10 16:54:58 2015 UTC,"correct. That would give you the BEST result. I'm not saying other ways wouldn't work, but I would think that will work the most.

Bladesmith,398dyr,autowikibot,2,Wed Jun 10 02:30:11 2015 UTC,"The best aerosol spray-on solution will be with duracoat (https://www.lauerweaponry.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=category.display&category_ID=1065) it can be applied to bare metal without a primer.  The absolute best option would be to use cerakote, but that's a bit more involved.  Don't use electrical tape at all. I've tried it to mask off parts and the residue is too much to deal with. It didn't make much of a clean line when I tried either but that may have been my inexperience.  Painters tape works best - specifically Frog Tape.  When spraying, follow the directions carefully. The most important part is keeping the workpiece clean and easy to hold while spraying. I'd recommend suspending it from some string, so you can evenly coat every side without needing to flip it over or move it to put it somewhere while it dries."

They aren't designed for removing metal though, more for polishing up the blade to give a satin finish. If anything they just blend your grind lines together.

For the last part, I took 220 grit sandpaper to it and only sanded along the length of the blade to get a consistent brushed-looking finish.  For the wood, I did most of the shaping with a 100 grit belt sander. The finishing was done by hand with strips of 220 and then 400 grit sandpaper.

If you want to avoid any sort of seam in a narrow tang blade, you will have to use a different method of construction commonly referred to as ""hidden tang"". One common method involves drilling a hole into a block of wood and then burning the blade tang into the hole.   Alternatively, you could use a type of epoxy like loctite 330 which cures to a transparent color."

Bladesmith,38z7wn,WingedDefeat,3,Mon Jun 8 10:16:25 2015 UTC,Used it in aviation quite a bit for various things. Commonly used on steel flight control cables for cleaning them and protection after inspections. Cleans well and leaves just enough on to tack up and protect. It comes out sorta foamy and after a few minutes it typically gets tacky/sticky. I used it for motorcycle chains at home for years because free. Worked better than anything else I have tried from various dealers

Though, this isn't a substitute for proper knife care and there are other methods of rust prevention that work better."

Bladesmith,38tlv5,Razorick,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:19:23 2015 UTC,Blueing would be okay for a work knife but for anything in the kitchen a natural patina would be my  choice.
Bladesmith,38tlv5,thezep,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:27:28 2015 UTC,That's a good thought.  I have some knives that are strictly for work.
Bladesmith,38tlv5,Razorick,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:24:29 2015 UTC,Will a knife still rust through a patina or do they prevent that?
Bladesmith,38tlv5,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,2,Mon Jun 8 13:46:55 2015 UTC,It will make it more rust resistant but it will still rust if you leave water or food on it.  Patina is basically just like a controlled rusting.
Bladesmith,38tlv5,thezep,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:18:46 2015 UTC,"I did it on a camp knife I made, it looks good, but you can still smell the Selenium on it even after a few washes. Probably not food safe."

Bladesmith,38tlv5,Razorick,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"No.  A mirror polish just reduces the surface area of the blade exposed to air, slowing the oxidation process (rust).  Even so-called stainless steels will eventually rust given the right conditions.  Our shop uses an acid-dip to create a patina on the blade and then we coat the blade in oil.  Regular maintenance and cleaning are the only ways to keep your blade from rusting.  Though, certainly, stainless steels are much more forgiving in this respect."
Bladesmith,38tlv5,hit_bot,2,Sat Jun 6 18:52:58 2015 UTC,"Lol, silly bot creator. You're supposed to use your alt account. Have any pics of your patinas?"

Bladesmith,38tlv5,hit_bot,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"A mirror polish will help but only marginally. Keep it clean and dry after use and it will not rust, no matter what. Oiling is also an extra measure. I keep a forced patina on my high carbon blades as well which helps too. A lot of newer high carbon knifes and tools will come powder coated as well, which provides a similar role to the patina."
Bladesmith,38tlv5,StandForMe,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:10:35 2015 UTC,Alright. will a patina/powder coating stop rust?
Bladesmith,38tlv5,StandForMe,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:25:32 2015 UTC,"Yes. They can both come off, though a patina is easier to put on. Still keep them dry and clean, though you dont hardly have to worry about it like you would otherwise. A powder coating is especially effective."
Bladesmith,38tlv5,StandForMe,2,Sat Jun 6 19:28:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, alright then. Powder coating looks SUPER awesome, how likely is it to come off? and if i powder coat 01/w2, and the only exposed stuff is the actual edge, which would be a good polish, how likely would it be to rust, assuming it isnt left in 100% humidity and abused?"
Bladesmith,38tlv5,StandForMe,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:32:26 2015 UTC,"Contact points in a polymer sheath are usually where it would come off over time. You really shouldnt need a powder coating on O1, since it isnt as suseptable to rust as say 1095 or 5160, steels in which where ive seen the coatings. O1 still needs regular maintenance, but dont let it sit for ages and it should be perfectly fine."

Bladesmith,38r8xa,DrSloan,3,Sat Jun 6 03:19:05 2015 UTC,"Yes. why not?   Should the knives be heat treated separately because of their different profiles?   Define seperately. each in their own packet, yes.  Stand them up inside the oven.  The plates are mostly about keeping the steel flat. use em if you got em.  Same goes for cryo, if you already have it there its easy enough to just stick em in. you'll get a little extra hardness and wear resistance."

Bladesmith,38o186,yangxiaodong,4,Fri Jun 5 13:34:46 2015 UTC,All stainless steels essentially require a kiln to heat-treat them.  If you want a really good all-round stainless my choice would be CPM154. Send it to Paul Bos or Peter's Heat Treat and you should be good to go!
Bladesmith,38o186,aarongough,3,Fri Jun 5 15:26:48 2015 UTC,Forging stainless is difficult and AFAIK doesn't benefit the grain structure of the steel at all. A lot of stain-resistant and stain-less steels are just as hard to move under the hammer hot as they are cold. It's pretty much a stock-removal material in that regard and you'll need some sort of programmable heat treat kiln/oven.
Bladesmith,38o186,TorchForge,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:01:53 2015 UTC,"They can be difficult in the sense that they have to be treated at a certain temperature (i.e. 1476*f) unlike carbon blades that can any where between 1400 to 1550.  Also those aren't exactly correct temperatures, just examples."

Bladesmith,38bjc5,codecowboy,5,Wed Jun 3 03:44:28 2015 UTC,"I started out with a soup can forge. I then progressed to a brake drum forge. I wanted something that would burn clean, come up to heat quickly, and make less of a mess. So I did some reading online and tackled building a propane forge.    My knife making has suffered for the last year.  I'm working out of my house in a residential neighborhood.  The coal forge requires  setup time in the driveway and makes a colossal mess.  Since I'm working in the drive way I need a pretty day and several hours to work.  There has not been many of those over the past year.  I've either been too busy or the weather has been bad.  With this forge I can work out of the garage any night of the week.  http://imgur.com/a/YylQc"
Bladesmith,38bjc5,UncleJehmimah,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:44:40 2015 UTC,"That's a nice build. I've got a venturi burner sitting around that I plan to one day use for this. What kind of pressure do you need to run this on to maintain constant heat? My main concern would be gas consumption, as the forge we have at work is really quite the guzzler and isn't too much larger than this (three venturi burners in ring, spiraling down the barrel.) Then again, the space to heat is much larger so the returns per burner are lower."
Bladesmith,38bjc5,cadika_orade,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:31:10 2015 UTC,I don't have a gauge on it to get a reading.  From what I read there is a sweet spot between 10 and 20 psi.  Sounds about right based on how much I turn the knob on this 0-30 psi regulator.
Bladesmith,38bjc5,cadika_orade,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:54:45 2015 UTC,I'm looking to start metalworking after I move out of my apartment. I'll almost definitely be moving to a suburb.  How is the noise when you're hammering? Does it bother the neighbors?
Bladesmith,38bjc5,xkcd_transcriber,2,Wed Jun 3 16:55:28 2015 UTC,It's noisy and it carries.  My neighbors can definitely hear it.  But I've lived there for 12 years and I've made it a point to be very respectful.  I've been blacksmithing two years now.  I make sure I'm done making noise in the garage no later than 8:30pm at night.  On Saturdays I don't start till after 9am-10am.  So far there have been no complaints.  I also have no Home Owners Association so there really isn't much that anybody could do about it.  I just try and be a nice guy.
Bladesmith,38bjc5,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:34:27 2015 UTC,That's good to hear. Hopefully wherever I move I'll have decent neighbors who don't mind too much.  I saw someplace else today that wrapping the anvil in chains and magnets will quiet it down. Do you know of anything else I can do to reduce the noise? Maybe I could get a silent hammer.

Bladesmith,38bjc5,madeulook1,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:34:05 2015 UTC,Yeah.  Should update the album with the new welds.  I built this over time as a progression to show all my mistakes and lessons learned.  Using a proper welder made a big difference.  Also not monkeying with the power of the welder so badly.  Honestly I just finished this build and have not done any serious work with it yet.   The hot spot is directly under the fire.  So middle of the forge but on the left side due to the angle of entry.
Bladesmith,389kw2,BLKavarice,7,Tue Jun 2 19:57:59 2015 UTC,"I'd say that it's mostly okay, but even the ""good"" grain size that is shown is way too big.  This is a far better representation of what you should be going for."
Bladesmith,389kw2,taksihat,2,Tue Jun 2 20:21:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, the grain size in my album photograph is still on the large size. I didn't have any snapped knife stock that showed proper heat treatment so I just made do with what I had on hand. The photo you posted is a much better representation.   Originally, I had written that guide up in a series of notes to myself during the course of my studies. I've since read JD Verhoeven's ""Steel Metallurgy for the Non-metallurgist"" and found it to be immensely helpful in understanding the nature of steel. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in chemistry, industry, or knife making. The more I work with steel, the more I realize I know essentially nothing about its true nature. It's a sobering material in that regard.   A copy of Verhoeven's work is available online in PDF form here:  http://www.sabladesmith.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/J._D._Verhoeven_Steel_Metallurgy_for_the_Non-Metalurgist.pdf  Currently, I've been focusing on techniques and chemicals used for etching my knives and I've been enjoying it thoroughly.

Bladesmith,389kw2,TorchForge,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:00:32 2015 UTC,That's very nice and simple. How do I actually test that though? I'm not sure how to cut the metal to get such a nice cross section. With a hot cut? I'd imagine an angle grinder would just make it look like cut steel.
Bladesmith,389kw2,Fargraven,2,Tue Jun 2 23:14:25 2015 UTC,Snap it.
Bladesmith,389kw2,zoidbergmerc,2,Tue Jun 2 23:21:51 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I didn't even think of that, heh. Thanks."
Bladesmith,389kw2,Fargraven,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:29:26 2015 UTC,"You can cut it, polish it up to 400 grit and etch too."
Bladesmith,389kw2,zoidbergmerc,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:30:57 2015 UTC,"Yup, I'll usually snap a blade every now and then after HT to check the grain"
Bladesmith,389kw2,FJ1906,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:08:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Especially any time you're trying a new steel, it's good to make a few sacrificial blades to confirm you're doing HT right.  Since I only HT by eye, I also make sure to do a couple if I'm moving my forge around, since the lighting changes.  Being lazy, I don't even always grind the blades I do this to.  Forge them nice and thin, HT and snap in the hardy hole on the anvil."

Bladesmith,389kw2,TorchForge,2,Tue Jun 2 21:34:31 2015 UTC,"With regards to the HT and tempering, how much would it differ for a hammer? I'm currently about halfway through my second hammer, and I'm having issues with my first being a bit too soft (first is a clipping/rounding hammer, second is going to be a driving hammer)  Awesome guide, by the way! Definitely saved for once I have some free time and spare steel"
Bladesmith,389kw2,IOwnTwoDogs,2,Wed Jun 3 04:02:51 2015 UTC,"What type of steel are you using for the head of your hammer? Usually, good hammers are made from alloy steel with a medium carbon content. Steel which contains nickel and/or manganese and/or molybdenum is ""tougher"" than 10xx series steel (simple carbon steel).  Something like 4140 - 4150 or 8640 - 8650 would make a killer hammer, but 4140 would probably be the easiest to obtain."
Bladesmith,389kw2,TorchForge,2,Wed Jun 3 15:43:52 2015 UTC,"These two are mostly prototypes, both have been reforged from your basic Sears Special I had laying around in the basement. The big one is a 2lb no-name ball peen that I turned into a square-face cross-peen, the smaller one I'm currently working on (I think it's better quality) used to be a Grey (brand) tinsmithing hammer.   I'm currently building myself a couple drifts/punches from a bar of H13 (not sure what that translates into, but it makes for decent cutting tools) - once I have those done I'm going to get started on making a hammer head from scratch!"
Bladesmith,389kw2,IOwnTwoDogs,2,Wed Jun 3 16:37:26 2015 UTC,"If you want to get something like a hammer hard, you'll have to keep in mind that it's a larger piece of steel than something like a knife and it will take longer to quench as such. You might try an agitated brine quench tempered back at 350 degrees F if you want something really hard, but if the carbon content is too high it could explode in the quench or fracture during use. It's tough to say unless you know the composition of the steel exactly.  Here is good info and a HT schedule for H13: http://www.speedymetals.com/information/Material19.html"
Bladesmith,389kw2,TorchForge,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:53:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll do a bit more reading and maybe see if I can't track down some of the local tool builders, I'm not sure I'd really enjoy it if my hammer exploded on me.   May I ask what your stance on motor oil quenches is? I'm about to do a change on my truck, and was thinking 6 quarts of used oil might be easier than tracking down some restaurant oil, since it'll already be here. I've forged out a couple old rasp knives that I'd like to put a decent edge on."
Bladesmith,389kw2,IOwnTwoDogs,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:12:54 2015 UTC,"Motor oil works fine. I don't use it due to negative health effects associated with volatile petroleum compounds, but if you just turn a fan on and don't inhale deeply you should be fine. 6 quarts isn't that much, so you won't be able to quench large blades and the quenchant will heat up fast."
Bladesmith,38bcro,yangxiaodong,3,Wed Jun 3 02:55:25 2015 UTC,"You can break it and check the grain structure, but I'm going to assume you're looking for a non-destructive way of checking. ;)  In that case, did you clean off the knife before temper? What color did it reach?"
Bladesmith,38bcro,hammertongs,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:02:31 2015 UTC,"Haven't tempered yet, as I'm unclear if that will make re treating it harder."
Bladesmith,38bcro,hammertongs,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:25:51 2015 UTC,"I'm new to this, but I'd assume that if you needed to re-treat, you would anneal the blade, and then re-quench & temper. Whether or not it had been tempered wouldn't change that process.  I hope I am corrected if I'm wrong."
Bladesmith,38bcro,shrikezulu,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:34:07 2015 UTC,"You can skip the anneal.  Annealing would make it dead soft, but it would also grow the grain substantially.  As long as he didn't overheat the blade, it can be stuck back into the forge, heated just past critical and then quenched."
Bladesmith,38bcro,thesirenlady,2,Thu Jun 4 02:42:00 2015 UTC,"Immediately after quench, using a sharp file see if it cuts into the blade. it should skid off a hardened blade  post temper you can push the blade, perpendicular to the edge into a brass rod held in a vice. the edge should not take a permanent bend"
Bladesmith,38bcro,FJ1906,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:57:03 2015 UTC,"After quench I'll test with a file along the edge and spine and compare it to a piece not hardened. The time should skate right over it and not dig in, it will sound different too. Another thing I look for is the scale flaking right off the blade after quenching, might depend on what you use as a quench medium. After tempering I grind down to my desired edge thickness and put a quick edge on it and do the brass rod test. Hold the blade at a 45 and press down while bringing the edge across the brass rod. You should see the very edge flex and return, not stay deformed or chip out. If it stays deformed then the temper was too high. If it chips out, temper was too low. I highly recommend doing a break test every few knives just to check the grain."
Bladesmith,38bcro,FJ1906,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:46:33 2015 UTC,"okay then. Should i be pushing the file? because while pressing the file down a bit, it managed to round off a bit of the spine, but not much, and it sounded more ""hollow"" or tingy than the bar."
Bladesmith,38bcro,TorchForge,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:53:03 2015 UTC,"I don't lay right into it but I give a firm stroke, enough to tell if its filing or just scraping the blade. If you file on a corner it will shine it up but you shouldn't be able to take the corner down to a flat spot. Compare how it files to a piece of unhardened material. Also, what steel are you using and what was your heat treating procedure?"
Bladesmith,38bcro,hammertongs,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"01 steel im using the basic bubba procedure of heat until it's red, let it air cool, heat till its red again, toss it into the oil and stir it around."
Bladesmith,38bcro,TorchForge,-2,Thu Jun 4 01:06:54 2015 UTC,"Drop it on a block of concrete. It should neither shatter nor bend and will ideally put a good dent in the concrete. This is not a comprehensive test, but it's fast, simple, and effective."
Bladesmith,38bcro,hammertongs,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:03:56 2015 UTC,"I've been using O1, and was told that after quench, it's pretty delicate, and would shatter if dropped. That's not the case?"
Bladesmith,38bcro,TorchForge,2,Wed Jun 3 14:32:25 2015 UTC,"Usually, heat treating includes normalization, quenching, and tempering (at least for the home smith). Do not perform an aggressive drop test until the knife is completely tempered back or else it will break. Sorry for the misunderstanding."
Bladesmith,387kfb,Caesar100,3,Tue Jun 2 12:33:42 2015 UTC,"Very cool!  I actually made my first ""knife"" sometime before age 10.

Bladesmith,386j2s,perfunctificus,2,Tue Jun 2 05:11:29 2015 UTC,"I rigged up a little rest protruding from the front of the workbench, underneath my grinder platen.

Bladesmith,385ojk,TolaniO,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:42:09 2015 UTC,"No link, but here's what I did:   Obtain soft Insulating Firebrick rated for 2300+ C.  This was easy for me, as there's a firebrick manufacturer in my town. Ceramic supply stores should also carry them? Purchase Angle Iron for the frame. Tractor Supply to the rescue for this, as well as the tap for threading the holes and the nuts and bolts (1/4-20). Purchase Torch from Home Depot. This was the most expensive piece, by far, at about $64 (http://www.homedepot.com/p/Bernzomatic-BZ8250HTKC-Map-Pro-Hose-Torch-Kit-331665/203391035). Take 2 bricks and place them together. Measure and cut the angle iron with a hack saw so you have enough space to drill the holes without hitting the firebricks. They are so soft you can literally push your thumbnail into them. Drill and tap the holes for the bolts.  Drill one hole in each pair to 13/64"", and the other hole to 1/4"". Tap the 13/64"" hole for 1/4-20 threads.  A drill press really helps here. I tried to hold the pieces in a vice, and it was pretty difficult to get them straight.  Moved the rest of the pieces to a drill press and had it done in no time. Assemble the angle irons around the firebricks for test fitting. You should be able to fit them easily around the firebricks, clamping the bricks together. Put on mask.  You do not want to breathe the dust from cutting these firebricks. Drill the main chamber in the firebricks.  I removed the firebricks from the frame for this.  Using a doorknob holesaw like this: http://www.amazon.com/Door-Knobs-Hole-Diameter-Drilling/dp/B00BG9KMHK, I drilled out the center of the blocks. Drill to depth, remove the saw, pop out the brick pieces with a screwdriver, repeat until you have about 7-8"" of depth. Reassemble the bricks in the frame and secure. Drill hole for torch. I used a 1/2"" bit for this, and positioned it on the side wall near the front of the bricks, slightly angled towards the back of the chamber. Clean up dust. Remove mask. Set the forge assembly on a safe surface. I use 2 more firebricks. Test fire. Insert the torch into it's hole, and pull the trigger. Realize that you go thru MAPP gas pretty quickly, and maybe dropping down to propane will be more cost effective. That little bottle doesn't last long at all. Try to explain to your wife why the little forge isn't going to work in the longer term as you work out plans for a larger propane forge, or even a coal forge, or figure out if you just need to build a heat-treat oven with temp control."

Since finishing it I've seen that the teeth on the hacksaw blade are a slightly different colour to the body of the blade, so I am suspicious only the teeth are hardened, bit annoying. Also I'm rubbish at sharpening knives, so this one is as blunt as every other knife I own.  The knife is small owing to the size of the hacksaw blade. I made it as a practise really as I intend to make a bigger one out of a file.  I'd be interested to hear the easiest steps you think I could take to make an improvement on this.  Cheers.  EDIT: There are 5 images here but imgur didn't make an album like I was expecting, you have to click ""Next"" and ""Prev"" to get through them. Sorry!"
Bladesmith,37zcdz,Fargraven,1 point,Sun May 31 18:07:51 2015 UTC,"Looking good. What type of steel and wood did you use?  Sharpening can be very frustrating. I'm also pretty terrible at it. A hand sharpening kit might be a solid investment. I have one like this. I use a sharpening kit after I get a rough edge with a belt sander. Because at that point, it's easy to go over the apex of the blade and just mess it up, with something as aggressive as a belt sander."
Bladesmith,37zcdz,Fargraven,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:24:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, the steel is a hacksaw blade and the wood is some pieces of oak I had lying around.  I sharpened with a whetstone but I have trouble maintaining a consistent angle, especially where the blade curves."

Bladesmith,37wb3p,ben_chapleski,1 point,Sun May 31 02:28:39 2015 UTC,Thanks so much. I Think I'll use tru grit- do you know what hardness I want or if I need Any of the extra cost stuff like cryo?
Bladesmith,37wb3p,ben_chapleski,3,Sun May 31 03:14:51 2015 UTC,You probably want to shoot for 60RC.  A sub-zero or cryo treatment is a good idea for that steel.  It will help with the martensite transformation.

Bladesmith,37ocla,Mr_Hanowski,4,Fri May 29 03:02:54 2015 UTC,"I Wanted to challenge myself.  Built with only forging,  twisting,  and hot rasping.  Usually have a nice sander to create the bevels and smooth things out, and I wanted to see how a knife of mine would turn out only forged. I heat treated it in oil and it can shave hair. Also this is my first piece I tested my new stamp I made!"
Bladesmith,37ocla,t_F_,2,Fri May 29 03:06:07 2015 UTC,Did you/can I use a new file for this?
Bladesmith,37ocla,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,3,Fri May 29 04:38:03 2015 UTC,"What I've seen said in other places is that usually people prefer older files. I'm not sure if there is a magic date or anything, but newer files are supposedly used with worse steel. Maybe it's hardened steel welded on top of some softer steel (the name slips my mind) like 30x."
Bladesmith,37ocla,derekstandby,2,Fri May 29 14:26:25 2015 UTC,"Yes you can.  I herd that you should buy good,  more expensive filed for this though.  Apparently some of the new Chinese ones just have a high carbon coating or something like that.  I can't remember where I seen that,  but I honestly think if you want some just go to your local scrapyard. You'll find a variety of different shapes and sizes and these old ones will be good stuff! Plus,  they will be a fraction of the cost for a new one."
Bladesmith,37ocla,LML13,3,Fri May 29 18:14:12 2015 UTC,Very cool. I'd like to try that sometime. I just need to finish building my garage first.
Bladesmith,37ocla,IOwnTwoDogs,3,Fri May 29 03:28:24 2015 UTC,I've never heard of hot rasping before. Sounds neat. Are there any tricks to doing it or any good videos on the technique?
Bladesmith,37ocla,bbp84,1 point,Fri May 29 07:13:56 2015 UTC,"It's pretty well exactly what it sounds like - take an older rasp (I'm sure there are people other than us farriers that use rasps?) and use is on the steel when the steel is at a dull red or black heat. I use a floor vice when I'm hot rasping my shoes, but I'm sure if you did it often enough it'd be worth building a specialised jig to get the right bevel"
Bladesmith,37ocla,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,1 point,Fri May 29 16:18:21 2015 UTC,Basically just filing while hot.  You could probally find some good stuff on YouTube though.

Bladesmith,37pnkc,lt_sparky,2,Fri May 29 12:23:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't start with thicker than 3/32"" (~2.3mm). Especially considering how narrow carving knives are.   For kitchen knives, when in doubt go thinner."
Bladesmith,37pnkc,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Fri May 29 17:43:54 2015 UTC,"We use steel 1/8"" thick for kitchen knives, which comes out to 3.175mm.  This is slightly smaller than your 3.5mm, but I don't figure it's much of a difference.  You're probably fine using the 3.5mm."
Bladesmith,37pnkc,hit_bot,1 point,Fri May 29 16:57:50 2015 UTC,"ohhhhh, like a meat carving knife, not wood. cus im thinking 5mm would work for a wood carving knife."
Bladesmith,37m3aw,TorchForge,1 point,Thu May 28 16:53:01 2015 UTC,I like the look of the laminate. My only dislike is the lack of visible damascus on the blade. Maybe a thinner piece of 1095 would change that? Just personal preference.
Bladesmith,37m3aw,iamzombus,2,Thu May 28 17:29:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a thinner piece of core stock would accomplish that. Unfortunately, 1095 CrV is difficult to source and I've only found it in 0.25"" thickness. I could hammer it down as well prior to welding, but it's a lot of work to keep it all even.

It was a tricky thing to show a blacksmith technique without being to much technical but still accurate at the same time. As well with the outside shots, we both wanted to show time spending to make a blade and the weather they are facing in Aubrac during the winter. Your review will help us to make a better film next time !"
Bladesmith,37izb0,Fargraven,2,Wed May 27 23:47:11 2015 UTC,"Ideally, take it up to non-magnetic then put it gently in a bucket of light fluffy ash or something else soft and insulating and non-flammable.  That will slow the cooling and make it as soft as possible for cold work."
Bladesmith,37izb0,Verrence,1 point,Thu May 28 03:32:44 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks. Is normalizing necessary to do, after it was forged and before its heat treated? I'll do it, but out of curiosity, will my heat treatment be messed up if I don't normalize the steel beforehand?"
Bladesmith,37izb0,thesirenlady,7,Thu May 28 10:16:27 2015 UTC,"Previous post actually described annealing. normalizing is a process that reduces grain size. it is as simple as heating to critical and then cooling to black heat, cooling to just under non-magnetic and then cooling to black, heating to just under that and cooling to black. should take you 5-10 minutes.  its quick enough to do it after forging and before annealing, so you may as well. but on a forged blade its absolutely required before heat treatment, due to the high amount of heat and beating you've done to it the grain is very large. (pay attention forge vs. stock removal guys!) Stock removal makers do not need to normalize, because it still has the very fine grain size from when it was rolled at the factory."
Bladesmith,37izb0,thesirenlady,1 point,Thu May 28 12:53:33 2015 UTC,"Ah I should really read up on some metallurgy books and get these sorted out and understood. Does it have to be cooled in something like ash or vermiculite, or just air cooled? Also, should it cool to air temperature or just to black colored?  Thanks."
Bladesmith,37izb0,Verrence,2,Thu May 28 13:56:06 2015 UTC,"Just air cooling. you dont want it to be fast like a quench, or slow like an anneal."

Bladesmith,37gszc,Dracenduria,1 point,Wed May 27 16:11:34 2015 UTC,The one I use is a modded version of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHD10DjxM1g I use it to melt cans and I am working on a pair of tongs as soon as I get my anvil in. As far as heat tempering goes a toaster oven works well. A good book I have been reading is called $50 knife shop it goes in to great detail on knife making.
Bladesmith,37gszc,yangxiaodong,1 point,Wed May 27 17:28:46 2015 UTC,"where did you get a pail from? i've seen home depots pails, but im not sure if they do or dont have galvanization or some sort of toxic coating."
Bladesmith,37gszc,Dracenduria,1 point,Wed May 27 23:25:18 2015 UTC,"I got it from ACE hardware. you just need a steel pail. you want to use this in a open environment you have propane fumes, and metal fumes. any coating will burn off. the way i did it was i cut a hole about the size of the nozzle of the propane torch in the side, i leave the burner about 1-2 inches away from the bucket to avoid gas build up. works great for smelting, quicker than coal or charcoal. You should wear a mask, some good gloves and a good pair of boots. Just be careful, hot metal is unforgiving."

Bladesmith,37dnno,-magilla-,1 point,Wed May 27 00:18:03 2015 UTC,Think if I route the power thru a big rheostat I can get better temp control?
Bladesmith,37dnno,-magilla-,2,Wed May 27 00:52:56 2015 UTC,No. The problem is the accuracy of the probe. You will nees to adjust it up or down via the PID which controls the temp.
Bladesmith,37dnno,-magilla-,1 point,Wed May 27 01:16:20 2015 UTC,"Let me rephrase, can I completely cut out the need for PID if I use a rheostat. A 1500W rheostat is cheaper than a PID unit and-K type."
Bladesmith,37dnno,thesirenlady,1 point,Wed May 27 01:45:35 2015 UTC,Well you would still need something to tell you the temperature.  You can get the pid and thermostat on amazon for fairly cheap.
Bladesmith,37dnno,carbonnanotube,1 point,Wed May 27 01:51:51 2015 UTC,"But would I really? Gas and solid fuel forges don't have pyrometers, or do I because I gotta close the door to keep the heat?"
Bladesmith,37dnno,carbonnanotube,1 point,Wed May 27 02:03:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah you keep the door closed. You need even temperatures and want to know exactly what they are. A rheostat would just control how much current went to the coils, it could help maintain a temperature by reducing the heat, but it wouldn't be worth the trouble. Ovens just turn on and off to maintain the temperature."
Bladesmith,37dnno,-magilla-,1 point,Wed May 27 02:05:34 2015 UTC,"Gas and solid fuel forges don't have pyrometers   Ideally they do if you're using them for heat treating.  If you arent going to the trouble of adding a thermocouple and PID, dont bother building the kiln. You cant heat treat stainless without precise temperature controls. if you dont want precise control just build a forge."
Bladesmith,37dnno,carbonnanotube,1 point,Wed May 27 02:20:48 2015 UTC,I don't suggest that. Go with ON-OFF control through an SSR.   The refractory has enough thermal mass to keep things pretty consistent in there once you get to temperature.
Bladesmith,37dnno,-magilla-,1 point,Wed May 27 04:32:18 2015 UTC,Are you not using a Type K with a PID controller?
Bladesmith,37dnno,carbonnanotube,1 point,Wed May 27 03:52:11 2015 UTC,I am but it's off by a few degrees I think.
Bladesmith,37dnno,GrinderMonkey,1 point,Wed May 27 03:50:55 2015 UTC,"Type K at best is typically +/- 2-3C even with a full calibration, so a few degrees is fine.   For heat treatment as long as you are within 5C you will be fine.  Does your controller do cold junction compensation? That is a common cause for error in the very cheap controllers."

I haven't yet heat treated either of the plain carbon steels, so I can't give you a hardness or ease of sharpening comparison yet. As a side note, I think you meant O1 tool steel and not 01.

Best case scenario its 5160, an incredibly affordable steel. whole sword worth will cost you $36.  Is that really worth saving when you're putting in 10s of hours into it?"

Bladesmith,376tat,hoopladude,1 point,Mon May 25 14:51:39 2015 UTC,I've heard that 1050 is common in swords but I'm not sure why. It's a low carbon steel. Maybe for increased flexibility.
Bladesmith,376tat,Fargraven,3,Mon May 25 12:04:11 2015 UTC,Because you dont need it to be anywhere near as hard as a knife. so all the extra carbon isnt doing anything
Bladesmith,376tat,thesirenlady,1 point,Mon May 25 22:07:34 2015 UTC,"5160 steel is one of the most commonly used  You can also use anything between 1055 and 1075. Much lower and it is too soft, much higher it is too brittle."

Bladesmith,374spy,loganmn,2,Sun May 24 22:15:03 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people who start with just lurking on forums. bladeforums.com is a good forum, as is this one. You can buy some great books, but you will learn much more by just starting and making mistakes and trying.   I wish I had known just how easy it is. Gough Custom on youtube has some awesome introduction walkthrough videos. (He is also an awesome redditor, I don't remember his username.)  He literally covers all of the basics of stock removal knife making in just a few short videos.  You can start with just files, and do a ghetto heat treat at home or you can send it off to be professionally heat treated for under twenty bucks or so. If you have access to tools, it makes it faster, but not necessarily easier. Except a drill press is easier than drilling steel by hand. There are places that sell steel specifically for knifemakers. I recommend new jersey steel baron, just google it.  The right steels in good shapes, for good prices. Great service too. Wow I sound like a shill. (disclaimer: I am not affiliated with any of these people I am recommending. I make knives as a hobby by hand for myself. I don't share my knives or sell them except for with family, because I am embarrassed by them.) 1084 or o1 are good beginner steels if you want to heat treat yourself, and they make good blades with a professional heat treat."
Bladesmith,375ye5,_hopppy,3,Mon May 25 04:03:02 2015 UTC,"they were always there, under the mill scale. If you want to get rid of those you're gonna have to keep filing/sanding/grinding  Next time consider buying ground stock. I thought mill scale was bad enough even with a 2x72. dont know how anyone copes with hand tools."
Bladesmith,375ye5,thesirenlady,2,Mon May 25 04:31:07 2015 UTC,"If you're doing this by hand tools, get a single cut file and learn to love draw filing. It'll take care of these in short order.

Bladesmith,374pmg,beardedheathen,1 point,Sun May 24 21:21:29 2015 UTC,What are you calling a furnace? Melting metal for casting?  Not a lot of knifemakers have reason to do casting
Bladesmith,374pmg,thesirenlady,1 point,Sun May 24 22:29:58 2015 UTC,For heating steel for blacksmithing. Would that be a forge?
Bladesmith,374pmg,thesirenlady,1 point,Sun May 24 22:34:36 2015 UTC,yeah i mean technically that would make things immediately clear.  You would not be able to use this for a forge.
Bladesmith,374pmg,rdeker,1 point,Sun May 24 22:40:10 2015 UTC,"If you like your knives as puddles of molten steel, yes. :)  The only real way to use an electric setup for forging would be to use an induction heater, but they are VERY pricey."
Bladesmith,374pmg,rdeker,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:18:32 2015 UTC,Ok so you could do this then cast the knife...
Bladesmith,374pmg,Twizler73,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:21:12 2015 UTC,"Well...technically I suppose it's possbile, but casting steel is really nothing like casting aluminum/bronze/brass. The temps are MUCH higher, you have to deal with oxidation issues, and the chemistry of steel in a liquidous state is a different beast all together. You could melt steel into a little ingot, but you'd have to forge that out, so you need a forge anyways. :)  If you REALLY want to deal with liquid steel, you may as well smelt from iron ore and make your own. You'll still need to forge it when it's done, and it's a LOT of work, takes much bigger equipment than in this video, and will cost a lot in the end. I've done it, I hang out with guys a couple of times a year that do this, and it is BY FAR the most expensive steel I've ever seen.  That being said, I may try to build myself one of these micro-arc-furnace thingies and see if I could make little teensy Wootz pucks with it. Could be fun! (Note: I am a sick, sick, man to even consider this...)"
Bladesmith,374pmg,doublehelix1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:37:57 2015 UTC,For casting it would be perfect.
Bladesmith,374pmg,OddTheViking,1 point,Sun May 24 23:54:53 2015 UTC,large scale steel production casting is accomplished using arc furnaces and is back up with natural gas burners. But the heat from an arc is way too hot and covers too small an area.  You might be thinking of an induction heater.

Bladesmith,3708qb,vankelst,10,Sat May 23 17:33:03 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of steel you find laying around will be mild steel, which is unsuitable for knife blades. The only way to be absolutely sure what it is, is to send it off to a testing lab, and have them analyze the chemical composition and that is expensive. You can also cut a small piece off, and try heat treating it.  If it gets hard, then it you can possibly use it, but you will never know what it is.  I will always suggest just buying known steel.  It's not expensive."
Bladesmith,3708qb,shrikezulu,4,Sat May 23 17:42:46 2015 UTC,"Okay yea I'll probably do that, so the main requirement is to be able to harden it?"
Bladesmith,3708qb,shrikezulu,9,Sat May 23 17:45:04 2015 UTC,"By and large, yes.  Hardness is the requirement that we want out of steels for blades.  It allows the knife to have a fine edge, and to hold that edge for a long time. Cut a small piece off, heat it to 1500 degree F and then quench it in some canola oil.  Try using a file on it after the quench, and if the file skates across the steel without biting, you are in business."
Bladesmith,3708qb,673moto,1 point,Sat May 23 18:02:33 2015 UTC,"Just a thought...what if you were to weld the edge?  Ever hear of  ""hard face"" welding?"
Bladesmith,3708qb,shrikezulu,0,Sat May 23 20:31:16 2015 UTC,"Never heard of it, but looked it up.  Honestly, I don't know if that would be sufficient.  You would need to hardface a high carbon steel to the mild steel. I guess you could also case harden the steel, or forge weld on a high carbon edge... but I think all of this may beyond the OP."

Bladesmith,3708qb,Szervetlen,8,Sat May 23 21:37:09 2015 UTC,Just a thought - good steel doesn't absolutely have to be of a known grade in order to make descent (amateur) blades out of it.  Here's a good article that will help you find stuff in junkyards and estimate what its composition and usefulness to you is.  Its more blacksmith-oriented but useful nonetheless http://www.anvilfire.com/article.php?bodyName=/FAQs/junkyard_steel.htm
Bladesmith,3708qb,Szervetlen,4,Sat May 23 22:46:31 2015 UTC,"You need some european store and some european steel. The steel available is a little different, so you will have to google the names.  Here is a few places you could get some:   https://www.brisa.fi/ - kinda short on plain carbon steel atm http://www.knifebargains.co.uk/acatalog/01_Tool_Steel_Knife_Making_Blade_Blanks.html#a7595 - o1 http://www.nordisches-handwerk.de/shop/stahl_rohlinge_stahl_nicht_rostfrei,rid,30,produktliste.html https://www.dictum.com/en/materials/steel/steel ""swedish steel"" is 1075 british people buy o1 from cromwell, but they dont ship outside uk there are a few more german stores"
Bladesmith,3708qb,thezep,1 point,Sun May 24 03:42:04 2015 UTC,Thanks /u/Szervetlen! I'll try nordiches-handwerk probably. Is 20euros a fair cost for 25cm of O1?
Bladesmith,3708qb,Idreamofmotorcycles,1 point,Sun May 24 11:50:59 2015 UTC,"If it includes shipping it is not too bad, 20eur for 25cm is pretty expensive, But if it is 10 eur shipping then it is not too bad.   How are you gonna heat treat? If you are not gonna use an electric kiln, 75cr1(1075) or o2 would be a better choise. O1 should soak at the correct temperature for 10-30 min. You should do some research on heat treat.  Another tip, is that you should not make your blade too thick unless you have a nice grinder. Filing a knife from 4 or 5 mm stock would be hell! 3 mm is already hell if your knife is not small."
Bladesmith,3708qb,mercu7y,2,Sun May 24 13:26:07 2015 UTC,"I always used files for knifeblanks before so I heat treated them with a forge and canola oil. And yea tell me about it, my last knife started from a file with roughly 6mm thickness"

Bladesmith,3708qb,rdeker,1 point,Sat May 23 22:18:07 2015 UTC,"It's probably some generic type of industrial steel. Most mystery steel is not suitable for blades. You can do a spark test, but I find them to be very ambiguous."
Bladesmith,3708qb,yangxiaodong,1 point,Sat May 23 22:32:07 2015 UTC,"i guess the bottom line is, it's a guess at best. you'll never really know what it is and chances are good anyway that it won't be 'good' steel.   now, none of that means you can't use it to make a knife. just a change in expectation, use this as practice. you can get three good sized flat pieces out of that c-beam, it looks like the sides are narrower than the back piece. i'd cut a ~half inch slice off the end so you got three pieces for testing your heat treat. my personal plan of attack -- of the three flat pieces, the larger back plate would utilize as much of the piece of steel as possible, a chunky cleaver style short chopper. one of the other pieces would be ripped down the middle to make two narrower knives. the last piece, i would rip about 3/4 inch or so strip off before cutting the remainder across the middle. so i'd have one large rectangle, two long narrow rectangles, one very narrow long rectangle and two small rectangles. i'd choose blade shapes that were different from each other to practice different bevels as well as a range of overall sizes from beefy to dainty - think to thin. and then after i was done and heat treated, i'd put them all through destruction tests. i wouldn't learn anything about the quality of the steel but i could test for general things like weaknesses in the design, how thin is too thin for a bevel before it'll chip out, how thin can i make a point before it can't hold on, as well as just general experience of making the knives to completion.   scrap may not be trusted but it can still serve a purpose."
Bladesmith,3708qb,944tim,1 point,Sun May 24 00:05:20 2015 UTC,I'll probably try making something out of it. Just for practicing. Your last sentence is spot on.
Bladesmith,370rc8,Torxnl,4,Sat May 23 20:06:18 2015 UTC,"Compare the composition. Many european steel mills make the same stuff american ones do they just call it something different. Might ask around on the british knife making forums, they know what's what."
Bladesmith,370rc8,thezep,1 point,Sat May 23 23:05:00 2015 UTC,"I just learned the difference is that s235 steel is only 0.23% carbon at most and 1084 a maximum of 0.84%. I just read that for knife making you need about 0.5-1.2% carbon, is that right?"
Bladesmith,370rc8,thezep,1 point,Sun May 24 17:40:08 2015 UTC,"That sounds correct but there are also several other components that can go into it that will affect how you heat treat it, how well it forges and grinds, ect. I'm by no means an expert I just know that you can get very good steel in europe they just have different names for stuff. For example bohler k110 is D2. Www.bucorp.com"

Bladesmith,370ngr,Pmjnx,1 point,Sat May 23 19:34:55 2015 UTC,"As long as you use a good glue there shouldn't be a problem with durability. As for aesthetics, I don't see how it would affect anything assuming you're still going to shape the handle and sand it down. Sounds interesting though, I'd try setting them so the bits are diagonal to the knife instead of perpendicular or parralel."
Bladesmith,36zlrh,scatking69,13,Sat May 23 14:02:46 2015 UTC,Use files. Your neighbours may complain about your breathlessness and sounds of frustration though.
Bladesmith,36zlrh,squilliam132457,6,Sat May 23 14:22:13 2015 UTC,"This is the best answer here.  Using the right kind of files and using the right technique can remove steel very quickly.  You also learn very quickly how steel works by hand, and this is a skill that is important. I have a 2x72, a bench grinder, an angle grinder, and a Dremel, and I still use files for certain tasks when making a knife."
Bladesmith,36zlrh,shrikezulu,3,Sat May 23 17:47:07 2015 UTC,I have a nicholson bastard file.  what others would be required if I were to shape the blade with files exclusively?
Bladesmith,36zlrh,shrikezulu,2,Sat May 23 18:33:45 2015 UTC,"Nicholson's are ok.  The ones from the big box stores are what I use, and while not the best files in the world, they get the job done.    I use single cut bastard files. 12"", 10"" and 8"" and 6"" are good.  The smaller the file, the smaller the gap in the teeth, and finer the surface will be.  The larger files are great for hogging off steel, and the smaller are great for smoothing it out a little. Build yourself a file jig; the one that everyone around here uses so your cuts are consistent.  Buy a small brass brush and clean the teeth our every few strokes.  Sometimes a carbide will get stuck in the teeth and it will gall the shit out of the steel.  You will know the sound.  It leaves a nice deep gouge and makes me want to murder someone. Half rounds are good for doing curves while profiling.  Get different sizes.  Also get some rounds and rat tails.  They will come in useful."
Bladesmith,36zlrh,free_will_is_arson,2,Sat May 23 18:47:55 2015 UTC,"yesyes, murder indeed. when i was working on one of my first knives, working on the bevel and close to finishing when i started seeing the dreaded gouges. WTF. keep going and i notice that the scratches keep changing, almost with every pass. WTF. smooth it out nice, do a final pass, more scratches. WTF. finally get the bright idea to look at the file, the grooves are just filled with flecks of metal. oooohh, right."
Bladesmith,36zlrh,shrikezulu,1 point,Sat May 23 23:30:55 2015 UTC,My story is remarkable similar.  I filed that knife so thin that it became a kitchen knife.  I wish I were joking.
Bladesmith,36zlrh,allsortsofmeow,2,Sun May 24 05:25:30 2015 UTC,"You also want a half round. I've done mine with a double cut half round and a double cut nicholson bastard file. Make sure you lay down plastic sheeting where you work, there will be a LOT of steel dust. Piles of it. It ruins carpets.  I then draw file with a single cut file, as /u/Shrikezulu said it leaves a smoother finish, which means less effort sanding later."
Bladesmith,36zlrh,superdork93,3,Sat May 23 23:27:28 2015 UTC,"A bunch of cities have places you can go that provide access to tools like grinders and sanders that you can utilize for your craft. They often have classes where you can learn more about your trade/hobby. The one near me is called Hackerspace Co-op in Austin, but you can probably find something similar near you.  If that's not something you are interested in, i would stick with metal files and sharpening stones. Living in an apartment, noise is not the only concern. If a wild spark from your grinder fell in the wrong spot, you could start a fire, and I am sure your neighbors would not be too keen on the noise."

Bladesmith,36zp40,Dangerzone979,8,Sat May 23 14:36:11 2015 UTC,I would really caution against using this sword for anything.  Stainless makes a terrible sword.  It's brittle and will break.
Bladesmith,36zp40,shrikezulu,-3,Sat May 23 17:51:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can be sure of that without knowing something about how that particular bit of steel was heat treated.  From what I've gathered, 440 can't get as hard as, say, O1 or 52100, but that doesn't mean they can't all be left in either a brittle or pliable state."
Bladesmith,36zp40,largos,9,Sat May 23 18:02:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can be sure of that without knowing something about how that particular bit of steel was heat treated.   I think you can as regardless of how its heat treated 440 has massive carbides, its just not tough enough to use in really long blades that you use to hit stuff with. Swing it about and you're likely to get hurt."
Bladesmith,36zp40,wkirbys,8,Sat May 23 19:30:09 2015 UTC,"440 will make a good knife, but not a good sword.  Stainless steel is brittle because of the amount chromium it has.  The chromium carbides slide into the grain boundaries of the steel, and makes it brittle. This creates weakness in the steel, and when it breaks, it will break along the grain boundary.  At best you will have a broken sword, and at worst, you will injure yourself or someone else. It has nothing to do with hardness.  The same hardness that you have in a knife would be horrible in a sword.  Swords need to flex"
Bladesmith,36zp40,shrikezulu,2,Sat May 23 18:08:43 2015 UTC,"Hardness isn't the only factor. As /u/wkirbys and /u/shrikezulu have pointed out, toughness is an important component. This is why largely 52100 is a much better sword material than, say, 1095/01.   Unfortunately not capable of being as hard =/= tougher/more pliable."
Bladesmith,36zp40,allsortsofmeow,2,Sat May 23 23:31:58 2015 UTC,"Cheapest way would be progressively finer grit sandpaper laid on something very flat and hard.  You can find YouTube videos on the sharpening process.  Don't ever use it though, especially if you get it sharp, the quality of the sword is likely so low that it will break if it's used or even if it's just swung around vigorously, sending sharp bits of metal flying in random directions."

Bladesmith,36zp40,shrikezulu,0,Sun May 24 14:03:10 2015 UTC,"To that I would say:  Why does it need to be sharp?  It bothers you that it's not a ""real"" sword?  It was intended to be dull because it is meant to hang on a wall.  If sharp is what you are looking for, I would encourage you to purchase a sword meant to cut.  They can be expensive, depending on what you get of course. Or, even better, you can use this as an excuse to learn to bladesmith and possibly make your own a few years down the road.  Not an easy journey, but a rewarding one."
Bladesmith,36zp40,bigcliffcole,2,Sun May 24 17:12:27 2015 UTC,Any flat smooth rock will work though. I mean people used them for centuries to sharpen their pointy things.

Bladesmith,36y68y,Turtletree,5,Sat May 23 02:39:48 2015 UTC,"The 1084 from NJ Steel Baron will make a great knife and is easy to work with. A great beginner steel. Also, it is probably the easiest steel to heat treat if you were going to do the heat treat yourself. http://newjerseysteelbaron.com/shop/1084hc/"
Bladesmith,36y68y,martin-riggs,1 point,Sat May 23 02:52:06 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks so much! Why 1084 as opposed to 1095?
Bladesmith,36y68y,pl213,6,Sat May 23 04:24:15 2015 UTC,"Carbon content. There are three classes of steels divided by carbon content, hypoeutectoid, eutectoid, and hypereutectoid. More here. The bottom line is that because a eutectoid steel forms a single phase of steel at a specific temperature, its heat treatment is greatly simplified. Hypo- and hypereutectoid steels both can form different phases of steel with different critical points, and so heat treatment for these steels is more complicated.  It happens that a eutectoid alloy of steel is 0.8% carbon. If you're unfamiliar with steel designations, the last two digits in 10xx series steels represent hundredths of percent of carbon in the alloy, so 1084 has 0.84% carbon, basically a eutectoid alloy. Because of this, it is very easy to heat treat even under the rather crude temperature control that a knifemaker without a heat treat oven will have. 1095 will certainly harden without good control, but you won't be getting everything you can out of the steel, and getting consistent heat treats is more difficult."
Bladesmith,36y68y,BLKavarice,1 point,Sat May 23 07:55:06 2015 UTC,"From what I understand 1095 is for stock removal knives since it already has a high carbon content.  Edited.  I don't fully understand all the nuances yet, but that was the gist of what my teacher told me when I asked the same question."
Bladesmith,36y68y,shrikezulu,9,Sat May 23 07:15:58 2015 UTC,"No, this is not at all true.  The steel does not become harder from forging.  The opposite is actually true.  Steel actually loses carbon as you heat and cool it.  It will escape into the atmosphere of your forge and it will also be lost when scale forms on the surface of the steel.  This is called decarburization.  This is the primary reason why you do not grind your knife edge too thin before you heat treat.  Decarb can remove just enough carbon from the edge steel to prevent it from getting fully hard.  I have had it happen.  Steel gets harder from quenching when above the Curie point (and a little from work hardening while cold).  1084 is a good beginning steel because you can heat treat it easily and it is forgiving.  There are issues with 1095 because it is a hypereutectoid steel, so special considerations need to be taken when heat treating.  It's not really a beginner's steel.  (Nor is O1 for that matter, but everyone around here is in love with it).  /u/martin-riggs is suggesting a good beginners steel.  Also, 1095 is perfectly good for forging.  Lots of bladesmiths use it.  I use W1, which is almost identical to 1095, except W1 has a few alloying elements in it, while 1095 is just a plain high carbon steel.  Steel chemistry is insane.  The carbon content of the steel can change how you heat treat a knife.  If you want to read more about it, go here. That will get you started, if you are really interested in this stuff(I am because I believe being educated about what I am working can only make me better).  Go here for a discussion that is much much more in depth."
Bladesmith,36y68y,allsortsofmeow,3,Sat May 23 08:02:26 2015 UTC,"Excellent advice. I started a knife with 1095 for my very first, and the blade was 5cm at the widest point.  I spent hours and hours filing. When I swapped to a AEB-L paring knife for a break, as well as a piece of W2, I was in disbelief at how easy they were to work. I now have 3 bars of steel (01, 1095 and 52100) sitting there in a ""when I get a 2x48/2x72 grinder"" pile.   I wish I had just bought 3 lengths of varyingly thick 1084/440C"
Bladesmith,36y68y,shrikezulu,2,Sat May 23 09:40:53 2015 UTC,"That's the unfortunate thing about steel.  People suggest steels without really knowing why they are good and what they are best for.  When I started bladesmithing, I spent hours every night reading everything I could.  I finally settled on using 5160(since it was easy to get for me) and 1080/1084.  That was years ago.  Just in the past 6 months or so have I started working with W1 and 1070.  I wanted to make damn sure that I had the right knowledge and skills before trying steels that may be more complicated."
Bladesmith,36y68y,allsortsofmeow,1 point,Sat May 23 17:38:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I think the only reason 01 is so readily suggested is the relative easy to get a usable result with poor heat treating. Personally I am yet to heat treat anything myself. I am much more comfortable paying someone else to do it professionally and guarantee that I get the absolute most performance out of my end product.   For anyone outsourcing heat treat as a beginner, they really need to be pointed towards some of the more easily worked steels that can be ground thinner before heat treat. I've got my first paring knife at .4mm thick at the edge and it came back perfect, the 1095 I'm too scared to take thinner than 1mm. Which means an ass load of filing on something stupid hard."
Bladesmith,36y68y,shrikezulu,2,Sat May 23 23:41:22 2015 UTC,"I do all of my own heat treating in my propane forge. I use a baffle to keep it from being exposed to direct flame, and a thermocouple to get my temps as exacting as I can. I will be building a heat treating oven here soon so I can do more advanced heat treats, and to make sure my temps are as good as they can get.  Outsourcing heat treat is a good idea, minus the filing part on hard steel.  You have my sympathies, that is for sure.  Character building though ;)"

Bladesmith,36y477,yangxiaodong,3,Sat May 23 02:18:25 2015 UTC,"I had the same question recently and did some research. What I found was that MAP/PRO gas (the substitute for the old MAPP gas which is not produced anymore) has 10% greater BTU output than propane. So long story short, MAP/PRO is a little bit better but probably not worth 3x cost but that's up to you."
Bladesmith,36y477,martin-riggs,2,Sat May 23 02:56:45 2015 UTC,"Btu?  Also, thanks.  So propane won't have issues getting up to a point where it can melt aluminum or temper 01 steel if I'm using a good torch head, right?"
Bladesmith,36y477,martin-riggs,2,Sat May 23 03:15:34 2015 UTC,BTU stands for British Thermal Units which is just a measure of the heat the torch gives off. You can definitely melt aluminum with propane. You could probably heat treat O1 with propane too but it is really difficult to heat treat with just a torch because it is hard to get an even heat throughout the entire blade.
Bladesmith,36y477,673moto,1 point,Sat May 23 03:53:22 2015 UTC,Mapp gas isn't the same as it used to be?  What? Why?
Bladesmith,36y477,martin-riggs,1 point,Sat May 23 04:33:13 2015 UTC,Nope. The only facility producing MAPP gas closed for some reason around 2008. Now everything you see is a MAPP substitute usually labeled MAP/PRO. MAP/PRO is mainly Propylene which burns hotter than propane but not as hot as the old MAPP.

Once the bevel is flat to the belt just apply more pressure to the top of the bevel to grind it higher, just make sure to keep the edge against the grinder or again you will fuck it up incredibly quickly. freehand saber grinds are pretty difficult compared to most things IMO."

Bladesmith,36u03p,hammertongs,4,Fri May 22 02:46:47 2015 UTC,"No, it's not an exercise in futility.  I do all of my plunges on my 2x72 and many many knife makers do.  I have never used a jig, and taught myself to do it freehand.  I am sure that it was harder to do it that way, but, in the end, I think it's better.  I am not dependant on a jig to get it right. My plunges are very clean, and very tight as well.  More than anything, just keep at it.  You are going to fail, and fail all of the time, and that is totally cool.  I still mess up from time to time on my bevels, and if I can't save it... it was a learning lesson then.  As for how to do it, you need to make sure the belt doesn't wander at all.  Make sure the tracking is good.  Start your plunge down the blade from where you want it to eventually end.  Get the plunge roughed out with a low grit belt, and then using higher grit belts, very carefully push it back to the place you want it to be.  Be very careful not to let the belt hop over the plunge onto the ricasso or it will round the plunge out, and make it muddy.  Since you are doing a slanted plunge, find something to prop the ass end of the tang on.  Trying to hold that exact angle is hard considering the grinder is exerting a continuous downward pull on the knife.  It's bound to slip.  Having a 2x72"" belt grinder is great; it makes things faster and can make you more efficient.  But it is not easier.  That speed and power come at the trade off of speeding up your mistakes.    edit - more words"

Bladesmith,36ro87,cubanesis,3,Thu May 21 16:11:29 2015 UTC,"You need to sand it to a rough grit. 60-100. Then degrease all surfaces properly with alcohol or acetone. Use better epoxy like araldite or g-flex maybe also. Mix it well, take your time.  And don't clamp too tight!"
Bladesmith,36ro87,RDalman,1 point,Thu May 21 17:43:13 2015 UTC,It's often suggested to get rough scratches out before heat treating to prevent stress risers from becoming an issue.  Would you recommend sanding the tang to a higher finish and then going back to 60-100 after heat treat?  Or are 60-100 grit scratches harmless enough to leave pre-heat treat?

Bladesmith,36ra07,cyberdark10,1 point,Thu May 21 17:10:59 2015 UTC,"Most likely, yes. So I'd reheat treat it afterwards. With axes you don't need to heat treat much, just about half of the blade, as that's the actual cutting edge and it's better for it to bend than snap."
Bladesmith,36ra07,cyberdark10,1 point,Thu May 21 17:23:15 2015 UTC,"Oh. thanks then, but i cant do that (heat treating is a bitch, and the only reason im trying to find an alternative is to avoid it)"
Bladesmith,36ra07,cyberdark10,2,Thu May 21 17:25:31 2015 UTC,"Ah. Well the thing is, if you can bring up the steel to a temperature where you can shape it, you can heat treat it in oil, water, or brine depending on the steel.   That being said, I can understand simply not being able to do something due to current situations, so if you can't do it, so be it."
Bladesmith,36ra07,cyberdark10,1 point,Thu May 21 17:35:11 2015 UTC,"Hrm, alright then. Because i've heard that its bad to heat treat by using something where you're moving it around a lot, and since i use a propane torch, there's a high chance of an uneven heat treat, at least by a small amount."
Bladesmith,36ra07,bhyndman,1 point,Thu May 21 19:17:29 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the size of the axe. If the actual edge is, say, longer than 4 inches, then no, don't do it, uneven heat treating can easily crack the steel due to it shrinking when quenched, the faster it quenches the more likely it'll crack. Brine quenches fastest followed by water."
Bladesmith,36ra07,Benman415,1 point,Thu May 21 19:40:32 2015 UTC,"oh, alright then.  and for things like 01, i want sorta an orangy tint, right?"
Bladesmith,36ra07,bhyndman,1 point,Thu May 21 21:01:24 2015 UTC,"Nah, nah, nah.   To heat treat it, blow torch the blade until it's glowing cherry red, then continue doing that for 5-10 minutes. This is called soak time, tool steels require this, but simpler steels don't. 1095, for instance, is a nice steel because it's dead easy to heat treat and use, but as a result you won't get quite as good of a blade.  After quencing in oil, what you'll do next is temper it. Tempering itself is easy, but to fully understand it you'll need to go all Bill Nye. Depending on the hardness you want, you'll heat it up to different colors then once it reaches that point you quench again.  What oil are you using, by the way?   Here's a more exact guide: http://www.threeplanes.net/toolsteel.html  If you temper the hardened blade until it's bright blue, then quench it, you'll get a rockwell hardness of ~58-60. The lower the tempering temperature, the harder it will be, the harder it is, the sharper it can be and it can hold an edge for longer, but it may snap in half above, say, 65 HRC. If you want I can give you an explanation of the phase diagram and go Bill Nye on you, but I doubt you'd want that, and if you did you could just read the link."
Bladesmith,36r4z0,yangxiaodong,1 point,Thu May 21 13:40:32 2015 UTC,"No. Vintage saw blades may be suitable, but many modern blades (especially cheap ones) use junk steel bodies and just weld on carbide teeth. Regardless, any mystery steel isn't going to give a great heat treat. You may be able to get away with it for a small knife,  would really be a detriment to something like an axe."
Bladesmith,36r4z0,kingswee,1 point,Thu May 21 13:44:04 2015 UTC,"Oh. Where should i go to look for vintage ones?  and i wasnt planning on heat treating, i'd heard they are pretty well hardened already."
Bladesmith,36r4z0,kingswee,1 point,Thu May 21 13:46:54 2015 UTC,"In all honesty it probably isn't worth the trouble. In order to work the metal easily you would need to anneal it (trying to work hardened carbon steal will eat up time, files, and grinders) which destroys the heat treatment anyway, so you would need to heat treat it again once you shape it.   In the end you will save yourself a lot of time, money, and frustration if you just buy new stock. You know what you're dealing with and exactly how to work it. It sure beats looking for a saw blade and testing it's properties to try to deduce the best way to heat treat it."
Bladesmith,36r4z0,kingswee,1 point,Thu May 21 15:02:31 2015 UTC,"Okay then, thanks. What would you recommend as a pre-hardened steel thing?"
Bladesmith,36r4z0,Benman415,1 point,Thu May 21 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"I don't quite understand what you mean. Could you be more specific? In case it helps I will just describe how hardening works.  You don't want to start with hardened steel because it will cause unneeded wear on your tools and will take a looooong time to shape and grind. Instead, you want steel that has been annealed and softened (most steel manufacturers will note if this processes has been done when you buy stock). The idea is to work it soft so it is easier and come as close to a finished blade as you can, then harden and temper it. Heating and quenching will make it very hard but too brittle, so afterword you let it sit in a warm oven for a while to back it off.   The exact times, temps, and hardness depends on the chemical composition of the steel and your method of heat treating will depend on your steel type. Typically 10XX (1095 and 1045 being common) and O1 tool steel are used by beginners, and both are widely available."

That is one hot forge, without a proper oxidizer metal oxides are very hard to ignite, and even with a proper oxidizer most home-made thermites are lit with magnesium or lithium.  Looking at the video in the description it seems he mixed iron oxides and aluminum oxides as he himself says, I doubt it was a Fe2O3, red rust, reaction, because the guy would've noticed the rust, so maybe it was an older type of steel that used magnesium. Alternatively, it could be that he accidentally added a certain type of aluminum alloy, as some contain amounts of magnesium. Though a much more likely explanation is that some steel had a Fe3O4 coating, black rust, which is hard to distinguish from tarnished aluminum.  Unrusted steel cannot react like that, so really black rust is the only thing I can think of if it was steel or iron."

Bladesmith,36ojlh,fergiz01,1 point,Fri May 22 02:36:26 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, steel's melting point is over twice that of aluminum's, so unless he made an almighty super forge, I don't think that's it."

Bladesmith,36oxwu,dudeman7557,3,Wed May 20 23:46:41 2015 UTC,"This is known as a recurve. In some respects it is easier with a file compared to a sander because the contact area of the tool is smaller. Those prone to doing recurve grinds will often use a 1"" belt or just the edge of a 2"" belt to achieve it"
Bladesmith,36oxwu,thesirenlady,2,Thu May 21 01:28:33 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks! - so I shouldn't have any problems or shouldn't do anything different from a ""normal"" style blade?"
Bladesmith,36oxwu,free_will_is_arson,3,Thu May 21 02:08:07 2015 UTC,"could be wrong, but i don't know if a gough jig would be able to do this. i don't have any experience using the gough jig for something like this but i think they are really only designed for an outside radius not an inside radius. let me know if you can though, this could open up a new world of design possibilities that i've considered but dismissed."
Bladesmith,36oxwu,allsortsofmeow,1 point,Thu May 21 02:17:34 2015 UTC,"My guess would be you'd file the two sections separately, then hand file to join the difference between the two. There's more than one way to skin a cat of course though."
Bladesmith,36oxwu,allsortsofmeow,1 point,Sat May 23 09:49:05 2015 UTC,"As a fellow beginner I'd recommend starting with something a bit simpler. More than likely you could pull off the recurve fantastically, and end up with a nice knife. In my experience so far however, starting tough leads to a less enjoyable experience and harder learned lessons.   Mistakes I fell into:  -Steel too thick, -Blades too wide (1.5"" sounds too small. It really isnt. don't do a 2"" blade like I did. oh god), -Designing weirdly curved fronts of blades, ,Weird curves in general.  All of this in mind however, I have a tidy knife coming along, and a simple paring to swap to when I get frustrated, and I've loved every second. It just depends on how attached you get to your projects and how much time you have.  Mistakes made early save mistakes later of course!"
Bladesmith,36j1p4,Jacoboverbay,11,Tue May 19 19:21:06 2015 UTC,"You could also make some sick crossbows with those springs. Leaf springs from small vehicles like snowmobiles make perfect crossbows, and that's a fun project."

Bladesmith,36j1p4,RufusSaltus,5,Tue May 19 22:42:13 2015 UTC,I'm seriously thinking of making a Ballista out of what I have here.
Bladesmith,36j1p4,IronAnvil,3,Tue May 19 23:08:37 2015 UTC,"Technically, a ballista operates based on the torsion from two twisted bundles of rope and not tension, as in a bow.  You could make one hell of a crossbow though."
Bladesmith,36j1p4,RufusSaltus,2,Wed May 20 01:40:05 2015 UTC,"Technically, the word ""ballista"" refers to many different devices.  We all know what he meant, so let's not be pedantic."
Bladesmith,36j1p4,IronAnvil,5,Wed May 20 03:21:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry, didn't mean to come across as pedantic; I just enjoy this topic and like sharing that interest.  Anyway, the torsion power is the defining feature a ballista, even if the other may mechanisms vary."
Bladesmith,36j1p4,UncleJehmimah,4,Wed May 20 03:42:11 2015 UTC,"Uh, no, that trigger mechanism is exactly what you want."

Bladesmith,36j1p4,UncleJehmimah,1 point,Wed May 20 03:31:01 2015 UTC,It'll be okay in wood if he chooses the right wood.  Elm would be totally fine.  Hickory or Ash would have no issues.  Maple or White Oak would probably be okay.  Red Oak?  Yellow Pine?  Not so much.
Bladesmith,36j1p4,RufusSaltus,1 point,Wed May 20 04:40:57 2015 UTC,"Any tight grain hard wood would do. Of course, you don't want to go too far. Years ago I tried using purple heart for high stress applications similar to this. Woods that hard have no elasticity, so they don't bend and form under force. That's a problem for a crossbow. You have to find something with the right balance of tight grain and elasticity. You also have to keep in mind which way the grain is pointing. It needs to be sort of tangent to the force, otherwise you're going to get the string simply pulling the wood apart along its grain."
Bladesmith,36j1p4,RufusSaltus,1 point,Wed May 20 05:23:25 2015 UTC,"Understandable, the scans are pretty low quality."
Bladesmith,36j1p4,frozenwalkway,2,Wed May 20 03:35:03 2015 UTC,That appears to be the standard style of crossbow trigger I've seen and Medieval crossbows could have draw weights of 400lbs.  You would need to find a place to machine the nut though. Here's another set of plans: http://users.utu.fi/sjsepp/paja/example_crossbow_1/example_crossbow_1_printable.png    (I take no responsibility for any injuries this might result in.)
Bladesmith,36j1p4,doublesecretprobatio,8,Wed May 20 01:47:38 2015 UTC,I spent sixty dollars on some scrap springs. I'll be honest I should a just bought 60 dollars of new steel from aldo

Bladesmith,36j1p4,runboyrun14,4,Wed May 20 03:41:29 2015 UTC,This is the truth.  I still have a pile of 5160 leaf spring steel from my first purchase over two years ago.  Just not worth the time to mess with it when there are far better and quicker options.
Bladesmith,36j1p4,IronAnvil,2,Tue May 19 22:37:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this has been said, but I would like to point out with the quantity of leaf springs you have there, there are bound to a large amount with micro cracks. My teacher (Nick Rossi) and I have talked about the best material to make knives from on a low budget, and leaf springs came up, he said something like ""Four of every five will be fine, but the fifth will have a micro crack, and you can't fix microcracks, not worth it in my opinion."" I think you should just buy steel, because it's just as cheap as a leaf spring. If you live in new england there is this guy called the ""New Jersey Steel Baron"" who only sells steel to knife makers. Sorry for the long post."
Bladesmith,36j1p4,aarongough,2,Wed May 20 13:18:35 2015 UTC,Is this a good metal to work with? Or is it that you don't care and just want the practice?

Bladesmith,36l2ok,fergiz01,2,Wed May 20 13:43:02 2015 UTC,every now and then. Because of the type of knives I make I invariably have to do some shopping with Alpha knife supply and USAknifemaker so gameco is mostly a backup for the basics. i use their abrasives though
Bladesmith,36l2ok,thesirenlady,1 point,Wed May 20 22:15:35 2015 UTC,"How do you find the price difference?   I've probably sunk about $300 into steel from Gameco now, and it's always a bit of a compromise on the bar stock size."

Bladesmith,36l2ok,weps_grd_pandemonium,1 point,Wed May 20 04:58:15 2015 UTC,Alright. How much longer should it take after its hardened to 58-60 rockwell?
Bladesmith,36l2ok,weps_grd_pandemonium,1 point,Thu May 21 03:35:28 2015 UTC,Longer? To reach your finished edge? Depends on how thin you want to grind your edge. Not long with fresh sharp belts.
Bladesmith,36jgi5,CyberKipper,3,Tue May 19 20:56:48 2015 UTC,It's definitely suitable and there is not much else on offer in the UK without spending considerably more money.
Bladesmith,36jgi5,wkirbys,2,Tue May 19 23:30:02 2015 UTC,Ok for small knives. You can get good variety of belts now.   For big knives it's going to be very disappointing IMHO.

Or reversed on the middle finger with index resting outside. Also feels great in a point-grip style hold. Made using the stock removal method with and angle grinder and 2x72. Ring started as a 1/2"" drilled hole, hand filed with a round bastard file, then when large enough finished it off with a Dremel and 120 grit sanding drum. Scotchbrite (400-600grit) finish, then acid stonewashed. The spine is all satin to make a twotone look.  Unfortunately I will no longer be able to take custom orders for Karambit and other ringed style knives for at the most 6 months.

Bladesmith,36fvee,Nordstar,4,Tue May 19 01:46:25 2015 UTC,"It depends on the discoloration.  As a general principle, yes the heat treat is ruined in that area.  More specifically, it really depends on how hot it got. Yes, you can grind that portion away and the rest will be fine.  As long as you don't overheat the other areas, you should be fine. As far as Nicholson's being 1095... maybe.  More than likely, it is a proprietary steel alloy that is close to 1095 or W1.    If you are planning to reheat treat the file knife, then you don't have to worry about discoloration because as soon as you heat that knife past the Curie point, the heat treat flies out the window anyhow."
Bladesmith,36fvee,shrikezulu,1 point,Tue May 19 03:51:06 2015 UTC,"The discoloration was a deep blue, almost black. Only the 1/8"" at the very tip was affected.

If this were your knife, what would be your next step?"
Bladesmith,36fvee,wkirbys,3,Tue May 19 04:02:40 2015 UTC,"The discoloration was a deep blue, almost black. Only the 1/8"" at the very tip was affected. Would I have had to grind away the whole section, all the way through? Or does the effect on the heat treat only go as deep as the discoloration?   you have to reprofile and remove the section that is discoloured.   I'm still not quite sure what to do. If this were your knife, what would be your next step?   Hard to say without seeing it, I would probably leave it, if its only blue it could still be 55+ rc which isnt such a bad thing at the tip of a knife, or I would reprofile it, I would avoid heat treating it if at all possible."
Bladesmith,36fvee,wkirbys,1 point,Tue May 19 04:31:33 2015 UTC,Does the effect on the heat treat only go as deep as the discoloration? As in: has the material around or under the discolored portion lost hardness as well?
Bladesmith,36fvee,shrikezulu,1 point,Tue May 19 11:45:52 2015 UTC,"No, that's why I'm saying you will have to reprofile the blade if you want to remove the effected area."
Bladesmith,36fvee,shrikezulu,2,Tue May 19 12:44:30 2015 UTC,"Just grind away the discoloration.  Reshape the tip so that it doesn't look wonky and continue with your grind.  Without any other factors getting in the way, a deep blue means you went past 500 degrees F, which is a temp more suited to axes and chopping tools. The file is already heat treated, so if your bevels are good, and the grind is good, then finish it up. If it were me?  I guess it depends on what I was looking to do.  If I were trying to learn, then I would reheat treat it.  I would grind it out how I wanted it to look, and then heat treat it. If I was just looking to make a knife, then I wouldn't worry about the heat treat since a file has an already excellent heat treat on it."

I'm assuming that you will need to purchase all of your equipment new, and this is about where I believe they would be priced at, at least for my location in California.  KMG Grinder: $1,800 (laid in) Drill Press: $400.00 Porta-bandsaw: $250.00 Small Bandsaw: $200.00 Buffer: $200.00 Wheel Grinder (X2): $500.00 (total) Sanding Belts (to start with): $300.00 (This price to gets a bunch that you can try, and figure out what works best for you.) Misc items, (buffer wheels, grinding wheels, sharpening hones): $500.00 Kiln: $1200.00 Heat Treat Oven: $150.00 Tools (Drill bits, jigs, hammers, etc, etc.) $500.00 Anvil: $300.00  That's about all I can think of off the top of my head. Bottom line, it's going to be an investment. But the thing that you will need to invent the most into, is your time.

Bladesmith,363zbz,TexanBlades,1 point,Sun May 17 12:30:34 2015 UTC,"That depends greatly upon the knife, and the maker. Jay Fisher's starting price at fixed blade knives is $1,000.00 - but, hey, a quick google image search for his name will show you how he can command that price. For me, a standard 8"" Chef knife is priced around $550.00 - a full on custom, built to specific weight, angle of grind and bevel with specific handle material, well that could get to $800.00 or so. But that is the top shelf knife, that I make at this time. My typical, ""bread and butter"" is a 5"" hunter, priced on average around $300.00..."

Bladesmith,363zbz,chickeninthewoods,1 point,Tue May 19 22:33:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you MUCH! It's been a journey for sure. In order to get to where I am in such a short time, and had to fully immerse myself. Spent the last few months joining and California Blacksmith Association and California Knife Makers Association and then going to every single class, shop, meeting and gathering I could. I quit my corporate job, put together funds and simply put 100% of my time and effort into knife making. I relax by watching instructional videos and reading instruction books. It has been what I eat, breath and think since I finished that knife. And, honestly without the full love and support of my family, I would have never of gotten this far. They have suffered through countless hours of knife making videos.... For pics, check out the gallery at www.jmgsteelworks.com - that's the latest and greatest of my stuff thus far.

I would hold off on a precision  cutter, unless you absolutely need that for the kind of knifes your making. (Folders?) For me, I found the band saw, drill press and belt grinder are absolute MUSTS. - Now, here is the fun part. Knife makes are ""makers"" by trade and type of person. Having said that, you can find free plans all over the place for building your own belt grinder and the such. For the cost of your time and elbow grease, you can significantly reduce your costs, but that will also increase you startup time, if the overall goal here is to make this a business.  -- I guess that is how most all things break down.

Bladesmith,362ohx,Benman415,1 point,Sat May 16 16:17:52 2015 UTC,I would advise you requench. To me it sounds like you grew out the grain. Grain refers to the average size of cemanite crystals in the steel. You want them to be as small as possible. It sounds like you heated the edge over past the 1550 point and grew the grain to large. Requench for safety sake. Large grain will make a knife snap in a second.

Bladesmith,35uxu8,doublesecretprobatio,1 point,Thu May 14 13:10:56 2015 UTC,"Seems like it! The process is usually called 'differential tempering' because the temper is changed on the spine only. The temper is usually done by watching the colors on the steel changed (caused by oxide layers growing on the surface, the thickness changes the color). Most people will temper to a blue color (around 600-700ºF) which indicates a 'spring' temper, a little less hard but also much tougher."

Bladesmith,35vqr7,Trevorh90,2,Wed May 13 22:29:17 2015 UTC,you'll need some sort of powered abrasive device like a belt sander
Bladesmith,35vqr7,thesirenlady,2,Wed May 13 22:46:30 2015 UTC,"So you think the edge is thick enough for heat treating, but the bevel still needs to be higher? I'd say just decrease the angle that you're filing at. You'll likely end up accidentally making a weirdly angled double bevel, so afterwards maybe clean it up and make it consistent with maybe an orbital sander or flap disk or something.   I wouldn't lose sleep over the possibility of warping or anything. Just go for it, consider it a learning experience. Stuff will happen, and it'll teach you something."

When you are done, you can send it back to me, I'll heat treat it and temper for you. Cost? The postage for you to send it to me. I won't charge ya.... What's the catch? It will take me a week or two to turn it around for you, as I'll anneal and heat treat during my normal runs, so the cost for me is pretty much zippo over what my normal cost is for doing my normal set of work."

Bladesmith,35uyem,daggerag,6,Wed May 13 18:54:09 2015 UTC,"have you done anything like this before, previous experience with forging, took a blacksmithing class, anything. if not, i would highly suggest against starting with swords. start smaller, a little simple straight edged knife and work your way up in complexity, hone your skills before you move up to the big show. you could waste a lot of good steel otherwise."

Then put a coat of just the refractory cement, and you have a pretty effective propane Forge. I'm about done with my build. I'll have to put some pics up this weekend."
Bladesmith,35vdsj,riversofgore,4,Wed May 13 20:50:59 2015 UTC,"You cannot heat a blade evenly using just a torch. You need to build a chamber (forge) to reflect and evenly distribute heat. This torch will also not work for that application, as the torch head will be a few inches into the forge and burnt gases will circulate into the air holes. This will drastically reduce burn temps, or simply put the flame out. You want a propane torch with air intakes at least 3 inches away from the tip of the torch, 4-5 inches would be better. Look up two brick forge, you can get porous fire brick from pretty much any pottery supply place, and some masonry supply stores. If you have any questions, shoot."
Bladesmith,35vdsj,UncleJehmimah,1 point,Wed May 13 22:44:51 2015 UTC,Is the brick method better than creating a forge using clay and a large metal coffee can?  Would this be a sufficient torch when used with a forge?  Any benefits to using the more expensive MAP gas over Propane?

Bladesmith,35vdsj,UncleJehmimah,1 point,Wed May 13 22:52:43 2015 UTC,"That's a good torch to use, although button start torches are needlessly expensive in my opinion. The two brick is easier than the coffee can method. Of course, if you have access to refactory cement and thermal blankets, but not porous fire brick, than the coffee can method may be better."
Bladesmith,35vdsj,UncleJehmimah,1 point,Wed May 13 23:06:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the cost of the torch would be the single most expensive item of everything I've purchased.  The brick seems the simplest so I think I'll pursue building that.  Thanks for all your help."
Bladesmith,35vdsj,Mobile_Version,2,Thu May 14 00:25:55 2015 UTC,"This would be just fine as well. It will heat the forge faster and likely more evenly since it's got a large flame. Plus, it costs half what the one you linked does. The only drawback is no button start, but using a lighter is no big deal."
Bladesmith,35v2uf,pok3salot,3,Wed May 13 19:28:39 2015 UTC,Probably not. I don't see the use in using an expensive material that is prone to corrosion (as high carbon steels are both) in a computer component that doesn't require any excessive degree of durability. It is probably aluminum or junk steel.
Bladesmith,35v2uf,kingswee,3,Wed May 13 20:00:14 2015 UTC,"Hard drive bodies and platters are generally made of Aluminum. The magnetic properties of the platters that lets them store data come from a micron thin layer of magnetic material on their surfaces. Aluminum is too soft to hold an edge. You could cut and grind a platter to make a letter opener, but nothing meant to stay sharp or cut well."
Bladesmith,35v2uf,denaissance,1 point,Wed May 13 20:37:01 2015 UTC,"Right, so platters are out, but the lid, the part that houses the manufacturer's sticker and not the little PCB, that part is steel, or at very least magnetic all throughout. /u/kingswee doesn't think it's high grade steel, and I'm inclined to agree, but if it's even decent I can live with that. It'd be my first knife, so it doesn't have to be D2 or anything. Just good enough to make it not garbage."
Bladesmith,35v2uf,allsortsofmeow,3,Wed May 13 21:52:17 2015 UTC,"If you want something usable, just fork out the 10-30 dollars for a bar of 440c or 1085.  edit: I don't feel you learn much working on a softer material knowing you won't get a practical end result.

Bladesmith,35v2uf,Idreamofmotorcycles,1 point,Thu May 14 00:44:23 2015 UTC,"If a magnet sticks to it then I'm wrong, but I was under the impression that the cases were aluminum too, specifically because steel would build up magnetic moment after prolonged exposure to powerful moving magnets. Also, because they are all made in Asia and aluminum is cheaper to ship. If I'm wrong, and it is steel, it may even be good steel, for its intended purpose, but not for holding an edge. Were you going to forge it or grind it?"
Bladesmith,35v2uf,tingting2,1 point,Thu May 14 13:35:10 2015 UTC,"I just wanted an idea of what it was. The cover plate is most definitely steel as a magnet sticks to it. Its shape is a little too weird to just grind outright so I think itd be at least pounded to shape. If I have to forge it I will, I just don't know what kind of steel I'm looking at and whether or not it would even be worth forging/grinding on the first place."

Sorry man, folks on this sub are usually much more constructive than this. I'd say your knife looks functional, if not beautiful. Which ain't bad for a first try.

Bladesmith,35s877,thesirenlady,2,Sat May 16 08:01:12 2015 UTC,Pins are definitely something you need. Without them the handle scales are subject to too much shifting from too many directions which inevitably weakens the epoxy.
Bladesmith,35s877,thesirenlady,0,Sun May 17 01:33:11 2015 UTC,"This is going to be compounded by how thin the knife is, since its going to flex and potentially pry the handle scales off by itself."
Bladesmith,35s877,allsortsofmeow,1 point,Thu May 14 23:07:15 2015 UTC,"It doesn't flex as much as you'd think. And the epoxy I used is rubbery, not brittle, so it can shift a little."

Bladesmith,35q9kw,aarongough,1 point,Tue May 12 19:11:47 2015 UTC,I got the scales from AKS and had them cut it down from a block into two scales because I don't have a band saw.
Bladesmith,35q9kw,perfunctificus,1 point,Tue May 12 20:01:19 2015 UTC,"The blade is 52100, heat treated by Bos services. Handle is stabilized box elder burl, with red g10 liners and a white pinstripe. The design is almost identical to a Bushfinger from Andy at Fiddleback forge.   I bought the leather sheath from a BF user named Bonafide, his sheaths are called JouFuu sheaths. I made the kydex sheath myself.   I ground the knife on a HF 1x30, as well as the bevel up to about 80%. Finished the main bevels using an Aaron Gough filing jig.   The blade is sanded to 600 grit. The spine and handle are sanded to 2000 grit, finished with 5 coats (very thin) of tru oil. Then ren wax buffed.   Things I did poorly: didn't clean the inside of the lanyard tubing. Didn't sand up into the pluge lines very well (some vertical scratches are visible), I went a little overboard with the contouring and ended up with the handle being slightly thinner than I would have liked. Also, there is a large knot in the wood on the other side, I believe it is visible in the last picture.   Please give honest feedback, I don't need to be sheltered from criticism.   Thanks!"
Bladesmith,35q9kw,perfunctificus,4,Tue May 12 17:06:10 2015 UTC,"Very well done mate! Was reading through your comment and was pleased to see mention of the filing jig, hope it worked well for you!

Bladesmith,35q9kw,bobasaurus,2,Tue May 12 19:43:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you Aaron. The filing jig worked well, one thing I didn't do right was the radius on the file (not enough). I was worried about not having defined plunge lines and ended up with plunge lines that were too square and hard to sand."
Bladesmith,35q9kw,RDalman,2,Tue May 12 20:03:38 2015 UTC,"The plunge lines are always the hardest to sand unfortunately. Rounding the edges of the file over more will really help to reduce the 'scratching' left in the plunge line by the file, and should significantly reduce your finishing time!"
Bladesmith,35q9kw,aarongough,1 point,Tue May 12 20:28:40 2015 UTC,"The handle contouring looks spot on, I would say any thicker would be too much bulk in the handle.  Everyone, myself included, seems to start off making chunky handles, you did well.  To clean the inside of your lanyard tubing, just get a wooden q-tip with a dab of liquid polish like scratch-x on it, and use a drill to spin it inside the tube, viola. Knots are part of the game with burl woods, fill with CA glue and finish flush is there is a void to be filled, otherwise call it character and don't worry about it.  Great looking work!  BF is stepping it up this week!"
Bladesmith,35q9kw,aarongough,2,Tue May 12 17:40:20 2015 UTC,"That is a great idea for cleaning the lanyard tube. I ruined a .22 bore brush already trying to do that. Where do you get wooden q-tips, I mean where brick and mortar, im sure i can find them online."

Bladesmith,35s6d7,LIVE2KILL,3,Wed May 13 01:42:36 2015 UTC,"Depends on pin layout and personal preference.  if you want to use small pins, put them at a set distance from the outside of the handle  You can use two 1/4"" pins to emulate the loveless/corby bolt look  you can do a hidden tang with a single pin of almost any size between 3/32 and 1/4  IMHO the only layout you want to avoid is 3 pins, of 3/16"" or smaller. as it looks very amateur and boring. But it works a lot better with tubing, or something worth featuring."
Bladesmith,35s6d7,thesirenlady,1 point,Wed May 13 03:00:32 2015 UTC,"May I just say I love you for having picture examples. Also, the plan is to do some mosaic pins. Are the pins from the tubing pic and mosaic pin pic 1/4? I like the size of those."
Bladesmith,35s6d7,thesirenlady,1 point,Wed May 13 03:15:07 2015 UTC,Yeah those would be 1/4 i think. I know you can get them smaller than that but i think theyre a bit of a waste.  some people make their own but ever since china started making them theyre much cheaper.

Bladesmith,35otsv,shrikezulu,1 point,Wed May 13 01:25:32 2015 UTC,"A2, and A7 are air cooling steels and do not heat treat anywhere near to what O1 heat treats.  H steels are high speed steels, and they heat treat even differently than the A steels and O steels.    Since you don't have any scrap left over, you are just shooting in the dark.  You can try heat treating for one of the A steels, since they don't require a quench and if they get hard, then there you go.  If it doesn't get hard by air, then it is a steel that needs quenching."
Bladesmith,35otsv,thesirenlady,1 point,Tue May 12 16:05:11 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I will do, if it does not harden after using air will I be able to reheat the steel and oil quench?"
Bladesmith,35otsv,shrikezulu,1 point,Tue May 12 21:24:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can.  But again, you have to weigh this against whether you want to invest lots of time into mystery steel.  Air cooling steels require that you heat the steel up fairly high (~1800 F) which is way past the austenizing point, and will induce grain growth in the steel if it is not air cooling steel.  If it isn't air cooling, once you heat this hot you will need to normalize the steel before quenching it otherwise the steel will be weak with huge grain."
Bladesmith,35otsv,yangxiaodong,1 point,Tue May 12 23:22:44 2015 UTC,This was a test run for the entire process.

Bladesmith,35oenk,PM_me_your_lemon,3,Tue May 12 04:55:33 2015 UTC,You'll get varying opinions on stabalising. Personally I would rather use pre stabalised wood or just not use wood at all. Dense harwoods like ebony and teak would probably be ok with maybe just a little oil. Something like maple or box elder you defdenitely want to put atleast some Arm-R-Seal or something on. Just my two cents.
Bladesmith,35oenk,thezep,3,Tue May 12 17:02:11 2015 UTC,What exactly does it mean to stabilize wood?
Bladesmith,35oenk,Msmith589,3,Tue May 12 18:34:42 2015 UTC,A commercial wood hardener or resin is forced into the pours of the wood in a vacuum chamber.

Bladesmith,35oenk,Msmith589,4,Tue May 12 23:36:19 2015 UTC,"DIY stabilizing is a con.  dont care how much vaccum pressure you can pull with your dinky little pump, you're not doing the same thing as a commercial stabilizing company.  I have a few mates that do it and you look at the wood and it still has checks and voids and they'll say 'yeah it still moves a bit afterwards', so why'd you do it in the first place?!  speaking stabilizing in general, if you go by all the rhetoric you see on forums today, youd think wood was just going to spontatneously combust if its not stabilised. Truth is some woods pretty much need it like black palm or spalted maple, others its not required like koa, and quite a few woods wont even take it like desert ironwood or ringed gidgee"
Bladesmith,35oenk,thesirenlady,2,Wed May 13 00:47:26 2015 UTC,"I have a vacuum clave for carbon fiber fabrication, and even that doesn't work too well for me when I try to stabilize wood.

Bladesmith,35ksss,thesirenlady,1 point,Mon May 11 11:55:39 2015 UTC,An easy way to do it is to get some pcb transfer paper or any paper laser toner wont stick to like magazine paper then print your design and iron it on and etch as needed.
Bladesmith,35ksss,wkirbys,1 point,Mon May 11 16:54:06 2015 UTC,would i iron it onto the knife?
Bladesmith,35ksss,wkirbys,1 point,Tue May 12 01:13:58 2015 UTC,Yep. There is a bit of a knack to getting all the toner to transfer.  Once it's on you should soak for a while and slowly break away the paper so not to pull off any of the toner.
Bladesmith,35jlbb,allsortsofmeow,2,Mon May 11 00:17:22 2015 UTC,I'm not really sure how to answer this except to make the bevels how you want them to be.

Bladesmith,35gkp7,yangxiaodong,3,Sun May 10 03:40:09 2015 UTC,"machete.... a knife that's around 18 inches   Just to be clear, machete does not mean long knife.  A machete is a light chopper primarily intended for hacking at vegetation.  There's a lot of kinds and tons of variation but according to the Knife Definitions Almanac According To Me, they all have one thing in common:  they're thin enough to flex the blade easily.  You'll find things trying to pass for machetes but they're really just big knives that are too thick for machete work.  If you're not making something that fits that definition please disregard the rest.  Production machetes are mostly 1070 or something similar.  They're not very hard.  They're often shipped without a real edge and are sharpened by poor people using rocks, cinder blocks, or other rubble.  They're also used to whack things all day.  For these reasons they need to be soft enough to sharpen easily and not shatter when you whack something tough.  So as far as what to use for steel, obviously it has to be something that you're able to heat treat or send out for heat treat.  I'll assume you can make good choices there.  You want to hit maybe 50 Rc.  O-1 seems like a great choice to me mainly because it's available in so many thicknesses.  Amtek has O-1 as thin as 1/64""."
Bladesmith,35gkp7,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Sun May 10 05:36:15 2015 UTC,"I had thought they were supposed to be like an axe. Rephrased, would o1 work in a blade 3/10ths of an inch thick, 18 inches long in total, that will be used for hqcking limbs off of trees, cutting wood and doing other cool stuff."
Bladesmith,35gkp7,Fargraven,2,Sun May 10 12:35:02 2015 UTC,3/10 of an inch is larger than 1/4. That's pretty massive.
Bladesmith,35gkp7,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Sun May 10 12:44:35 2015 UTC,Yeah.  Im planning on using super thin micarta or oak for the handle.

Bladesmith,35gkp7,Verrence,1 point,Sun May 10 13:03:20 2015 UTC,"How are you planning on heat treating?  There are easier steels to HT than O1, especially when it's going to be that size.  Might want to go with a simple carbon steel, 10xx."
Bladesmith,35gkp7,Verrence,1 point,Sun May 10 05:16:20 2015 UTC,"On that note it would probably be better to use something like 1065. You'll want to have a lot of flexibility in a blade for a machete considering how long and thin it is, as well as its intended use."

Bladesmith,3593sc,cuntpuncher_69,4,Fri May 8 09:41:11 2015 UTC,Aesthetilly 2. As a designer/photographer its compositionally moe fulfilling.
Bladesmith,3593sc,bodez95,1 point,Fri May 8 08:00:48 2015 UTC,"I struggled with this mindset as well. Odd numbers balance well (my view on 3 pins), though 2 pins visually divides the handle into thirds.   It has become a harder choice than I expected."
Bladesmith,3593sc,thesirenlady,2,Fri May 8 09:30:40 2015 UTC,Yeah it does if you space them evenly like that. Thats what i meant when i said a bit further apart
Bladesmith,3593sc,beige_trousers,8,Fri May 8 09:40:27 2015 UTC,Personally I'd go with 2
Bladesmith,3593sc,thesirenlady,5,Fri May 8 03:49:35 2015 UTC,"2, a little bit further apart.  IMO there are very few instances where 3 pins really works aesthetically. There are many examples where the 3 pins will form a straight line and obstruct the overall aesthetic flow of the knife. some other examples where they are not straight but averaged out in the middle of the handle and essentially form a wave pattern.  2 pins or 2 pins and a lanyard is classic and elegant, enough to hold on any handle material, and harder to screw up."
Bladesmith,3593sc,MrOFoxy,3,Fri May 8 04:28:04 2015 UTC,2 has a charm to me.

Bladesmith,3535qg,puckets,14,Wed May 6 18:40:47 2015 UTC,"unfortunately, that might be rusted and pitted beyond repair, you'll have to remove so much material to make it functional again. on that close-up of the inner curve, the edge itself has entire chunks missing, from the pitting.  still, you might try electrolysis to get the rust off, and when that's done you can see how it looks and decide whether you're willing to grind down and reprofile the edge enough to make it cut again. If it's a truly old knife, it may be worth more without any restoration work done at all. If it's only a few decades old and just hasn't been well taken care of, restoration might be worth a shot."
Bladesmith,3535qg,ghostmcspiritwolf,6,Wed May 6 19:02:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Ill try to figure out its age.

Bladesmith,353wo3,Msmith589,1 point,Wed May 6 22:03:47 2015 UTC,"Well... what wood are we talking about?  Some woods take a fine polish all by themselves.  This includes ebony, rosewoods, cocobolo, etc and most (all?) stabilized woods.  A generally safe bet is to sand to at least 600 (so, 120, 220, 320, 400, 600, maybe 1200), then apply Danish oil (let fully dry), then some wax product (Johnson's, etc) and buff that out by hand.  The wax step is optional but gives a good feel.  It can leave visible wax in pores if you haven't filled the grain some how.  If you only apply oil then it's straight forward to reapply later.  The intended use of the knife matters too.  The above is what I do, but I only make kitchen knives."
Bladesmith,353wo3,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Thu May 7 06:27:17 2015 UTC,"Lacquer isn't really a good idea for knife handles imo, if it cracks or scratches it can lock moisture in the handle. I usually sand to a high grit, sometimes buff a little. Then I do 3-5 very thin coats of danish oil, takes about a week, let it harden properly and then buff. You don't want a layer on top of the wood, you want the treatment just IN the surface."
Bladesmith,353wo3,RDalman,0,Thu May 7 22:00:43 2015 UTC,"Sand paper. Start with 40 grit and work with each steps (60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 180, 220, 300, etc) until you hit 1500 grit, then rub with very fine steel wool, then poly."
Bladesmith,353wo3,gnuhigh,8,Wed May 6 23:56:21 2015 UTC,"Start with 40 grit and work with each steps (60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 180, 220, 300, etc)   Goodness, no.  40 grit will put some deep, deep scratches that you'll spend time sanding out.  Start with the highest grit that can still remove the machining marks.  Usually this is 120 or 220 for me.  Then 320, 400, 600, 1200 ... you can probably skip either 320 or 400 but I do it out of habit.  There is no need to use every grit available.  The general rule is you can double the grit for each step."
Bladesmith,353wo3,obeythehypnotoad,0,Thu May 7 06:31:32 2015 UTC,"At higher grits, I recommend wet sanding as this will do something to fill in gaps created at lower grits. This will also allow you to wipe away excess material as you work."

Bladesmith,3529ef,FJ1906,-2,Wed May 6 14:43:42 2015 UTC,don't waste your money on a 1x30 thinking you will bevel with it.  i've tried and i went back to hand beveling.  i do switch to it after filing the majority of the bevel to take out the big tool marks and prep for heat treat.  i wouldn't touch a treated blade to it.  it's decent for rough shaping handles and setting edges though.  if you don't have the patience to cut a good bevel by hand this is probably the wrong hobby for you.
Bladesmith,3529ef,doublesecretprobatio,3,Wed May 6 17:49:24 2015 UTC,i bevel with my harbor freight 1x30 absolutely fine. Flat grinds across 12 inch blade come out exactly as intended. And i hate using a fucking gig so its all free hand.
Bladesmith,3529ef,Jackel1994,1 point,Wed May 6 21:52:03 2015 UTC,"You need patience to cut bevels with an electric grinder as well. You need to know that even though you can go much faster, you shouldn't. I only grind 2-3 times faster using a grinder than I do with a filing jig. I don't need to do a heck of a lot of finishing work following the initial grind. You just need more practice with your 1x30 it sounds like."

Bladesmith,3529ef,nipzx,5,Wed May 6 20:47:38 2015 UTC,"Not sure why youd say that at all. Every bladesmith you will see uses a grinder or a belt sander that isnt water fed. Grind it with ur hand using some thin gloves and when it gets hot, dip it into a bucket."
Bladesmith,3529ef,Jackel1994,1 point,Wed May 6 21:53:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info I've been avoiding using my belt grinder on my work bc I thought it would ruin the heat treat
Bladesmith,3529ef,nipzx,1 point,Thu May 7 01:05:12 2015 UTC,It certainly will if you arnt careful. If it gets too hot to hold in your hands then you are really pushing the limits of the heat treat holding up. And on the edge or near the tip will overheat very fast.. Watch for that straw color metal turns as thats the sign you are seriously ruining the treating.
Bladesmith,3529ef,Jackel1994,2,Thu May 7 03:02:02 2015 UTC,"That is completely false. I fight the problem of over heating by intermittently cooling the blade with water before it gets too hot. There, problem solved, and it cost me zero extra dollars."

Bladesmith,34xcez,brightside03,33,Tue May 12 23:24:57 2015 UTC,"Originally, laminating or pattern welding distributed the impurities in the steel more evenly, resulting in higher overall quality and a blade less likely to break. However, after the development of high quality steel, the main point is aestethic or to demonstrate that the smith is capable of making a laminated or pattern welded blade."
Bladesmith,34xcez,avataRJ,9,Tue May 5 12:07:39 2015 UTC,"Spot on.  The modern pattern welded damascus is really nice-looking, I bought this piece at a knife show a few years back:  http://imgur.com/dKION22  Someday I'll make a nice folder out of it."
Bladesmith,34xcez,bobasaurus,4,Tue May 5 21:20:12 2015 UTC,"I thought that by folding higher-carbon and lower-carbon steels together, you get both toughness and hardness properties of each steel. Why wouldn't that be the case? Genuinely curious."
Bladesmith,34xcez,bonoboner,7,Tue May 5 23:09:30 2015 UTC,"yeah thats sort of what he's saying, but blurring the lines between folding and drawing in order to distribute impurities like you'd see in bloom steel vs combining already refined high carbon steel(a more valuable and rare resource) with already refined low or mid carbon steel which is more common.  when you do combine them for a mixture of properties its either by a laminate(hard edge, soft backing) or by folding enough for them to become a homogenous material. a low layer count damascus blade does not achieve the same thing."
Bladesmith,34xcez,thesirenlady,1 point,Wed May 6 00:25:54 2015 UTC,"Though correct, I'd like to say that a bladesmith of optimal skill, say a master blade smith, can and do create extraordinarily performing blades by laminating different high quality modern steels."

Bladesmith,34xcez,the_pragmaticist,12,Tue May 5 12:11:50 2015 UTC,"While the word ""exactly"" protects your statement, the general idea is well understood.  It's no huge mystery.  They took iron ore and various vegetation (tree material, flowers, bushes) and heated it in an underground kiln for weeks at a time.  The specific vegetation chosen happened to contain chromium, molybdenum, silicon, and the other various carbide precursors you've undoubtedly heard of in modern steel, in addition to plenty of carbon.  Those trace elements melded with the iron to form a remarkably good steel.    The real mystery is how they figured it out in the first place."

It is on page 38 of The Art Of Blacksmithing on of the most widely publishe books on the topic  ""As with blister steel wootz steel was made by carburizing pure iron. instead of using charcoal as a source of carbon however, the Oriental steelmakers use molten cast iron with high carbon content. a faggot of pure iron plates was immersed in the crucible of molten cast iron, by capillary action the highly carburized cast iron was drawn between the plates of pure iron and the pure iron was heated almost to melting point it absorbed more carbon the mass was then allowed to harden into an ingot which was worked in to tools and weapons. Wootz steel, though more easily tempered, was hard to forge which may clarify the Oriental technique of shaping swords and axes and knives with a minimum smithing. European Smiths found the Wootz steel cannot be worked below a blood red heat. if it was the metal ""red seared"" or cracked just as pure iron will worked at any heat between blue and sunrise red""  Edit: rotten writin' written rotten"

Bladesmith,34vqio,iolithblue,2,Tue May 5 01:01:30 2015 UTC,"Are these actual bones, or ""whalebone"" as baleen is commonly referred to? Either way, probably not. There are numerous laws governing the hunting, collecting, and use of materials from marine mammals around the world. If you are in the US,  that would fall under the auspice of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and if neither you nor the friend selling are Alaskan Natives, the answer is absolutely not, unless you can prove (hard to do) that the whale you got the bone from was killed before 1972.   Even so, bones are pretty much the same all around from species to species, other than size. I know camel bone is commonly available from knife making suppliers and is probably much cheaper and indistinguishable from whale.

Bladesmith,34nufr,Benman415,1 point,Mon May 11 19:00:59 2015 UTC,"I use foot (and a half) long chunk of rail. I drilled a hardie hole using a similar method to the one outlinded by /u/boomboom4132. I use a a round of pine as a stand. I've hollowed out three mounting points for the piece of rail so I can:    Stand it on end. Leave it standing upright on it's flat base. Roll it upside down so the flat base is on top.   This gives me a great range of hammering surfaces. It's not normal, but I can work efficiently with it and I think it cost me around $10. Granted, I have no idea where you would get a nice short piece of rail (since mostly they come in 8-10 foot sections). While you can find loads of the stuff on abandoned rail lines, you'd still need to cut it to size. I got mine from a friend, so I can't speak to how he cut it."

I bought it pretty much new and if I sell it in 20 years it will probably be worth just as much. A good anvil should have a hardened steel face.

Bladesmith,34iyhl,Na3s,1 point,Fri May 1 17:52:07 2015 UTC,It is gun blue. You can find retouch kits that have the bluing agent in cream form.  I applied a base coat of blue then went back over it with the lines letting them sit on the blade for like ten minutes before removing the blue.
Bladesmith,34iyhl,sigurbjorn1,2,Fri May 1 20:56:01 2015 UTC,What is happening with that steel? It is stunning. Ive never seen anything quite like it.
Bladesmith,34gs2g,VaguelyHonest,13,Fri May 1 00:46:08 2015 UTC,It's not too uncommon to do this. It's usually called a zero grind and a lot of Scandinavian (scandi) ground knives have it. It's also fairly common on knives with a convex grind.   The main reason for the bevels on modern knives are for ease of manufacture and sharpening by the user. It also thickens up the knife behind the edge to strengthen it. A flat zero grind on a Spyderco tenacious would most likely leave the edge too thin to be used on a tough material.
Bladesmith,34gs2g,triILL,2,Fri May 1 00:59:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Makes a lot if sense, i was thinking it had something to do with strength/reinforcement but wasn't thinking about manufacturing costs. Thanks!"
Bladesmith,34gs2g,GrinderMonkey,1 point,Fri May 1 01:25:40 2015 UTC,"A zero grind is usually pretty delicate for any kind of heavy work.  Also, it's hard to grind without blowing the temper post heat treat.  If you've got a 3/4 grind on a narrow blade, it's much more friendly (think a scandi or a katana.)  I've got a zero ground kris blade butterfly lying around...  scary as fuck, but if you drop it once, it's done."
Bladesmith,34gs2g,poorfolkbows,2,Fri May 1 04:01:32 2015 UTC,"I used to do my knives that way, but I quit doing it because I figure once you sharpen it a second time after some use, you're going to have to put a secondary bevel on there anyway or else you'd have to grind the edge all over again, which seems excessive."
Bladesmith,34gs2g,free_will_is_arson,1 point,Fri May 1 05:11:19 2015 UTC,"i tried a few and came to same conclusion, it just seemed kinda wasteful too. if every time you have to sharpen your knife you have sharpen the entire face of both sides of the blade, that's all material removed unnecessarily that will shorten the over lifespan of the knife. rather than taking the edge down a thousandth or whatever you take that from both sides of the face. how long until there's not enough left there for you to work with and you have to retire the knife."
Bladesmith,34gs2g,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Fri May 1 21:33:04 2015 UTC,Say you wanted 30 degree included angle at the edge. Imagine what a knife would look like with a 30 degree bevel.
Bladesmith,34gs2g,PValBlanc,1 point,Sun May 3 19:54:07 2015 UTC,"Of course there is a median compromise solving the aforementioned issues. Some knives will have a zero grind on one side of the blade with a slight sharpening bevel on the other. You sharpen on one side, the simply polish off the burr on the other. You still end up with a pretty fine and fragile edge, but it is primarily used for precision blades with a specific set of uses, rather than an all-around knife. Most good examples of this are in Japanese knives; both the Kiridashi and Usuba come to mind."
Bladesmith,34cpqb,t_F_,8,Thu Apr 30 02:26:26 2015 UTC,"I will answer assuming you want to do it by stock removal, or grinding away at a stock piece of steel.   Get a high carbon steel like 1084. There are fancier steels, but there is a good chance you might totally mess up at first, and even if you don't you probably want to make your first knives out of something cheap and easy to work with. High carbon steels have good characteristics for blades, except they patina and rust, which can be avoided by cleaning and oiling after use. Another one I see often recommended is o1 steel. Aaron Gough uses that if I remember right, and he has great instructional videos on youtube you can find by googling him.  I get my steel from newjerseysteelbaron.com. I highly recommend this. He sells tons of types, at good prices and convenient quantities and great service. Don't buy a steel that is too thick, 1/8 is good for a first knife. You should probably not make a giant knife at first, but a smallish one, as it takes forever to remove stock unless you have the right machinery, and it is good to start with filing by hand to learn."
Bladesmith,34cpqb,sandmansleepy,2,Thu Apr 30 03:38:06 2015 UTC,"I was actually hoping to hammer something out for the time being, as I only have materials for that and a grinder.

Rebar is fine to practice banging away and for turning into hooks and such. If you want to use scarp metal, look for old (really old)saw blades, chisels and files. They will have half decent steel."

Bladesmith,34amc5,Szervetlen,3,Wed Apr 29 17:00:19 2015 UTC,"Pretty happy with how this one turned out, re-did the profile two times before I was happy. I am not sure if I like the angle where the blade enters the handle, I think maybe a slight curve would look better. The handle looked a bit long compared to the knife so i cut off 1.5cm at the butt, I think that turned out better."
Bladesmith,34amc5,kliman,2,Wed Apr 29 17:04:33 2015 UTC,"Do you have any progress pics?  How thick is the steel for the blade (looks really thin), and did that cause you any trouble during HT? Looks great, by the way.  Love the handle."
Bladesmith,34amc5,kliman,2,Wed Apr 29 20:03:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  No process pics unfortunately.  The steel was some leftover 3mm o1. Because my first knife turned out a little too thik in my opinion i spendt a lot of time grinding it pretty thin. The thickness of the spine is 2.5mm near the handle, but it tapers in a straight line towards the tip. I took it down to 0.3 - 0.5 mm at the edges before heat treat. Most people recommend at least 0.5, but i ground it a little bit to far in some places and wanted it to be even. O1 is supposed to be pretty stable during heat treat, and there was no warp. I also heat treated two pretty long and thin 2mm CS75 steel knives at the same time, they warped a little bit, but I managed to straighten them OK.  I also ground it a bit after heat treat, the thickness at the edge before sharpening was 0.2-0.3mm."
Bladesmith,34amc5,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:16:27 2015 UTC,"I haven't done that type of handle (yet).  I know there's a taper on the blade and it's kind of ""tapped"" in to place...is there also epoxy involved?"
Bladesmith,34amc5,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:50:00 2015 UTC,"I drilled and burned the hole and filled with epoxy afterwards, its not a perfect method but it works.

But Ive watched people make a forge using a hair dryer and a shitty charcoal grill; your design looks better than that! You're burying it in the ground, so there will be plenty of insulation.   I would say do it and see how it works. Adjust your design as needed. Best thing about your plan for this project is that it will cost you very little money; if it doesnt work, you wont be too sad. lol"

Bladesmith,349sy1,Fargraven,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:37:18 2015 UTC,"The 2'x3' chamber is where I'll push the coals and is where the actual forge will be. The firepit is just for starting the fire, because it's difficult to create a fire in such a small place. After I get a decent fire going I'll push the coals down into the forge proper, then start on low with the blower and raise the power as I add more wood until I'm able to properly heat the steel.  Also, it's going to be roughly cylindrical, and I have plenty of things to cover the various holes with for when it's not in use."

Bladesmith,346acl,ohwhyhello,2,Tue Apr 28 17:17:20 2015 UTC,"You should do the grind before heat treatment. It is difficult to remove material after hardening.  Yes you can do different grinds with a filing jig. I have used a filing jig and just stopped earlier to make different grinds, and it works great. I have never tried a true scandi grind, but it should work. I always use a sharpie to mark the steel after measuring out where I want the grind to be to make sure I get the contours I want. I then just file down only where the marks are.   Just have a distance from the tangent of the curve be the same to get a scandi grind, and grind down almost all the way. You want to do the final grinding after heat treatment.  The type of filing jig that aaron gough uses though works great. I don't have one as complicated as his, I just have a single board, but you can do all kinds of grinds."
Bladesmith,346acl,sandmansleepy,2,Tue Apr 28 19:53:19 2015 UTC,I could use the same file jig most people do for flat grinds and just stop earlier.   not really. you need a much greater angle than that used on a regular blade. so the eyebolt guide either has to be really close or really high

Bladesmith,346acl,thesirenlady,2,Wed Apr 29 02:26:54 2015 UTC,you'll have to break out some high school trigonometry to figure that out. angle is generally in the area of 25 degrees. work from there.
Bladesmith,346acl,Fargraven,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:32:11 2015 UTC,"Do the grind before, but leave about 1mm of material so it doesn't warp. Trollskyy has a video about a very simple bevel jig, but it's kind of arbitrary and won't give you exact angles, like the more complex ones."
Bladesmith,345pe7,mattbpkt,3,Tue Apr 28 14:42:16 2015 UTC,D2 tool steel. Used in Dies for pressing and cutting machines.  If you're lucky you can find some on eBay that is pre hardened and has come out of a cutting die that needs new blades.
Bladesmith,345pe7,Scuzzbag,2,Tue Apr 28 19:51:45 2015 UTC,"i know 12c27 lists skate blades as one of its applications   What happens to it if it's not heat treated, so lets say I cut the blade from S110V and just sharpen it, is it too brittle or is it still better then heat treated 440C?    absolutely not. untreated steel is useless.  I dont think prehardened is going to work for you. firstly because its not really common. second because it probably wont have the finish you want, and you dont want to be refinishing hardened s110v.  if you have to weld on a fixture then you'll get major weld embrittlement, which can be mostly solved if heat treating after.  bear in mind, this is coming from an aussie. ive been to the snow once in my life, dad took us there on a whim in shorts and tshirts. can we go home now?"
Bladesmith,345pe7,thesirenlady,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:35:40 2015 UTC,OK. What about the steel that is sold as small pieces for knife making - do the guys that use it to cut the final piece typically heat treat it afterwards?  Does hardening or heat treatment process change the dimensions of the final piece as far as thickness or any other tolerance in the dimension?
Bladesmith,345pe7,thesirenlady,2,Wed Apr 29 02:44:32 2015 UTC,do the guys that use it to cut the final piece typically heat treat it afterwards?   The fuck did i just say? lol   untreated steel is useless.   untreated steel has much the same properties as mild steel in terms of durability and flexibility.  its very easy to send out the blades to a professional heat treater though.  Theres a little bit of dimensional movement but nothing youd notice for your application.

Bladesmith,341yc2,_Magna,9,Mon Apr 27 17:53:50 2015 UTC,"I got some ferric chloride at Radio Shack, and diluted it 50/50 with water.  I put the blades in for about a minute, then sprayed them with windex to neutralize the acid, then rinsed them off, dried them with a paper towel, and let them sit for an hour.  Then I took a 3"" PVC sewer pipe, cut off 10 inches of it, and glued a cap at one end.  I put some glass marbles in it that I got at the dollar store.  Then I put the knife in there (I used to do two or three at once, but discovered I got much better results doing one at a time).  I put a cap on the other end and taped it on with duct tape. Then I wrapped that in a flannel sheet (a towel would work, too).  I duct taped that so it would stay together and put it in the dryer with some other laundry for padding.

Bladesmith,341yc2,nootay,-1,Mon Apr 27 22:35:55 2015 UTC,"To be pedantic, this is acid washing or etched stonewashing.  Stonewashing or tumbling is a process used by industry to remove machining marks and burrs and create a consistent surface on a part that would otherwise be very difficult to hand polish.   for the home smith using it on satin finished blades its definitely not a shortcut and it doesnt really cover flaws!"

Note that the tempering temperature/effect depends on the hardening temperature.   You don't state what equipment you're using for hardening or tempering. I'm guessing you were actually lower than 430F. You can always retemper at a higher temperature. I would bump it up another 25 degrees and see if that gets closer to the desired hardness."

Bladesmith,33ucxi,Iokua_CDN,3,Sat Apr 25 18:36:48 2015 UTC,A wrench is not a hardenable steel. Next time get some of Aldo 1084
Bladesmith,33s2lh,GraUlv,17,Sat Apr 25 02:04:22 2015 UTC,"When I first started making knives about 15 years ago I started without a belt grinder. In fact, I believe that a real cheep grinder will tend to stunt your basic knife making foundation. Begin at the very beginning. Acquire the following :  A fairly big steel pan. Get one at the Goodwill.  12"" x 12"" x 3"" deep. Don't be fussy. You probably already have one that you can use already at home.   A length of 1084 / 1075 / 15N20 steel in 1/ 8 "" thick or less. Buy it from Aldo at The New Jersey Steel Baron. Aldo is easy to find on google.   A pattern drawn on paper.  A drill  Some handle material from Jantz Supply.   Some three piece rivets from Jantz.   A hand hacksaw.   Some files.   Some sandpaper   A magnet   A mapp or propane torch.   Two gallons of canola oil.  A small / medium /large vice of some kind.  Some small ""C""  clamps   Some determination and patience.   Glue the pattern to the steel with glue or paste. Let dry or help it  along with a hairdryer.  Drill the rivet holes FIRST! You will have to figger the rivet hole sizes for the steel part and the handle material part. The people at Jantz will help. This will take some effort on your part. Try not to do this part more than two or three times (noam sayin'? Be careful here and pay attention to what you are doing)   Cut out the shape with the hand hacksaw.   Clean up the shape with the files. Use your vice here too.   Mark where you want the handle to terminate with a Sharpie on the steel.   Clamp your handle material to the steel. This is one side only. Scratch out the shape of the steel onto the handle material. Use a small flat blade screwdriver or something that will give you a good outline of the steel. Match drill the rivet holes. Go back above and read the part about not screwing this part up. Pay attention and THINK a little bit here. Try to remember that you DO have a small particle of a brain. I sincerely hope that you hear the bitter voice of experience speaking.   Do the same thing for the other side.   Cut out the handle material with the hacksaw.   Mark the front end of the handle material with the Sharpie and trim with  the hacksaw.   Stop with the handle material shaping and put aside for now.   Clamp the blade to a work board and begin the process of cutting in the major bevel with the files. This is the difficult part that you will work on for a very long time. I believe that this process is brother to prayer and meditation. If mystery there be to making knives here is where it lives. It can, these days, be easily beaten with technology but I have equipped YOU with a file. Do this now. Be as gentle with yourself as you would be with a good friend. Anger, impatientience and expectations of perfection are your enemies. Harmony and a beginner's mind are what you seek.   Turn and inspect often.   File until the ""cutting"" edge is the thickness of a credit card plus a business card. About 0.030"". The major bevel should, in my opinion, extend to the top of the blade. Not one third up or one half way up - all the way to the top of the blade.   Try to maintain symmetry. Ha! But give it the ole Airborne try. Keep your mind nicely clear.   Fill the pan with the canola oil. Suspend the magnet with a string from the ceiling.   Vicegrip the blade at the butt end and fire up the torch and begin to ""paint"" the blade. Be as even as possible. Don't over heat the tip and the edge. You want a nice, even temperature rise all alone the blade.   When you get a good, yellow color move the blade to the magnet. Once the magnet no longer sticks to the blade you are about 100 degrees F from where you want to be. It will take about another 45 seconds to raise the temperature of the blade to 1475 - 1500 degrees F.   At 1475 - 1500 degrees F plunge the blade (cutting edge down) into the canola oil.  Move the blade front to back in the oil until it has cooled to the temperature of the oil.   Take a file and try to file or cut the top of the blade. The file should not cut or dig into the steel it should skate like it would on glass.   I am tired of this! I am doing it on an 8"" tablet. I have a bit more. Do you want to hear it? Or am I wasting everyone's time? I will finish if you want me to. Let me know."
Bladesmith,33s2lh,gnique,3,Sat Apr 25 07:47:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this! Very nice walkthrough! I've always had the bug in the back of my head telling me to try and do this, after reading this and seeing the materials list and how-to, I think this summer I might have to"
Bladesmith,33s2lh,GeneralAnesthesia,2,Sat Apr 25 13:10:30 2015 UTC,"much appreciated sir,i should  have mentioned  that  stock removal method is what i  have  been  doing as  of  now    I  do appreciate  the  experienced  tips  though  and  will apply  them,  thanks.:)"
Bladesmith,33s2lh,gnique,3,Sat Apr 25 10:48:38 2015 UTC,"Hello again. I am at my MacBook at my desk so typing is much easier. Thank you for the uplifting comments. Here goes with the next step:  You should have a shaped and hardened blade that is ready for clean up with sand paper and a roughed out set of scales (handles - one for each side) and a set of rivets (I personally like three rivets spaced along the length of the handle).  Dry fit the scales to the blade with the rivets to make sure that everything fits together. This is just a fit up; nothing should be pretty yet.  If everything fits you are ready to work on the blade to get it cleaned up and as pretty and shiny as you are willing to work on. Reclamp the blade to the work board and begin the sanding process. A good grit to start with is 80. You should use metal finishing sandpaper that you can get a Lowe's or The Home Depot. The trick here is to remove the file marks and replace them with the sandpaper marks. The next step is 120 then 240 then 400 grits. Go to 1000 if you want to it is, after all, YOUR knife. Don't forget to get the top or the spine of the blade.  Match the two scales together with the rivets. The rivets should pull and hold the scales together so that the front end of the handle can be cleaned up and finished.  Put the scales in the vice with the front end sticking up in the air so that they can be completely finished. Hear me out on this step, please because once you get those scales riveted and epoxied to the blade it is IMPOSSIBLE to work on the front end. The front end must be completely and finally finished. The back part of the scales can be easily shaped and finished after they are attached permenately to the blade but the front is completely inaccessible after attachment. Also, both scales must be shaped and finished together. Treat the pair of scales as if they were a single unit.  One thing that I forgot to tell you to get at Lowe's is two part J-B Weld. This two part epoxy is just about as good as you can buy. Don't worry about anything better yet. Use J-B Weld. and get a small can of Acetone for JBW clean up. Score the insides of the scales with your small screwdriver. just scratch the fire out of both surfaces make it look as ugly as you can. Don't scratch within 1/4"" of any edge.  Mix the JBW at 1:1 and apply to the scales. Poke some JBW into the rivet holes with the threaded part of the rivets. Line up all the holes and put everything together - two scales, blade and three rivets. This is going to take some manipulation and it is messy. You might want to consider NOT doing this in the kitchen. When you are tightening the rivets remember that this is two epoxy so you DO NOT want to squeeze all of the epoxy out of the space between the blade and the scales. Tighten the screws but leave some room wherein some epoxy may dwell. Also, remember to completely clean and remove all JBW from the front of the handle because it's the same old song and story - you can't get at the front end once the JBW has hardened.  Set the whole assembly aside for a full day. This is good for you and your proto-knife. Wait a full day before you attack the handle to make it pretty.  I forgot to tell you to get some rolls of sandpaper strips (about 1"" wide) at Harbor Freight. Get the four grit dispenser box if they have it. Try to get 80, 120, 240 and 400 grit rolls. You are going to use 12"" lengths of 1"" wide sandpaper to ""shoe shine"" the handle.  Once the JBW has hardened tape the blade full length with masking tape so that you can clamp the knife by the blade end into your vice. Saw off the rivet heads with the hacksaw. They should be sticking up enough that you can get at them with the saw blade.  Think about how you want the handle to be shaped. Look at some other knives and determine in your head how the handle should look. Begin with a 12"" - 18"" length of 80 grit and begin removing handle material like you are a shoe shine guy at the airport shining a rich guy's shoe. There is no real need to dance and sing and pop the sandpaper while you do this but you can if you feel the need. Up to you. That 80 grit will remove material pretty quick so leave material for the following grits to get at. The 400 grit makes a fairly nice finish for a working knife but go with a finer grit if that's what you want. Apply either mineral oil or olive oil or (my favorite)  http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-spoon-butter-or-cutting-board-cream-out-of-beeswax-and-sunflower-oil-projects-from-the-kitchn-214882  Ok! Ok! Ok! I know! I have left you with a pretty knife that is as dull as a hammer! So we aren't finished you. It is a thing of beauty but it won't cut so we have some material to remove and it is HARDENED tool steel. I am (unfortunately) an engineer so I am all about accuracy and I honestly believe that a knife should have an ACCURATE secondary or cutting bevel. A good, all around bevel is 20 degrees. A 20 degree bevel will cut rope and slice tomatoes and cut cardboard. Only in the extreme (very thin bread knives, big choppers and axes) blade shapes should you fool with cutting bevels other than 20 degrees. But it needs to be accurate AND the primary bevel needs to extend the full depth of the blade. So I need to send you to a sporting goods place to purchase this:  http://www.amazon.com/Lansky-Deluxe-5-Stone-Sharpening-System/dp/B000B8IEA4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1429984607&sr=8-1&keywords=lansky+sharpening+kit  Thirty bucks might be somewhat dear but it does have the virtue of being accurate AND it actually works AND you can use it on all your other knives.  So set up the Lansky with your new knife (tape the blade under the clamp so you won't mar your new finish. Fussy? Hey, it's your handmade knife and you want to show it to your momma and your wife!)  This ""sharpening"" process will take some time, practice and patience. Figger on at least and hour.  And I believe that about does it for me. Just remember that I warned you - making knives is as addictive and as habit forming as golf, motorcycles, sporting clays, cigars, Scotch and bar B quing!  Let me know if I can answer questions. And, BTW, I do have and use a Beaumont KMG."

Bladesmith,33s2lh,Whiskey_Beard,3,Sun Apr 26 02:28:24 2015 UTC,I think what you want is a belt grinder and a bench grinder with a buffing wheel.  In the U.S. the 2x42 Craftsman is hands down the hobbyist knife maker's belt grinder.  But Sears doesn't sell it in Canada.  If you can sneak across the border to a Sears that may be worth the drive.  Otherwise you're left with a 1x30.  I got rid of my 1x30 as soon as I found a used 2x42.  It would have been more cost effective to start with a new 2x42 rather than buying a bunch of 1x30 belts and then starting over.  Are you sure you need to do buffing?  Not everybody does.
Bladesmith,33s2lh,gnique,1 point,Sat Apr 25 03:25:45 2015 UTC,"This. I bought a 1x30 Grizzly from amazon with the 5 inch disc on the side. I am already thinking about looking into a 2x42. So far for the ones I have made 3 knives in total I have gotten away with the 1x30 belt sander, a bench grinder and a cheap home made coal forge for around 30 bucks. Not the most professional but I like the ones I have made so far and have gotten a lot of compliments from friends and family. Also, I hand sand the blade as I do not have any type of buffing wheels."

Bladesmith,33mrjn,mattthescreamer,9,Thu Apr 23 20:01:18 2015 UTC,"Titanium has some very quirky working properties. Im not too sure you can forge it. Also, depending on the alloy, it may not hold an edge well.   You'll have to research this particular alloy to find out!"
Bladesmith,33mrjn,Frequent-Flyer,5,Thu Apr 23 20:52:45 2015 UTC,"It is a bitch to grind, forget about forging. Most grades are ~36 rc, grade 5 might be able to get into the low 40s if you can find how to heat treat it.   All things considered though, carbodized Ti makes for a great dive knife."
Bladesmith,33mrjn,Dumbspirospero,6,Fri Apr 24 04:09:39 2015 UTC,"Like Frequent-Flyer said, titanium is odd. If you haven't worked with it before, I would recommend doing something else simple with it first (e.g. handle pins) and then return to this project. It's pretty screwy and annoying to work with. And I wish I could comment on the forging process, but I've never used titanium in any form other than pre-made billets or pins."
Bladesmith,33mrjn,stniesen,6,Fri Apr 24 00:36:32 2015 UTC,Titanium does not forge well. The temperature range for working it are very narrow and vary widely by alloy. It forms a thin layer of oxide very quickly that's hard to remove. It's better to machine it.
Bladesmith,33mrjn,recover921,4,Fri Apr 24 00:51:47 2015 UTC,So a good friend of mine is a physician and he gave me an old hip replacement.  I'm thinking about forging the spike into a blade and using the ball joint as the handle.  What do you guys think?  Can it be done?

Bladesmith,33mrjn,boxingnun,3,Thu Apr 23 20:25:30 2015 UTC,"Here is what the 27th edition of The Machinery's Handbook has to say about Titanium:   Titanium is a gray, light metal with a bette r strength-to-weight rati o than any other metal at room temperature, and is  used in corrosive environments or in applications that take advantage of its light weight, good strength,  and nonmagnetic properties. Titanium is available commercially in many  alloys, but multiple require ments can be met by a single grade of the commercially pure metal. The all oys of titanium are of three metallurgical types: alpha, alpha–beta, and beta, with thes e designations referrin g to the predominant phases present in the microstructure. Titanium has a strong affinity for hydr ogen, oxygen, and nitroge n gases, which tend to embrittle the material; carbon is another embrit tling agent. Titanium is outstanding in its resistance to strongly oxidi zing acids, aqueous chloride solu tions, moist chlorine gas, sodium hypochlorite, and seawater  and brine solutions. Near ly all nonaircraft applications take advantage of this corrosion resistance. Its  uses in aircraft engine compressors and in airframe structures are based on  both its high corrosion resi stance and high strength-to- weight ratio. Procedures for forming titanium are similar to  those for forming stainless steel. Titanium and its alloys can be machi ned and abrasive ground; how ever, sharp tools and continuous feed are required to prevent work hardening.  Tapping is difficult because the metal galls. Titanium castings can be produ ced by investment or graphi te mold methods; however, because of the highly reactive nature of the  metal in the presence of oxygen, casting must be done in a vacuum. Generally, titanium is wel ded by gas-tungsten arc or plas ma arc techniques, and the key to successful welding lies in proper cleani ng and shielding. The alpha–beta titanium alloys can be heat treated for higher st rength, but they are not easi ly welded. Beta and alpha–beta alloys are designed for formabi lity; they are formed in the  soft state, and then heat treated for high strength   I hope that helps."

Bladesmith,33mrjn,Karn3,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:18:27 2015 UTC,Here's a youtube video I saw a while ago that talks about forging titanium and has some useful information. As other people  have said though you should find out exactly alloy you've got before you try anything.
Bladesmith,33lzeo,Whiskey_Beard,4,Thu Apr 23 16:36:32 2015 UTC,"Nicely done! I really wasn't sure how that could have been saved. That area of decarb even adds a little character to the knife, as a reminder of its history."
Bladesmith,33lzeo,Fargraven,4,Thu Apr 23 17:01:15 2015 UTC,Thanks. I was not really sure how it was going to turn out either but I wanted to finish it regardless. I also agree that the little decarb spot adds character. Another lesson learned!
Bladesmith,33lzeo,Iokua_CDN,4,Thu Apr 23 17:10:16 2015 UTC,"In my humble opinion, the decarb makes it look better than a plain blade. I was about to comment some on the lines of ""That mark looks really good! Was that planned? How did you do it?"""

Bladesmith,33mifq,kliman,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:38:00 2015 UTC,"The thickness really depends on intended use. 5/16 is really wide, and if it is your first blade, harder to do in many ways.

Bladesmith,33kml1,Zalgroth,4,Thu Apr 23 07:49:18 2015 UTC,"the flame produced by a venturi burner that sized will be too large for a two brick forge.  the bricks you linked to are the incorrect type of brick for building a forge. you need to use the low density kind. its much thicker, light and more porous.  go talk to these people maybe? or here.  i dont know how close they are to you.  you could build a full sized forge from more bricks in order to fit the burner, or use a smaller burner with the 2 brick configuration"
Bladesmith,33kml1,thesirenlady,3,Thu Apr 23 09:13:07 2015 UTC,"What he said... and to add to it...  If you plan on building the Ron Reil burner, you may as well go ahead and build a functioning forge.  These burners are designed to evenly heat an interior volume of about 240 cu in (~3000 cubic cm). You also don't have to build a forge with bricks.  You can use kaowool or inswool(both are ceramic blankets) and a refractory cement(like satanite) to coat it."
Bladesmith,33kml1,shrikezulu,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:50:18 2015 UTC,"I think I'll do that once I've got a little bit more experience!

I have an old, empty propane tank that I could use for the body of the forge and I've seen some pretty cool designs out on the internet."
Bladesmith,33kml1,shrikezulu,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"It's what I use for my blacksmithing, more or less.  Although I use 2 sidearm burners and the volume of my forge is closer to 400 cu... But yes, lots of people use Reil burners for forging."
Bladesmith,33kml1,UncleJehmimah,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:44:52 2015 UTC,Thank you for your input! I didn't realize there were actually different types of fire bricks. What I may do is start with a small two-brick forge using a MAPP torch and upgrade to something better as time goes on. Thank you :)
Bladesmith,33kml1,thesirenlady,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:30:29 2015 UTC,"I've used the venturi burner with a two brick configuration and I haven't noticed any issues. What would be the drawbacks? Is it just a matter of ""you don't need something that big"", or is there more to it?"
Bladesmith,33kml1,UncleJehmimah,3,Thu Apr 23 23:48:47 2015 UTC,"obviously the setup is going to differ person to person but generally speaking the cavity on a two brick forge is small and the flame put out by a homemade venturi burner is large.  The idea with a forge is that you want indirect heat, the refracted heat thats bouncing off the brick or wool, because the temperature is more consistent and the atmosphere is easier to control"
Bladesmith,33kml1,FlyingSteel,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:23:45 2015 UTC,"I suppose my forge isn't really two bricks, it's four, It's got two porous fire bricks on the sides (where the burner comes through), and hard fire brick on the top (bought it initially, then realized it wasn't recommended). The porous bricks reflect heat from the flame coming in from the left side, evening out the heat in the forge. I'll admit it's not optimal to achieve an even heat treat, but it allows me to get steel very hot very quickly. Now that you've pointed it out, my main worry is the creation of hot spots.  My forge is about 81 cubic inches (3 x 3 x 9). That's approximately 1/3rd the size of the cavity the burner is designed for. Then again, it's open on both ends. The flame splits and jets out both sides, it seems to spread fairly evenly in the cavity. If I run at a lower PSI, thus pushing less gas into the combustion chamber, it seems to be fine. Of course, a real two brick is gonna have approximately 1/8th or even less volume than the Ron Reil burner wants.  You've given me some stuff to think about. Sorry for the ramble."

Basically the same process as everyone I guess? and I eyeballed the thickness of my handle, and made sure my pins won't come through the wood when attaching it to the knifeblank"

My suggestion would be similar to that of fluffy-d-wolf only instead of thin super glue I would go with a clear or white wood glue.  Mix it in a container with fine dust from the same type of wood until desired color is reached, pack into cracks, let it cure, then sand it.  That should work."
Bladesmith,337clv,fluffy-d-wolf,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:25:42 2015 UTC,"Wow, yeah. You're not going to be able to fully hide that. The cracks I fix using the method I described are much narrower than that.  I think boxingnun has the right idea."

Bladesmith,337clv,iolithblue,2,Fri Apr 24 14:40:57 2015 UTC,"There are several things you can do, depending on your end goal.   If you want to totally hide them, then take a small file, dremel, or whatever you have, and make some dust from your scale. I like to grind the edge closest to whatever side will get cut off, or grind up a scrap piece.   Collect this dust in a dixie cup. Use a small piece of wood, tongue depressor, or whatever, to pack that dust into the cracks. Pack it as tight as you can get it. Use ""super thin"" super glue over the crack. Don't spare the super glue, either. Soak that thing!  You will get some smoking from the crack, DO NOT BREATHE IT! Also don't let it get to your eyes! Do this in a very well ventilated area, better yet, turn a fan on blowing toward you. The fumes from this process are extremely noxious. I don't know the details of why this happens, I just know it's very bad.  When you sand it down, the cracks should be damn near invisible. You will see them, but show it to a friend and they will probably never spot the crack.  If you want to highlight the cracks like the Japanese do, use the same process, just use a contrasting material instead of your cocobolo scraps."
Bladesmith,337clv,iolithblue,2,Mon Apr 20 14:44:01 2015 UTC,If you want the cracks and voids visible the clear epoxy suggestions seem like a good bet. One thing I've been interested in is mixing some glow powder in with the epoxy before setting it in. I've seen tables done like this and thought it looked awesome.
Bladesmith,337clv,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:09:22 2015 UTC,"Some suggestions  Try on scrap.  Epoxy mixed with artists oil paint will give fun colours. Use a syringe to get into the cracks. Super glue. Will required multiple layers/applications. Drown the whole piece in epoxy under vacuum. Use this to pull the epoxy deep into the cracks. Cure on a sheet of wax paper, cut and sand to size. Cactus juice from turntex. Not sure of its crack bridging ability,"

Bladesmith,32v76q,thesirenlady,3,Fri Apr 17 02:34:39 2015 UTC,grain refinement is the main purpose of normalization.  it should definitely be done on a forged blade
Bladesmith,32skhd,CausalError,8,Thu Apr 16 11:14:03 2015 UTC,"Silver and Palladium won't alloy with steel (though they can mix with each other, silver and Palladium) so it would have to be an inlay on the blade.  Also any acid commonly use to etch steel will not react well with Palladium.  Not saying it couldn't be done, only that the smith making it has more than a little work cut out for them.  Besides, those metals for those reasons don't line up with the lore.  Pro-tip: almost everything dies when its head is removed, no reason to get fancy about it. ;)"

Bladesmith,32skhd,Sorrowless,10,Sat Apr 18 20:47:18 2015 UTC,"Iron and palladium have similar melting points, so I assume if you were to make some crucible steel, and add in some palladium while heating, it wouldn't lose too much strength. As for silver, it melts at a much lower point.. so if I were to make this blade there are a few ways.  Outright forging the bastard, pallidium and steel billet. Get some refined bars, and make a damascus blade, it would be pretty damn flashy if etched properly.  Making a crucible steel billet, with Pallidium, the alloy is super strong, obviously added to the initial bits.  And mix with your borax, or flux materials, powdered silver when drawing out the billet. Hammer in some of that silver, try to get it in the blade.  And in any case I would do an inlay of silver. It would be super flashy, and expensive, and it fits the fantasy feel.  Alternatively the owner could buy a sword made of the alloy, and just clean the sword regularly with a mix of virgins blood, holy water, and some form of aqueous silver solution.  Tl;dr Yes, it is plausible. But I wouldn't want to be the smith to make it."

I definitely would go the Damascus route, palladium steel alloy blade, mix in some nickle heavy steels to give it a real interesting look.  Quench it in the blood like it was my favorite thing. Polish her up a little, add some inlay of silver, do some more polishing. Then etch, using some form of acid, the pattern in.  Add some silver scrollwork in the handle, and let the priest do their work.  All in all. Fun build, beautiful blade, works as a sword, and a monster hunters best friend."
Bladesmith,32skhd,Sorrowless,-2,Thu Apr 16 12:18:34 2015 UTC,"You're high off your ass. Palladium would not strong. At all. It would not work... Palladium is a soft, incredibly expensive metal."
Bladesmith,32skhd,Benman415,3,Fri Apr 17 00:04:53 2015 UTC,"The metals would alloy, I am in no way saying a 50/50 mix of metals. That would actually be ridiculous.  Palladium steel has some very interesting properties. One of which, if crafted properly, is incredible flexibility, allowing it to return to it's original shape. This is incredibly useful, and if per say, as I mentioned above, if it were Damascus steel, only one every 20-30 layers would have some palladium in the steel.  Would the sword have palladium? Yes. Would it be crafted entirely out of it? No.  Also, this was a question for a fantasy sword. If you haven't noticed, I'm new to this sub. I've crafted blades, but not since my childhood.  Can you make the blade? Yes. Will it be the best blade to use? Heavens no. But it will at least be what was asked for.  And as for the chemistry degree I have, while we're making assumptions, I guess that's is useless as well."

Bladesmith,32skhd,CokeCanNinja,3,Fri Apr 17 22:28:30 2015 UTC,If it were a bronze sword silver could be alloyed into it at low quantities without losing too much strength and giving a bit more corrosion resistance. The sword could be made in the shape of a cross to help with the demon issue. Palladium would kinda screw everything up and getting iron involved would be a giant chemical and structural nightmare.

Bladesmith,32l6m9,22theTBox,9,Tue Apr 14 17:55:24 2015 UTC,"Forget the idea of mixing two materials materials to combine properties.  Great idea for a 12th century samurai blacksmith.  great idea for a bandsaw blade.  so so idea for a knife. the benefit gained from the effort put in is negligible.  Furthermore, the steels chosen to go into a damascus mix are often there because they share similar characteristics. The most common mix in carbon damascus is 1075 and 15n20, because they have a more or less identical composition with 15n20 having added nickel.  The biggest problem with your suggested mix is hardening. s90v hardens at 2150F, S7 hardens at 1750F. so one element is going to suffer.  Tom mayo offers a high performance damascus composed of CTS-XHP and 154CM, both which harden at 1950F"
Bladesmith,32l6m9,thesirenlady,2,Tue Apr 14 22:50:08 2015 UTC,"I havn't found anything to suggest damascus having any real performance advantages, especially the kind you're talking about. What makes you think you will get the best of both instead of the other way round, as in the S90V sections on the edge will still be chippy and hard to sharpen while the S7 will rust just as readily. Don't forget forging these steels is less than ideal, as is the compromise on the usually very specific heat treats.  Damasteel make fairly fancy damascus, it's RWL-34 and a PM version of 12C27 if I'm not mistaken. It's $750 a meter though!"

Bladesmith,32d7d0,A-Grey-World,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:55:05 2015 UTC,You can. I made many bevels by hand. This was made by hand with files http://imgur.com/a/2vSQy . Given I practiced for a long time and jigs make everything easier. Trust me and get some 1084 and some files. Build the jig and file out a few knives.

Bladesmith,32d7d0,InquisitiveLion,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:20:56 2015 UTC,"color/even-ness of heat throughout the steel. You know when you're supposed to pull and quench it. Took me a few tries to get proper results. Works with 1084 and 1095 pretty well. Got low-60s RC and tempered down to about 57-59. The kitchen knives I would temper down to 60 even, and just tell my customers to not be fucking idiots and try to cut chicken bones with a paring knife."
Bladesmith,32d7d0,xGODSTOMPERx,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:43:27 2015 UTC,"You do it by color? I only do even heating by color, but I make sure to test with a magnet to know when I'm close, I don't trust the color. Too many variables with me and I don't do it often enough right now.  I've successfully treated my 1080 and I'm moving up to 1095, same process for both? Anything different that I need to look out for?"
Bladesmith,32d7d0,InquisitiveLion,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:10:47 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't actively test for magnetism these days mostly because I've done it a bunch. Before I used one of those long handled nailgrabber magnets from Harbor Freight (always good to buy shit and test functionality there because it's dirt cheap and you're out next to nothing if it fails.)  You get an eye for it. Next step is making sure your shit doesn't warp when you quench it. I made an adjustable jig for my quench bucket that allows SOME flex while cooling, but not enough to set in a crescent. I usually have to beat some curve out after temper, but whatever.  Two plates with adjustment screws to account for blade thickness. Eyeball it. It'll work out."
Bladesmith,32d7d0,xGODSTOMPERx,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:25:36 2015 UTC,"I have some craftsman nail grabbers from my father, and they've held up pretty well so far for that task.   How often do you get warping? I've done a grand total of 2 so far and they come out straight as an arrow...."
Bladesmith,32d7d0,InquisitiveLion,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:28:36 2015 UTC,"Depends on the grind. I used to grind my whole bevel, then HT. I had a lot more because I would, out of inexperience, grind a little more or less on either side, and that would cause warping. Now that I only grind the major bulk, leaving a square edge at the bottom instead of a dull V grind, I have much less warping. Still, longer thinner knives will always pose a problem in that realm. Especially using recycled materials. I use some band saw blade to cut kitchen knives out of, and they'll always take a curve in the quench. I refer back to original piece and check it's curve, then beat my blade the opposite curve, and it will usually warp itself into being straight."
Bladesmith,32d7d0,thesirenlady,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:55:10 2015 UTC,"ah, I see... I always just use virgin materials. How do you test your hardness?"
Bladesmith,32d7d0,A-Grey-World,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:19:15 2015 UTC,"Dont be overwhelmed by amount of steel choices and dont be overly concerned about what you end up going with.  Pick 1 carbon, 1 stainless and maybe an inbetween. stick with em and get good at em.  1084 is timeless and proven. I see absolutely no reason to stock more than 1 10xx series steel.  CPM154 performs more than adequately. is moderately priced, if not cheap due to all the super fancy stuff of late. gives you multitudes of finish options and none of them are difficult.  and D2 is again affordable and proven  all of those are available from knifemaker.ca but im not sure how those prices will compare to someone like the aforementioned aldo or alpha knife supply."

Bladesmith,32d7d0,obeythehypnotoad,2,Mon Apr 13 01:00:26 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend 1084. It's by far the easiest to heat treat as you don't need to soak it at critical temperatures or ramp slowly.  Basically, you can heat it in a simple blow-torch 2 brick forge or charcoal-hairdryer setup."
Bladesmith,32d7d0,InquisitiveLion,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:03:52 2015 UTC,What about HT for 1095? Does that take something special?

I don't know much about heat treating with a forge, but if you don't have a PID controller regulating your forge then yes, an oven will provide consistent results especially on larger blades. Plus it opens up the steel options quite a bit.    Can you do it safely with a temp controller possibly?   Yeah, PID controller with thermocouple.    If you have plans, I would be VERY interested.

Bladesmith,32d7d0,thesirenlady,0,Sun Apr 19 00:48:59 2015 UTC,"I believe it's very similar, being a simple carbon steel like 1084"

Bladesmith,32d7d0,thesirenlady,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:18:14 2015 UTC,"It is different. 1084 is deep hardening. 1095 is shallow hardening.  shallow hardening is what allows for the ultra active hamon lines, but it requires a faster quench, both in rates of cooling and time between pulling from the forge and the actual quench, which is what gives it the reputation of being difficult.  the extra carbon found in 1095 will allow it to reach a higher hardness than 1084 but we're talking like 65 instead of 63, both of which are arguably impractical on a knife.  I said before that "" I see absolutely no reason to stock more than 1 10xx series steel"", it should sort of read that theres not a lot of reasons to use 1095 over 1084 because unless you're trying to make a very active hamon line, they are as good as identical in terms of a finished knife, but different beasts for the knifemaker."
Bladesmith,32d7d0,InquisitiveLion,1 point,Thu Apr 16 02:38:02 2015 UTC,"uh-oh, which would you suggest to stick to in the future? I have about equal quantities of each. Someone suggested that I use the 1095 for smaller projects (the majority of my future work) and keep the 1084 in my back pocket for bigger projects, which seems to align slightly with your quicker quenching problems.  Also, what should I be quenching in? I used straight canola oil earlier, but I'm wondering if that's normal or suggested over something like motor oils or something like that."

Bladesmith,329ijc,boxingnun,2,Sun Apr 12 14:06:23 2015 UTC,yea
Bladesmith,329ijc,A-Grey-World,2,Sun Apr 12 18:56:40 2015 UTC,"You should have a mm or so thickness before heat treat. After you want to grind this down to something like half a mm before sharpening to an edge, but then this all depends on your blades' use and preferences. There's a big discussion here:  http://knifedogs.com/archive/index.php/t-27925.html"
Bladesmith,329ijc,thezep,2,Mon Apr 13 14:11:59 2015 UTC,"I struggled with this for a while. There are a couple things you can do. A file is one option, but it will take a while, try to use a medium or fine  single cut. You can also use your grinder, but you will need to have a light touch and preferably some kind of speed control. If you don't have speed control the 220grit 3M ""gator"" belts are the bees knees, they're smooth and keep things really cool. After getting a nice 400 grit edge on the grinder I move to water stones. If you're going to do a fair amount of knife making a good set of full size bench stones (arkansas, waterstone, oil stones, take your pick) are invaluable. Anyways, my two cents."
Bladesmith,329ijc,thezep,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:20:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. Being 17, i don't have a grinder(yet) so i would be using files and then a lansky system. so would i just work it down till i think its half way and then switch?

Bladesmith,327du2,JRTjack801,3,Sat Apr 11 05:37:19 2015 UTC,A couple questions: what's a San Mai? What process did you use to combine the jacket with the core? Standard get it hot enough and smash them together or?

Bladesmith,328z1w,Zalgroth,1 point,Sat Apr 11 17:37:40 2015 UTC,"Unfortunaltely that is most likely mild steel, which can not be heat treated. Carbon content is a factor, but every treatable steel has different specs for temp, soak time, quench medium, etc. If you're steel isn't labeled as any certain type, it's probably plain mild steel. BUT, don't hesitated to practice on mild steel, it's great to learn bevels and other techniques."
Bladesmith,328z1w,suckerforhentai,1 point,Sat Apr 11 18:02:34 2015 UTC,You can't get mild steel to harden. I'd suggest put that blade away and keep as a first attempt at a knife-shaped object. Read up and buy a proper knife steel that you either can heat treat yourself or send out.
Bladesmith,328z1w,RDalman,1 point,Sat Apr 11 18:07:33 2015 UTC,"As others have said, low carbon/mild steels cannot be heat treated and wouldn't be ideal for a blade.   You can do a spark test to get a rough idea, but they're still pretty ambiguous in my opinion. I don't like them, personally.  But if it's anything like the steel I've gotten from Lowe's/Home Depot, it's probably just mild steel. I use it for plain blacksmithing projects that don't necessarily require ""good"" steel."
Bladesmith,328z1w,Fargraven,0,Sat Apr 11 19:21:38 2015 UTC,There's a chance it has enough carbon to harden.  You could try an ice cold brine quench and see if that works.

Robb Gunter reported consistent results of HRC 42-45, testing 1018 steel in ""SuperQuench"" at Sandia National Labs.

You can buy a controller off the shelf, you will want a ramp and soak PID which accepts a type K thermocouple. You also need an SSR (solid state relay) which will take the current you want to run as well as a matching heat sink.   Finally, you buy some pre-made or make your own heating coils out of a resistance heating wire such as Kanthal or Nichrome. You choose the total resistance of the system so that you reach the desired power level. Typically you have a fixed voltage and use the resistance of the wire to control the current.   There are good plans online for making element holders, as well as great resources from the companies selling the controllers with regards to set-up of the wiring.

Bladesmith,325aii,Suepahfly,1 point,Sat Apr 11 14:38:20 2015 UTC,I indeed got it from them. I had no problems concerning flatness. Maybe my standards are not as high since this was my first blade.
Bladesmith,325aii,RIKENAID,2,Sat Apr 11 16:35:56 2015 UTC,There are others that sell  O2 for 13 euro (40 x 4 x 5000mm) but you generally pay a lot in shipping since they're steel companies that deal business to business and not primarily to consumer.  The European name for O2 is 1.2842 and O1 is called 1.2510. You find more suppliers searching those numbers.  It's a great looking blade btw. especially since it's your first one.

Bladesmith,322e9z,powertyisfromgun,2,Fri Apr 10 15:20:30 2015 UTC,"It is carbon steel and heat treats very well and very easily with inexpensive equipment.  In the beginning and during forging it is too soft to be useful, but the heat treating process makes it hard and will let it hold an edge.  However stuff like this post bothers me.  When leaf springs are used they form stress fractures in the steel causing them to be brittle over time.  This is why OP said it broke in the first place.  These stress fractures cannot be easily or reliably forged out.  So OP just made a knife that is full of potential failure points.  Now that being said his knife looks cool and is better than any knife i've ever forged."
Bladesmith,322e9z,Pepsisinabox,2,Fri Apr 10 15:54:30 2015 UTC,"So it's more for the process of forging it yourself, than the actual utility of the blade itself? I can get behind that."

So the choice is not only for ease and affordability, when done right the steels make some good knives too.  But basically Yeah.  and I agree with you."

Bladesmith,322e9z,powertyisfromgun,0,Fri Apr 10 16:52:54 2015 UTC,If you did it right.  I feel like that would be difficult.  You can buy unused 1095 very cheaply.  I used to back when i ventured into knofe making.  Ka-bar uses virgin 1095 along with many other knife companies.  I just dont reccomend  scavenging from old ford pickups
Bladesmith,322e9z,JRTjack801,3,Fri Apr 10 17:20:36 2015 UTC,Well damn. I would have forged it out of 1095 or 5160 bar stock but I got a tip from someone either here or r/blacksmith to use leaf spring. Now I feel as if my work is crap.
Bladesmith,322e9z,powertyisfromgun,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:56:36 2015 UTC,"Your work is not crap necessarily, there are a lot of factors that go into something like a leaf spring. It depends on how old it was, what kind of steel (if it is really old, my guess would be 5160). If you normalized and heat treated properly etc. it looks like a nice balde to me and you should be proud of that. If I were you I would put it to the test to determine for myself rather it meets your standards, that's what it's all about in the end, right? Best of luck."

Bladesmith,320llp,kliman,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:19:07 2015 UTC,Heating up the steel and actually bashing on it isn't outside the realm of possibility...I've just wondered if that's how it's done if you aren't actually forging the thing out of a bar.
Bladesmith,320llp,icecoldcelt,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:32:51 2015 UTC,"If you're not forging it to final shape, you can still just ""texture"" the piece then finish with stock removal, but that's cheap and pointless. It's really easy to notice if you've ever done any forging, though."

Bladesmith,320llp,Benman415,2,Thu Apr 9 22:06:24 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be: scramasax or seax just refers to the type of knife, like Bowie or bollock or baselard. That being said the blade shape doesn't seem to fit terribly well into any of the scramasax/seax typologies I've seen, but that could very possibly be a camera trick because all of the pictures are at some sort of angle."
Bladesmith,320llp,BrennaAtOsku,2,Fri Apr 10 00:49:03 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. For me, scramascus/ scramasax has always meant a form of steel made of scrap, to make damascus. Its bits and cut offs of the same steel, stuffed in a tube and forged solid. My bad."

'cherry handle', not so much"
Bladesmith,321rfa,thesirenlady,2,Fri Apr 10 01:28:45 2015 UTC,"You don't need an extremely dense wood like ironwood (although it is amazing), but you don't want to do something like pine or balsa either. I would say that not any wood will suffice. You can use maple, oak or walnut fine (I think, I have actually only ever used stabilized wood.)   The density itself isn't what matters to me, but rather how resistant to breaking, denting, and scratching. Most composites used for knife scales, like micarta, are pretty light, but work great."
Bladesmith,321rfa,sandmansleepy,2,Thu Apr 9 22:07:53 2015 UTC,"It depends on the knife. If you want it to be balanced (maybe a throwing knife) or if you want a heavy blade (chopping).  Like Sandmansleepy said, the other properties are equally important, if not more. You should never make a decision on a type of wood strictly based on one property.   Edit: meant to make this as a new comment instead of a reply."
Bladesmith,321rfa,Fargraven,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:34:46 2015 UTC,"Im linking to a full write up i did on woods that work well for handles. But to answer the question, density has a few benifits. First is that its a pretty good indicator of hardness. The two are pretty well correlated, and a hard handle is good. Second is the weight makes it easier to balance the knife out, and the last part is that it feel more solid. There is no simple way to say it, and while many makers make amazing pieces with maple or oak handles, for some reason an ironwood or coco handle has a special sort of sturdiness.

I'm looking into making kitchen knives next (rather than outdoor knives that I never use) and I might consider that shape for one. Just a couple questions;  Can I use 1080 steel for a kitchen knife? Only because I have plenty of it on hand.  Also, can I use what I normally use for handles? Or should it be stabilized?"
Bladesmith,31xe6k,new-Baltimoreon,3,Wed Apr 8 23:41:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  The most commonly used carbon cutlery steels seem to be O1 and 52100, with hitachi white and blue on the higher end stuff.  I don't recall seeing anyone using 1080 off the top of my head, but if you have it laying around I don't know of any compelling reason not to use it.  There may be one, I'm just not aware of any.  I'm a stainless guy mostly so that's a bit outside my area.  I would certainly recommend using stabilized wood, cocobolo, ironwood, or synthetic scales.  More absorbent woods will eventually crack with enough wet/dry cycles.  Of course you can seal or finish just about anything, but in my opinion, finishing a handle is inferior to using something that needs no finish."

Bladesmith,3209c1,yangxiaodong,3,Thu Apr 9 15:24:30 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by 'chipped'? I am imagining chunks flying off. What steel are you using? That shouldn't happen.   40 grit will leave lots of marks and it wont be amazingly smooth; if that is what you are talking about, that can be sanded off by hand with higher grits. If you are talking about gouges caused by the sanding, and the belt is in good condition, you might be hitting the sander at an angle, gouging it with the edges of the belt.  It is hard to say what went wrong without knowing what it looks like. Upload a picture maybe?"
Bladesmith,3209c1,sandmansleepy,2,Thu Apr 9 15:45:24 2015 UTC,"chipped, the blade is chipped. Like it got batoned into a chunk of steel or something. I think i'm sanding it at a bad angle, (2 inch thing of steel at a really sharp angle) which could be making it too thin."
Bladesmith,3209c1,A-Grey-World,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:21:58 2015 UTC,Is it only in one place? Could be a flaw in the steel
Bladesmith,3209c1,doublehelix1,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:27:00 2015 UTC,one piece. can it snap it i press it hard onto the belt?
Bladesmith,3209c1,sandmansleepy,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:29:12 2015 UTC,"use a higher grit belt for bevels. Using a 40 grit will likely leave you  with a boat load of hard to get rid of scratches. ill cut bevels on thick steel (1/4"") usng  60/80 ceramic belt but then switch to 120 before the thickness of a quarter. before heat treat i work my blades up to a 400 grit finish and then leave the edge to be about 0.25mm  (or about 10thou). but that depends  on your heat treat method.  Also macro pictures help."
Bladesmith,3209c1,Benman415,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:46:51 2015 UTC,alright. Then what do i use a 40 grit for?
Bladesmith,3209c1,sandmansleepy,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:48:46 2015 UTC,40 grit is good for the shaping of the blank. It will remove material really fast.
Bladesmith,3209c1,Benman415,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:21:39 2015 UTC,"I would have to disagree. Most makers I know grind their bevels with a 36 grit, me included. the scratches arent that hard to get rid of at all. I go 36 to about 95%, then 60 grit, then 300A trizact, 100A, 65A, 45A, buff and it works perfectly."
Bladesmith,3209c1,doublehelix1,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:48:24 2015 UTC,"Cool. I don't have that much experience with grinders. All I know is that if there is chipping, something went wrong. What you said sounds correct, I have never had problems removing the scratches with higher grits."
Bladesmith,3209c1,Fargraven,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:13:20 2015 UTC,What I think was the issue was either improper softening or technique. Was this steel hardened?
Bladesmith,3209c1,thesirenlady,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:37:31 2015 UTC,At what step are you heat treating?
Bladesmith,3209c1,thesirenlady,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:15:55 2015 UTC,"My guess would be that the blade is too thin.   I've had something similar happen, but it was combined with the fact that I overheated the blade with a belt sander. But in your situation, with sand paper, that's very unlikely."
Bladesmith,3209c1,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:39:08 2015 UTC,"ah, alright. And it is a belt sander, i guess i forgot that part. It's a 1/8th by almost 2 inches and 3 inch long, so it's kinda a shitty design on my part."
Bladesmith,3209c1,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:37:46 2015 UTC,pictures please!  Were you doing an edge or a bevel? 40 grit is way too coarse for an edge. Should work fine for a bevel but based on your description you've passed zero edge thickness.
Bladesmith,32066n,B0neCru3her,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:00:52 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/q2iRZKe  Turned out great! Thanks! Flitz is amazing stuff.
Bladesmith,32066n,A-Grey-World,1 point,Sat Apr 11 11:59:07 2015 UTC,"You might have to start with a lower grit if it's a deep scratch. You could try 600 but if it's not doing much you will have to go lower or spend all day doing it.  Other than that, it's standard blade polishing. Clamp it down, use something like flat bar or a file wrapped in the paper and go up the grits. Making sure you get all of the previous sanding marks off before you go to the next. Be careful of the cutting edge.   To polish to a shine stop at 1800 or 2000 and use any buffing compound and a drill with a cotton wheel. Never used flitz, but looks the same as ""Autosol"" that I use.   Be careful of going too near the handle, as it might be difficult to finish this area without damaging the wood. It can always be taken apart, being a folder. I notice the pins are torx or Allen key, so they might just unscrew if it's not glued.   Certainly something you can do yourself if you have the patience.  Nice knife!"

Bladesmith,31xv7p,thesirenlady,3,Thu Apr 9 01:54:52 2015 UTC,The steel is cut with a shear.  That little cracking you see is the result of the shear blade pulling at the steel as it cuts though.  You just grind it away and don't use the that part. NBD.

Bladesmith,31wml2,PROMETHEUS-one,2,Wed Apr 8 19:00:34 2015 UTC,"post a pic of the knife? handle selection depends on the tang,  style of knife,  materials available and your preference.  I personally think that full tangs without bolsters are the easiest ( scales pinned and glued to the knife post heat treat, bolster area needs to be pretty well shaped before gluing but then the rest of the handle can be shaped after the glue dries).  Handle wraps aren't that hard either but the knife needs to be a full width/length tang (ie no stick tangs)  just my opinion,  we've all been where you are. Don't  be  discouraged if you fit everything up and dont like the look. My first full length hidden tang (dirk with brass bolster and pomel) took me a couple tries before i was happy."

Bladesmith,31q7m8,galeforpres,5,Tue Apr 7 08:26:54 2015 UTC,"316 and 304 won't take a good heat treat. You do not temper metal in order to make it soft enough to cut, you anneal it.  If you want to work with stainless steel, you should buy the proper alloy and do it right. That being said, the heat treating process for stainless is different enough to be tricky for a beginner.  Do yourself a favor and make a couple more knives out of H/C steel, do a bunch of research, and THEN tackle stainless steel."
Bladesmith,31q7m8,WingedDefeat,5,Tue Apr 7 10:32:10 2015 UTC,"I would suggest this, but if you actually want stainless, buy some 440c from newjerseysteelbaron and get it professionally heat treated when you are done."

The easiest stainless to work with is AEB-L, and it also happens to be the cheapest.  Many of the stainless steels take a lot of time and effort to grind and finish.

I use type K thermocouples in them because they need to measure up to around 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. For heat treating you could use a type J. They both cost about the same amount. A type K might give you more flexibility of use because it is rated for higher temperatures, but a type J may give you more accurate readings since it is more closely matched to your working range. The simplest way to use one as a thermometer is to connect one to a digital multimeter and keep a lookup chart handy."

Bladesmith,31kax1,gg249,3,Sun Apr 5 22:26:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the leaf spring steel (I've heard that some newer models may not use 5160, but I couldn't give you any specifics). One thing that could be generally said is that newer leaf springs will be better than old. That is, there is less chance for micro cracking that can cause the knife to break during heat treat (since these cracks are caused by stress on the spring).  A quick look at 5160 heat treatment says annealing should be done at 1450F followed by an air cool. If you don't have fine temperature control, most people use a magnet to test the steel. At a certain point (sometimes called the critical point) the steel will demagnetize. The annealing (and quenching) temperature is usually about 10F above this point. So you heat until a magnet won't stick to it and then keep heating for a short time to make sure that the piece is heated throughout to the correct temp. The site I found says air cooling for annealing, but using ashes shouldn't hurt if you want to be certain.  After it's softened and you cut out the shape, hammer in bevels, and then do the final shaping you'll want to spend a lot of time sanding. If you want a smooth, polished blade then be prepared to do a whole lot of sanding. Move up through the grits until at least 400 before heat treat (to prevent scratches on the surface causing cracking during quench).  Heat treating will be done at the same temperature as annealing. 5160 should be quenched in oil that's about 100-150F. A lot of people use natural oils such as peanut or olive oil. I've used used motor oil but it's not recommended due to health hazards and flammability. Once you've gotten your oil preheated and your blade up to non-magnetic plus a few moments, quench straight into the oil. Congratulations, it's hardened.  Now you need to temper it. This will need to be more closely controlled temperature-wise. My source page says a range of 800-1300F for tempering 5160. The hotter you temper it the softer the end product will be. I've used a standard oven to temper before, but I was working with temperatures around the 350-450F mark. 800F might be harder to manage. Tempering should be done for one hour per inch of thickness (minimum one hour), preferably for two cycles. Temper for an hour, let it cool, then re-temper for an hour.  After it's been heat treated you will need to clean it up (more sanding) and do the final beveling. If you overheat the edge it will ruin the temper. If this happens the only way to get it back it to completely re-harden and re-temper. However, if you make sure to have water nearby to keep your blade cool during the grinding you should be fine. Some great advice I read was to not wear gloves during this portion. Keep the metal cool enough to touch comfortably with bare hands.  The standard method for putting the handle slabs onto the tang is to use brass pins and epoxy. The pins give it a little more strength for uses like chopping where the knife gets a sharp impact. Not necessary, maybe, but they look damn good.  I hope this helps some. I'm sure that I've missed something along the way, and I'll point out that I haven't worked with 5160 before. Hopefully someone that has can give their advice from experience."
Bladesmith,31kax1,BrokenCrw,1 point,Mon Apr 6 06:40:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks alot for the info! Why the quench in oil? Would water not work (or be optimal?)  I only have an oven to temper in, would 500F not be hot enough to do the trick? how could i get it to 800F reliably for an hour?   If I leave hammer marks on the sides of the blade, (rustic look), will that increase the chances of a crack when I quench it?  thanks for your time!"
Bladesmith,31kax1,BrokenCrw,2,Tue Apr 7 06:07:41 2015 UTC,"The quench is done in oil because it cools the metal more slowly than water. If you cool too quickly the internal stresses can crack the metal.  You can tempering without an oven by using tempering colors (google it for more info). It's not nearly as accurate, takes skill or lick, and would almost guarentee that the blade is not evenly tempered. But the basic idea is thi: after the quench clean the blade and sand until you have bare metal. Then reheat slowly until you get the color you want. A golden-straw is the hardest temper.  Hammer marks may increase the chance of cracking, though I don't know by how much. One thing I forgot to mention is normalizing. When you hammer the steel it causes stresses to build up. Normalizing is done before quenching to get rid of these stresses. To normalize you heat to nonmagnetic and then let air cool to room temp. I usually do this three times and then quench.  Edit: 500F would nit be hot enough for tempering. Each alloy has a threshold where the structure will begin to change."
Bladesmith,31hj52,yangxiaodong,9,Sun Apr 5 03:22:41 2015 UTC,"Well it does look beautiful when you can combine steels with different properties and then etch them to expose the layers.  There is also methods like San mai, which allow you to sandwich one steel between another. This way you can have a protective stainless steel layer with a higher carbon layer in the middle. Or any combination that works really. Also it looks badass, just Google 'san mai'  So yes there are still some applications to folding steel, especially if you're combining different varieties. Nonetheless, it is always good practice to learn how to forge weld properly too."
Bladesmith,31hj52,IAmAPhysicsGuy,13,Sun Apr 5 04:09:13 2015 UTC,"There is no reason to fold steel for a knife anymore.  The folding steel thing was to make a homogeneous piece of steel; that's all.  Modern steel is amazingly homogeneous, so folding is not necessary.  The idea that ""folding steel"" somehow makes it better is a bunch of crap.  That only works when your steel is non-uniform in composition like tamahagane."
Bladesmith,31hj52,shrikezulu,2,Sun Apr 5 03:36:00 2015 UTC,oh. alright then.
Bladesmith,31hj52,shrikezulu,7,Sun Apr 5 04:02:57 2015 UTC,"I should have made that distinction.  Aesthetically is really the only reason to fold anything anymore.  Pattern welded blades are sweet looking, but as far as performance...  well it doesn't do anything.   As /u/IAmAPhysicsGuy mentions, there are practical applications for forge welding.  You can make san mai blades with stainless jackets as he mentions and you can also weld high carbon edges to a low carbon spine and make a blade both tough and that will hold a wicked edge.  But there is really no folding involved in this."
Bladesmith,31hj52,hoopladude,0,Sun Apr 5 06:01:24 2015 UTC,"Look into competition cutters if you're interested in what makes really good qualities for knives and what steals they use.

Bladesmith,31hj52,RIKENAID,3,Sun Apr 5 04:34:31 2015 UTC,"Well not even that. It's not better to use folded or ""Damascus"" it's just that Japanese have a tradition and competition. The best steels are the steels we can make with modern technology that can be easily reformulated for your specific needs. One thing to note is how well you will be able to hear treat the steel you choose. For instance, there are a lot of amazing tool steels but they require very specific temps to be their best. A field knife and a city knife are also going to have various ideal qualities such as corrosion resistance and edge retention. Yeah but seriously, no point in folded steel anymore with the amazing cpm's and alike."

That heat treating oven is very accurate, but isnt cheap.  A homemade one is cheaper than a pre-built but regardless, its at least a few hundred bucks. You need the bricks, the heating element, a PID, a thermocouple, the wiring, blah blah blah.  Not cheap. I use my forge to heat treat along with a thermocouple.  Trust me when I say that this hobby is a money sink.  It can be as expensive as you want it to be."
Bladesmith,31h22b,shrikezulu,1 point,Sun Apr 5 05:54:37 2015 UTC,"Alright. By not very accurate, what do you mean? Are there was to make it more accurate? And will a normal butane or propane torch work?"
Bladesmith,31h22b,shrikezulu,2,Sun Apr 5 15:18:35 2015 UTC,"Accurate as in evenly heating the blade and temperature control.    Most people that use the two brick forge method are using a magnet to tell when they are at critical temp.  While this works, it is a fudge.  It is easy to shoot past the critical temp and wind up with large grain, which is bad.  You can use a thermocouple to monitor your temperature, and that is what I do.  I use a type-K thermocouple and it takes the guesswork out of my temps.    Yes, propane will work.  I have a Benzomatic TS8000 hand torch  running MAPP gas or Propane for starting my forge, or and small heating I need to do."
Bladesmith,31h22b,kingswee,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:30:34 2015 UTC,large grain? and what happens if i overshoot the temp and i know i did? do i just let it air cool until it's good?
Bladesmith,31h22b,anviltodrum,0,Sun Apr 5 17:49:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, steal has grain; it is crystalline in nature.  If you want to get serious about it, go to the wiki page and read about it.  There is a pretty gnarly animation on the page of grains growing. But, for our purposes here, just know that heat causes the grain of the steel to grow.  The larger the grain, the weaker the steel.    Overshooting the desired temp for heat treating by a little bit is not a big deal.  But when it becomes a hundred degrees or more, then you will have issues.  Letting the blade air cool will help as long as the temps are right.  Part of the heat treating process is called normalization.  This is done in cycles.  Keep in mind that the heat treatment temps are different for different steels, but the process itself stays the same.  The following is for 1080:   Heat blade to 1600 and let air cool. Heat blade to 1550 and let air cool. Heat blade to 1500 and let air cool. Heat blade to 1500 and quench in warm oil.   Without a thermocouple, you are relying on a magnet, and watching for decalenence in the steel to get your temps good."
Bladesmith,31fxwc,yangxiaodong,7,Sat Apr 4 18:38:12 2015 UTC,"Things to consider, other than balance, are that they have to be softer and a bit more springy, otherwise all the impacts will crack/chip/shatter them in no time. Also don't sharpen them like a razor, since your hands will be all over and around the blade as it leaves your grip.  Never made one, so take that with some salt"
Bladesmith,31fxwc,wic99,3,Sun Apr 5 02:34:02 2015 UTC,"Springy as in no heat treat, or anneal it more?"
Bladesmith,31fxwc,IAmAPhysicsGuy,5,Sun Apr 5 03:23:37 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. You'll anneal it to soften it. Shape it up, quench it, and then temper to a higher temp than you would for a knife, in the blue purple range. This is because you need to give up a little more hardness for springyness.  In my experience throwing, I like a knife with a little heft and balanced right in the middle. I also alternate occasionally between throwing by the blade and handle so that would be something to consider as well."
Bladesmith,31fxwc,squid_tree,4,Sun Apr 5 03:52:33 2015 UTC,"To add to everyone else who has posted so far, don't forget that material is easier to remove then to add. Finish the blade and then balance the handle/tang to the blade.  If you drill or cut too much out of the handle/tang you can add weight back with a cord wrap, or remove weight from the blade with a file. You can also add weight to the handle with a welder, don't do this to the blade, and run through the heat treat again. I would only do so as a last ditch effort, and I'm sure there many against the idea, but IMO it's a throwing knife, the first few shouldn't be pretty so long as they fly well."
Bladesmith,31fxwc,FlyingSteel,4,Sun Apr 5 06:18:43 2015 UTC,"I've made over 5,000.  Don't worry about balance.  The notion of a ""properly"" balanced throwing knife is a myth. Don't worry about steel grade.  You can make a good throwing knife from any steel in the 0.5% to 1.1% carbon range.  Do worry about:   Hardness.  Go to 54 RC max.  48 or 50 is a good value. Bevel grind.  You need to leave some meat in the tip, so a double-edge grind of 30° per side is good.  Use 20° per side for a single edged knife. Overall weight and length.  Shoot for a length of 9 to 16 inches, with a weight of 18 to 30 grams per linear inch."
Bladesmith,31fxwc,FlyingSteel,3,Sun Apr 5 16:19:52 2015 UTC,"alright. would this be a good thing for a ""beginner"" to do? it seems like something that's easy to mess up."

Bladesmith,31grl5,Msmith589,2,Sat Apr 4 22:55:37 2015 UTC,"Like others has said you can coat the spine with some clay to slow the quench in that area. Depending on the steel used the clay will form a hamon which shows the distinction line between the martensite edge and the softer pearlite back. Another easy way to do a differential heat treat is to do a full quench and then after tempering you can heat the spine of the blade with a torch while keeping the edge and tip in water to keep it from getting too hot. I use this method the most just because I find it a bit easier and more controlled. I have experienced some warping issues when using clay  Another way, which is a bit more complicated and tricky is using a torch to heat treat the blade by heating mostly the edge and staying away from the spine. This takes some skill to know the color you are trying to achieve before quench. I have seen some mastersmiths heat treat this way and are very comfortable doing so."

Bladesmith,30xpi1,aarongough,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:38:52 2015 UTC,Nice work! Looks like you've done a good job so far!
Bladesmith,30xpi1,aarongough,2,Tue Mar 31 18:48:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I used the filing jig I found on your youtube channel to do the bevels, I was amazed at how well it works."
Bladesmith,30xpi1,Aniquin,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:07:01 2015 UTC,Nice man! Glad it worked out for you!
Bladesmith,30xpi1,neutralchaos,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:05:11 2015 UTC,Looks very Spyderlike. I like it.

Bladesmith,30w7y6,chickeninthewoods,3,Tue Mar 31 05:08:35 2015 UTC,Its very... Simple. I like it. Good job!
Bladesmith,30w7y6,VaguelyHonest,2,Tue Mar 31 13:04:43 2015 UTC,"There is a beauty there in your design. I like. Cleans lines, simple and made to work. That is a great design for a knife built to be used."
Bladesmith,30w7y6,madeulook1,2,Tue Mar 31 18:53:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That was the goal. The file obviously limited the overall size. In retrospect, I'd shorten the blade in order to get another inch of handle and it would have been a proper paring knife. As it is, it's sort of a weird hybrid.. too long for a paring knife, too small for a chef's knife. It almost feels like a glorified steak knife."
Bladesmith,30w7y6,madwilliamflint,2,Tue Mar 31 19:54:55 2015 UTC,Nice.  Clean and effective.
Bladesmith,30ubo2,Joe_Edson,6,Mon Mar 30 19:49:38 2015 UTC,One of my first folders made (actually third one but made them all at the same time). Mokume bolsters and premium Koa scales. Hand rubbed W2 with slight hamon. Titanium liners are jewelled and anodized gold.
Bladesmith,30ubo2,FJ1906,2,Mon Mar 30 19:51:14 2015 UTC,Very nice! That koa and mokume go together very well. Sleek looking knife!

Bladesmith,30ubo2,perfunctificus,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:06:49 2015 UTC,Very nicely done.  I had been resisting the folder bug as well for a long time and have recently fallen victim.  I'd be curious to see more pics if you have them.
Bladesmith,30tb4n,poorfolkbows,6,Mon Mar 30 15:18:06 2015 UTC,Wow.Really great post!
Bladesmith,30tb4n,brutnus,3,Mon Mar 30 15:53:10 2015 UTC,Nice job. Those exact heat treating diagrams are more well explained by you. than they are in several metallurgy books I've seen. Thanks.
Bladesmith,30tb4n,Fargraven,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:43:23 2015 UTC,Thanks for taking the time to put this together. Really. I'm new to making knives and this answered several questions for me. Thanks a ton.
Bladesmith,30tb4n,thegreatdivide,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:03:31 2015 UTC,Why are there two small holes in the fire bricks? Is it for venting or something?
Bladesmith,30tb4n,BartimaeusTheFat,2,Mon Mar 30 22:56:58 2015 UTC,The hole in the side is where I stick the torch.  The one in the back is to allow some heat to flow in that direction rather than just forward so the whole length of the forge heats up evenly.  That was my thinking anyway.
Bladesmith,30tb4n,BartimaeusTheFat,1 point,Mon Mar 30 23:49:15 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Do you partially cover it?
Bladesmith,30tb4n,BartimaeusTheFat,2,Tue Mar 31 00:35:48 2015 UTC,"No, I don't cover either one of them.  I partially cover the front hole when I'm first heating up the forge, though."
Bladesmith,30tb4n,Triingtoohard,1 point,Tue Mar 31 00:37:41 2015 UTC,"Love the detail you went into. Would you do the same for, say, a bow?"
Bladesmith,30tb4n,BartimaeusTheFat,2,Tue Mar 31 00:39:50 2015 UTC,"I've already got a few bow build alongs on my web page. The most detailed one is the ""red oak board bow"" build along. http://poorfolkbows.com"
Bladesmith,30tb4n,Erfbender,2,Tue Mar 31 01:14:22 2015 UTC,"That's the buildalong I used when I started my first bow. Helped me so much, and the same goes for this knife buildalong. Thanks for posting. And I liked the single page, much simpler to read, especially on my phone."
Bladesmith,30tb4n,mikehino,2,Wed Apr 1 02:31:07 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm going to start doing it that way from now on, then."
Bladesmith,30vwgo,Msmith589,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:13:47 2015 UTC,I think most production machetes are 1070 or similar.  They're soft for ease of sharpening and so they don't shatter.  A lot of people use machete to refer to things that are not machetes.  You may want to be more specific about what you want to make.
Bladesmith,30vwgo,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:37:07 2015 UTC,"Im just wondering, what is a machete?"
Bladesmith,30vwgo,yangxiaodong,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:29:43 2015 UTC,"i wouldn't think that spring steel would be a problem, you'll just have to get used to the different characteristics of the steel from other machetes which are typically more rigid. the spring steel is going to have a lot more flex than something like high carbon, so your chops will have to be altered some or you'll be bending the steel when you don't want to and lose chopping power/risk damage.  what are your intended dimensions, how long and how thick do you figure you'll end up with."
Bladesmith,30vwgo,free_will_is_arson,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:04:46 2015 UTC,I haven't really thought of dimensions really yet
Bladesmith,30vwgo,free_will_is_arson,1 point,Fri Apr 3 00:08:06 2015 UTC,"i was just curious about possible flexiness, obviously the longer and thinner, the more wobble you're going to get out of it. then again, that might work in your favour, get more of a snap out of it, maybe."
Bladesmith,30vwgo,boxingnun,0,Fri Apr 3 00:46:36 2015 UTC,"1095 or O1.  I prefer plain high-carbon steel but O1 performs equally well.  I have a friend with a machete made from spring steel and he has no complaints, though I have never used one made from spring steel myself.    What kind of handle material do you plan to use?"
Bladesmith,30vwgo,boxingnun,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:02:55 2015 UTC,Not really sure what I was going to use for handle material any suggestions

Bladesmith,30rwje,blackrabt,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:14:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I think for a first go, it turned out pretty awesome."
Bladesmith,30rwje,perfunctificus,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:17:05 2015 UTC,"Not bad!  Looks like you sharpened it?  Has it been heat treated yet?  If not, you want to leave that for after HT.  Most people would say to leave it for dead last."
Bladesmith,30rwje,perfunctificus,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:36:33 2015 UTC,"It's still actually a bit thicker than it needs to be. A friend of mine took a look at it yesterday, and said that he usually goes a hair thinner before heat treat. We dint have enough time to heat treat it, so that will come in the next week or 2 when I can get back out to the shop again."
Bladesmith,30rwje,morchella,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, hard to tell exactly from the picture, looked like it already had  a secondary bevel."
Bladesmith,30rwje,morchella,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:19:27 2015 UTC,"Looks to me like you ground it a little to high over the spine. For a full flat grind, you want to stop shy of the spine."
Bladesmith,30rwje,StandForMe,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:37:42 2015 UTC,It turned into more of a convex grind than a flat grind.
Bladesmith,30rwje,StandForMe,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:14:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know or never heard of a full convex grind.  When I started on my first knife, I made the same mistake working on a full flat grind. The convex is applied to the edge for extra strength. Keep plugin' you'll get it down."
Bladesmith,30swke,allsortsofmeow,3,Mon Mar 30 13:08:17 2015 UTC,"4mm is good for a camp knife, I'm making one at the moment from 4mm O1.   For kitchen knives 2-3mm covers most things. You might struggle here without a belt grinder though, you can't file heat treated knives and you can't reliably grind 01 or 1095 to the thickness of a kitchen knife without the risk of severe warping. I got around this problem by using stainless that can be filed to it's final geometry then vacuum treated."
Bladesmith,30swke,wkirbys,1 point,Wed Apr 1 04:11:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. What width do you generally go for in terms of bar stock? Where I am the best option seems limited to about an inch and a half, which really just doesn't seem sufficient.  The heat treat remarks make a lot of sense, I can recall seeing Trollskyy heat treat after very minimal shaping, then grinding."
Bladesmith,30swke,wkirbys,1 point,Wed Apr 1 12:28:18 2015 UTC,"1.5"" stock is wide enough for plenty of things. I used 1.5"" stock for 2 chef knives, they were only 7.5"" knives though."
Bladesmith,30swke,wkirbys,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:19:12 2015 UTC,Any pictures you could share? I'm having trouble gripping the dimensions in my head. I use primarily Victorinox knives and they're all around 2-3 inches at the widest part.
Bladesmith,30swke,fernando_69,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:49:43 2015 UTC,"https://i.imgur.com/4ReiugZ.jpg  This was my first knife, 185mm length 38mm blade height. The 2nd is currently out for heat treat but is very similar.  38mm is quite typical for sabatier of that size. Gyutos are a bit wider, normally 40-45mm for a 180mm."
Bladesmith,30swke,RDalman,2,Fri Apr 3 03:34:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Nice knife also, the pattern in the wood is beautiful."

Bladesmith,30swke,toyfulskerl,1 point,Mon Apr 13 06:22:34 2015 UTC,"Think about how you want to use the camping knife. Unless you're making some larger chopper you want alot of weight to I think you would be best off in the 2-3mm range.  Depending on your HT provider, they may be able to run O1 in vacuum oven. You could check with them and if that's the case you can go thin before HT."
Bladesmith,30swke,toyfulskerl,1 point,Wed Apr 1 13:45:06 2015 UTC,"Oh awesome, thank you. Luckily time isn't a constraint, and work is all I ever do, so paying extra for good heat treat is completely within my means. Do you have any info on how vacuum oven prevents warp? Metallurgy in steel is crazy interesting, albeit just as crazy complex.   The camp knife will be an all round use, but definitely not for batoning. I have a flippin' axe for that. A tool for every job suits me best."
Bladesmith,30swke,jdub75,1 point,Wed Apr 1 13:48:39 2015 UTC,"No I don't really know the science behind it. But I know my HT guys ran my first O1 blades succesfully in their vacuum oven, and said they prefer to use it since it prevents warping."
Bladesmith,30swke,nomerkiah,2,Wed Apr 1 18:34:28 2015 UTC,"No worries, I suppose that's what google is for isn't it haha. You've given me something to procrastinate with at work, for that I am in your debt."
Bladesmith,30ruey,brutnus,1 point,Mon Mar 30 04:09:34 2015 UTC,How did you cut that out?

Bladesmith,30psz6,Msmith589,-2,Sun Mar 29 17:34:58 2015 UTC,How many times was this folded?
Bladesmith,30psz6,Herlt,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:45:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was. This was done via stock removal, according to the OP. It was made from a rasp, and you can still see the original abrasive pattern from the rasp where he didn't grind it off. I'm curious about the heat treat, though. A sushi knife should be pretty hard (61-64 HRC imo so it can hold an edge without taking one very easily) so I don't know how precise this method of manufacture is in comparison to what's required for the type of knife that op made."
Bladesmith,30psz6,UncleJehmimah,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:03:57 2015 UTC,Personally I don't believe I reached full potential hardness. I was looking to make a quick knife while I was waiting on the w2 I ordered. I got it to estimated temp with my brake drum forge then tempered at just under 400F for an hour
Bladesmith,30psz6,UncleJehmimah,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:51:27 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, most applications don't require extremely accurate temperature regulation in the heat treat process. If you get it approximately correct, it's fine. I still haven't built a kiln/forge to treat blades in, and that's something I'm looking to do soon. How do you measure the temperature in your forge?"
Bladesmith,30psz6,jd3p0,1 point,Mon Mar 30 04:35:05 2015 UTC,I pretty much just guess and gage by color I know it gets hot enough to melt steel
Bladesmith,30psz6,UncleJehmimah,0,Mon Mar 30 20:29:55 2015 UTC,"If you don't have a Forge to heat treat what are you basing your opinion on? The statement was so broad it is dangerous. Depending on the steel, the temp specs for heat treating are often very specific."
Bladesmith,30rg0g,Thegoodkev,2,Mon Mar 30 01:56:12 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of connections to the custom knife making world and im also a bladesmith, but without sketches or details of what you want its going to be hard. Do you have dimensions? steels you want? balance? Some guys make the best small blades while others focus on larger pieces. Do you want this to be fully tempered heat treated or ground or is this a decorative piece."
Bladesmith,30rg0g,Benman415,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:27:41 2015 UTC,"I want the blade to be 2 feet long, that's just the blade though. I was hoping to have it almost evenly balanced, just a bit top heavy. I don't know much about different steel types, what differences should I be looking for so I can decided what I want. I also don't want a decorative piece, I believe in function and form. Do you want me to upload the sketch so you could maybe advise me further?"
Bladesmith,30rg0g,Benman415,5,Mon Mar 30 04:24:27 2015 UTC,you really have to give me a mock up before i can give you any sort of info
Bladesmith,30rg0g,dzlux,1 point,Mon Mar 30 04:51:07 2015 UTC,"If you have not progressed beyond the drawings, you might consider mocking up the knife with foam or something like balsa wood that is very easy to shape.  I used oak and balsa to mock up the steel and handles for my first knife design, and it only took an hour to shape and learn what I needed to change before working with steel."
Bladesmith,30rg0g,dzlux,1 point,Mon Mar 30 04:04:31 2015 UTC,Do you mean I should make a model of it out of wood 1st? I unfortunately do not have any trade skills to work with. Do I just get a big log and shape it down from there?
Bladesmith,30oezw,tossik,12,Sun Mar 29 06:09:52 2015 UTC,Haha I don't know about the 'design based on a number of designs' part: http://i.imgur.com/wNSXoO5.jpg  However that is by far the nicest copy I've seen to date! Very nice work and well done to your brother!  -Aaron
Bladesmith,30oezw,aarongough,2,Sun Mar 29 13:58:48 2015 UTC,"Haha, yah this is one of them. There's a few other around, so no idea who's the original designer."
Bladesmith,30oezw,aarongough,2,Sun Mar 29 16:21:25 2015 UTC,"Ah, sorry I wasn't clear enough. The original designer is me! The jig in the photo I linked is one I designed a few years back and still use to this day."
Bladesmith,30oezw,VaguelyHonest,2,Sun Mar 29 16:23:51 2015 UTC,Just wondering. Do you ever use your previous file based jig that you made or do you just use this all the time since you made it?
Bladesmith,30oezw,aarongough,3,Sun Mar 29 16:57:40 2015 UTC,When I'm making knives for customers I purely use the grinding jig now. If I'm doing an instructional video then I will use the filing jig.
Bladesmith,30oezw,VaguelyHonest,2,Sun Mar 29 22:24:26 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Thanks for the response!
Bladesmith,30oezw,aarongough,3,Sun Mar 29 22:31:31 2015 UTC,Any time mate!
Bladesmith,30oezw,y0jimbo,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:38:22 2015 UTC,Oh sweet! Good design. We like it so far. We keep tweeting it still. All trial and error to get it perfect. But it does a good job
Bladesmith,30oezw,aarongough,2,Sun Mar 29 16:57:15 2015 UTC,Any way to get the plans for this? I've been having difficulty figuring out the attachment portion from the horizontal piece to the upright angle.
Bladesmith,30oezw,y0jimbo,3,Sun Mar 29 08:51:23 2015 UTC,"I have a full album of the original jig here: http://imgur.com/a/ffxVM  There are no plans as yet, I'm probably going to come up with a simplified version that I will release once it's done. I've also been asked by quite a number of people to make a run of these which is something I might do down the line.  In the meantime if you have a question about the design just let me know!"
Bladesmith,30oezw,thesirenlady,2,Sun Mar 29 14:00:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm assuming that you're using the methodology where you would mark the edge at the midpoint with a drill bit. When you're grinding, are you facing the blade up to ensure that you have your eye on the grindline, or are you facing the blade down and periodically pulling back to check to see if you've crossed the line? I guess I'll just have to wait for a video, but I am interested to see how you do this. If you do make one for public release, I may be interested as well."
Bladesmith,30oezw,aarongough,2,Sun Mar 29 15:44:41 2015 UTC,Mark the lines and then using a worn belt grind down to the line with very steep angles   Firstly this will limit the amout of grit stripped off a fresh belt by the edge of the steel  and second it gives a much clearer visual indicator of the position of your bevel.
Bladesmith,30oezw,y0jimbo,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:37:57 2015 UTC,"I mark the centerline using a height gauge but the principal is the same. The blade goes into the jig with the edge facing up and I do all my grinding like that.  I tend to do all my rough grinding on the jig, then take it out of the jig and do any finish grinding freehand."
Bladesmith,30oezw,thesirenlady,1 point,Sun Mar 29 16:11:53 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd definitely be interested in either building one manually, if you decide to make a kit so I could build one myself, or a direct purchase (of course, cost permitting.. )"
Bladesmith,30oezw,thegreatdivide,1 point,Sun Mar 29 16:45:16 2015 UTC,We can make one for you :) pm me if interested.
Bladesmith,30oezw,aarongough,2,Sun Mar 29 16:59:45 2015 UTC,"Make a rest that adjusts angles, and then all you need for your jig is a squared up length of wood.  An adjustable rest is also far more versatile than a square one."
Bladesmith,30oezw,thegreatdivide,1 point,Sun Mar 29 09:06:58 2015 UTC,No plans here. Just trial and error. Let me know if we can answer questions.
Bladesmith,30oezw,aarongough,2,Sun Mar 29 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"Right on! That looks great. I'd love to make one. When you get a chance, please post more pics."

Bladesmith,30lody,Skeletongotcha,11,Sat Mar 28 14:40:00 2015 UTC,"Well, from what I read about swords a long time ago: a long blade has two vibration nodes. As the blade vibrates the tip and handle displace in the same direction while the middle part displaces in the opposite. The vibration nodes are the points that do not displace.   For a sword you want one vibration node at the point where the blade meets the target (only applicable for chopping style swords, not stabbing or cutting) and one about 10 cm in front of your hand. You can see the vibration nodes by holding your blade vertically tip down with a gentle grip and set it into vibration by a gentle knock.   Changing the vibration pattern and the location of vibration nodes requires changing weight distribution or stiffness. Adding weight to the handle maybe, or grinding it off the back of the blade? It's hard to say exactly what to do without knowing how it vibrates.   Sorry for bad english, its not my first language."
Bladesmith,30lody,Blacksnot,5,Sat Mar 28 15:44:52 2015 UTC,"/u/Skeletongotcha This is exactly right.  You might be able to find help in /r/physics, my thesis was on vibration and I might be able to mod my simulation program to do large objects but it would be tricky.  If you have a CAD model you could send me or a precise set of measurements of the blade I could simulate it for you.  PM me."
Bladesmith,30lody,kaosChild,3,Sun Mar 29 01:34:07 2015 UTC,"Also known as the point of percussion.   In baseball, the sweet spot on the bat is the point of percussion.   I think in physics, it's the point on an object where all the mass of said object can be assumed to be when an object is rotated around an axis. So at the point of percussion, the integral of r(dm) (of the whole object) is equal to mr²."
Bladesmith,30lody,Ahandgesture,2,Sun Mar 29 04:46:29 2015 UTC,Interesting stuff.
Bladesmith,30lody,wkirbys,3,Sat Mar 28 19:31:09 2015 UTC,"Drilling a couple lightening holes into the handle would stiffen it under vibration.  Round holes actually help attenuate energy, like arches in buildings.  Of course adding a thicker handle would be the best solution."
Bladesmith,30lody,KnotSoSalty,2,Sat Mar 28 16:23:38 2015 UTC,"Does it have a handle? I assume it does but you didn't specify anything. If so, what's it made from?"
Bladesmith,30lody,Fargraven,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:40:33 2015 UTC,"It is a simple Paracord wrap on it, would it help it if I made a true wooden handle for it?"
Bladesmith,30lody,Fargraven,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:15:39 2015 UTC,"It's odd that it's doing that, but my guess is that a wooden handle would help."
Bladesmith,30lody,thesirenlady,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:21:19 2015 UTC,It is to the point that after about 10- 20 minutes of using it in brush my hand is sore from the vibrations. I am going to try a wooden handle and maybe look into putting some lightening holes in the handle area and towards the front of the blade.

Bladesmith,30awbq,Reziik,4,Wed Mar 25 21:58:21 2015 UTC,Yes you can cut your bevels with files. Many people start out with a filing jig https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9iNDRwwBQQ  It's much slower going compared to a belt grinder but the results can be just as good.
Bladesmith,30awbq,wkirbys,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:20:32 2015 UTC,"alright that actually looks like it would work well, how long about does it take though?"
Bladesmith,30awbq,wkirbys,3,Wed Mar 25 22:27:02 2015 UTC,Depends. For a medium sized knife you're probably looking at 1-2 hours of actual heavy filing but there are many additional hours of pondering and going slow while trying to get everything clean and even at first.
Bladesmith,30awbq,TheMadSmith,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:35:10 2015 UTC,alright thats not bad at all ill definitely give it a try. thanks.
Bladesmith,30awbq,TheMadSmith,3,Wed Mar 25 22:43:55 2015 UTC,A good set of files and some time is really all you need. Alternatively if you've got an extra 30-40 bucks to spend you can get a 1x30 belt sander from Harbor Freight that hundreds of makers have used in the beginning to place bevels (myself included). Try to get a good quality set of files if you can. (Nicholson's if you're in the US) Also look into building a filing jig (a la Aaron Gough from GoughCustoms)

Bladesmith,30awbq,Fargraven,2,Wed Mar 25 22:45:20 2015 UTC,"Harbor Freight has an online store and ships internationally to my knowledge. Also, check your cheap tool stores ( I think I remember a Canadian one called Canadian Tire?) for deals. If all else fails, there is the file route, or you could save up for a bit and get the one for $120. It takes some time to look around for the best deal."

Bladesmith,309z6x,yangxiaodong,17,Wed Mar 25 17:59:56 2015 UTC,"Most knifemakers, including me, draw a distinction between a ""knife-shaped object"" and a knife, and we consider hardness to be a requirement of a knife.  Here is a great reference for heat-treating O1.  The steps are normalize, harden, then temper.  http://www.cashenblades.com/steel/o1.html  It is possible to find prehardened steel.  A lot of knifemakers, including me, would heat-treat your knife for a nominal fee."
Bladesmith,309z6x,FlyingSteel,8,Wed Mar 25 20:42:56 2015 UTC,Upvoting  because it pisses  me off when the right answer gets down voted.   Hardening is part of making a knife and that's how it is.
Bladesmith,309z6x,doublesecretprobatio,3,Thu Mar 26 00:30:32 2015 UTC,"All that you really ""need"" to do to make a knife is sharpen up some metal. However, without proper heat treating the knife will never be as sharp or as durable as it could have been. If you aren't planning on heat treating I would advise to not spend your money in O1. You could also, however, send off to a commercial heat treating facility."
Bladesmith,309z6x,kingswee,3,Wed Mar 25 18:03:35 2015 UTC,Absolutely right. The knife will basically be a decorative piece without heat treatment.
Bladesmith,309z6x,sandmansleepy,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:47:33 2015 UTC,"alright then. Also, after heating it to around 400 degrees ( i heard that's how hot it should be) how long can i have it in air before i submerge it into oil? i've got a fireproof area to quench it in, but it would probably take 20 seconds or so to get there so that i dont hurt anyone."
Bladesmith,309z6x,kingswee,6,Wed Mar 25 20:06:07 2015 UTC,"That's not the process. I don't have time to give you the full dish on it right now, but if you are interested just lookup O1 heat treating. Now that I think of it, Walter Sorrels and Aaron Gough both have good videos on Youtube on making O1 blades with minimal tool. You may want to look them up."
Bladesmith,309z6x,A-Grey-World,3,Wed Mar 25 20:30:57 2015 UTC,It sounds like you really don't know what you are doing... I'd really advise you to read up on the three processes involved:  Normalizing Hardening Tempering  Take kingswee's advice and watch some videos on the subject.
Bladesmith,309z6x,free_will_is_arson,-1,Thu Mar 26 10:18:44 2015 UTC,"people who know more about this, correct me if im wrong here.   your annealing process is around 400o f -- when you heat it slightly to release tensions created by the quench, reducing it's brittleness, than allowed to naturally cool. but the actual quench tempt is much higher, like 1800o f. and 20s from heat to quench is quite long, long enough to allow a change in temperature between surface and inner material and will mostly likely cause some sort of damage, be it fractures or warping or inconsistent heat treatment.  if your fireproof area can't be moved to your heat source i would look into moving your heat source to your fire proof area. if needed, mcgyvering a makeshift forge isn't that difficult and would probably help greatly in speeding up the transition to the quench tank."
Bladesmith,309z6x,thesirenlady,6,Wed Mar 25 20:47:40 2015 UTC,"Tempering is the name of the lower temperature process. It can range anywhere from 300 to 1000 depending on the steel and the application.  Most knife applications are around the 400 mark.  Annealing is the process of softening the steel to a point of workability. If you're a stock removal knifemaker, working with brand new steel you should never need to anneal anything.  Austenizing temperature, when you should quench, also changes depending on the steel. a basic carbon steel like 1084 is around 1550, but a stainless steel like 154CM is 1950.   and 20s from heat to quench is quite long, long enough to allow a change in temperature between surface and inner material and will mostly likely cause some sort of damage, be it fractures or warping or inconsistent heat treatment.   no, not really."
Bladesmith,309z6x,tingting2,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:18:15 2015 UTC,"oh.  So a ""soup can"" forge would work for tempering?"
Bladesmith,309z6x,WhateverIWantToDo,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:06:09 2015 UTC,"A soup can forge wouldn't work for ""tempering"". It would for the quench portion of the process. This takes place at a much higher temperature than the tempering process. Tempering for O-1 is 400f. This can be done in your standard oven no problem. The quench step needs to bring the steel to 1500f then cooled quickly in oil. Hope this helps."
Bladesmith,309z6x,tingting2,1 point,Thu Mar 26 12:01:25 2015 UTC,alright then. How would i see what temperature it is? it seems kinda hard to check if it's even within a hundred degrees.
Bladesmith,309z6x,tingting2,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:27:44 2015 UTC,"one quick way to see if the metal is hot enough is to magnet test it. When the steel reaches its critical temperature a magnet will no longer stick to it, and it is ready to quench. Obviously this is a bit of a hack, different steels behave differently, but in a pinch it works."
Bladesmith,309z6x,free_will_is_arson,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:59:17 2015 UTC,I meant more with being too hot. Would a hard drive magnet work to check it?
Bladesmith,309z6x,free_will_is_arson,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:36:11 2015 UTC,Non magnetic is 1425. Use that as a standard to judge by. Any magnet will work. I heat to a dull red and test.
Bladesmith,309z6x,ShadNuke,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:12:48 2015 UTC,"After testing at dull red, and the steel is non-magnetic, i stick It back in for 5 seconds this will take it to the optimum tempo 1475 or so and then quench."

Bladesmith,3075vh,jedi_knt,1 point,Wed Mar 25 02:59:23 2015 UTC,"The kind you have are used because they are tough. Low density brick provides a far greater level of insulation, allowing your forge to get hotter, faster, using less gas."

Bladesmith,305kgq,tulsavw,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:41:34 2015 UTC,What's decarb mean?
Bladesmith,305kgq,iolithblue,1 point,Wed Mar 25 09:49:20 2015 UTC,What I understand it as (read about forging W1 online before I started making slightly more expensive mistakes):  Carbon migrating away from the surface after too many heats which leaves an edge or surface with lower and less hardenable steel.
Bladesmith,305kgq,Scuzzbag,0,Wed Mar 25 17:40:26 2015 UTC,"Steels that hold an edge well have a (relatively) high carbon content. The oxy burns the steel to cut it, and so effects the content of carbon in the steel. I'd imagine it would only be in the heat affected zone, but a knife ain't real big."
Bladesmith,305kgq,Scuzzbag,-1,Wed Mar 25 11:19:53 2015 UTC,"It actually uses an advanced chemical reaction called oxidation to get through, rather than ""burning"", per sae. But it may affect the carbon content nonetheless"
Bladesmith,301ux7,bathsaltzombie420,8,Mon Mar 23 20:21:03 2015 UTC,That right there is an interesting looking blade.  What's it's intended purpose? I like the detail with the pins...planning to try something similar myself.
Bladesmith,301ux7,kliman,8,Mon Mar 23 20:30:24 2015 UTC,"It was just another practice piece. Not really created for any purpose other than general use. The blade was about 2"" bigger but it bent during quenching and I broke it trying to straighten it :/ Got a bunch of old Nicholson files from a yard sale for like $4 so got a lot more to practice on!"
Bladesmith,301ux7,Fargraven,5,Mon Mar 23 20:35:02 2015 UTC,"Wow that design is...interesting. I'm not sure about its practicality, but that looks really amazing. What type of wood is the handle?"

Water it down 10 to 1, and then do quick successive soaks.  Put in for about 60 seconds, then wash it in water, and Windex(or any other base to neutralize) and the scrub the steel with a soft t-shirt and a mild metal polish.  It will take the oxides off, and leave the steel a ""steely"" grey that everyone always imagines steel to be.  Do this multiple times to get the steel darker.  This is also an excellent way to show hamons.   I loathe mirror polishes."

Bladesmith,2zxcm1,kenofthesea,9,Sun Mar 22 18:30:41 2015 UTC,"Here's mine.  Made up as I went along, loosely based on the no-weld just from a few pictures, but I just went to the steel yard and bought a pile of off-cuts that the sell by the pound, and started cutting.  With a welder it makes life a lot easier, since you can just stick anything to anything else.  Quite happy with the results, runs the same leeson 2hp as the KMG.  The budget minus motor was 200 something.  Paid 300 for the motor I think."
Bladesmith,2zxcm1,perfunctificus,6,Sun Mar 22 21:45:50 2015 UTC,I had built a no weld first and then later a KMG clone.  If you have got access to a welder I actually think the KMG comes together quicker and easier.  You dont need nearly as thick steel as whats in the plans. I think I made most of mine out of 10mm.  The KMG does perform much better though
Bladesmith,2zxcm1,thesirenlady,4,Sun Mar 22 21:23:56 2015 UTC,"I think any of those (NWG, GIB) or other clones can make excellent grinders, but you still have to get all your idler and contact wheels, TEFC motor etc. and by the time you get all that you're up close to $1000. Then if you want to add a variable speed controller, more $$$$. Plus your time and hassle if you suck at putting stuff like that together, I always feel I spend twice the amount of time building something like that than it should reasonably take!"
Bladesmith,2zxcm1,weps_grd_pandemonium,3,Sun Mar 22 19:39:59 2015 UTC,"I'm having this great debate with myself as well.  On one hand I don't want to shell out almost $3k for a decent grinder but on the other hand, I don't want to waste 100 hours building something sub par.  I'm leaning towards spending the big bucks and just buying one so I can spend the time I would be building a grinder getting better at making knives.

Bladesmith,2zudlj,BigBear50,3,Sat Mar 21 21:31:22 2015 UTC,It looks a lot like a prop master for the show bought a cheap bowie knife blank. Then cut off the tang and screwed some polished aluminum in between some shaped aluminum scales that have a matte steel wool finish. That way a dummy knife with a rubber blade would be just as easy to make. I think if you bought a bowie blank and took it to a local machine shop one of the workers could make it in their off time. It would probably be more accurate as it wasn't made expensively in the first place.

Bladesmith,2ztjbm,BradenGV,3,Sat Mar 21 17:06:06 2015 UTC,"I built one. At first the bevel was taking for ever with the old file I was using, then I bought a ""Miracle File"" by Nicholson on Amazon ($20 or so with shipping). Man, that file is awesome. It can leave a rough ""grooved"" finish if you aren't careful, but once you get the hang of it, it's a great file. Also, once the basic bevel was made I smoothed out the surface with my old, finer file. Worked out great. I also annealed my steel before filing the bevel. The  blades I am making are somewhat non traditional shaped, so the ""center aligned"" holes in the jig for positioning the blade weren't working out for me- so I just drilled some new holes that were where I needed them. No biggie. Maybe ignorance is bliss, and I don't know any better as to how much time a bevel should take, but the bevels on my first knife with the jig took about 1 1/2 hours per side. Also, I learned that if you are going to keep each side of the blade symmetrical while shaping the bevel, once your blade is clamped to the jig where you want it, trace around it with a pencil so that if you need to remove the blade to file the opposite side, then return to work on the first side, you can return it to its original position.I learned the hard way with a 4 x 36 belt sander that you can ruin a bevel quickly. After ruining a couple- then using Aaron's jig, showed me it's definitely worth the time filing the bevel by hand. I understand there are jigs that can be  for using with a sander or belt grinder that are much quicker, but there is a certain satisfaction I got making my bevel by hand. Maybe one day I'll buy a nicer belt sander/grinder for bevel making, but until then, Aaron's jig will suffice.... Dude- buy good files.  edit: Sorry for being so ""wordy"". At times I don't know when to shut up.  EDIT again: ""Magic File"" not ""miracle file""....oops"
Bladesmith,2ztjbm,thegreatdivide,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:13:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for this reply! On the tracing part, after you trace to you just try to kinda center it up the best you can or is there a certain method?"
Bladesmith,2ztjbm,thegreatdivide,2,Sun Mar 22 14:16:37 2015 UTC,"I'm still learning- actually just beginning to learn so you can take my advice how you'd like....but When I first clamp the blade to the jig- I trace around it with a pencil once I have the bolt for making the plunge line (or plunge cut) where it needs to be- then do my filing just like on aaron goughs video. I try to  follow his technique the best I can. Then, when it comes time to do the 2nd side, the outline I made will visually help me position the blade- or mirror the placement of the blade for side two. Maybe what I am saying and doing isn't necessary, but my thinking is that if you want each bevel to be even as possible, then the blade placement for filing the 2nd sides bevel needs to be a close to the placement of the first side so as you file, you are hitting each side at as close to the same angle as possible ....I guess... You might have to adjust a little - as your blade placement may not be able to be placed exactly mirrored to the first side- because the bolt holes on the jig might not be exactly even at each end of the jig. Does that make sense? Like I said, I am a total newbie man. I am making 2 knives right now that I cut out of an old table saw blade- so I haven't even bought good knife making steel. I thought I'd practice learning on a saw blade first. But I have the knife making fever...any way- back to the jig- like I said on my previous post- I had been using a very old and dull file, then bought that miracle file I told you about based on what someone else posted. That file is great- I just can't stress that enough. Any way- maybe we can stay in touch as we are both learning.One more thing- because the blade I am currently making is somewhat curved and long, while I file on it the ""tip end"" of the blade wanted to move upwards- so I screwed another screw into the jig very close to the end of the blade to stop this moving. I just screwed it ALMOST all the way into the wood so a very little bit of the screw sticks up becoming a ""stop"". I just had to keep the screw head the same ""height"" or ""depth"" as what the blade is so my file won't hit it...I hope this make sense. I hope I this helps and isn't the wrong advice."

I don't think there is much to tweak, but I am going to drill out the holes in the wood, then use an insert so the eye bolt can be screwed into the jig longer. Basically, just adding more life to the wood. Other than that, I am just in the process of building one, and hope to get started today or tomorrow on it. Maybe someone else will chime in for some other ideas to make it better. Oh, I also thought of getting a handful of eye bolts, and making them each dedicated to specific angles, along with one that isn't specified to an angle. Kinda makes for more precise angles. But I'm just a bit anal haha"

Bladesmith,2zsyfk,zurgonvrits,2,Sat Mar 21 22:23:02 2015 UTC,I gathered a few things from your post. It not  my  intention to be rude or to hurt your feelings.  You have not done enough study and research. Go have a look at this website :  hypefreeblades.com   Even if you have already taken delivery of the W2 and the 52100 don't use it yet. Order some 1084 in 0.125 thickness from this website :  newjerseysteelbaron.com   I offer one piece of information that you should look up yourself to confirm : non-magnetic is not hot enough. Non-magnetic is just about 100 degrees F too cool. There is no need to soak 1084 at temp - just get it to 1475 degrees F and quench it. Canola oil at 130 degrees F will work just fine.  You can buy Tempsticks on Amazon that will put you right on the money.   Buy a cheap laser temp gun at Harbor Freight to calibrate your  kitchen oven. Temper two times at one hour at 375 degrees F and one at 400 degrees  F.  First shoot a cookie sheet with the HF gun  to make sure the oven is stablized at temp. Put the blade on the rack not the cookie sheet. Getting the first temp stablized should take about an hour.   Multiple quenches are hogwash.   Read and learn more. 99.999% of what you read on most blade forums is nonsense. The knife dog forum is not too bad. Hypefreeblades.com is about the best that there is but it is not for people who enjoy fairy tales and blue smoke and bull shit .

Bladesmith,2zrn45,Kurt369,4,Sat Mar 21 02:06:02 2015 UTC,"Locate your holes but make them well undersize otherwise the taper from the WJ can cause the backside of the hole to be oversize before you know it.  I ask for a 2mm hole for a 1/8 pin, 1mm hole for a 2-56 screw, 3mm for a 3/16 pivot and 5mm for a 1/4 pivot.  Have them cut 98% of the lockbar, leaving a small bit attached at the lockface. This will ensure that the frame stays flat and rigid whilst you do the rest of your operations, particularly the relieving.  This is one of the ones I had cut recently. Instead of making the lockbar shortened I actually added a bit of 'extra meat' around the front finger notch, so when im ready to free up the lockbar i just have to grind it down to the proper profile which intersects with the cut.   Work on frame and lock etc while blade is at heat treat   just make sure that your open and closed positions are more or less set, and your detent hole is drilled before sending off for HT. Otherwise its #54 carbide drills and such. Very fragile, quite expensive."
Bladesmith,2zrn45,thesirenlady,2,Sat Mar 21 02:56:22 2015 UTC,Thanks!   Now when I get parts to the WJ should I have it cut the exact dimensions of it all or pus a little buffer all the way around? the lock face on the blade?   To set the frame lock its self do I just bend it in by hand?  Is there any sort of reference to look at when designing the flipper location and the detent location to ensure it actually flips?
Bladesmith,2zrn45,thesirenlady,2,Sat Mar 21 11:45:19 2015 UTC,"if you have something critical to do with the outside edge like the edge matching the edge of a standoff, concealing the detent hole or path then have a little extra, otherwise you probably wont get yourself into trouble by cutting a close outside shape.  definitely dont cut the lockface though  Use a piece of wood with a slot just wider than the Ti thickness to bend the bar. slot it over close to the front and push the bar perpendicular to the length of the frame, this should ensure a proper engagement angle and allows you to get both hands on the bar for more precise control.  The point of the flipper tab that contacts the finger should be directly above the pivot for the best leverage.  Detent location wont affect flipper action, so long as it doesnt fall off and on the blade. given the width of your lockbar theres not a huge amount of wiggle room for its location  Resource?"
Bladesmith,2zrn45,thesirenlady,1 point,Sat Mar 21 13:21:49 2015 UTC,"How does one choose the lock-bar relief location, either inside or outside, and the size of the relief?"
Bladesmith,2zrn45,thesirenlady,1 point,Sat Mar 21 17:13:43 2015 UTC,whatever floats your boat. I just use a 12mm carbide endmill and go straight in straight out. it leaves a somewhat crisp edge so i put it on the inside to avoid discomfort.  also means i dont have to get rid of the machining marks.  Relieve to around 1.5mm material remaining

Bladesmith,2zr8nz,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Sat Mar 21 02:42:39 2015 UTC,They can be built for much less if you have some simple tools and some mechanical ability. There are plans readily available online.
Bladesmith,2zr8nz,FJ1906,2,Sat Mar 21 22:31:57 2015 UTC,"My opinion: 2x72 is definitely very nice and versatile, but if you're on a budget or a beginner, the 1x30 will be fine. I've been using it for a long time and I don't have issues.  As long as you're using it for small stuff like you said, and not something like stock removal. The small motor can't really handle heavy stock removal."
Bladesmith,2zr8nz,Fargraven,1 point,Sat Mar 21 01:28:27 2015 UTC,"stock removal is actually using it as a replacement/alternative to a hacksaw or cutting tool, right?  and im guessing that means that a 4x30 or something wouldnt be a good idea, even though it's more powerful (i can afford it, i'd just rather get the one that's ""right"")"
Bladesmith,2zr8nz,Fargraven,1 point,Sat Mar 21 01:38:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the belt sander would be used to clean up the rough edges after cutting.   I've only heard of a 6x36, but I assume a 4x30 is the same thing, just with a smaller belt. The main drawback is that it can't really be used for bevels. Smaller belts are usually better for them.  Plus it doesn't have any slack, so you can only work relatively flat areas   I have a 6x36 belt sander with an abrasive 40 grit bet, and it removes material very fast. But I don't need it too much. Occasionally for doing stock removal, but the large width and no slack means I can only really work along the spine of the knife."
Bladesmith,2zr8nz,Fargraven,1 point,Sat Mar 21 01:50:18 2015 UTC,Can I ask why a smaller belt is better for making bevels?
Bladesmith,2zr8nz,thesirenlady,1 point,Sat Mar 21 01:58:03 2015 UTC,"In my experience, the belts can be hard to properly tighten, and aren't flat with the track and can move left and right. So it can mess up your plunge lines, and even your handle if it's attached at that point.   Plus, mine can only be mounted horizontally. But it's an old one. Virtually all modern ones can mount vertically as well."
Bladesmith,2zr8nz,thesirenlady,1 point,Sat Mar 21 02:06:32 2015 UTC,"On large sanders, the bed is often wider than the belt.  The blade needs to be able to sort of push behind the belt in order to form a plunge line."
Bladesmith,2zr8nz,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Sat Mar 21 02:36:37 2015 UTC,"can you explain that? i understand for a recurve, but if im consistently moving the blade across it then that shouldnt cause an issue."
Bladesmith,2zr8nz,beaster456,1 point,Sat Mar 21 02:41:59 2015 UTC,"You understand a plunge line yeah?  assuming the 4x30 you're looking at is similar to this, you see how the steel frame of the sander is wider than the belt itself. So if you grind a piece of steel around that area it is only going to go as far as the thickness of the belt. So a cut like this just isnt possible, which is similar in concept to how a bevel is made  Unless you're making knives without plunge lines, ala some kitchen knives, you need that functionality."
Bladesmith,2zqei0,AZk2517,2,Fri Mar 20 19:39:49 2015 UTC,"Hardening is a yes or no question. Sort of. I won't go into the material science behind it (what little I know), but the basic idea is that if you get to the critical temp the steel has changed phases. When you rapidly cool (quench) from this phase, the steel hardens. If you quench from a little below the critical point a few things could happen, depending on your steel, which could result in slightly harder or softer steel.  As u/jp3592 pointed out, if your file skates across it, then it's hardened. There is a chance that it's not completely hardened. This is where we get to the ""sort of"" part of the answer. If the entire piece (including the internal) didn't reach the critical temp, then only the parts that did would be hardened. This results in a mix of hardened and unhardened steel, which is (as I've heard) very common for amateur bladesmiths without a ton of experience (like myself)."

Bladesmith,2znaz7,Bligggz,2,Fri Mar 20 01:51:04 2015 UTC,Why would you cut the blank out by drilling holes? Wouldn't it be way easier to use an angle grinder with a cutoff wheel?
Bladesmith,2znaz7,Erchi,4,Fri Mar 20 01:28:49 2015 UTC,"In a word, no. The angle grinder is also very slow when dealing with tough steels like these, and it's also loud, makes sparks, and is easy to miss with. It generates a ton of heat which can make your lines difficult to see.  One drill bit if kept properly cool can do at least a dozen blades, whereas cutoff discs wear out quickly.  A bandsaw would be great, but I've found this to be the next best."
Bladesmith,2znaz7,AlexFreire,2,Fri Mar 20 01:53:36 2015 UTC,I was wondering about that too. I do admit the cons of angle grinder. But on the other hand it is newbie friendly and even good ones are fairly cheap...
Bladesmith,2znaz7,AlexFreire,3,Fri Mar 20 10:45:44 2015 UTC,"That's true.

I have never done any blacksmithing   What?   how do you know you are getting the flat stock cut lengthwise, or the end of a very wide sheet?   Look at the side edges of the bar. If it looks rough, then it was likely cut by shear.  Probably 99% of steel you'll find.  5160 is most often used for leaf spring suspension so it is rolled to width, and should have a rounded edge  However, the chances of some muppet shearing the sheet the totally opposite way are pretty slim.

You can also make a grinding jig to help you get exact angles on your grinds, but I would highly recommend free-hand experience."
Bladesmith,2zje5t,stniesen,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:50:00 2015 UTC,"I will never (I hope) say I know everything. Or even a lot. But I know a little bit about knife making. I definitely lack in the experience department, and I'm working on that as I have time.  But I'll provide a couple of explanations (or excuses, if you prefer) for this particular sample. The first is that I can be impatient. I'm human, I guess. The second is that I had a time limit since I moved at the beginning of January and I have even less room here than I did there.  That being said, I learned volumes from this knife and when I have the chance to start on another, I think it will be leaps ahead in terms of quality."

Bladesmith,2zii46,Akelzero,5,Wed Mar 18 23:39:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe get a piece of wood. I think Home Depot or Lowes etc... sells 2' x 2' squares of plywood.  Mount vise to that, then clamp that to a sturdy table?  Could always put something between table and board to prevent scratching. It'd be removable that way  Otherwise, google image search for Vise Stand"
Bladesmith,2zii46,iamzombus,2,Wed Mar 18 21:54:39 2015 UTC,"Most of the suggestions in this thread are IMO poor excuses for a work bench.  You can make a simple work bench with 2x4's, 4x4's, and plywood.  There are dozens of designs out there.  My first bench had 4x4 legs, 2x4 frame with two sheets of 3/4"" plywood glued together and screwed to the frame.  Works fine.  You can do better with a torsion box top as they are stiffer for the same amount of material.  This is essentially a 2x4 rectangle with cross pieces sandwiched between two sheets of plywood.  And then mounted on top of some legs/frame concoction.  Lots of plans out there for that too.  If you're cramped for space this could work out ok, though you'd be unbolting the vise to close it up:  http://lumberjocks.com/projects/96828  If you need more specific suggestions I can hunt down an appropriate plan."

It's actually a stand for a power tool (such as a band saw or bench grinder or something) but my dad has been using it as a makeshift bench for his vice.  It's a little on the light side, but you can weigh it down with cinder blocks or something and for blade work, it should do just fine.  It may sit a little low, but that should be easy to solve, too.  You might be able to find something similar via craigslist or something.

The flaws around the spine you could still fix pretty easily.  The ones in the bevel are tougher after the handle is on.  It's that last hour that makes the difference between an okay knife and a good knife.  Don't stop until the flaws are gone, and get the sanding grain nice and straight (longways or horizontal), and this would be a beautiful knife.  Keep up the good work!"

Obviously the 1/3 HP motor can't handle things like pure stock removal, but for only $45 it's pretty nice. Some people are strongly against anything Harbor Freight, because a big 1HP 2x72 belt sander like this is pretty kickass and definitely more versatile, but if you're a beginner or on a budget the 1x30 is pretty good."

Bladesmith,2z4m8f,jp3592,1 point,Mon Mar 16 10:33:44 2015 UTC,I made one not long ago a month or two. I used a pump I got off of amazon a 1 gal pickle jar I just gave the pickles away that was only like 5 bucks then I just had to find some hose and fittings this was the hardest part. I ordered snake juice from turn tex I also grabbed a gauge so I would know how much vacuum I was pulling and it confirmed everything was ok. As far as a hand pump goes you would have to have a small chamber and I imagine it would still take a while. With my gallon sized chamber I will put 5 or so sets of scales in it at a time and it will sometimes take 24 hours or more to get all the bubbles out which is the only instruction timewise turntex gives on how long to pull vacuum. Result wise I haven't been impressed I have never had professionally stabilized wood but I don't think the results I am getting are that impressive and I am stabilizing everything at least twice . The whole reason I wanted to stabilize was to save me time later on putting several layers of tru-oil or tung oil on there but I am still using those products because the stabilizing isn't that great I don't know if I got a bad batch or if this is typical. So all in all I got about 200 bucks in a system that I'm not happy with the results I could have paid for alot of wood to be professionally stabilized for 200 bucks or bought 200 dollars worth of wood that didn't need to be stabilized to get a nice finish which is what I am doing from now on. Here is a list of woods that can be stabilized and woods that can't.

Bladesmith,2z38n8,rhizopogon,1 point,Sun Mar 15 03:51:02 2015 UTC,"Not big on the heel, the small curve in the edge is going to be a bitch to sharpen and not real upside. Also the index coil in the handle will limit you to one grip and one hand size. The pointed horn at the end of the handle will tear your hand apart if you try to choke back on it. A small, couple degree cant to the handle downwards would to it good in the ergos department. Looks like you're going for a scandi edge so I'd stick to 1/8"" stock but that's my opinion. It seems like a good blade but it's a very rough drawing. I personally don't care for the down pointed tip, I like a little more belly but it's your design. Good luck"
Bladesmith,2z38n8,cheeselord5,1 point,Sun Mar 15 05:27:14 2015 UTC,"looks a bit 2 dimensional :-P   if it were my knife i would break the angle at the ricasso. make the back point of the handle match the same plain of the point, using the center reference point at the part of the blade that meets the handle, or the mathematical center point (which ever has the best feel and look score).   that slightly angle fits so much better in the hand."
Bladesmith,2z38n8,zurgonvrits,1 point,Sun Mar 15 06:18:19 2015 UTC,I don't care for a lot of belly in a blade. This blade shape looks good.  If the handle is for you and it fits go for it.  I do agree with adding a  slight can't downward in the handle.
Bladesmith,2z38n8,Audidrift,1 point,Sun Mar 15 14:16:21 2015 UTC,Put a choil or do something to stop the blade before the small drop near the handle for sharpening. The back of the handle looks pretty sharp too but otherwise i do really like the general style of the knife.
Bladesmith,2z38n8,bobertlo,1 point,Sun Mar 15 18:32:14 2015 UTC,"the handle looks like it's getting a little too wide at the end, and the blade looks extremely long compared to the width and handle."

Bladesmith,2z04xm,thegreatdivide,2,Sat Mar 14 08:44:31 2015 UTC,"Really nice. Those handles are beautiful. I'm a newb to knife making- so excuse me for my ignorance- but what does ""D-handle"" mean? Also, are you heat treating in an electric kiln or a torch type kiln? Once again- those knives look great! You've inspired me to go to my shop and work on one now."
Bladesmith,2z04xm,Verrence,1 point,Sat Mar 14 13:37:59 2015 UTC,Thank you! D-handle is a handle shaped like a D sort of. Japanese knives often have them. For me a HT setup would be quite the investment so for now I send out for HT. I get each blade tested after HT so I know they are at the hardness I want for them.
Bladesmith,2z04xm,rugbtt,1 point,Sat Mar 14 13:48:51 2015 UTC,"So it's flatter on the thumb side?  I always do that when shaping handles, good to know it's actually a thing!"

Bladesmith,2z04xm,Fargraven,2,Sat Mar 14 15:13:46 2015 UTC,Can you tell us why you chose that geometry?  Work with any chefs or pattern them on any knives?
Bladesmith,2z04xm,Althurus,1 point,Sat Mar 14 20:53:22 2015 UTC,Yes it was based on critique from a chef testing my first prototype. He also thought the handle was too polished so I made a lower grit finish on these to retain some more grip.

Bladesmith,2yyrei,Verrence,1 point,Sat Mar 14 18:56:23 2015 UTC,"It's a test, sure. It separates the sharp knives from the unusable dull ones, but it doesn't really demonstrate the functionality of a blade. Cutting paper shows that you're capable of making a sharp knive, but it doesn't show how that knife holds an edge, or performs with different textured substances."
Bladesmith,2yyrei,UncleJehmimah,2,Sat Mar 14 19:09:22 2015 UTC,"A very sharp knife will cut through a whole sheet of paper in one glide. Cutting the whole way, not ripping. It's a classic test that's very commonly done."

Bladesmith,2yyqvz,Nappy2fly,8,Fri Mar 13 23:22:25 2015 UTC,"It can be if you get popular. You would have to hit every knife show you possibly can. Take time to talk to anyone who comes up to your table whether or not they buy anything. Make brochures and advertize. Some won't like what you do and they will obnoxiously tell you that, you have to take it with a smile and brush it off. Making knives for a living you almost have to be a better salesman than a knife maker."
Bladesmith,2yyqvz,CrazytownUSA00,5,Fri Mar 13 23:47:20 2015 UTC,"I tried going down that route for a while. I found that the time spent versus the selling price of a knife means you have to sell them for a lot more than the average person would want to spend... or end up working for a poor wage. But, like the other guy said, if you can get a following, it's doable. Not an easy task, though. It's mostly a feat of marketing more than a pure mechanical skill."
Bladesmith,2yyqvz,gumibear,3,Sat Mar 14 00:37:35 2015 UTC,"Really it's a luck of the draw, along with hard work. I was a hobby maker for 12 years before going full time, and even then it was my wife's income that made up for the fact that for 2 years nothing substantial was earned.

Bladesmith,2yyqvz,jp3592,2,Sun Mar 15 06:22:35 2015 UTC,"It's a fine line though between charging too much and not enough. So I try to skirt the middle as much as possible for my small knives, but know that on larger blades that's not always an option."
Bladesmith,2yyqvz,nighthaxan,1 point,Sun Mar 15 09:20:54 2015 UTC,I know you know more about selling knives and making knives than I do I guess I should have said I would be willing to pay alot more than you charge.

I also have a 55# harbor freight anvil.  It's not great.  Pretty soft but it was the next step up from using a piece of railroad track set vertically.  If you're just getting into get the 4x4 stake anvil.  It's actual tool steel at about twice the cost of the hf 55#."
Bladesmith,2yxhpd,sheepdogzero,6,Wed Mar 18 03:20:58 2015 UTC,"Generally not worth your time or money. I've heard that some of them are cast steel, which are usable, but most of them are cast iron. Do NOT get a cast iron one. You're much better off getting a large sledge hammer head and using that. I think they are around the same price as a harbor freight anvil (depending on size)."

Bladesmith,2yxhpd,Engvar,2,Fri Mar 13 17:35:27 2015 UTC,You can leave the handle on. Just make a hollow in a stump for it to sit in to add mass behind it.
Bladesmith,2yxhpd,Engvar,2,Fri Mar 13 17:51:12 2015 UTC,oh ok. would a wooden/metal stand work as well as long as it's sturdy? I live in an apartment and do most of my projects at my parents house. Not looking to make any sort of permanent set up like that until i own a house.
Bladesmith,2yxhpd,paulcam,2,Fri Mar 13 18:00:52 2015 UTC,"It will work better with mass behind it. You can honestly just put it on the ground.   An indent in a stump gives mass and prevents it from bouncing around when you strike. You can make a wooden stand also, but I wouldn't recommend metal just because it will be very loud."
Bladesmith,2yxhpd,Triingtoohard,4,Fri Mar 13 18:12:56 2015 UTC,Short version: No.  Long version: Nooooooooooooooooooo.  Think about what an anvil should do and then watch this video.

I've worked on nicer anvils, but the HF cast steel is significantly better than makeshift.   The hardy hole is oddly sized, and it's big for the size of the anvil, and oddly positioned, as well.  If you are just smithing blades, it might not be a big issue, but if you intend to to other smithing as well, it certainly something to take note of."
Bladesmith,2yxhpd,Bootsypants,2,Fri Mar 13 18:34:34 2015 UTC,It sounds like your friend might have an older one.  For a while they were selling Russian cast steel anvils and it was not a bad tool for the price.  Now they are exclusively selling grey cast iron lumps.

They ring like a son-of a bitch even with chain around the base, though it helps. I had to do some grinding on the horn to make it round and useable. I have had the face dent on occasion but that was a combo of poor striking and or working the steel too cold."

Bladesmith,2yt2yb,Erchi,1 point,Thu Mar 12 16:18:38 2015 UTC,Well looking up the hardness it's right with teak and Cocobolo. So it should behave similarly when drilled. As far as aging with out harding the wood it will obviously be porous to some degree and possibly dent or scratch when dropped or abused. A simple remedy for this would to be vacuum chamber the wood with some resin and oven cure it. That would alleviate all possible drilling and future aging issues. Also the oil or the pollen are know to affect allergies however cured dried wood should not pose any problems.

Bladesmith,2ym6n7,Fargraven,2,Wed Mar 11 00:02:20 2015 UTC,"Induction heating:       Induction heating is the process of heating an electrically conducting object (usually a metal) by electromagnetic induction, where eddy currents (also called Foucault currents) are generated within the metal and resistance leads to Joule heating of the metal. An induction heater (for any process) consists of an electromagnet, through which a high-frequency alternating current (AC) is passed. Heat may also be generated by magnetic hysteresis losses in materials that have significant relative permeability. The frequency of AC used depends on the object size, material type, coupling (between the work coil and the object to be heated) and the penetration depth.

Bladesmith,2ygx4z,thesirenlady,2,Tue Mar 10 01:07:11 2015 UTC,"Ric definitely knows his stuff but this was also theatrical. Ric made multiple swords for the documentary, this is likely not the finished Ulfberht that we end up seeing. If the blade is still hot enough to ignite the residual oil on the sword after he removes it from the quench then it was not quenched long enough and would not have been hardened properly. Probably not ruined though, unless overheated, but the sword would have to be normalized and then heat treated again and quenched properly."
Bladesmith,2ygx4z,shrikezulu,5,Tue Mar 10 01:21:24 2015 UTC,"If the blade is still hot enough to ignite the residual oil on the sword after he removes it from the quench then it was not quenched long enough and would not have Ben hardened properly.    You think so? can you really compare the quenching of a sword where the final target hardness is 50RC +- 4, to a knife where you're going for the most hardness you can get?"
Bladesmith,2ygx4z,FJ1906,5,Tue Mar 10 02:14:07 2015 UTC,"This is not so.  He quenched the blade for about 10 or 11 seconds, which is more than enough to harden the blade.  Simple steels need to be cooled from the Curie Point to below ~800 degree F in about 1 second in order to miss the nose of the cooling curve and get properly hard. Most oils combust below 400 degrees F(canola at 400), so if he pulls the steel at when it is below 800 and above 400, then the oil will ignite."

I've tempered steel tools before with motor oil and a secondary temper with borax IIRC."
Bladesmith,2ygx4z,Fargraven,2,Mon Mar 9 23:03:15 2015 UTC,"The optimal quenchant depends on the type of steel. Some steels use water, some oil, some even just air."
Bladesmith,2ygx4z,shrikezulu,2,Tue Mar 10 01:22:59 2015 UTC,Optimal quenchant also depends on the thickness of the steel.  Water quench on thin pieces of w2 is generally deprecated in favor of fast oils :(

Bladesmith,2ygx4z,whitefang999,1 point,Tue Mar 10 00:13:39 2015 UTC,"He's using oil, most likely mineral oil or canola if he is sticking to traditional methods.  Since the flash point of oil is much lower than the steel it is cooling, it ignites when quenched and the the oil on the blade reignites when he takes it out.  I have this happen with knives quite often.  Motor oil is a bad idea.  Every time you quench it, you are combusting it, and the fumes can be quite harmful.  Go buy a gallon of canola oil.  It is the fastest oil amongst natural oils."

Bladesmith,2yfubb,Antoak,2,Mon Mar 9 18:52:02 2015 UTC,"Nope, just stabilized with acrylic before assembly and polished."
Bladesmith,2yfubb,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:49:07 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't staining before assembly/pinning prevent that? Shape, disassemble, stain, reassemble, pin?"
Bladesmith,2yfubb,Audidrift,1 point,Mon Mar 9 19:07:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but depends on what process you're using I suppose. I was making a hidden tang so I'm not really sure how you'd hold it all together without glue. I didn't use pins."
Bladesmith,2yfubb,Audidrift,1 point,Mon Mar 9 19:39:47 2015 UTC,Looks great!  Forged or stock removal?  and How do you secure the end cap?
Bladesmith,2yfubb,Audidrift,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:50:25 2015 UTC,CPM steel comes in sheets so these are mostly stock removal with some forging of the tangs.
Bladesmith,2yfubb,steest,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:49:54 2015 UTC,Most likely? Isn't this the OP answering my question? I was assuming you made the knives
Bladesmith,2yg6v2,hartk1213,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:30:51 2015 UTC,I wouldnt trust those. Morakniv and Helle make blanks that are known to be quality and  i believe Kellam does as well. There's a vendor on ebay named twofingerknife that looks to have some nice blanks if their information is correct on their listings.
Bladesmith,2yg6v2,thezep,1 point,Mon Mar 9 16:28:48 2015 UTC,ok cool thanks for the info...just curious why would the ones i linked not be a good idea?
Bladesmith,2yg6v2,thezep,1 point,Mon Mar 9 17:09:40 2015 UTC,"Pakastani made blanks are notorious for low quality.

Bladesmith,2yg6v2,thesirenlady,1 point,Mon Mar 9 17:19:43 2015 UTC,"My first knife was a kit from http://www.thompsonsknives.com. It turned out really well and didn't require any metal work. I highly recommend them. I think Texas Knife Supply has kits, too."
Bladesmith,2yhhi7,mrwho9,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:21:30 2015 UTC,"Your steel pipe idea won't work.  In order to get the steel hot enough in there, you need some kind of insulation, otherwise you will just bleed heat and it will never get very hot.  Not to mention you will be using a ton of fuel to do it. I would suggest making a small coffee can forge with some insulation, then use a torch to heat it up.  Fairly easy to do.  Alternatively, built a pit forge.  You can use charcoal for it, and that will get it plenty hot enough to get the steel softer.  A true anneal you will never get without a heat treat oven."
Bladesmith,2yhhi7,shrikezulu,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:21:06 2015 UTC,"Mind you, make sure you are using proper insulation and it has been coated with a refractory..."
Bladesmith,2yhhi7,shrikezulu,0,Tue Mar 10 02:21:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info man, I just got the exact advice from a random metalworker at my watering hole.  He suggested Vermiculite as an insulator around Tue pipe. He also mentioned fire bricks to be an excellent and time tested choice.  As I sat there grinding and cutting and thinking, 'cause I needed to make something; I realized the  heat loss would be shit. No way to evenly heat the steel with any of our torches in a tube. It was a novel idea.  Depending on  Vermiculite cost, I may weld  a piece on the end of the tube, maybe one end piece with a slot to insert the blade. Or maybe just 'doors that slide onto legs on one send.  These machinists kept buying me strong beer so I'm rambling.  If Vermiculite is pricey, I may just buy fire bricks, I'm just bone broke for a couple months. Getting creative with the beautiful workspace I've got.  I've got all the potential to mhake a lot of shit. Literal metric fuck-tons of scrap to work with. A few old thick cast iron woodheat stoves.  Bleh. These old machinsits hold their beer better than I. Coffee can, or coffee can adjacent sounds good. Or maybe just a pit forge in the perfect hard rock/clay out back. Thanks for the input, I'll respond more coherently in the morning."
Bladesmith,2yhhi7,shrikezulu,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:11:58 2015 UTC,"It was coherent enough, no worries.   The firebrick thing is what most people do that are doing stock removal when heat treating knives.  It can be done using two bricks and the torch and it works well enough.  For your heat treating, you may need to send the blade away for heat treat.  You need to be pretty exacting on your temps, and a two brick torch forge isn't going to cut it for the length of the sword you want to make.  Your metalworking friends may be able to help as well.  Ask around and see if any of them have a heat treat oven at work and if they would be able to help out.  For your annealing, I would suggest the pit forge.  Its easy to build, and just requires charcoal and a hairdryer, both of which are relatively cheap to get. You can get a bucket of vermiculite or some ash and heat the blade up as evenly as you can, and stick it in the vermiculite/ash and let it cool overnight.  That will let it cool off slowly, which while not a perfect anneal, will be close enough to be able to work it with files and grinders without wearing them out quickly.  Once it is soft, you will certainly know the difference when working it.  Hardened steel is a bitch and can skate files all day long."
Bladesmith,2ydtyu,steest,2,Sun Mar 8 23:17:47 2015 UTC,"I've looked into doing the same, and with a 240v element you can do as large as you like; they make jewelry kilns that are about as small as you mention so that's definitely doable as well, even at 120v. What depth are you talking about here? The only thing I can imagine being a problem with a small kiln is whether or not you can cram an entire heating element in there, as shortening a pre-cut kanthal element will change its resistance and therefore potentially its heating characteristics and the voltage you have to run it at. If you can coil the whole element up and fit it in the kiln, no problem--or if you're doing your own electrical calculations, that's also fine, if more involved."
Bladesmith,2ydtyu,GarrinKnifeworks,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:53:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have the element part figured out, I am just worried if the blades are within an inch of an element would it would throw off heat treat?"
Bladesmith,2ydtyu,GarrinKnifeworks,1 point,Mon Mar 9 08:00:05 2015 UTC,"Not really for annealing/normalizing/hardening heats, but maybe for tempering if you plan on using your oven for that too. If you were worried, you could put the blade inside a stainless steel (or copper, if only at low heat) tube, which will reduce the risk of radiant or convectional heat spikes on the blade. If you're just making knives though I'd use a toaster oven and keep the heavy-duty one for hardening. I use a coal forge for hardening and it works just fine despite the imprecise temperature control."
Bladesmith,2ydtyu,thesirenlady,1 point,Mon Mar 9 22:56:12 2015 UTC,Ok I will probably hit up craigslist for the tempering oven when it comes time.
Bladesmith,2ydtyu,-cut-here-,2,Wed Mar 11 07:22:10 2015 UTC,Tempering or heat treating?  IMO making an oven to fit one blade is a bit silly.  pretty much all the same time and effort for a minor bit of materials saving and a terrible cut back on functionality.
Bladesmith,2ydtyu,beaster456,1 point,Mon Mar 9 07:37:41 2015 UTC,I have similar questions. I just found out my brother has a kiln he was using for glass blowing and thought I could use it on blades.

Bladesmith,2ycyvd,Ilovesharpobjects,1 point,Sun Mar 8 18:58:44 2015 UTC,"i've never used this one in particular, so bear with me, is the hardware for the handle rivets or screws. if they're screws you'll probably have to overcome some sort of lock-tite, difficult but not impossible. if they're rivets (im guessing more likely) you'll have to drill them out and use new hardware, i'd suggest some sort of chicago screw or other type of screw-together rivet, again, with lock-tite. but of course, your preference."
Bladesmith,2ycyvd,free_will_is_arson,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:54:42 2015 UTC,"Dont bother trying to save the hardware, there are plenty of alternatives around and cheap enough to not worry about just drill them out. Micarta is a good choice it will still give you plenty of grip if you dont polish it just sand till you like its finish, up to around 400grit seems to be a good compromise on grip and finish. Use rasps or a dremel for the rough shaping, but make sure you use a respirator or at the very least some sort of dust mask but preferably a respirator"

Bladesmith,2ycyvd,jp3592,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:14:22 2015 UTC,I have several of the brand you are talking about I get them from work. Just scrap the pins they have already been peened.
Bladesmith,2ycllu,bathsaltzombie420,4,Sun Mar 8 17:02:43 2015 UTC,"3 things.  1) that's a long time for the blade to come up to heat. I could imagine you are getting crystal growth during that time.  2) are you plunging the blade straight down in the quench medium? If the blade is at an angle one side will hit the quench sooner and cool sooner, resulting in a bend. I try to get the whole blade in the quench as quickly as possible!  3) did you normalize? I'm guessing with your setup that you are not normalizing (that is bringing the blade up to non-magnetic and then letting it cool). This process releases stress in the blade that can cause warping or cracking during quench. In terms of what it does to the blade, it breaks down large grains that can cause irregularities in the steel. I normalize three times before I quench.  I feel like the kiln is working against you. All that time soaking up heat is not what you want."
Bladesmith,2ycllu,art_and_science,1 point,Sun Mar 8 17:21:18 2015 UTC,Thanks! I was thinking that the long soak was part of the issue. What if i get the kiln to temp then put the knife in as to reduce the time in the kiln?  Edit-spelling
Bladesmith,2ycllu,A-Grey-World,1 point,Sun Mar 8 17:28:03 2015 UTC,"That sounds sensible. You really want to control your soak time. 1084 doesn't require any, I believe, unlike say O1 which needs 15/20min. Not sure what slowly ramping up the temperature is doing to the metal though, what does the cross section of the break look like?"
Bladesmith,2ycllu,RDalman,1 point,Sun Mar 8 18:14:52 2015 UTC,dont have a cam that can get a good enough pic of the break edge. It doesnt look much diff from a file i broke and was hardened by the factory it came from.
Bladesmith,2ycllu,RDalman,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:57:22 2015 UTC,What steel? Even 1095 can be quenched in oil. Look into that. How thin is your edge pre HT?
Bladesmith,2ycllu,thunderbolt777,1 point,Sun Mar 8 17:05:39 2015 UTC,It was an old file. Not sure the steel. I tried canola oil at first but it didn't quench fast enough so I switched to water as per the advice of some redditors and others. The edge was down to 30 thou. Thin but not super thin.
Bladesmith,2yb0y3,Benassi,3,Sun Mar 8 03:44:15 2015 UTC,Nice! 1095 is so cheap it invites for experiments. Still a great steel. Hope they stay straight :)

Bladesmith,2yb0y3,bobgengeskahn,1 point,Sun Mar 8 21:59:05 2015 UTC,I just have a thing for Carbon steels. Are their prices any different between metals?
Bladesmith,2yb0y3,mattmclean,2,Sun Mar 8 22:02:41 2015 UTC,"Nope Peter's does a flat rate type deal no matter the metal. They only charge more for longer pieces like swords, and give discounts on large quantities of blades. You can tell them the desired HRC, they have caps for some steels (61hrc max for 5160 for example), and their recipes are top notch."
Bladesmith,2yapml,Aniquin,1 point,Sun Mar 8 01:46:51 2015 UTC,"Good job on building a knife, but I'm confused here. Is this made from 1095 or a lawnmower blade?"

Bladesmith,2ybfs5,Kenneth_F_Powers,1 point,Sun Mar 8 06:45:13 2015 UTC,I leave them rough ground all over and finish post HT. I do this because I like to do thin grinds so just beveling post HT doesn't work for me. If that isn't the case for you you can practically finish the blade and just put the cutting bevel post HT.  I use regular HSS drills that I sharpen on the grinder. It's easier than you might think. Look up on youtube.  Handle materials pick what you like the look of. I like stabilized woods.
Bladesmith,2ybfs5,RDalman,1 point,Sun Mar 8 10:21:03 2015 UTC,Every steel works as long you outsource HT. So pick what you want there :)

Bladesmith,2yaa61,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Sun Mar 8 00:08:32 2015 UTC,Prices look great if the shipping is free.  O-1 is a fantastic knife steel and easier to heat treat than some steels.  I would just grab a few pieces big enough to make the knives you're interested in making.  Sometimes it's good to buy a piece that's a little wider than the knife blade just because the edges can be bent by whatever they cut steel blanks with.

Bladesmith,2y31u9,thezep,1 point,Fri Mar 6 04:05:04 2015 UTC,Thank you. So it basically takes two to three weeks. That's okay for me!
Bladesmith,2y31u9,perfunctificus,2,Fri Mar 6 04:17:31 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Peters over TKS.  I had a batch of two knives come back from TKS pretty warped, which can happen but these were pretty thick. More importantly, right smack in the middle of the blade surface on both blades, there was a pair of nice deep tong marks.  Who doesn't pick up the blade by the tang?  Brad at Peters is a wizard, I've intentionally pushed my luck grinding thin pre-HT, and they all come back perfect.  Plus he hardness tests every blade."

Bladesmith,2y2vsl,wkirbys,2,Wed Mar 11 23:38:18 2015 UTC,"wouldnt this type of jig create uneven bevels aling the knife (higher angles in back and thinner towards the tip)?   Yes, on smaller knives it's not a problem but on larger knives you can adjust the jig height or re clamp the blade so the portion you are working on is centered and 90 degrees square to the file."
Bladesmith,2y2vsl,Triingtoohard,2,Fri Mar 6 09:51:54 2015 UTC,"I just picked up the ""hobby"" myself as well, and I got that anvil and I love it. Great price for all I need to hammer on a piece of metal til it looks like a knife.  Other necessary items are a hammer and tongs (got some from centaurforge.com, gstongs.com, and blacksmithsdepot.com, although I use vice grips sometimes too), propane torch (big box store) and a refractory brick to make a forge (local clay crafts store). Oh, last (but most important) thing is some steel... I got a leafspring from a local leafspring repair shop, that's gonna last me a long while and make a good few knives. You can also source some steel at hightemptools.com. I haven't used that jig yet, but I am planning to make one. If you're filing a really big knife you may have to move it to prevent uneven filing, but I'm not sure. You'll be able to tell by the pattern it makes as you file, as it starts to clean up the forging marks."

That way you don't have to guess. Just scale it so it looks right and you have an exact blade profile and dimensions for the handle.  As for making it I can't see any part of it that isn't simple to make, there is just a lot of hours in it. Other than basic knife making tools, sanding drums to shape the heart are the only things you would need."

I guestimate the Blade is 10"" long with the heart centered at 5"". The tip tapers at 3""and the handle adding 6"".   Use 2""x1/8""x16"" stock and grind/cut to profile. Grind your bevels Use the drill and cut method to rough out the shape of the heart, then sand smooth. Cut the top and bottom plates to fit the tang. Use washers and black plastic for the rest of the handle and sand to shape.   Good luck."

Bladesmith,2xqflb,zoidbergin,2,Tue Mar 3 01:01:38 2015 UTC,"You can get a vice cheaper than $50, flee markets are probably a good place to look, just make some it's in okay condition.  As for the files, 1 decent file is far more useful than 12 cheap ones. Cheap files are just a waste of time, I have heard people say they wear out fast, my experience is they barely work in the first place. If you're planning on using a filing jig I would say go for a double cut second cut hand file and at least 10"" in length, longer doesn't hurt. After that buy round files and such to suit your needs."
Bladesmith,2xqflb,wkirbys,2,Tue Mar 3 01:34:50 2015 UTC,"A lot of good advice here to which I will add; take the time to invest in quality tools.  It is tempting to go down to Harbor Freight and buy a bunch of tools on the cheap, but if one were to take the time to save up and buy quality then they would find their work results are much better.  Build what you can but if you need to buy a tool, go with quality over frugality.  You will appreciate it further down the line. ;-)"
Bladesmith,2xqflb,boxingnun,2,Tue Mar 3 15:26:05 2015 UTC,"While quality tools are ideal, for someone just starting, Harbor freight is probably your best bet. I picked up a lot of essentials besides a belt sander (which I will probably save up for a better quality  2x42, seeing as I already have the essentials). I picked up a drill press, press vise, files, clamps, bits, hacksaw and blades and some sandpaper(I recommend buying better sandpaper, hf is OK but I have a few brands) for under 200.  If you're just starting, you really don't want to go drop 4-500 dollars on your starter equipment, unless you are wealthy. What if you don't like it like you thought you would ?   Harbor freight is honestly under rated. Yes, they do sell some cheap stuff, but if you know what you're looking for they do sell some decent tools.   Just my 2¢. Go to Harbor freight first and get your starter gear. Once you have the essentials so you can start making knives,  you can start saving up for better equipment.   Good luck!"
Bladesmith,2xqflb,Kenneth_F_Powers,2,Tue Mar 3 16:31:51 2015 UTC,"I would agree for some tools, but I have had no good experience with any of their machine tools.  Maybe good for 1-3 projects, then they turn to crap in a hurry.  I bought a drill press from them about 7 years ago and it crapped out on me within 10 work hours.  Many of my friends have had similar experiences.   I totally agree that for small things (files, clamps, bits, replacement blades, sandpaper,etc.) Harbor Freight is fine.  But for machine tools, I will save up and buy quality.  Just my opinion though."
Bladesmith,2xqflb,boxingnun,2,Tue Mar 3 18:29:11 2015 UTC,"I agree man, we're definitely on the same page. I guess it's a good thing I buy at least a 1 year warranty for all my tools there haha.  From my point of view, I just wanted to get started making knives ASAP without having to save up 300$ to get going. I'm definitely going to upgrade my drill press eventually, and like I said from here on out I'm doing what you said and saving for the quality tools.

However that little 1x30 belt sander they have, ive beat the shit out of it. That little monsters has done more than 90% of the work on my last 5 knives. Had to be running it for at least 3-4 hour intervals over a dozen times. For the money, not too bad of a machine."

I got a really nice old vise for $25 at a tool swap meet and it wasn't the old one.  If you have a tool swap in your area it's worth going to.  On CL it seems everybody thinks an old vise is worth $200.  Large Nicholson bastard file will get you going.  This one for instance.  You'll need some way to clamp it down to your bench, you can't do much with the blade clamped vertically in a vise.  A round file of some sort will be useful, but you can use a dowel and sandpaper in a pinch.  Lots of sandpaper.  You want the wet/dry stuff (not so much to use wet, but because it holds up to steel better).  Get lots of 100 grit, lots of 220, some 320, and some 600.  Watch CL like a hawk for a 2x42 Craftsman belt sander.  I got mine for $35.  $50 of belts later and you've got yourself a versatile grinder."

And the total price for all of them would indicate some pretty sketchy quality.  Nicholson files are still of decent quality and are widely available. Start with a double cut flat, smooth cut flat, bastard cut half round, a round, and maybe some chainsaw files.  That should cover just about all your needs and last a good deal longer than the <5 knives youd probably get out of the others.   and then I really need a vice but I cant find anything proper for under $50   I dont think you should expect to consistenly find 'proper' vices for under $50. I will say that what I can see for under $50 doesnt look horrible but im in Australia so no idea what it looks like in person. And I have seen some pretty awful vices online.  consider that an even halfway decent vise can give you decades of service so you will be better served by spending just that little bit more."

Bladesmith,2xqyb0,Triingtoohard,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:42:36 2015 UTC,"If working hammer and cylinder matter, yes, use revolver parts.  However, the size of most revolvers means that if the cylinder is to scale with the blade, it will only be a large knife or short sword.  The cylinder on the gunblade is way larger than any hand-fired revolver.    Easiest way to do it:  get someone to 3D print two halves of the cylinder and affix it on either side of a gunblade-shaped sword blank.  There are a few chrome paints that could actually make that look pretty good."

It would be impossible to get it hard enough to be brittle by quenching in oil, so tempering is unnecessary and will only make it softer than it already is.  I'm doubtful that it was even hardened by the oil quench, usually railroad spike steel requires a mixture of brine, soap, and surfactant (a recipe known as super quench)."

Bladesmith,2xow8p,Cajuncrawtator,4,Mon Mar 2 18:08:37 2015 UTC,I vote drill press. It is hard to substitute the precision of a drill press with other tools. A scroll saw isn't terribly useful for knifemaking and most things a bandsaw does can be replicated with hand saws and your belt sander.
Bladesmith,2xow8p,kingswee,1 point,Mon Mar 2 18:27:51 2015 UTC,Well a scroll or bandsaw could be useful for shaoing scales right? Get the basic shape going and knock the rest of it out with the belt sander.
Bladesmith,2xow8p,kingswee,1 point,Mon Mar 2 18:38:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they both can do that. However, you can do that fairly easily by hand with little difference in the end product. However, drilling accurate holes through scales and steel is much harder to do properly by hand versus doing it with a drill press."
Bladesmith,2xow8p,weps_grd_pandemonium,1 point,Mon Mar 2 18:44:36 2015 UTC,Hm. Suppose ill look into drill presses then.
Bladesmith,2xow8p,largos,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:24:37 2015 UTC,"I second drill press, you can also throw a sanding drum in it for sanding handles and getting into choils on blades etc."
Bladesmith,2xow8p,thesirenlady,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:07:14 2015 UTC,"I recommend the sanding drum assortments from mcmaster carr: http://www.mcmaster.com/#sanding-drums/=w55l2j  They are /much/ better than the HFT drums (no surprise there!) and cheaper.  McMaster Carr is also just an amazing place to know about, in general.  They're not a bad source of steel, either (I get 304 stainless from them)."
Bladesmith,2xow8p,weps_grd_pandemonium,2,Tue Mar 3 04:43:26 2015 UTC,"Drill press, 100%. Followed by bandsaw. Followed by scroll saw never.  Scroll saws are made to cut fretwork and jigsaw puzzles. Cutting the thicknesses and varieties of wood we cut is asking far too much of them. They cannot be used to cut g10 at all because the blades are so thin and soft the teeth will get be abraded off after less than an inch of cut.  Furthermore, the difference you get between a 'rough' cut on a bandsaw and a tight cut on a scroll saw makes little difference when you're sanding or filing it down to meet steel anyway. Not worth the compromise for the versatility and power of a bandsaw."

Bladesmith,2xow8p,perfunctificus,1 point,Tue Mar 3 00:30:44 2015 UTC,"Indeed, but last I checked not nearly as expensive as a band-saw.

As far as I can tell from using it, it's been every bit as good as 1080 or any other carbon steel. Really it should be very similar to 1080 as I believe they have the same or nearly same amout of carbon. It has the 2% nickel addition but other than that it's pretty similar to 1080."
Bladesmith,2xm0mf,JRTjack801,0,Mon Mar 2 06:01:01 2015 UTC,usually with 15n20 you use a high carbon (1075 to 1095) to produce Damascus patterned steel for some reason i think that 15n20 is slightly to brittle to make out of a knife completely (you could work around all of this however and make cable Damascus)

I left it in there a minute or two (can't remember).  Then I rinsed it off and sprayed it with Windex.  Next comes the secret.  I did not wipe it dry.  Wiping it dry at this point will remove a lot of the black.  Instead, I gently pressed it against a paper towel to dry it, but was careful not to wipe.  I let it sit for several hours without touching it.  After that, the black was stuck on good and proper.  Then I oiled it with Eezox."

I have used several sizes of induction furnace in the metallurgy industry. They are invaluable for doing extremely high temperature such as melting and refining silicon, or working on slag materials, etc. but they are far more expensive and complicated than a simple forge."
Bladesmith,2xagqw,carbonnanotube,2,Fri Feb 27 04:37:37 2015 UTC,"Why isn't this a common thing in knife making? It seems to be really easy.   Mostly because entry level runs about $1,500 for an appliance with a very narrow scope of use. The coils on that thing are small, you can't do much else besides medium-large blade heat treating. You could set up a much more multi-purpose electric kiln or a gas/coal forge for much much less."
Bladesmith,2xagqw,Antoak,3,Fri Feb 27 05:23:35 2015 UTC,"Seems REALLY prone to overheating the blade, cooking the outside while not getting the insides up to the right temps. A good electric kiln will do better just due to temperature control.   Though, this would be an amazing tool for blacksmiths and people who actually forge their blade. No soaking time in the furnace between hammerings."

Considering the melting point of Iron is 2,800 F getting to that temp isn't something you can do unless you have constructed or own a heavier duty furnace. Also I feel like melting the steel may effect the carbon content in it. I wouldn't recommend welding them together unless you plan on doing some forge welding. My concern with would be that no matter how good your welds there may be some structural problems which may cause trouble latter when heat treating and quenching. So in all I feel like forge welding may be your best bet and plus you may be able to get a Damascus look if you really go at it and fold the metal over several or so times.

Every piece of metal has a different reactance and that screws with the temperature control.   For precision you want something with a lot of thermal mass, I.e. a large bit of refractory, and something with precise temperature measurement, so contact thermocouples (which you cannot use with induction heating)."

Bladesmith,2x1j6p,new-Baltimoreon,1 point,Wed Feb 25 03:47:10 2015 UTC,"They were made of elmax. If you have access to a machine shop then you might have use of a surface grinder. very easy to match thicknesses with one of those.  although peoples definition of what constitutes a 'machine shop' do vary lol.  Blade outline is very easy. so long as the blade is flat(remove thumbstuds) you can just hold it down to the steel and trace with a scribe. IMO you'll want to do this to transfer your pivot and detent holes anyway, just run your drill through them, you wont hurt hardened steel."

We've got some kind of CMM (coordinate measuring machine), which I was thinking about using to plot out the holes for the thumb studs, or thumb hole, pivots, and detent hole. I'd like to hold as close as I can to the original so that it operates like stock, as far as feel, lockup, and lack of blade play.  Thanks for the tips.

Another reason not to use 1095 is that without a belt grinder it's very difficult to remove metal on hardened steel. Files don't touch it and 1095 can't be too thin prior to heat treat or it will warp.  As for carbon steel maintenance you pretty much have to wipe the blade clean and dry it as soon as you stop using it. Even 15 minutes on a damp chopping board is a problem.  Given your mom id of thought stainless would be better. something like 440C, CPM154 or AEB-L."

To reinforce what /u/wkirbys said, if using vaccuum heat treating a stainless knife can be more or less finished before being sending off and merely repolished with the final grit when you get it back."

Bladesmith,2wqdeq,f7a12,1 point,Fri Feb 27 03:32:35 2015 UTC,I'm shocked at how much effect you get so quickly. I will look into it some more. Thanks!
Bladesmith,2wqdeq,f7a12,1 point,Fri Feb 27 03:37:27 2015 UTC,Carbon steels like 01 and 1095 get dark very quickly. Stainless you have to let sit for maybe 30 min in the ferric chloride. It's all about gentle consistent tumbling for me and no wild shaking or putting a canister in a clothes dryer which some people do. I think plain rounded river rocks are a pretty aggressive abrasive but the finish comes out very soft to the touch.

Bladesmith,2wqdeq,jamaico1,1 point,Sun Feb 22 07:11:46 2015 UTC,"No, thats alright.  Did you counterbore the handles so the the bolts would be below the surface?"
Bladesmith,2wqdeq,fixed_1978,1 point,Sun Feb 22 07:17:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, had too. Steel is close to .2"" thick plus the scale thickness. I don't have a great drill press so counter boring is a pain. Probably easier to pin and glue up the handles but I wanted to experiment with removable ones."
Bladesmith,2wqdeq,rossbircham,2,Sun Feb 22 07:24:24 2015 UTC,"Yea, I can imagine.  The reason I ask is because the counterbore on the black and green scale knife looks rather deep, but it's hard to tell with only 1 angle, and if you counterbored too much, I would be worried about cracking the scales as you tightened the bolts down.    It might have been easier to pin and glue them, but I think the look you get from these bolts looks so much better.  Great work!"

Bladesmith,2ws2lg,Fargraven,1 point,Sun Feb 22 20:00:40 2015 UTC,"Well if you're blade is already balanced before drilling, then you'd have to remove an equal amount of metal from the blade and the handle."

Bladesmith,2ws2lg,Benman415,1 point,Mon Feb 23 02:39:34 2015 UTC,"The quality of balance is often misunderstood and overrated.  Think of the way that certain knives are used. A chopper and kitchen knife are used in a repetitive motion, up down up down. a fighter knife needs to be nimble to work around a guard or restrike after a failed maneuver. These motions involve the arresting of momentum and reversal of motion. They are often reliant on manipulation of the wrist, where balance comes into play.  Small knives are rarely used in the same capacity. Carving, skinning, making fuzz sticks, cutting cord etc, none of these actions benefit much from a perfect balance. In this case overall weight is of greater benefit."
Bladesmith,2ws2lg,free_will_is_arson,1 point,Sun Feb 22 23:57:46 2015 UTC,"TL:DR if cutting with force, weight forward. if stabbing with force, weight back. any other application, makes no difference."
Bladesmith,2ws2lg,thesirenlady,1 point,Fri Feb 27 04:10:23 2015 UTC,That is not the main purpose of those holes. Yes they are there for weight but the main reason is to allow epoxy to flow between and establish a better bond between the scales.

Bladesmith,2wsvbe,free_will_is_arson,1 point,Fri Feb 27 03:43:06 2015 UTC,This is still a nice nice I love the two tone on the handle. The only problem I see is is how blocky the handle looks get you some emory cloth on a roll and use it in a shoe shine cloth motion it will give you pretty consistent curves.

Bladesmith,2wq9tt,MileHighMontana,1 point,Sun Feb 22 04:13:28 2015 UTC,"1080 or maybe 1084 I think would be a good start. It's strong but can still be cut and shaped without a problem with the right tools.   For heat treating, you can definitely do it yourself. For your first blade that I assume you won't be selling, in my opinion, sending it out to be professionally tempered is just a waste of money. And most importantly, you won't learn anything. I don't know the exact hardening/tempering temperatures for 1080 or 1084 off the top of my head, but it's online somewhere.   You shouldn't have to worry about corrosion too bad. Plain carbon steels are known to have a somewhat low corrosion resistance. However, you can significantly slowdown rusting by sanding the blade with increasingly higher grit sandpaper. Basically, the smoother the blade is, there will be less places for rust to begin forming."
Bladesmith,2wq9tt,Fargraven,1 point,Sun Feb 22 04:58:12 2015 UTC,"You can temper in your oven, but to heat treat you'll have to build a soup can or two-brick forge to get the temperature of 1084 into the 1500 degree range. Good video here on heat treating 01 steel, similar method for 1084."
Bladesmith,2wnuu1,-cut-here-,7,Sat Feb 21 15:40:55 2015 UTC,"This shows the whole process of my first blade, made from a saw blade. I learned a LOT. At the time, I didn't know anything about different types of steel (or that most modern saw blades are garbage), proper hardening, beveling, sharpening, or handle material. But I was happy with it. It made a half decent knife for cutting pears! I made it about 8-9 months ago.   If you saw my post a few days ago, I replaced the handle with bloodwood and fixed the pins. Made it look a little better."

Unfortunately all the build pics got deleted by accident.  Blade is 1084 steel, aluminum pins, no idea what the wood is, took it from a pile of random exotic wood scales.  Made the leather sheath myself.  I had to rush the hand polishing job to get it done before I left, and unfortunately I didn't do the best job grinding the bevel so when I polished the blade the polish lines from the bevel bled onto the flats.  If anyone has any suggestions for alternatives to hand polishing, I'm all ears, by far the most tedious part.    Also, the handle kind of shrunk after 2-3 months, leaving some of the tang hanging out over the edge of the handle wood.  Any idea why this happens?  Is it water getting absorbed, meaning I have to stabilize this kind of wood?"

Bladesmith,2woz7a,bobertlo,1 point,Sun Feb 22 00:06:15 2015 UTC,Looks nice. Just my personal taste but i would end the handle slightly back before the profile drops down. That sharp angle would probably be hard to work with and fragile as shown. Thats just my opinion. Looks like a nice knife.
Bladesmith,2woz7a,free_will_is_arson,1 point,Sun Feb 22 04:25:59 2015 UTC,"blade reminds me of RAT3 a bit. the first question i always ask myself, whats the intended purpose. carving - fine as is or even drop the point a bit. hunting - up sweep the point a bit for skinning. belt/boot - extend the coil a bit more so it sits more securely in your hand. neck - looks good as is.  agree with other statements - front pin needs repositioning & that little bit of handle on the finger groove at the hilt looks like it will be too fragile."
Bladesmith,2woeah,bbp84,3,Sat Feb 21 18:33:57 2015 UTC,What were you doing when the tip broke off?  What was the orientation of the knife with respect to the belt?  How do you mean it ruined the finish?  If you post a picture we'd have a better idea of what went wrong.  You might be using too much force.  Let the grinder do the work and apply only enough force to keep the blade on the belt.
Bladesmith,2woeah,Verrence,1 point,Sat Feb 21 20:08:03 2015 UTC,I may have been using too much force and could probably use a finer grit sandpaper. I'll try to post a pic once I'm at a computer.
Bladesmith,2woeah,Verrence,2,Sat Feb 21 20:56:48 2015 UTC,"You can use as rough a grit as you like, and I recommend it for stock removal, just try to put less force into it.  You want to be firm, but not forcing it into the belt too much.  But yeah, a picture would be great."
Bladesmith,2woeah,Audidrift,2,Sun Feb 22 02:13:37 2015 UTC,"keep the blade cool, take your time"
Bladesmith,2woeah,thezep,1 point,Sat Feb 21 19:20:36 2015 UTC,"Try to make smooth passes, don't worry about keeping everything perfectly even with the course belts you can clean up the lines with finer belts. Don't do the full grind with the course belts either because the finer belts will surprise you with how much material they can take off. When your're starting out, especially with a 1x30, making some kind of jig helps until you can get the feel of things. I use some angle iron I cut up and then drilled and tapped some to holes for an 8-32 machine screw. It doesn't have angle adjustments or anything, it's strictly to hole the piece while I'm grinding since I'm in a similar situation with my 2x42 that it runs like a bat out of hell and has very little horsepower so it's a real pain to keep things steady with my hands alone. I'll probably think of something else but it's saturday night and I'm sloshed."
Bladesmith,2wl41i,bathsaltzombie420,2,Fri Feb 20 20:47:10 2015 UTC,So first time hardening. Took the thing up to 1500f in my kiln and quenched in canola oil.

Bladesmith,2wl41i,audiocycle,2,Sat Feb 21 00:07:52 2015 UTC,"That's correct. This can be an advantage (you probably don't want to spend hours sharpening a 65Rc blade). The main reason for tempering, however, is to relieve the internal stresses in the metal."
Bladesmith,2wl41i,Antoak,1 point,Sat Feb 21 03:17:24 2015 UTC,That's what I think too.
Bladesmith,2wl41i,Antoak,1 point,Sat Feb 21 00:14:19 2015 UTC,Not wrong.
Bladesmith,2wl41i,O-sin,1 point,Sat Feb 21 02:27:48 2015 UTC,Might be the quenchant. Water or a fast oil might work better?
Bladesmith,2wl41i,Verrence,1 point,Fri Feb 20 23:50:21 2015 UTC,What is fast oil?
Bladesmith,2wl41i,Verrence,2,Sat Feb 21 00:02:02 2015 UTC,"An oil which quickly drops the temperature. Parks 50 is supposedly the gold standard for fast oils. Faster quenches make for harder steels, but put the blade at greater risk of cracking during quench."
Bladesmith,2wl41i,Verrence,2,Sat Feb 21 00:22:22 2015 UTC,"A fast oil means basically that it cools the steel faster. Shallow hardening steels (W2, 1095, etc) have less than 1 second to get past their pearlite nose on the TTT graph. Drop from 1475 degrees to below 900 degrees in 1095 steel so they require a fast quenchant. The W in W2 or W1 stands for water quenching. But with the thin sections we have in knife blades it can be too extreme of a quench. Engineered quenchants are designed with this in mind. Some steels have a longer time to get past the nose so require a slower oil. Other steels such as most high alloy stainless (ATS134, CPM S35, etc) have a long time (minutes in some cases)to get past the nose so they can be air quenched but we usually use quench plates to reduce warping."
Bladesmith,2wl41i,O-sin,1 point,Sat Feb 21 03:13:18 2015 UTC,Very good info. Thank you a bunch!
Bladesmith,2wl41i,O-sin,1 point,Sat Feb 21 03:33:13 2015 UTC,What kind of steel?
Bladesmith,2wl41i,Audidrift,1 point,Sat Feb 21 00:02:59 2015 UTC,Its a piece of an old file
Bladesmith,2wl41i,O-sin,2,Sat Feb 21 00:13:35 2015 UTC,"Well, if it's a good file it should be a simple carbon steel, so water quenching or at least a fast oil (as antoak said) is in order.  Also, it might be that the kiln said 1500 but the knife wasn't actually at that temperature.  Did you happen to magnet test it?  Did it look the right color when you took it out?"
Bladesmith,2wm0zm,paxton125,3,Sat Feb 21 01:21:51 2015 UTC,Come up with a design you like and then trace it on to some cardboard and cut it out. This will give you a rough idea of whether or not it will comfortably fit in your hand. If you get that to where it feels good then down the line you'll only need to make sure to not make the scales too bulky and you should be good to go.

Bladesmith,2whvjv,BenjaminSiers,1 point,Fri Feb 20 04:06:47 2015 UTC,"something to consider is rebar or other structural steels are much easier to work with/ have a lower workable range and whatnot. I have found with O1 that it will take me 3 to 5x the amount of strikes to get the same output. This is nice though because it will make you pay more attention to shape and symmetry. Lastly, remember that forging is a form of efficiency, where you are reforming steel so you don't have to cut away as much. That being said, your shape doesn't need to be perfect, you can work on the metal cold with files and grinders too."

Bladesmith,2wi5f1,Fargraven,3,Fri Feb 20 02:26:48 2015 UTC,"Its going to create a bur either way but creating a bur is not a problem, quite the opposite. A bur indicates that you have sharpened past the apex of the edge and its time to switch to the other side  By progressing with finer stones and less strokes, the bur should be come small enough to be removed by a strop."
Bladesmith,2wi5f1,thesirenlady,2,Fri Feb 20 02:46:16 2015 UTC,"Oh that makes sense, thanks. So is there really a difference between sharpening quickly like that and going slowly and only in one direction? I'd imagine you'd want to only sharpen quickly like that to remove more material, and slow down with a finer stone?"
Bladesmith,2wi5f1,thesirenlady,2,Fri Feb 20 02:52:39 2015 UTC,More likely to slip and scratch the blade perhaps.
Bladesmith,2wi5f1,free_will_is_arson,1 point,Fri Feb 20 04:14:46 2015 UTC,"it might also cause the visual illusion of defect, the 'grain' of the sharpened edge going in different directions and catching the light non-uniformly creating shadows of sorts making you think that there's something wrong with it.   usually that's what i do, rapidly back and forth with something courser for quick removal, than slowly and in one direction for the finishing grades. i've never used a jig though, i just do it by eye/hand."

Bladesmith,2wi5f1,TotaLibertarian,1 point,Fri Feb 20 02:28:07 2015 UTC,The way he is sharpening is in a more Japanese style of saying on one part of the blade and moving as he goes as apposed to the western style of using the entire stone and the entire edge of the knife. There really aren't any differences in results between the two but Japanese style can seem a bit easier.
Bladesmith,2wi5f1,nomerkiah,1 point,Fri Feb 20 04:38:53 2015 UTC,"I was always told to sharpen in one direction only, like you're trying to cut a thin slice off the stone."
Bladesmith,2wi5f1,nomerkiah,1 point,Fri Feb 20 13:36:07 2015 UTC,Trollsky knows what he is doing and I personnaly do the same thing to get the rough cut out (120-240-600 in your case). When you use the lansky make sure you have a bur on the other side before switching side. This is the secret to sharpening.  Keep in mind: pressure * grit = finish.   The final phase should be soft strokes in one direction (spine-edge direction). Don't forget to strop.
Bladesmith,2wfvol,madbotherfucker,3,Thu Feb 19 16:11:39 2015 UTC,"Handle looks a bit cramped, i would increase the aspect ratio.  The angle at the bottom of the handle is quite sharp, might not be that comfortable with prolonged use.  The choil is next to the plunge, normally you would want the plunge to meet it in the middle at the high point.  The bit of handle next to the riccaso is very thin and a possible weak point that could chip off.

Bladesmith,2wcpxn,yangxiaodong,5,Wed Feb 18 20:57:50 2015 UTC,"This is a copy of something I wrote a while back.   Hey guys. Long time exotic wood carpenter here, and I have seen a lot of question about the best wood for making a handle the first time. Here is how I see it.  For the first time: What we are looking for: What you want from a handle wood is a few things.  Firstly, it must be attractive. There are woods that are strong, oily and have great characteristics for handle woods, but are ugly or overly plain.  Second, it must be strong. wood's resistance to dents or dings is measured in janka rating. The number listed is the number of newtons required to force a 11.28 mill ball half way into a sample of wood. hardness is key so that the handle will remain in shape after years of use.  Third, oily. This is often overlooked as many of the high end exotic woods used are oily, but the oils in woods have several benefits. Along with slowing cracking due to drying, the oils also keep the knife sanitary. Oils in woods like rosewood or ebony actively kill foreign microbes and pathogens helping keep the handle clean.  A last characteristic is heavy. Again often overlooked, the weight of exotic woods mean they can balance out a knife while still being sleek and thin.  Now lets get to wood choices. For a first few handles, we are going to be in the resonable price range ""for exotics"" as well as workability.  Bocote. It has a beautiful figure, really unmatched by any other woods. As the contours are formed, you get another dimension of of the banding. Strong and workable.  Rosewood family. Cocobolo, indian, honduran, bolivian rosewood as well as kingwood are great handle woods. Strong, pretty, oily as they come and smell lovely. Make sure you have a mask though as the dusts from these are very toxic.  Redheart. All around a great wood. It contains an amazing depth of color, combined with great workabilty and a nice figure.  Ziricote. Nice workabilty, a nice dark color combined with a very complex figure often called spider webbing. Its hard to find in wide pieces as the tree has very little heart wood with a lot of white sap wood. THe sap wood can be incorperated, but you have to be careful so it does not overwhelm the work  Figured maple. Simply classic, its easy to work, not very heavy or hard, but certainly strong enough for average use blades.  Purpleheart. A rather common ""exotic"" wood, purple heart is a very strong and stiff wood well known for its bright purple hue. While the color can vanish right after sanding, it returns slowly, but will then begin to fade. Check the finishing section for tips to keep it bright.  Padauk. Similar to purple heart, Padauk is more workable, but it is also more toxic and its color a little more fleeting.  Woods to avoid the first time.  Ebony. Its a classic. Hard and able to take a great shine, but ebony cracks. Its so brittle its not even really a question of if it will crack, more when.  Ironwood. Dont get me wrong. Ironwood is probably the best handle wood in the world. But for a first timer in making handles, its hardness can make it to much.  Lignum vitae. See above. Often considered the hardest wood in the world, working it takes so much time and can be such a pain it is best kept till a later time.  Brazillian rosewood. While there is no working reason to avoid brazillian, the fact that it is illegal to harvest makes it a morally questionable wood. I have some that i pulled out of 90 year old furniture that was being scraped, but on the whole avoid this and the possible illegal activity that brought it to the states.  Burl woods. The heavily interlocked grain and twists mean that burl wood is hard to work evenly and has a tendency to not go where you want it to.  Snakewood. One of the prettiest woods around, its extremely high price, hardness and predisposition to cracking means it should be avoided for now.  ""note that the above woods are still great for handles, but i would advise against using them your FIRST time for the issues i listed""  When picking a wood, there are a few things you may notice. first is that many exotic woods will have bands of sap wood. Often, they are very light colored parts of the wood and quite clearly marked. There are certainly woods with very gradual shifts to sapwood, but these are more rare. In general, sapwood is avoided because it lacks the color, figure and strength of the heartwood, but i can be incorporated into the design. Be careful though, as the great contrast of dark wood and white sapwood and draw the eye away from more graceful blade shapes.  Finishing: Different woods need different finishes. It depends on both the characteristics of the wood as well as its major shortcoming. Finishes are often aimed at overcoming the major short fall.  Color: Bright colored woods like purple heart, Padauk, redheart or blood wood have to major enemies. UV light and oxygen. To keep the color longer, full UV finishes are the best choice. Something like val-spar outdoor finish gives a full protective film to guard against air as well as uv protection to help keep the color.  Texture: Some coarse textured woods are beautiful and strong, but do not take a fine enough polish and make splinter in the hand. Woods like Jatoba and wenge fall into this group. Here, a thin coating of superglue/ cyanoacrylate provides protection from splinters for the user, as well as a thin coat that can be buffed to a high finish.  Oily: woods like rosewoods or verawood have an immense amount of oil found in them naturally, and rather than applying an entire finish, i find the best method to be simply buffing the handle so the heat draws oil to the surface, giving it a nice sheen.  General: My go to finish has always been tung oil. When in doubt as to the best finish, i find the fact that I can still feel the texture of the wood to be a great benefit.  As for where to find them, If you are in LA i could help, if not you could go on ebay, find bigmikeyc1, and tell him Ben sent you. He sells great stabilized woods and I have been using him for years. Burl source also stocks many of these woods, so he is another candidate. Search around and make sure to compare prices.  I hope this helps, if you have any questions about any woods you have heard of, feel free to ask."

Bladesmith,2wcpxn,Benman415,1 point,Thu Feb 19 04:22:35 2015 UTC,"3/8's is the gold standard. Most scales are sold at that thickness. A tad thinner, around 5/16 to 1/4 saves you some money and is great when you are doing flat sided scales, when you make a lot of contours like this one I made http://imgur.com/a/2vSQy you want around 7/18 to sometimes even half an inch to give you room to work.  All this could be found out with a quick google search."

Bladesmith,2wcpxn,thesirenlady,2,Thu Feb 19 13:30:29 2015 UTC,"viable alternative to oak, because it didnt work too well with my files and sanders.   What does this mean exactly?  Oak is not a terrribly dense wood. A lot of other recomendation are going to be harder and denser, and therefore generally harder to work.  You need to specify your problem because its possibly down to technique and equipment"
Bladesmith,2wcpxn,thesirenlady,1 point,Wed Feb 18 21:06:50 2015 UTC,It took me a few hours to get a handle even slightly in shape that it could be gripped. I've heard micarta is a good material. Im using a file from harbor freight and a dremel sanding bit. Neither are working particularly well.
Bladesmith,2wcpxn,Fargraven,2,Wed Feb 18 21:13:35 2015 UTC,It took me a few hours to get a handle even slightly in shape that it could be gripped.   What thickness scales did you begin with?  If material removal is your problem its not going to be helped by switching to micarta.  What cut of file are you using? What grit sanding band?
Bladesmith,2wcpxn,Fargraven,1 point,Wed Feb 18 21:23:15 2015 UTC,no clue. Really. Its just the first things i found. I think they were 1/2 inch.
Bladesmith,2wcpxn,Fargraven,2,Wed Feb 18 21:42:25 2015 UTC,"Depending on the size of the knife, 3/8 or 1/4 are more ideal. So thats a big head start.  And if you're using a smooth file then its going to be slow going. Get a bastard cut, use a file card. If you've still got thick scales you can use a rasp. be careful at the edges because they can tear out."
Bladesmith,2wcpxn,jp3592,2,Wed Feb 18 22:15:42 2015 UTC,"alright then, thanks. That would probably help a lot."
Bladesmith,2wcpxn,jp3592,2,Wed Feb 18 22:21:04 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of different woods available. See here for a sample of some woods. They have locations across the US and I think they deliver but I'm not sure. I recommend researching the woods first though. Don't make the mistakes I've made of buying wood that's hard to get a nice finish or prone to splitting...  There's also a huge world of synthetics like G-10, micartas, inlays, etc. You can even make your own synthetic scales. You can make micartas with denim, cotton, etc, or color your own resin using store-bought pigments. There's really endless possibilities. A lot of people prefer to buy it though, because it's much cheaper. And resin can get real messy.  And also there's stone, horn, and bone.   This site has a really good overview of different materials"
Bladesmith,2wcpxn,smithingnovice1011,1 point,Wed Feb 18 21:37:24 2015 UTC,"Im planning on making my own micarta, would it work if i got the resin from a craft store and used old shitty jeans for it?"
Bladesmith,2wcpxn,TheJusticiar,1 point,Wed Feb 18 21:42:06 2015 UTC,"Hehe, I'm actually making a micarta from denim jeans for the first time right now. It should be hardened in about 23 hours from now. But yes, people have definitely done it. You can use basically any cloth.   As for resin, I've only used fiberglass resin but it should work. I've actually been thinking of trying craft resin because it dries clear, instead of a gross dark brown. Just make sure your cloth is thoroughly soaked in resin. That's very important. And don't clamp it too much, because then too much resin will squeeze out. That's what I think went wrong on my last micarta. Walter Sorrels on YouTube has a good micarta video. He shows two different methods of making them.   I really hope this one works though. I haven't had the best of luck with micartas before. I'll keep you updated on it."

Bladesmith,2w809l,whitefang999,1 point,Tue Feb 17 21:55:53 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming here, since I based the design on existing knives (the esee izula being one), that it is to separate the edge of the knife from the finger guard portion. It would seem to protect your finger from accidentally getting cut on a fully sharpened edge. Also, with the notch there, I can sharpen the blade without bunging up the edge of my whetstone.   Maybe somebody who knows more about knives can explain better..."
Bladesmith,2w809l,GeneralDisorder,3,Tue Feb 17 22:03:10 2015 UTC,With such a distinct separation from blade to handle it seems the choil is a bit unnecessary on this pattern. On the other hand it's not mine so do what you like.  I like the shape. It turned out great.

Bladesmith,2w87pk,Dr_Monkee,9,Tue Feb 17 19:57:45 2015 UTC,"Depends on how good you are at the forge.  A skilled smith will get down to pretty darn close, a less experienced one is better served leaving more room to grind.  Some grinding will always be done, if only to clean up scale and trim the edge down to size."
Bladesmith,2w87pk,GrinderMonkey,5,Tue Feb 17 20:04:34 2015 UTC,"Well i just built my forge and im picking up my anvil this weekend.  Ive never worked with metal before.  So as fresh as they come.  I was wondering what type of metal is best to start with, and any advice regarding hammering out the blade."
Bladesmith,2w87pk,GrinderMonkey,5,Tue Feb 17 20:18:48 2015 UTC,"Pick up some basic tool or spring steel, 1095 or 5160 is a safe bet for forging.  Steel is pretty cheap, so buy extra!  Heat and work in fairly short sections. If the steel sparkles, it's too hot and carbon is burning out, if it cracks or becomes hard under the hammer it's probably too cool. Mind the corners of the face of your hammer as so not to leave large divots, and remember that the face of the anvil does nearly as much work as the hammer.  Edit:  Also, be safe.  Protective equipment is a must.  A heavy pair of welding gloves, a leather apron, steel toe boots, and eye and ear protection are about the minimum I would recommend for a beginner."
Bladesmith,2w87pk,whitefang999,3,Tue Feb 17 20:28:13 2015 UTC,"Look at all these monkeys!  /u/GrinderMonkey mentioned minding the corners of your hammer and the use of the anvil as a tool. As a very recent beginner myself, allow me to attest to the fact that hammer control makes a huge difference in the ease of your knife making. It's tempting to smack it for all you're worth, especially when drawing out something thick like a RR spike into a blade, but it's not worth the trouble the loss of control will cause.   To avoid this entire problem, many folks use the ""stock removal"" method, where you buy steel of a given thickness and then use exclusively saws and grinders to cut your shape and bevels. Skips the whole forging process, which I think is the most fun! That said, stock removal knives are a little easier to get exactly what you want out of them."
Bladesmith,2w87pk,Fargraven,3,Tue Feb 17 20:51:50 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you're capable of doing and the shape of your stock. You can get the general shape of your knife, the half tang (or even a full tang, depending on you're experience and its simplicity), and a rough bevel by hammering the edges. It's certainly possible to only use a grinder for cleaning up scale and maybe getting a finer edge."
Bladesmith,2w87pk,anviltodrum,2,Tue Feb 17 21:08:11 2015 UTC,"You might want to try this kind of thing to get something functional without the major grinding and fitting and stuff.  Make sure you heat treat it. After, you can tie/nail some kind of sheath around it and done."

Bladesmith,2w87pk,CrazytownUSA00,2,Wed Feb 18 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"the quick and dirty way is to use warm used motor oil in a metal bucket/can - heat the knife till the edge is non-magnetic and quench whole thing before it has a chance to cool below non-magnetic, then stone the black off and slowly heat the whole knife till the edge is brown/blue (if gray then start over - if red hot you done buggered up) then quench in water"
Bladesmith,2w87pk,verdatum,1 point,Wed Feb 18 19:47:59 2015 UTC,"i always liked to use 3/4"" (19mm) round bar and forge a rough outline with everything being about 1/16"" (1.5mm) oversize."
Bladesmith,2w87pk,free_will_is_arson,1 point,Wed Feb 18 22:49:51 2015 UTC,"I stalked you over here from /r/blacksmith, but I felt it was more appropriate to mention this here:  If you wish to make a knife, technically, you don't need to forge it (hammer it) at all.  There is a technique generally referred to as ""stock removal"" where you just start with a piece of bar stock, cut out the basic shape with a hack-saw or a cutting torch, and then refine the shape and form the bevel (and bolster, and tang) by just grinding/filing the thing down to the desired shape.  You might need a small amount of hammering after the heat treatment, due to warping, but by nature, that is done cold.  There's often a little bit more grinding after that and then you go through the honing process.  Hammering out the basic shape instead of grinding it away saves a small amount of money on materials costs.  With skill, it also generally saves a decent amount of time.  Finally, the forging process adds an amount of strength because forging manipulates the microscopic grain structure of the metal, but for something like a knife, that rarely matters.  It doesn't improve the ability to hold an edge, and knives generally don't get much stress anywhere except on the cutting edge.  If you are loathed to suffer through the difficulty of learning beginning forging techniques making tongs and such, and just want to create a knife, this might be the way to start.  If you are just pulling the piece out of the fire before quenching, and you don't plan to strike glowing hot metal with a hammer, then a good pair a vice-grips are perfectly acceptable."

Here's some before pictures:  This one, my first knife, I just used stain on the handle, and the pins didn't line up properly on the opposite side. And I did a poor job shaping the handle.

""How To Break In a Blade Select the proper band speed for the material to be cut (see charts on page 17 and 20).  Reduce the feed force/rate to achieve a cutting rate 20% to 50% of normal (soft materials require a larger feed rate reduction than harder materials).   Begin the first cut at the reduced rate. Make sure the teeth are forming a chip. Small adjustments to the band  speed may be made in the event of excessive noise/vibration.  During the first cut, increase feed rate/force slightly once  the blade fully enters the workpiece.  With each following cut, gradually increase feed rate/force until normal cutting rate is reached."""

Bladesmith,2vumn2,cambootyslam,8,Sat Feb 14 06:08:52 2015 UTC,"Micarta and G10 are a similar concept.  A flexible substrate bonded by resin.  Micarta is composed of layered fabric or paper and bonded with phenolic resin  G10 is composed of fibreglass bonded with epoxy resin.  I personally dont think they share that many similarities.  Micarta is relatively easily worked with woodworking tools. It can be cut with a plain saw, routered, and filed.  G10 does not behave the same way. It is very abrasive. is hard wearing on files and very hard wearing on plain saw blades. carbon blades like those on a wood bandsaw or scroll saw will have its teeth melted off from cutting g10. I have recently bought a diamond tile saw strictly for cutting g10 and it is far superior to a bi-metal bandsaw blade. And yet at the same time, it has less abrasion resistance, making it easier to sand.  Micarta needs fresh belts and abrasives or it will heat and char. You probably wont see that with hand tools but it's annoying with power tools.  Finish options are the same for both. low grit(320-400), high grit(2000, buff), sandblast. Comes down to personal preference. paper micarta generally doesnt suit a low grit finish.  Neither will need a top coat of any sort. Low grit or sandblast can be waxed or oiled in order to enhance the color for display purposes.  Some will say that micarta can soak up moisture, but this is wrong."
Bladesmith,2vumn2,thesirenlady,1 point,Sat Feb 14 08:05:35 2015 UTC,"dope. Looks like Micarta it is. Being i only have hand files and the sort,  good thing i didn't get g10. Paper vs Linen micarta?"
Bladesmith,2vumn2,thesirenlady,3,Sat Feb 14 20:42:24 2015 UTC,I'm a canvas guy myself
Bladesmith,2vumn2,jp3592,0,Sat Feb 14 22:03:37 2015 UTC,"They are pretty much the same thing. G-10 is essentially epoxy with some pigment added in to the desired color. Micarta is epoxy covering layers of material paper linen and canvas so from a strength and finish standpoint they are pretty much the same. The major difference is g10 is pretty much one solid color and micarta can be whatever color or layers of color the material that is used is. Either way pick what you like I sand to 600 and hit it with the buffer some people will say 400 some people might say 6,000 grit it just depends on the desired finish you want. I hope this help if you have anymore questions hit me up."
Bladesmith,2vumn2,jp3592,1 point,Sat Feb 14 06:27:19 2015 UTC,sweet. Cool im planning on ordering some g10 and nickel silver pins for the handles. Do you peen?
Bladesmith,2vumn2,80_Inch_Shitlord,2,Sat Feb 14 06:39:09 2015 UTC,Hell yeah I do but I epoxy first I have a weird way of doing my handles forced by me not having the most precise drill press. I start closest to the blade with whatever my first handle material is I like using at least two different kinds so I have holes drilled through my handle I glue(epoxy) the top piece on. Then I drill through handle using the hole in the steel as a guide then I drill the other top piece on and drill through the other piece of handle material that way the epoxy holds it right where I want it while I'm drilling rinse and repeat for the bottom part of the handle. I might put a couple of pieces of spacer material in too when I'm epoxying on the bottom part. After everything has been glued and drilled I use a triangle but on the drimel to taper my pin holes then I peen the pins and that's it just sand off the excess pin and finish my handles.
Bladesmith,2vumn2,jp3592,1 point,Sat Feb 14 06:50:13 2015 UTC,"G-10 is not just epoxy with pigment added. G-10 is a fiberglass composite. It's basically the same idea (Although with a different binder) as micarta. Layers of fiberglass sheets ""glued"" together by a thermosetting resin (Epoxy for G-10). The fiberglass can be differently colored and so you can make different colored layers with G-10."

Bladesmith,2vsppf,lordfairhair,3,Fri Feb 13 20:08:32 2015 UTC,"Amazing knives. I like the polish on the sheaths. I would recommend getting a set of leatherworking tools to clean up the edges a bit. I just use a basic set of 3. One scores a guided line down the edge and cleans a path for stitching, and the wheel looking one you run down the scored line and it marks where to place holes. I actually use a fine tip dremel to drill out my stitching holes because I am lazy, but whatever works right? You're knives are way nicer than any of mine, so take my advice with a grain of salt."

Bladesmith,2vuraj,Raltie,2,Sat Feb 14 07:09:37 2015 UTC,"During the medieval period, much like Europe, mainland Asian countries like China and Mongolia had plenty of iron ore to make steel. Japan, however, being a volcanic island, has relatively little iron, and since they were often on bad terms with the mainland, iron - and therefore steel - was a precious commodity.  This is why so much work went into producing samurai swords of high quality, why master swordsmiths became legendary and why swords were considered treasured heirlooms to be passed down through the centuries.   This video on making traditional samurai swords is very well done and you will gain a lot of respect for the work that went into crafting them.   Edit: Traditional Chinese and Japanese armor was mostly cloth and leather, with iron links and plates selectively sown in to protect more vulnerable areas. This made their armor much lighter, used less valuable resources and allowed soldiers better mobility with less fatigue, but also offered less protection than medieval chain or plate armor. However, by Medieval times, gunpowder had pretty much made armor obsolete, since any peasant with a hand cannon could take you out with a lucky shot."

You don't want any more than necessary because it's so much harder after heat treat.   2) Lots of opinions on this but I would err on the side of too much finishing before heat treat. The quench is less likely to warp the blade and you won't be finding deep scratches after hardening that take hard work to sand out. 320 grit is probably good enough. But oh it's painful to see it get so ugly after you've gotten it so pretty :)"

I like the over all design but if it were me in your shoes I would either make it much shallower and wider where the top wheel of the 1x30 could grind it out or take it to a machine shop to see if theu could mill it out real quick. A cheap die grinder from HF might be another option but even then it will be tricky to finish nicely."

Bladesmith,2vsku5,ZiLBeRTRoN,1 point,Sat Feb 14 09:27:10 2015 UTC,"Half inch in that stock is a big hole, and it will take a decent powered drill press. How wide is the choil? You may be able to mark the center vertically and then mark the same distance from the top horizontally and use that as a point to sstart your whole.  Work you way up in drill bit sizes to get the arch, then just use the hack saw to connect the ends of the circle, no filling required. The bits will chatter but it can be done, and it might be faster than trying to straight up drill a 1/2"" hole."
Bladesmith,2vsuvs,briman2021,1 point,Fri Feb 13 20:21:14 2015 UTC,"The heat treat is just about temperature and time, regardless of fuel source.  You don't need to use a stainless wrap unless you want to, and depending on the hardening method it may not be feasible (if you're water quenching 1050 the wrap will be counterproductive, if you're air hardening A2 it's great).  Argon is an interesting method, I've never heard about it being used in exactly this way, but no reason it couldn't be made to work."
Bladesmith,2vsuvs,Verrence,1 point,Sat Feb 14 02:55:30 2015 UTC,"So if I were to take a piece up to 1500*f should i just throw it in at room temp andclet the oven run it up?    As far as anti-scale solution and avoiding pitting, what all is needed with O1 tool steel, if anything?"
Bladesmith,2vsuvs,Verrence,1 point,Sat Feb 14 03:38:30 2015 UTC,"Look up the specifics for heat treating O1, there will be a temperature you need to get it to, then a time period you need to ""soak"" it for at that temp.  Then pull it out and quench in oil.  Nothing else is needed, you'll just have to sand it afterwards.  You shouldn't have any problems with pitting either if you heat treat properly.  Even if you wrap it you'll want to sand it down after the heat treat if you want a shiny clean look.  If you want to use a wrap you might want to look into air hardening steel like A2 .  At least one knife maker I know of (Aaron Gough) uses it and he's always happy to answer questions about his processes."
Bladesmith,2vsuvs,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Sat Feb 14 04:38:10 2015 UTC,"O-1 is fine with the 30 minutes of soak required.   Since you have an oven you just need to follow heat treatment recipes for whatever steel. Most blades are heat treated with an oven or other super controlled environment, so you're actually in the majority."
Bladesmith,2vsuvs,thesirenlady,1 point,Sat Feb 14 05:57:37 2015 UTC,"Are you doing this as a lesson? or just personal curiosity?  As /u/Verrence stated, foil wrap is mostly dependent on quench technique. And your quench technique will depend on the steel.  Carbon steels have a low austenizing temperature, short soak time and are generally oil quench and should therefore not be foil wrapped.  Stainless steels require a higher temperature, longer soak times and are generally air quench. Holding it at that temperature for that time can cause some pretty serious scale build up so stainless foil is a huge benefit.  Argon would probably not be worth the time and effort to setup"

Steel is 1095 from NJSB that was heated to non magnetic, quenched in canola oil and tempered twice for 2hrs at 200 degrees celsius. Handle is some kind of quilted eucalypt from Queensland laminated to black G10 and secured with corby bolts from Gameco. Brass secured using peened brass pins. Blackened using circuit board etcher in boiling water.  Lessons learned:   Ghetto grinding jig produced a pretty good bevel against the edge but did not produce as repeatable results when flipped. Always grind knife edge to oncoming belt.  Don't drill holes for peening close to rounded edges as it looks off and is hard to peen without glancing.  Ensure the blade remains perfectly strait after quenching. If it isn't; heat, reshape and requench. leave about 0.020 inches of edge width for grinding an edge. Don't shortcut this step using a carbide drag-through, you get crappy results. after using etcher go over the blade with lemon juice to even out the colour.   http://imgur.com/hsfmzyI  http://imgur.com/fvBpxKw  http://imgur.com/sO1aEGS  http://imgur.com/CxfZPSx  http://imgur.com/O0qsGe8  http://imgur.com/AtVXLgE  http://imgur.com/f3RMNfl  Edit: scales are Ringed Gidgee from 'The Timber Joint' gifted to me by Peter Cheal as offcuts with an order.

Bladesmith,2vpise,derrickboshane,16,Thu Feb 12 23:53:48 2015 UTC,"Pins are there to prevent shear forces which adhesives are not great for.  On a full tang knife, any bending in the blade is going to transfer down into the tang. For instance when someone flexes a fillet knife the whole blade is bending in an arc, not just the part laying on the table.  If you did this on a knife without pins the handle can arc and pry up the scales with surprising ease.  Plus I think pins look nice. I find full tang hidden pin knives to be very boring"
Bladesmith,2vpise,thesirenlady,5,Fri Feb 13 00:30:06 2015 UTC,I glue and peen my handles on if the epoxy ever fails the peened pins will still hold everything nice and tight. Would just epoxy work possibly but it takes me less than 5 mins per knife so why wouldn't I do it.
Bladesmith,2vpise,jp3592,2,Fri Feb 13 00:01:50 2015 UTC,"On my phone now so I can't find the video but I remember seeing Aaron Gough from Gough Custom testing the strength of handles under fairly extreme forces in one of his videos. If I recall he tested 3 scenarios: just epoxy,  epoxy and pins, and epoxy and Corby bolts. I believe the Corby bolts were the strongest,  followed by the pins,  and then just the epoxy in last place."
Bladesmith,2vpise,Munnjo,1 point,Fri Feb 13 02:11:59 2015 UTC,"Knives can last for 100 years if taken care of.  When you build something with that in mind a lot of people will take a ""belt and suspenders"" approach.  But I think the real reason is we've been pinning knife handles for centuries and relatively recently have come up with adhesives that are bulletproof.  So it looks funny to see a Western chefs knife with no pins.  I think we generally like the look of fasteners.  On the other side of the Pacific the Japanese have been holding handles on with just the friction of burnt wood for centuries."

I own this exact model and I can stop the belt or disk with a bare hand. It's good for some shaping of curves and whatnot, but not powerful enough for your bevel. Also, a narrower belt is better for doing bevels. Even this would be a better choice.  Edit: not an expert bladesmith, just going on what I've seen and what has worked for me."

Bladesmith,2vo53c,weps_grd_pandemonium,2,Fri Feb 13 03:36:22 2015 UTC,"You can definitely figure out some methods to make the 4x36 work, but it has some limitations.  I would say the biggest is the the edge of the belt does not come out to the edge of the platen.  This means that you cannot use it to cut a plunge.  As crappy as they are, the HF 1x30 will be more versatile.  The craftsman 2x42 is really the way to go, for not that much more money.  Remember that your belts are going to end up costing many 100s of dollars anyway in the long run, so another 100 to get the right tool to start with is negligible.  Also, www.supergrit.com, hands down best prices and selection I've seen.  Get ceramic belts. Forget aluminum oxide, that shit is poop."
Bladesmith,2vo53c,perfunctificus,2,Thu Feb 12 19:54:03 2015 UTC,Ok I feel I am qualified to answer this. I have a 1x30 and a 4x36 (non-HF but same crap). I have used both to make several knives each. I switched to the 4x36 because I was having trouble getting consistent flat bevels on big kitchen knives. Laying the blade lengthwise on the belt will get it flat. Tilt it and you have a bevel.   It's awkward to hold the blade and the platen on mine was not very flat. I flattened it and it helped some. With appropriate belts it will definitely work. The 50 grit Home Depot belts last long enough to do a chefs knife.   The Craftsman 2x42 is the way to go. You're going to spend more in belts than the machine in the long run. I invested in tons of 1x30 belts and as soon as I did a used 2x42 fell into my lap.   For smaller blades the 1x30 is actually pretty awesome and decent belts are available off amazon.

HD seems to have these for $17ish for a two pack, so i imagine it'll be cheaper for one. but it has to be the 600s. this will allow 5amps of power, which is plenty for a sander from HF, and dremels without adjustment knobs (though those will stall at a certain point) and a myriad of other power tools with less than 5amps of power draw.   note: don't try to run heavy load power tools through one of these, even if the amperage is under 5, it'll probably spike above 5a, and that's just not going to end well.  so,  in the US, white is neutral and green/bare is ground. any other color is hot.  Hot always gets attached to the side with the little slot. neutral to the side with the big slot, and ground goes to the green screw.  if you can't tell immediately which is which and you can see the screws, silver screws are neutral, brass is hot. and of course, again, ground is green.  in other countries, sorry, i don't know the slightest bit about what your electrical code is.  you can cut off the end of the extension cord (the one you plug stuff into) or cut the cord in half. one way is easier and results in a dimmed extension cord with a big box on one end and the other with a box in the middle. this is for the one on the end. see below for other.  with the female end cut off, strip roughly 4-6 inches of exterior insulation off the end of the cord (NOT THE INTERNAL CONDUCTORS!) now, most drop (extension) cords will have proper colors, but not all. so take a multimeter and test the wires if the colors aren't standard (white, black, green.)  write down which one is which for later.-- no meter? HF sells them for $3-4 fairly regularly, and once in a great while it'll be the free item du-jour. the setting you want is Ohms. which is the Omega symbol.  okay, so some dimmer knobs/sliders/switches have a neutral, and some don't. if it does, you connect all the neutals in the box together, if it doesn't, you still do (all 'whites' go together.) add a 6 inch piece of white romex to the outlet (via push-in or screw to the relevant side. newer outlets are labeled, or use the visual descriptors above.)  on the input/output side. the 'line' wire on a dimmer in the one you're going to hook to the drop cords 'hot' wire, with a wire nut. the 'load' gets connected to the hot wire of the outlet, or you may be able to get away with connecting it directly to the outlet.   rule of thumb: if the dimmer has stranded wire, use short bits of romex (6 inches) to connect it to the outlet as stranded wire doesn't like to play nice with most outlet screws, and definitely not with the push in style holes.  one ground wire from the cord, one from the outlet (6 inches of romex, the green or bare wire), and one from the dimmer (which may or may not have a ground wire. it may have a screw. if it has a screw, use another 6 inches of romex ground wire)  so, you're going to have 4 connections at the end of this.   hot in to the line on the dimmer (from the cord.) (usually black) hot out to outlet (black, red or some other random color) all neutrals together (whites) all grounds together (green/bare)  el quicky diagram  parts:   Skylark 600w dimmer with switch -- $17.97. has stranded wires with ground, no neutral 15amp decora outlet -- $2.19, labeled, screw and push-in. 15 feet of romex 14/2 -- $6.87, 2 conductor, with ground. standard stuff.  cable clamps for drop cord into one of the holes in the gang box -- ~$2 note: you only need one for this variant, and size varies on the size of gang box you get. make sure before you leave the store! -- use to clamp the cord into the box so it stays put! Wire nuts to connect it all together -- $4.98 /25, plenty, with 3 sizes. Plate to make it look pretty and to keep junk out of the box -- $1.59, need 1. 2 gang box, metal -- $5.36, need 1   total cost; roughly $41 getting everything i listed above and not hunting for better deals in store. drop cord is extra, and really variable. HF has a 25 ft for $13 in 14ga. not sure i'd want to get a longer length due to voltage drop. better safe than sorry. so for around $50 total if you have to buy a cord, max.  ~$50 for a well done DIY adapter to make most power tools variable speed/power if they don't draw more than 4-4.5 amps and aren't air compressors. seriously, don't plug compressors into these things. bad mojo.  feel free to ask any questions.  edit: left out the gangbox. oy."

Bladesmith,2vo53c,kenabi,1 point,Sat Feb 14 17:51:20 2015 UTC,WOW! GREAT info. Would all that work on a 1/2 HP Craftsman 2x42 belt sander? That's what I have right now and saving the temper while still removing material is a VERY tricky business currently. I'm debating doing a DIY water cooled setup or doing this type of thing.
Bladesmith,2vo53c,InquisitiveLion,1 point,Sat Feb 14 18:06:53 2015 UTC,"1/2 HP Craftsman 2x42   supposedly, this is also a 3.5amp motor, so yeah, it should. that being said, i have no info on whether slowing the belt down would keep your heat lower in such cases. worth a try if you want i guess.  my main thoughts were towards keeping the belt a bit slower for scale and handle shaping.  when in doubt, dip it in water."
Bladesmith,2vo53c,kenabi,1 point,Sat Feb 14 18:17:30 2015 UTC,"I've heard that having it fast really builds up heat, and it does ruin the temper pretty quickly, I may just have to do many, many quick passes after dunking in water."
Bladesmith,2vo53c,InquisitiveLion,1 point,Sat Feb 14 18:20:28 2015 UTC,1x30 and 2x42 seem more commonly used size. I had considered one like this but is the platen fixed in place? It seems like it might be difficult to make a nice plunge line as well. With a craftsman 2x42 you can remove the platen and grind with a slack belt.
Bladesmith,2vo53c,weps_grd_pandemonium,1 point,Fri Feb 13 03:41:26 2015 UTC,"The controversy over Harbor Freight belt sanders are understandable. However, since you're just starting out, it should work fine but yes, you'll eventually find yourself wanting something more versatile and powerful.  I've been using the 1x30 harbor freight belt sander for a while and it's been working alright. It gets the job done, in terms of getting a bevel and also shaping handles. But that's all I use mine for. The low power (1/3 HP) motor can't really handle too much pure stock removal or other heavy work so I just use it for light work.  I agree with /u/suckerforhentai, the 1x30 model will probably prove more versatile. It's super easy to change/adjust the belt, and there's also slack, useful for shaping handles."

Bladesmith,2vn298,WingedDefeat,1 point,Thu Feb 12 10:40:11 2015 UTC,Planning on just doing stock removal. I have been checking out Aaron Gough on YouTube. One of my biggest questions is how to pin the scales for a long lasting secure handle.
Bladesmith,2vn298,thesirenlady,2,Thu Feb 12 10:50:15 2015 UTC,One of my biggest questions is how to pin the scales for a long lasting secure handle.   Yeah Corby bolts are your solution there.  Some of his earlier vids he was peening pins but IMO peening is not a great idea  Also I second getting 1084 over O1
Bladesmith,2vn298,aarongough,1 point,Thu Feb 12 21:19:23 2015 UTC,Sounds good. Thanks for the advice. Got my steel and Corby bolts ordered.
Bladesmith,2vn298,RDalman,3,Thu Feb 12 22:13:58 2015 UTC,"Make sure to get the counter-bore drill bits for fitting the corby bolts as well!  Peened pins can and do work very well, they're just harder to do consistently which is why I switched to Corby bolts. Overall strength is about the same.  O1 is the right choice for your steel. For heat-treating you can use a charcoal BBQ, or you can build a 2 brick forge. When heat-treating make sure you're in relatively dim lighting so you can see the colors of the steel properly (don't heat-treat outdoors in the middle of the day, way too bright). The color you're after is dull cherry red... Check out my O1 heat-treating video on Youtube for more info.  If you have questions feel free to ask any time! If you mention my name like /u/aarongough on Reddit I get notified and I'll come help within a few hours."

Bladesmith,2vn298,obeythehypnotoad,2,Thu Feb 12 22:40:57 2015 UTC,1084 is usually recommended for the heat treat challenged.
Bladesmith,2vn298,aarongough,3,Thu Feb 12 14:58:45 2015 UTC,"1084 is easy to heat-treat, but I don't think it's any easier than O1 as far as I know. the main reason I recommend O1 is because it's more easily available in a wide range of sizes and is much easier to finish because you don't have to worry about mill scale and decarb. Also no need to normalize because O1 comes spheroidized annealed so the grain structure is already nice.  Precision ground & annealed 1084 would be nice!  EDIT: should say my answer is biased toward stock removal makers. Anyone who's forging doesn't care about the advantages of O1 and 1084 will be cheaper for the same result in that case."

I did my mosaic pins this way for a long time, and then I discovered another way using this method.  I'd argue that the brake bleeder is superior in every way, less air bubbles, way less mess, don't need to get new syringes every time.  I'd also recommend using slower setting epoxy, 5 minute can be a liability if things don't work out just right, I'd much rather have some time to fiddle.  I shove one end of the pin in a snug 1/4"" hole in a piece of wood while it cures, so it can sit vertically and not flow out."
Bladesmith,2vl4iz,perfunctificus,1 point,Thu Feb 12 00:42:00 2015 UTC,"This was fantastic.  After watching the OP video I thought to myself, ""Well, no way I'll be making Mosaic pins then.""

Bladesmith,2vl4iz,timbozo,2,Thu Feb 12 03:42:51 2015 UTC,"I should add, with the brake bleeder you really need to use the fully slow setting epoxy like devcon 2-ton or west systems g-flex.  It takes a good 5-10 minutes of suction to draw it up through a 12"" tube, if it is starting to become more viscous already within that time it'll never happen.  I'd also recommend using liquid colorant, as it thins the epoxy, whereas the dry stuff thickens it."

Bladesmith,2vmxua,boxingnun,1 point,Fri Feb 13 10:44:09 2015 UTC,The rescue tools are handy and should you make your own sheath knife I would suggest making a full tang blade and leave a squared up corner at the base of the handle.  That squared up corner is all you should need to bust through glass.  I would like to recommend that you consider getting a spring loaded center punch (for starting holes to be drilled in metal) for your vehicle instead.  This is what first responders I know prefer because when it is used on glass (not its originally intended purpose) it has a tendency to not send glass flying everywhere unlike a tool one would swing.  It is also not much bigger than a sharpie. ;-)
Bladesmith,2vmxua,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Feb 13 15:06:22 2015 UTC,"Automatic center punch:       An automatic center punch is a hand tool used to produce a dimple in a workpiece (for example, a piece of metal). It performs the same function as an ordinary center punch but without the need for a hammer. When pressed against the workpiece, it stores energy in a spring, eventually releasing it as an impulse that drives the punch, producing the dimple. The impulse provided to the point of the punch is quite repeatable, allowing for uniform impressions to be made.

As for a hatchet, the only way I can think of to make one without forging is to get a BIG (and fairly thick) sheet of some carbon steel and cut out the shape of the hatchet (including the handle) with a torch or angle grinder.  Then bevel the head, heat treat, and wrap the handle to make a comfortable grip.  Could be done!  Might be expensive though, unless you can find a big sheet of good steel at a scrapyard or something."
Bladesmith,2vmxua,whitefang999,1 point,Fri Feb 13 05:50:25 2015 UTC,"I will look into it. As for the hatchet, i do have a lot of tools at disposal, so that's not really a problem. Materials are my problem. I don't really have the luxury of the Steel baron, or something similar."
Bladesmith,2vmxua,whitefang999,1 point,Fri Feb 13 10:46:12 2015 UTC,"The hatchet is probably best achieved with a forge. Lacking a forge, you're in for a hell of a lot of cutting and grinding, and you'll have to buy a fairly thick chunk of steel. At least 2"" thick to accommodate a handle (the hole for which you'd have to drill), and then as tall and long as you want the head of the hatchet to be... Looking like 2""x4""x6"" - that's an expensive chunk of tool steel...  Edit: 2"" thick might be excessive, but I can't imagine anything much smaller than 1-1/4"" having enough room to drill a hole for the handle in, and still have structural integrity around the handle."
Bladesmith,2vmxua,whitefang999,1 point,Tue Feb 17 20:58:58 2015 UTC,"I was actually thinking about making a hatchet like one of those ""tactical"" ones, something like the Gerber Downrange, or similar. I think i'll go with stock removal method. My only problem is the material. I'm good with metals and fabrication, but finding smaller quantities of quality sheet steel for a knife or a bigger stock is near impossible around here. I can get sheet steel, but i have to buy a sheet 1,25 x 2 meters, which would cost me around 900$. Awesome:/"
Bladesmith,2vmxua,kenofthesea,1 point,Tue Feb 17 22:06:17 2015 UTC,I suppose if the handle and head were one piece it wouldn't need to be too thick... Have you tried online suppliers?

Then I just use steel wool and dawn dish soap to remove the scale the forge puts on and I have been leaving any de carb or surface spots just to give it character then I use the vinegar.
Bladesmith,2vlirj,nootay,2,Thu Feb 12 01:03:29 2015 UTC,I think it looks awesome. How exactly did you do a forced patina?  Does it come off when you wash it?
Bladesmith,2vlirj,jp3592,1 point,Thu Feb 12 01:59:10 2015 UTC,I heat vinegar up in the microwave almost boiling as hot as I can get it. Then I put the knife in it and come by every so often and brush it with a plastic brush or steel wool. It gets to a point where it won't get any darker then I stop. It's not super scratch resistant it's basically a form of oxidation that protects against red rust.

I'm thinking that, since blades are so thin, there wouldn't be too much difference between the core temp and the wall temps, which would be the major downfall of these markers.   Has anyone used these? I got this suggestion from a machinist who's going to university with me after talking about heat treats."
Bladesmith,2vklwc,jp3592,1 point,Wed Feb 11 20:17:52 2015 UTC,I came here to say I didn't think it would work because they don't go high enough in temperature. Then I clicked the link and was immediately proven wrong. The way we use them for welding inspection is to preheat the surface then try to draw with the stick if it melts it's hot enough which is precise enough for welding but basically what it's telling us is it's at least this hot. That could cause a problem for heat treating because say you want it 1550F and you can mark it with the temp stik it could be 2300F we don't know we just know it's at least 1550 because that's what our stick is rated at. However if there was a way to mark the steel with the stick before you started heating it might be possible to just check on it and as soon as you notice it went from chalky to melted quench it or try to maintain that temperature until your soak is done. I hope this helps it's just the first thought that came to my mind and I want to try it I just never considered trying because I didn't realize they could measure temperature that high TIL.
Bladesmith,2vklwc,jp3592,1 point,Wed Feb 11 20:40:54 2015 UTC,"yeah, 1095 steel only need 1475-1525 in Fahrenheit, so these temps do exist.   I have 2 ideas.   Use it like it is intended for, mark a few lines, then heat it. The problem I see with it is that it could just melt from the torch I'm using (plumber's/hobby propane torch in a forge) and not have any effect on the blade. Like the torch would heat that first, before the knife was up to that temp.  Heat until past magnetic (~1425) and then instead of checking with a magnet, check with the stick to get a binary yes/no answer about every minute or so. When first yes, quench.    this is the site I'm using and they say it's pretty easy with just a magnet, but I want to make sure I'm doing it properly."
Bladesmith,2vklwc,ZiLBeRTRoN,3,Wed Feb 11 20:52:52 2015 UTC,If I was going to mark first I would mark the non torch side but the swirl might get it anyway or you could use a combination of both. Try marking first if it melts from the torch flame then fall back on the magnet and and just double check with the mark after you know it's in that range.
Bladesmith,2vklwc,KAcotton,2,Wed Feb 11 21:13:32 2015 UTC,"that's exactly what I was thinking to do. Awesome, this might really help!"
Bladesmith,2vklwc,KAcotton,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:33:55 2015 UTC,"You could use one for the temp you want, and then get one a bit higher, make sure it melts for the first but not the second. That would at least give you a range instead of a minimum temp."

Bladesmith,2ve1j1,thunderbolt777,3,Tue Feb 10 07:09:29 2015 UTC,"I based it on a couple designs I had seen around on the internet. I know its overkill, but it was a lot of fun to build! And the top and bottom are solid pieces so replacing the bricks will be trivial.  I put metal grating around 4 sides and furnace cement inside to increase durability (but I couldnt reach the middle, and decided to just leave it, I was most worried about the edges.) If I did it again Id probably skip the cement.  I got some scrap mild steel very hot very evenly in around a minute so Im satisfied. I only plan on heat treating relatively smaller knives for now."

I had a hairdryer blown charcoal forge that I made for $20 but I had to get rid of it. What do you use to tell the temperature? I use a magnet to find the curie point then look for decalescence but I'd like to get a pryometer or something.

Bladesmith,2ve1j1,Ulferor,1 point,Wed Feb 11 04:42:32 2015 UTC,Magnets are pretty useful for what they are. My forge was kind of a tin can too!

Bladesmith,2ve1j1,itsrocketsurgery,1 point,Tue Feb 10 20:35:30 2015 UTC,"I bought these fire bricks on amazon and put a thin layer of furnace cement around the inside and the front face just so I wouldn't scrape away at the brick too much (it's very soft and brittle.)  The heat source is a TS8000 torch. It seems to have at least enough to power a forge of this size (the inside is 2-1/2"" in diameter.)"

Most knife making suppliers will have kits like this you wouldn't be involved in the bladesmithing part but you can still get pretty creative with the handle crafting. However if you are willing to spend several hundred bucks what /u/thesirenlady said would be a much better option it would give you a good knowledge foundation. You would get to see the process and have a good idea of what tools you would need in the future if you decided to stick with it."

A file a jig some wood couple of fire bricks and alot of sandpaper and you would have an excellent starter kit that alot of the posters on here made their first knives with and kept on using it after that for many more knives.
Bladesmith,2vbi57,perfunctificus,3,Mon Feb 9 17:39:51 2015 UTC,I love these chef's knives. What oil (I assume) do you use on the handles?
Bladesmith,2vbi57,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,3,Mon Feb 9 21:27:55 2015 UTC,"None, stabilized wood is effectively plastisized (plasticated?).  It's soaked in a polymer so the wood is fully impregnated.  All you have to do to finish it is sand to 600 or finer and then buff.  It's the way to go, and very much not cheap for nice pieces like this one.  This block was $38.  Luckily it's big enough for 3 handles, since it was wide enough to get 2 handle sections out of each slab.  Frequently the block dimensions are such that I get 3 scales (1 in thick cut resawn to 1/4, but the kerf means I only get three slabs).  So on those knives I only get one full handle, then I usually use the remainder to do one of my multi piece handles paired with some cocobolo."

Bladesmith,2vbi57,jp3592,2,Tue Feb 10 00:09:37 2015 UTC,I have recently gotten into home stabilizing for ease of finishing and I'm hoping it turns out good I haven't actually put a handle since I started but I'm being optimistic.

Bladesmith,2vci91,ntermation,3,Mon Feb 9 22:03:35 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of options when it comes to damascus(Pattern welded steel) just like steel its almost impossible to say damascus is better that carbon steel or vise versa. You can make damascus out of stainless,high carbon simple steels, complex high carbon alloys, tool steels the list goes on so to start with if the damascus is made out of good steels and heat treated properly you should end up with a good end product just like other blade steels with the same levels of treatment. To address the cost question I have looked at ordering a simple pattern damascus steel from a quality source and it was going to cost $8 and up per linear inch so if I wanted to make a 10'' knife it would cost me 80 just for the price of the steel not counting labor and other materials for a final product. So you can do the math on that to determine what you are getting as far as quality goes. As far as your technique question goes differentially hardening and tempering is very much still used today and has a good reason for being used. Its purpose is to give a softer spine and a harder edge that way you are getting the best of both worlds flexibility and good edge holding retention which would lead into a discussion about toughness(ability to flex without breaking)vs hardness(the ability hold an edge and be very abrasion resistant but at the same time it is brittle which can cause a blade to break like grass) I know I didn't give you a definitive answer  but when talking about steels so many factors come into play what is it's purpose how often will it be used what atmospheric conditions do you expect to when you will be using it."
Bladesmith,2vci91,jp3592,3,Mon Feb 9 22:30:49 2015 UTC,"Is the modern damascus steel offering any benefit over regular old high carbon steel blades? Or is it purely cosmetic?   Purely cosmetic.   Also, Ive seen some damascus steel katana online, for what seems like ridiculously cheap prices, I am assuming this is a result of modern manufacturing techniques and mass production, but Im wondering if anyone here wants lend their knowledge of bladesmithing to comment on how a damascus steel katana would potentially not be as effective as the normal differentially hardened style?   I don't think you will get a ridiculously cheap and effective katana no matter what it's made from.   I read somewhere recently, that even the differential hardening used on swords is no longer necessary, except as a purely cosmetic feature, as modern steel is far superior to the the steel used when these techniques were developed.   Differential hardening is not just a cosmetic feature. That said it might not be a necessity like it once was if using modern spring steels."
Bladesmith,2v8tr5,Benman415,2,Mon Feb 9 00:08:24 2015 UTC,Interested in constructive criticism?
Bladesmith,2v8tr5,perfunctificus,2,Mon Feb 9 05:41:04 2015 UTC,always
Bladesmith,2v8tr5,perfunctificus,2,Mon Feb 9 06:18:21 2015 UTC,"A couple easy things you can still fix on this one... your tip looks very rounded off.  This can be very difficult to avoid during sharpening. The easy fix it just to remove material from the spine on the grinder down to the tip until the rounded off bit is gone and you're left with a perfect pointy tip.  Do this very carefully and get some water on the blade as the tip will get hot quickly.  results Secondly, the profile of the blade where your index finger sits, that is the little bit that comes from the handle out to the edge, looks crude and unfinished, especially next to your nicely shaped and finished handle. You can still easily tidy up that line with hand sanding, but the quick and easy way would be a little 3/4 inch or so sanding drum.  They cost a couple bucks and you can just stick it in your drill press.  For next time, space those handle pins evenly, it will look much better.  Making sure the middle pin splits the difference is a good start, but you can also do things like space the outer pins equidistantly from the butt and bolster.  Do a little math and you'll be shocked how much your eye will pick it up.  And don't give up on the finish until it's dialed, either do your final sanding grit lengthwise or crossways, but don't stop until all previous sanding marks are gone and the finish it as even as you can get it.  It's that last bit of elbow grease that makes the difference between not-bad and beautiful.  Scotch-brite belts do a pretty nice job as well.  Once you're happy with the blade finish, masking tape the crap out of it and don't let grit or steel anywhere near it while you do your handle work.  All in all, nicely done! You're a few tweaks away from a very good looking knife."
Bladesmith,2v8tr5,Szervetlen,1 point,Mon Feb 9 08:56:31 2015 UTC,I love the shape of the blade! Really like this style.  What is the height of the blade from the heel to the spine?

If you don't have a belt sander, I'd recommend a 1x30 inch one. They're not bad and very cheap.  When forging the shape, you'll need to normalize it by bringing it to critical temperature and letting slowly cool a few times before quenching.

Bladesmith,2va7op,WingedDefeat,1 point,Mon Feb 9 13:25:57 2015 UTC,"The biggest advice I have is start with the right steel and research doing all the heat treat properly for that steel.  It could look like a work of art and if the steel isn't right, it's not a knife.  Conversely, it can be hideous but if the steel is good and the heat treat nailed, it can still be a useful and reliable tool.  Everything in between is just taking materials that aren't shaped like a knife, and making them shaped like a knife.  There are many ways to skin that cat, watch a lot of other people's methods and pick the ones that make sense to you and work with your equipment.  There's no wrong way if the results are good and you keep all your fingers."

Bladesmith,2v8r4w,madeulook1,2,Mon Feb 9 00:09:28 2015 UTC,"No comparison.  Hokey? Its a fairly standard interpretation of the 2x72 grinder model  Dangerous? In what way? we have the exact same model of grinder as the busy bee at my work, and a closed frame design like that one is way more dangerous.  we had a young guy deburring a bit of shs. It shot it down and got caught between the wheel and the frame, it also caught his hand between the shs and the wheel. Wore down to tendons before it was shut off.  The total enclosure also ensures that any little bit that goes in with the belt is going to come straight back at you.  As mentioned you have the high rate of speed, the lack of belt availablity, selection, and cost, it has a flat platen but its on top, the wheel is 8"" or so which is about minimum for hollow grinding but being 3"" wide is a hindrance not a help.

Bladesmith,2v3f0z,hinker25,3,Sat Feb 7 22:02:30 2015 UTC,"No real issues that I know of. The speed that it reaches temperature isn't too much of an issue, some steels will require a soak at a certain temp which might be a little tricky with the induction forge. They are good for general forging and heat treating. Heat treating is nice because you don't have to worry about overheating thin areas like the edge and tip. The thicker sections have more resistance therefore they get hotter than thinner sections. They are fun machines but quite expensive."
Bladesmith,2v3f0z,FJ1906,3,Sun Feb 8 04:21:21 2015 UTC,"I was watching some more videos on them, and this one explains how he made one, if anybody is looking to build one."

Bladesmith,2v3f0z,Fargraven,4,Sat Feb 7 17:39:43 2015 UTC,Theyre actually purported to be significantly cheaper to run than a propane forge. something in the area of 1/8.

Bladesmith,2v3f0z,IOwnTwoDogs,1 point,Sun Feb 8 07:29:22 2015 UTC,Probably not suitable for farrier work really. You'd have to jam a pretty sizeable generator into the back of the truck to go with it. you might spend more money on diesel than propane

Think how much energy is lost in a gas or coal forge to the refractory, air escaping, etc.  The losses in an inductive forge are tiny.  I can't imagine trying to heat treat with the one in the video, though I can't imagine heat treating with a blowtorch and people do that."

Bladesmith,2v3f0z,TheWingsAndTheSun,2,Sat Feb 7 19:05:38 2015 UTC,How??? I'm sorry for being ignorant about this really neat technology but does anyone know what the physics are here?
Bladesmith,2v3f0z,straws,4,Sun Feb 8 06:33:54 2015 UTC,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_heating
Bladesmith,2v3f0z,autowikibot,2,Sun Feb 8 06:45:25 2015 UTC,"Induction heating:       Induction heating is the process of heating an electrically conducting object (usually a metal) by electromagnetic induction, where eddy currents (also called Foucault currents) are generated within the metal and resistance leads to Joule heating of the metal. An induction heater (for any process) consists of an electromagnet, through which a high-frequency alternating current (AC) is passed. Heat may also be generated by magnetic hysteresis losses in materials that have significant relative permeability. The frequency of AC used depends on the object size, material type, coupling (between the work coil and the object to be heated) and the penetration depth.

Bladesmith,2v3f0z,straws,2,Sun Feb 8 06:49:23 2015 UTC,I am pretty alright with physics and thermodynamics and still induction heating is so weird to me.
Bladesmith,2v5kyp,dudeman7557,3,Sun Feb 8 02:39:33 2015 UTC,It can be a powder coat which can be very hard or different types of epoxy most people think of epoxy as just a glue to stick things together but there are also epoxy coatings. This is one way you could acomplish a finish like that there are many different brands that are similar each with there own properties that would benefit situations. Source I am a coating inspector by trade specialized in epoxies.
Bladesmith,2v5kyp,jp3592,2,Sun Feb 8 03:26:35 2015 UTC,"There are certain treatments for blades that can be used. Other users in the thread have mentioned things like coatings, cerakote and other blade finishes. I find these to be ineffective, and to lose their luster and clean look very quickly. Instead, for knives I make, I've been using a material called Jax which is a steel blackening chemical that was recommended to me by another user on this board. It doesn't scratch or wear away as easily as other coatings/treatments, but it's less matte than the other powder coatings."
Bladesmith,2v5kyp,UncleJehmimah,2,Sun Feb 8 04:56:56 2015 UTC,"Forced patina. Heat white vinegar to boiling, submerge cleaned blade and leave until the fine bubbles stop. Remove blade, polish, repeat until desired look is achieved.   Basically it's controlled rust. It looks black and will keep damaging rust at bay. It eventually wears off so it needs to be redone periodically."
Bladesmith,2v5kyp,MachinatioVitae,1 point,Sun Feb 8 06:20:05 2015 UTC,"The most obvious solution is paint, but I think that could easily scratch.   Almost every black blade finish scratches easily.  The exception is DLC coatings which you can't do yourself.  I'm not sure how durable those are, I've never used a blade that had DLC on it."
Bladesmith,2v5kyp,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Sun Feb 8 03:36:34 2015 UTC,"Most of those blades are ceracoated. You can do it yourself but it can be tricky to get a smooth finish. It will wear.  Forced patina can be accomplished with vinegar or even easier with Ferric Chloride (PCB Etchant). Again this will wear in time as will gun bluing, parkerizing etc.  DLC coating is very tough, but expensive to have done."
Bladesmith,2v5kyp,weps_grd_pandemonium,1 point,Tue Feb 10 01:10:19 2015 UTC,"So if I were to use patina, would I have to remove the scales (g10 or micarta) every time I color it?"
Bladesmith,2v5kyp,weps_grd_pandemonium,1 point,Tue Feb 10 02:22:04 2015 UTC,"G10 is impervious to ferric chloride. Micarta is less so, as it is a little more porous and may discolor. You could always make removable scales and take them off if you need to re-etch in Ferric as well"
Bladesmith,2v0fvb,madeulook1,3,Fri Feb 6 18:59:47 2015 UTC,"A few tips for the next one.  If you get a bend during heat treat, the best time to correct it is during tempering.  Clamp the blade flat or just a touch past flat while you temper, I used a glass pie pan a couple times with perfect results.  After heat treat, the blade will be like glass, and after temper it will spring back, and then break, but is very difficult to bend.  I would also recommend putting a bunch of holes in your tang to allow to glue to get better purchase.  It will allow the epoxy to bridge over to the other scale and keep everything bonded better.  Nicely done, especially for a first effort."
Bladesmith,2v0fvb,perfunctificus,3,Fri Feb 6 22:11:35 2015 UTC,Thank you very much! I'll take that advice to heart!
Bladesmith,2v0fvb,Lobo64,3,Sat Feb 7 00:09:39 2015 UTC,"You might want to remove the temper next time. I'm not quite sure I follow your process after the tip snapped but I read it like you cut it straight after (while it's still tempered) and then started filing after that? If that's correctly read by me then I assume the only reason you were able to file it at all is because you heated the steel up by cutting it.   In case you don't know: To take out the temper, heat the blade back up and then let it cool down slowly. This pretty much makes the steel as soft as it'll get which will make cutting, filing and sanding it much easier."
Bladesmith,2v0fvb,perfunctificus,1 point,Sat Feb 7 00:13:34 2015 UTC,"Looks like he didn't do any filing after heat treat, just recut the spine with an abrasive wheel down to the existing edge.  Just to keep the terminology straight for future reference,  the ""temper"" is the process of taking out some hardness and adding strength and toughness after the quench.  I know what you meant but for a beginner talking about the whole heat treating process as ""the temper"" could be confusing.  The process you are talking about here is annealing, which is taking the steel back to it's softest state.  It takes a little more than just letting it cool slowly, and is best done by taking the blade to critical and then putting it in an insulating medium like vermiculite so it really takes a long time to cool down.  I've also seen people doing it with a wood or coal fire by just leaving it in the coals and letting the whole thing die and cool slowly over several hours."
Bladesmith,2v0fvb,Lobo64,1 point,Sat Feb 7 18:59:27 2015 UTC,"Right, I always mix up the words in English. The reason I assume the blade is still hardened is because of the imgur comments mentioning how much longer it took to both cut and file the blade after reshaping the blade.   Op mentions:  "" Cutting that was a BITCH. The hardened steel did not give up easily. Took me damn near 45 minutes with a cutoff wheel, 40 grit.""  and  "" Back tot he jig to finish the edge bevel. Again, not giving it to me easily, for sure. This took some hours to get done..."""
Bladesmith,2v0fvb,thegreatdivide,1 point,Sat Feb 7 19:49:45 2015 UTC,"So, half and half there - The file work on the spine was done while annealed. Then I tempered it, and then, SNAP! I cut the blade post temper, to it was hard as hell. I agree - the better approach would have been to anneal it again, and cut, them heat treat. I'll chop that up to lack of experience, which I learned from! The rest of the file work was to take down the dime thickness of the blade, and put the edge to it. I didn't want to heat treat with the steel too thin on the blade.  [EDIT] SP and grammar..."

Bladesmith,2uv1j7,obeythehypnotoad,3,Fri Feb 6 06:32:26 2015 UTC,"Gluelines appear when surfaces are not flat.  Theres really not a lot of reason why anyone cant get a good flat surface on wood.  Make your cut with the finest tooth hacksaw you can find then lay a sheet of 120 grit on something flat. Have a look on ebay for granite cutting boards, or home depot  A piece of wood or metal doesnt cut it here.  Heck even dedicated surface plates are frustratingly cheap in the states.  I cant really tell what your specific problem is. it seems more like a misalignment of components than a glue line. The other issue you have is because the cuts are angled compared to the clamping surfaces(the butt and the face) then yeah a clamp is going to make them slide against each other and misalign.  I personally would cut the angles first, flatten, and then glue the two pieces together whilst the wood is still in block form. Then drill it, burn it in, and shape it.  You're saying your tang ends at around the glue joint? The tang should penetrate at least an inch into the back block otherwise the only thing holding it together is its joint to the bolster.  You can boil it to destroy the bond but it'll royally fuck the wood up too."

Bladesmith,2uoext,thesirenlady,0,Wed Feb 4 07:02:39 2015 UTC,"Its safe to assume that grain structure from the mill is totally fine. If you want to test it, when you're profiling your blanks instead of making a full cut, score a line and then snap the piece off.  Normalizing is done after forging to reduce grain size and dislocations from the heat and hammering.  Normalizing in a kiln is a pain in the ass anyway. Spend far too long getting the heat back up each time you open the door.  Oil quench for sure."

Bladesmith,2uj763,zzorga,8,Mon Feb 2 19:18:18 2015 UTC,I'd be honored!
Bladesmith,2uj763,QuiGonBen,10,Mon Feb 2 19:58:10 2015 UTC,(nod)

Bladesmith,2uj763,H8-Bit,7,Tue Feb 3 06:22:40 2015 UTC,That's one smooth mothershucker.
Bladesmith,2uj763,audiocycle,5,Mon Feb 2 22:14:47 2015 UTC,Very nice! I like the original concept and the finish looks great.
Bladesmith,2uj763,wkirbys,6,Mon Feb 2 17:44:25 2015 UTC,"Really liking this one, such a tidy design. Gonna have to have a go at making an oyster knife now."
Bladesmith,2uj763,calskin,2,Tue Feb 3 00:09:03 2015 UTC,Beauty!
Bladesmith,2uj763,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,2,Mon Feb 2 18:26:43 2015 UTC,Looks really cool. Could we get some closer up pictures? How did you do the tab for the bottle opener?
Bladesmith,2uj763,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,4,Mon Feb 2 19:04:42 2015 UTC,OP delivers: http://imgur.com/a/falsY
Bladesmith,2uj763,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,4,Tue Feb 3 16:21:23 2015 UTC,Nice man. That thing is sexy.
Bladesmith,2uj763,Hekalus,2,Tue Feb 3 16:57:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll post a few more tonight when I've got it in hand again. The steel I used was an old leaf spring so it had a 1/4"" hole in the end anyway. I drilled a couple more pilots on either side of the tab and hand-filed the rest."
Bladesmith,2uj763,jp3592,2,Mon Feb 2 19:59:21 2015 UTC,That little lip on it is tight. I know that wasn't easy at that angle.
Bladesmith,2uj763,thunderbolt777,3,Mon Feb 2 20:27:34 2015 UTC,"ahh yeah the lip... I used a dremel with a cutoff wheel to gouge that in. It was a tight fit, but I used an older, smaller wheel."
Bladesmith,2ul9fc,NickJrAllDay,3,Tue Feb 3 02:18:27 2015 UTC,/u/aarongough has some good ones.
Bladesmith,2ul9fc,iolithblue,1 point,Tue Feb 3 04:59:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah i know of him, he has so pretty amazing knives."
Bladesmith,2ul9fc,iolithblue,1 point,Tue Feb 3 05:03:18 2015 UTC,"He also shows it is quite possible to make a useful, well made and finely finished knife without spending a small fortune on gear."
Bladesmith,2ul9fc,thesirenlady,5,Tue Feb 3 05:05:23 2015 UTC,Walter Sorrels breaks it down nicely
Bladesmith,2ul9fc,jp3592,1 point,Tue Feb 3 02:52:20 2015 UTC,Thanks man!
Bladesmith,2ul9fc,boxingnun,3,Tue Feb 3 03:53:59 2015 UTC,Definitely Walter Sorrels has some nice videos.

Bladesmith,2ul9fc,jp3592,1 point,Tue Feb 3 14:46:24 2015 UTC,"Also ""The Complete Bladesmith: Forging Your Way To Perfection"" is a good book to get"
Bladesmith,2ujtuk,lukexcameron,4,Mon Feb 2 19:51:49 2015 UTC,"I watched a video on youtube about a small Finnish town that makes puukos.  You could probably find that.  If, you know, you tried."
Bladesmith,2ujtuk,obeythehypnotoad,1 point,Tue Feb 3 03:08:19 2015 UTC,Not sure exactly which one you are looking for there are a ton on youtube.
Bladesmith,2ujtuk,jp3592,1 point,Mon Feb 2 20:07:47 2015 UTC,Do you remember anything about it?
Bladesmith,2ujffp,Shardplate,6,Mon Feb 2 18:09:21 2015 UTC,I think you are looking for Murray Carter
Bladesmith,2ujffp,jp3592,3,Mon Feb 2 18:40:39 2015 UTC,Most definitely.
Bladesmith,2ujffp,Verrence,1 point,Tue Feb 3 06:29:21 2015 UTC,Yes that was him. Sorry for the incredibly long reply delay :P
Bladesmith,2uh5lc,Wolvesblade,7,Mon Feb 2 03:21:07 2015 UTC,whats with the photo
Bladesmith,2uh5lc,-magilla-,1 point,Mon Feb 2 04:13:53 2015 UTC,"This is my friend's knife. I've tried telling him about the quality of his photos several times. It's no use, he doesn't listen"

Bladesmith,2ufflr,Benassi,3,Sun Feb 1 18:25:30 2015 UTC,"4"" blade ~4"" handle made from 1/4"" 5160. About an inch of blade full flat ground with swedge work. Professionally heat treated, cryotreated, and tempered by Peter's to 60hrc. Shadow boxed carbon fiber scales with nickel silver pins and a carbon fiber lanyard bead. Blood red kydex and scout carry clip make up the sheath.  Started as a 2x18 bar of 5160. All work performed with an angle grinder, dremel, and 1x30 belt sander. This is my 6th knife made to date."
Bladesmith,2ufflr,Scuzzbag,3,Sun Feb 1 18:34:05 2015 UTC,"That's awesome, the blade reminds me of my leatherman blade"
Bladesmith,2ufflr,BradenGV,2,Sun Feb 1 19:27:15 2015 UTC,"This is a dumb question but, that's not real carbon fiber right? Just something like G10 that has carbon fiber graphics? Or am I wrong?"
Bladesmith,2ufflr,BradenGV,5,Sun Feb 1 20:56:03 2015 UTC,"Not a dumb question considering how much G10/CF laminate there is. But no this is a real block of carbon fiber that was sent to me by a fellow knifemaker in a trade for some wood scales I had. Very strong material, impressive."
Bladesmith,2ufflr,Raltie,2,Sun Feb 1 21:01:52 2015 UTC,Very cool! How difficult was it to work with it? Was there any special tools needed?
Bladesmith,2ughff,choose_goose,2,Sun Feb 1 23:30:54 2015 UTC,They look great I cant wait to see finished product.
Bladesmith,2ughff,jp3592,2,Sun Feb 1 23:35:56 2015 UTC,Progress detail
Bladesmith,2ughff,weps_grd_pandemonium,1 point,Sun Feb 1 23:36:14 2015 UTC,"Really nice, what's your process for the glue up etc. on the handles if I may ask?"
Bladesmith,2ughff,weps_grd_pandemonium,1 point,Mon Feb 2 00:17:48 2015 UTC,I will use epoxy to set the handles and stainless pins (I countersink and peen for a strong mechanical bond)
Bladesmith,2ughff,weps_grd_pandemonium,1 point,Mon Feb 2 01:42:29 2015 UTC,"To be more specific, I was kind of wondering about the multipart sections, bolster and liner divider. Do you lay those out flat and press them together horizontally? Is it difficult to keep the flat and from buckling? They look like they are going to be really nice."
Bladesmith,2ughff,perfunctificus,1 point,Mon Feb 2 04:35:14 2015 UTC,First I make sure that the edges I'm about to epoxy together are as flat as possible. I then rough sand them to ensure a good bond. I used in this case rosewood/hard fiber/ebony - rosewood/hard fiber/g10 - and zebrano/hard fiber/ g10. I add a substantial amount of epoxy and clamp them as best as possible. after this I sand them flat (I've never been able to keep them flat with clamps). Hope this helps.
Bladesmith,2ughff,thesirenlady,1 point,Mon Feb 2 05:20:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks, sounds tricky but I'm going to give it a try at some point."
