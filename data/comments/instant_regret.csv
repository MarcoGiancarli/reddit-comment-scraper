Killing a mouse in a way that does not cause it pain is more humane because experiencing uncontrollable pain is not pleasant. It doesn't matter if I'm about to die, I'd rather not experience pain, and I'd imagine the mouse probably feels the same way. If you try to argue that than you're just insane."

Prove my perception and the mouses perception of pain are the same.  Does a trout experience pain?  How about a worm?  How about a bacteria, do you weep when you take antibiotics?  When you kill a fly?    Killing a mouse in a way that does not cause it pain is more humane because experiencing uncontrollable pain is not pleasant.   Pleasant is a human construct, you are anthropomorphizing, you are projecting human perceptions onto a mouse. You need to prove the mouse can perceive things the way a human does.. good luck.    Is being eaten alive more humane?  So you think trapping it, (whereby if we apply human emotions it would be greatly distressed), and then releasing it far away from it's home (still sticking with human emotions) to a field where it will likely be eaten alive by a bird or cat is somehow more humane than quickly snapping it's neck?      I'd rather not experience pain, and I'd imagine the mouse probably feels the same way   I imagine all sorts of things, it doesn't make them true.  You are telling me you know how a mouse feels?!!

instant_regret,3e2v5n,penlies,3,Tue Jul 21 17:54:56 2015 UTC,"OK, the two methods of culling vermin (poison vs trap):  Warfarin thins the blood. It's great for preventing stroke. And usually it wouldn't kill, except that rats and mice are constantly squeezing through tiny gaps, causing microscopic ruptures in the capillaries. Ordinarily not a problem, but if your blood doesn't clot it causes massive haemorrhage (sp?). Bleeding to death is actually a minimum stress way to die.  Neck snap (cervical dislocation) is a recognised humane method of killing in most of the world. Aside from a lot of reflex convulsing, twitching and so on death is very rapid indeed. Usually it's done in combination with concussion or stunning so that the mouse or rat is unconscious (to minimise stress, of course). Without the stunning there is a few seconds of pain, terror and distress.  On balance, warfarin poisoning is probably less stressful and more humane, essentially the animal will go into shock, then fall asleep, then die."

instant_regret,3dy0bn,SirNarwhal,17,Mon Jul 20 15:16:31 2015 UTC,"Throwaway because I don't want to get blacklisted from work.  There isn't really any ""viral media video service"", it's a bit more complicated than that. There's a couple of companies out there (Jukin, Storyful, etc) that will basically scan YouTube for any trending video and contact authors to get them on board with a licensing agreement. They usually give the author something like ... 50 bucks or 100 bucks and tell them ""hey, we're going to make you more money by managing rights"".   Obviously they get a massive share of earnings and the author hardly gets anything, but hey, 50 bucks for your stupid cat video is awesome!  The next part is actually pretty amazing, these companies will use the content ID system built in YouTube to identify anyone rehosting/talking about the video and hit them with content ID matches/copyright strikes to claim revenues from anyone who uses the video (whole, or as a short clip). News stations, vloggers, straight up rehosts, the market for every viral video is pretty huge.   Most of the videos are fine and would fall under fair useage laws, but there is actually no good way to appeal this. Every content ID claim is basically the first step to a legal claim and is something that needs to be solved by the two parties involved directly. At this point, you have two choices, either you pay them a licensing fee (from $250 to $10,000 depending on who you are) or you just take the hit and risk your business knowing that at any time they could take you down with a copyright strike. 3 strikes and your channel/income is gone.   It's essentially patent trolling on a YouTube scale, whoever reaches the viral video first can make 10x to 500x profit on their original agreement by going after anyone who ever wanted to use it.   There's way to fight it, as I said most of the uses would fall under fair use, but who is willing to go to court against a professional rights management company for x years just to try to protect their channel? Yep, no one."

Google just came up with a viable solution to let everybody post content and resolve disputes according to the law, while preventing the content on their platform from being taken down by false DMCA requests every 5 minutes.

The original post by johnknoefler  Here: https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3dq3b5/this_is_why_little_johnny_failed_wood_shop_class/   He's actually reposted someone elses original post several times to several different groups. He does this all the time.  Look at his profile:  https://www.reddit.com/user/GallowBoob  I'd say that's the definition of reposting and karmawhoring.
instant_regret,3dqelg,drocks27,9,Sat Jul 18 16:24:56 2015 UTC,You don't seem to understand what a repost is. Cross posting is different and in fact encouraged by redditquette
instant_regret,3dqelg,poptart2nd,3,Sat Jul 18 16:53:44 2015 UTC,"Gallowboob has never claimed anything he crossposts is his own, nor do most people who crosspost."
instant_regret,3dqelg,mrboston9,2,Sat Jul 18 17:00:31 2015 UTC,"So, if I'm an artist and post one of my photos, it's ok for Gallowboob to take my photo and crosspost it somewhere else without any credit to me? Because it's crossposting? If someone takes the time to put up a good post it's ok to just take it and post it to another group without any acknowledgement?  Point being, if he posts one of my photos that I created without any reference to me, he may not ""claim it's his"" but he sure is taking credit for it."
instant_regret,3dqelg,skrame,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:08:57 2015 UTC,"No, he's sharing it and putting it where more people will see it. If you want credit, then either share your photo in more places or put a watermark with your name on it."

instant_regret,3dqelg,drocks27,0,Sat Jul 18 20:24:59 2015 UTC,A lot of subs don't allow x-post in the title. Also that is what the other discussions tab is for.
instant_regret,3dqelg,poptart2nd,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:58:10 2015 UTC,I think you're confusing reposting and crossposting.
instant_regret,3dqelg,Gaggamaggot,2,Sun Jul 19 02:46:51 2015 UTC,"G'boob does post a lot, this is true. But s/he doesn't usually repost, and the stuff posted is usually (~80%) stuff I haven't seen. I'm off for the summer and it's too hot to go outside, so I waste a lot of time at Reddit. I think it's like this...  Was it posted here at /r/instant_regret recently? If it's posted again at the same sub within about three months or less then IMHO it can be considered a repost. But even so, the OP may not be to blame as the link may be different, and (as is often true in the case of news articles) the title of the article may be different as well. But stuff 'reposted' later than that is not generally considered a repost due to new people subscribing and others leaving, meaning many subscribers may not have seen it.  The most common cause of a ""repost!"" complaint seems to be a 'cross-post' or 'duplicate post'.  Cross-posting is one user posting the same item to several different subs, usually ones that feature similar content (I.E. r/abandoned, r/abandonedporn, r/urbanexploration, etc).  Duplicate posting is when you see something cool that a user posted at one particular sub (say a cute cat at /r/gifs) and decide you need to post it to another sub (say /r/catgifs) where it might be appreciated.  TL;DR - Not everything you see twice on Reddit is a repost.  /soapbox"
instant_regret,3dqelg,Gaggamaggot,2,Sat Jul 18 17:59:55 2015 UTC,Allow me...  As you can see here this link has been been posted at eight different subs.  The first four posts (including the one here at /r/instant_regret) were done by /u/GallowBoob.  Four other users saw /u/GallowBoob's posts and thought it would be a good idea to copy the link to other subs.  So as I said - it's not a repost.

instant_regret,3dmucw,randomclock,4,Fri Jul 17 21:33:50 2015 UTC,Being good at dancing in public has nothing to do with being good at dancing and has everything to do with having fun and not giving a fuck. Everyone will always find it awesome when you break it down as long as you commit.

The camera likely stuck out like a sore thumb from above the crowd and just a little bit of spacial awareness would have alerted the girl that the camera was there.

My point was that it creates an environment where people don't express themselves as they normally would because people will record.   Sure, it probably deters some from doing wrong and illegal things - great!  For others, it deters them from doing fun things because they are either insecure when the camera comes on, or just don't want to be plastered all over Youtube or Reddit.    On the other hand, the people that are recording are usually thinking to themselves that they will send the picture or video to friends or post it online to either get attention or bring negative attention to the person being recorded."

instant_regret,3dmucw,link5057,6,Fri Jul 17 18:37:45 2015 UTC,I'd argue that people being paranoid about being recorded so that someone can make fun of them on the internet is in fact caused by people recording other people to make fun of them on the internet.
instant_regret,3dmucw,SuitableDragonfly,6,Fri Jul 17 20:02:41 2015 UTC,"Ugh Jesus, if I doxxed you and used the same excuse would you still not think it's a shitty thing to do? If I told you everything you post online is fair game and I'm allowed to do shitty things to you just because they are possible, does that suddenly make things okay?  Yeah, she should know that some asshole could be filming her enjoying herself (in an embarrassing manner) and she shouldn't expect privacy, but I think what OP is lamenting is that we as a society have reached a point where this is the case."
instant_regret,3dmucw,weta-,0,Fri Jul 17 19:30:56 2015 UTC,"Where did I imply it wasn't a shitty thing to do? It's just a new harsh reality of the modern era. As well, doxxing is completely different from being filmed in public and having it posted online. If someone was following me recording everything I did and was posting it online without my consent, there might be a legitimate court case. Some dude going through my internet history from my name isn't NEAR  as creepy imo. However, just like if I post something other people disagree with on reddit, I should expect that doxxing could occur. It's nothing I like having around, it's just there and we have to learn about it and live around it. Just like you don't walk in dark alleys late at night, don't put yourself in a position to get doxxed where it can become a severe issue in your life. And if you are going around dancing in public, someone could be filming you  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow6IaHmDNLI"

Well there are many possible exceptions to the law and recording crime would probably be not illegal in most cases, publishing them in any way however would be illegal as long as the criminal is identifiable in any way.

As long as no one addresses me or touches me, I'm not gonna notice much of anything. It's easy to miss the sound of a chair.  Lower ass, present hands for armrests, adjust seat, plant ass on seat.    Now what's really fucked up is the camera in the corner of the house. Gotta be pretty paranoid in order to invest in home security on that level. Plus, who would bother uploading this?"

Doing that was really stupid and dangerous.   EDIT: Found some confirmation.  Dangers of Inhaling Fire Extinguisher Powder  Inhalation is one of the biggest dangers with fire extinguisher powder. It is very irritating to mucous membranes and may cause difficulties with breathing if inhaled in large enough quantities. Usually, in a small fire situation where you would be using one of the commonly seen extinguishers, there would not be enough dust to be breathed in. However, if it does happen, you should go to the hospital. The dust may coat your lungs on the inside, which can prevent oxygen from reaching the rest of the body.  Not all fire extinguisher powders are the same. They must be non-toxic in order to be safe for home and car use, but keep in mind that the powder may be irritating to skin and eyes. Avoid inhaling and certainly stay away from ingesting quantities of the powder. If you are in doubt as to the dangers, go ahead and call your local poison control or ER. They can advise you on what to do in any given situation  Source: http://servicefireequip.com/dangerous-fire-extinguisher-powder/"

There are a shitload more ABC extinguishers out there than there are BCs or PKs.  Source, owned a fire extinguisher business for 9 years. And NFPA 10 is the standard for fire extinguishers, unless you're a fire extinguisher, you aren't NFPA 10 certified. Now, somewhere along the line you may have taken a test that says you're familiar with it, but given that you seem to not know the most common extinguisher out there, it doesn't seem like it could have been that good a test. NAFED (the organization that published NFPA 10) doesn't have a certification for such, they do have a CFPS certification, but I highly doubt you have it. Oh, and for the record, I had to test yearly with the state on NFPA 10, 17, 17a and 96. Did that for over 12 years."

As we were walking there was this yellow mist just floating around and my young self decided I wanted to see what it taste like. To my surprise it tasted like lemonade only in gas form. My friends kept telling me to stop tasting it but why would I listen to them? Lemonade is delicious. Only to find out that someone kicked fire extinguisher and the product was spreading around the school. Didn't stop me from inhaling gas lemonade.

instant_regret,3cuak5,Dinosaur_Monkey,15,Sat Jul 11 06:50:06 2015 UTC,"Feel free to share your shitty experience over at /r/FuckBestBuy!  I bought an Asus gaming laptop in February of 2014. The employee asked if I wanted to buy the warranty, and said it covers ANYTHING except submersion in fluids. I said sure, why not. Fast forward to a few months ago. I'm at my house playing a game and I get a call from my father in law saying that my wife has been in an accident. He got a call from the police, and all that could tell him was that she was on her way to the local hospital. I grab my computer and run out the door. I realize I left my keys inside. Set my computer on my car, run back inside to get my keys, and jump in my car. I live next to the loop, so I turn on to it. A few seconds later I see something fly off the back of my car. FUCK. Pull over, grab it off the side of the road (it's destroyed of course) and get to the hospital. Luckily she only has a broken leg.  Next day I go to best buy and tell the customer service person what happened. She sends me to geek squad where they tell me it's not covered. Talk to manager, he refuses. Also refuses to put me into contact with the district manager. He says that since I have no way to prove what the employee told me about the warranty I'm shit out of luck.  Call a few stores and ask the computer employees if it would be covered. A couple say yes, get transferred to the manager, he denies they said that and that they are telling him they didn't say that. Fucking wow.  Call corporate, they say the same. I give them the employee's ID number from the receipt, and they refuse to look it up so we can ask them what they said the warranty covers. She refuses to give me the district managers contact info. I ask to speak to her manager, and after 30 minutes on hold I hung up because I had to pick up my daughter. Tried again later and had an hour wait time both times.  I've filed a complaint with the BBB with no response.  I've also contacted stores and I tell them what happened to my laptop, but I say i didn't have the insurance on it and they tell me that would be covered 100% had I had the warranty. Then tell them I did have the warranty and they immediately say they are going to grab a manager then deny ever saying that.  I spend $1,500-$2,000 a year at best buy and never buy large purchases off Amazon because I want to be able to walk in and get my problem solved. Since that now has no benefit, fuck it. I'll just put my Amazon prime to work.  A lot of people start talking shit every time I post this saying its a warranty and they don't claim it covers accidental damage, so here is an image from their site about the warranty:  http://i.imgur.com/KXrUXZ3.jpg  http://imgur.com/EyKsYXf  Update:a few days ago I emailed the CEO my experience and a member of the ""Best Buy Executive Resolution Team"" contacted me and told me they would not be upholding the warranty."

instant_regret,3cuak5,mostlybran,5,Sat Jul 11 03:42:32 2015 UTC,I enjoy them but they seldom make me finish. I like them as a lead-in to something else but by themselves I think I just feel teased.

instant_regret,3c3lev,SuitableDragonfly,3,Sat Jul 4 17:45:50 2015 UTC,What is that even supposed to mean? What I'm talking about is animals in Africa had to evolve to be smart to live with humans. There used to be elephants on every continent (except Antarctica) until humans wiped them out. This applies to quite a few species. In Africa there were many different types of elephant but only a few evolved to survive with humans.

instant_regret,3bvxvu,Jaiez,3,Thu Jul 2 23:14:06 2015 UTC,"Story time!  TL;DR:  Don't let your kid play a contact sport if you don't want him getting hurt.  Also, don't be a huge asshole.  I refereed ice hockey from about 13 to 16.  One game I was partnered up with an older guy (to me at the time), maybe mid 20s, quite large dude.  I was in the corner watching the play, puck comes over, people chasing it, then this kid (bantam league, so 13-14 years old) just gets CRUSHED by a check.  It was a perfectly clean hit, I was literally two feet away and saw the entire thing.  Kid that got hit went down, I stop play and wave over coaches and whatnot.  Honestly, he probably just got the wind knocked out of him which feels like death but really isn't that bad.  The rink goes quiet, which is normal when anyone goes down.  Meanwhile, this guy's dad is going ballistic in the stands.  ""WHAT THE FUCK REF HOW CAN YOU NOT CALL THAT WHEN MY KID IS LAYING ON THE ICE?  YOU STUPID FUCK LEARN HOW TO CALL THE GAME! SOMEONE GETS HURT YOU CALL A FUCKING PENALTY YOU HOME TOWN PIECE OF SHIT!"" (Note: it was a clean hit, just a wicked one. No penalty.)  I'm ignoring him, parents are stupid sometimes.  Kid gets up, skates to the bench under his own power, everyone lines up for a faceoff in the neutral zone, rink is still dead quiet.  As my partner was about to drop the puck I hear, ""Hey kid, FUCK YOU!""  I blew my whistle, turned around and told the rink attendant to remove that guy from the arena.  The dad saw me point at him and then the door and started freaking out even more.  The rink attendant and my referee partner (who thankfully was about twice the size of this dad) left the ice, walked over and explained that it was a clean hit, no penalty, and he could wait for his son 150 feet from the entrance to the rink, or we could stop play and wait for the cops to come pick him up for trespassing.  The dad eventually left, giving me the finger as he walked out the door.  Other than that, quite the uneventful game.  For those who don't know, hockey referees have complete control over the rink when a game is on.  We could clear the entire thing if needed, to the point of stopping play until cops showed up to help.  I had booted plenty of players and a few coaches from games but it was the first and only time I ever tossed anyone out of a rink, teen me felt pretty badass and pleased with how I handled it.  And very thankful my partner wasn't someone also my size, a scrawny teenager.    And yes, I had an escort out the door to my ride home."

instant_regret,3bvxvu,somajones,4,Fri Jul 3 03:02:03 2015 UTC,"What sucks about the whining as well, is that the spectators get in on it too. I'm a soccer referee but I only referee recreational and some actual league games for kids from ages 6 to 19. I'm only 17 but I started when I was 15 but it can be intimidating when kids older than you and even coaches are constantly getting on your ass about calls. Over time, you learn to brush it off, be confident in your calls, and stay in control of the game. But once in awhile, it can still get under your skin."
instant_regret,3bvxvu,No_Refunds,5,Fri Jul 3 00:48:53 2015 UTC,"I was a ref from around 12 to 15 years old, my dad also did it with me which was cool, but decided on lacrosse over soccer in high school so I stopped, but one incident has remained in my mind from that time. I was a sideline ref for a u-9 game, the head ref was also in high school, and a kid was taking a throw in. As I'm sure you know, you aren't allowed to lift your foot on a throw in, the kid did just that, and I stuck my flag up while lifting my leg and pointing to it with my other hand, the signal for such an infraction. The head ref waved me off, instead of doing something like coming over to talk to me (he wasn't very good).  But what made this stick in my mind was one of the parents loudly saying to another parent ""Stupid ref, there's no offsides for a throw-in"". That irritated the shit out of me seeing as I've spent hours studying and testing to be in this position, and all he has done is watch his kid play, obviously not understanding that a flag going up can mean more than offsides.  I explained what it was about at half-time to the head ref and he was like ""oh, oh well"". The end."
instant_regret,3bvxvu,celticguy08,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:37:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, while I hated being a center ref, my favorite thing about it was correcting coaches and spectators on calls. Like a coach is complaining about a player who's in offside position but hasn't played the ball and I'm like, you don't even know the rules to a game you're a coach in? As for throw ins, during rec games, I was always kind of lenient about it when it came to lower age groups but I would call it if I was center and one of my side lines flagged it."

Unless it's a friendly game or a knockout tournament then no points are involved in the end.   A win gives you 3 points, a draw gives both teams 1 point and you get 0 points for losing.  Edit: like in the world cup. The world cup starts off with the group stages. Groups of 4 and the top 2 teams of each group with the most points advance to the knockout stage where no points are involved.   Usually leagues have a table system. Where as I think in the NBA/NFL/MLB they use wins to determine who is on top soccer leagues use points. Goals still matter in the end though"

Misconduct may include acts which are, additionally, fouls. Misconduct may occur at any time, including when the ball is out of play, during half-time and before and after the game, and both players and substitutes may be sanctioned for misconduct.

Misconduct of article  Fouls and misconduct %28association football%29:       The referee may consider serious and/or persistent offences to be misconduct worthy of an official caution or dismissal from the game. Association football was the first sport to use coloured cards to indicate these actions.   A yellow card is shown by the referee to indicate that a player has been officially cautioned.  :38 The player's details are then recorded by the referee in a small notebook; hence a caution is also known as a ""booking"". A player who has been cautioned may continue playing in the game; however, a player who receives a second caution in a match is sent off (shown the yellow card again, and then a red card). Law 12 of the Laws of the Game (which are set by the International Football Association Board and used by FIFA) lists the types of offences and misconduct that may result in a caution. It also states that ""only a player, substitute or substituted player"" can be cautioned. A player is cautioned and shown a yellow card if he/she commits any of the following offences:   Unsporting behaviour Dissent by word or action Persistent infringement of the Laws of the Game Delaying the restart of play Failure to respect the required distance when play is restarted with a corner kick, throw-in or free kick Entering or re-entering the field of play without the referee's permission Deliberately leaving the field of play without the referee's permission   What constitutes cautionable unsporting behaviour is generally at the referee's discretion, though the Interpretation and Guidelines which accompany the Laws list a number of examples.  :123 These include simulation intended to deceive the referee, or attempting to score by handling the ball. Fouls which are committed recklessly or fouls which are committed with the intention of breaking up a promising attack are also considered unsporting behaviour and punishable with a yellow card. Fouls which are committed with excessive force, however, or which deny an obvious goalscoring opportunity for the player fouled (i.e. a professional foul), are punishable by a red card.  A change in 2004 to the Laws of the Game championed by FIFA President Sepp Blatter mandated automatic yellow cards for players who remove their shirts while celebrating goals, as he considered this to be unsporting behaviour. In addition, an instruction has been in the additional instructions at the end of the Laws of the Game for some time that should a player jump over or climb onto a perimeter fence to the field of play, he or she should be cautioned for unsporting behaviour. This was seen as mainly preventing incidents in professional football matches where crowds had rushed towards players and had led to injuries.  In most tournaments, the accumulation of a certain number of yellow cards over several matches results in disqualification of the offending player for a certain number of subsequent matches, the exact number of cards and matches varying by jurisdiction. In the UEFA Champions League, for instance, accumulating two yellow cards in a stage of the tournament will lead to a one-game suspension. In such situations players have been known to deliberately incur a second booking in a tournament when the following game is of little importance, deliberately resetting their yellow card tally to zero for subsequent games. However, while technically within the laws of the game, this is considered unsportsmanlike conduct, and UEFA has launched an investigation resulting in fines or suspensions.   The idea introducing a sin-bin for yellow card offences has been mooted by, amongst others, UEFA president Michel Platini.   A red card is shown by a referee to signify that a player has been sent off.  :38 A player who has been sent off is required to leave the field of play immediately, must take no further part in the game and cannot be replaced by a substitute, forcing his team to play a man fewer. Only players, substitutes and substituted players may receive a red card. If a team's goalkeeper receives a red card another player is required to assume goalkeeping duties (teams usually substitute an outfield player for another goalkeeper if this option is available).  Law 12 of the Laws of the Game lists the categories of misconduct for which a player may be sent off. These are:   Serious foul play Violent conduct Spitting at an opponent or any other person Denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goalscoring opportunity by deliberately handling the ball (this does not apply to a goalkeeper within his own penalty area) Denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity to an opponent moving towards the player’s goal by an offence punishable by a free kick or a penalty kick Using offensive, insulting or abusive language and/or gestures Receiving a second caution in the same match  :39   Serious foul play is a foul committed using excessive force (i.e., ""the player...is in danger of injuring his opponent"").  :117 Violent conduct is distinct from serious foul play in that it may be committed by any player, substitute, or substituted player against any person, e.g., teammates, match officials, or spectators.  :127  In most tournaments, a single direct red card (i.e. not one received as a result of two successive yellow ones) results in disqualification of the offending player for one or more subsequent matches, the exact number of matches varying by the offence committed and by jurisdiction. If a goalkeeper receives a red card, the player that was substituted out in order to accommodate the replacement goalkeeper will not be suspended for the next game. Should a team's on-field players receive a total of five red cards, they will be unable to field the required minimum of seven players and the match will be abandoned.  The idea of using language-neutral coloured cards to communicate a referee's intentions originated with British football referee Ken Aston.  Aston had been appointed to the FIFA Referees' Committee and was responsible for all referees at the 1966 FIFA World Cup. In the quarter finals, England met Argentina at Wembley Stadium. After the match, newspaper reports stated that referee Rudolf Kreitlein had cautioned both Bobby and Jack Charlton, as well as sending off Argentinian Antonio Rattin. The referee had not made his decision clear during the game, and England manager Alf Ramsey approached FIFA for post-match clarification. This incident started Aston thinking about ways to make a referee's decisions clearer to both players and spectators. Aston realised that a colour-coding scheme based on the same principle as used on traffic lights (yellow - caution, red - stop) would traverse language barriers and clarify whether a player had been cautioned or expelled.  As a result, yellow cards to indicate a caution and red cards to indicate an expulsion were used for the first time in the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. The use of penalty cards has since been adopted and expanded by several sporting codes, with each sport adapting the idea to its specific set of rules or laws.

instant_regret,3avy65,Akoustyk,0,Wed Jun 24 07:53:53 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt that would be the reason over cost savings. Jean companies don't give a shit about other people's paint, but they do care about 20 cents saved on a brass rivet."
instant_regret,3avy65,AnalInferno,-3,Wed Jun 24 12:46:00 2015 UTC,"Once I figured out the rivets did that, there is no way I was ever going to buy a pair of pants that had them.   so, sure, they don't give a shit if my paint is ruined, but I do, and they care if I buy their pants or not.   It would also stand to reason that they'd be concerned about the rivet consts in teh first place. It's not like sewing technology reached some new level that allowed them to make rivet savings. They could have made those rivet savings with the first pair of pants if they wanted. Right?   It could have been that although the rivets themselves cost money, they saved money because of the manufacturing process, or something."
instant_regret,3avy65,Akoustyk,2,Wed Jun 24 21:00:11 2015 UTC,"Nearly every company makes higher quality goods at the beginning, then cheap out once they have a following, that's just how business works. Craftsman used to make their tools in the USA with quality materials, but now they have them shipped in from China for much less with lower quality materials. Why wouldn't they just do that from the start? Well, they wouldn't have gotten their good name that way. The same goes for pants, appliances, tools, etc etc etc... If you want sewn seams, so be it, it works better for you. Rivets last longer and are more expensive, but have the side effect of being slightly abrasive. Most people don't care about this sort of thing, but the minority who not only leans against cars, but also cares about the finish, do. Mine have rivets, but I also don't dare lean on cars (definitely not other people's) unless I cover the paint first."

It would make sense to stop using them because of the feedback they got for them, from people like me.   You might not give a shit about rivets on your back pockets, but I do, and I'm not alone. Do you know how many people care? No, you don't know. You're just saying fucking anything so you don't look stupid."

I'm not a car nut but shit, lets be honest here, it's my baby and I'm not loaded so a waterlocked engine wouldn't be my idea of fun. This guy pulls up behind me, honks and cusses me out for being a pussy. I back and he drives past me telling me how his cupholder, weird i know, is more valuable than my entire car. No later after he says that, he drives his truck into the water and the lights go out, I heard a seizing bending sound coming from his truck.   All you see is this foo climbing out his truck, watching it float away calling out to me to drive my car into the water so we can pull his truck out. He was in a raised Tundra, I am in an 05 sunfire.

instant_regret,3at0pw,htmlcoderexe,2,Wed Jul 8 17:05:25 2015 UTC,What makes gasoline more dangerous than lighter fluid or oil?
instant_regret,3at0pw,mrmcmaine,7,Tue Jun 23 22:27:13 2015 UTC,"DistantKarma basically has it right but its not so much that its explosive that makes it dangerous as that it fumigates, or turns into a vapor - which is flammable, thus giving it its 'explosive nature'. This is why your not allowed to fill gasoline containers inside the beds of trucks, you are supposed to take them out and place them on the ground which reduces the chance of static shock igniting a flame. This is why your not supposed to use a cell phone either, they create an electromagnetic field and under the right conditions can cause enough of a spark to ignite gasoline vapors. I'll use what happened to me as an example.  It labor day weekend where a friend and myself are preparing to roast some hotdogs, however it had rained recently and all my 'clean wood' (tree branches etc) were wet. So we decided to start the fire with plywood and a bunch of other wood you wouldn't want to cook over anyways so we could get a good base of coals going that would light the good wood. That wood was wet too though, so we built a 4ft tall tepee in my firepit and I poured 1/2 to 3/4 of a 16oz water bottle of gas all over it with some inside the tepee. Having messed with gas/homemade napalm bombs (which are super fun but defiantly dangerous) I knew to be careful so I waited like 5 min for the fumes to dissipate. I took a 4 or 5 ft long branch and waded up some paper at the end of it. Lit the paper and while extending my arm as far as I could I stuck the stick into the tepee. Next thing I knew a giant fireball had engulfed me with a giant boom my mom heard in the house. My hair was on fire and before my friend could yell it I was 'stop drop and rolling' on the ground. My friend said that the fireball was easily 8' in the horizontal direction, I guess I built the tepee so well the explosion literally couldn't go anywhere except out the one hole I was lighting it through.  I spent a day or two in the hospital jacked up on morphine, I really don't remember much. In fact a few friends stopped by to see me and we apparently had an hour long conversation that I remember none of.  Point being is that even a small amount of gas can create a large amount of flammable (explosive) vapor. Used/New motor oil does not create this 'explosive force field' since it doesn't evaporate under normal conditions. Usually not even ""sparks"" will cause it to ignite - it requires more of an ""open flame"" to force combustion. Diesel fuel is similar in the sense that it's fumes are not flammable so you don't get the 'explosive force field' around what you pour it on - or so I have been told. However I err on the side of safety now and use a little oil if its necessary. Also I build a much better wood storing spot for my mom's house and when i visit the wood is usually dry."

instant_regret,3at0pw,mrmcmaine,5,Tue Jun 23 22:48:53 2015 UTC,"It's still fairly unsafe due to its volatility and evaporative properties. Moreso than lighter fluid or other volatiles, gasoline vapor expands and lingers. In the end, you get one of a few scenarios:   Pour onto open flame. Fireball expands and catches you. Pour and light. Fireball which lights before you expect due to vapor spread catching before you get to the fuel you can see. Pour, wait a bit, light. Vapor disperses, and becomes either functionally useless or a really BIG fireball."

Like happened in this gif.  It actually could have been worse if the whole gas can had exploded at once.  Even if you're using something safer, like lighter fluid, you should never pour an accelerant directly on a fire.  You should always soak your fuel prior to lighting it."

instant_regret,3at0pw,mrmcmaine,3,Tue Jun 23 22:25:46 2015 UTC,It's the lack of O2 that's the issue. You need the right mix of oxidizer and fuel.
instant_regret,3at0pw,workpuppy,2,Tue Jun 23 22:28:38 2015 UTC,It the canister was full.  When you pour it out air replaces the fuel and you get oxygen in there.  It absolutely can get in there and explode.
instant_regret,3at0pw,pirateninjamonkey,3,Tue Jun 23 22:45:38 2015 UTC,"if the air fuel mixture was right it would have combusted as soon as the flame went to the tip. Gasoline produces a lot of fumes so any air that would go into the tub would quickly be over saturated with fumes to cause a clean combustion.

He's putting aside his immediate short-term wish to fly around in a Star Wars spacecraft to be with his new love and nurture their relationship. Maybe he's thought ahead and decided that (for now, at least) he can set aside his own personal dream to team up with his SO and work together on establishing themselves. If she loves him as much as he loves her, I bet she'll freely allow him to pursue his dream when circumstances better allow for it (maybe for now they've put down on a house and need to pay off the mortgage, or maybe she arrived pregnant, who knows)."
instant_regret,3apctb,DarthContinent,6,Mon Jun 22 16:55:31 2015 UTC,I like how you're looking for a silver lining!  Maybe his true love is a genie? Maybe he knows he can't afford x-wing fuel? Or he knows that wheelbarrow of money isn't that much due to wishing well-induced hyperinflation?  All valid arguments.

Alas, one wish per customer. It's just kind of darkly ironic humor."
instant_regret,3apctb,satanisativa,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:08:38 2015 UTC,Oh. I thought his wish affected everyone else since it was so vague so Luke and Superman stopped fighting villains to go be with Leia (assuming this is around Empire and he doesn't know of they're related yet) and Lois Lane and soon evil is going to dominate the universe. Personally I'd rather have true love than spaceships or super powers anyway. I'm corny like that.
