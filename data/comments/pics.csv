pics,3c8ioj,llano11,"The fact that they destroyed some statues from one of the oldest civilizations of mankind still kind of makes me sad. It's a part of humanity's heritage gone forever, that can now only be reconstructed, represented, or recreated... but it will never be the same.\n\nI've come to accept that there are constructive and destructive forces in this world. Be it some fundamentalist dipshit that doesnt understand the importance of a few statues, or a hurricane that (literally) mindlessly destroys hundred's of people's lives. Sometimes shit gets wrecked and we can do nothing about it except trying to clean up later.\n\nBut we can also be an active force of creation. The pyramids, the Great Wall, the Statue of Liberty, the Leaning Tower, the Eiffel Tower, etc. etc. We can leave a positive mark in this world. Be it large and majestic, or small and mundane-ish (making someone's day, being polite, properly raising a child, etc).\n\nI would rather be a force of creation than of destruction. That is the meaning of life, for me."

pics,3c8ioj,migraine_boy,It's such a terrible thing for this to be happening because these heritage sites aren't just Syria's or Ancient Romans'. It's basically a landmark for all of humanity at this point. Some truly ancient buildings and structures that should be treasured no matter who is occupying the nation. \n\nAnd the vow ISIS made to destroy the Sphinx and the Pyramids is also worrying because they are attempting to make inroads into Egypt and destroy the very last of the remaining 7 ancient wonders of the world if they manage to take down the Great Pyramid of Giza.
pics,3c8ioj,Shippoyasha,"I can tell you based on what my father, career Army, has told me of Egypt's military capabilities; This will never happen.  Egypt is ruled by a military dictator in charge of an Army that is somewhat well led (good enough) and well armed with US armory, and well aware of the mistakes it made in it's war on Israel.  Egypt would utterly embarrass any ISIS incursion."
pics,3c8ioj,alflup,"My roommate for the last couple years was Egyptian and the way he explained it to me was that since military service is more or less mandatory for everyone, there's a lot of national pride in the military as the military and the 'people' are pretty synonymous. So like when that coup happened it was less so a military dictator taking control rather than it was closer to 'the people' just kicking out their government. In that way, if ISIS ever tried to make strides in Egypt, they wouldnt just be facing opposition from the military, obviously, but from a huge chunk of the general population as well. ISIS wouldn't stand a chance."

pics,3c8ioj,Level3Kobold,"It's not quite that level of naïve. However, /u/alflup is also somewhat incorrect. IS does have a presence in Egypt numbering roughly 1000 fighters. These fighters have been based in the Egyptian Sinai for over a decade. They originally had ties to Al-Qaida through Al-Zawahiri. Originally, they focused on attacking Israel. However, after the coup against Morsi in2012 this group has focused its attacks against the Egyptian state. While originally calling themselves Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis, they swore allegiance to IS on November 10th, 2014. With this, they changed their name to the ""Sinai Province,"" which denotes their role as the leaders of this province in the views of the Islamic State. These insurgents have successfully harassed the Egyptian military in the Sinai and even made successful attacks in Cairo, including assassinating a head government prosecutor last week. However, their ability to actually take and control land inEgypt outside of Sinai is extremely limited because of the strength of the Egyptian army and a lack of support inside of most large urban centers."

I used my time the way I felt most valuable and the fact is that it IS my passion, regardless of whether it earns me a living.

pics,3c8ioj,iTAMEi,"It's a vicious cycle. Bad people started to take over back in the 70s, so we gave the people and militia ammunition to fight back. Then even worse people with tons of ammo took over, and the people had no protection. Then the US got involved after 9/11 and trained the people to fight back against the Taliban/Al-Qaeda, and they were removed. Now we've started to leave and more crazies with guns took over, now enrolling children to their forces and mass murdering civilians to spread terror just like every other organization in the past.\n\nThe correct answer is no answer. There is nothing one country can do to stop these people, and every option gives a shitty result. Doing nothing lets them spread and kill more innocent people, and then we'd suffer of guilt by turning a blind eye. Going in and fighting would sacrifice thousands of American lives for little result, considering the other accidental civilian casualties that will result from bombings and their guerrilla tactics. Straight up nuking the state would start a chain of shit that would probably destroy half the world. It would take a world effort to end the influence of ISIS in the Middle East, something bigger than the US, or even all of NATO alone."
pics,3c8ioj,TonesBalones,At this point I'm wondering why a First World country doesn't just go full British on the problem and basically annex the region and commit to bringing that region to order by force. It seems to me that our problem is that we keep looking for a sane person to take power from inside the country and that is looking increasingly unlikely so at this point why don't we just have an outside government take control forcibly for the next 100 years until that region has its shit under control.\n\nIt's basically a shithole of a country and at this point I'd be OK with even China turning that place into a Chinese colony rather than letting it fester even further.

Nobody can go in with a 10 year plan and hope that when they leave no crazies will attempt to fill the void.\n\nIn a certain light it's something I'd like to see NATO do, but then none of the participating counties could actually be OK with it. What if it was OUR country that was next!?\n\nI sadly think we're stuck with very limited options and they all really suck. Meanwhile this will continue plaguing the world."

As bad as they thought it was under Assad, this shit would have never happened if the country wasn't weakened from all of this.   Amirite? \n\nAmericans tend to romanticize revolution due to our own history, which turned out OK.

pics,3c8ioj,poncewattle,Several people said the revolution was a mistake because it would create a power vacuum for worse people to come in. And it looks to me like that happened.
pics,3c8ioj,Arluza,"I think there are circumstances specific to this revolution, that may not pertain to revolutions in general, and which could not have been foreseen in 2011.\n\nIf you recall at the beginning, there was no talk of ISIS. It was all Assad versus the protesters. As the violence from the regime ramped up, soldiers deserted Assad's army to form the FSA. It actually looked like Assad might fall. \n\nHere's where Russia came in with a never ending supply of weapons for their ally, Assad, allowing him to hold on to power in western Syria. I think the west could have tipped the scales at this point, but nobody wanted to get involved.\n\nInto this stalemate poured religious warriors from all over the Middle East (and to some extent Europe). Meanwhile US and it's lapdogs had spent a decade destroying Iraq, and then left it to its predictable fate. So eastern Syria and western Iraq were ripe for the taking, and there was no way an Islamic state wasn't going to be created at this point.\n\nBut imagine the west had never invaded Iraq. Imagine there had been no Russian military aid. Imagine there had been American military aid. Or imagine that Assad had not had the stomach for waging war on his own people, who were, after all, protesting peacefully at first. If any of these factors had been different, the trajectory of the Syrian revolution would have been very different too."

Trouble was that many Ukrainians still wanted it and so protested about it.

pics,3c8ioj,Anivia_is_not_kfc,"The Iranians nationalised a British oil company (Anglo-Persian Oil, now BP) which owned much of the oil fields in Iran, since the Iranians were getting little of the royalties from the oil. Around the time, the Saudi Arabian govt were able to persuade an American oil co into sharing profits 50-50. Iran wanted something similar, but the British govt refused.\n\nThe nationalisation angered Britain so they persuaded the US to help overthrow the government by saying Iran could become communist. The US agreed and the government was overthrown."

pics,3c8pl5,carriehunt,Give me the science please
pics,3c8pl5,ASmileOnTop,"The white part is what was above the waterline. What happened is that at one point that top portion was under water\n\nThen the bottom portion of the iceberg melted enough for the center of gravity to shift above the waterline which caused the iceberg to flip. But that stripe that you see was submerged in both orientations.\n\nLastly a portion of one side of the iceberg broke off or melted and the center of gravity shifted to one side, causing the tilt that you see here.\n\nEdit: wellll I was wrong! I kind of assumed it was due to the ice forming underwater but apparently it is when the moving fresh water is frozen quickly. So this must have formed from a deep crevice which quickly froze some fresh water and the iceberg turned afterwards\n\nCredit to /u/wiyumishere for making me look it up"
pics,3c8pl5,waffleocalypse,"Very true, but the coloration change is due to the time it takes for the ice to freeze if I am not mistaken."
pics,3c8pl5,wiyumishere,"You are correct. To go in further detail, the white ice is younger and less dense than the clear ice.  \n\nIcebergs come from glaciers and glaciers are formed from snow compacting overtime and not melting during the summer months.  Over time the snow, due to pressure becomes more dense and forms into solid ice. White ice is much younger and less dense, the clear ice is much older and very dense.  I cant explain the patterns though ahah maybe some type of up thrust of the clear ice over time."
pics,3c8pl5,mmbah_,"This situation is more complicated.  What you have described is normal for glacial ice with depth, and to form glacial ice the compaction process must have occurred on land where this iceberg originally formed, however, that's not what explains the clear ice.  The transition from snow to firn to compacted glacial ice occurs over several metres due to the weight of the overlying snow.  Knife-edge sharp contacts like the ones in this picture are not typical of the gradual transition expected from compaction processes.\n\nThe clear ice forms planar (in 3D), cross-cutting, dyke-like structures.  The clear ice cuts across the whiter ice.  By the principle of cross cutting relationships, this indicates that the clear ice is younger than the white ice.  These are fracture infillings.  The white ice was cracked by stress within the glacier, forming brittle fractures (e.g., crevasses) that were subsequently filled with fresh water that then froze into clear ice.  All of this most likely occurred on land in the glacier long before it calved into an iceberg.  It probably looked something like this at the time (the picture shows water-filled crevasses, which would freeze in winter).\n\nIt is also possible to tell that the fractures filled with clear ice did not form at the same time.  The thickest fracture fill in the middle appears to be younger because if you remove it (see picture), the medium-thickness horizontal fracture lines up perfectly on either side of the gap.\n\nSo, the history was: 1) snowfall probably somewhere in Greenland a long time ago, 2) compact snow into the white glacial ice, 3) form the thinner horizontal fractures, 4) infill with water in the gap and freeze it into the clear ice, 5) crack yet again to form the diagonal, thicker gap, 6) freeze clear ice in the gap again, 7) someday, eventually, calve into an iceberg, 8) get carried south by the cold Labrador Current 8) get photographed by OP in the cold, cold seas off Newfoundland."
pics,3c8pl5,koshgeo,"Spotted the geologist! \n\nYou're mostly correct, and those that are questionable are likely correct. \n\nIt's important to note that areas with large amount of crevassing are also experiencing large differential stress, high flow speeds, and things lined up nicely may not stay that way irrespective of the age.\n\nAlso, ice lenses can give you similar apearing layered structures. \n\nThe big clear band is most definitely a crevasse, and the thinner one are likely older crevasse that have been thinned due to the differential flow. However, if they thinner ones are actually able to be determined to have been oriented horizontally across the ice, they are most likely ice lenses. \n\nThe flow and temperature history is required to precisely determine the origin of any of these structures."
pics,3c8pl5,CookingWithoutWater,"Yes.  I've seen glaciers and icebergs with pretty amazing folds in them, so things can get reoriented and distorted quite a bit.  But it looks like things line up pretty well and stay fairly linear/planar even in the older parts, so I don't think much ductile deformation is going on in this example by the time that the clear features formed.  It's still possible if the stretching was length-parallel, of course.\n\nIt's not clear to me what the original orientation of the layering is in the white areas of the ice.  That would clear things up (har) a bit."
pics,3c8pl5,koshgeo,Ahh that makes a lot of sense. Infill of cracks that were caused by some sort of stress.

pics,3c8pl5,Solitairee,Water sometimes freezes into ice when it gets chilly outside
pics,3c8pl5,frakjocker,Not a hydrolummin scientist here. The effect comes when water freezes in motion which eliminates small bubbles. This makes the ice look like blue glass when light passes gas inside the thingy.
pics,3c8pl5,saltnotsugar,Never trust a light fart.
pics,3c8pl5,LudicrousGibs,I'll have one science please.
pics,3c8pl5,wienerflap,"Paging glaciologist /u/iamdonovan! Iceburgs are kinda his thing. \n\nWant to drop a glaciology knowledge bomb? \n\nI'm also a glaciologist -- computational glaciologist that is. I tend to deal with ice crystal fabric and microstucture (small stuff), or verification and validation of continent scale ice sheet models (really big stuff). \n\n/u/waffleocalypse, /u/mmbah_, and /u/wiyumishere are all sort of on the right track -- they all have part of the story at least. \n\nThe white like color is due to entrapped air bubbles and impurities. Since glaciers form by the accumulation of snow, which gets compressed over time, there are many air pockets that get trapped in the firn (old snow). Once the firn reaches a high enough density, the air pockets are no longer interconnected (called the pore close-off depth), and the remaining trapped air gets compressed into bubbles. The deeper you go, the smaller these bubbles get and the clearer the ice becomes. A clear blue iceburg indicates old basal ice. \n\nOnce calved, icebergs exposed to air will melt, and ice crystals (crystallites or grains technically) preferentially melt along their grain boundaries. the air bubbles will also explosively decompress, both of which lead to the milky blue-white clear color seen in some icebergs as more and more grain boundaries and void spaces are able to refract the light. The portions of the ice burg underwater tends to stay the clear color because of how much more efficient melt is in the water. So when they roll over, you'll typically see the brilliant clear blue again. \n\nHowever, clear blue color layered into white ice like this indicates that the blue ice is water that has refrozen into the glacier -- typically a crevasse that became filled with water which then froze, or less likely, an ice lens. This happens at the top of the glacier and the surrounding glacial ice will be the less dense white kind because it hasn't  yet been compressed enough to become clear. \n\n\n\nPS You can hear the bubbles popping out of glacial ice in these areas, and glacial ice is best enjoyed in whiskey. \n\nPSS The underwater soundscape in fjords packed with icebergs is f-ing loud from the bubbles melting out. It's been hypothesized that seals use these areas to avoid predation because oracs can't use echolocation in these areas effectively. \n\n\n\nEdits: I can't haz good grammar."

pics,3c8pl5,ysopotato,What it looks like to me is a fissure in the glacier that was filled in and then frozen. The largest band is probably one of the newest additions to that chunk of ice. It's certainly younger than the smaller band that is being cross cut by it.

pics,3c7ls6,SonoftheMorning,"Totally retarded in this case, and generally speaking."
pics,3c7ls6,chisleu,"I love when a picture tells a story. That blue ice and crinkly appearance just screams ""glacier"". (Glacier ice really is blue. I thought it was all photoshop, until I saw an actual glacier.) Below the glacier is a little U-shaped valley. Streams don't carve valleys like that. The glacier used to fill that valley. And I suppose that oddly shaped mess of dirt & rock in front of the little valley is the old terminal moraine. There are no trees on it, and not even very many plants; the glacier was working that area relatively recently.\n\nHere, then, are the remnants of a formerly mighty glacier. In days of old days it carved a huge hole out of a mountain. But now it is a mere shadow of its former self. Global warming, right before your eyes, folks."
pics,3c7ls6,MultiKilMakaveli,"I studied Glaciology at the University of Calgary and studied the nearby Peyto Glacier in great detail. That summer the glacier receded revealing a cedar forest that it had mowed over. I later found out that they were dated to 1,300 years, and cedars don't grow anywhere on that side of the Rockies, really. Back then, the climate was warmer and wetter, leading to cloudier days, more snow (and therefore growing glaciers), and thicker cedar forests. Some people use this as an example against anthropogenic climate change, but I disagree. The one Thing I can say I learned from all my climatology and glaciology courses is that climates change with our without humans, but right now we are not helping the situation and we are not preparing for the change that is coming, let alone preventing it or slowing it's progress. For example, here in Calgary much of our water is from melted glaciers, but the glaciers that feed our reservoirs are shrinking and absolutely nothing has been done by a city of 1.3 million  and growing to consider that our water supply will halve soon."

pics,3c7yjg,jbiciestuff,Those are easy. Just put it on the stove on low heat until the sticker is warm and it will peel right off.

pics,3c7yjg,phoenixink,Nice tip. I learned something useful on reddit today :)
pics,3c7yjg,relish-tranya,You can also use lighter fluid or gas.
pics,3c7yjg,Zebleblic,"That's kind of beside the point. The point is that every single manufacturer can use what's called a low-tac adhesive for ANY decal or sticker and in putting a sticker (particularly a paper one) on ANYTHING without using low or mid-tac adhesive is just a complete mismanagement of a product and production.\n\nSo yeah, you can spend 20 minutes to take off a sticker that should be able to be removed instantly and without any issues by actually having someone manufacture something properly."
pics,3c7yjg,brightest-night,Or if you have already started peeling and have a mess... rub the sticker with a little lighter fluid (not butane) and it will come right off. Residue and all.
pics,3c7yjg,-Im_Batman-,I hate this. Nothing beats the satisfaction from a clean sticker pealing.

pics,3c7yjg,brunub,Soak it in warm water or get goo gone. It's annoying but it can be fixed.
pics,3c7yjg,Pepe_leprawn,Or just use a petroleum product like lighter fluid or gas. Way cheaper than goo gone and works instantly.

pics,3c7yjg,ThisIsNotTokyo,Actually wd40 is often the worst product for anything. \n\nGenerally this isn't a fault of wd40. It's just that it kinda works on anything so it gets a name of does everything. \n\nIt's a bad solvent\n\nA bad long term lubricant \n\nAn ok rust remover\n\nA c- flame thrower\n\nAnd a horrid slip and slide liquid.
pics,3c7yjg,shadovvvvalker,Oh shit - Water Displacement 40 doesn't work as cooking oil either. Someone in their marketing department must be proud that they get bought for ALL the wrong reasons.
pics,3c7yjg,bobbertmiller,"I have to deal with what happens to locks that people spray wd40 in cause ""it's a lubricant"" \n\nI am not a fan."
pics,3c7yjg,shadovvvvalker,"WARNING: PLEASE DO NOT DO NOT USE SOLVENTS SUCH AS THE ABOVE ON ANYTHING NON-STICK OR ELECTRONIC/MECHANICAL, OR THAT WILL COME INTO CONTACT WITH YOUR BODY\n\nReason: Solvents will remove most coatings, including Teflon and anti-glare coating from glasses. Solvents on electronics may interfere with function, or also remove adhesive from other parts of electronics should it drip. Fumes may also explode. Mechanical systems may not appreciate solvents coming into contact with greased parts, or may create higher temperatures that will ignite trace amounts of solvent."

pics,3c7yjg,joegringo,"So basically, these articles explain why I've never had issues with my solder jobs, and why I've never had issues with my crimp jobs either.\n\nI'm very picky about where I solder, I have to have plenty of room to do the job, and I've never put a solder in an are where it would flex. Then it gets heat shrinked and tied down tight with zip ties on either end and taped over.\n\nThe crimpers I use cost me 80 bucks, and get used where there's little room or flexing of the connection is possible. It also gets heat shrinked and taped to the harness, with zipties in areas where I feel they're needed.\n\nBut, I didn't think about the solder breaking free from the conductor in vibration prone areas, so I'll keep that in mind and be even more selective of where I solder versus where I crimp."

pics,3c83mc,OSUaeronerd,mirrors don't have to be glass....  really good chrome finishes can be functionally as reflective.
pics,3c83mc,Rentalov,"That's true.  However, chrome that thin would shatter also and be just as dangerous.  As could plastic with a chrome finish.  Polished metal could be highly reflective, but then the weight starts to become an issue. I do more mountain biking and have never owned a speed bike so perhaps I'm just being biased toward strength and durability than style."
pics,3c83mc,OSUaeronerd,if a thin plastic was placed over a normal spoked wheel I think it would stay safe and reflective.   Would further reduce drag as well!

I understand that a princess set is targeted towards girls but other sets don't really have such a fixed target group. Playmobil has got gendered sets, too, but many of their sets don't have a gender implication. The dog school and camping family are wrapped just as neutral as the police station or zoo enclosure or RC car."

pics,3c77pc,CoMaBlaCK,I imagine they're looking to appeal to a demographic that normally wouldn't buy Legos or have an interest in building.\n\nThe girls that have interest in building and enjoy Legos would be buying them anyway.
pics,3c77pc,karl2025,"Sure, though I imagine the difference between a toy line for girls and a toy line for children who like stereotypically girly things is probably a bit subtle for young folk. I think it's reasonable for a parent to be concerned about how companies advertise to their children and it's reasonable to expect a company to give some consideration to how their ads affect children beyond sales."
pics,3c77pc,CoMaBlaCK,"The commercial is straight out of the Barbie advertising playbook, they're trying to get a piece of that action obviously. \n\nAs far as Lego is concerned some parents that were going to buy their kid a Barbie might buy a Lego set instead and that's a positive for the company."
pics,3c77pc,Fat_Walda,"And let's be honest, a positive for that girl. Following directions, spatial skills, pretend play where you actually get to create something. Way better than a fashion doll."

pics,3c77pc,Fat_Walda,I played with Barbies as much as LEGO growing up. But you can't deny that there are things blocks teach kids that dolls can't. And Barbie's attempts to represent careers haven't always exactly promoted equality for girls. See Computer Engineer Barbie.

pics,3c77pc,Flapjack_,I don't see the problem here. It's sets of legos advertised to girls who may not like knights/pirates/star wars/whatever
pics,3c77pc,jebleez,"The problem is that they should be making pirate sets where the pirates are girls, castle sets where the knights are girls, spaceship sets where the pilots are girls, etc. It's no wonder most girls aren't interested in them as they are. They have nothing to relate to with the current sets. My son got a Lego Movie set for Christmas, and my daughter actually liked playing with it, specifically the Wild Style character. If they'd include girls in a regular set that aren't just boring, submissive, damsels in distress, I wouldn't be complaining."
pics,3c77pc,thatCITYguy,"Go to the LEGO website right now and just look through the sets. The are many female minifigures included in many different sets now, from construction workers to scientists to ninjas.

I'm sorry for the rant I'm just getting tired of seeing this opinion."

pics,3c77pc,whatareyalookinat,It shouldn't be an outlandish request to say that Lego sets should come with both male and female characters automatically.
pics,3c77pc,FOTBWN,They're mostly generic figurines with a basic smile on them. They can be whatever the kid wants.\n\nIts only adults who get in a huff over the supposed female:male ratio.
pics,3c77pc,whatareyalookinat,"If they were mostly generic, it wouldn't be an issue. \n\nAnd the reason some adults get into a huff about this is because of the larger implications at hand. When toys like Legos are geared towards boys, it gives young girls the impression that they shouldn't be building. And that has a lasting impact. That's certainly one of the reasons why there are so few women in STEM careers. And when cooking and homemaking toys are geared towards girls, it impacts the way future men feel about being stay at home dads. It may seem silly, but it's not."
pics,3c77pc,FOTBWN,"If they were mostly generic, it wouldn't be an issue.\n\n\nExcept they are. \n\n\nAnd the reason some adults get into a huff about this is because of the larger implications at hand.\n\n\nNo, its just adults that have nothing better to do with their time than have a crack at their version of social engineering. Leave the damn kids alone to play with their lego without bringing in politics when they're just playing with damn plastic bricks. \n\nLet the kids decide instead of jerking yourself off over whether John or Jill are playing with lego the 'correct' way."

pics,3c77pc,jebleez,How is anyone supposed to even know it exists to buy it if they don't sell it anywhere?

pics,3c77pc,Jameo_and_Sprite,"You don't have to go to their website to see the different sets.  You can go into any store that sells LEGO and see that he's right.  All the lines that aren't from a franchise that already have set characters in them have multiple females in them.  I don't know what country you're in but you should see all of them clearly on the box if you are in the US.  Also go into an actual LEGO store you will see an even more diverse line of different characters and sets.  Thats the beauty of LEGO, you can make anything you want.  But it really is up to you, the parent, to supply the bricks.  Its not up to LEGO to make perfect pre packaged sets to the exact specifications for you because you think your kid is special.  They try to reach the largest amount of fans that they can.  NOT JUST YOUR KID.  But there is a simple solution and thats just switching to Mega Bloks."
pics,3c77pc,jebleez,"Toys R Us, Target, Wal-Mart, etc. are what we have. Every single Lego toy that's not Lego Friends is in the ""boys"" section - Strike 1 against my daughter wanting them.\n\nLego does nothing to promote these firefighter girls, construction workers, etc., so kids never even see that they're out there - Strike 2 against my daughter wanting them.\n\nHow does me wanting a product that promotes critical thinking, mathematical concepts, engineering principles, etc. to not be marketed at only one gender make me want ""perfect pre packaged sets to the exact specifications for you because you think your kid is special""?\n\nIt's hard to get you to understand these concepts, since you don't have kids, but believe whatever you'd like, I guess."
pics,3c77pc,Jameo_and_Sprite,"Lego aren't in the ""boys"" section of those stores, they are in the LEGO isle, in the toy section of those stores.  More often than not LEGO takes on the entire isle. LEGO friends is geared toward a specific fan base and is slightly tweaked for them and placed in the appropriate isle.  Also LEGO must be doing something right with LEGO friends because it is a huge success.  Every other set (not including the new fairies sets because i haven't seen them in those stores) is in the LEGO ISLE, not boys section.  And you know, if you have a problem with the layout of the store than complain to Walmart or Target.  How they place there product is up to them. \n\nHow do they not promote the female mini figure?  They are on the front of the box with the rest of the set.  THE FRONT OF THE BOX. And usually about half of the  mini figure series are female, not to mention LEGO ideas scientist, which all 3 of them were female.\nAnd dont assume things about other people.  I do have kids, two little ones.  It seems its hard for you to understand an entire business model that is hugely successful doesn't revolve around you."

pics,3c77pc,Flapjack_,"idk man, go look at the Lego City line. I just went through and all the jobs, even stuff like Firefighter and Construction worker sets, all tended to have at least one lady fire fighter or lady construction worker.\n\nI think people see that LEGO Friends line and then just jump to conclusions."
pics,3c77pc,geekygirl23,They do you lazy bastard.
pics,3c77pc,Moist_Matt,He's talking about the LEGO friends set though. LEGO friends doesn't have knights and spaceships.
pics,3c77pc,jebleez,"And it's specifically marketed to girls, which is just pushing the stereotype further. There shouldn't be ""girl"" lego sets and ""boy"" lego sets at all.\n\nI don't know if you have kids, but I do, and I can already see the effects of marketing gendered toys to kids, and it's not cool. My daughter is 7 years old, and although she likes machines, things with gears, and other technical stuff, she refuses to play with stuff that's not fluffy and pink, because if it's not, she doesn't want to play with it because, ""That toy is for boys!"""
pics,3c77pc,Moist_Matt,"There's plenty of girls who do like pink and fluffy stuff though, and that's what this set is marketed to. There's nothing wrong with having more choice of LEGO sets. They made the friends set because people were complaining that there wasn't a typical ""girly"" set.\n\nI think you're right about the marketing of the other sets though. I watched some of the adds and there weren't any women even in the standard city set adverts. I never realised the city sets were considered ""boyish"". That does suck, I don't see why cities wouldn't be aimed for both genders.\n\nI also found it funny that they shoe horned a boy into the next ""girly"" set.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD85pf6hFuc"
pics,3c77pc,torma616,"I've got a problem with this. Knights weren't girls and to make knights that are girls, they're just pandering to the ""we have to be careful to not offend ANYBODY"" mindset. By all means, don't only make ""fairy"" sets market to girls, but don't change everything to make it all completely potentially inoffensive. \n\nI know I'm going to be downvoted for saying this, but the ""fairy"" (etc.) sets that they're making to market to girls likely won't be desired by boys. Now, they shouldn't be making gendered themed sets in the first place, but if they are going to still make them, and they're going to still make ones for strictly girls, what's wrong with making ones that are meant for strictly boys that won't appeal to girls."
pics,3c77pc,goblinish,"The whole idea of things like female knights weren't out of a need to not be offensive. Even little girls have dreamt of being a knight riding their stead to save some land from a tyrant. They make the female figures to  appeal to that sense of imagination. They aren't goign for historically accurate (seriously if you want to quibble about something being historically accurate there is a lot more material there than ""omg girl knights""). \n\nAs a matter of fact though there were indeed women fighting as knights, or in similar roles of knights. For more information look up The Order of the Hatchet as a start."
pics,3c77pc,jebleez,"Who cares? Seriously!\nLegos are about imagination. If you're going to limit all toys to being historically and/or scientifically accurate, then be prepared for some pretty dammed boring toys. That's a really terrible argument when the purpose of a toy is to make whatever you can dream up, regardless of whether it exists in the real world."

pics,3c77pc,SeriousMichael,Demographics. At the end of the day Lego is a corporation and they probably have scores of people whose only place in this world is to study sales and demographics and suggest business models which conform to these demographics to sell more products.\n\nIt's not about forcing little Jenny to buy pink Lego and it's not about forcing little Jimmy to buy spacemen. It's about demographics and profits.

pics,3c77pc,holdenismyhomeboy,"I wish they would have had these when I was a kid. I was super girly and, while my brother had a bunch of things you could actually build, all I had was a bucket of spare Lego parts. I wanted to build sets but nothing they had interested me. I didn't want rockets or pirates. I wanted to build houses and pink castles. \n\nThese days I see all the Lego sets that are more gender neutral or aimed at girls and I wish they had them when I was 8 or so. I don't know why everyone is fine with masculine toys but not girly ones. People are quick to demonize pink and fluffy but not stereotypically masculine things that have that textured metal print or are violent and clearly aimed at boys. It's fine to be a little girl (or boy) want to be girly, just like it's fine to not want to be girly."

pics,3c77pc,aveganliterary,"Apart from the people-figures (which I hate) the sets aren't even that girly. At least to the point where it would be weird for a boy to play with them too. What's wrong with a hotel, or a hot air balloon, or a smoothie stand? They have animal sets (of which my son has many) which are great because basic LEGO sets rarely have any animals except dogs and sharks. \n\nThe best part is that even though the bricks are pastel, they fit with regular LEGO so you can easily make all the sets less feminine by just swapping out some of the pieces (obviously easier to do if you have multiple kids or an enormous collection like my family)."

Not all girls like babydolls - I had a healthy Tonka truck collection.  But you know what I did with my matchbox cars?  I had them play act and talk to each other and have whole little soap operas.  Driving them never occurred to me.  I owned them for years and they looked mint condition after 100s of hours of playing.  It's like 70s parents took it a little too far.  Not like it damaged me, but some boy/girl traits are born, not taught."

pics,3c77pc,lisabauer58,"You are very correct about the 70s.  We tried to undo stereotyping.  Things like pink and blue were considered a problem.   Little girls could wear pants and we encouraged children to cry if they needed to, even the boys. \n\nWe did carry it to far though.  We kinda was throwing the baby out with the bath water.  We were liberal and we ended up raising conservative children.  We were the generation of hippys raising kids.  That's why the show Family Matters was so popular in the 80s.  :)\n\nBut we were also the generation that began recyclying, fighting for the rights of woman to work outside their homes, trying to raise children as humans instead of by sex, and we pushed for sexual equality.  We pushed for the pill.  We changed laws so woman through divorce woukdnt get shafted and was able to keep their children as it was common for men to dictate the terrms of divorce.  We were the generation that was willing to impeach a President because he broke the laws. Gone were the days that only boys took wood shop while girls choose dance or home economic.  \n\nWe were gutsy and even though we had very good intentions we didn't always do things that helped.  We were the generation that pulled the bandaid off of the social norm and it hurt like hell\n\nThank you for writting the truth and putting to bed the myth of the 70s that people today seem to have. ;)\n\nI put my daughter into a sharp looking suit to attend a wedding.  She looked smashing but she was angry with me.  She wanted a fancy dress. :)."
pics,3c77pc,lumaga,Why didn't you put her in a dress like she wanted and is socially expected?
pics,3c77pc,lisabauer58,"Because it was socially acceptable in the 70s to be none gender.  She didn't wear a suit and tie kind of thing.  She wore dress blue jeans and a jacket.  She had a lace shirt under the jacket.  Her blonde hair was pulled up into a bun  on top of her head, a strand of pearls around her neck and she wore flat dress shoes.  Wouldn't you say that sounds socially acceptable?  :). And she was six years old."
pics,3c77pc,Purpleheart111,"Honestly if she wanted to go in a fancy dress you should have let her wear one , forcing your kids to go against social norms is just as bad as forcing them into social norms. I am agaisnt forcing a child to express themselves in a way which they do that want whether it's being forced to go with or against social normes, if its going against what the child wants its equally wrong."

pics,3c77pc,lalalava,"Okay anecdote for anecdote then. Our parents got me (female btw) and my sister both types of toys - masculine and feminine. We did things like make towns out of Lincoln Logs and electric train kits, where our Beanie Babies lived and had elections each month. We would make Yoshi families out of pompoms and pipe cleaners to live there too. Our favorite Polly Pocket set was the C3PO. With our K'nex I tried to make life-size robots and then got frustrated when they didn't come to life. \n\nAs an adult, I went onto do robotics research in Japan and am now working towards my STEM PhD. I am happy to enjoy hobbies stereotyped to both genders - baking, makeup, but also post-hardcore music and finding video game glitches. I am forever grateful to my parents letting me explore as a kid without gendered expectations."

pics,3c77pc,Zephs,"Even monkeys choose toys with a gender preference, so it's highly unlikely that human socialization is the driving force behind it. It's more likely cyclical. There's a biological draw for most boys to go for certain types of toys. and girls for other types. This is then reinforced through socialization. Parents are more likely to buy toys for the child and play with the child in a way that's gender-conforming because it usually works, so the child would enjoy it even more than non-gender-conforming toys."

The idea that gender is solely due to socialization is pretty robustly shown to be false. It wouldn't explain why those preferences are the same pretty much everywhere in the world, for instance. There's clearly some kind of biological draw to it, even now.\n\nThere are actually quite a few, if you want to check them out for yourself: https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&q=monkey+gender+preference+toys&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_sdtp="
pics,3c77pc,deadowl,Has the study's results been reproduced?\nWere the monkeys in the study isolated from human socialization?\n\n\nHuman development studies are very hard because you can't ethically prevent a kid from experiencing parental and other societal influences as they grow up.\n\nAt the same time transgender evidence is harder to dismiss because they go through the same social experience and conform to the opposite.
pics,3c77pc,Zephs,"I posted two links. The first was a single study, the second was a Google Scholar search showing a list of studies that were similar. \n\nThe idea that gender is a social construction made by humans is quickly becoming debunked. It's reinforced in a lot of ways, but it's becoming pretty clear it's based on biology."

The parents pushed for anatomical proper dolls, and bans on weapons like toy guns.  (we were convienced that if children didn't play with guns they would grow up kinder but what we found out was anything would become a gun.  Even a finger.  Pow! :)\n\nI find it so interesting that people today have all these ideas of who people were in the past.  The 70s opened doors for all the generastions to come.  The 70s was the generation of hippys having children and we planned on doing things different than our parents generation.

pics,3c8avo,IAmAWhiteTeenager,"This pattern is called piebald, and occurs in many other animals too. Here's a piebald deer and a python. It's actually been bred into horses, which are known as paint horses, and is where most people see the pattern."
pics,3c8avo,Theral,"Also exciting: gynandromorphism in animals where both the male and female color morphs are expressed (because the animal is half male, half female)."
pics,3c8avo,CleverDuck,"Isn't piebald patterning more irregular, sort of a spotted or splotchy pattern? I think this is an example of chimeraism, where an albino-expressing zygote and a ""normal"" wild type zygote have fused into one organism...."

pics,3c8760,PurpEL,What's the difference? Honest question.
pics,3c8760,vigridarena,"One is belt driven much like power steering/ac/alternator, and one is exhaust driven. Turbos usually need time to create pressure, known as lag. Superchargers at instant power but eat hp to run. Superchargers on v8 muscle cars usually stick out of the hood much like mad max's"
pics,3c8760,PurpEL,"Superchargers don't usually stick up and out of the hood. Back in the day they did often times, but you would almost never see a supercharger with the hood closed nowdays. They are the same size as a turbo if centrifugal. If not, the twin screw or roots are usually tucked neatly under the hood, in some cases a cowl vent hood is used.\n\nA turbo runs off of exhaust coming from the engine to turn the turbo therefore spinning the turbine to suck air in and push it into the engine. A supercharger is doing the same thing belt driven and not based on exhaust."
pics,3c8760,dustballer,"That's why I said ""Superchargers on v8 muscle cars usually stick out of the hood much like mad max's"" as in classic muscle cars... Blowers like Weiand.. You don't need to be pedantic and pick apart my brief overview for someone that was curious."

pics,3c8760,iamkokonutz,The dog mountain fire near port Alberni is causing the majority of the haze in port Alberni to parksville. The sky is the colour of honey. And I had to clear ash from my truck this morning.
pics,3c8760,TwerkBench,I don't think that's true. Most of the smoke covering port Alberni and the rest of the island is coming from fires on the mainland. I watched it roll into the Alberni valley from the east (opposite direction than sproat lake) first thing this morning. Looked like a bank of brown clouds rolling across the sky.
pics,3c8760,Dusty_Bottoms,The Alberni valley is definitely mostly the result of Dog Mountain and Nanaimo. My family has a cabin on Sproat and the entire valley (all the way to taylor river) is golden honey and ash is building up in places.

pics,3c8760,Schinus99,forest fires are actually pretty common near vancouver area in summer. we get lots of rain in fall/ winter/ spring.. but july through september is usually bone dry and southern BC is a hotspot for forest fires.

pics,3c7lj1,SexyToby,Yep. It has still held onto the meaning even though it is largely symbolic. I've seen people use an upside down flag as a way to comment on the overall well-being of the country. I think this kind of mentality is what makes it a taboo thing to do.

pics,3c7lj1,jonasbeaver,"The funny thing about the french flag is the cocarde tricolore -  the french flag in a disk form if you like,  often used in military markings for instance;  it is strickingly similar to the Royal Air Force roundels except for one important detail (the French cocarde has a blue center,  the RAF roundels a red center).\n\nThe French often get this one wrong though.  The most amusing incident about this was when the French celebrated the bicentenary of their revolution - I mean they didn't just got the date wrong (but that's another story),  they got their own flag wrong: the whole capital was decorated with Royal Air Force roundels rather than the French cocarde - the Queen who was in attendance managed to keep a straight face throughout the whole show,  which  was  quite remarkable :-)"

pics,3ca4in,msdd2727,How about trash?

pics,3ca4in,Jennica,Things I've heard people say to justify littering: \n\nThey pay people to pick this shit up. \n\nWhatever. \n\nThere isn't a trash can around here. \n\nEverything is biodegradable.

pics,3ca4in,MaXiMiUS,Paper towels degrade way faster than 2-4 weeks. Seen one degrade in a matter of seconds in the rain.
pics,3ca4in,JafBot,HE SEENT IT!!!
pics,3ca4in,sizzleRiiiP,And your anecdote automatically overturns the scientific advisary document created by the New Hampshire governmental department for Environmental Sciences.\n\nThat is the power of a reddit account compared to a team of master's degrees and doctorates.
pics,3ca4in,Crusader1089,I don't doubt the numbers if you are going for complete breakdown.  But if you have you ever picked up trash along a highway stuff like plastic bags become lots of thin pieces of plastic after not too much time (month or 2) from UV degradation.
pics,3ca4in,sngx1275,How did you time how long ago the bags found the side of the highway as their new home?
pics,3ca4in,falling_candy,"Don't be a douche.  There are somewhat regular highway cleanups in the area, so its a fairly good estimate in the couple to few month range.  If you live in an area that gets a lot of sunlight plastic bags get shredded by the sun - don't believe me?  Go pick up trash along the highway, or just tie a bag up outside and watch."
pics,3ca4in,sngx1275,"Well, I'm working on a doctorate in ecology, and I kind of have to agree with /u/MaXiMiUS and /u/JafBot. \n\nFirst off, what is the environment? Decomposition in a wetland takes way longer than decomposition on the rainforest floor. Hence the buildup of peat in bogs. The URL says ""marine debris"", so I assume these times are for in the ocean, but even that can be pretty variable.\n\nSecondly, what do they mean by ""decompose""? Jafbot mentions seeing a paper towel degrade in seconds in the rain. It's likely that whoever figured out these numbers meant something more extreme than breaking down to the point that the remaining pieces are too small to see with the naked eye, but do they mean something as extreme as breaking down until every atom has been incorporated into living matter? \n\nWe really need the peer reviewed article with methods section here. I mean, obviously most if not all of these are estimates. No one sat around for 450 years watching bottles degrade. How did they come up with these estimates? I have done work on organic matter processing in tropical streams (read: leaf decomposition rates). We do estimates sometimes and calculate what is known as the ""k"" rate, which is essentially the exponent in the exponential decay function. I would like to know what k is for these items.\n\n\nteam of masters degrees and doctorates\n\n\nMore like maybe one masters student, or one doctoral student (probably the former though), and some undergrad summer labor (like maybe 1 REU student). I wish we lived in a world where we could hire a team of people with masters and doctoral degrees for stuff like this though."
pics,3ca4in,Crunkenstien,This guy knows what he's talking about. I went to clean up some water the other day and my paper towel just disappeared from my hand!

pics,3ca4in,foods_that_are_round,That's not relevant - because banana peel attracts vermin. I once challenged a guy who threw some into a garden area at a local rail station - made him pick it up. He gave me all that biodegradable bullshit too. Who wants rats all over the fucking place I asked him? (To be honest I also offered to throw him on to some railings - may have convinced him).  I truly believe it is YOUR responsibility to smack the head of anyone who litters.

pics,3ca4in,imanasshole2,"I'm guessing you're getting instant downvotes because the person above you said ""I never leave a mess"" and you started with ""my friends and I always do because were drunk and tired"" and people just assumed you don't cleanup the mess at all :x"
pics,3ca4in,jld2k6,"The beef is your reasonable and completely logical response removes the opportunity for illogical emotional outrage against the entirety of humanity which this post evokes.\n\nIt also makes it completely silly. If you approached someone in the manner of many of these comments, and someone said ""Well I'm going to clean it up in the morning. How in the hell do you expect me to adequately pick up 1000000 tiny pieces of paper and debris in the dark?"" Those people would look pretty damn silly. Almost as though, they're controlled by their emotions instead of their brains."
pics,3ca4in,Webonics,Same here. At my old house we would shoot off a good number of fireworks. We also lived on a hill so we had a great view of the county fireworks and would normally have a pretty big crowd in our back yard. We would normally shoot ours off before the county fireworks and when the county fireworks were over people would leave and everyone would be tired. My parents would go to bed while I stayed up with friends all hours of the night. Come morning my dad already had the place cleaned up for the most part.
pics,3ca4in,mrbubbles916,"I do wonder though if leaving it, even for just 12 hours or so, poses higher risks to the surrounding wildlife. When just grabbing it right after you're done and tossing it in a trash bag is such an easy thing to do, even drunk, I guess I don't see much point in waiting until the next day or day after that."

pics,3ca4in,Wolfy21_,"Well depending on where you are it may not be there in the morning;  carried off in the wind, taken out to sea by the tide, just because you don't notice some of it is missing the next day doesn't mean it's not a problem. It's seriously not hard to pick up your trash even if you're drunk, and if you leave so much shit behind you get your friends to help out."
pics,3ca4in,Krabban,"I have seen more than one trash fire started by people throwing away fireworks. Unless you soak them completely in water, which makes them a huge mess to clean up, it's best to clean them up in the morning."

pics,3c9ep1,_real_talk_,"Yes, that is for what is called a fixed platform, so the legs will set on the sea-bead.  Good write up on wikipedia about different types of drilling rigs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_platform.\n\nCould be set as deep as 1700 FT.  Generally used for shallow water. A topsides unit will be installed on top for either drilling, production or drilling and production.  When this is set into place it will stay for 20-30 yrs and drill/produce oil from multiple wells.  The area it will be set in is most likely already known for oil deposits so its feasible to put this unit in and leave it for a long time.  In comparison, floating drilling units will move to different locations every 3-6 months drilling exploratory type wells."

The only upside is that to get on one all you need is to know someone and the pay is actually pretty great, but the downside is if a fire breaks out then your options is to either die by fire, die by jumping straight off the rig, or take the risk of using their sad escape methods and hope help can arrive in time before you have to eat the smallest mother fucker on the life raft."

The biggest guy will have enough to keep the rest alive for much longer.  \n\nEating smallest --> biggest in order just means you have to kill more people in less time, just leaving one fat bastard left at the end. Biggest --> smallest order means you can survive longer with slightly less brutal murder.\n\nYeah the biggest guy might be strongest (or just fat perhaps) but the other 4 would probably be able to take him down."

The deepest they go is ~250m, deeper than that it's usually more economical to use a floating platform thats tethered to the seafloor.\n\nThe jackets will be transported from the fabrication yard (many jackets are fabricated in Korea) to the site and simply tipped off the back of the barge (known as a launch installation), which is almost certainly how this jacket was installed, given its size. They can be lifted into place with heavy lift vessels but its fairly uncommon.\n\nSource: Offshore Structural Engineer, I design these things for a living"

The legs are flooded once the jacket is in positioned properly with tug boats to sink it.\n\nThe topsides are then installed by lifting in to place with a heavy lift vessel or a a floatover installation. With a floatover the topsides will be on a similar vessel which is positioned between the legs of the installed jacket. The vessel then partially sinks itself to lower the topside onto the jacket which is then welded in to place.\n\nSource: I design these"

pics,3c8b86,pdy18,"Nope. I'm in Austin, where we have plenty. Grew up all my life around them. Just avoid them. They're not out to seek humans. They're indigenous species.\n\nKinda like this"
pics,3c8b86,i_will_cut_jew,No I meant the author of the link you have. I read the entire article. It describes forced perception well with accurate examples

pics,3c8b86,Random_Link_Roulette,"Yeah. They're docile enough, they have no real reason to bite you unless they feel threatened. The rattles make them one of the less dangerous venomous snakes, as you can usually tell when your about to piss one off.\n\nAlso, I thought I was supposed to call you Arizonian. I feel oddly disappointed."
pics,3c8b86,LacidOnex,"You can, also acceptable is Zonies. \n\nAll 3 though are fine while -nian is the more common one. \n\nBut ya, rattlers rattle for a reason and that reason is ""fuck off cunt, this is my patch"""

pics,3c8b86,rockjb,"i saw this exact picture in an email thread about 8-10 years ago, probably why its hard to find the source."
pics,3c8b86,hahnemannpa,This is a 6 foot rattlesnake.  \n\nhttp://1ywpi925eu8i25ne6noy0131.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/snake-11.jpg
pics,3c8b86,adamlee05,"So is this:\nhttp://imgur.com/ZsXRNLI\n\nLook at the angle he's holding the stick, and its fairly long.\n\nPerspective."
pics,3c8b86,beefinbed,"The stick is starting at waist high and he is elevating it to be level with the top of his head.\nAssuming this dude is around 5'8""ish or more, that forced perspective is still dismissing a lot of length if you think that snake is 6 feet. The girth may look more massive, but it doesn't change the fact that the snake is still nearly touching the ground when being held at head height of the man holding it."
pics,3c8b86,alijimando,"It's not level with the top of his head, that's how the perspective fools you. With how long the stick is, the snake is a good 4 or 5 feet in front of the guy. The camera is being held at about waist height or maybe a bit above the waist. \n\nSay the snake is halfway between the camera and the guy, then the top of the stick is about halfway between his head and waist. That would make the snake closer to the 6-7 foot range in length."
pics,3c8b86,Swaggineer,"To me it looks like the tip of the snakes tail is right on the ground next to the dudes foot. If that's true, I'd say it's a pretty large snake that isn't more than 1 ft in front of him."
pics,3c8b86,acomputer1,"But that's our point. Its tail isn't on the ground right next to him, its just meant to look that way."
pics,3c8b86,beefinbed,I'm still gonna say it's bigger. But I am dick at geometry and the low camera angle makes sense.
pics,3c8b86,u_should_be_on_voat,He looks about 3 feet tall. Your math adds up.
pics,3c8b86,MYTBUSTOR,"It's called a forced perspective, the snake is a few feet in front of the person so it looks a lot longer than it would be if they were the same distance from the camera, to test this place your left hand about 6 inches away from your head, place your right hand 12 inches away from your left hand so that you can see both of them, now compare the sizes, congrats now it looks like one of your hands is half the size."
pics,3c8b86,adamlee05,See edit. My math does add up.
pics,3c8b86,nickglowsindark,"Take a look at every fisherman ever who's photographed himself holding a giant fish.  The trick is always to compare the size of the fish to the fingertips, because the ""well known trick"" is to hold the fish right in front of the camera to make it look bigger.  Using a stick like this, it's super-easy to make the snake look gigantic.  I'm fairly  well-informed when it comes to reptiles, and while an 11-foot rattlesnake isn't an impossibility, that's definitely not what this is.  Look at the tip of the tail in comparison to how the man is standing- it's totally a perspective trick."
pics,3c8b86,Maligned-Instrument,This trick is also used by deer hunters to make the antlers look bigger on a buck.
pics,3c8b86,gthank,"I'm pretty sure the largest accepted report of a Western Diamondback is ~7ft, so 11 ft seems vanishingly unlikely."
pics,3c8b86,Nman77,"...do we measure rattlesnakes only when they're folded in half? Cus then yeah, it's 6 feet."
pics,3c8b86,el_crunz,"Unless that stick the guy is holding is really long, 11 feet is not out of the question."
pics,3c8b86,doodiejoe,I wouldn't suggest using a short stick
pics,3c8b86,fuckevrythngabouthat,Rattlesnakes simply don't grow that big. It's a fact. Largest was 7.8ft killed in the 40s
pics,3c8b86,adamlee05,It's entirely out of the question. Forced perspective.
pics,3c8b86,HippoLips,"Same thing goes on in porn, nothing to see here....."
pics,3c8b86,coffeeffoc,"Look at the number of rattles on that tail... that is a very large snake regardless of perspective and certainly larger than 6-7 feet, from my experience."
pics,3c8b86,kildis92,"Rattles do not have any direct relation to size only that the snake has shed, they also break off at times etc."
pics,3c8b86,coffeeffoc,They do break off at times but there is relation to growth rate and that one doesn't look broken.
pics,3c8b86,Crotalus,"You have never seen a snake larger than 7'. People generally suck at telling sizes, and with snakes, they tend to round up and be more confident in the bad estimate (currently involved with a research project that will document this). 4' would be a good sized diamondback."

pics,3c8b86,improbablewobble,"As a Texan who has come across a three foot rattlesnake and nearly shit my pants, I would have blown a fucking gasket out of my ass if I saw this.\n\nAlso, baby rattlesnakes are worse, because they release more venom, just FYI.\n\nEdit: Fuck me in the ass I'm just repeating old wives tales I was told. Also, I only mentioned Texas because it's in the title. Wasn't claiming it made me an expert."
pics,3c8b86,snakesandstuff,"The baby rattlesnakes being worse b/c they release more venom is an old wives tail and is incorrect.\n\nDrop for drop, the potency between an adult and juvie rattlesnake should be considered the same for all practical purposes. The adults have a MUCH larger venom yield. The part about ""babies"" not knowing how much to inject is BS.\n\nA bite from a large rattlesnake is typically more serious than that of a small rattlesnake."
pics,3c8b86,fireinthesky7,Is it not true that you're less likely to get a dry bite with a juvenile?
pics,3c8b86,snakesandstuff,"The logic behind it is shaky, and there is no real evidence to suggest it."
pics,3c8b86,RobaDubDub,I heard that they are basically blind when they are born so they are more apt to strike at any noise that gets close they also don't have rattles yet so they can't warn you off. This is why they are considered more dangerous I think.
pics,3c8b86,Crotalus,That's a new one. Also false.

pics,3c8b86,Crotalus,I have a couple of gravid females right now that should give birth any day. I'll post some photos so you can see the prebutton and big eyes :)
pics,3c8b86,snakesandstuff,They can see just fine when they are first born. They go through a shed cycle in about a week (I've kept/bred many rattlesnake species).\n\nThe babies are in no way more dangerous than the adults.
pics,3c8b86,RobaDubDub,"Dang, I have been misled from childhood."
pics,3c8b86,KeiffDaBeef,They haven't developed full control of their fangs and venom glands. When they bite the babies dump all the venom they can in one strike.
pics,3c8b86,snakesandstuff,"This is also an old wives tale. There is no scientific proof to back it up, and plenty of accounts of bites on humans vs size of snake to dispute it."
pics,3c8b86,Crotalus,This is a myth.
pics,3c8b86,gthank,A more realistic concern with baby snakes—and those wretched pigmy rattlers—is they are WAY harder to spot than a 6-footer.
pics,3c8b86,Crotalus,"It's not that big.\n\nI'm not sure why this is such a thing, but 'Texas' has nothing at all to do with knowledge of or expertise in anything to do with snakes. In fact it seems to indicate the opposite.\n\nThe 'fact' about the baby snakes is a myth. See my previous point."

pics,3c8b86,TexasTmac,"Since I moved out of rural West Texas, I don't encounter them much. That being said, if I found one in/around my house where it could hurt my family or pets, it died. If I saw one out away from everything, I just minded my own and made sure I didn't find any of his buddies."

pics,3c8b86,GoddamitMrNoodle,"If you encounter a rattlesnake that is warning you to back off, and is rattling loudly, just leave it alone. Too many of the loud rattlesnakes are being killed resulting in only the quiet rattlesnakes surviving and procreating."
pics,3c8b86,i_will_cut_jew,Exactly. It's an indigenous species that don't go out of their way to make contact with and attack human population. Their rattle is only a warning to back off.

He was shown/sent the picture from people he met on/near the tracks he did not take the picture and he sent me the picture.

pics,3c8b86,Mandalf_the_Ghey,Of course they killed it
pics,3c8b86,mynameiswrong,You're 3x more likely to be killed by a dog than a snake in the USA but can you imagine the uproar if someone posted a picture of someone posing with a large dog they found and killed.
pics,3c8b86,Sorta_Kinda,"It may not kill you but it will definitely kill your pets. Why don't you post the numbers on that, too?"
pics,3c8b86,mynameiswrong,"What makes you say definitely? It definitely has a slight chance of killing your pet. Best I could do \n\n""You won’t find details on the numbers of dogs bitten, or killed, by venomous snakes, though. I asked Michael Schaer, DVM, Professor of Veterinary Internal Medicine at the University of Florida, College of Veterinary Medicine, about the numbers of dogs bitten or killed by snakes in the U.S. ""I don't believe we have a valid source of information on the actual numbers of dogs bitten or killed by snakes annually in the United States,"" he explained, ""because there is no central data resource for this."" In his twenty-two years as the lead clinician handling snake bites at the veterinary school, Dr. Schaer estimates about a 20 percent fatality rate for dogs bitten by the Eastern Diamondback and the Eastern Coral snakes.""\n\n""What is the prognosis for your pet if is bitten by a venomous snake? The majority of pets will be uncomfortable and swollen for several days. The skin around the bite may become discolored and in some animals the skin will slough several days later. Most pets will stay in the hospital for observation for 12-24 hours and then go home with appropriate medications once they are deemed stable and their pain can be managed at home. More severe cases may require hospitalization for several days. If the skin around the bite does slough, additional veterinary care will be needed. """
pics,3c8b86,Sorta_Kinda,"My point is, I live in Texas and I can say that it is not uncommon to hear of rattlesnakes killing people's pets. It's more frequent than human bites obviously and I would say it's an issue."
pics,3c8b86,mako98,And how frequent is it that a dog kills a cat/other dog? Snakes get the shit end of the stick most of the time for no reason.

pics,3c8b86,HippoLips,Or another person
pics,3c8b86,mandysauras_rex,"If a rattlesnake got this big (11 ft or not) it's because it's been keeping VERMIN AND GROSS DISEASE-CARRYING ANIMALS THE FUCK AWAY FROM YOU. I hope this big tough man is fucking proud of himself for killing it. You leave them alone, and they will not only leave YOU alone, but they'll eat all the dirty rodents that make us sick. \n\nIf you live in an area where rattlesnakes are prevelant, how about taking some responsibility and putting your dog thru rattlesnake avoidance training? Snakes help people out way more than we realize. I hope this guy's house gets flooded with all the rats and mice that aren't getting eaten now."
pics,3c8b86,HippoLips,humans fuck up the balance of nature
pics,3c8b86,marbledog,"I hope this guy's house gets flooded with all the rats and mice that aren't getting eaten now.\n\n\nThat would be about 4 mice per year. Rattlesnakes have remarkably low metabolisms. They eat an average of 40% of their body weight per year. Let's assume that snake is the largest on record, 4.5kg and was near the end of a 20 year lifespan. That gives it an yearly average of 90g of consumption - about 4-5 mice. Towards the end of his life, he would consume an average of 1.8kg of food per year - roughly one rabbit. \n\nIf you feel like the animal shouldn't be killed because you respect its value as a living thing, I can't argue with that, but the ""snakes are helpful because they kill vermin"" argument just doesn't check out."
pics,3c8b86,Ganja_all_day,This is a very interesting fact. Thank you for teaching me something today u/marbledog
pics,3c8b86,mandysauras_rex,"I honestly have no idea where you pulled '4 mice per year' from, but that is an impressively low number. Obviously, his house being ""flooded"" was a hyperbolic statement and I assumed it would be taken as such. On average, a snake should be eating a meal about the size of his girth once a week. This is obviously going to fluctuate, depending on the season, size of snake, size of actual prey, availability of said prey, environmental conditions, etc. You can't deny the positive benifit that snakes have on rodent populations, and I would love to hear from from a vemomologist or herpetologist about a snake this size CONSISTANTLY surviving on an average of 4 mice every year. If that's the case, this snake is eating fewer mice than can be produced in ONE LITTER....call me crazy, but i don't see all those extra mice running around. I'm not sure what your credentials are, but from my meager 5 years of working side by side and getting experience with rattlers, other snakes, and the people who raise them, I call bullshit."
pics,3c8b86,marbledog,"I honestly have no idea where you pulled '4 mice per year' from...\n\n\nI cited the source and explained the math. The figure is an estimate of average consumption over the lifespan of the animal, assuming a consistent growth rate. Obviously, it would eat much more towards the end of its life, as I noted."
pics,3c8b86,Xenominer,There is no snake that would eat 4 mice per year. Ever. Not even juveniles eating pinkies added up to 'full mouse size'.\n\nI question the credibility of whoever authored this source info.\n\nAlso - how did you work this math? 40% of 4.5KG is nowhere near 90g.

pics,3c8b86,gthank,"I can think of any number of reasons: it was killing livestock (edit: meaning chickens, most likely), he almost stepped on it and killed it while freaking out, he realized it was—literally—a cold-blooded killer that would bite him or anybody else that stumbled on it… the list sort of writes itself.\n\nEDIT: Just to update, I mean literally stumbled upon it. Rattlers are actually very pleasant in that they usually warn you, but if you catch one unawares and step on it because its natural camoflauge is working too well, then you stand a very good chance of being bitten. Even when it doesn't kill you (which is dependent on all sorts of variables, but is not the most common outcome), that is nobody's idea of a good time."

Most of the time, you don't even see the things until you're practically on top of them (that pattern on their backs is really good camo in most of the southern US), and if you practically stepped on an 11-foot long venomous killing machine, you'd probably kill it if you could."

pics,3c9seu,citizen_coping,"""The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.""\n\n\nDavid Foster Wallace"

pics,3c9seu,swareonmemum,"just recently I had a friend overdose in a sober living house I was staying at. It's so creepy actually seeing a dead body in real life. There's such an eerie feel to it, the entire room is enveloped in emptiness. It is something I wish upon no one. One thing that really helped for me was changing the room around and changing the smell. I know it sounds weird but there was an air freshener we used in every room, and whenever I smelled it, it reminds of what happened. Just try and change everything you can that you sensed in that moment so you aren't thinking about it more than you should. In the meantime just talk about it with someone. Let it out, don't hold back anything at all. I was so fucking mad at my friend for using, and mad that I couldn't do anything even though I was right downstairs when it happened. Don't blame yourself and try and use his life and what he taught you and the memories you share together as a driving point in your life. Best wishes my friend."

pics,3c9seu,GreyMatter22,i don't think it sounds insincere... i think it's quite nice.
pics,3c9seu,ShadowLTDS,"I agree that what he wrote doesn't sound insincere, but when you lose someone really close to you it can kind of blend together into what everyone else says. The ""I'm sorry for your loss"" thing can almost start to seem automatic, reflexive, like how if someone sneezes someone will say ""Bless you."" It can just become watered down and the sound track to your bereavement. I personally know because I lost my mom when I was 15 years old.\n\nWhat I tend to say to people now is what /u/RealityGenius opened with: There are no magic words that will make anything better. That's about the sincerest thing people would tell me when my mom died. But really, in general it didn't matter what anyone said to me really, all that I really needed was something to effectively show me I'm being supported. ""I'm sorry for your loss"" can definitely be able to do that, but it can also definitely not portray that as well when it just comes across as the ""bless you"" of loss."
pics,3c9seu,race-hearse,"Agreed. As someone who also lost their mother at 15, a lot of responses do start to blend together. The best people are the ones who don't try to make it okay, rather than try to blow it off with ""I'm sorry"" and whatnot. They admit that no, no it's not okay, and let you know that they're there for you. Even if there's absolutely nothing they can do, it's still letting you know that you have support.\n\nSo OP, no, it's not okay. But we're here if you need to talk. Sometimes it's infinitely easier to open up to a stranger than someone you actually know."
pics,3c9seu,michiness,"That is incredibly sincere and heartfelt. Posts like this makes me have faith in humanity and is another reason why I love this community. \n\nI too lost a girlfriend about 14 years ago. I was broken. I let it get to me and I closed off from the world. Let this post and others like it, people wanting to help, and family help you. I didn't and I paid the price. People only want to help and try to understand your pain. Don't get upset with them for saying what they try to put across as attempts to understand your pain. Let them in and help you heal. \n\nI'm sorry for your pain but let her live in your heart and you try to move on in time. All the best, friend."

pics,3c9seu,Heysoos_Christo,"“Alright, here goes. I’m old. What that means is that I’ve survived (so far) and a lot of people I’ve known and loved did not. I’ve lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can’t imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here’s my two cents.\n\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don’t want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don’t want it to “not matter”. I don’t want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gorged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can’t see.\n\nAs for grief, you’ll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you’re drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it’s some physical thing. Maybe it’s a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it’s a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don’t even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you’ll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what’s going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything…and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\n\nSomewhere down the line, and it’s different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O’Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you’ll come out.\n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don’t really want them to. But you learn that you’ll survive them. And other waves will come. And you’ll survive them too. If you’re lucky, you’ll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.”\n\nThis is some old reddit lore that I read one time and feel compelled to pass on to others.

I don't know who you are or what your situation is so barring that one of you are married already: just go for it. \n\nMy husband and I were dirt poor when we got engaged. I'm not talking about ""oh we have just a little bit of money, but we'll make it work."" Literally, owed our landlord over $2,000 in back rent on our wedding day.  \n\nWhen you are poor life is difficult.  We are young, and we are (still) poor.  We were petrified to tell my family we were getting married for a million reasons.  First, because we were poor. Two, because I was twenty-one at the time. Three, because I have ten very serious illnesses and I live in America so the idea of not being able to pay my medical bills and living on my own was a terrifying idea. \n\nBut guess what? You figure it out.  Life happens and you figure it out.  Sometimes it gets really fucking hard and you fight a bit, but our wedding day was the happiest day of my life. It was beautiful and it was cheap! Our wedding rings cost us $70.  \n\nNever let life get in the way of living."
pics,3c9seu,liberaces_taco,"Sort of similar situation.  I've been married to the most wonderful woman for just over a year now (one year anniversary was June 21st).  I can't imagine losing her.  She also has the BRCA1 genetic mutation, which causes a 50-80% chance of breast canncer and a 40% chance of ovarian cancer over her lifetime.  A double mastectomy brought the chance of breast cancer down to 5%.  We have to wait 10 or 15 years for the next surgery to remove the risk of ovarian cancer.  Ovarian is so damn hard to catch early, and there are other smaller risks too.  Sucks."

pics,3c9seu,ThrowDown__ThrowAway,It is absolutely insane how normalised car crashes are. They kill tens of thousands of healthy people in the western world every year and injure hundreds of thousands. If anything else was that likely to cause an accident it would have been banned years ago. We really have to reduce the number of cars and not build a transportation network based on the most dangerous way possible to travel.
pics,3c9seu,kristallklocka,It's the most dangerous way possible to travel because it is the most common. Not necessarily because cars are inherently trying to kill you.
pics,3c9seu,Soulcrux,"Hmm I think I'd need some further convincing on that one. I feel that the total utility gained by having the significant freedom of car travel, on the macro level, outweigh the effects of accidents at their current frequencies. Otherwise we wouldn't be driving cars. Although we as a race should always be striving for better solutions."
pics,3c9seu,mister_head_cheese,"Young and visibly healthy means little.  In OP's case it was apparently a car crash, but it could be aggressive cancer uncaught until it's too late, or a stroke, or a genetic defect, or any one of a thousand different things you'd never see or expect.\n\nIn the end, we only have this one life and the people we love in it.  Some are there for longer than others, and some leave way too soon.  All we can do is love them while we have them, and remember them when they're gone.  If we're lucky, they outlive us.

At the end of the day when my mom went home or to bed or whatever, and I was sitting alone with my phone, that silence could get really really hard to take."

pics,3c9seu,surfinbari88,"As someone who has recently lost a best friend all I can say is while it does get easier, the dreams will get you. Both ones where they come back and ones where they never died. Waking up is the hardest part. I send you my best wishes and most sincere apologies. \nAnd offer up an ear, if you ever need to vent. Just talking about it always helps.\nI would love to hear your story."
pics,3c9seu,stoawayaccount,"I try to be honest to people about death... I don't know exact circumstances for others, but my dad died and nothing got better. The years that followed were terrible, we struggled financially and lost close relationships with family and friends. Only now, 5 years later, have things started to pick up again.\n\nEDIT: To touch up on what you said, I totally agree. I remember vivid dreams and waking up breathing heavily and super confused only to find out it's not reality. One of mine was seeing my dad pull up and pick me up from school and I freaked out and was asking him all these questions and hugging him. He told me he faked it for financial reasons or something. The dream felt unsettlingly real, and then I woke up."

pics,3c9seu,blurgtheamoeba,"The dreams. I know what you mean. But sometimes you go to sleep hoping that you dream about them; you see them so much clearer in dreams than you ever could in your conscious mind/memories. \nLost a best friend a few years ago. Cancer sucks, man."
pics,3c9seu,XLpho,"I can't tell you if this is true or not. What I can tell you is it's posts like this that make me realise how many people don't understand grief.  \n\nI'm not saying I'm a psychologist, but I have had the misfortune of losing multiple family members in the somewhat short 25 years I've been alive. I've lost someone sudden and I've lost people to cancer. And every time I grieved differently.  \n\nGrief is not something that can be measured, there is no wrong way to grieve (unless it involves hurting yourself). Many people feel hugely isolated when someone dies and reaching out to strangers and letting them know what has happened can help some people. When someone close to you dies, there are a lot of other people around you that are hurting. Everyone is dealing with it differently and sometimes being the one who is more visibly emotional can be difficult around a more stoic group for example.  \n\nI am not saying that posting on Reddit is the best healer, but hearing how sorry people are for your loss, and having them tell you how strong you are, can help you get through the day.  \n\nWhen my Dad died, I was 19. He had cancer but was only diagnosed 5 weeks before he died. I was with him every day and watched him die. Me and my siblings went to the pub after he died. Literally an hour after he died. I knew more of his friends than anyone else so it was my job to call everyone and tell them he died. So there we were, me and my siblings, sitting in a pub and calling all of my dads friends to tell them he died. I didn't cry for 2 weeks, but I was angry. I was angry that not everyone knew he was dead, that people dared to laugh WHEN MY DAD HAD JUST DIED, it wasn't fair that they were happy.  \n\nWhen my sister died, it was 10 months ago. She went to work one day, there was an explosion, and she didn't come home. My brother told me via Facebook message. I fell to the ground and screamed, the most blood curdling scream. I then had to call my little sister and tell her. I grieved completely differently. I cried constantly for the first 3 days. I shared her photos over social media, I wanted people to know the pain I was in. And then I flew to be with her family (she has 3 children) and I didn't cry once whilst I was there. And now I still cry every time I get in the shower.  \n\nGrief is not something you can or should control, it is not something you should expect of someone. It is a deeply personal and life changing experience.  \n\nOP I am so so sorry you are going through this, it is utterly heartbreaking. Please surround yourself with people who will keep you safe and let you grieve organically."

pics,3c9seu,vgee,"To everyone who is asking why OP is posting on Reddit today and why he isn't talking to someone. \n\nHe just lost that person. \n\nYou all act like Reddit is a normal place where people who are inherently sociable come to talk. When really many of you are lonely or so introverted, without Reddit you would only have yourselves to talk to. Consider that. \n\nHe has come here to find solace and express his sadness. You all do that each and everyday in your own ways. \n\nGive this guy a break and let him grieve instead of insulting him for his choices. Maybe tomorrow he will decide this was a bad idea, but for now it may be all he has. \n\nOP - I am truly sorry for the loss of your other half. No one here can imagine the pain you are currently feeling. Be grateful for every second you shared together and never let those memories go. Let yourself grieve, it will hurt. It might hurt every single day to the end of your life, but at least you shared a portion of it with someone that really meant something to you. \n\nThank you for sharing something with us that is so personal to you. I hope you can find peace."

Every time I saw someone laughing I just wanted to shake them and say ""how dare you laugh when I hurt this much?"". Grief is crazy and everyone handles it differently. My sister died a few months ago and I grieved differently, I became frozen almost, and I shared photos on social media. She was beautiful and I wanted everyone to know how amazing she was. Maybe the fact she died suddenly and my Dad didnt made a difference, I don't know. But if sharing photos on Reddit helps this guy, in the most unbearably painful time of his life, then let it help him."

For some kind words?  For empathy?\n\nIf he’s lying, WHO CARES?  The world keeps spinning and this post will quickly flit out of memory.\nBut if he’s not, then sit with the fact that you went out of your way to put someone down on one of the worst days of their life.  \n\nStay strong, OP.

I don't expect to reach the front page or to be given gold. I just think Sebastian didn't get to see the world like he should have so the world should at least see him. \n\nThat's just how I see it.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss OP.

pics,3c9seu,MonkeyNacho,"I honestly have no idea why people are such assholes on this thread. Some people deal with it certain ways and sometimes the best advice/help you can get is from strangers, not the people you hold closest. Even if this ended up being fake, how would you know? Can you prove it? Nope, he may of actually loved her and shared this picture for support. Its literally internet points that mean nothing, so why not just pretend like its real until proven otherwise and grow a heart for once, instead of judging and calling OP a pile of shit."

pics,3c9seu,LiveLoveAloha,"I lost my wife of 29 years on October 19. 2007.  As others have pointed out I cannot offer any sage advice.  The first year I was completely lost and numb.  Could not sleep to speak of and if my co-workers had not been angels I'd probably have lost my job.  My whole world ended.  Then I began to have grief in earnest and I drank heavily anytime I was not at work.  That went on for 18 months.  I used to scoff at stories of how a man's wife would die and he became a homeless alcoholic.  I don't scoff anymore.  Gradually over the last 6 years I've climbed out of that deep, dark pit I was in and have rejoined the land of the living.  But the bloody, gaping hole in my heart is still there.  It scabbed over and eventually those scabs fell off replaced by scar tissue but nothing will ever be the same.  A bright light went out in my world and I have yet to meet anyone I am interested in spending time with.  I found ""the one"" and we shared a glorious, albeit much too short, life.  I wallow in the affection of my children and dote on my grandkids but in quiet moments I am still painfully lonely and I am never very far away from sobbing like a child.  I'm a fan of movie quotes and this one really nails it for me. \n\nDoctor Marcia Fieldstone: People who truly loved once are far more likely to love again. Sam, do you think there's someone out there you could love as much as your wife?\n\nSam Baldwin: Well, Dr. Marcia Fieldstone, that's hard to imagine.\n\nDoctor Marcia Fieldstone: What are you going to do?\n\nSam Baldwin: Well, I'm gonna get out of bed every morning... breathe in and out all day long. Then, after a while I won't have to remind myself to get out of bed every morning and breathe in and out... and, then after a while, I won't have to think about how I had it great and perfect for a while.\n\nDoctor Marcia Fieldstone: Tell me what was so special about your wife?\n\nSam Baldwin: Well, how long is your program? Well, it was a million tiny little things that, when you added them all up, they meant we were supposed to be together... and I knew it. I knew it the very first time I touched her. It was like coming home... only to no home I'd ever known... I was just taking her hand to help her out of a car and I knew. It was like... magic."

pics,3c9seu,noious,It's not often that you kind of hope that OP is full of shit for karma. Kinda hoping that's the case today.
pics,3c9seu,enigma2g,"To all you redditors who think op is karma whoring, let me explain what's going on in simple terms so you can understand: \n\nIf you look through op's history. He's a very casual user. Probably because he, unlike you, is well liked with a busy social life. \n\nHe probably gives no fucks about karma.\n\nHe's also a legit guy who offered another redditor 15 bucks to help with groceries. I know it's hard to understand with your narrow view, but this is what kind hearted people do. This is what maturity is. \n\nAlso, if you think he's a bad person because he's sharing his grief in a public forum. Let me help you understand. OP has something called a ""girlfriend,"" you've probably heard of it. It's a real woman companion! Cool stuff, huh? \n\nSo when you have this thing called a girlfriend, that you love, you are proud of; you'd most likely grieve if she passed. I imagine op was so proud of the woman he lost, that he wanted share a pic of her with you. \n\nSo if you're mad about some technicality op may have violated posting this pic, Here's the thing, the nuances of a proper post are most likely lost on people with real lives who do more than reddit. You can be mad but your rules don't mean shit. Sorry.\n\nOP had a picture, he shared it on r/pics. Analyzing any further than this is unnecessary but go ahead, do it, I've realized that where there are people, there will alway be ""dumb"". \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't have shared this, there is no barrier of entry to get on reddit and be a jerk. There's too many sour people here who did not make it in real life, who want to make others feel the shame they themselves feel on a daily basis. \n\nTl;dr - you are either on the lower rungs of IQ ladder or 15. Or both."

pics,3c9seu,skybluecooper,"Grieving is weird... My best friend asked me on Christmas day to move back home and marry him. He died January 3rd, just past 2 am. His family called me and I spent the entire night hysterical, and then went to work the next morning. I made it about 3 hours before I was collapsed, hyperventilating, completely losing it in the corner in front of 10+ coworkers, but I didn't go home from work. I needed that routine and I needed to not be alone, even if I hadn't ever felt more alone. I still find it's often easier to talk to strangers than family or close friends."
pics,3c9seu,jadedgoldfish,"How do you know until it happens? Everyone who has ever lost someone they love has faced criticism from others due to the way they have chosen to grieve. Everyone grieves differently. Some choose to talk to those close to them, and others find that difficult and find it easier to talk to strangers. Some mourn a life lost and others celebrate a life lived.\n\nHowever they grieve it needs to be however is best for the living. And those around should support that person, even if their grieving process is different to how we would do it. Providing the person isn't harming themself or others it's fine."

I'm more annoyed by people who feel the need to constantly call people ""karma whores"" than people who lie on the internet.\n\nOP, I'm sorry to hear about your loss. You're in my thoughts."

On the day that the love of their life died, the last thing any human being with a soul would do is think, ""I should post about this on that internet site.""\n\nAnd before you downvote the crap out of me, just know that I too have been through a family death, and these posts boil my blood. So it's not that ""I just don't understand""."
pics,3c9seu,angrymonkey,"About a year ago I found my father's body in the bathroom of his house, halfway curled up as if he had died in a sitting position and then fallen face-first into the wall.  The force of his head hitting the wall as he fell forward had stripped the paint off in a neat line about a foot long.  Blood had pooled in his face and lower body, which had both turned a dark purple by the time I arrived, and a thick mucous was hanging off of his nose and mouth.  Shortly after the police arrived, my father's identical twin brother called the house to see if my father was alright, and I had the great displeasure of informing him that he was dead.  I remember this as clearly today as I did on the night that it happened, and not a day goes by that I don't see that image in my head, or hear my uncle's voice on the phone as he slowly began to break down.\n\nDo you ant to know what I spent my entire night doing after I finally managed to come home, after having spent hours lingering in my father's house trying to stop myself from crying?  I browsed Reddit and replied to random posts until I was so tired I wanted to throw up.  I wasn't able to sleep for more than an hour at a time for days, and the only way I was able to keep myself from thinking about what I had been through was to keep clicking and writing and hoping that I would finally calm down enough to be able to get a decent night's sleep.  Knowing that I had a link to the outside world that didn't require me to leave my house made a huge difference in how I felt.  On Reddit, no one needed to know anything was wrong with me, and I could pretend that everything was fine as long as my mind was always occupied with something that seemed normal.  If I had been in possession of a digital picture of my father during this time, I would have been tempted to post it here.  ""Here is a picture of a living, breathing man,"" I would say, and I would momentarily bring him back to life in front of everyone;  in their minds he would be exactly as he was in the image, and not the rotting corpse he was in mine.  It would have helped me tremendously to have known that everyone was thinking about him as he was in life, because that's how I wanted to be able to think of him in that moment, but I couldn't seem to find a way to do so."

pics,3c9seu,Thedicewoman,"I had my dad move in with me when he was terminally ill. I was prepared for his death for a year. We both had a sick sense of humor, we would joke about what to do with his body, how to tell people, the fun funerals, the mean things i could say on his behalf after he passed. This is how we coped together. \n\nWhen he passed away, I had no one to joke with. I tried to get others to join, but all I did was alienate people because it was too awkward for them. THE JOKES WERE GOOD GOD DAMNIT! But still, I found myself joking with people who didnt know my father passed away to help me cope. Then 4 months later, there was no new material, no new jokes, so I cried and mourned. I say this because I tried to make a joke about his death the day after i held his hand.\n\nI thought I had a point about how people view death very differently in the first weeks similar to how shock handles pain, but instead I ranted about my own problems.

pics,3c9seu,teahle,You really don't understand. It's entirely possible for two human beings to experience similar things and react to them radically differently. Just because you would react differently if the love of your life dies doesn't mean that everyone in the entire world would or should react in the same way.\n\nEmpathy is understanding that people are different from you and still expressing compassion towards them. I implore you to express it.
pics,3c9seu,Direpants,I might have done it when my brother died. \n\nHe was a very good person that helped a lot of people and I would have wanted people to know that.\n\nAlso the kind words and advice from people not trying to act like they knew him best would have been appreciated.

pics,3c9seu,YoungCinny,"Don't kick somebody when they're at a very low point in their life, angrymonkey.\n\nMaybe the OP doesn't have much support at the moment (maybe his family and friends live far away) and he's reaching out for help online. You don't know him personally, so you labelling him as ""incredibly f***ed up"" is cruel and unnecessary.\n\nDudeDC is grieving and is most likely in shock...give the guy a break."
pics,3c9seu,Sail-to-the-Moon,"What's fucked up is that you're arguing about the validity of this post. Just accept the fact that OP lost a loved one, pay your respects, and move on. Don't be an ass, dude."
pics,3c9seu,ComedicFailure,"Really? Really??\n\nThe last time I lost someone close to me do you know what I did? I locked myself in my room for 2 whole days. During that time I wept and wept and desperately sought some kind of relief, consolation, what have you. Shame on you for trying to shame someone trying to cope with the worst thing to ever happen to them."
pics,3c9seu,grumbledum,"I'd rather he post on Reddit because we're the only people he can come to, than that he'd do stupid shit."
pics,3c9seu,lydocia,Maybe he was hoping for posts with similar stories for him to read to help him deal with it. Or he wanted something to do to keep his mind busy.
pics,3c9seu,toxins,"Be it fake or not, accusations in this situation only have the ability to inflict more pain."
pics,3c9seu,MsArcaida,"So it's not that ""I just don't understand"".\n\n\nWrong, it's exactly that.\n\nDifferent people have different ways of coping.  Being a fuckwit is apparently your way.  Godspeed, fuckwit."
pics,3c9seu,HipsterHunter,"I think most people have been through a family death to ""understand."" Don't exclude yourself for being special in any way. Death occurs each and every day."
pics,3c9seu,putrid_poo_nugget,"After my grandma died I played Minecraft all day. It's not that I didn't care, just that I needed to not think about it. \n\nMaybe OP knew they would get support if they posted it? I'd say that's a valid reason."
pics,3c9seu,GammaGames,"Sometimes it's too hard to be around close friends and family in moments of grief. Everyone grieves differently. Strangers on the internet are supportive voices that you don't have to cry in front of for hours on end and then feel guilty for sobbing on their couch until you fall asleep out of exhaustion, and then they feel awkward and put a blanket on you because you're there now and then you wake up and feel like shit because now your life sucks and also you're inconveniencing everyone around you with your pain. \n\nWe live in an age where you can be alone in your grief without actually feeling isolated. Give this guy a break; not everyone is in it for the karma. Some of us are crippled introverts who need the community."
pics,3c9seu,julesburne,"Why not? Why shouldn't he chose to share his feelings and honor his loved one in the way he wishes? If Reddit is where he wants to share his feelings, he should get to. Don't like it? Down vote it but in no way is he wrong for wanting to share some bad news that's happened. He's not alone and probably feels it right now, damn right we should be there for him."
pics,3c9seu,Koean,"I don't know, memorializing someone permanently on the internet and giving a historical timestamp of their life seems like a normal way of coping.  I've never felt compelled to do that but I could understand someone who was."
pics,3c9seu,rydan,"everyone copes with loss differently, what OP needs is support (which I'm pretty sure he is looking for here) not people like you judging what he should've done and not done. maybe he feels that it is best to share with people who he isn't close with, who are you to judge?"
pics,3c9seu,leopoldhendricks,Not sure it's up to you to decide what this guy does is it

pics,3c9seu,mumooshka,"For everyone defending OP, what about her family?  They just lost a sister/daughter and now someone is whoring her out for karma???\n\nOP doesn't say anywhere that they are married.  From the context all we know is that he loved her.  Maybe they dated for a month.  Maybe they're coworkers and she didn't feel the same way about him.\n\nIf this was my sibling I'd be furious with OP.\n\n(And shit, what if she has acquaintances who don't even know she's passed yet?  They're going to find out on reddit???)"
pics,3c9seu,Joliet_Jake_Blues,"I hate hate hate posts like this for this reason. That and the absolutely creepy comments people leave making up assumptions saying they feel 'honored' to see this blurry picture, how they can tell they loved each other, how they are totally crying, a bunch of nonsense.

I know you feel terrible and I know every single of the comments in this thread have the same intention I have: to help you to cope with this insanely hurtful loss of yours. But no one really can. This is why I would like to ask something from you: everyone who reads the post of yours, sees how happy you and your gorgeous woman have been and is instantly devastated and overcome by sadness. But the way your love smiled in this photo, it does not seem like she wants everyone to be sad and would prefer her life to be celebrated...This is why I would love to ask you, if you were so kind,  come back, whenever you feel ready in the future, and tell us more about her, enable us -together as a community- to celebrate her life, that she was on this earth and every person who reads your post of today and the one in the future will remember her, even if it is only a tiny bit, and then she will still be there...in all of us..and not be that ""random internet face""..She will be more than that...and I think you and her deserve that...I am deeply sorry for your loss and I hope every single comment here helps you to cope with the unimaginable pain..."

pics,3c7ymg,TehBoomBoom,Is Truckee a nice place to live? I'm looking to move somewhere closer to the Sierra.
pics,3c7ymg,ADDEDIT-R,"I live in Reno 30 min from Truckee, it's a nice place mostly a winter ski bum/ silicone valley vacation cabin/ganja farmer town. Lots of snow and on the small side."
pics,3c7ymg,Saltydoodler,"It is the best place I've ever lived, however, I spent $400/month on utilities alone."
pics,3c7ymg,odansteron,For heating? Most of the houses I've looked at around Tahoe have big wood stoves in the middle of the living room so I imagine most people buy a cord of wood to keep warm throughout the winter to save on gas and electric heating. \n\nI'm guessing the Nevada high desert neighborhoods east of Tahoe would be more frugal and livable than my dream of living in a cabin in the woods.
pics,3c7ymg,ADDEDIT-R,"I lived in an old cabin with cheap rent and I learned why rent was cheap the hard way. This thing was terribly insulated. Old windows etc. The entire thing was heated by 1 stove that operated on natural gas. We spent about $300 a month on the gas bill to heat the place.  We didn't even run it at night- when I woke up in the morning I could see my breath. \n\nWood stove is a good way to go. Living in Truckee was absolutely amazing though. I'm going to move back within the next 3 years. The downside of living there is high cost of living and not a lot of opportunities for employment. But in my opinion, the benefits far outweigh the negatives."

pics,3c78mp,tenfingersandtoes,"You're a lucky, lucky man, as I'm sure you know. (Unless maybe you're in Canada or rural Maine; then this would be slightly easier to come by.\n\nTo those from the northeast and unawares, wild Brook Trout are rare. They were once abundant, though. Daniel Webster, he of political fame, I believe at one point held the Massachusetts state record, and they have a prominent place (among fish anyway) in early American literature. \n\nBut they require clean, cold water. There's very little of that left now. It's not just a matter of pollution and global warming. Little things, like reduced tree cover at stream banks and increased unnatural runoff and sediment as a result of development and industrialization, makes brook trout unable to survive in many rivers where they once thrived. Brown trout and rainbow trout are a bit hardier, so they're stocked in local rivers for sport. But neither fish are native to the region like the brook trout. (Technically it's not a trout; it's a char.)\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that this photo is much more than a pretty fish. It's evidence of a healthy, natural ecosystem, and it's an an argument for better environmental stewardship. It's proof that we can have nice things."

pics,3c8zlw,an_adult_on_reddit,"I feel like he can rock something like George Clooney. A very clean and ""conservative"" beard that does a good job of showing your age (I assume older men like to make themselves look their age) but also outlining your jawline. I think that it's really easy to get swept up by the alpha mentality of ""grow your beard as much as you can and never cut it"", but in my personal opinion I think that full on beards don't really make people look attractive. I think it's nice to make them look grizzlier and more reliable maybe, but in terms of aesthetics I tend not to think that a full beard like this is the way to go."
pics,3c8zlw,hayashirice911,"I agree, this is the way to go."
pics,3c8zlw,LiveLoveAloha,I think that it's really easy to get swept up by the alpha mentality \n\n\nI think it's really easy for girls to get swept up in that alpha mentality of growing their hair long. So many girls try to be alpha by growing their hair long.\n\n^ See what's wrong with that statement?
pics,3c8zlw,TohkYuBong,"I honestly have no idea what is wrong with the statement.\n\nI am saying that I personally think that we take things we find ""alpha"" simply too far to be attractive for most women.\n\nThings like height, facial hair, muscle mass, and voice pitch are things I would argue society considers ""alpha"". I however completely disagree with the notion that the most alpha =  the most aesthetic/attractive. By that logic the most percieved attractive males would be 6'4, bear mode, crazy ass beard, with a deep ass voice. The reality is not really so. I would argue that what we perceive as attractive is more of a delicate balance between of ""alpha"" traits. So facial hair, but nothing too crazy like a full on beard. Muscle mass, but nothing so crazy like bodybuilders. Tall, but not so ridiculously tall like 6'3 +.So I am obviously basing my argument on the idea of aesthetic, which I have stated.\n\nAnd I don't think that I even have to state this, but there are obviously women out there who prefer men with insane ""alpha"" traits such as these and I am not arguing that they are wrong. OP's wife is obviously one of those women who would not like a fully bearded man and I don't blame her for it."

pics,3c8zlw,randomasfuuck27,What about having a beard is recent or a fad?
pics,3c8zlw,ImaMechE,People have been having beards forever obviously.  But it has become more and more prevalent with people in their 20's the last few years.  It kind of is a fad.
pics,3c8zlw,jiggy68,I think you're wrong about this.\n\nAlso this guy is not in his 20s.
pics,3c8zlw,ImaMechE,"It's pretty common knowledge it is a fad.  Google search ""beard fad"".  there are hundreds of articles. Whether it lasts no one can say, but the rise in the bearded population in the US the past few years has been noted."
pics,3c8zlw,jiggy68,"Searched Google. Still not convinced. No stats given just people whining about a nonexistent fad. I get hipsters have adopted the beard but there is no way this is even 10 percent of the bearded population. This guy isn't even in this category anyway. Not a fad, been popular for thousands of years."
pics,3c8zlw,ImaMechE,Nevermind.  If you don't see a huge growth in the number of bearded men the last 5 years there's no point in talking to you about it's recent popularity.

pics,3c8zlw,Carefreejohn200,Beards are unhygienic.  Dirty. \nI served in the Army for 6 years and was required to shave every day I wore my uniform. \nShaving every day was important to curtail sickness and disease. \nBeards carry germs and... if that doesn't bother you consider this: \nBeards also carry fecal matter...\n.....you may or may not want to tell your wife.

pics,3c8zlw,matthewfelgate,Certainly not my experience. Beard was on and off for years depending on how irked I was by the price of razor blades. Let it grow with the occasional pro trim and I get a lot of positive feedback from women (even when my wife is standing next to me).

pics,3c7pix,Fairazz,Is that a battery powered nail gun? How did that work out for you?
pics,3c7pix,Sorros,"Worked out great actually. The fact that the mailbox was like over 100 feet away from the air compressor, I had zero cords to strecth out and noise was never a factor. And I only recharged the battery at night when I was done using it."
pics,3c7pix,Fairazz,"I came here to comment on the gun too myself.   I use air powered guns all day long at work.  How many shots do you think you got on a charge?  Did it have any trouble setting the nails all the way down?  Would you recommend for a professional, I mean, does it feel like a toy or like it can be beat up everyday?"
pics,3c7pix,Sorros,They are used by lots of professionals but the type of work you do and the size of the job would depend on whether or not you would use a one.  \n\nI do Residential wood fencing and there is no way a battery powered one could keep up with you are using 3-4000 nails a day.\n\nThey are meant for small framing jobs and detail work such as crown molding.
pics,3c7pix,ImProbablyNotWanking,"I would really use for crown mostly.  Working with tall crown, high ceilings, and standing on a baker scaffold gets tough using an air line.   But I hate buying tools, expensive tools if I don't know or talked to anyone who's used them first."
pics,3c7pix,So_Appalled,Some use a battery and fuel cell and others are battery only.\n\nIf you are thinking of purchasing one i would look into how many shots you can get per fuel cell and how many can be shot with a single charge on the guns that use both.\n\nThen there was one from SENCO that use only a battery.  Senco makes some of the better Pneumatic guns.  The only problem i could see is needing more than one battery which can be 100$ or more.\n\nAlso if you already have a Pneumatic and a compressor look into different Hoses not all hoses are created equal.  The more expensive hoses are usually lighter and more flexible and some can even be a smaller diameter. The more expensive hoses will run you about 50 cents more a foot somewhere around 1-1.25 a foot.  Last year we got new hoses 2 50 foot lengths for i think 125$ with fittings.
pics,3c7pix,JCARPX,"It says that it will shoot 1,000 nails per charge. Every nail shot straight through and none of them stuck up even the slightest bit (I was using 2"" nails). It's not a toy and seems every bit as durable as my Bosch Air Nailer."

You wait here, okay?” The second hobo nods and waits out of sight, salivating at the thought of eating some pie.\n\nThe first hobo knocks on the door, which is soon answered by an ugly old woman. “Ma’am, I spotted those pies on the window sill and was wondering if I could get one of them from you? I’ll work for it, if need be.” The old woman responded with “Follow me into the kitchen.”\n\nOnce they were both in the kitchen, the old woman said “I haven’t had a man in many years, since my husband passed away. I’ll give you both of those pies if you’ll have sex with me right here, right now.” The hobo thought about it while looking around. He spotted some ears of corn on the counter near the window and had an idea.\n\n“Well, if you’ll just turn around and bend over across the kitchen table, I’ll take care of you,” said the hobo. The old woman, excited as she was, complied instantly by pulling off her clothes and doing exactly as the hobo said.\n\nThe hobo reached behind his back, grabbed an ear of corn, shoved it in and serviced the old woman with it for at least 5 minutes. When he saw that the kernels were all soft and wet, he tossed it out the window. The old woman screamed “More, more!”\n\nThe hobo grabbed another ear and another for the next 30 minutes. When the old woman indicated she was satisfied, she turned around and said “Okay, I promised the pies to you. Go ahead and take them. Thank you for the pleasure of your company.”\n\nThe hobo grabbed the pies and headed out the door and found his friend near the window sill. “Hey,” he said, “here are the pies. Let’s go eat.” The other hobo looked at him and said “No thanks, I’m full. I just ate a whole bunch of hot buttered corn.”"

pics,3c8w1n,idontdothefbthing,"Yeah, it's their yard."
pics,3c8w1n,Steavee,No. You cannot mantrap your own property. This is near certainly a civil liability and almost as certainly criminal in their state as well.
pics,3c8w1n,callmejenkins,"Acually, it's not. A few feet from the road is state property to put in utility lines and what not."
pics,3c8w1n,Steavee,"That's an easement, and in this case it has no bearing on the legality of his boards. They're almost certainly illegal either way. You can't booby trap things, even your own property."

pics,3c8w1n,haharrison,"We just moved in. I have no doubt that the previous tenants were driving in their lawn, though. That section of their yard is next to the main road, so it could be other drivers as well. I'm just concerned about a kid falling off his bike on it or something."
pics,3c8w1n,ms_quince,That's a very legit concern to have. You should talk to your neighbor instead of posting it about it on here. \n\nYou shouldn't match passive-aggressiveness with more passive-aggressiveness. Confront your neighbors in a very polite way and try to come to a compromise. \n\nThe boulders are a much safer way to protect the damn lawn. Doesn't matter if it's legal or illegal. \n\nI'm sure your neighbor is only being a dick because the previous owners gave them a reason to be a dick. There must have been some terrible communication issues between neighbors for someone to ever come to the conclusion that putting down a strip of nails is the only solution remaining.
pics,3c8w1n,Votearrows,"That's good advise. Unfortunately, that's exactly what I just did before posting. My only request was that he put some flags up to warn drivers of the hazard. He said they would look tacky, and I should just ""Stop driving on his property.""  Again, I just moved in two weeks ago. What's most concerning is he said that cops told him to put the boards there after several complaints. Altogether, it wasn't a very productive conversation.\n\nSo is this legal? Would cops really approve a hazard like this? I'm sure it depends on the area (I'm in Hattiesburg, MS btw), but I wanted to hear what other people thought."

pics,3c8w1n,billnyeisjustok,/r/legaladvice should be able to tell you.
pics,3c8w1n,labrys71,Take a lot of pictures of that. When you get out of you car one day step on that you can sue him for his house. By the way the police may have something to say about that. I would say that qualifies as a booby trap.
pics,3c8w1n,Sutex,"I stepped on one of these when I was 9 while exploring the woods and bled like crazy, they could get sued if a child was seriously hurt, thankfully I just bled and wasn't seriously injured."
pics,3c8w1n,callmejenkins,Your best bet is to actually call the police and let them know your concerns. The least he could do is put up a warning letting people know the danger...this could harm animals as well as children.

pics,3c9yjc,Ezra141,"This is close to where I live! Also, your title is kind of interesting to me because I've never actually heard it being referred to as Louise Lake before, we always just call it Lake Louise."

pics,3c9ugh,PostComa,"Curly Joe (Joe DeRita) appeared in several full length features after the initial 190 Columbia shorts (1934-1959) starring Moe, Larry, Curly, Shemp, and Joe Besser had ended. After Larry Fine died in 1975, Moe asked longtime costar and Stooge foil Emil Sitka to play Larry's brother ""Harry"". The act was to appear in an R rated film called Blazing Stewardesses. Sitka agreed, but only these promotional photos were taken before Moe died of lung cancer that year."
pics,3c9sqa,DanDalVlan,There were no girls there?
pics,3c9sqa,AtavistHermit,There are no actual women in this photo.
pics,3c9sqa,AtavistHermit,But it was a women's match. A bunch of men gathered together and played Dress-Up with silly costumes for a women's sporting event?
pics,3c9sqa,AtavistHermit,Yes?
pics,3c9sqa,seadoor,I guess this is what our grandfathers died for at Normandy. lol.

pics,3c9rzm,Big_blacks_ducks_4,yes.
pics,3c9rzm,grogipher,"Queen Victoria had many titles, none of which included ""Queen of England"". Most appropriate would be ""Queen of the United Kingdom"". \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria#Titles.2C_styles.2C_and_arms"
pics,3c9rzm,grogipher,I feel like you missed the obvious sarcasm in my post....

pics,3c8izo,Yellowfin1990,"Often regarded as the most beautiful arch in the world, Delicate Arch stands 65 feet (20m) above the steep sandstone formations below.  Delicate Arch is the most recognizable feature of Arches National Park and is an icon of the state of Utah. The Delicate Arch was formed from Entrada Sandstone which was gradually worn away by weathering and wind erosion over millions of years. Delicate Arch is accessible through a moderate 1.5 mile (2.4km) hike up steep slickrock and around narrow rock ledges. On the horizon lies the snow-capped La Sal Mountains which contrasts the deep colors of the surrounding Entrada Sandstone. \n\n“A weird lovely fantastic object out of nature, like Delicate Arch, has the curious ability to remind us — like rock and sunlight and wind and wilderness — that out there is a different world, older and greater and deeper by far than ours” – Edward Abbey"
