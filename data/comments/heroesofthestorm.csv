heroesofthestorm,3e2ps8,Apotheosis276,15,Tue Jul 21 18:49:57 2015 UTC,Raynor has increased XP range because he's a man....the kinda man who built the Eiffel Tower out of steel and brawn.  Nova's just a woman ghost with an XP soak range 1/3 the size of his.

heroesofthestorm,3e2ps8,twatpire,7,Tue Jul 21 16:46:49 2015 UTC,I agree with this. Would really like to be able to check XP. The most common problem I see in myself is when vision overlaps with minion vision/tower vision. If I'm in a losing lane and constantly having to be behind towers or play defensively I would like to be able to tell if I'm actually soaking.

heroesofthestorm,3e2ps8,troglodyte,3,Tue Jul 21 15:17:33 2015 UTC,"This has always seemed weird to me. Why not just have them soak for a percentage of the standard amount instead of rolling the dice and sometimes having them get full exp?  In a game with no last-hitting they put in a last hitting mechanic on an NPC you can't control, very strange."
heroesofthestorm,3e2ps8,Zultar327,6,Tue Jul 21 18:23:15 2015 UTC,"This last hit mechanic actually exists on all heroes, if you get the last hit you get xp regardless of range (relevant on heroes like Azmodan). The locust in this case is just an extension of Abathur."
heroesofthestorm,3e2ps8,olosniffer,9,Tue Jul 21 18:44:46 2015 UTC,That's correct. Locusts have to last hit a minion to gain exp credit.
heroesofthestorm,3e2ps8,EuRenideo,9,Tue Jul 21 15:17:32 2015 UTC,"Also in general all emanations of heroes soak xp. Damage from any source which originates from the hero, be it from summons, a DoT, whatever."

heroesofthestorm,3e2ps8,Aaa111999,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:18:46 2015 UTC,Does the XP gain for the team get affected at all by how many heroes are in range of it? I've been trying to figure out how some teams can get massive XP advantages without kills or objectives and it's frustrating.
heroesofthestorm,3e2ps8,plapsauce,0,Tue Jul 21 16:29:29 2015 UTC,"XP can only be gained once per team. If two heroes are in range of a dying minion, they both soak that XP but it only adds to the team's level once.  Teams can get XP leads by bullying people out of soak range while also soaking all lanes on the map. Any lane that one team is soaking that the other team isn't is a really big deal in the early game."
heroesofthestorm,3e2ps8,Aaa111999,3,Tue Jul 21 16:35:48 2015 UTC,"To expand on this, in the early game, a hero kill is worth less XP than a minion wave. So if you leave a lane empty in order to assist a gank, you could actually be hurting your team even if the gank is successful."
heroesofthestorm,3e2ps8,myndzero,3,Tue Jul 21 18:08:59 2015 UTC,"From what I've found. When a minion dies let's say it gives you 100 xp (just so it's easy to work with). If there is 2 heroes in range, both will get credit. Meaning the stat screen will show player 1 got 100 xp and player 2 got 100 xp. So it would look like 200 was earned. However, only 100 xp gets added to the team pool.   Now how teams get big level advantages. In the early game, all the way until level 10 I believe, a full wave of 7 minions is actually worth more xp than a kill. So so despite your team getting 3 kills, if you missed out on 4-5 waves getting those kills, and your opponents did not, they are ahead in levels now. That's why pro teams will rotate a hero into a lane to soak while others drop back for mana/health. Early game minions are crucial to getting all of them to get to 10 first/at the same point as your opponents for objective team fights."

While the last sentence is correct, the xp is split between all players nearby, or the entire team if no one is nearby in the event of a tower/fort. This was changed in a closed beta patch back in may."
heroesofthestorm,3e2ps8,SurpriseBukkake,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:17 2015 UTC,That's my bad. I must have missed when they changed that. Thanks for correcting me.
heroesofthestorm,3e2ps8,Natalon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:13 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure this was recently changed. The stats screen now only displays xp that was obtained individually. xp that was received by more than 1 hero is not added to the tally.
heroesofthestorm,3e2ps8,sumelar,14,Tue Jul 21 17:16:59 2015 UTC,No the number of heroes in range has no effect. Large xp leads are due to better laning (don't miss out on those waves) and more importantly towers grant large experience boost early on.
heroesofthestorm,3e2ps8,__tacocat__,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:11 2015 UTC,I think it just gets split between how many are in range.

heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,j20hundred,9,Tue Jul 21 17:47:40 2015 UTC,"Adding another to the ""What happened with TL"" train. Team League isn't going to be a thing until they stop the ability to queue as 5 in Hero League."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,zerafool,10,Tue Jul 21 17:49:53 2015 UTC,Introducing bans to Team League will definitely incentivize 5 man teams to play Team League over Hero League.
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,GTmauf,3,Tue Jul 21 17:52:46 2015 UTC,"Depending on the way bans are implemented, this would up the number of heroes you need to own for TL to at least 12."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,AldorPeacekeeper,2,Tue Jul 21 13:24:36 2015 UTC,"There's no depending. It will increase the number of required heroes but that isn't a bad thing. If it takes too much time to get the required number of heroes, Blizzard should lower costs for the heroes rather than slacking on making the game better, which bans do."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,LegendReborn,0,Tue Jul 21 13:51:51 2015 UTC,"Not necessary. Ever since Blizzard made the 10 hero requirement they've been adding more and more ways to get gold faster. We have treasure goblins (temporarily), level 9 and 15 rewards, free stim packs, and a couple of price drops on heroes."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,Lucavious,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:03 2015 UTC,"What I mean is that the number of owned heroes you will need is going to depend on how many heroes can be banned. If it's one per team, you need 12, if it's 2, you need 14, and so on."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,AldorPeacekeeper,0,Tue Jul 21 14:02:36 2015 UTC,"It is 2 per team, if you've watched the recent tournament.  14 heroes minimum for team league would probably be fine.

heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,koorashi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:43 2015 UTC,"I'd rather they just add bans to Hero League too.  Increasing the barrier to entry on Hero League probably isn't a bad thing, and I say that as someone who hasn't yet unlocked Hero League."

heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,ShadowLiberal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:53:38 2015 UTC,"It's only ""dead"" because you can 5 man queue hero league. Once they implement the party cap on queueing for hero league all of the 5 stacks will move to team league.  And I put dead in quotes because it has already gotten a lot better. Our queue times in TL are pretty much the same as when we 5 stack HL at this point."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,merkwerk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:49 2015 UTC,I'm curious as to how the ban system will play out as HotS adds more and more heroes. Or maybe just if balancing makes more heroes competitive. Right it seems now only about 12-15 or so heroes are standard with a handful that pop in rarely. If all 38 were playable the ban system as is wouldn't be as interesting.
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,N8CCRG,0,Tue Jul 21 15:18:14 2015 UTC,"In Dota 2 at least (Which have 110 heroes, with 2 yet to be ported from WC3 Dota), you have 5 picks and 5 bans each team. They by default disallow you to pick the same hero (Except for the All Mid gamemode).  In Hots the team comp can be more relaxed since a lot of heroes in the same category (Warrior, Assassin, etc..) generally do the same thing.  Not in Dota, teams pick a hero for their 1 ability, yes only because they have that spell. Batrider is a good example, he have a ultimate which is called ""Flaming Lasso"", what is does is that it stuns an enemy for 3-4 seconds, and allow you to walk around with the stunned target (A very old video example). Combine this with the Item ""Blink Dagger"", ""Firefly"" (Batrider ability, give him flying movement and vision), ""Force Staff"", and movement speed items, and you can just instantly take a hero out of the fight for your team to focus down."

heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,GTmauf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:56 2015 UTC,If bans ever come to HL I can see banning Nova being very popular to keep allies from picking her.  But in TL with organized teams nobody's going to ban her.

heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,jeremynsl,2,Tue Jul 21 17:49:10 2015 UTC,It is a mediocre way of trying to keep the skill level high. The better way to implement it would be to only allow people to play heroes that meet a certain level requirement (and have 10 heroes that meet that requirement).
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,JanusJames,6,Tue Jul 21 18:27:09 2015 UTC,"Yup, I'm agreed with that.  What level do you think would be good?"
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,jeremynsl,5,Tue Jul 21 18:41:51 2015 UTC,"It's because the heroes on the free week, well, change every week. So on some weeks you'll have over 10 heroes if you factor in the free week heroes, and in others you might not. It would be pretty weird if someone could do ranked one week, but not the next."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,Delmin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:27 2015 UTC,"Actually significantly more to be competitive, because it's much more likely that a full class gets banned and picked before you get the chance. Both teams ban a support, enemy picks up another, you now need 4+ supports to even get to choose one.  Right now, that only happens if a team takes a silly comp, like 5 supports."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,boooob4,16,Tue Jul 21 14:17:30 2015 UTC,Well this is team league. I'm guessing you probably have a person on your team that focuses on supports and thus probably has that? Also buying all the supports with gold is the cheapest bracket in the game.
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,CyaSteve,5,Tue Jul 21 14:35:12 2015 UTC,"Well, yes. This happens all the time in competitive play-- of course people will see it and try it as well. However, all you really need is Brightwing or Li Li when that happens-- Li Li isn't incredibly expensive, and she's usually the one that the other team tries to chokehold you into.  If you're playing Team League, shouldn't you have a support player on your team anyhow?"
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,Indarus1,5,Tue Jul 21 16:05:50 2015 UTC,Why would you ban a support if you don't have first pick in that situation?

heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,AbsolutBalderdash,0,Tue Jul 21 16:56:11 2015 UTC,"Jaina can clear waves much more quickly than kael thas, her damage is easier to hit, and she gets a defensive talent at 13, kael gets his defensive talent at 16 but it is never taken because ignite is way more powerful.  Also jaina offers better sieve and water elemental is arguably better than Phoenix"
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,BlazingRain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:18 2015 UTC,"Jaina's actual burst is way higher. She can do much more damage out quickly if she can get a full combo.  Kael'thas can't actually kill many heroes by unloading all his spells, and doesn't combo his spells in general, as he loses damage and increases his chances of getting killed by doing so. His primary damage source is on a 7 second cooldown, can't kill anyone on its own, and in between he wont be doing anything for the most part. Not only that, but even that damage itself is less than half immediate burst. The majority of it is a DoT followed by an second burst after a few seconds. Instead, he does heavy poke damage which puts tremendous pressure on the other team, forcing them to either commit to a quick fight, or a retreat. This ends up really effective against lower skilled teams, who are obsessed with team fighting at all times and are rarely willing to retreat before it's too late, but also don't know when to engage properly. So he basically gets free damage on the other team, and by the time they realize they need to bail, it's too late and the rest of Kael'thas' team has cleaned up."

heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,Kind_Of_Kind,-3,Tue Jul 21 16:25:41 2015 UTC,Same thing happened in LoL when every online competition was using chat to draft in custom games because they wanted 3 bans and it took ages to actually get 3 bans in the client. It was hilarious.
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,tehtiny,4,Tue Jul 21 18:14:32 2015 UTC,"I seriously do not understand why all these people here who never played another Moba in their life can not accept the idea of bans in HL.  it works in League of Legends ( one random captain from each team, 3 bans each )  and it works well.  how about taking notes from the bigger mobas instead of just saying no to everything."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,TXKSSnapper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:39:30 2015 UTC,"I would assume that Blizzard will implement it in Team League before considering it in Hero League, but it might also be part of their anti toxicity plans.  People will get angry because the random captain didn't ban the hero that they wanted to ban.  Hopefully it will be an option one day, but for now I think we'll survive."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,_wutdafuc,2,Tue Jul 21 14:59:34 2015 UTC,People will get angry because the random captain didn't ban the hero that they wanted to ban.   Make it a vote then.
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,TXKSSnapper,11,Tue Jul 21 15:30:43 2015 UTC,"Assuming that their reasoning is because of that, people will also get angry if the team doesn't vote their way.  Plus voting adds extra time to the draft, and how are votes done for those who afk during the draft?"
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,_wutdafuc,17,Tue Jul 21 15:46:59 2015 UTC,"AFK? time will run out and you didn't vote. If nobody votes, choose random hero.  And this poses no more of an issue with teammates getting upset at you for banning the wrong hero, than already exists when teammates get upset at you for picking the wrong hero.  I don't understand the issue; this isn't a hard thing to implement. It is fair as fair can be with regards to a single-queue scenario, and wouldn't take more than the normal amount of time a ban takes in other MOBAs."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,TXKSSnapper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"In regards to the AFK, this leads to the possibility of ties in voting.  Actually now that I think about it, there could be ties even if everyone votes.  How is this decided on? Does it become random between the tie?  With the lack of communication in most drafts this could become a problem.  It's true that it poses no more threat than a hero pick, but it's another thing added on to the list of things that people will flame and troll with.  It may be as fair as is possible in a single-queue scenario, but I don't think that's the question Blizzard is asking themselves.  They aren't currently looking at what would be most fair for a single-queue scenario, but rather what the best option (whether this is with or without bans) for the scenario.  Personally, I think bans in Hero League would be nice, but looking from Blizzard's viewpoint I can see a list of things that they would want to figure out first."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,_wutdafuc,5,Tue Jul 21 16:16:59 2015 UTC,"Does it become random between the tie?   Yes. I'm imagining a system almost exactly like that used to determine the next map in a CS:GO server. Everyone can vote, everyone sees everyone else's votes, you cannot change your vote, if there is a tie (include a tie of 0-votes because nobody voted) you get a random selection of the tied heroes."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,GTmauf,4,Tue Jul 21 16:25:31 2015 UTC,Next map in CS:GO and hero bans are apples and oranges.....

heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,_wutdafuc,2,Tue Jul 21 17:59:51 2015 UTC,That would be your fault for not voting. I don't see the issue here.
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,GTmauf,2,Tue Jul 21 18:06:35 2015 UTC,"That would take way too much time during the pick/ban phase. Plus if all 5 people vote a different hero, then what? This isn't realistic."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,_wutdafuc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:18 2015 UTC,How would it take any more time than a ban normally would take? If there's a tie randomly select from the tied heroes.
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,GTmauf,3,Tue Jul 21 18:07:18 2015 UTC,What if there are no tied heroes?
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,_wutdafuc,4,Tue Jul 21 18:16:13 2015 UTC,"Uh, then the one which won the vote is the banned hero? If nobody votes at all, then all the heroes are tied with 0 votes, so you'd get a random ban."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,GTmauf,3,Tue Jul 21 18:17:48 2015 UTC,"Random bans are absolutely ludicrous. Also what if there were 5 separate votes all for a different hero? You can't say ""random ban"" because again that's just not feasible."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,_wutdafuc,-2,Tue Jul 21 18:19:29 2015 UTC,"You get a random of the 5 selected. This isn't a hard concept, people vote, winner wins, if tie: random select from tied.  If you get a shitty ban or a random ban, that is your fault as a team for voting like fucktards."

heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,doyleredlandxx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:07 2015 UTC,I think bans could be needed MORE in HOTS because of the objective based gameplay.
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,joebenet,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:39 2015 UTC,MOBA newbie. So the captain bans three characters each per game? Does he just ban OP ones like Kael or Jaina? Is it mostly to get diversity in the heroes played in TL?
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,personalcheesecake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:10:29 2015 UTC,It's for strategy in your gameplay to avoid combos like that yes.
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,SoFFacet,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:24 2015 UTC,"Its up to each individual captain, but generally yes OP heroes will get banned. Heroes that the captain personally finds obnoxious or dislikes playing with or against may also get banned.   Sometimes red (2nd & 3rd picks) will intentionally try to leave open exactly 3 OP heroes so that they get 2 of those 3. Blue can try to avoid that by leaving either more or less than 3.   Some mobas like Smite and competitive HotS have a staggered ban phase where each side bans, then picks about half their team, then you ban some more, and then you complete the draft. This allows you to target your secondary bans at the roles that your opponents are still missing."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,tehtiny,5,Tue Jul 21 15:55:48 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.  majority of the time in League, the first ban will be for the most OP champion in the current meta ( Nidalee or Ryze )  the rest of the bans will be for champions you hate to play against or are counters to your strategy ( banning a disengage champion so you can play an initiator ).  as for your question on picks diversity, league and hots are different games, in League, every champion is Viable in Solo Q, so you see different champions a lot of the times.  the same can not be said about hots sadly because Jaina, KT, Zera, Johanna, Malf, Slyv and Muradin are almost guaranteed to be in every match you play.  I think adding bans can help fixing this. but dunno."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,Zeke2d,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like the issue is with the low amount of heroes to pick from in HotS because League gives six bans but there are like, what, 130 champs to choose from? In League they can ban Ezreal Corki Ziggs, but I can still pick up Xerath for poke if I wanted. In HotS there's KT and Jaina for your traditional mage class, that's it.   I mean, I'm sick of seeing the same heroes over and over again, but right now, the low hero pool gimps strategic diversity. I'm mostly salty about my Stitches and Brightwing though."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,Kaeoz,2,Tue Jul 21 18:54:07 2015 UTC,"How about letting blizzards design team decide in an unbiased manner whether having bans in hero league actually makes it more fun.

Why should someone who is a one trick pony be precluded from playing hero league?   Bans add more depth to the team and overall strategy of the game.     Really? Does it make it more fun though? Nah lets not think about that. Let's instead add another mechanic that adds depth just because and doing depth is automatically good. Like if you get the killing blow on a minion your hero increases his stats by 0.25%. This makes it so people who have good spacing and zoning are rewarded and that positioning becomes more deep. Sounds like it would be FUN."

That's because wow has 9 classes.  They DO have map bans in RBGs   Why not? No seriously. Why should someone who is a one trick pony be precluded from playing hero league?   Because hero league is a competive team environment.  If you can only play one character well, and that character gets chosen by someone else, then that is a huge detriment to your team.  It matters what is best for the team, not the individual player.  If you just want to play one character really well, then play in QM.   Really? Does it make it more fun though?   I agree, depth =!= fun.  However, banning 2 characters that define the current meta will yield more interesting games and make the teams think more about composition than just getting the 2 FOTM(Flavor of the month) heroes."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,tehtiny,12,Tue Jul 21 18:15:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those ""shitty"" mobas happen to be the biggest games ever played, Dota being the most played game on Steam and the game you all love to hate on, League of Legends, is the biggest game in the planet right now.  I'm sure they can learn a thing or two from them."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,Ruhnie,3,Tue Jul 21 15:52:38 2015 UTC,"One really good reason is that this isn't the same game as other MOBAs. In fact, I hate every other MOBA I've ever played, this is the first one that's really been enjoyable to me. The key differences b/w hots and the others are the exact reason I like it so much. Moving things towards the way the other games work is a negative IMO. I prefer HL over QM b/c of the draft and not dealing with the shit matchmaking, but if they implement bans I'm probably out. Worst case, they would need to add an unranked draft mode."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,tehtiny,2,Tue Jul 21 16:32:33 2015 UTC,"Adding bans benefit the game in every way, it forces diversity.  and sorry if it sounds mean, but if you're planning to quit the game if they add bans. then you better plan early, because adding it to HL is inevitable and the only logical choice."

They want Hero League to be ""quick ranked matches"" and Team League to be serious business. Anything they have said about bans has been referencing Team League. Adding bans to Hero League ups the hero requirement to 12 (or 14 if 2 bans) and slows the draft down."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,NSAFedora,3,Tue Jul 21 14:02:33 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't see it happening for Hero League primarily because of solo queue, unless they devise a way to make sure the most experienced player gets to select the ban and first pick. Otherwise draft phase becomes even more of a salt mine than it already is.  And even in this best-case scenario, new players will still be salty they don't get to have a say in the ban.

heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,Skanchorman,-3,Tue Jul 21 16:05:04 2015 UTC,"Game gets very stale if the same pool of 10-12 heroes are picked (with no bans people will usually just pick the ""best"" heroes available).  Bans allow for more heroes to see play, and also for more types of comps/strats to evolve.  For example, DotA has 10 heroes total banned (5 bans for each team) and the bans are interspersed throughout the entire draft.  Out of the 100+ heroes, only maybe 20 or so don't see competitive play, so you see a lot of hero variety."

heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,LegendReborn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:15 2015 UTC,"How does it make no sense? It allows you to preemptively take out counters or limit hero choices made by the other team. Additionally, some of us play at a level where we do see people we've played against or with before."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,blergh_1,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:05:56 2015 UTC,the ratio of benefit/drama is too imho.... and while some of us indeed play at a level where you can play same ppl over and over majority does not...
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,Radulno,-5,Tue Jul 21 14:08:51 2015 UTC,"And yet LoL, Dota2 and Smite handle having bans just fine. I don't see why HotS shouldn't have bans to reduce assholes being assholes. You shouldn't skimp on better gameplay because of a few people. If they are toxic, ban them."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,blergh_1,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:13 2015 UTC,it's not only about toxicity... it's about usefulness. this feature is basically almost useless in more than 99% of times... even on rank 1 you've got many many games where lobbies are silent and I just don't think that bans will add anything valuable to HL experience.  if you want proper comps and ban strats then Blizz will have a place for that all it takes is to find 4 like minded ppl
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,diction203,-4,Tue Jul 21 14:22:08 2015 UTC,How does it works on these games ? Who decides who to ban ? Is there a vote or only one player decide ?
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,bampirelu,5,Tue Jul 21 14:18:07 2015 UTC,"depends on game i guess, in LoL first pick bans."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,DingDongDaddio,2,Tue Jul 21 14:19:52 2015 UTC,I don't think it works in HL as you have no leader to pick the bans.
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,bampirelu,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:02:15 2015 UTC,"It would be hilarious to see the 5 members of a random queue in HL deciding on who to ban...; in HL, given the fact that 5man is being removed, this could just become an additional flaming subject..."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,blergh_1,3,Tue Jul 21 13:55:00 2015 UTC,"It works just fine in League of Legends. First pick on each team is ""captain"" and selects the bans. You get a minute to discuss with your teammates.  HL should be competitive and represent the competitive style. There's a reason both HL and QM exist separately. On top of that, it's just a standard. It's expected.  I really prefer League's approach to this type of stuff. Blizzard just wants to coddle and restrict the players, putting foam on all the little corners so we don't stub our toesies. League just punishes the bozos and does all it can to encourage good behavior without removing features."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,abbzug,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:24 2015 UTC,"I am not familiar with LoL, therefore I was not aware of this; what you are saying it's ok in theory and I think it's the best way they could implement this in HL; but even with the leader deciding the ban, the flaming will be real and I guess it happens a lot in LoL as well. Imagine the classic stubborn guy who won't pick any other hero but the one that's his main, being in the leader spot, and the other 4 people just trying to convince him to pick a certain ban. The main (and I guess the only) flaming topic within the HL draft faze at the moment is Hero Pick (tier, type and so on), adding the ban will only provide a second flaming topic. It is a good thing and adds to the competitive side for sure, especially at the higher MMRs, just that I think it's purpose is served best in 5 premade."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,JessicaSc2,-5,Tue Jul 21 14:29:06 2015 UTC,how it ends up working in LoL is you get some salt sometimes but most bans are usual meta bans anyway matching current fotm champion - adds big fat zero to the game for pick up teams
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,j_rackham,7,Tue Jul 21 14:53:37 2015 UTC,"People sometimes grumble about ban picks in LoL, but I can count on no fingers how many times it's ever been a significant contributor to toxicity."
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,stylepoints99,2,Tue Jul 21 14:45:01 2015 UTC,please add them to HL as well.
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,LegendReborn,3,Tue Jul 21 13:23:32 2015 UTC,"It could be a fun idea, but I don't know how it could work and how well could it work in HL"
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,SouthBranchRenous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:32:22 2015 UTC,The same way it works in every other game in the genre. Let first picks ban 2.  They also need to add hero trading.
heroesofthestorm,3e2e2n,JessicaSc2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:52:12 2015 UTC,Or just position trading. Doesn't require people to have heroes for trading and creates less issues with people needing to just buy heroes purely for trading (something I did a lot in LoL since I'm a support main).

That would imply that they intend to betray him from the start, in fact they actually really did love their king until he turned mad, they even felt bad for killing him.

heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,zIRaXor,4,Tue Jul 21 10:16:05 2015 UTC,I think the mad king would be a much more fitting parallel. The point with Stannis is that very few people liked him despite his worthiness.

Honestly, after four years of what he went through, his anger probably welled down a bit to remorse and sickly wanting to get old Kerrigan back.

heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,vonBoomslang,2,Tue Jul 21 13:53:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wonder how it would work if he changed unit types when he died once, from zealot to dragoon (with the even deaths possibly resetting him to zealot.  Could be a really interesting mechanic, but it could also be too asymmetrical.  However, since they set the precedent with Abby and Murky being in the game, it's possible we could see something really different."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,dysp_,4,Tue Jul 21 12:45:56 2015 UTC,It would totally mess up your talent builds. It woulnd't work.
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,vonBoomslang,2,Tue Jul 21 13:53:15 2015 UTC,"It's possible to have dual talents that affect both modes in similar themes, potentially making him a fairly complex character. It might be a balancing challenge, but he could be quite unique. I suppose the idea would be focused around the trade-offs of death, similar to Gathering Power characters and the Butcher, but then adding a possible upside. His pacing would be drastically different than other heroes.   Then again, it might be a rubbish idea. Choosing to suicide into the enemy just to switch modes would be a rather unfun mechanic. If he did switch unit types on death, it'd probably have to be something quick like an Uther ghost or a long cooldown death escape. I don't know right now. He has quite a few interesting possibilities."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,dysp_,3,Tue Jul 21 14:23:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe he changes at death most of the time, but he has a Heroic that lets him change at will, as well. Thus, on a moderate cooldown, Fenix can just change into the opposite form (and is healed in the process).  Another option is to let Fenix's deaths count for less XP - say 50% - 75% to allow him to change between forms with less  of a penalty."

heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,jayme0227,62,Tue Jul 21 13:46:43 2015 UTC,That was hilarious.
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,pateras,18,Tue Jul 21 14:37:19 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Illidan The Betrayer, Zagara who betrayed Kerrigan, Arthas who betrayed his father and Kerrigan who betrayed her allies during Brood War. Seems pretty loyal to me there Leoric!"
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,Kaiser499,13,Tue Jul 21 09:13:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah...Illidan's face is just like ""The wut now? Betrayer is my middle name, for realz!"""
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,Sirah81,6,Tue Jul 21 11:35:09 2015 UTC,"Arthas turns his head too, it's just fairly subtle but you can tell he's having a similar thought"
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,Alfakillr,5,Tue Jul 21 12:23:12 2015 UTC,"When did Zagara betray Kerrigan?  I mean, she fought against Kerrigan when the latter returned because she was ordered to do so: before Kerrigan was captured, she told all brood mothers to only follow the strongest - Kerrigan was captured, Zagara survived and continued fighting. To Zagara's pre-abarthur'd mind that likely meant that she is a stronger leader than Kerrigan."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,Fharlion,4,Tue Jul 21 12:05:09 2015 UTC,"At the first few missions of HoTS, Zagara did betray Kerrigan, she tried to kill her to prevent her from ever reuniting the Swarm and take it for her own. But spoiler alert it flopped and she recognized Kerrigan's power and decided to follow her again."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,Colouss,3,Tue Jul 21 13:31:05 2015 UTC,That is what I am talking about - Kerrigan told her to do that before she was turned into a human.
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,Fharlion,3,Tue Jul 21 14:17:12 2015 UTC,"She followed Kerrigan's orders to fight her, that's why Kerrigan lets her live."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,Oops_killsteal,2,Tue Jul 21 14:51:26 2015 UTC,Yeah. I never really felt like Zagara betrayed Kerrigan. It was more like a battle for who would be Queen and Kerrigan just happened to win.
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,twatpire,55,Tue Jul 21 14:53:39 2015 UTC,"I like how it fits with his character too. In Diablo 3, it becomes clear the only person he trusted was Lazarus, who was literally the only one who betrayed him."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,floatablepie,18,Tue Jul 21 16:14:58 2015 UTC,So nobody is talking about illidan having his the frozen throne / burning crusade appearance in this trailer instead of his appearance before he consumed the skull of gul'dan?  also notice: this is not his metamorphosis skin
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,Amazing_Dobe,7,Tue Jul 21 09:05:03 2015 UTC,Hoping so bad this is not just a random occurrence but might actually be his new master skin.
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,Frydendahl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:04:04 2015 UTC,"I hope it won't be like ""for only 9,99€ you can get illidan's newest skin!"". But it probably will.  It could also be a event skin once we'll get a warcraft event or be part of some unannounced alternative skins you don't have to buy but will get on another way. I know it seems unlikely but one can dream"
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,Monrar,7,Tue Jul 21 10:13:46 2015 UTC,"That would be sick, but im afraid it is just metamorphosis update to make it look different with skins :("

Sure, it is his Metamorphosis form, but it's not black. The big question is, why would Blizzard insert Illidan in his Meta form into a trailer? I'm betting it's a new, seperate skin."

heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,bonerjohnson,8,Tue Jul 21 10:49:29 2015 UTC,"Kael was pretty damn cool in Frozen Throne. I like his Alliance with Illidan as well. Would have preferred that Bliz took both of their stories in a different direction. The Illidan / Kael / Vashj group could have been a cool faction on their own. I never thought any of them were necessarily outright evil cackling villains, they were just all making really bad decisions that they thought were beneficial.   But nope. Ultimately all slaves to the legion."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,EasterlyFan,3,Tue Jul 21 11:37:30 2015 UTC,"Before BK came out i was hoping to see third faction added to the game - Blood Elves, Nagas and Draenei... Even 10 years later i still hope to see Demon Hunters and Nagas to become playable, but seems Blizzard are too busy adding some bullshit story retcons and ridiculous time-travels :\"
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,Grockr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:21:22 2015 UTC,"Haven't played WoW since Cataclysm,but yeah, there was a lot I wanted to see in BC and Wrath that unfortunately never happened. The third faction would have been epic, in my opinion. Blood Elves, Naga and Draenei (not the attractive Alliance ones) based in Outland. Could have been really cool, and that faction could have had a really cool story. Illidan / Lady Vashj and Kael leading a third faction, Demon Hunters as their faction specific class (and kept Paladin / Shaman faction specific). That's what I was hoping for, unfortunately it never came to be."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,EasterlyFan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:28:33 2015 UTC,"That'd be a nightmare to balance in terms of locations and everything. There's a reason Blizz did away with faction-unique classes.  Now a mercenary style like what the Pandaren have (choose Horde or Alliance after starting zone) would be perfect. Still, no reason the Naga would be Demon Hunters when Night Elves are the actual ones."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t7d,AstorSapolsky,8,Tue Jul 21 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"It absolutely would be unbearable for Blizz, I don't deny that. I'm just talking about all the dreams I had at the time haha.  If Dwarves can be Shaman and Undead Paladins, then I think Naga as Demon Hunters under Illidan could have worked. :P"

heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,kiruso,65,Tue Jul 21 11:04:17 2015 UTC,Woah slow down. The technology requried to do that is simply nowhere near ready.
heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,Kalulosu,22,Tue Jul 21 06:37:18 2015 UTC,"They don't have the technology to remove that delay when you press Level Up on try-mode as well, that delay is killing us blizzard, killing us!"
heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,MiteCrow,18,Tue Jul 21 06:52:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, just removing that delay would fix most of the complaints about Try mode. If you can level up by mass-clicking it doesn't matter that you'd have to reset level just to change a talent (and it wouldn't require changing much of the UI or whatever)."
heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,Kalulosu,9,Tue Jul 21 09:16:22 2015 UTC,I'd be happy with a raise level to 30 button. Should be doable.
heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,Grumbul,3,Tue Jul 21 11:40:02 2015 UTC,Yeah that seems like a very reasonable solution (or at least 20).
heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,Kalulosu,2,Tue Jul 21 12:10:57 2015 UTC,"Didn't people say it used to work that way, but caused some bugs occasionally? I heard they added the delay to prevent the issues it cased by spamming it. I don't have a source though, so take this with a grain of salt."
heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,ProfessionalSlackr,2,Tue Jul 21 12:23:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can understand that you'd end up double clicking real quick, so /u/MiteCrow's solution seems like the best answer actually!"
heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,Kalulosu,6,Tue Jul 21 12:25:32 2015 UTC,Or they can just make the talent menu always selectable instead of locking in your choice.
heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,I_cut_my_own_jib,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:03 2015 UTC,"Except that would mean changing that part, while adding a ""lvl me to 20/30"" button would ceretainly be easier and not disruptive to any other feature."
heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,infiniti2,2,Tue Jul 21 18:21:40 2015 UTC,"I might get shat on for saying this, but I think you should be able to change a talent in an actual game, BUT ONLY IF:  1) If you change the talent within 5 seconds (or whatever would make blizz feel good) of your original talent selection.  2) If you use a spell, cast an autoattack, take damage, or are in any form of combat during this 5 second grace period, the talent you selected gets locked in.  3) If you collect any item, including a coin, skull, or health globe, the talent also gets locked in.  4) If you are currently holding a map objective (shrines, temples, etc) or channeling a map objective (tribute, getting dragon), your original talent selection get locked in.  I don't want people changing talents to get an advantage.  I simply want to change talents when I accidentally pick the wrong one, especially since (as far as I know) you can't pick talents purely through the keyboard psyche, you can.  Sometimes I slightly miss-aim my mouse and choose the wrong one."
heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,I_cut_my_own_jib,4,Tue Jul 21 13:27:19 2015 UTC,"You can press ctrl-1 through whatever to select a talent. I think I'm more error prone when I do this, though"

heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,majohnny,5,Tue Jul 21 11:06:40 2015 UTC,Just go vs ai. They don't help unless you ping.
heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,thexcuriousxwanderer,3,Tue Jul 21 12:45:44 2015 UTC,You need to level to to that point normally then though
heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,TXKSSnapper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:18:51 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if they could let us do the try mode with respect to a specific map. Sometimes I just want to test out creep spawns at a certain time at a certain level ...

heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,Torlen,4,Tue Jul 21 09:09:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if we want to try out 2 or 3 different build, it takes time, is really frustrating."
heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,ProfessionalSlackr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:33:28 2015 UTC,I'd just like a confirmation in case I fat finger the wrong talent. Man that's a game ruiner.
heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,Torlen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:15:56 2015 UTC,At least it's only try mode. Yesterday I fat fingered a talent that wasn't ignite while playing Kael in ranked.

heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,mrpeters93,2,Tue Jul 21 18:23:52 2015 UTC,This seems like one of those things that makes a lot of sense and sounds really easy to change but in reality would take a significant amount of time to implement. I'm no game dev though....
heroesofthestorm,3e1gmp,Exvaris,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:14:32 2015 UTC,If it takes them a significant amount of time to implement that then they need better programmers.

heroesofthestorm,3e2vr4,CMK1982,2,Tue Jul 21 16:30:39 2015 UTC,"No bloody clue. I did some googling to find out who they were, and got nothing useful.   According to the HotS wiki, the angelic immortal is called Ilarian and was originally a servant of Tyrael. The demonic immortal Beleth was an overseer that served under Diablo. However, I couldn't find any reference to either name when trying to find them in the Diablo universe. Frustrating to realize that they were just retconned."
heroesofthestorm,3e2vr4,InfernalInsanity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"Ilarian is unrepresented in Diablo lore as far as I know, but Beleth exists in Diablo continuity. He was added back in April as part of patch 2.2 for Diablo 3 (maybe in anticipation of his inclusion in HotS)."

The description for the skin is   With tired eyes the newly appointed High Seraph Tyrael looked across Sanctuary... after the destruction of the High Heavens, this world was the last bastion against Imperius's wrath.   It would seem to me that Ilarian either a Seraph (not just an angel in this context, but a different rank of angel), or was appointed the high Seraph in Tyrael's stead after Tyrael fell."

Most people speculate it's either a second expansion or a DLC of some short.  As you may remember at the end of RoS all the evils are released running rampant on the world once again. It's quite probable we will see Mephisto on the spotlight for once.  In blizzard's leaked schedule (confirmed to be true) a D3 2nd Expansion was on that schedule.
heroesofthestorm,3e2vr4,jmcgit,3,Tue Jul 21 17:54:37 2015 UTC,"Blizzard's internal schedule was ages old, though, and things could easily change.  We don't even know for a fact that they're still planning a second expansion.  They might prefer a fresh start, a Diablo IV, rather than an expansion, for example.  They could also be focusing their resources on other projects, such as Hearthstone, Heroes, and Overwatch, and might be letting Diablo sit for now."
heroesofthestorm,3e2vr4,twatpire,2,Tue Jul 21 18:36:24 2015 UTC,That's why its just a rumor ^^

Hmn Diablo 4 is unlikely since it means making a new engine, classes, lore, design, etc.  D3 2nd expansion would cost a lot less and provide more profit so it wouldn't be a bad idea as far as they can generate profit out of it."
heroesofthestorm,3e2vr4,Tomcii,3,Tue Jul 21 18:50:22 2015 UTC,"A second expansion is definitely coming, although I feel it's going to be announced at BlizzCon rather than gamescom again.

heroesofthestorm,3e2vr4,HireALLTheThings,5,Tue Jul 21 16:32:57 2015 UTC,"As the embodiment of valor, Imperius would be well-suited to the warrior role.  He should be aggressive and fearless, the first to rush into the fray and the last to retreat."
heroesofthestorm,3e2vr4,Schmedes,6,Tue Jul 21 17:29:35 2015 UTC,"The issue there is that Tyrael is already filling that role. If Blizzard were going to go that route with Imperius, I imagine that they'd just make him a high-quality skin job instead."

I'm sure they could brainstorm and figure it out, but I do think it would be pretty cool and unique!  It would even be cool to have an alternate Diablo skin like his D3 model."
heroesofthestorm,3e3bw1,Tomcii,2,Tue Jul 21 18:25:53 2015 UTC,"Every Skin that's ever gonna be made should still represent the unique sillhoutte of each hero, at least to a certain extent.

He accepted his full angelic power back, with the conditions that he remain mortal, and that he would be able to choose his successor from the people of Sanctuary.""

heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,jieling,2,Tue Jul 21 13:28:43 2015 UTC,"I don't tihnk that's it. The ""honest"" rating was ""Worth-Playing/10"", which just means that there's no meaning to give a X/10, it depends on people. It's very hard to define objectively how to rate an entertainment product. You have some measures (is it a broken piece of shit or not, is it a scam or not, etc, etc), but it's hard to distinguish past that, what does that mean? It means ratings are subjective, and ""worth playing"" just means they had fun and think people should try it out because it's worth it."
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,Kalulosu,2,Tue Jul 21 13:34:01 2015 UTC,"fair enough and I agree with that 100%. I have a ton of fun in this game, I enjoy the pro-games, I think the heroes are creative and fun and the pace of development is keeping me optimistic. I just hate to see the circlejerk in this subreddit about matchmaking sucking, balance being oh so bad, reconnect being so bad, stutter being so bad, etc. etc. when I have none of these problems and it just sounds like the community getting into this negative spiral that's not doing anyone any favors. It drowns out interesting discussion because apparently the consensus is that 90% of the game is ""fucking broken"".   It's nice to see my assessment of the game reflected in this score, but a lot of people in this thread seem to disagree that hots is a great game."
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,jieling,4,Tue Jul 21 13:42:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is just people on the Internet being vocal. You're always more vocal when you're unhappy with something, so that's why you're seeing those complaints. That's even exacerbated by the team aspect of HotS: people will find it so easy to say ""yeah well X hero is OP so I lost because of that"" or ""yeah matchmaking sucks I am matched with losers but I'm good, but I can't win alone!""  Don't pay too much attention to that, and remember that, while it may get old seeing the same complaints over and over again, the reverse (i.e. full-on positive circlejerk ""Blizzard dindu nuffin' wrong"") is just as bad to read, and even more detrimental to the game (if no one points out the problems, Blizzard won't have the same drive to work on them - doesn't they wouldn't, but it helps when the community is able to pinpoint what issues matter the most to it).  Also I feel that most people in this thread actually agree that HotS is pretty great, they just feel that it may not deserve 9/10 because that's a rating that's pretty close to perfection, and there's always room to improve. But all that boils down to what I'm trying to say: rating X/10 is bound to be wrong for many reasons, and makes little sense. It's just convenient and video game journalism hasn't strayed away from that (although Polygon - I think? - said they would recently!) because no one got really vocal about it."

heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,joebenet,84,Tue Jul 21 14:17:47 2015 UTC,"I tried Dota and LoL but the learning curve seemed too steep.  HotS was super easy to pick up and it's been the first MOBA that I've played and enjoyed.  I'm sure Dota and LoL are great games, but I just couldn't get into them."
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,MelonMelon28,42,Tue Jul 21 13:52:55 2015 UTC,"After enjoying HoTS, I decided to try LoL just because I know LoL has a bigger following than HoTS and is more complicated. I just don't think I could enjoy LoL after playing HoTS first. LoL just had so many weird gameplay mechanics like having to tag creeps last to get gold that it just wasn't fun. Also, the games took wayyy too long, and the maps felt too large. I get that if you're used to these sorts of mechanics, it probably is enjoyable and makes the game more challenging, but to me it seems like HoTS gets rid of a lot of the tedious aspects of other MOBAs."
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,Secon2,-10,Tue Jul 21 15:17:59 2015 UTC,"Same, I do still enjoy watching Dota2/LoL pro games as there is a lot more going on around the map when you have pros (jungle, actually doing some bosses, lots more gank attempts, some pretty clever teamwork) and commentary provided during downtime is usually enjoyable but whenever I try playing it, it's so slow-paced, it takes so much time to get anywhere and before you can even attempt anything (at least at my shitty level).  HotS is really arcade-ish, maps are small, lots of stuff to do, objectives you cannot ignore, fights are unavoidable, games are much shorter but there is a lot of action even during QM and it's usually satisfying enough that even if you lose, there had to be a few moments here and there where you had fun ... you didn't wait 15 minutes half-asleep, trying to last hit mobs and wait for the next wave to follow :)"
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,ravenouscraving,20,Tue Jul 21 18:05:27 2015 UTC,the best compliment I could give it is that it sucked me right in. It's very inviting for nubs but I think provides some depth for experienced players. I tried lol and Dota and didn't like either one. Some friends badgered me into trying hits and despite me thinking I just didn't like mobas I gave it a shot. Now I play every chance I can. I still am not very good but it's just fun anyway

At best I would do it 6/10 by this point. 3-4 years ago the game deserved at least a 9, maybe even a 9.5, but since then, its gone downhill fast. They don't develop for the game anymore. Just make balance changes (Which introduce game breaking bugs without fail) and produce skins for people to buy.  When I was playing Hots I was mind blown that a game that just left beta had things that Riot has promised us 5 years ago. We have replays (Which league only has through a 3rd party software). We have FREE chroma packs, which Riot just implemented for a insane price. We have master skins. We have mastery rewards. We have AI for DC'ed people. We have level progression rewards.  Hots is way better then League of Legends simply due to the fact that it has better features. There are very few missing things (Namely, in game voice chat, pings show up on map, and bans/champ swap for Hero League) but they have way more then League did on their release."

I could never really get into either because it seemed like such an upfront effort to eventually have fun. When I played Dota it always seemed like a creative take on an RTS. Heroes doesn't have that feel."

heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,ChiefEmann,7,Tue Jul 21 13:34:42 2015 UTC,"For me the best thing about HoTS will always be that I can pick up a hero and play it.  I don't have to make a rune page, I don't have to make a talents page, I don't have to figure out a buy order, I just get to play.  You could argue that I have to learn a talent build to min/max but if you just picked up a hero you should be in AI or at most QM games and it is ok to experiment in those settings.  In fact, everyone should experiment with builds before finding out what hotslogs says everyone else is doing.  Also, no last hit for full reward mechanic is very nice.  That was my least favorite thing in LoL.  Odd that I enjoy Azmodan so much now..."

I think the rune system is one of the most subtly exploitative systems I've ever seen in a free-to-play game."

heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,SaturdayMorningSwarm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:43:30 2015 UTC,"Well, they add gold rewards every other patch for a reason. The grind is bigger than all the games in the genre(maybe excluding LoL, but that has been released for 5 years now) and the prices are pretty high as well."
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,BreadandSalt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:51:46 2015 UTC,"You say ""excluding LoL,"" but LoL is the only other game in the genre even close to prominent that is using a grind model. On top of that, the grind's really not that bad. You get enough gold for a mid-tier priced champion just from finishing the tutorials, you get(currently, this number will only grow) 19000 gold(excluding quest and win money even) just for playing every character to level 5 as they come on free rotation, you get a further 750 gold per character for the easily reachable 9th level goal, you get daily quests and events like the Treasure Goblin to supplement your gold income, the amount of gold you get per match for time spent is pretty balanced, and stimpacks actually feel impactful and important, unlike in LoL. As far as grinds go, the HotS one is incredibly forgiving and generous.  Reconnecting is an actual issue, but that's about the only one you've named. The spectator mode problem is one that's plagued the genre forever and will get worked out as the game goes forward, it's always been backburner issue for the bulk of players. Frame drops if your network spikes is hardly a HotS only problem and is something I experienced frequently with LoL, DotA 2, and Smite. ""Missing a ton of heroes"" is subjective, the roster is rounding out pretty nicely."
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,ProxyReBorn,3,Tue Jul 21 03:07:54 2015 UTC,"If you actually get a chance to knock your dailies out once very 1-3 days, you get gold faster than you can actually spend it on 10k heroes isn't that right?  I've bought a 7k hero and a 10k hero since the Butcher patch, and I didn't really have much gold saved up.  So I'm unlocking faster than they're being released.  Unlike LoL, where something like half a dozen got released before I finished a rune page (they also basically patched the runes I was aiming for out of the meta, so that's nice)."
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,SaturdayMorningSwarm,5,Tue Jul 21 04:31:35 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, unless you just have terrible luck and only pull 200 gold quests every day. And that's without even using a booster. The amount of gold you make with consistent play in this game is ridiculous. It's a very generous system with a lot of paid cosmetic rewards worth pursuing, and you don't have to worry about anything like buying runes and rune pages instead of a character. The grind in HotS compared to LoL is practically non-existent."

heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,BreadandSalt,0,Tue Jul 21 05:50:22 2015 UTC,"If you play HotS and just do dailies, you'll get about 400 gold per day (500 with the goblin but who knows how long that's going to last). That means 4 weeks to get a 10k hero.   Gold from leveling to 5 helps but that dries up quicker than most people are willing to admit."
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,StephenColbert46,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:14:02 2015 UTC,the leveling gold is still a huge bonus in comparison as well as not needing runes/pages.
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,br1ggsy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:30:29 2015 UTC,"Runes were the worst part for me. Getting top class runes is expensive, nevermind buying extra rune pages. And in theory, to play everyone optimally, you'd need to own a full set of every or nearly every T3 rune. I gave up way before that point. Even with a lot of money invested in the game and a lot of time spent grinding back before I quit, I don't think I had more than at most half of the roster, and probably less than that. Part of that is the sheer size of it, but the Heroes gold grind and daily quests both make me feel like owning the whole roster is an attainable goal and an actually worthwhile one."
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,StephenColbert46,0,Tue Jul 21 05:59:14 2015 UTC,"I hate it when people say ""the grind isn't bad if you just level every hero to 5"".

heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,br1ggsy,4,Tue Jul 21 06:06:01 2015 UTC,"I like the system personally. I've made it a goal to get champions to 5 when they come on free week, and I've learnt about those champions in the process as well as getting the gold.  It's a fairly polished game they released for free, if you want to play it without putting any money in at all, blizzard aren't obliged to make that process quick and easy. Otherwise who would pay for champions?"
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,BreadandSalt,0,Tue Jul 21 09:32:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah there's absolutely no way to monetize without making players buy heroes. That Dota 2 game was going broke the last I heard.   And it's not that playing every hero is a bad thing, it's just that waiting for every hero to be on rotation will take months so it's not as time saving as people claim."

heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,jeremynsl,2,Tue Jul 21 15:36:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything other than the Stimpacks being useful.  There have been other reddit posts that examined this, and unless you are on the absolute extreme end of grinding you may not get much value out of the stimpack.  Of course that is concerning gold gain.  Perhaps they can be useful for XP gain but IMO you can hit level 40 so fast that gaining XP faster is just a waste."
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,manatwork01,2,Tue Jul 21 05:30:00 2015 UTC,"Well, the XP gain applies to heroes, which is huge. It means you're making level 9 in half the time, thus reaching that 750 gold boost, as well as ranking up quickly to unlock skin and mount tints+Master Skins even after you've developed a huge gold surplus. The gold gain is nice, but it's really the smallest factor in what makes stimpacks so great in this game. You don't need them for Player XP, you need them for individual hero XP, especially if you can get a holiday bonus stacked up on there with it. That's 300,000-500,000 EXP a game during holiday weekends, which is simply massive."
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,mykolas5b,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:35:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, I realize the new level 9 gold is a new wrinkle in the Stimpack math.  I'll let someone who has more time than I do to crunch the math to figure out whether it really makes it that much more worthwhile."

heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,showroom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:08:51 2015 UTC,Well it's still faster for a casual player than LoL since HotS has daily quests and all the income can be spent solely on heroes.

If you make your account lvl40 and get all free rotation heroes to lvl5 you can access your favorite heroes pretty quick."
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,Siphon1,2,Tue Jul 21 10:12:26 2015 UTC,"The reconnect system could greatly be improved.... But atleast you have a bot that can do SOMETHING while you are DC'ed. In League your fucked because by the time you get back, your 5 levels behind with ZERO hope of catching up because they can 1 shot you.  Frame drops if your network spikes is not different then having your champion teleport back to where he was or many different way that all games handle LAG. Its just a different visual representation.  Spectator mode is needed.  The game released in july from its beta? Its got plenty of time for more heroes.  The grinding curve isn't nearly as big given that every single character will give you gold simply for playing them a bit, and daily quests can be saved if you miss that day. Compared to League the grinding curve is even less. You get slightly more ip in League of Legends (50 versus 20) but you have to purchase both champions and runes, which a full set for a single champion can cost 20k itself.  Cheating issues definitely need to be highest priority.  Overall, the game isn't perfect, but compared to other games, the features it offers are top notch. The fact that hero progression gives you gold rewards, and free chromas, is a huge thing."

Plus the game is boring as hell with that dumb last hit mechanic so maybe that made it feel worse.  I can earn 4K a week easy in HOTS just on dailys not to mention any gold from heros I lvl up.  Reconnect only matters if you live in africa on a 14.4 modem.  server lag is a minor ish that occurs maybe once a week.  As for cheating I haven't encountered any so it seems highly sensationalized to me.    9.25 is too high I agree with that match making is still broke for me.

Then the 6.5 would be considered above average, and that's good and I can totally see HOTS being a 6.5 if you want to compare its depth to other games. And the 9.5 would be considered practically perfect which its not. At the end of the day the circlejerk over how IGN is dumb and the 6.5 is stupid completely glosses over the points the author made in giving that score. IGN has been blasted all these years that nobody cares about their scores so it makes no sense why people would suddenly care about IGN's score for this particular game except tons of people in the HOTS community want to defend this game when people really don't give a shit. IGN probably gave that guy a pat on the back when his article brought in an additional 500k hits because of the controversy."

The game regularly connects me to US8 when i live in florida, in which US8 is located in california, more distance = higher ping. Literally every other game i can connect to servers near myself and get double digit pings. Triple digit pings are going to be common in that scenario. Until you can pick which specific server you want to connect to this will always be an issue.  Peak times also exacerbate this issue, since pings will naturally be higher in high-traffic times of the day.  This wouldn't even be an issue if the game didn't use lockstep networking, but that's what happens when they decided to use the SC2 engine. Great for an RTS, not so much for this type of game."
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,DRACULA_WOLFMAN,0,Tue Jul 21 07:29:22 2015 UTC,I hear you. I am talking from a german/european perspective and all our servers are (from what i know) located in ireland. Possibly in paris or frankfurt as well. does not matter either way: Distances are miniscule compared to the US east to west coast. I think this should be adressed first then: Have us players decide where to connect. Don't know how feasible this is and whether this would bring up other issues. But lockstep networking is less of an issue with lower ping...
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,Hjortur95,0,Tue Jul 21 10:13:26 2015 UTC,"Length between server and user is not directly in touch with the ping the user gets. It also depends on the transmitter-computers the servers are working with and the kind of the cable that is being used.  Nevertheless, it could be bad in your case. People playing LoL in the NA servers usually have a similar complaint."

heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,Carighan,4,Tue Jul 21 00:19:47 2015 UTC,"Well, it's hero balance could be better, but since the heroes feel more unique than other MOBAs (I couldn't even tell you why, if I compare heroes straight up they're not, I suspect their setting in the maps is what makes them feel that way as it creates plenty situations where your hero is objectively stronger and objectively weaker) it doesn't seem to matter as much as in other games.  Subjectively, that is. I don't mind the imbalance as much as I do in DotA2."
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,gtemi,-4,Tue Jul 21 07:22:05 2015 UTC,but since the heroes feel more unique than other MOBAs    Can you explain this?  I've been enjoying Heroes a lot recently but the hero diversity doesn't even come close to Dota.
heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,zouhair,17,Tue Jul 21 14:50:51 2015 UTC,"Well, as I said in the other lines, I don't know why but they feel like they're more diverse, comparing DotA2. I reckon it's because there's no common pool of items providing such a large portion of my build and power (and hence my hero has a greater share of what I can or cannot do), coupled with the variety of maps providing more situations where my hero is individually weaker or stronger.  But cannot perfectly put it into words. Just feels more varied."

heroesofthestorm,3e0bb7,ontographer,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:12:35 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to compare HOTS with other MOBAs like LoL.  You can compare GW2 and WoW, but really, how good can that comparison really be?  I enjoy both games.  I tried LoL 3 years ago and absolutely hated it, the games were too long and the combat was way too fast for me.  The game is huge and I didn't have the time for it.  I felt extremely overwhelmed.  I got into the Alpha for HOTS and gave it a try, and while it was better, I still wasn't a huge fan.  A few months back, some guildies picked it up and for some reason it clicked for me, and I was addicted.  I gave LoL another chance since I had a newfound love for the MOBA genre and I instantly fell in love with LoL, partially because of the large game and multitude of mechanics, but also the eSports scene.  Not to say HOTS can't do this, but at the moment, LoL is just a larger game.  I don't think anyone can dispute that.  Personally, I prefer min/maxing everything which is why I am probably leaning towards LoL moreso than HOTS.  Does that mean I don't like HOTS, or that it is a bad game? No, its a great beginner MOBA that can introduce people to a genre. And if you are already familiar with the genre, you might find that it centers around what you enjoy more.  Maybe you enjoy quicker games, or a smaller champion pool (at the moment).    I can compare a Dodge Dart to a Ford Fusion, and two people will have a different opinion even though they are very similar.  Neither one is better than the other, it's just personal preference.  Glad to see that this game was able to take off, its a fun brawler that moves quickly and I can play when I don't have an hour to commit to LoL."

heroesofthestorm,3e2k6m,its_blithe,8,Tue Jul 21 14:59:41 2015 UTC,I disagree with changing Primal Grasp to Psionic Reach and removing the Ultralisk for Planetary Invasion. I'd rather just have the Ultralisk buffed to be more like Jaina's Water Elemental.  Some of the talents are pretty nice too.
heroesofthestorm,3e2k6m,Bad_Neighbour,3,Tue Jul 21 14:41:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't mind taking Ultralisk away from Kerrigan, if only because it means that one day there could be an Ultralisk hero of its own.   There are not very many Zerg heroes which would translate over (there's pretty much just Deheka and Stukov left, and Stukov is an infested Terran rather than a true Zerg, although the overmind has come up in datamining before). Most other zerg characters in Starcraft games are blobs in SC1.  You can invent characters, like Hammer, but the thing is, most Zerg units are very basic and swarmy and tend to have a rather low life expectancy, which doesn't make them translate well as heroes. The hero version of a defiler or infestor could work, because they're spellcasters, but I can't imagine a hero hydralisk/roach/lurker/swarm host/brood lord etc ever making sense. Apart from having to redesign Zagara/Abathur to avoid confusion, it would be weird to have any of those units on their own, and what would they even do?  Ultralisks are big and powerful enough to be on-par with heroes imo and would make a seriously cool Starcraft warrior."

heroesofthestorm,3e2k6m,Torlen,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:31 2015 UTC,Yes! Melee damage done is based on hp. Zerglings die as their group hp goes down so fewer zerglings means less damage. They burrow up from the ground as they heal.

heroesofthestorm,3e2k6m,ridleyaran,2,Tue Jul 21 17:46:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Kerrigan doesn't  control one elemental or even a few. She controls the entire Zerg species. Therefore, I think a cool effect to almost give an entire wave of minions is much more suited to the character."

heroesofthestorm,3e2k6m,its_blithe,3,Tue Jul 21 14:59:03 2015 UTC,They wouldn't be exactly the same. The Ultralisk would stay how it is just have a higher health pool and not be completely useless in comparison to the Water Elemental.

The competing talents still aren't competitive either. Keep in mind that because primal grasp is an arc, increasing the range also increases the width of the grasp.

heroesofthestorm,3e2k6m,Eefan91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:45:13 2015 UTC,"I love everything about this.  The ones that shout out at me are; Induced Atrophy and Hungering Blades. These two alone would make me extremely happy!  Reversed Polarity is an interesting idea, especially for the dreadful moments when you miss the combo, pushing them away could be lifesaving. All of it definitely reminds me of SC Kerrigan, great concepts overall."
heroesofthestorm,3e2k6m,merlockqueen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:30:39 2015 UTC,i think this very well made with a lot of effort and i like almost everything but planetary invasion. i just dont thinki t fits a dps assassins kit its a Hyperion style demonic invasion an ult that pushes lane almost only belongs to specialists with the exception being Hyperion and its yamoto cannon. im not sure what you would replace it with i just dont see that one quite working with her kit.   but i love everything else about the rework some of the concepts like the impaling blades staying up after cast and slowing and doing light damage is really cool. thank you very much for posting this.
heroesofthestorm,3e2k6m,misnichek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:03 2015 UTC,"This is awesome. Would love to try that.  Notes:  As a StarCraft fan i love the new ulti, but it does not really fits hots Kerrgian since she's an assassin.  Pull/push talent sounds interesting, you can make it useful by making the push effect start further away from kerrigan, further than where the enemy hero will be placed after initial pull.  I also really like the addition of lvl 20 permanent assimilation talent. Her default shield gain is just bad. Really want to see either a straight buff to the trait, or buffed talents. But your talent works too."
heroesofthestorm,3e2k6m,Schmedes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:00:09 2015 UTC,"but it does not really fits hots Kerrgian since she's an assassin.   Meh, some assassins have talents that allow them to be partial specialists.  Tychus' level 4 grenade is a prominent one that is taken very often."

heroesofthestorm,3e2k6m,lanric,-3,Tue Jul 21 16:38:11 2015 UTC,I like this. Would love to try it out. I really think they should just increase the range of grasp by default though. it used to be sooo huge.
heroesofthestorm,3e2k6m,Demolij,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:25 2015 UTC,"I'd rather see modifications to her base kit tbh. She needs more stuff to emphasise her potent Psionic powers. Drop Pods would probably make things too confusing with Zagara also in the game, and seems similar to Azmodan's Invasion heroic. I do want an Ultralisk hero eventually though, so perhaps it could be changed to a different Zerg unit, like a Brutalisk.  I'd prefer if Impaling Blades was tweaked in such a way to make it not a short ranged version of Tyrande's stun, and maybe involved spawning lots of weak Zerglings with a short cd. Then maybe Ravage could be some sort of Psionic ability."
heroesofthestorm,3e2k6m,Handful86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think Kerrigan is in a bad spot. She has a great niche with her ambush/combo. Which can be the most satisfying combo in game to land. She can offer alot in a team fight since  W, and E are Aoe attacks. I think her biggest flaws are with her Trait, Ultralisk, and the need for generic talents(which I really don't mind). I don't play Starcraft so I don't know how lore would work."

Hell, watching people play as a Hero, any Hero, is always good to do, because you learn from their good choices as well as their mistakes/bad choices.   It's also fun to watch videos where people don't choose the current build Meta. You can see what works and what doesn't, at least for those people. For me, a good source for that is /u/Tetcher's 'All In' series on YouTube. I like to mimic those builds and see how well I can do with them, and it's often a lot of fun.

heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,Mekeji,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:53:09 2015 UTC,"If you're not moving into lanes and around the map as Abathur, you're wasting XP and time.  Abathur, especially late levels, should almost never be behind a wall.  You soak XP at your location as well as at your Symbiote's location, so you can soak xp and push two lanes at the same time.  In addition, if you went a locust build, Abathur can solo Siege Camps at level 16 (or Siege and Bruiser camps with Monstrosity at 10+) so you can safely grab camps while your team keeps the enemy distracted or applies pressure.  I can PM you one of my Hero League replays if you want to see how it's done in rewindable detail."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,Blaqkbeard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:36:27 2015 UTC,I know all that. I am more referring to him literally being in the lane rather than tucked away somewhere hidden or safe. I know playing him cowering behind the wall is losing out on xp. I'm just not so sure about actually being in plain sight.
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,Mekeji,2,Tue Jul 21 06:54:37 2015 UTC,"The problem with sitting in a bush is that you're either out of soak range or farther forward than you need to be, and you aren't actually meaningfully hidden if the person in lane with you is paying even the slightest bit of attention. Bushes are mostly useful for not showing up on the minimap when you're unopposed in the lane."

heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,dirandi,14,Mon Jul 20 23:12:57 2015 UTC,"Can an Aba main weigh in on his playstyle?  His build seemed weird to me, as well as his positioning.  I looked his HotsLogs profile, and he favors the locust build, but I'm confused about picking Ardenal Overload and Calldown: MULE.  They don't seem to fit the locust build to me and make Aba sacrifice a lot of splitpush power.   His playstyle was more confusing that his talent choices to me.  He died a couple times early on to Nazeebo, and they seemed totally unnecessary to me.  I don't get what he had to gain by exposing himself to the point of dying."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,sommerjj,6,Tue Jul 21 00:49:12 2015 UTC,"The prevalent Abathur siege build is in fact a hybrid build now. So, you go for the standard symbiote build that you always would with melee heroes on your team, but deviate after your heroic choice. As he says in the video, the main choice in his build was whether to go for Evo or Monstrosity.  He went for Mule because he was on Sky Temple, where its importance is multiplied due to the nature of the objective.  He puts himself into dangerous positions so often because Abathur's entire kit is based around him sieging and soaking xp somewhere on the map whilst also contributing in another lane. If you ever see an Abathur sit behind his tower out of range of minion xp, he's playing badly."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,Hytanthas,15,Tue Jul 21 01:00:15 2015 UTC,Can you to explain the Aba positioning more. This game style was so foreign to me because I never see it. It seems effective but I need someone to hold my hand a bit with this game style.
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,maldrame,20,Tue Jul 21 01:43:21 2015 UTC,"Basically, you have three forms of xp soak with Abathur (four if you take Monstrosity): his body, his symbiote and his locusts. On a big map like Sky Temple, constantly being aggressive in your body soak allows you to fully soak several waves, often uncontested, whilst still being in the fight for objectives and pushing with your trait.  Body soaking works by being in a radius just under a screen's width, which is made difficult instantly if your enemies allow your locusts to push with your waves.  Late game, aggressive positioning with this build is less about xp and more about letting your upgraded locusts push to your enemies' base within their duration."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,Zuology,3,Tue Jul 21 02:20:59 2015 UTC,"For fair clarification, since I frequently see players who are misinformed on the topic, Locusts and Monstrosity do not ""Soak"".  That is to say, they do not gain experience just by being in range of a minion death.  Instead, given that damage caused by summoned creatures is considered damage done by the hero, killing blows dealt by Locusts and Monstrosity still grant exp regardless of their range of the player.  Much in the same way that killing blows from Toxic Nest grant experience regardless of range."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,maldrame,6,Tue Jul 21 03:04:37 2015 UTC,"So, out of curiousity, how do summons like Gazlowe turrets and Azmodan demon lieutenants/generals of hell work? I've seen turrets collect XP as Gazlowe, so I'm just curious as to the rules of which summons do and don't collect."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,Zuology,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:27:38 2015 UTC,"Any hero damage which deals a killing blow to a minion will grant the team experience, no matter how far away the player is from the minion.  All damage dealt by hero-summoned critters are calculated as hero damage.  Thus, any killing blow dealt by a summoned unit will grant exp to the team.  This applies to any and all summoned units.  Abathur's hat is a wholly different mechanic from a Summon.  I suppose ""surrogate"" is a more accurate descriptor.  At this point in time it is the only mechanic in the game which can actively soak experience in the same manner as a hero, without actually being a hero unit itself."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,maldrame,3,Tue Jul 21 05:36:34 2015 UTC,"So the XP is only granted if the hero-summoned critter does last-hit damage, or is it any damage to the minion yielding XP? I'll have to watch more closely, but I could've sworn the turrets soaked XP from multiple sources that it didn't damage, but were within range. I could definitely be wrong, as it's a game mechanic I haven't really observed in detail in a while."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,tundranocaps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:44:36 2015 UTC,"There's a very small window wherein you can damage a minion without killing it, have the minion die from another damage source (such as another minion) and still gain experience.  Just a fraction of a second, not much space at all.  But the window does exist.  Otherwise it doesn't count.  Dealing damage to a minion without being near the killing blow has never counted towards exp gain."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,KeepYourTemper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:05:55 2015 UTC,"So the XP is only granted if the hero-summoned critter does last-hit damage, or is it any damage to the minion yielding XP?   In general, last hit only. I've seen some people say the locusts have a grace period of ~5 seconds after damaging an enemy, but didn't test it myself."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,SHAZBOT_VGS,2,Tue Jul 21 06:09:27 2015 UTC,5 seconds is way too long. The grace period for a last hit is like 0.2 seconds at best. Azmoran has the sam mechanic on his Q stacking
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,WhiteStripesWS6,4,Tue Jul 21 13:23:23 2015 UTC,so abathur body soak exp and abathur Q soak exp. It's often a great idea to toss your body in the middle of a lane(bush) in exp range of mob and help out/soak 2 lane of exp while your team is fighting. This often involve timing on your mines and to be there for the 1 sec the creep wave explode then back to your teamates fighting.

He just focuses on being safe and keeping his hat on someone at all times so according to people here he plays him badly, but we win most of our games and we both have fun so I guess what I'm saying is there's no reason you can't ease into Abathur. There's no need to go full out crazy like this immediately. :)  Once in a while we get some ""pros"" who rage when my friend doesn't body soak or do all the ""right"" things, but we just mute them and we still win and we still have fun. :p"

At least in AI mode you can try and figure him out (and how to pay that much attention to the map) without worrying that someone is hunting you.
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,inauric,9,Tue Jul 21 14:15:01 2015 UTC,Which talents did you get during this game?
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,Sickpostbro,3,Tue Jul 21 07:29:05 2015 UTC,"His playstyle is one of the more micro heavy and aggressive I've seen, and I think any Abathurs being less aggressive than him are generally doing less of an optimal job of soaking and pushing. Most Abathurs, myself included, play a lot more safe than they need to. I think the early deaths are worth the amount of weight he had in that game, no hero can avoid risk and play optimally. He absolutely could have played safer on the first couple minutes because there's no real need to go in deep for any hero, generally it's better to position aggressively during the objectives.  His picks were pretty map specific, especially Mule which is probably his best choice in Sky Temple, due to the value it can provide on objective downtime. Hybriding symbiote build and push build is pretty usual and good for Abathur especially on maps like Sky Temple and Blackhearts Bay, you don't sacrifice an awful lot of presence in teamfights or laning by going the hybrid build but focusing on one can be beneficial too. Monstrosity is absolutely amazing on Sky Temple but you can see what Ultimate Evolution did for him, saving his ass and clutching a few teamfight situations."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,technoManipulator,4,Tue Jul 21 01:26:43 2015 UTC,"His early deaths hurt early soak and a little xp for enemy team.  He could soak safely early, by letting naz push up a bit,  while he is solo lane and watched for Zeratul.   Overall that was his largest mistake in the game and the early failure made the team fall behind."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,rocqua,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:27:21 2015 UTC,"His slightly wonky forward positioning was there to ensure that he could soak XP solo while maintaining global prescense. The way locusts soak is weird, so in order to get the most XP he positioned in the middle of the lane to keep the enemies in his body's vision circle so he gets XP without having to put a hat on the wave."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,shortsteve,4,Tue Jul 21 01:10:28 2015 UTC,Is the XP soak range exactly vision range?
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,Mekhazzio,2,Tue Jul 21 11:43:11 2015 UTC,"The play style where he puts himself in danger is the optimal one. It allows Abathur to be at the most efficient (helping team and soaking lanes). Before Vikings were introduced Abathur was the only hero that could do this and it's important that you take advantage of that fact.  In order to soak lanes properly you have to expose yourself, you're going to die every once in awhile , but if you're good with your map awareness you can minimize your exposure.  In that game if Zeratul had killed aba a few more times the game would probably have swung the other way. Trikslyr made sure that he wasn't in any single lane for a very long period though so it made the enemies job more difficult in tracking him down."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,Knive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:53:28 2015 UTC,"Moving into the lane was to get soak and push at the same time.  The enemy wall is too far away to get XP from your body if you're behind your wall, so either you move out, or you push a different lane than the one your body is in, which probably wasn't happening in that game since the enemy heroes were rotating through top and mid.  Moving out was greedy, especially once Nazeebo showed he was going to be doing his work on the same lane, but it's easy to fall into patterns like that because you can get away with it fairly often.  As for level 4, none of the options are really a bad pick there.  I think Adrenal was a response to seeing that their Illidan would be doing a lot of the team's work.  I'm not sure it got much value on that game, especially since he later wound up going Ultimate Evo.  Probably Prolific Dispersal would've fit his gameplan there better and allowed for siege locusts, but that's how hindsight works.  Sustained Carapace is a decent choice if you're popping on and off your teammates frequently, but I wouldn't have put much trust in team enhancers at that point either.  MULE is a natural part of a push build.   Repairing your stuff while attacking the enemy's widens the disparity between the two teams, and it brings even more value on Sky Temple, where the lasers frequently whittle away at buildings without actually destroying them."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,lotj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:33:27 2015 UTC,"Those picks were map and team dependent. Mule because it's good on Sky Temple, Adrenal Overload because it combos great with melee assassins, especially Illidan."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,inauric,10,Tue Jul 21 04:18:31 2015 UTC,"MULE is incredibly powerful on Sky Temple and Blackheart's Bay because it helps directly negate some of the map objective's power.    Adrenal Overload is great on AA heroes (Illidan here), and even more powerful on maps where you're constantly fighting over a piece of land for a short period of time.  For both those picks the power you gain with that map and comp greatly outweigh the strength of the other talents."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,j20hundred,4,Tue Jul 21 14:47:04 2015 UTC,"Watching this live, I had to immediately subscribe to Trik, and not just because his Abathur play was off the chain.

heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,wHaCkEd2,4,Tue Jul 21 04:55:03 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, many (if not most) Abathur players just aren't at Trik's level of play.   Just yesterday in HL I was on a team with Abathur that kept sitting in one lane the whole fight (not even in exp range of minions), and pushing the same lane with his hydralisk. That was it. It was Sky Temple map and every single fight was literally 4v5. I asked the Abathur in chat to please come help that we can't play 4v5, to which he started saying ""omg noob don't know Aba"" and ""I'm a pusher, check out my siege damage noob"". Yeah, his Siege damage was nice I guess, but he really was a major contributor to us losing. :("

heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,thelemonademan,3,Tue Jul 21 08:30:44 2015 UTC,"I don't even know why they flamed him.  I guess because it's always easy to flame the abathur.  They really made all those mistakes on their own, and he couldn't have done anything except telling them what to do.  First temple: they lost it because they were greedy for both. Fight: Not fully grouped and Jaina seemed out of position, considering she died so quick. It took like 10 minutes for Illidan to realize that they are being greedy and that's losing them the game, rest probably still thinks it's abathurs fault.   ""illidan are you blind"" made me laugh a bit, i had hoped he'd responded with yes, but one can only dream.  Trikslyr played that game really well and got his team a lot of xp, much more than he gave away by dying a bit.  Overall the enemy tried to react to his aggresive soaking but ended up just giving the game away by doing so. They could've probably got that boss and some kills if they went there instead of going abathur hunting when there was noone on the map except for him.  This does a fair job of showing how messed up the placement system currently is though. Considering that the highest players are 4k and you can get 3k just by having a bit of experience from LoL/Dota/etc. It'll easily make people overestimate themselves and act like that Anub did."

At the end his pushing was really nice, but the beginning deaths seemed unnecessary. I guess when I play Abathur I just don't play that aggresive. This guy http://www.twitch.tv/abathur1613 has over 1900 games as Abathur and was rank 1 and he isn't nearly as aggresive with his body. He often just plants himself behind a wall and uses symbiote. Sure you can body soak when it's safe like temples are up in Sky Temple or tribute in Cursed Hollow, but seems like he's pretty lucky that Zeratul wasn't hunting him and basically ignored his existance."

heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,Ember-Dragon,3,Tue Jul 21 02:16:39 2015 UTC,Which 98-99% of the community have you been playing with??
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,alexcasino,2,Tue Jul 21 16:38:41 2015 UTC,ehh im sure they all got emails from the blizzard support team shortly after reminding them of their behavior. (we can only hope).
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,Megsterr,2,Tue Jul 21 04:41:41 2015 UTC,"Anub'arak, Illidan and Jaina on Sky Temple is on of the best possible set-ups for Abathur."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,HireALLTheThings,2,Tue Jul 21 10:28:34 2015 UTC,"This is why Trikslyr is my favorite streamer. Such a positive person and great player overall. It's nice knowing someone like that is a community manager, and can be such a positive influence on other players (maybe not to those playing with him in this case, but to those watching his stream at least). He definitely keeps me motivated to stay positive when it's so tempting to fall into the toxicity."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,csiems,5,Tue Jul 21 14:42:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just me, but when I'm playing a damage-based character, I love having Abathur on my team. The buffs and the extra firepower are pretty much my favorite thing ever, and I find it throws off a lot of people who don't know how to deal with an Abathur-buffed target one-on-one."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,henrax,2,Tue Jul 21 16:15:09 2015 UTC,That's out of hand. They should have been flaming him for listening to Blues Traveler.
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,OrganzdChaos,7,Tue Jul 21 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"When your entire team is telling you that you're bringing the team down   It was only the Anub, and a tiny bit Jaina (she only said ""this guy never uses his shield"" after like 2 minutes). Illidan was actively against Anub and Malf did not say anything. Still nice to see but it was definitely not Abathur against his whole team ;)"
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,Tenant1,4,Mon Jul 20 23:47:22 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion coming in! I think Trikslyr played pretty poorly before 10, like really bad. But after that he definitely started to carry that game. only 1 of his deaths were legit in the early game.   Anub was the worst and extremely toxic. Illidan made some terrible calls but better than anub (like the 2 temple split was correct they won top lane 2v2 but lost 3v3 down below, it was still the right choice) and in general they had no idea how to engage! Fun stuff. I wish someone on their team actually made calls because it was quite hectic."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,Rignite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:54:03 2015 UTC,"No one's perfect; he explicitly mentioned that he wasn't playing well himself.  The difference was that he kept his focus and awareness on the game, and generally just played the game, whereas others would rather hop on the chat every time they saw something that didn't go their way (coughAnubcough). He really did put 110% of effort into that match; putting that much effort can make up any small mistakes you make along the way."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,OrganzdChaos,4,Tue Jul 21 02:02:35 2015 UTC,What did you want him to do? His team was losing their own even fights and he was laning against a 24/7 pushing Nazeebo.  Zeratul even came to help Nazeebo at one point. The same can not be said for his own team coming to help. He did what he could.   What more would you suggest he did during that time?
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,Rignite,2,Tue Jul 21 03:29:41 2015 UTC,"I think the call of him soloing bot was a huge mistake, he was too focused on laning the early game instead of having map presence. He also went too far in lane each time to try and passive soak which caused him 2 deaths very early. If he played smart he would have someone bot and then rotate when it is safe as the objective pops. It is extremely effective to have global presence on sky temple with both shrines and allow his team to actually win a scrim. That is just a little bit that could have helped a ton, i can go into it even further if you want. i would have to watch the replay again and tell you exactly what he did wrong (not hindsight either)."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,Sickpostbro,2,Tue Jul 21 03:40:29 2015 UTC,"While I agree his choice to solo was slightly faulty, it was only so BECAUSE his team couldn't hold their own weight.  Was it a folly for him to choose to do so under the notion that his teammates were competent? Absolutely not.   The man's mistake was less strategic and more with believing in teammates who didn't deserve such belief."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,briareus08,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:54:56 2015 UTC,-He could have soaked safely instead of dancing around the lane in early game. All this requires is to be in visual distance of the wave or hat.   -he should of helped more at early team fights.   It's important on temple  -he lost soak by dying. Putting his team behind.    -he made the call to solo bot. Not only was this a mistake but not is usually a specialist and that makes it worse  Those are just a few things.
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,smoke1441,3,Tue Jul 21 11:36:34 2015 UTC,"If you're playing aggressively with Aba, I feel like you're going to cop a few deaths. Maybe he could've toned it down a bit (especially going back to the same bush to die to WD over and over), but it's a fun playstyle.   I just tried it out and it really freaks the enemy team out. Had more than a few heroes tower dive to try and get me. I'm not that squishy Tyrael!"
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,Xidas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:58:07 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, he didn't play well early. Trik is a good player but by no means a pro. But as you said, the moral of the game is that he didn't let what went wrong in the early game and the accompanying toxicity get him down and he was able to pull out a victory."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,MastaLin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:45:22 2015 UTC,"That's not the best way to overcome toxicity. Mute exists for a reason. You shouldn't have to sit through ""fifteen minutes of abuse."""

heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,boooob4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:48:42 2015 UTC,"The best way to overcome it is to be actually good and friendly. It's easy to be useless as Abathur and that's where the prejudice comes from.  I played as Valla yesterday in a lane versus Kael'thas, Sonya and a roaming Zeratul. I won the lane hard mostly thanks to my Abathur. I'll never, ever discriminate against him again.  ""I love you, Abathur."" ""You're welcome"""
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,roflator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:06:00 2015 UTC,"When I play Aba, there's like a 30% chance that one of my team-mates goes ball-to-the-walls aggressive, and then complains when I can't save him when he dives three enemies alone at level 3. As if I didn't have a 10+ second cooldown on a shield that's just ~10% of your max HP. It's a bit of sustain, it's not an extra panic button."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,paintner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:05:07 2015 UTC,if feel like I never want to solo a lane as abathur. takes too much of your time and resources to do so

heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,paintner,2,Tue Jul 21 10:20:44 2015 UTC,"sure but also its just a waste of your time, since they will be heroes on your team who can farm waves as they circle through the map or just take the lane till 10. abathur has a hard time to clear a wave compared to a lot of heroes."
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,paintner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:01:47 2015 UTC,that is true.
heroesofthestorm,3dzxd2,LiquidOxygg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:50:48 2015 UTC,But I think his intention was that if he hold one lane the others get an advantage and can force push another and gain some advantage. Now his team seemed slightly behind in mental capacity and never took advantage on it.

I found a group of four looking for a fifth and I told them I main Abathur instead of them saying no they asked how can we work around you since we never played with an Abathur so there are some people who ask questions and want to learn how to play with an Abathur.

heroesofthestorm,3e0on2,summonerrin,395,Tue Jul 21 01:34:03 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you like about Nazeepo. If you want a specialist with ranged damage and an escape try Sylvamas. Volla is also good. On the other ""mages"" like Jina, Kel'Phas or even Asmoda have a lot of ranged damage, but no real escape. I guess you could also consider Fullstad who is a bit of a mage/""ADC"" hybrid and has really good mobility."
heroesofthestorm,3e0on2,ProxyDamage,149,Tue Jul 21 01:49:39 2015 UTC,Tossadoor has a wall ability if you like zoning like you did with nazeepo. He has escapes as well! Less frogs though.

Marky is another good specialist that is amazing at zoning yet is extremely annoying to fight against.   I have heard good stuff about Sgt. Hummer but she is extremely squishy ever since her health nerf...but she is incredible at destroying people if can find a good spot to park yourself.   If you are fighting a comp that has a lot of melee then I recommend you Gazblowe, his Gravo-bomb + charge bomb combo can absolutely wreck the enemy team, specially if you have a Joannha in your team.  Like someone else pointed out, Sylvannia is also an incredible pick for a specialist, she is an awesome range that can melt forts extremely fast, she also has a few ways to escape in case you need to retreat.  When it comes to supports my main go to guy is Utter for the fast heals and stuns, but can be a bit mana hungry at times."
heroesofthestorm,3e0on2,Teamsmoe,30,Tue Jul 21 02:19:44 2015 UTC,"Raygher is better heals. With level 16 talent, they just keep pumping. Broghtwang is a good healer still imo. 1/4/7 talents to buff z and you've got decent support and can hop around more. Lolita is decent enough, and can really irritate enemies. Good escape with trait. Mulforion I have trouble with due to the HoTs. Results may vary.  Raygher and Utter are melee supports though.  For tanks I find Eat Tea Sea is the best with double mosh Tyrone is really fun with bum rush. You basically have to be melee for all warriors.  Ranged assassins I'd say Volla, Jina or Kel'Phas."

heroesofthestorm,3e0on2,FruitBuyer,4,Tue Jul 21 12:42:52 2015 UTC,"Nazeebo is my highest winrate hero at the moment.  I really like him too.  Although you want a ranged character with an escape, I'm going to recommend Zagara, who basically has no escape until she gets Blink at level 20.  Zagara is a tricky hero I think, but not too much more tricky than Nazeebo.  Much like Nazeebo the majority of her damage is done by little minion type spells.  Her Q is channel which sends out 4 exploding minions in a straight line.  They explode when killed or when they collide with an enemy.  They don't really do enough damage to make their 1 direction and channel time worth it for the majority of your damage though, and are usually more used to take out towers.  It's like a higher damage version of frogs: but not as safe to cast.  Her W sends a minion which does a LOT of single target damage, but can be killed (unlike Nazeebo's spiders).  This one kind of ends up filling a similar role to spiders: being your main damage against heroes.  Her E drops 3 melee minions from the sky.  Wherever they hit does some damage too (like spiders).  They're not as strong as spiders, but they last longer.  What's really cool about them is that they earn you XP for their minion kills.  So you can somewhat get XP for a lane even after you leave it for as long as the minions survive.  Her D is to place creep tumours.  These generate vision, and also change the terrain around themselves so that Zagara and her minions can run faster on them.  It's the one saving grace of playing a hero with zero slows/stuns and zero escapes early game.  It's a 20% boost, so not insignificant.  Because of her minions she's quite good at pushing a lane (her W just outright beats whoever is in lane with her 1v1 early game), much like Nazeebo.  So that part will be quite similar to before.  She is also a big asset in a team fight when built properly, just like Nazeebo.  So I think in those two respects she will be a lot like your expectations.  If you want someone ranged with an escape who is a bit different to Nazeebo though, I think you should get Sylvanas.  She has great siege abilities, can clear creep waves instantly, and has a good escape that goes over walls."
heroesofthestorm,3e0on2,Ahardcorejedi,11,Tue Jul 21 07:29:41 2015 UTC,"Zagara. They both have similar play-styles, and by that I mean they are both pretty good all-rounders. They can push, take mercs and do lots of damage. Has no escape skill but the maw ult is a good defence and you can get blink at level 20. Plus the creep trait is great for vision.  Malfurion is a fun support to play and no too hard if you can learn to use his root ability correctly. Uther is the top support at the moment but he has a lot of actives, so a bit more difficult to master. Lili can do decent damage as support, she can be really annoying."

I know you want to branch out from using specialists but Glassbro is insanely good at pushing and taking merc camps (including the boss, solo!). ServeAnus is another great specialist with a trait that will shit all over her enemy's towers. Then there's Anew'Barack if you like the aspect of having your minions do the dirty work for you. The Butch is a really ugly lesbian demon from DeAblo universe that can bitch slap anyone to death. Her rival, ""Hoe"" Anna, can take that punishment and then some, but she barely tickles her enemies with her pathetic damage output. IllAgain just dropped his first LP in over 10,000 years.

Kinda like Stitches is shit if you don't land 99% of the hooks on KT/ Jaina."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t1q,SoulmaN__,7,Tue Jul 21 12:16:40 2015 UTC,"It's worth mentioning that ETC has another ""basically worse"" talent. I forget what it's called, but it's basically Relentless (The talent that reduces stuns and other cc) except that it's only active when the Guitar Solo heal is going, i.e. 50% of the time at best. It's only redeeming quality is that it works against polymorph, while Relentless doesn't? Seems like wonky ass design in general."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t1q,Whachah,7,Tue Jul 21 14:35:38 2015 UTC,"At least in that talent's case, you get the gimped version a tier earlier than Relentless.  In Prog Rock's case, the talent is worse than the generic in almost every way."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t1q,Chaos_Cornucopia,8,Tue Jul 21 15:37:52 2015 UTC,It's probably just an overcompensation for ETC being able to use his heal as an AOE with the extra talent. I agree it could us a buff though.
heroesofthestorm,3e1t1q,Kalulosu,5,Tue Jul 21 08:58:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah but then that talent is another talent tax, and I don't believe it scales off ETC's healing (i.e. it has its own scaling which is not affected by the Regen Globes)?"
heroesofthestorm,3e1t1q,SoooManyBanelings,5,Tue Jul 21 09:29:01 2015 UTC,"Guitar Hero (the one that heals you as you auto attack) doesn't work in tandem with Groupies, but Prog Rock actually does (this is pretty easy to test this in try mode).  So, a level 20 ETC with 28 globes (reasonable on some maps?) will heal 800 HP over 4 seconds in a small AoE, on an 8-second cooldown.  That's not nothing.  For comparison, a level 20 Rehgar with the Healing Surge talent heals his primary target for 812 and secondary targets for 325 on a 9 second cooldown (6 seconds with Tidal Waves).  Rehgar is still the better healer, obviously, but ETC can keep up pretty well for a Warrior.  I think one small, easy buff for these two talents would be to give Groupies a visible aura when he's using Guitar Solo - not unlike Chen's shield aura when he takes Enough to Share.  The AoE is so small and it's sometimes hard to convince people that it's worth taking a couple seconds to linger around you, especially when they aren't even sure where to stand."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t1q,Kalulosu,2,Tue Jul 21 12:16:35 2015 UTC,"OK, if it buffs Groupies, then indeed it warrants Prog Rock not being too good.  But maybe Prog Rock could give a bigger bonus to the self heal, and a lower one to the outgoing heal?"
heroesofthestorm,3e1t1q,SoooManyBanelings,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:19:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that seems like a natural solution.  Buff Prog Rock a little per globe, and instead of giving Groupies its own formula for healing allies, it should just heal for a reduced percentage of what Guitar Solo heals.  Maybe 75%, or 50% but in a larger area (ideally with a range indicator), or something to that effect.    I would rather have lower heals that are easier to apply to allies than a weirdly large chunk of heals that encourages me to facehug and bodyblock my teammates in the middle of a fight. :P  Part of what holds Prog Rock back, at least for me, is that ETC isn't very good at waveclear.  Unless you're laning/rotating with someone, getting globes is kind of a pain.  If for some reason they change something else that helps his waveclear (like moving Echo Pedal a little earlier in his tree again?) then that might buff Prog Rock by association."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t1q,Jabari11,2,Tue Jul 21 12:54:17 2015 UTC,"They should honestly just revert Groupies back to its old functionality.  It used to just stick a HoT on everything in Rockstar range when cast instead of this new pulsing nonsense.  It was good back then, but hardly OP, and that was even with Guitar Instrumental applying to all of the shared HoTs if that was taken at 16."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t1q,omgitsjavi,4,Tue Jul 21 17:18:58 2015 UTC,"I agree, adding an aoe mark would make it ridiculously easier to coordinate, and that much more effective. As it stands, every time I take Groupies I have to take a minute to explain that I have it and how it works."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t1q,sibtiger,4,Tue Jul 21 17:08:51 2015 UTC,"I'm almost positive PR does not affect Groupies. I remember thinking it did one game and kept an eye on the healing it did to my allies with both talents (on BHB so I was getting lots of globes) and then checked in another game where I didn't get PR and I'm pretty sure the numbers were the same. Which makes sense based on the talent description, Groupies doesn't give the HoT to allies, it makes you send out healing pulses, like a reverse Echo Pedal. There's no HoT to increase."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t1q,Jabari11,3,Tue Jul 21 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"The Groupies ""tick"" IS affected by Prog Rock, yes.  Unfortunately, the way Groupies works is so awful now that it doesn't really matter much."

heroesofthestorm,3e1t1q,Kalulosu,2,Tue Jul 21 10:35:12 2015 UTC,"Now I just checked the talents and it's a bit ambiguous if the regen globes talent affects it or not: Groupies says ""Guitar Solo also heals nearby allies by X per second"", and Prog Rock says ""Globes increase the healing per second of Guitar Solo"".  So it may affect that healing...I may try this out sometime in a custom game."
heroesofthestorm,3e1t1q,Robo_Popo,2,Tue Jul 21 11:47:04 2015 UTC,Prog Rock DOES effect Groupies and it makes it extremely powerful as a pseudo support. Being able to heal assassins for large chunks of their hp in the middle of a team fight is amazing. Esp considering that Prog Rock is designed to be sustain for a tank.
heroesofthestorm,3e1t1q,Kalulosu,2,Tue Jul 21 12:32:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't know, and it definitely makes Prog Rock and Groupies MUCH more interesting! Gonna try it out next time I play ETC. Although that'd mean losing out on Showstopper which is also great :/"

heroesofthestorm,3e2be3,silverhydra,4,Tue Jul 21 16:19:29 2015 UTC,"That's why I mentioned that honors only count when given by people you didn't queue with.  If that's not enough, they could easily cap it so that you can only receive one honor from each unique player per day."
heroesofthestorm,3e2be3,drysart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:21:35 2015 UTC,so that you can only receive one honor from each unique player per day.   This guy right here; that actually makes the idea very plausible with rewards.

It removes the incentive to play with friends or try new heroes/builds. And what is gained? Essentially nothing. A marker that says you have 17 honor or 23 or 250.   What's the difference? Did he just play more games than others? is he a streamer who gets voted by everyone for popularities sake?  Should I strive to have an above average honor? If so, why would I honor anyone at all, just increases my competition, I will look better in the mass if I never honor anyone and have others honor me.  The presented system has major flaws, unless you have an idea to fix them it is not just useless, it's a waste of everyones time."

I feel no need to be rewarded / recognized for being friendly.  Your reward for not being and idiot is not getting banned and can keep playing the game.
heroesofthestorm,3e2be3,DuckAndCower,-5,Tue Jul 21 14:37:50 2015 UTC,Rewarding positive behavior is how you train anything. It works on adult humans just as well as anything else.

But I was talking about regular all-pick mode in ranked play, where every team takes turns picking 1 hero (although there are no bans in all-pick). You can just swap your hero with your teammates (often used when people random to get bonus gold, but they get a hero they're not comfortable with)"

I'm more adaptative and I'm bad with top ranged DPS (well, I don't even own them TBH), so I don't like to be first pick.  But on the other hand, it's fun to be first pick sometimes, just for a change. And I think there are other way more important things to do to clarify drafting.  Anyway, just a tip : group with people and let others be party leader. This way you'll never be first pick in your premade."
heroesofthestorm,3e2iko,Maksos_NL,3,Tue Jul 21 13:52:28 2015 UTC,"The draft system is bad. You dont have time to discuss something with your team. Only a few people chat in the draft chat. And if im last pick, i always need to tank/heal otherwise we only have assasins/specialist in our team. Most people are just selfish, and they quick pick whatever they like instead of thinking about an decent composition...  sorry for my language btw."

IDK. im just sick of being first, having to ask everyone whos tanking and healing, only to get no responses and give birth to the most disfigured comp known to HotS."
heroesofthestorm,3e2iko,orcusgg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:13 2015 UTC,"This is frustrating, and I usually end up FPing Jaina as a result (although i do have a >60% WR with her so there is that) but whats worse imo, is when you're LP and the 4th and 5th go at the same time after 3 straigh dmg dealer picks. i always get apprehensive and offer to heal if they don't want too. I used to get responses when I was rank 19 and things went simmingly. being down to 31 now (after losing 7 ranks to HL bugs and the rest to a mixture of connection issues and wonky/dysfunctional teams, and ofcourse a sprinkle of my own poor gameplay) I get silent teams who wait until their is 5 seconds or less on timer to pick :( leaving me no time to get a synergistic pick. It can be very frustrating.  I really think the ability to hero swap just before going into game (say another 30 seconds) would make the draft process a lot more smooth."
heroesofthestorm,3e2iko,AbsolutBalderdash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:19 2015 UTC,"This is one of my biggest complains about low ranks. I've been stuck between 30-35 and people still just play what they want every single game, with no regard for team comp or counters. Usually I end up on a team with 4 assassins (or 3 assassin + 1 spec) then I have to choose between a tank or a healer for our team, which sucks because we're obviously at a comp disadvantage but also I'm not the best at tanking."
heroesofthestorm,3e2iko,orcusgg,2,Tue Jul 21 15:13:17 2015 UTC,"imo the healer is a bigger asset than the tank. Its easier t win without a tank than it is without a healer.

heroesofthestorm,3e2iko,HomicidalPhilosopher,2,Tue Jul 21 15:29:12 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I am talking about. I get first pick and show kael and ask what other people are going to do. Then no one answers and I wonder if I should just take malf or mura and risk the other team getting Jains and kael. I've had too many kael nova ilidan raynor comps to continue to deal with this. If I could always get a low pick I could somewhat balance the team. I also have fun playing any role so if someone always wants to play a dps they can set a high pick preference.
heroesofthestorm,3e2iko,twatpire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:42 2015 UTC,"I like the idea. Generally I only want first pick if I know I'm going to be picking a tank/healer since I sorta feel ""guilty"" if I first pick Zeratul or something then our team ends up without a healer because of.... those people..."
heroesofthestorm,3e2iko,clab2021,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:09:55 2015 UTC,"I thought that too but honestly you cant. The current MM system kinda forces you to be selfish and the last few picks to be ""flex"" on whatever is not chosen. In all the other games you can switch or pick for other people.  I straight up first pick whatever hero that is top priority and that I'm also good at (usually Jaina or Kael) and hope the rest of the team picks accordingly, and 90% of the time they do.  When I'm last or second to last pick? I pick whatever the team needs. No questions asked. I sometimes let them know I'd prefer to be a healer since I have like a 45% win rate as a tank, but if not I suck it up and try my best.  I have a 60% win rate with Nova. But I would NEVER first pick her. She has too many counters. I have to be third to last pick with an already decent team comp to consider her. And the other team has to have at least 2-3 high priority squishes.  I know there is a lot of hate for nova but you gotta do what you think is best and not feel guilty about it. If you want to FP a tank or whatever it is you want to play (as long as it doesn't hurt your team) then go for it. Johanna is an awesome tank and honestly I think she's a better first pick than anyone right now, second being Jaina."

Yesterday our last pick accepted to heal but then the enemy team choose his malfurion and he had no second healer....  This could be actually a good idea but I've never seen it on any moba, didn't play strife.  Still I think that 90% of the players want to be first pick at low level."

heroesofthestorm,3e2iko,zAmplifyyy,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:07:17 2015 UTC,This is not a solution it's a crap workaround. Sometimes I want to solo q hl and have a good team comp. if I am grouping I know my party will make good picks so your suggestion doesn't even solve the problem.  I don't not like first picking I have like a 65% win rate as kael but I'd rather have a good comp. playing kael with no frontline then getting flamed by ilidan for hero damage before level 16 isn't a good time.
heroesofthestorm,3e2iko,analytic-1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:52:46 2015 UTC,"Then don't rely on others to get you wins. Simply put.   Im not sure how the Draft order is picked, weather it be MMR based or Random, but don't cry about first picking kael and getting countered. Its part of the game.   I never go into a match expecting it to turn out the way I want it to be. EVER. Communication is key, so use it and if your team is going to sit there and not communicate then pick someone who you are confident enough with to be able to carry.   Picking draft order is a crap work around for miscommunication."

heroesofthestorm,3e2m1n,chairmanthemeow,0,Tue Jul 21 15:05:50 2015 UTC,"I assume it works just like a normal rez, so he would come back with full mana."
heroesofthestorm,3e2m1n,Srirachafarian,0,Tue Jul 21 15:10:53 2015 UTC,"I actually never thought to ask this question. It'll most likely reset to 100%, though. Since he ""died"" and waited out a rez timer."
heroesofthestorm,3e2m1n,monning,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:41 2015 UTC,Well if you look on heroesnexus he has a trait upgrade at level 4 that gives him health and mana when a nearby minion dies which persist while undying. His abilities in ghost form also don't cost any mana. I think he will come back with whatever mana he as when he revives and it's an interesting balance factor in my opinion.
heroesofthestorm,3e2m1n,HauntedKhan,0,Tue Jul 21 15:46:37 2015 UTC,"I am really confused how that will work for Leoric himself. If he comes back with the same, or almost no mana that would really suck because popping back up in the middle of battle would be pointless if you can't really fight back.

heroesofthestorm,3e2m1n,NightRaynes,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:05:33 2015 UTC,That was for the bundle.  I think most heroes on release are $10.

heroesofthestorm,3e2m1n,fallenpibbz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:44 2015 UTC,Thanks!  Any Idea on what Skin/Hero Bundles cost?
heroesofthestorm,3e2m1n,NightRaynes,-5,Tue Jul 21 16:10:53 2015 UTC,I'm assuming my prices are in USD but it's usually $15 + tax then currency conversion. Depends on if it's a rare or epic skin and they're all epic for new heroes I believe and you get 25% off both of $10 and $10 so it comes to $15.
heroesofthestorm,3e2m1n,FelixCopy,3,Tue Jul 21 18:56:32 2015 UTC,"Not off the top of my head, I know I've seen them for around $12-14 for a hero and a skin (I think Sylvanas was towards the higher end?) but I never purchased any of them, so I don't recall.

heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,qrchl,20,Tue Jul 21 09:04:13 2015 UTC,"My guess that it will come with season 1(god knows when).  Also I feel the need to add a requirement to play at least 100(or x number) of QM before u can play HL. The current state is just play AI to 30, buy 10 heroes and u can play HL."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Eriennyl,6,Tue Jul 21 09:06:58 2015 UTC,Would something like minimum 10 QM with hero before you can use it in HL?   That would help with people being clueless with heroes they play and it would also make it so you would need 10 QM for HL.
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Timerror,3,Tue Jul 21 10:39:46 2015 UTC,"Would be easier to tie it to hero levels, they're already shown to the user while drafting hero league."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Draig_Goch,4,Tue Jul 21 13:15:42 2015 UTC,well the problem with that is that they can go versus AI and that doesn't really teach alot against real players
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Timerror,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:20:52 2015 UTC,"That statement is not completely correct. Of course that playing against real players will teach you more but that really depends on your team comp as well. What's the point of playing Kael in QM if your team does not have a tank for example,you will get so punched in the face that you will not learn a lot about the hero simplçy because you will always die in teamfights and not to do enough sustain DPS since that's what Kael is all about."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,gonafo,3,Tue Jul 21 14:21:53 2015 UTC,You really don't need any teamwork in AI you can just do your own thing and usually get carried and having a new player jumping from that to ranked is just hurtfull for his team and really doesn't work well
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Timerror,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:54 2015 UTC,"I understand your point of view and I think the thought is correct for new players but I personally haven't been playing QM without premades,whenever I wanna practice a hero I haven't  been playing for a while I go AI and usually after one or 2 games I feel pretty comfortable in HL,ofc that I read a lot of theorycraft and try to understand the hero as a whole,therefore I don't really think that QM is the best environment for people to play some heroes."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,gonafo,3,Tue Jul 21 16:27:00 2015 UTC,"Generally I try to learn a new hero's kit vs AI but you can easily see how horrible it is to learn vs AI.  I mean if you do blackheart after the first chest spawn the AI never attempts to get gold and only turns in if they kill you and have the gold to do so.  There's been a bunch of dragonshires where I get both shrines on my own then go to DK without being contested whatsoever.    For a game that's centered around objectives and teamfights, they haven't programed their AI to be good at either.    To sum it up, Robo Gaz is probably #1 hero vs AI, hf getting yelled at when you do that in QM or HL."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,insanemetal187,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:04 2015 UTC,"What exactly is your point? Even lopsided or 'bad meta' games against real people is far more valuable than playing against 'good meta' AI teams.  People need to be playing more QM before they queue up for HL, there are far too many people who are still having trouble with basic concepts."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,thestrychnine,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:50:17 2015 UTC,"Would just need both requirements, a QM games played requirement and a hero needs to a certain minimum level like 3 - 5 or have his full talents before he's counted in HL."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,shareddit,2,Tue Jul 21 14:37:57 2015 UTC,Well playing something like 10 games on each hero will get it to like level 5 atleast :P
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Timerror,2,Tue Jul 21 14:44:43 2015 UTC,"oh, well I meant a general amount of QM's; I don't think it should be QM's per hero. The point of the QM requirement would be to understand the basics of being a team player, learning the maps, etc. The point of the hero level requirement would be so that you understand the hero, so you're not just jumping in HL with a new hero you never played yet."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,shareddit,2,Tue Jul 21 15:30:58 2015 UTC,"I like this idea. You will still need to play 100 QMs (10 with each of the 10 heroes) which should also guarantee that you have played enough of each map to know the objectives, camps, etc.  And before someone asks me ""why would you need to play 10 games with each hero"": I think it should be a prerequisite because if you only play 10 QMs with only 1 hero, that hero might get picked by someone, for example."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Nukakos,3,Tue Jul 21 14:08:36 2015 UTC,"exactly, currently new players usually have 2-3 heroes they play and 7 they don't play when they hop into HL and that is kinda problematic :I"
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Timerror,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:11:00 2015 UTC,well i got to rank 1 by only playing 3 heroes so idk what the problem is. making me grind 100 games of qm would just be annoying
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,hellokittyusopretty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:13 2015 UTC,"I would say lvl 7-9 tbh.  I took most of the heroes to 5 for the gold but many I barely know the setup and how to pick talents.  The heroes I took to 9 I know what talents to pick in certain situations, rather than trying to find a one fits all off heroesfire."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,insanemetal187,0,Tue Jul 21 15:33:42 2015 UTC,"Do u mean 10 QMs per hero they owned? That would be quite alot, and whenever u buy a new hero u have to play another 10 QMs?"
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Eriennyl,2,Tue Jul 21 11:16:06 2015 UTC,why would 10 games min req to play that hero in HL be too much?  Its a good thing for everyone to make sure players are not playing heroes they arent 120% comfortable with
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,NukerX,2,Tue Jul 21 13:16:44 2015 UTC,well atleast 5 or something but it would be good that people have played against other players with all the heroes they wanna use in HL so they wont ruin the ranks of others with themselves being firstimer with specific hero.    Also before you get to HL you have played easily 10 games with every hero you own if you buy with gold.
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Timerror,2,Tue Jul 21 11:20:08 2015 UTC,"I like the idea, but an improvement of it would be something like not being able to select that hero u have no QM experience with in HL until u completed x number of QM games with him/her."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Eriennyl,3,Tue Jul 21 11:27:46 2015 UTC,Thats exactly what I was going for ^
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Timerror,0,Tue Jul 21 11:29:38 2015 UTC,10 wins in QM. I see a lot if player going in HL with char that only have 2-3 wins which means they have no idea how to win a match with those heroes.
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Ephydias,4,Tue Jul 21 13:14:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's extremely unlikely for someone to only play AI to 30, then buy 10 heroes and go straight to HL."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,tiger_ace,2,Tue Jul 21 14:36:55 2015 UTC,"It is very likely, there has been a known loophole for leveling account/hero and gaining gold that involves very little effort. I've mentioned it to /u/Kalulosu few hours ago."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Eriennyl,4,Tue Jul 21 14:50:19 2015 UTC,"I think you're conflating two different issues here and repeatedly mentioning the existence of a loophole doesn't support any argument for players directly going from AI to HL.   Account leveling / gaining gold through a loophole (regardless of whether or not it exists) gets you heroes, it doesn't teach you how to play the game. AI games also don't teach you how to play the game.   So if you're jumping in directly into HL without even playing QM you're probably not going to do very well, even if you own every single hero (which doesn't matter since only like half the heroes are picked anyway).  The other case would be people selling accounts to other people who don't want to build up an account. This is probably extremely rare right now."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,tiger_ace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:24 2015 UTC,"Right, but the point is the rest of us suffer when this person ""doesn't do very well"" because they have so little actual PvP experience. His example may not be super common, but the point is for all the early complaining, progression is actually pretty easy in terms of gating before HL - it probably should be a bit harder."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,thestrychnine,3,Tue Jul 21 16:55:25 2015 UTC,That's what the ranking and match making system is for. You don't need to care if there are people who are literally brain dead playing HL. You will not play with or against them unless you're also braindead or there is a braindead person on each time balancing out the team's mmr.  You literally shouldn't care. Matchmaking will already solve the problem you are talking about.
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,_wutdafuc,3,Tue Jul 21 18:14:57 2015 UTC,"QM has improved because the player base is getting bigger. Once people have enough heroes to enter hero league, the match making will improve as well.  I have recently seen an influx of people I want to play hero league with. They just can't because they don't have enough heroes."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Fallout-82,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:19:47 2015 UTC,"MY experience is:  1) I got better, in terms of player skill, when they announced the new rule that considers the numbers of matches played. But that really messed up team comps.  2) A couple of days ago I've noticed team comps getting better. Not perfect, just better."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,rissato,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:48 2015 UTC,"Too bad sometimes team comp matching is just a bs. Just played a match on Garden of Terror in a team consisting of Muradin,Diablo,Arthas,Lili and Nazeebo vs Kerrigan, Jaina, Sgt Hammer, Uther and Anub,  I don't know about you guys but I may be not that experienced in this game, but I didn't see this game as winable, constant Terrors wrecking our base... not to mention the teamfights, utter disaster. If we were playing together with voice chat,not a bunch of randoms maybe it would be easier to coordinate and win this game."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,TheCakeIsSpy,2,Tue Jul 21 13:08:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 3 tank comps require a lot of coordination.  Take a look at the MVP.Black vs VP Game 1.  MVP Black rolled with a lot of cc.  With that set up, it should have been an early game roam squad looking to body block for days and cc out of the other team, focusing on Kerrigan/Hammer. Would be hard to pull off in solo q as this team comp needs coordinated cc/movement to be effective."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,eur3ka676,3,Tue Jul 21 15:54:52 2015 UTC,I have seen 0 improvement in QM. It's just as bad as it always has been - Barely worth playing.
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Hyrixoizin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:22:31 2015 UTC,"I haven't played for a month or two due to real life stuff, but I came back this weekend (left right after Tomb of the Spider Queen released). It's nuts how bad QM seems now compared to when I left. I actually have started playing Heroes League because at least there is some semblance of team building / structure. Although that is obviously painful at times as well."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,EasterlyFan,3,Tue Jul 21 11:43:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, same here. Hero league is currently less stressful then QM. QM just makes me depressed."

heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,searingsky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:32:21 2015 UTC,With a proper ranking system number of games played entering HL wouldn't matter at all.  If those bad players get stuck at rank 49/50 and are all playing with new players there is nothing wrong with it.  The fact those players are being stuck in games with rank 10 players is what is causing the real issue.

heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Fairyonfire,0,Tue Jul 21 17:49:31 2015 UTC,"It's possible. I have made silly errors in games yesterday (mostly because of being frustrated.. i play much better usually). But prior to that I was playing very well and actually had a very high winrate over this weekend.  To give you perspective tho, in many of my games yesterday, I've seen people dive in 1v3+ repeatedly, people who would choose to be away laning for the entirety of the game despite pinging, players going AFK intentionally, etc. If I really sucked I wouldve always been a drag on my teammates and lost us games (it only takes 1 person to lose a game really). I'm not great but I'm not terrible either (2K MMR), so its not necessarily that."

heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,NewLifeRising,3,Tue Jul 21 17:06:17 2015 UTC,"My HL games are better than the QM.  I'm not good (been stuck at levels 28-30) so maybe I'm the dead weight on each team, but my games are always evenly matched, fairly intense, often involve a comeback (either for or against my team), and have at least 1 warrior and 1 support.    What exactly is the problem with HL? You're complaining without really specifying any solutions or even a clearly identified problem for that matter....  I don't always check but when I do I'm always matched with players near my HL rank and usually everyone on my teams has about the same HL rank, which should be the case. Are you proposing that a ""veteran"" player with 300 games and rank 50 HL, should not be matched with a novice player with <100 games and rank 50 HL?"
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,teh-dude-abides,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:18 2015 UTC,"Changed? Yes, but hardly improved.  Just now got a shitty team of 2 supports, and some specialists, no damage, vs team of malfurion + tank + 2 assasins ...."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,applestein123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:05:27 2015 UTC,"The whole point of quick match is that you can play who you want when you want. For that to work (without a gigantic player base), you basically have to ignore team comps. You can't let everyone independently choose who they want to play while also sorting them into viable team comps in a reasonable amount of time."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,aengvs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:02:04 2015 UTC,"Well it tries to match up the teams in any case, so I rarely see it go bad. Usually if you have 2 supports the other team will also have 2 supports.   In addition, it seems it tries to mirror-match as frequently as possible. I regularly see 3-4 players on either side have the same characters."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,Carighan,0,Tue Jul 21 12:05:45 2015 UTC,"As far as I know all the match maker worries about is whether or not the teams it's matching have supports or not. It doesn't take anything else about the heroes or their roles into account.  Mirror matches are common because certain heroes are popular (Nova and kt), cheap (malf or valla) or on free rotatation."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,aengvs,0,Tue Jul 21 12:10:57 2015 UTC,"For roles other than support, the only rules in place are to limit the number you can have.  For example you should never get more than 3 warriors. (the 3 might be wrong. I'll have to check.)"
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,TXKSSnapper,-4,Tue Jul 21 16:02:45 2015 UTC,"the thing is, when you play rarer heroes like Kerrigan (not on free week), it somehow manages to match you against another Kerrigan a majority of the time.  That atleast, has been my experience."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,bacon59,7,Tue Jul 21 16:12:01 2015 UTC,"Matchmaking is WAY worse now imo. Still getting matched with players with way less/more games, and team comps are no longer even. Had a dual support, dual specialist and assassin vs dual tank dual assassin and a support game last night."
heroesofthestorm,3e1vvs,cookswagchef,-8,Tue Jul 21 13:42:50 2015 UTC,"I think that would be a nice start, but HL is still riddled with problems. If they added swap (or even let us choose our pick order) it would be a great start; a ban or two would be fantastic as well.  The last one is possibly controversial, but the free rotation should be in HL, in my opinion. It's hard to sell people on HL when it dramatically narrows their pick options, between losing seven heroes and the narrower viable options in a team."
heroesofthestorm,3e334n,Young_geezy,25,Tue Jul 21 16:12:25 2015 UTC,"When they other team is starting to get a lead, there is two things you need to do as a team to comeback from it:     Don't Die This is the worst thing you can do when losing a match. The only time I can think it's an exception is when they are ahead 3/4 levels and you are trading kills with them. They will get barely any XP for killing one of your team while your team will get possibly a whole level from that trade. Outside of that, don't die. It will keep your team at a disadvantage for when you need to contest objectives or bosses. This includes letting objectives go if need be, just don't die.   Capitalizing on Their Mistakes Generally when the winning team starts to dominate the map (or even when they get a little one level lead), they will tend to get over-confident and cocky which leads to make aggressive plays and decisions that normally wouldn't be made. Usually it's in the form of stealing your camps or overextending to get forts/keeps. It's your team's job to punish them for these mistakes with extreme prejudice. One or two overextension kills will drastically tilt the favor to your team by setting them back a person or three which leads to easy map domination and a good come back.     There is one other secret tactic that makes frequent come backs possible but it is something that is learned in time once you get more experience. The secret? ... DO NOT GIVE UP! :) Don't let the level lead, base condition or anything else for that matter hit your team's morale. If one of you has given up the match, then there is almost nothing you can do to recover from it unless the rest of your team can convince that player other wise. The team is only as strong as it's weakest link, and if any player gives up thinking the match is lost, then the match is usually lost at that point."
heroesofthestorm,3e334n,ArchRanger,4,Tue Jul 21 16:48:38 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people say ""don't die"" as advice. That's like saying ""my best advice to new players is don't lose and win instead"".  My biggest issue with HotS is that when the enemy team starts to get 2-3 levels ahead it becomes next to impossible to recover from the sheer XP defecit alone. So when the enemy team is taking the map objective at level 12 and you're at 9 there is basically no way to contest it and win the fight.   So not only do they secure the map obective (ensuring they take a further lead) but they get to roam and fight at any time, and even overextend like you said without being threatened due to the HP, Mana, damage and talent boost they get."
heroesofthestorm,3e334n,Manyvanta,3,Tue Jul 21 18:13:23 2015 UTC,"What he means when he says don't die is to not take unnecessary risks.  Don't chase heroes about to die if you are not sure you can get the kill.  Don't push too far alone.  Don't get caught out of position and be aware of where the enemy team is.  In order to come back you need patience and you need to choose your fights wisely when they over extend.  It just takes 1 good team fight to come back from a 3 level deficit.  I can't count the number of times where my team is saying gg early and then we end up winning.  Comebacks are very likely in hots, where as in dota you can usually tell who will win based on the team comps and farm."
heroesofthestorm,3e334n,BOkuma,3,Tue Jul 21 18:38:23 2015 UTC,"Well the example you gave (9 vs 12) is a bit extreme. You wouldn't win even if they were only 1 level above you for a simple reason. At 10 you get your ult and a team with ults vs a team without is almost always going to be one sided (the team ahead would have to play very badly).  Being behind in levels isn't that big of a deal. Its a much bigger deal to be behind in Talents. The nice thing about HotS though is that it is incredibly easy to catch up level wise because of the way XP works.  If you are behind 2-3 levels you will get over double the xp per kill than the other team will. The advice ""don't die"" is actually better for the team that is ahead. If you are the team that is behind, trading kills 1 to 1 is going to work out in your favor as you get way more xp than the other team does.  Aside from punishing over extended enemy heros when down levels, on thing you can do is try to at least get on the same talent tier as the enemy team, and then group and fight them. Try to get some kills. Even if it winds up being an even trade or they get 1 maybe even 2 more of you (assuming you get at least 1 of them) then xp wise you came out ahead, and you also have a shorter respawn time because you are the lower level.  Now once you start getting 2 talent tiers behind that's when it starts becoming more on the enemy team to make a mistake to get you back in the game."
heroesofthestorm,3e334n,clab2021,3,Tue Jul 21 18:50:23 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue with HotS is that when the enemy team starts to get 2-3 levels ahead it becomes next to impossible to recover from the sheer XP defecit alone.    That is not correct. Hots has an ""underdog bonus"" which depends on the level difference. When they are 16-12 they will get very little xp while you will get tons for just looking at towers in anger.   but they get to roam and fight at any time, and even overextend like you said without being threatened due to the HP, Mana, damage and talent boost they get.   That is actually the great equalizer - plenty of people get careless after an easy start and stop being vigilant. Two players catching you somewhere can still easily kill you,even with level disparity."
heroesofthestorm,3e334n,Sithrak,10,Tue Jul 21 18:55:14 2015 UTC,"Laning (soaking) and understanding what your characters role is, quickly followed by the other teams comp and knowing how those characters are played.  If you're behind on most maps (I'd say rarely on haunted mines though) you can come back quite easily by staying in lanes and soaking. Most times the enemy team will always get a little too cocky especially if they hit 10 first. (Very important to soak if they are 10 until you reach 10)  Maps with objectives like cursed hollow/dragon shire/sky temple if you're behind you may just want to let the objective go and soak. I've seen SOOO many times where people dive in because they believe if they dont get the objective its a lost cause. Just to die and give the team even MORE XP.   Good players will pick their skills to combat the other teams players. Their team have an illidan/sonya? Make sure you take some added stuns (same can go for other high DPS characters) So on and so forth.  Split pushing is huge especially if you have a hero that specializes in lane pushing Zags/murky/Azmodan/zeebo let them push it's best for your team until about lvl 13 or so."
heroesofthestorm,3e334n,notadweeb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:16 2015 UTC,So many people over look how important lane soaking is after level 10 basically. If you watch the pro's they always try to duck into lane between fights and objectives to clear waves and soak as much as possible the entire game. Not just early laning phases.
heroesofthestorm,3e334n,incendiarysupository,2,Tue Jul 21 18:03:36 2015 UTC,Yes and skills that allow you to kill waves faster are often overlooked but by 12-14 even with Johanna you can clear a way with basically one use of your W. She can be the highest xp contributor almost every game if there isn't a specialty hero on your team.
heroesofthestorm,3e334n,notadweeb,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:15 2015 UTC,"The enemy team will more than likely at some point make a mistake.  The biggest one I see is overstaying.  Let's use Cursed Hollow as an example.  The enemy team just wiped you guys at a tribute and got the curse.. when the curse is nearing its end the enemy team is likely to be lower on HP and mana from pushing than your team is.. it is a great opportunity to try to catch stragglers out that are overstaying and late to retreat.  You can even catch the entire team this way, as they blow cooldowns to try to save those teammates.  Remember, when you're behind you get an XP bonus, so even trades in kills come out in your favor.  Wait to fight until you're on the same talent tier.  Unless they have such a lead that they are always a tier up on you, you want to try to always be on the same tier before fighting.  I.e. if they are 15.. wait until you are at least 13 to fight.  Always contest boss if you have numbers.  Boss throws are real and common."
heroesofthestorm,3e334n,vizyn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:10 2015 UTC,"basically outside of the very early game, staying together, not over extending and fight only when it benefits you.   If you have a level or 2 deficit(specially if one is a talent gaining level) do not engage. and retreat form their engagements.  Often your team can win by doing the wrong thing together more often then doing the right thing split up on the map.  Obviously certain maps do not always allow you to be grouped but you should be whenever possible.  Knowing when do go for mercs... some people way over value them or mis use them entirely.  For example if you know the objective is popping in 30 seconds.  Down a merc camp or two prior to the objective is a strong decision.  This can allow you to have your team all group and fight for map objectives while the lane is pushing down enemy forts.  They have to decide is the objective or the fort more important at that moment.  Downing merc camps too early is easily defended.  Remember, Merc camps do not give you an XP lead... the enemy gets XP for when they kill them also.  Proper use of the merc camps is a huge plus...they are often downed just to be downed.  Im not going to get into each map but knowing what the objective of the map is, position of the objective and the times of the objective is critical info to know and learn.  Planning ahead is huge and being in position before the objective comes is a huge advantage.  Have your team down a merc camp 30 seconds prior to the objective back get full health and mana and be in position waiting so when they come trickling in 1-5 seconds late you kill them 1 by 1."
heroesofthestorm,3e334n,scottlohm,0,Tue Jul 21 16:24:24 2015 UTC,"In a lot of maps you can death ball a merc camp that the enemy might have only sent two or three heroes to. This is your best chance to kill those two, get the bonus catch up xp, and a merc camp to add some map pressure.   Really catching out the other team while they are split up, in my opinion, is the best way to come back."

heroesofthestorm,3e02i7,Caseycrowe,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:33 2015 UTC,"I mean I'm no expert player but its pretty straightforward.  At the start of the game you want at least 1 player in each lane, if you are a healer you should be paired with a damage dealer or tank.  IMO the most important goal is reaching level 10 before the enemy team, if you can do that it gives you a HUGE advantage for a time where you can dominate them in teamfights.  Objectives are very important but when they appear don't just rush into them, you need to attack and hold them as a team (obviously this depends on the map, somewhere like Blackheart's Bay I think its better to keep the enemy occupied while 1 or 2 team members grab the gold as fast as possible.  I honestly haven't played this game enough to give you any kind of in depth strategy or metagame stuff, I'm just talking about like basic MOBA 101 shit.  At least every other game I play it seems my whole team just runs straight at the enemy team in a bunch from minute one and just keeps teamfighting, dying, and running right back in, its insanely frustrating."

Sure, you can be the only person alive to complain about how terrible things went, but then what's the point? I've seen some terrible engages before, but don't forget that the other team can make mistakes too. Things could turn in your favour. Who knows? Do you want a 100% chance of failing in a team fight when you leave (and having the other team snowball off of that), or do you want even a minute chance of succeeding in it? Personally, I roll with the team every time. You win or lose as a team, so you might as well play as a team even if circumstances aren't ideal."

I've had a couple games just go all kinds of shit wrong and constantly feeding a +5 level enemy team doesn't achieve anything....I generally go push a lane or do merc camps. These things do help because pushing lanes generates XP which can sometimes help even the gap where getting instantly squashed in a team fight absolutely will not.  Overall it depends a lot on what the intentions of the person are. If they're doing something productive then your premise is skewed, you just think they're bad because they're not doing what you feel they should be doing. And what you think the team should be doing may not actually be beneficial to the state of the game depending on the match status."

There are games where your team will do nothing for a while, i even had games where i had kick warnings because of not getting xp just because we couldnt go out of base with 2 dead people and our lanes were all pushed.  Also, since i recently got flamed for that, consider when staying in base is okay. When a boss is running into your base with only a core standing in a 25 minute game, someone in your team is dead and the enemies are a talent ahead, you shouldn't flame and report that guy who waits that minute out."

heroesofthestorm,3e2kse,Bobaghanoush,9,Tue Jul 21 13:52:02 2015 UTC,"I will never get how people find Muradin fun. I find him so straight forward and bland. Hay maker can be fun but as a tank the other ult is so much better but there no fun element to it, it's just a Stat gain. But to each his own I guess."
heroesofthestorm,3e2kse,PaPa_ZeuS,3,Tue Jul 21 16:25:36 2015 UTC,"it's just a stat gain and also a ministun on every auto attack. That means not only are you bullshit hard to kill (fun), you're constantly fucking with the enemy (fun) while already using your silly disruption (fun) and - with the right talents - your frightening 1v1 burst damage (fun) to just generally be the biggest piece of shit in the entire fucking world, making everyone on the enemy team hate you, hate the game, and hate themselves (fun.)"
heroesofthestorm,3e2kse,somethingrelevant,3,Tue Jul 21 17:22:27 2015 UTC,"Making THEM focus you (fun, STONEFORM TO THE RESCUE).  Muradin is basically Murky with 20 times the hp."

Then you can get the refresh talent and do that shit all over again.  He may not be the most complex, but he can turn a fight in the right hands. I dunno, maybe I am biased because I throw hammers IRL."
heroesofthestorm,3e2kse,Saintblack,3,Tue Jul 21 17:02:09 2015 UTC,I like him because I don't play tanks much and he feels pretty much unkillable. Add a skillshot stun to the mix and he's a grand old time.

heroesofthestorm,3e2kse,Shedanigans,0,Tue Jul 21 15:48:38 2015 UTC,"I missed the prior polls, I'm shocked to see Jaina as one of the most fun to play assassins over Nova...she's a good hero and all and I guess it's fun winning, but you really just kinda stand as far back as you can spamming abilities.  Nova you get to do that sneak-sneak snipe greatness.  Also, if we're talking Warriors my boy Stitches is INCREDIBLY fun to play as...WAY more fun that Mura and even Jo.  Nothing's more satisfying than landing a long range hook on that Kael'thas jerkoff prancing on the back line and your team blowing him back to last year!  Nobody plays Stitches because he's considered UP though D:  Other than that, I must say the true most fun hero won...Murky's the best and Zeratul's damn fun too.  Good job reddit, I'm proud of you on this day."
heroesofthestorm,3e2kse,MilkRain,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed - Stitches is so much fun.   I guess his low win rate brings him down. But hooking enemies is the best.  Especially on Pirate bay when you hook them into your base as they try to take your Siege camp. Did it to a Valla once - highlight of my Stitches play. (Fun fact - Valla get's shit on in all my hero highlight reels. Eg. Valla taking tribute as lone survivor of a team fight only to get killed by my Abathur mine as she's taking the tribute and I can safely tunnel there and take the tribute).   We need a ""Most satisfying hero to kill""-Poll.   And the winner of that will be NOVA."
heroesofthestorm,3e2kse,Indarus1,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:22:23 2015 UTC,"Ooh, tough choice.   Personally, i'm torn between Zeratul, Jaina, and Abathur. Zeratul is probably my choice, though. Abathur is fun, but I can't find many times to play him in HL. Otherwise he'd get my vote."

heroesofthestorm,3e1i7r,Thefriendlyfaceplant,5,Tue Jul 21 06:06:46 2015 UTC,"Very good video, amazing idea. To go the extra mile and make it excellent, it would be beyond awesome to put the levels in the top left corner and the minimap on the bottom right one."
heroesofthestorm,3e1i7r,DaSnack,5,Tue Jul 21 11:36:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, wouldn't be too hard to do. I'll make more splitscreens in the future, perhaps with commentary. Video quality will be higher as well."
heroesofthestorm,3e1i7r,kaldonir,5,Tue Jul 21 11:48:01 2015 UTC,"To expand on that idea:  I find it kinda hard to follow what happens because you only see such a small part of the actual screen, and then it's of a weird aspect ratio. Maybe you could try a setup with 4 split screens:  1 for each viking, a fourth for the mini map, but the aspect ratio of each individual video stays 16:9 or whatever the video aspect ratio is."
heroesofthestorm,3e1i7r,DaSnack,3,Tue Jul 21 13:45:19 2015 UTC,"Good point. Once vikings are split you tap into a whole new layer of strategies, especially after the new patch change. (yes they got nerfed but mostly their group play, split play actually became slightly more powerful. I tried this out to show what vikings can do besides grouping and using their group abilities. The aspect ratio is 5:1 haha. Maybe the 4th cam could just be roaming to keep the focus on the main fight. Thanks for the feedback. I'm going to implement extra features to make the process more easy to follow."

heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,mhkehoe,5,Mon Jul 20 18:37:20 2015 UTC,"I don't have any kind of official confirmation, but there's NO WAY he soaks while in spirit mode...he'd be way OP if he could.  The amount of XP you give when you die is nowhere near the amount of XP you gain from soaking (at least until late game), so it really would be a viable strategy to just stay in lane harassing the enemy and dying/respawning while soaking all the while if you were getting XP that entire time.  Your XP numbers would be monstrous and you'd need to give 0 effort to get it!"

Uther and Tyrael are ghosts for a few seconds and then they return to fountain and their death timer begins, whereas Leoric dies immediately and is a ghost for his whole death timer and can go where he wants.

heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,Inquisitorsz,9,Mon Jul 20 23:37:34 2015 UTC,I think we're going to see lots of Leorics who respawn in the middle dangerous areas only to die all over again. Killing Leoric once will be worth 1-3 more kills.
heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,N8CCRG,12,Mon Jul 20 17:59:47 2015 UTC,Que Leoric players claiming it's okay to die because of death trait.   A 1:1 trade should almost always be beneficial though.
heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,player1337,47,Mon Jul 20 16:17:17 2015 UTC,"1:1 leoric for murky,  totally worth."
heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,Kasikeman,2,Mon Jul 20 16:23:34 2015 UTC,theres that almost word that everyone loves to ignore.
heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,thavleifrim,4,Tue Jul 21 12:53:22 2015 UTC,"If you trade your death for a high priority target like Jaina, Kael'thas, or Valla and your teams are even or you're behind, then yes, it's worth it.  If you trade for a split pusher or your team is ahead, it's not really worth it."
heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,BlazingRain,14,Mon Jul 20 17:06:50 2015 UTC,I would say NOPE!  if you're ahead it's not beneficial for sure... and if you behind then you better trade into high value target because your team may get wrecked if you traded solo tank for say a Gazlord...
heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,blergh_1,4,Mon Jul 20 16:23:43 2015 UTC,"Depends on a lot of variables, if you're fighting for an objective, for example, it might be worth to trade even if ahead. The positioning could be worth more than the xp difference."
heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,vibrunazo,5,Mon Jul 20 17:12:45 2015 UTC,Of course you should trade into something that's as relevant in a teamfight as you are yourself.
heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,player1337,2,Mon Jul 20 16:41:12 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if this is actually his design intent.  With equal levels a 1:1 trade with Leoric doesn't sound like a bad deal, he can continue to offer minor contributions while dead and will generally be back in action much quicker.  The question will be how this plays out when he's ahead or behind.  You don't really want to trade deaths when ahead due to the catchup mechanic, and you may not be able to get a 1:1 trade when behind."

heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,gonnabetoday,6,Mon Jul 20 17:32:23 2015 UTC,Maybe monk in 3 weeks and no hero after him in 3 weeks but the other map?
heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,Psykofish,3,Mon Jul 20 18:28:27 2015 UTC,Well there's been hints for diablo wizard making appearance. Could possibly be after monk
heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,Frydendahl,5,Mon Jul 20 19:26:28 2015 UTC,"The hints were just voice lines put in place for if the wizard hero is added. Many of the heroes in the game already have voice lines for other heroes that are currently missing from the game as well (it's easy to record a few voice lines when the voice actor is in the studio anyway).  Monk and the new map will be the end of the Diablo event: http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/game/events/eternal-conflict/  We also know we're getting a Starcraft warrior, so it will likely be the next hero after the monk."

I feel like we've heard far too little about the monk to get him three weeks from now. I'd love to be wrong though."
heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,Jackal_Legacy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:29:21 2015 UTC,We didn't even know the butcher was coming until like the 5th so I think it's totally plausible that we get the Monk in 3 weeks
heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,Frydendahl,2,Tue Jul 21 03:11:09 2015 UTC,"If they keep the 3 week schedule for heroes, I expect we will see the monk patch (+ Starcraft warrior) next week. Keep in mind we're supposed to get a new map as well, so it's likely that both the monk and map will be in the same patch, and we will have another 2 week PTR for the map."

heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,MilkRain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:02 2015 UTC,"Is anyone else worried that Leoric will be over-used when it comes to rushing low health cores.   Your core is down to 20%.   Leoric tries to bring it down. Get's it down to 15% then dies.  He reduces his death respawn thanks to nearby heroes clearing catapults and what-not.   He respawns and drops all his damage output on the core before dying.  Rince, repeat.  It'll be worse than any other hero trying to do it (except maybe Murky with a nearby egg, or Vikings with Play Again).   I realise that not all games come down to base races but the ones that do I think Leoric could be a deciding factor in many of them."
heroesofthestorm,3dyfjd,Xirias,29,Mon Jul 20 16:41:54 2015 UTC,"Or, the enemy team could bunker up and hard defend, farming the aggressive Leoric to get a level advantage, then kill Leoric and have 60 seconds to wipe the enemy team and push to win.

heroesofthestorm,3e39x0,ItsWayne,6,Tue Jul 21 16:59:29 2015 UTC,"Link to a nice interview  This should answer a lot of your questions about what is in store for the future of HL.  Relevant part if you don't want to read the whole thing:  ""Stevivor: You mentioned seasons, would that rank be resetting every season and does it have any effect on where you were before? Or is it just a fresh start every single time?  Alan: No there is an effect. Number one is that we do still maintain your skill rating. That carries from season to season and doesn’t get wiped out. From the very beginning of a new season to the very end of a new season we want you to have an evenly matched game. We don’t want this situation where at the start of a new season if everyone got reset and we are matching based on your ranking that it doesn’t end up being like the Wild West – we want it to be an accurate matchup. Your skill rating still maintains, your rank however (which is your visual placement of your skill) will be reset and you’ll play a few placement matches again on the next season, but it will be far fewer because the system now knows a tonne of more information about you. Then after those few placement matches you’ll be placed into your rank again. So the progress that you had made previously [you’ll maintain], unless you end playing badly and losing all your placement matches. There is an aspect where your previous performance and your performance during the placement matches will decided where you are in the new season."""

heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Zorki1969,152,Mon Jul 20 17:11:26 2015 UTC,"We're investigating, i've passed on the information and my thoughts to our League Ops - but from what I can see without going in to too much detail, it looks intentional."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,kaelaris,49,Mon Jul 20 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"Regarding the occurrence A, it should be super simple to figure that out with a replay file. Follow the camera and check what he does. I suspect that location hotkeys are used to quickly change the screen to the battle. Clicking the minimap and then a hero might just be too slow. In addition to that, it is weird to accidentally activate shadow charge if you are on a lane for several seconds farming to 20. I think it is fairly impossible to accidentally pull that off as the player is certainly aware where his Zeratul was...  Regarding the occurrence B, it is fairly hidden, but if you know how to do it, you would definitely charge at the wall & then switch targets instead of running the whole way mounted.  Doing it twice is certainly not an accident for high level players. It is a rare occurrence that they 'accidentally' use heroics and benefit from that. => I argue for clearly intentional.  Another usage can be found here, too. As the initial speed's activation distance is 4 which is less than a usual ranged attack which has 5.5 range, Zeratul cannot directly start charging at Jaina. But in the video, he still charges to Jaina which can only be done via changing targets in the correct moment. But the ""bug"" is just the knowledge that you can switch targets and I am sure that the bug is fairly often used in many matches on battle.net without the players actually having knowledge of it (-> unintentional). Thus, it is fairly difficult to draw a line with this bug because it was/is always present and was used without the players clear knowledge that it is a bug. But was never seriously used to its full extend until now, though. At least in the first scene they seem to have intentionally hoped for the enemy to engage vs lvl 20 as the enemy thought Zeratul would have been too far away making it a 4vs5."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Ahli,34,Mon Jul 20 18:15:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the 1st occurrence is pretty damning evidence. All you have to do is watch the zeratul portrait in the minimap and watch him turn into the flash and zoom accross 1/3rd of the map lol"
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,clab2021,12,Mon Jul 20 19:14:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel it was certainly used as an exploit and the difference between thinking you have a 5v4 when in fact it's a 5v5 can be huge. The rehgar exploit, which seems to be of similar nature was way less exploitive, I'm not sure if there was any ruling about using that in competitive but this Zeratul exploit should either be known to all if not outright banned to avoid abusing a hidden and obviously unintended bug.  The first one I guess you could be bias for MVP and attribute it to a visual error due to the Zeratul shout before he was visible on our screen - perhaps he was talking about how Zeratul wasn't there but not sure.  But the second one you can see him being far behind everyone else and comes dashing in at a crazy speed, the other casters now comments on this range in the second video and apprehensively attributes it to the level 20 upgrade."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Draig_Goch,2,Mon Jul 20 19:10:52 2015 UTC,"In the first one, he charges at an enemy minion and then turns around heading across the map towards the team fight. I assume Zeratul ran towards the top right side before activating shadow assault to prepare that bug-move.  Thus, a replay would most likely easily tell what Zeratul did, if we just follow the player's camera (-> double-tap the hotkey ""7"")."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Ahli,6,Mon Jul 20 22:21:28 2015 UTC,"I agree, that it wasnt an accident. And that they were using it intenrionally."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,dw_gela,9,Mon Jul 20 19:10:58 2015 UTC,"Also, fight on trib wasnt lost by VP, like someone said, and i agree, that they engaged, coz they thought zera isnt here, and then he appears..."

heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Nilxain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:14:16 2015 UTC,"But the ""here"" scene is not really expressing much as that reflects a more usual case that is likely to occur in multiple games without the player necessarily knowing that he is using a bug. That could have easily occurred in every random game (given anyone would actually play Shadow Assault) without knowledge of the bug.  The important scenes are the first two ones I have listed, if you want to argue about ""intended bug-usage"" or not because they display where it can give you quite an advantage."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Ahli,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:16:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah the other 2 accent it much more that's for sure.

I think Schamtoo casted that tournament so he might've some information on his Twitter about it. It wasn't too long ago."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,GhinHoTS,6,Mon Jul 20 21:28:43 2015 UTC,"I'd like to copy my comment from the original post (haven't seen that copy while writing it):    Zera stands away from team, in that sample, given that BW has Peekaboo, and Tassa has his trait. BW uses Z right when the team arrives to tribute location - there's no Zera around. Tassa uses D before the fight - there's no Zera around. The fact Zera stays out of vision range to affect opponents decision, then uses ""undocumented feature"" of his ability.(trained a lot, it looks not easy, and he does it again near the end of match, too) to jump in - it's far from sportsmanship and fair play.  I don't think it affected the result of game. Still, the more I think of it and view VODs, the more I'm convinced this is an intended abuse. I believe SA is not designed to work in that way. And people don't expect Zera to jump from outside granted vision range in split second."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,shaitanama,4,Mon Jul 20 19:03:02 2015 UTC,"I agree it's hard to say if it would've affected the overall game, but it definitely affected at least one tribute fight, and even 1 team fight in this game can cause a complete turn around (just see game 2 of C9 Malestrom and Tempo Storm in the semi finals sunday for proof)."

heroesofthestorm,3dysue,bircenteyzen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:45 2015 UTC,"At this point I kinda agree with Ahli that it is not clearly abuse, but it is almost certainly intentional .. like he says, people have likely been mal-using this ability in an equivalent manner without knowledge. And some of them might figure it out and continue using it. In truth the tooltip text doesn't specify how it should behave (no mention of targets, attack range -- which it changes -- and clearly continues for 6 seconds) you could argue that it seemed intentional design for most people ""abusing"" it in more mundane ways.   Blizzard will certainly have to make a definite stance on whether they consider it a bug before anyone could call it abuse formally. The tooltip text for the heroic might need to be changed too... to something like ""Your basic attacks cause you to charge at enemies within your natural range of vision and have 20% increased attack speed. Lasts 6 seconds."""

heroesofthestorm,3dysue,kaelaris,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:35:24 2015 UTC,Hey (different guys) I understand you can't talk about the decision making but I was wondering if there was an update on this issue or when we might expect one. Also for these decisions do esl set time limits on when it was found out a bug happened (abused or not) and by when a response has to be made and how it might effect the decision?  Like if it wasn't found out a bug happened until 2 months down the road what would happen. I'm just curious how these things are dealt with by esl :)
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,gronmin,27,Tue Jul 21 15:48:02 2015 UTC,"I really don't think the game was over at all, because Virtus got the early pick on Malfurion during that fight, and they got it BECAUSE they saw that zeratul was no where near the fight, so they hard engaged, thinking they had a 5v4 advantage.  Let me explain - you can see both teams posturing around the tribute - Virtus wanting to fight before MVP gets 20, MVP wanting to stall to get 20. Virtus can't see zera of course, but they are expecting MVP to be trying to get 20, and they can see 4 members of MVP at the trib. So they think, maybe Zeratul is in lane somewhere, passively soaking. Tassadar uses his trait, and doesn't see Zera at the trib. So now they really think he might not be there - then they see him break cloak in lane, presumably trying to get just the last couple minions to get 20: you can see all of a sudden when Zera shows in lane, he gets pinged a million times (I'm assuming Virtus is pinging him, cause why would MVP ping him), and then Virtus starts being really aggressive, trying to force a fight, because they know Zeratul can't get there for at least a couple seconds. They succeed, getting Malfurion, and then think they have 5v3 for a few more seconds. But the Zeratul exploit completely changes the fight. Virtus used everything on Malf (well, at least all of Jaina's damage burst) and now they have nothing against the Zeratul who miraculously appears right away, now lvl 20. MVP may well have still won that game, but maybe not - that was certainly the deciding fight, and it would have been completely different without the exploit."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,DaronAcemoglu,2,Mon Jul 20 18:56:57 2015 UTC,Agreed. Virtus made a great read there and were punished for it because Zeratul did something they had no idea was possible.
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,DoktorZaius,6,Tue Jul 21 06:10:02 2015 UTC,That sounds a lot like Zeratul started wave clearing in order to give the other team the impression that he wouldn't make it there on time. I doubt this is the first time that player has done it. No wonder he didn't take VP.
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,ProfessionalSlackr,4,Mon Jul 20 20:42:30 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, that should be declared intentional misdirection with intent to cheat. Virtus definitely based their tactics on the fact that they could tell Zera was nowhere nearby, but then MVP uses the exploit to trick Virtus. That's not exactly fair.   I mean, honestly, the more likely scenario would have been Zera floats out of range of Tass's D, but still cloaked. Virtus doesn't see Zera and comes to conclusion he could be anywhere and refrains from hard engaging, thus likely changing the outcome of that team fight. By engaging the minions in lane and decloaking, Zera is telling Virtus, ""Oh, Zera is not a part of this fight, have at it."" Then, bam, he zips in from nowhere and pummels them. That's underhanded and unsportsmanlike."

heroesofthestorm,3dysue,DRIVE_BY_GUY,4,Mon Jul 20 21:09:18 2015 UTC,"YouTube video of a bit more extreme abuse.  I was able to reproduce this bug/exploit very reliably (probably 75% of attempts) after just a few minutes of practice. With the right method, it is very easy to do. I was even able to reliably do it multiple times within a single shadow assault duration, ping ponging back and forth across the map.  Steps to reproduce:   Stand near any enemy target (hero, minion, building) - close enough for a normal shadow assault teleport, but outside melee range Attack-move on the ground (easiest to target the ground near your final target) Very quickly attack your intended target (after your hero starts to warp to the target in step 1, but before you reach that target)   Note that you must have a clear path to the target. When I tried the long-range version by blinking over the wall instead of destroying it, Zeratul got stuck at the wall and just ran in place next to it for several seconds instead of passing through."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Grumbul,5,Tue Jul 21 11:42:31 2015 UTC,This seems to be grounds for disqualification. Practicing the exploitation of a game feature well enough to be able to use it in this manner is clearly immoral. the proper way for MVP to handle this was to report it as a bug so everyone knows about it. At that point it would've been up to blizzard to fix.
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Oldini,22,Tue Jul 21 06:38:54 2015 UTC,"I'd say just picking Shadow Assault is evidence that they planned this, unless Shadow Assault is the prevailing meta in that region."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,skwipwork,44,Mon Jul 20 17:37:26 2015 UTC,The fact he activated it so far from the fight shows they knew what it did imo. No reason to activate it where he was.
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Gladders1980,10,Mon Jul 20 18:24:35 2015 UTC,"Didn't even consider that, but you are completely right. No way they accidently did this, as why would a pro team make such a noob mistake as to activate a super like that so far from a fight"
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,clab2021,20,Mon Jul 20 19:17:57 2015 UTC,"I think it shows it was planned because look how zeratul is split from the team and getting merc camps during a tribute. He then is able to immediately get into the fight making it so vp wasnt expecting him there since he just capped a camp. They could have taken a 4v5 there since they knew he was split, but him getting into the fight faster is an obvious exploit they were using.  Edit: and further, why use shadow assault on a random tower/wall/whatever if not meaning to exploit it to get into the fight?"
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,kowzzzz,10,Mon Jul 20 18:06:57 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. There's no way they would have picked SA if they didn't plan to use it this way. VP is literally the single best ability in the game, and without exploiting, SA is awful."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Minitell,8,Mon Jul 20 18:19:01 2015 UTC,"Yes it's a exploit, and yes it's apparent they used it. The question now is should they be punished for it?  Firstly the other team thought it was a 4v5, knowing zeratul's current position and knowing it wasn't falstad/etc/illidan or any other cross map teleport hero, so they should be punished somehow.  Then again, if this shadow assault bug becomes widely accepted and since it takes a siginificant amount of practice even with location hotkeys, it might just be allowed until either patched (or on a rare occasion, left in the game). I don't find it significantly broken in a hunt like dive first only, but we'll see. (it is global map teleport at lvl 10, and can you imagine the split lane dmg if someone perfected it? Hey I'm getting ganked... and now I'm killing top fort instead)  Edit: Found a way easier way to do it. Position yourself a decent distance from an enemy structure/creep, look at the heroes, a-click near but not on a hero, then immediately a-click on the hero. The attack move will initiate the dive needed for the exploit. Probably what they did as you don't need to set up a camera hotkey and then locate where your target is. Sorry if the explanation isn't too clear.  Regardless, League OPs decision will be final, and I'll respect it either way."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,KashikoiKawai-Darky,3,Mon Jul 20 21:34:00 2015 UTC,I think the fairest thing would be to have them play the series over again. Fresh start with a ruling on this exploit.
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,DoktorZaius,63,Tue Jul 21 06:16:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's because I come from the fighting game community but I don't see the problem with this. Heck, some of the coolest moments of Starcraft eSports history come from skilled players abusing bugs to their advantage (remember mineral pathing?).   The largest Street Fighter and MvC3 tournament happend over the weekend, and you better believe that Fuzzy guarding, unblockables, Kara throwing, and all sorts of exploits were used by every single one of the competitors.  Bugs are in the game. Can't blame the team for using them. To be honest, I think it's cool they used it.   This is different from maphacking or using a 3rd party program. This is an exploit found within the game. Are we gonna go back and take away wins from teams who used to look at the siege damage and know when the other team is doing a boss? Weren't they exploiting a game mechanic that blizzard didn't intend?  Kudos to MVP black for finding it out and using it. Let's not pretend this caused them to win or that they would of lost without it. They outplayed Virtus.pro plain and simple."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Dorazion,32,Mon Jul 20 18:31:33 2015 UTC,"""Clever use of game mechanics"" vs. exploiting is always a fuzzy line.    If a bug that gives an advantage is known, the onus is on the competitors to decide how much of an advantage it will give and whether they should utilize it or not."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,trident00,2,Mon Jul 20 19:03:27 2015 UTC,It is a fuzzy line and that is the reason why MVP Black should NOT be punished. Either Blizzard needs to make that line EXTREMELY clear or punish everyone who has ever used an unintended game mechanic (Siege Dmg to figure out boss).
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,S0NOfG0D,0,Tue Jul 21 01:49:53 2015 UTC,"that's cleary a bug so ""clever use of game mechanics"" dont apply. because heroic is not working as intended."

heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Jabari11,4,Mon Jul 20 19:21:25 2015 UTC,"They are only allowed because Capcom has the policy of banning only the most game breaking glitches. And by game breaking I truly mean that, the game shuts off or is unable to resolve.  Capcom doesn't ban powerful exploits, meta shifting exploits, or exploits that are ""unfair"". In the competitive community there, everything is essentially fair game. That is why those techniques exist and the game grows in complexity all the time.  When I see this advanced zeratul trick, I see it as a cool opportunity to change the way we see zeratul. Why patch it out? It's hard to do and is only effective when used strategically. This isn't Azmo minions + Tass shields territory (which could be considered game breaking.)  fun trivia: The first 2 hit combo was a glitch! It wasn't intended and clever players found out how to string hits together."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Dorazion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:30:33 2015 UTC,Yeah but I don't want bans in competitive HOTS to be based on which heroes have the most exploitable bugs.  That doesn't seem healthy for the scene.
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,ShakeSignal,11,Tue Jul 21 14:44:46 2015 UTC,"The difference is that in a game like this, where you are on the map makes a huge difference. In fighting games you are facing each other so you always know where your opponent is. Virtus made a decision to engage the other team because it looked like they were down zeratul.  It completely changes the way you would play this game. If, for example, they had Illidan with the hunt instead of zeratul, then Virtus would know ""ok we can engage but illidan can just use his ult to reach us. Thats something zeratul shouldn't be able to do.  It's something that completely changes how a team should think about an engagment and peoples map position based on a bug/something that shouldn't be possible."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,clab2021,13,Mon Jul 20 19:22:16 2015 UTC,They outplayed Virtus.pro plain and simple.   It probably would have been better if they knew Zeratul had global presence and they didn't used two heroes just to detect him...

heroesofthestorm,3dysue,wibc,3,Tue Jul 21 14:29:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If this exploit is to be punished, all the players playing a hero with a bug not intended by Blizzard (for example, Li Li's serpent bug, BW's self double healing, Reghar's Feral Lunge, etc.) should also be to blame. It's not to the point that some bugs are negligible and thus easily forgiven while others are game-changing and thus should be punished. A bug is a bug howsoever big or small it is. Uther was automatically banned a month ago in a Chinese tournament (Kael'thas' Cup if I remember right) because he had a bug (I don't know what that was though), while players in other regions played him just fine."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,kakanien,4,Mon Jul 20 19:45:05 2015 UTC,The BW and LiLi bug were also something players had no control over (well lili you kind of did as you had to pick the healing serpent and bounce attack talents).  BW was just a glitch that you couldn't fix. This Zeratul bug is something that is not easy to execute and has to be very intentionally performed to take advantage of it. Basically it would be easy for MVP Black to not have used the bug at all.

Or the Kerrigan Cleave+Battle Momentum.  Hell, I remember in Cataclysm, a patch bugged Ret pallies to do an obscene amount of damage, and a good amount of guilds took advantage to get Deathwing kills, and none of those guys got their kills taken away.

The list goes on. Developer should come forward and say: ""we tested it and yes there is a bug which will be fixed asap."" What happens here is community is putting MVP Black in front of execution squad for mearly playing the game. Do we de-rank all players who abused Lili's bug to get to Rank 1? Of course not. They did nothing wrong and the same applies to MVP Black.  What about the Dark Arts vs. Last One game where Last One used Tyrael Sanctification bug (where he couldnt get stunned while channeling)?

You really can't just throw around the term game breaking like this. This doesn't break the game. A scrubby team can't just use this vs Tempo Storm and get free wins. This is some added utility to Zeratul in niche situations.   Everyone realizes for this to even be a factor, you have to sacrifice void prison right?  Is being able to split push with Zeratul on a 100 second cool down better then void prison? Or are people just pearl clutching because of the world ""exploit""?"

Which of his ults is the better one? I still think Void Prison is the superior choice, but maybe you can find nice uses for Shadow Assault. If something is ""game breaking"", it should be your first option no matter what because ""game breaking"".  It ""broke"" the match because it was unexpected, not because with was game-breaking.

heroesofthestorm,3dysue,polakovoador,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:08:53 2015 UTC,"If it's a feature then that is completely fine because players know to expect it. You are completely right that it's unexpectedness is why it ""broke"" the game, but it broke the game none the less.  The thing is, in every online game I have played, it is against the Terms of Service to knowingly exploit game features that would give you an advantage. This is true in everything from an exploit that would make you money or earn you xp faster, to exploits that give you an unfair advantage over other players in combat.  Plenty games I have played have gone back and banned/punished players for abusing systems like these regardless of whether their actions directly affected someone else or not.   Keep in mind this happens to normal players that aren't competing for money or anything.  MVP Black on the otherhand were participating in a tournament that was streamed and still choose to knowingly break this agreement.    I will concede that I could be wrong (sorry haven't read the entire ToS of heros of the storm lol) but blizzard does have this in their wow TOS so  I think it's safe to assume the have it in this game as well.  For a professional team to knowingly break the rules is just not good, and should be punished if simply to make a statement. If we want e-sports to become legit, then it has to be taken as seriously as real sports where everything is highly controlled to make the game as fair as possible."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,clab2021,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:31:48 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with you, but as pointed out above, exploring the mechanics of the game and exploiting are very fuzzy definitions.   Was everyone exploiting Illidan's invicibilty frames pre-patch? I mean, Blizzard's official position is that they were not intended... The only difference is everyone knew about them and had to work with them.  Do you think this bug should get Zeratul banned until hot-fixed? I don't think so, since teams can play around it (and most players will use Void Prison anyway)."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,polakovoador,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:51 2015 UTC,"As it is Zeratul is almost always a first ban hero anyway, but no I don't think this should cause him to be completely banned.  This bug just needs to be well known and decided if it's ok to exploit or not. If so the enemy team should instantly know that if zeratul picks shadow charge he is doing so for the hunt like benefit."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,clab2021,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:58:20 2015 UTC,Unfair comparison.   Everyone who plays SF knows about these techniques and has been left in by Capcom for many many years now until it becomes the norm for certain games which in return makes it all above board and legal.   Hover your mouse of Zeratul's ability.  What does it say?  Does it state anywhere that is allows you to use it like that?  No it doesn't.  This ain't no fightan game son - apples and oranges much?  Regardless if it's allowed or not.  It's down right dirty and scummy.   At least the FGC shares there stuff.
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,CLICK_HERE_TO_WIN,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:34:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that everyone who plays SF knows about these techniques.  In a game like USF4, there are 44 characters, each with multiples more moves than a character in HotS has (auto-attack, and roughly 5 abilities not including generics, vs six buttons with differences in far, close, crouching, and aerial, sometimes differences in neutral jump vs angled jump, as well as special moves of differing properties based on which button pressed).  The combination of these different moves means that there is still undiscovered technology even within the game which has been around since 2008. I play it competitively and follow the scene quite closely, and every once in a while I STILL see an unblockable or fuzzy guard setup in a tournament that I've never seen before. It's not true that the FGC always shares, especially when it relates to tech that could potentially be game-winning when pulled out in the right circumstance.  If you're saying that people know that unblockables exist, then that doesn't really change the discussion. Knowing they exist doesn't help you counter them if you don't know the specific situations in which you can be hit by them.  It's not that different from not knowing."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Exvaris,2,Tue Jul 21 01:58:57 2015 UTC,"Anyone who plays in a tournament settings knows about it otherwise they ain't lasting too long.  Take this years EVO finals.   I didn't see any unknown tech being used at all in that match. Yeah, sure you might have some new tech being figured out every few years but this is just so different.  It's a dumb comparison.    And btw, if you haven't figured out most match ups to some competent extent after 7 years  then something is wrong.  There is a reason why players like Infiltration have there lil notes handy on their phone in between sets for specific matchups.   Stupid comparison.   We all know blizzard had no intentions of Zeratul's ult doing that and they never will.  It'll be patched I guarantee it.  When playing fightan games I KNOW all that tech exists before we hit confirm on that select screen."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,CLICK_HERE_TO_WIN,6,Tue Jul 21 02:11:20 2015 UTC,Is this similar to the pre nerf Rehgar Feral Lunge?
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,mffancy,11,Mon Jul 20 17:59:12 2015 UTC,"Somewhat in execution, but vastly different in power. The Feral Lunge only let you jump to another target in the normal lunge range. This lets you charge across the entire map."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Evilmon2,2,Mon Jul 20 19:03:22 2015 UTC,Did anyone actually test that the second/third/fourth lunges WERE ACTUALLY only possible for targets within range?
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Kaeoz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:47:40 2015 UTC,"I did. Basically all chain lunging was just auto attack canceling. You dashed to a normal target, but then clicked something else mid-dash and you just wouldn't perform the attack and stay in ghost wolf form.   Since it was mechanically identical to orbwalking and not extremely powerful I assumed it was intended."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Evilmon2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:51:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was quite obvious. Chain lunging was significantly more difficult, since you had to find a new target within lunge range to continue the chain."

heroesofthestorm,3dysue,airfoam,10,Tue Jul 21 00:28:09 2015 UTC,NaVi won a game against TongFu in TI3 (I think?) using fountain hooks with Pudge and Chen.
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,ramkonghaeng,5,Tue Jul 21 00:47:49 2015 UTC,"Tiny - Tossing a unit causes it to take the avalanche damage twice. Tiny is still a mediocre hero so this bug was left in the game and because a feature.  Blink Dagger - Clicking outside of its maximum blink range causes blink dagger to only blink 960 range instead of its maximum 1200. I still heavily advocate against this but there are some hardcore dota players that insist on keeping this bug alive.  Ursa - His ability lets him solo Roshan. Intentional? Who knows. If it was any other game it would probably have been patched out a long time ago.  Illusions - Melee illusions get mana burn while ranged illusions don't. Most other unique ability modifiers don't work on illusions. Illusions get Radiance burn effect, but not other auras. There's a ton of different rules regarding illusions which started out as engine limitations of warcraft 3 but at this point they are all part of Dota 2  Black King Bar - Could use its own encyclopedia to list out all the different interactions and exceptions with this item. Once again, a result of engine limitations within the warcraft 3 engine but became part of Dota 2  The fountain-hook bug deserves a mention even though it was eventually patched out because it was well known that Valve themselves said they ""deemed it too hilarious to fix."" It was intentionally left in the game for two years until the community said enough was enough (resulting from Na'Vi vs TongFu at TI3)   Similarly we have Ghost Scepter interaction with arrow effects (namely Huskar) who was a nightmare following the patch his berseker's blood got reworked. It was left in the game for years until this specific interaction with Huskar was deemed too powerful."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,hyperben,2,Tue Jul 21 01:34:45 2015 UTC,"Stacking was unintentional bug, now it's core mechanic. A lot of things that in game now, started just as a bug, some of them stay in game forever, some get patched couple years later (rip fountain hooks), but unless it's straight up engine mistake in calculations (extra dmg, healing etc.) no one considers it's as exploit."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,staluxa,11,Tue Jul 21 05:29:55 2015 UTC,"Short answer : yes.  Long answer : see below.  If they could watch his screen and his clicks from a replay to see if he was intentionally doing this would be best.   But if it was on purpose, regardless if they were going to win anyways, an exploit is an exploit and should be punished appropriately. Edit: it is very obvious that they did this on purpose.  Notice zeratul split and taking the camp, making vp think they can 4v5 and get back into the game, and then zeratul teleports in. Obvious exploit as you cant do those clicks on accident.  If anyone watched evo, in usf4 finals momochi's controller bugged out and he had to forfeit a round. It wasnt his fault at all but the rules are the rules. not applicable because this was clearly on purpose."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,kowzzzz,10,Mon Jul 20 17:49:56 2015 UTC,"For the occurance with the tribute, I honestly think, even without seeing all that you mentioned, it's hard to deny it was intentional.  After all, why would a pro player use Zeratuls ult that far from the fight? Normally it would've run out of time before he even got to the tribute fight (if you just watch where his portrait is on the minimap he was a decent ways away).  Only the noobiest player would waste an ult, even on accident. No way would a pro player waste their ult."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,clab2021,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:25:10 2015 UTC,"Doesnt really matter if it was on purpose or not, if there were rules which prohibited these kind of exploits, yea punish them. If not why and how do you want to punish a smart team that is not breaking official rules? Blame the tournament organizers for not having explicit rules which do not allow gamebreaking (not intentional from the game developers point) exploits if 2. is the case"
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Lacky_Acee,-3,Tue Jul 21 07:29:13 2015 UTC,"IMO, it's the fault of the developers for not addressing the issue. If there's an exploit in a game, then it should be fair game to use. This is unless there is a specific rule that states this bug is illegal in tournament play.  SSB: Melee is the best instance of this. Wavedashing/Wavelanding are bugs that are exploited every single competitive game. Fighting game communities are known to use bugs during tournies, and the game's company can patch out the bug if it's necessary."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,SmashingIC,3,Mon Jul 20 19:20:47 2015 UTC,"Just because it wasn't caught in development doesn't mean that it was intended behavior. Considering how difficult it is to pull off, I would've been surprised if they had found the issue before making it to production."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,ProfessionalSlackr,3,Mon Jul 20 20:49:56 2015 UTC,"People must stop comparing FGC to this. They're completely different genre with completely different styles and play.  It's a false comparison, stop doing it.  Even so: Do you really think if you got to the Smash finals, and one of the contestants had found a bug that let you auto-out someone while they're at 25% every time, that the tournament organizers wouldn't step in? Don't fucking kid yourself. They'd jump right on that."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,isaightman,5,Tue Jul 21 04:54:16 2015 UTC,What if it's an undiscovered (to the public) bug where you can completely remove a character from the game?  We've had those sort of bugs in the past and I'm sure that under very specific conditions bugs like these are still in the game.
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,dejarnjc,5,Mon Jul 20 20:08:34 2015 UTC,"i mean, it's 100% obvious that the Zeratul ult is not meant to work as a map-wide gapcloser, you don't really need the developer to tell you that"
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Edirith,2,Mon Jul 20 19:58:09 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they still ban stuff in SSB.
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,dirtymonkey,2,Mon Jul 20 20:17:10 2015 UTC,"Not typically. They typically only ban glitches that cause the game to freeze. Infinite grabs and wavesdashing/landing are examples of glitches that affect gameplay, but are allowed."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,SmashingIC,4,Mon Jul 20 20:40:56 2015 UTC,"If you want to equate it SSB then, and we go by your first statement ""it's the fault of the developers for not addressing the issue"" then lets take a look at newer versions of Smash where it is easier for the developers to update the game, because let's be honest you're talking about melee and not Wii U or 3ds Smash.   Both the Wii U and 3ds SSB4 are constantly updated with bug fixes.     If Nintendo knew about things like wave dashing from the start and had the ability patch it would we still have it?     So back to Blizzard.   I'm guessing they'll fix this.   If not then it will be up to tournaments on how they decide to allow Zeratul.   I guess easiest thing would be to just ban that one talent as then people could still use Zeratul."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,dirtymonkey,3,Mon Jul 20 20:52:12 2015 UTC,"Knowing Sakurai... he would have taken it out lol.  My point is that I would not penalize the players for using a glitch in-game. It didn't crash the game, and it obviously required some practice. Instead of punishing, just patch it out. I don't see any reason why the players should be punished for pushing the game to its limitations, whether purposeful or not."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,SmashingIC,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:55:58 2015 UTC,"because you have to make a line somewhere, next week someone might find a glitch that lets you oneshot people, does whichever team that figures that one out just get a free pass for that game/tournament?"

If anything it sort of emphasizes that Nintendo would change stuff after releasing the game if possible.

heroesofthestorm,3dysue,dirtymonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:27:57 2015 UTC,"wrt infinite grabs, it's noteworthy to add that many maps are banned (ie ones with walkoffs) because of how infinite grabs work with them"
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,cakesphere,2,Tue Jul 21 07:35:05 2015 UTC,"This is a big misrepresentation of wavedashing- it was known to exist during the development period, and isn't a bug, just a corner-case of the SSBM physics engine. It wasn't seen to be that big of a deal when first discovered and was left in the game, but the competitive scene caused it to evolve into being incorporated into playstyles. Then it was removed in future installments.  source: http://smashboards.com/threads/dispute-ended-new-sakurai-intervew-wavedashing-was-intentional.162416/"
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,GhostToGotham,2,Mon Jul 20 22:01:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Anything that is an 'exploit', which isn't specifically banned, should be fair game."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,_wutdafuc,7,Mon Jul 20 22:17:21 2015 UTC,"This is more a case of IEM not knowing about the exploit, I'm pretty sure that tournament organizers have banned certain heroes due to similar game changing bugs in the past.  The Sanctification bug for example allowed teams to have a safe haven without chance of interruption, it was promptly banned from tournament play because it grossly changed the way the ability functioned."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Draig_Goch,2,Mon Jul 20 19:31:07 2015 UTC,Maybe this is a tactic to showcase the exploit in almost certain win game to get zeratul banned? :D

heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Urlich_Firelord,7,Mon Jul 20 22:14:30 2015 UTC,"Of course it is intentional. Nothing wrong with that though, it hasn't been officially deemed a bug."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,JamesDickens,0,Mon Jul 20 23:10:05 2015 UTC,"But it is a bug. Zeratul's ult is not supposed to work that way == ability bug.  Once anyone finds an exploit, it's a bug."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Chieffelix472,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:52:57 2015 UTC,"Well technically, it's most likely not a bug. The software didn't fail, the programing didn't fail, it's just the unintended mechanic that's part of the game. They probably programed it to something like: If auto-attack target is within range x, then jump zeratul towards aa target.  Of course we can see how this works now, aa target was in range, program says jump to that target and auto attack, target was changed mid jump, but zeratul still jumps to the auto attack target, which is now cross map and the initiate part of the code already triggered and is in the ""jump zeratul"" state.  I know, it really doesn't have to do with the issue at hand, but it's probably not (technically) a bug because it's not defective code. Definitely an exploitation of game mechanics though. Kinda like how wavedashing is an unintended consequence of wavelanding in super smash bros melee. The more you know right?"
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,KashikoiKawai-Darky,8,Mon Jul 20 23:24:51 2015 UTC,"What you just described is what a bug is. Bugs don't need to make the program crash or fail. If something isn't working as intended it's a bug.  Wavedashing is a bug too, but most people like that and agree it makes the game more fun.  Idk, it's just semantics at this point. I think it's a bug but I understand why some people don't, and that's ok."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Chieffelix472,2,Mon Jul 20 23:49:15 2015 UTC,"A bug is something that works differently than the specification says. The closest thning we have to the specification is the ability's description. The description says nothing about jumping half the map with the ability. Thus, it is probably a bug.   Of course, judjing from what we have, I'd say that the implementation specification probably includes only the part about jumping to the target and this is an unexpected use-case of the ability. I'd say that the playtesters/functional testers were not thorugh enough in this case and they did not test this scenario. Of course this is just a tip based on my FT experience."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,MorphHu,2,Tue Jul 21 01:12:21 2015 UTC,"Is it possible, to use the A + move combo and then click on a structure and repeat until you dash? This might be a feasible way to jump whole screen since you don't need to be visible on your screen for the attack move to trigger."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Delta-Sniper,2,Tue Jul 21 12:01:11 2015 UTC,"Previous bugs have been known in advance and explicitly banned, by banning certain characters or just making it known that they are considered bugs. This is a new situation, it is not like MVP could possibly think nobody would notice and were openly using a mechanical edge case rather than scripting (assuming it wasn't scripted :D), so it's a bit of a weird situation.  Whatever they decide to do about it here sets a precedent - in this case personally I think they should give virt pro the option to replay the match as a bo3, and explicitly state that that particular bug is a disqualification if used."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,ry__ry,2,Mon Jul 20 19:38:05 2015 UTC,"This is so obviously an exploit, we should just ban Zeratul in every game that we can so we don't see it-- oh wait, we already do.   This seems like a clear exploitation of the game from that team. Not only did they use Shadow Assault on creeps, it requires insane APM (at least it seems so) to actually do this, because there's only a SPLIT SECOND where it becomes global. Also, why didn't NOBODY notice or at least pause the game to check this?"
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Indarus1,7,Tue Jul 21 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"Well, it seems to me that they obviously knew how this trick works. But I don't see how they could be punished for it. They just play the game, they don't use a third party programm or any hack.  If this is an exploit, then we should consider the old Abathur backdoor as an exploit. Or the classic blood for blood stack as an exploit. Or even capping DK under a shield. Because in both cases, I'm pretty sure game designers did not expect players to use these skills that way."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,BaptisteVillain,13,Tue Jul 21 04:13:02 2015 UTC,"I would compare this more to the Abathur infinite burrow exploit or the Tyrael Sanctification exploit.  The examples you gave are players using heroes or abilities according to their description, my examples and this trick are exploits."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Draig_Goch,3,Mon Jul 20 19:19:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  Banned exploits should be called out specifically, otherwise you are hindering creativity.  Exploits are in that grey area, where new games can develop from them (see tribes/quake).   Now if this is against the tournament terms, then actions should take place.  If not I see no real harm, especially with a ban system.    But I do not know what the terms were with this tournament."

heroesofthestorm,3dysue,Amezis,22,Mon Jul 20 19:47:46 2015 UTC,It was used twice in total I believe. Both in very suspicious instances where Zeratul is far from the important theaters of conflict.

Can anyone comment on if this could have won them the game over his previous positioning?"
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,howboutthatshit,2,Mon Jul 20 18:14:17 2015 UTC,"Whether its intentional isnt even questionable. He pops shadow assault miles away from the teamfight, charges a wall (in at least one instance), and zips into the teamfight. Nothing accidental about that sequence of events."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,havoK718,2,Mon Jul 20 18:18:22 2015 UTC,"I can't tell too much really, if it was intentional it was probably the reason zeratul was out of place in the first place and they might have used it to use zeratul as a splitpush hero a la falstad/brightwing.  From what I saw of the match though MVP black was playing much better than virtus pro and i didn't notice this bug at all so I think they would win anyway.  But that's besides the point, intentional abuse of something is clearly a bug is always forbidden. So if it was intentional it should surely be punished, although not as harsh perhaps. And this is quite clearly an exploit whereas for example feral lunge was not as you didn't fly all over the map with that."

State something that it looked suspicious but can't tell for sure and just let it slide. If you make official it was exploiting it's also creating a situation that they are forced to do something about it which they probably don't want, reverting the situation or let Virtus be victors suddenly is difficult to do, especially as the situation wasn't that bad to begin with.   It's like when the referee made a mistake in football. They'll rarely fully acknowledge it and just say something vague that they may have misjudged a bit or something. Just because it's so difficult to really do something about it."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,werfmark,3,Mon Jul 20 18:43:22 2015 UTC,"Damn I tried it many times to do it exactly like this but failed. Now I try again after reading your post and could reproduce it many times.  I did could make a full screen teleport. You just have to time it right. Right click a building far away from the Arthas, click to move the screen to Arthas before Zeratul gets close to the building. As soon as Zeratul is in range and starts to jump into the building, you click on Arthas. And it teleports a whole screen away.  I don't think it was on purpose simply because it seems too hard to reproduce in the heat of the moment lol So it's more likely to have happened on accident. It wasn't even much necessary at that point in the game. The game was completely over by then."
heroesofthestorm,3dysue,vibrunazo,12,Mon Jul 20 20:53:17 2015 UTC,"In the video it looks like he postures back and forth, possibly from a minion or a wall/tower and then is immediately on Sylvanas. You would never use Shadow Assault that far away from anything. Definitively looks deliberate."

heroesofthestorm,3e2fdv,KomaEU,11,Tue Jul 21 13:02:50 2015 UTC,"You rotate away from the enemy's ball bouncing around, and do your best to gank the vikings, which post nerf isn't THAT hard. The goal is to force the vikings out of the two lanes where the other 4 aren't and just fall back when they start coming at you. It takes communication so good luck trying to beat it in QM, but it's doable."
heroesofthestorm,3e2fdv,F1reatwill88,2,Tue Jul 21 13:14:17 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the same advice could be given to anyone having trouble in a lane. Stay in range of xp if you can, but if you're having a hard time in lane just hang out by your towers. Especially true for heroes who are pretty weak until level 7 or so.  They're giving up presence in another lane to bully your single lane, while you're playing safe and wasting their time in your lane, your allies can be pushing and bullying the lanes they aren't in or have minimal presence."
heroesofthestorm,3e2fdv,That_otheraccount,7,Tue Jul 21 13:50:11 2015 UTC,The lanes where there is just one Viking should not fight the creeps at all. This way the minion waves will meet on the middle or push slightly to your side. This will make it much harder for the Vikings to soak safely so that you can zone them away from xp range or kill them.
heroesofthestorm,3e2fdv,Azphael,4,Tue Jul 21 13:19:55 2015 UTC,"The secret is to just run away. If a team of 4 is coming at you in one lane, that means you shouldn't be there. Fall back, mount up and go after the vikings in another lane. The pressure and XP that you can get from taking towers down in the other lanes will get you to 10 faster. Then you group and punish them for thinking that early kills mean much in this game.  The problem is that in QM people aren't comfortable with hearing ""Your enemy has destroyed a fort."" They will defend that digital tower to the last, even if they would be better served doing something else. Like  getting camps, capping map objectives or counter pushing in the other two lanes."
heroesofthestorm,3e2fdv,Fallout-82,2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:31 2015 UTC,"Don't go for greedy plays that will be punished. Force the enemy into investing too much effort and punish them. Force them into tower range, bait them into narrow spots to punish with AoE, extend fights by avoiding to fight them were you get initiated on and instead fight them on your terms.   In other MOBAs this style of aggressive play is usually punished by having the aggressive team fall behind on economy. Gank the Vikings to deny their progress. Also, dive is harder to counter since your teammate can't teleport to you if you get dived on under the tower, so make your best with smart rotations between lanes to foresee their attacks.  When it's objective time and the other team is obviously taking the fight there, leave the objective and take control of all 3 lanes or safe camps to deny their progress."
heroesofthestorm,3e2fdv,700b,2,Tue Jul 21 13:22:23 2015 UTC,"Leave whoever has the longest range to poke their 4 man from behind the wall and get minion xp (Jaina, Kael, Hammer, Valla). This person will eventually need to just abandon the lane entirely and let them 4v0 the fort. THIS IS OK.  ~  Put two in the other two lanes, focusing the vikings. You will out xp them, wether you kill Vikings, or just keep them away from dieing minions. You will probably take some towers too, as you are essentially 2v0 or 2v.5 in the Viking lanes. Don't worry if they take a fort in their 4 lane. Keeping Vikings out of lane and taking a few towers will put your team ahead on xp AND you have more POTENTIAL xp moving forward. (What I mean is that you will eventually get their forts if you have a level lead. No rush.)  ~  Drop back and defend 5v4 if they push to your second line of defense. You will win that team fight because of the level lead and the facts that it's 4v5, and also they have to run half the map to escape. If they are smart, they will switch to a second fort instead of pushing for the keep."
heroesofthestorm,3e2fdv,Pockner,2,Tue Jul 21 15:20:43 2015 UTC,"There is a reason why the Vikings are so loved on the pro level.   Advice that I was given is to play defensively till 10. Once the soaking phase ends the Vikings lose their initial value.  So in short, you'll probably ""lose"" the first half, but you can make a comeback in the mid to late game."
heroesofthestorm,3e2fdv,RollFirstMathLater,2,Tue Jul 21 13:11:01 2015 UTC,Problem with this is that the Vikings can still be useful as a group up 2 or even alone while 1 soaks.

heroesofthestorm,3e2fdv,Seriously_nopenope,0,Tue Jul 21 17:53:48 2015 UTC,Kill the Vikings so they aren't soaking
heroesofthestorm,3e2fdv,All_Milk_Diet,0,Tue Jul 21 15:05:00 2015 UTC,"If they use vikings to soak while other 4 are ""ganking"" lol just sit in lane and soak exp defensively. Whats the problem? They can't kill you if you just sit under towers and soak exp. Keep track of enemy movements and react accordingly when they come. If they stick to one lane for too long move your rotating duo to another lane and kill a viking. When this 4man deathball goes for objective - just kill all vikings and push.  If they use vikings to soak 2 lanes and push 3rd one - then just kill vikings and deny their exp doak."

heroesofthestorm,3e338m,HarrekMistpaw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:13 2015 UTC,"This by far. Using these heroes will allow you to climb as they are the best solo supports. I would say some of those heroes fair better vs other heroes, so maybe look up some guides on them to see who they are strong against vs who they are weak against.  If another person on your team is set on supporting and you still want to fill a utility role, think of going Tyrael, Anub, Tyrande, or Tassadar. They are more that hybrid role of support/utility and warrior/utility."
heroesofthestorm,3e338m,kowzzzz,2,Tue Jul 21 17:02:37 2015 UTC,"I dedicated myself to play warrior, and I bought almost all except Chen (no gold atm cause want to buy Leoric), and E.T.C. cause I don't like him at all. Mostly playing Anub'arak, Johanna, and Tyrael. So 1 initiator, 1 tank and 1 bruiser.   I know you as a support have smaller pool of heroes but i recommend the same, play all supports and play them well, then master your favorite/s. :)   Plus, when you make such dedication it's cool to have many heroes from your class of choice because of patches, meta and talent changes. ;)"
heroesofthestorm,3e338m,budas,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:16 2015 UTC,"Malf is the easiest good support to play well imo. I'd focus some time there. Lili will get hated on, but she's quite good at low/mid ranks and very easy to play (and cheap!). From there you can spend time on Uther or Reghar. I think Uther is overall the best (but not in every comp) and also the most difficult support to play.   If you plan to support a lot, then just learn all 4. If you plan to have 2 supports to play in HL when you need to, then go Malf and any of the other 3 (don't do Brightwing)."
heroesofthestorm,3e338m,jasonlillis22,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:44 2015 UTC,"If my team is full of mana users, I like to use Malf with some added mana regen talents. Makes a huge difference early on.

heroesofthestorm,3e338m,dampowell,2,Tue Jul 21 16:29:22 2015 UTC,It depends on enemy team comps but knowing when to land stuns and on who to land them on as well as when to use triple stun uther versus divine shield uther is probably your most important things to learn. Uther can soak a bit of damage but it's generally not recommended unless you are soaking damage to ensure your team wins a team fight

heroesofthestorm,3e2qx2,four2thefloor,2,Tue Jul 21 15:32:17 2015 UTC,God dammit.
heroesofthestorm,3e2qx2,omgitsjavi,7,Tue Jul 21 17:33:28 2015 UTC,"Apologies if this is covered, I didn't read all the replies.  Wormhole lets you Blink into a fight, drop some damage, and escape out very quickly. That's the gist. Yes, you have a limited time and cannot drop your entire load of damage, but that's ok. If you stayed long enough to drop your load of damage, you're likely dead anyway.  1- Approach the enemy team from behind if possible. Their eyes and mouse cursors will be forward to the heart of the team fight, their squishier or hurt targets are near the back, and you will avoid all the skillshots and AOE damage that will reveal you in the heart of the team fight.  2- Blink in, near the fight, but not exactly on your target. You want to walk a step or two after the Blink. This way when you return to your Blink spot using Wormhole, you're a little bit futher away out of sight into the fog of war.  3- If you're taking Follow Through (which you should), you should Blink-step-Auto Attack-Cleave-Auto Attack, and think about Blinking away with Wormhole, and immediately mount up after you do Blink out. (Note, you should also dismount a little earlier, don't Blink into a fight out of mount, this way your mount cooldown will be ready for the full escape.)  Your goal is to poke the enemy squishies. Not necessarily to kill them, but to start disrupting their team fight ability. Get them to pay attention to you and not your own damage dealers. You can chunk a very good portion of a squishy's health almost immediately, which will either cause them to retreat or their healer to spend their abilities. Either way, you're buying your team a window to swing the fight in your favor.  Your secondary goal is to finish off hurt squishies. Honestly, this is extremely important that you finish people up when they start to retreat or are out of position. But usually you need to start out with a poke round or two before you can move into FINISH THEM mode.  For practice, just try to go in with a Blink, AA, Cleave, and Wormhole out. This gets you used to the in-and-out fighting style, and gives you experience on what you can do and how much damage you can do in that short time period. As you get comfortable, you can start teasing the limit of your Wormhole timer with more actions. You'll also figure out against which opponents you can stay longer. For instance, if you Blink in against an Uther, you can't do much as a good Uther will save his stun especially for you. Which means you need to get in and out as fast as possible.  Yes, there are plenty times when you can just cloak-walk into the fight and just use Blink to escape, and maybe Wormhole to get back in if it means the team fight is going to be over. Especially true if you approach from the back or sides. If you favor this method, then skip Wormhole and pick up another talent. It's quite viable and a nice way to change things up. Walk into fights, save Blink as your escape.  Advanced: When you Blink into a fight, try to immediately point yourself in a different direction while still taking a step towards your target. This way it's harder to tell from which direction you Blinked in from. It's hard, and you end up doing quite a bit of mental geometry to make sure you Blink in a different spot from the most direct line... Either way, it's always awesome when the enemy has zero idea where you came from and where you went with Wormhole. Less awesome, when you give it away with the initial step."

heroesofthestorm,3e2qx2,keen36,4,Tue Jul 21 18:38:04 2015 UTC,"Zeratul is a coup-de-grace hero: you are not supposed to solo Jaina, Kael or other heroes. Alone you can only spread some damage, as you said, but you shouldn't play solo. You should join every allied figthing an enemy. You blink in, kill the most wounded enemy hero, blink away. Sometimes you wait until you know that you can oneshot the enemy. Wormhole is also useful to chase a running away enemy hero, or sometimes to save yourself, when the first blink is not enough (heroes chasing you with abilities, and after lvl 20 a lot of enemies will have blink)."
heroesofthestorm,3e2qx2,Nemek,2,Tue Jul 21 14:58:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert by any means but my Zera is level 12 so I'll try and help.  1) When you'll start to play against more experienced players you will see that it's really not that easy to just walk up to them to do your damage even if your stealthed, they will see you and break you out of cloak.  2) When you have wormhole and you blink into a fight, good players will usually take a step or two forward after blinking and before doing their combo. This makes it so when you blink back out, you will cover a larger distance than the actual blink range (like sylvanas' haunting wave). This puts you further away from the enemies you just hit and it makes it much harder for them to try and chase you.   3) One of the best use of wormhole is to allow you to go over obstacles and then back out. For instance if the enemies are on the other side of a wall, you call blink there, do your damage and then wormhole back on the other side of the wall where you're completely safe.  4) It also allows you to do some jukes. Like if you're being chased you can blink and let them follow you for a couple seconds and then wormhole back to your starting position.  Wormhole is by no means an easy skill to master, I'm still learning it myself, but it allows you to do so much things when you get good with it. (Like blinking on the other side of that wall to kill Abathur and then leave :P)."
heroesofthestorm,3e2qx2,Husskies,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:40 2015 UTC,"Why blink into the back line when I can just walk up, stealthed, and blink out?   Walking in is riskier and will force you to blink out when caught (or die if you get CC locked), but is ideal if possible.   What key combos do I need to pull off in those few seconds before Wormhole expires?   With Focused/FollowThrough/Double Bomb: Blink>Auto>Cleave>Auto>Bomb>Auto>Bomb>Auto   Can I reasonably be expected to burst down a Kael or Jaina to death within the Wormhole period?   Its doable if they don't have backup, but if they are alone you shouldn't need to blink on them to begin with.  Wormhole harass doesn't usually get a kill solo, but it forces big heals out or gives your team a window to pounce on someone you just took down to 15% HP.  Save this skill for when both teams are posturing 5v5 without committing or you're trying to defend a push. A good run-up-flank is always preferable to a blink in if your team is starting the fight."

heroesofthestorm,3e2qx2,DingDongDaddio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can't fit the whole thing in there, but it's ideal. But you gotta toss some autos in as frequently as possible.

heroesofthestorm,3e2qx2,Flarn84,2,Tue Jul 21 15:11:37 2015 UTC,I usually go for the noobier build with rending cleave instead of double bomb: blink>auto>bomb>auto>cleave>auto>blink

heroesofthestorm,3e2qx2,monning,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:43:12 2015 UTC,"Think of wormhole's advantages like this - You can blink in, walk a few steps and then blink waaaay far back out when you need to. This basically guarantees you don't get chased. In addition to that - you can safely blink over walls and into dangerous areas and still have your escape.  Wormhole provides poke potential and sustain potential, not necessarily gank potential."

heroesofthestorm,3e2qx2,NotGouv,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:11 2015 UTC,As already said in other comments you can't always walk up to your enemies safely. Wormhole allows Zeratul to scout and poke before big fights. It gets rather easy to spot a cloaked enemy running near you with experience but when he jumps at you from the fog of war it's always very hard.  If you want to poke you should just be looking to QW+auto before taking your wormhole back because enemies will focus you quickly. If the fight has already been initiated and enemies have blown some CC then you can go for longer combos.  Do not underestimate how powerful your Void Prison is. If you jump into a fight and manage to land a good Void Prison on 2 other enemies the fight basically becomes a 5v2 with easy cleanup for your team. You don't always have to take your hole back
heroesofthestorm,3e2qx2,BababooeyHotS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:39:33 2015 UTC,"You should use your wormhole to get in and poke, it removes their ability to spot the ""shimmer"" from you being in stealth.  When you use it, jump in from away from your team and w auto Q auto and blink back out.  You offer huge poke with it and most of the time it will be quick enough they can't lock you down.  Zeratul will win most one on one fights, but where he really shines is his ability to do high burst quickly and safely.  The other great use is while fighting if someone is solo you can blink away, VP their support and then come back to finish them."
heroesofthestorm,3e2qx2,rrrrupp,0,Tue Jul 21 16:01:31 2015 UTC,"In addition to what others have said, Wormhole gives you more damage due to follow-through. Blink in, Auto, cleave, auto, blink out is my poke move. It's okay if you don't kill someone. That will cripple them before they can react."

For e.g on TSQ in either lanes u can blink between the walls into top/bot lanes and safely hearth back if u get team wiped.  Depends if u took a second to walk a few steps to engage. If u took the usual AA build with Focused attack/Follow through and Double bombs it will look like Cleave > AA > Spike > AA > Spike > AA. If u blink in then start AA first.  From 100%-0%?

When a game would be found it would essentially be locked up though if it was on the blocked server. You could then force close and try searching again though it was just a huge pain in the ass.  Someone also claimed that Blizzard banned them for cheating for this though I never checked back in on the thread to see if it was in error due to the recent hardware false flags.

He isn't viable at top tier, i.e. competitive level, because he is easily countered by good, well-organized teams.  In any regular HL / QM, however, he continues to be one of the top picks and he's the best solo queue hero by a long shot as he can reliably cover two roles (Assassin / Specialist). What he needs is a buff to March of the Murlocks and afterwards, you're looking at one of the best-balanced heroes in HotS."

Tassadar has a single, three-pointed crest, with expressive blue eyes, and a kindly soft grey mottle color. His cheeks are narrow, and he has a rounded, sagely, brown brow.  Zeratul has a single-pointed double crest, and blazing green eyes. His brow is sharp and pronounced, and his cheeks are wider (though not as wide as a young Artanis). His skin is a single shade of purple-grey.   EDIT I meant to reply to /u/Jalapeno_Business, but I guess you get my feigned outrage instead. Enjoy."

If it were just ""Lost Vikings"", it'd sound like an unremarkable group of lost Vikings. When it's ""THE Lost Vikings"", it's clear that this is the name of this specific trio.  You're right though, there's no reason they couldn't ignore ""The"" prefixes when sorting, in the same way we often do for band names and book titles."

heroesofthestorm,3dxzdf,pshendry,-6,Mon Jul 20 20:13:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's stupid, but that's language.   The idea is that because some characters' names are also common nouns, they add the definite article to make it clear that it's ""not just any butcher! It's THE Butcher!"". It's isolating this particular butcher from every other butcher ever.   It's ridiculous, because we all know which butcher we're referring to and who the lost vikings are, but it's the same way in spoken language. You talk about ""the butcher"", but you don't usually say ""the Tyrande"" or ""the Jaina""."
heroesofthestorm,3dxzdf,glemnar,13,Mon Jul 20 14:41:31 2015 UTC,"Libraries are well-aware of how language works but that doesn't stop them from handling ""The"" specially when it comes to sorting, for practical reasons.

heroesofthestorm,3dxzdf,sumelar,-5,Mon Jul 20 18:03:39 2015 UTC,"my problem is I came from Dota, and ""The Butcher"" there is the alternate name for Pudge, who is the hero that Stitches was modeled after (Meat Hook, Vile Gas and Gorge are all taken from Pudge design and then modified to fit HotS balance).  So sometimes when people say ""Butcher"" or ""The Butcher"" I have a split second of, ""umm, there is no pudge in this game"" and then i remember there are two butcher heroes but one is called Stitches.  P.S. Yes i Played Diablo 1, 2 3 and WoW Naxx so i realize that ""Stitches"" is a WoW character and the Butcher is a Diabo character. But like i said, i came from DotA and their ""Butcher"" Pudge, who had Stitches Model and skills even said ""MMMmmmm Fresh Meat!"" when he Devoured (Gorged) someone."

The ""specialist group"" is a really nice addition overall, giving the game a quirky feel. Like, the first time I played Sylvanas, I was just in awe at the fact that she can just shut towers down like it was nothing. Granted, you can only really have that because objectives are so important, but I like how the game feels because of it all combined."
heroesofthestorm,3dzgxv,Kyvia,14,Mon Jul 20 21:04:16 2015 UTC,"I feel like Blizzard's... almost their total arrogance has helped them a lot here.  Ultimately they did actually make the first game with this QWER hero running around doing stuff game: it's just the DotA map makers who cut all the RTS stuff and built upon it.  After lots of DotA clones are already out, Blizzard suddenly turns up saying ""You think you invented DotA?  We fucking invented DotA.""  They just go and make their own DotA clone: but they actually genuinely improve it.  Couldn't get into LoL or Dota 2.  Loved Heroes from day 1."

heroesofthestorm,3dzgxv,Vindicare605,8,Mon Jul 20 21:12:48 2015 UTC,I have a similar feeling whenever I play Sergeant Hammer. You simply cannot leave her alone in a lane or she will wipe out your base all by herself.

heroesofthestorm,3dzgxv,xnerdyxrealistx,10,Tue Jul 21 08:33:24 2015 UTC,"Such a different opinion. I played Abathur for some time and while I did decently with it, I hated every minute of playing."
heroesofthestorm,3dzgxv,eur3ka676,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:47:46 2015 UTC,"Was your team just frustrating you? Because Abathur definitely can make you feel more frustrated by a bad team since you're seeing everything they're doing and just watching the whole map constantly. That's what I like about playing Abathur, though. I like the global presence of moving all around the map and paying attention to where everyone is at all times."
heroesofthestorm,3dzgxv,xnerdyxrealistx,2,Mon Jul 20 21:56:40 2015 UTC,"I'm currently in Bronze - new to MOBA/Online Games (was a campaign strategy and JPRG gamer) - and what I've noticed with Abathur is that you're entirely dependent on the abilities of the other 4.  90% in team fights its a 4.5 v 5 where Abathur could help turn the tide on the right Hero being played well (generally an auto attack or melee Hero).  Otherwise the other times you're putting your Q on towers/keeps/core 50% of the time because its just one of those games.  For a former strategy player, I found the whole global awareness and grand strategy part of the game to be the best part of Abathur.  A good Abathur should help shot call because you're able to be aware of far more things than most because your entire play style is generally dependent on maximizing the talents of others.  Also, I never go locus push build at the quick match mrr i'm playing.  Edit: coolest moment as abathur was putting the hat on a 3% health illidan as he ran towards base in lane being chased by 2.  Managed to shield  him in time to keep him alive."
heroesofthestorm,3dzgxv,eur3ka676,0,Mon Jul 20 22:34:34 2015 UTC,"Those are all good reasons why people don't like when an Abathur is picked early in Hero League. He NEEDS the right team composition to be a good team contributor, as you said. You need a good auto attack build character on the team.  That being said, I have fun playing as Abathur either way. He's always my choice for a change of pace character when playing the other roles gets boring."
heroesofthestorm,3dzgxv,grio,0,Mon Jul 20 22:37:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah. First/Second pick HL Abathur is a major facepalm as roving burst assassins are more valuable (Zera/Nova) as taking you out makes it a 4v5 everytime.  I've been solo Q-ing Abathur in QM since i got him recently and it has actually taught me to be more Zen.  Where my MMR/matched played in QM is, i'm matched often with Lvl 20-25s who are trying out the rotation of the week heroes.  So its understandable if team comp is crap, but the real sin becomes people who give up/don't try to improve after every death.  I'm level 40 and have a good friend whose 3k+ MMR in QM with 11k games played and have been studying up to get better.  Working on QM MMR until I'm comfortable enough to enter HL.  Rather not flameout."

heroesofthestorm,3dzgxv,EliteCorps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:57:09 2015 UTC,"Any time I get a really bad comp in QM I go locust + Split push build.  Siege locusts, locust spawn, network carapace AND Carapace stays when you leave.  I don't get global mines, but I'm mobile enough and can split push well enough that I can ghetto backdoor if I want to.  What I tend to do early game is soak a lane and hop around network carapacing empty lanes (during objectives).  Generally I may be on a minion for enough time to get 2 stabs, 1 burst and 1 carapace out.  Then I hop to the next lane.  You'd be surprised how much build up of minions you can get with just networked carapaces protecting them.  I tend to get monstrosity and pop it when a lane is being pushed back, to give him time to build stacks.  Once I get to 16 I actually also start soloing siege camps with my bombard locusts, which surprises a lot of people.  I also will tunnel to a forward lane, drop my locusts, shield them and hearth back.  A LOT of split pushing with VERY little risk can be done by Abathur.  This doesn't work AT ALL on tomb of the spider queen or dragon shrine (when people don't have to leave lanes to do objective) and isn't that great on Haunted Mines.  It's amazing on Cursed Hollow and pretty good on BoE and Garden of Terror.  Haven't done it on BHB but people are MIA from lanes so frequently that it should work there too.  Today on Garden of Terror, I pretty much split pushed 2 lanes to the keep's towers before we got our first Terror (Because we were all terrible).  Managed to win it just because split pushing made people leave lanes, allowing my grouped allies to mow through them.  Won't work in HL at all, but so fun in the mess that is QM."
heroesofthestorm,3dzgxv,mirithil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:35:14 2015 UTC,I feel the same about murky but i love abathur. It's just a matter of preference.
heroesofthestorm,3dzgxv,ultimateballoon,2,Tue Jul 21 07:53:08 2015 UTC,"As someone said elsewhere, Abathur enhances the quality of the team, be it negative or positive. A good Aba with 4 more good players is unstoppable, a good Aba with bad teammates will underperform."
heroesofthestorm,3dzgxv,MilkRain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:35:33 2015 UTC,"I got him and Murky a couple of weeks ago and they're quickly climbing to become my favorites.  Taking a monstrosity and building up a huge minion wave of like 30 & a bruiser camp I've pushed right to the core and won, dug into the enemy base and baited the enemy into chasing me while our catapults finish off the core or doing an ultimate evolution on Zeratul and just going ham in their base. So satisfying.  I think I've learned the most from Abathur about other heroes because you can see when your team makes mistakes, things you don't really get to see when you're trying to adjust your own positioning. Illogical decision. Do not replicate."

heroesofthestorm,3dzgxv,ETisME,2,Tue Jul 21 08:24:07 2015 UTC,"I was a long time RTS player, mostly SC/W3. So macro, map awareness etc are not that hard for me. With that in belt, I eagerly purchased him as my first hero.. only to find out he isnt as good as I expected. Here are my reasons:   His hat feels so weak. A shield, an AOE and a skill shot... all add a little bit ... Yes, It can be noticable in 1v1, other than that I feels the hat is so meh.. Idk what I'm contributing for team fight with that hat.. Lack of CC: Abby can spec into some slow but that's all (maybe im wrong?) His W is for sight control, but its kinda weird. I've watched plenty of good abby players, they could place that little thing on right places at right time, and Its kinda cool; but I dont get the design intention behind it. And again, it feels weak. I know sight could win you a game, but the feeling of droppin a weird organic and wait for ppl go on it.. His ultimate Its what I love. Mostly I go for the clone one. I could clone any hero and ""play like a boss"" haha... The only thing make me feel the FUN playing Abby. Sneaky go in and out of the battlefield to soak XP: yes, its fun and challengin, especially when the enemy team has good NOva/Zera. ITs like a mini game between me and those lurkers. The problem is maphacking has haunted my mind set when, suddenly, a very bad Nova drops her strike on me afar..   I dont say Abby is weak or UP. Hes very unique and cool. But I dont find it fun playin him. Hope some1 could guide me!"
heroesofthestorm,3dzgxv,GnRxSlash,0,Tue Jul 21 03:59:01 2015 UTC,"His q is really useful and can be game changing because not only you can help out heroes globally, you can also use it to push lane. It is especially good on some heroes such as melee.  The w on the other hand I personally am liking more and more. The power is that you can significantly help your team spot roaming enemies and is extremely useful for objective control (combining with q)  You can also choose to go for locust build focusing on split push. It really helps your team by putting pressure on all lanes (locust and q on other lanes).  I think you will also like lost vikings. It's the most multi task heavy hero."
heroesofthestorm,3dzgxv,ETisME,2,Tue Jul 21 04:07:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for you reply. I somewhat know your opinions, but I havent yet fully understood that. Maybe some in-depth guides and hours of researchin could take me off.  I tried TLV during their free rotation, and yeah, while the multi tasking keep me busy all match, but again, my point is, the FUN. I seek for the fun factor the most. TLV for me like a gang of little rats, go around, sneak in brush and ""steal"" XP. In teamfight, they only shine with their boat heroic, but after that.. The main point playing TLV is for the early XP advantage, but.. isnt enough. Is me so Nazi? About multi taskin, I prefer Chen Triple Attack more than TLV. Buttf them, like a boss. Haha.  I find myself enjoy playing Zeratul. I play him as a scout, map control and fk ppl in their butt when they least expect... Im saving for Murky and Nova currently for that.  Back to Abby. I think hes only shine when u get a good comp, or at least having a friend playin with, and voice chat is required. Abby has a good balance mix of global presence, multi tasking and macroin from TLV, stealthed, BW... and it is very outstanding only when ppl know how to coop."
heroesofthestorm,3dzgxv,mertcan1k2,-13,Tue Jul 21 04:31:39 2015 UTC,"I think you will get why abathur is so good when you actually have a good one on the team.   About the lost vikings, it's build is really flexible. On the eternal conflict map for example, you can have the blue tank to go with your team for the immortals and the other two split up for each lane. And I would get quick restart (2nd r just in case I got the name wrong) and it is endless pushing and helping the team out everywhere.  But yeah, everyone has their own fav hero, I totally don't get Zeratul haha"

People buy a $10 digital book to support the tournament, and for each purchase 1/4 of that($2.5) goes to the tournament..  So by raising the prizepool to about $17m, valve effectively made upwards of $40m..  they'll probably make even more near the end of the international cuz of the secret shop merchandise which is almost always sold out every year..  And i dont know how Dota's production value ""laughable""   production value: the technical elements of a production, as the lighting, décor, or sound in a film, often, specif., such elements that are enhanced to increase audience appeal   If you look at the lighting and sound pretty sure TI4's was better..

heroesofthestorm,3dz8y6,Bjbyshgya,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:51:27 2015 UTC,"So for a LoL starting player that's 50k per year (4 splits)   From your link, page 5 of the LCS Rule Set:   The 2015 Season of the LCS will be divided into two halves (""splits”).   It's 25k/year, which is slightly better than minimum wage if you do a 40 hour week. We all know that they are not calling it a day at 40 hours, so it's about on par with minimum wage, and it gets worse the more you play. In the vast majority of situations:   Teams are making the sponsor money, not players.  Teams are making the merchandising money, not players.  Teams are making the shit advertising money from their websites, not players. Players get their twitch streaming money where there is no contrary agreement with their team. But you don't need a team to stream and it's a small amount of money regardless.   To top it off, being an eSports professional virtually forecloses all of the social and educational opportunities for a young adult. You sit in a room all day staring at a screen, while your peers are going to college, working less for better pay, and generally having a social life. Not to mention your eSports resume is relatively worthless in the real world.  That being said, things are better than they were 10 years ago, but it's not a career. I'd take waiting tables, going to college, and playing games for fun over an eSports ""job.""

If you own your own business that DOES eSports things (i.e., a team, a news website, etc.) you can put that on your resume and it will reflect well.  Someone who owns their own business related to video games looks a lot better than someone who plays video games as a job."

The largest LoL pot was the 2014 championships at just a little over 2 million. TI5 by itself is on pace for at least 18 million. Also they are adding seasonal tournaments in the same vein as TI throughout the year now."

heroesofthestorm,3dz8y6,ConnorMc1eod,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:55:15 2015 UTC,"You could say that, but as someone said earlier the salary from Riot was 50k a year. So in Dota, if you've played in the TI, and you've been consistent in tournaments throughout the year to be invited and not even have to quality, as of right now you get 51k guaranteed just for showing up.   Each system has it's pros and cons. I would imagine from a pro team standpoint that does well in majority of it's tournaments they enter, the yearly salary probably doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of things, cause they would likely earn more than that from the tournaments."

heroesofthestorm,3dz8y6,cglo,2,Mon Jul 20 20:22:09 2015 UTC,The point is that they don't make any money. All pro players ever talk about is how they're barely scraping enough money to survive and they live off of cardboard ramen and hot pockets. You only make a ton of money if you're a huge celebrity in a game like league or dota where the prize pools are insane since about 75%+ of that tournament money goes to your contracting company.

heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,Dstarisameanie,20,Mon Jul 20 21:55:28 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't see how Unstable Anomaly is good at all. She isn't a hero focused on damage, and the ability barely tickles anyways. If you get it to AoE, it's a tiny bit of damage, but it's still pretty useless. If an enemy is being bursted down, is polymorphed, and gets away with a sliver of health... well, they shouldn't. The utility of Peekaboo or Manic Pixie almost always outshadows it. I daresay you should instead take the range on Arcane Flare if you're that worried about finishing people off. Also, sure, Manic Pixie is absolutely TRASH, but it's not like Brightwing has a choice and it basically doubles Soothing Mist's healing on one target (which is more than a 25% increase on Lightning Shielded allies, btw :P)   Bouncy dust is the most 'often” picked talent in this tier(According to HoTS logs) and all it does is create a mathematical mess for you utilize the other pixie talents.   Bouncy Dust isn't that hard to use, and it is incredibly useful in a meta where Jaina and Kael'thas are often first picked and highly valued. If you're fast enough, you can change that Flamestrike that is about to hit two people and kill them to do basically nothing, and then your Manic Pixie procs and heals them up. It isn't trash at all, it's just meant to be used quickly as a snap reaction to save allies from things like Blizzards, Cone of Colds, and Flamestrikes. It's only useful if you take Shield Dust, but it saves lives, and having the ability to proc the same ability twice with no extra cooldown is huge. You're already taking Shield Dust on level 13. It's not like you have to invest much more into this talent.  You LITERALLY say why Bouncy Dust is good as a lvl 16 talent right here--   hit another ally with spell shield, repeating the damage reduction   -- as a selling point to use Rewind. Sure, Rewind's utility might be that you can use ALL of your abilities twice, but that just means Brightwing can now use Shield Dust -4- times in a short period of time. That's huge.   You have to wait ten seconds to then do something, that kind-of helps do something else, a little.   The Pixie Dust build is literally the same build as yours except for the lvl 16 talent... I don't see how this is really an issue.   As for Hardened focus, frankly, if you're above eighty-percent health through most fights, than you weren't aggressive enough. Sticking around thirty to forty percent is usually the sweet spot of Brightwing support.   First of all, with that build, sure, you NEVER go Hardened Focus. It's not a good talent-- if you want your Pixie Dust to come up faster, take the talent that doubles its effect. But you should never be so aggressive with Brightwing that you are always 30% to 40% health. That doesn't mean you're being aggressive, it means you're taking unnecessary damage and repeatedly jumping into the frontline on a hero that can just use ranged abilities. A single Kael'thas Flamestrike, a Jaina Blizzard (two waves), or a Zeratul Cleave-AA would finish you off. You're a healer that passively heals herself for no cooldown or mana cost. You should be at 80% or more at all times if you utilize your blink correctly to avoid damage. On no hero should you be able to say ""If you're always low health, you're doing it right"".  The reason Hardened Focus is viable is because of the Mistified build, where you focus purely on Soothing Mist. It doubles your healing output and it is considered the only talent tier that you CAN'T deviate from if you take Soothing Mist build.   Other than that, Greater Polymorph and Critterize are great. The only time I'd recommend taking Bouncy Dust is against spellcasters-- which, coincidentally, are the most prevalent in this meta. Against AAers, Greater Poly/Critterize are far, far better.  This appears to be a solid build. I'm not knocking the build but there are certain things here that just don't make sense, not to mention    I see the random things posted by the various websites that carry HoTS guides.   Seeing as I have the only highly-rated Brightwing build that is post-nerf on heroesfire, I felt like I should respond to that. Our builds are literally the same. Mine has the deviation in Manic Pixie/Peekaboo, because of reasons I already mentioned. I put lvl 16 as a situational tier which depends on the enemy team's comp, so I count that as having the same talent choices."
heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,Indarus1,2,Tue Jul 21 00:08:38 2015 UTC,I've been taking Peakaboo quite a bit now with all the stealth players I'm facing and on Battlefield of Eternity. That vision is a rather nice touch.
heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,440Music,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:07:19 2015 UTC,"So, first I didn't mean to offend you with the 'random things' comment. It was genuinely not a slight against you, nor was it a slight against people who play that build, or other builds like it from any website. So please, allow an apology if I did offend you. I just don't think it carries the optimal synergy for Brightwing play. Which I think, is focused on Poly.  the only other comment I wanted to say to retort is that I think Brightwing and most healers need to be aggressive to keep up with your DPS. Sure when you have a perfect formation five-man group, you want to keep in the middle or back-line of the team fight, but in those kinds of groups you probably wouldn't pick Brightwing anyways. Not competitively, really.  Either way, it's good to hear different opinions. I could always be wrong, but this build definitely has the best results for me."
heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,Indarus1,10,Tue Jul 21 00:52:42 2015 UTC,"I just don't think it carries the optimal synergy for Brightwing play    But as I said, our builds are the EXACT same except for the lvl 4 talent. Level 16 is always a situational tier, and there is never a ""strict"" talent choice for it. Take Bouncy Dust when there's a Kael/Jaina, take Critterize if you have dive or burst damage, take Greater Polymorph if you have high priority targets on the enemy team, et cetera. And it kind of frustrates me, because most of the people who look at my guide probably just look at the talent choices and think ""OKAY, this is the strict build!"". It isn't. In many situations, Greater Poly/Critterize is better, but Bouncy Dust is best for the two most powerful assassins in the meta right now. I don't see how the builds have a different focus, because the only variation is at lvl 4 where you take (imo) a very lackluster and objectively bad (having more vision as a utility support or double healing is always good, there is no reason to finish off a target with polymorph when you have more than one damage dealer and an ability that innately does the same damage as the exploding polymorph) talent.  While I do agree that supports can be aggressive, they shouldn't be so aggressive that they're tanking most of the damage for the team. Most of the time you can end up dipping out without losing too much health when it's unsafe and still stay above 80% health. Not to mention that the Soothing Mist build plays completely differently."
heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,lmcphers,8,Tue Jul 21 01:24:15 2015 UTC,"I do agree with you that the Pixie Dust talents are underwhelming, particularly because the duration of Pixie Dust doesn't warrant picking any of them.  If Pixie Dust was weaker and lasted longer, then maybe it would be good, but that is not the case.  Where I do question some of your decisions is choosing Critterize over Greater Polymorph.  Greater Polymorph is a 66% increase on the duration of Polymorph.  Critterize is great, don't get me wrong, but I believe it pales now in comparison to Greater Polymorph, especially since there are a lot of characters that do get picked that provide Vulnerability, a la Tyrande, Sylvanas, Nova, etc.  Additionally, and this might be different now that Brightwing's healing is a bit weaker thanks to talent reworks, but Emerald Wind is actually really powerful.  Even as a solo Brightwing healer from before, I used to take Emerald Wind over Blink Heal. Now it is harder to justify that, but it is an incredibly good ultimate.  It stuns enemies during the duration of the wind just for starters, can split up and disorient enemy teams, or peel for your carries on top of the things that you mentioned.  Just my two comments."
heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,dreamslave,4,Mon Jul 20 22:26:28 2015 UTC,"I'll have to give Greater some more attempts. I definitely recognize it's power. And it may be a ally team dependent thing. Like, maybe Critterize is more effective with nexus frenzy characters and Greater is better with burst allies like Kael/Jaina who are omnipresent right now.  As for Emerald wind. It may be my play style that makes it so ineffectual for me, but when I see it on the enemy team, PUG allies, or when I use it, it just never seems to add up. It was certainly better when Brightwing's passive healing was better, but even then, I still preferred Blink."
heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,DuckMeister1623,4,Mon Jul 20 22:35:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with your post. Greater Poly vs Critterize can be a bit situational. I usually decide based on team comp, mainly our damage dealers. I usually prefer critter for blowing someone up and the fact that it overlaps with Unstable's damage though.  Also yes! The thing I miss most about the current changes is it's harder to justify emerald wind without a solid second healer. I prevented so many team wipes prenerf or secured so many displacement kills with it. It's super powerful if one knows when to use it. With another of the true healers and their healing ult, emerald wind still has a place, but her healing numbers are far too low without blink healing as a solo support to justify it unfortunately.  The only problem is it no longer stuns, just dazes. Still, any still channels can still be interrupted easily by it, and I found the displacement mechanic far more valuable than the stun by far."
heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,lmcphers,3,Mon Jul 20 22:53:13 2015 UTC,"I'm actually a pretty big defender of Emerald Wind. If you're using it when your team is using Ultimates (this has happened to me) you're thinking about it wrong. It is great for stealing objectives, but it's also incredible for destroying the other team's positioning, or keeping your teammates alive for that second longer they needed to win the fight. Back when Brightwing was good (sorry, but they effectively destroyed her) I would go for Continuous Winds at 20 and it won me games countless times. I also like it because it's versatile enough to use it as an escape measure. I know Blink Heal is the same, but Blink Heal can't be used for much else than positioning. Winds gives you positioning, damage, boss stealing advantage and escape. But that's just my 2 cents. Y'all make good points too."
heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,DuckMeister1623,2,Tue Jul 21 12:01:55 2015 UTC,"The other big nerf to Emerald Wind was the removal of Sprint, which really reduced her ability to get perfect positioning for ults.  Unfortunately, just about every aspect of Brightwing except her utility (which she had enough from before) was hurt.  Instead, they made her a utility support that was lackluster everywhere else.  Even Tassadar is in a better position than her right now."
heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,Mekhazzio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:04 2015 UTC,Totally agree with you. It was downright unsportsmanlike for Blizzard to drop her that bad. I have wracked my brain for reasoning and all I can come up with is poor game direction/management.
heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,lmcphers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:53:53 2015 UTC,"I do agree with you that the Pixie Dust talents are underwhelming   Whaaat?  When you're always up against Jaina, Kael or both, I defy you to name a better support ability than talented Pixie Dust.  Softening & avoiding burst before it lands will always beat trying to heal up that burst after the fact.  Full-on Pixie is competitive with Storm Shield most of the time, IMO."
heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,Azphael,2,Tue Jul 21 01:30:32 2015 UTC,"The only talent that is good against those two is the spell shield Pixie Dust which is the only viable talent at that level, so it is included in my build.  The rest are lackluster."

heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,Secon2,4,Tue Jul 21 05:40:27 2015 UTC,"Another good instance to use Brightwing is when you have Stealth on the field. With Peekaboo at 7, she effectively takes Nova and Zeratul out of team fights later in the game.   I agree. BW is useful, just in certain situations.

heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,EnderCN,5,Tue Jul 21 00:40:11 2015 UTC,"As a Brightwing player, I disagree with your discussion on Manic Pixie at 4, SOMETIMES.   Assuming you build it in conjunction with Bouncy Dust and Shield Dust, Manic Pixie can pay off big time later on. For those Brightwing players who pick Mistified at level 7 instead of Phase Shield, this becomes a really big deal. Brightwing's trait heals for 36 (+9 per level), and Manic Pixie nearly doubles it, healing for an additional 30 (+10 per level). Once you pass level 6, Manic Pixie heals for more than the trait heal does itself.   36 + 9*6 = 90  30 + 10*6 = 90   In games against very bursty comps, a good Brightwing player with good track of the cooldown on her trait can really maximize this. I have healed circles around Malfurions, Uthers and Rehgars with a healing focused build. Right now, the game's natural meta is kind of focused on burst comps, which means supports need to be prepared to deal with burst damage. Brightwing isn't great at that, but she has enough utility in addition to her healing to still make her a viable support choice.  That said, this type of discussion in this thread is exactly the reason I think Brightwing is where Blizzard wants her to be now. She has a variety of talents that are each viable depending on the build."
heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,neers1985,4,Tue Jul 21 03:09:32 2015 UTC,"Holy cow, someone else uses my preferred Brightwing build post changes. I'm glad I'm not the only one that sees the poly/phase shift build as useful because most of the builds I see around focus on pixie dust. While I sometimes change up talents and builds based on team comps, this is my go to favorite build if there's another support and there's a bit more leeway on talent picks. So far it hasn't failed me. My only change is I always either get Revitalizing Mist or Storm Shield at 20 because it's just too useful to pass up for the healing part of things and I prefer a hybrid of the cc/healing. It's my only not so aggressive talent in my build."
heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,andraes,2,Mon Jul 20 22:21:04 2015 UTC,"Can't fault you for that. My numbers say I pick storm shield, something like, 45 percent of all games, and rewind only about 30 percent.  Whenever I try to Revitalizing, though, it also fails me. I feel like I die more when I pick it. Not literally, and not because of the talent's probably, but I just shy away from it now.  It's a lot easier to pick rewind if your team has a Malfurion or LI LI though."
heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,whev3,2,Mon Jul 20 22:32:04 2015 UTC,"Revitalizing only works really well unfortunately if your team is willing to stick together post 20 almost exclusively. Storm shield is similar, but if only half your team is there and you need it it's easier to pop on demand than it is for to have it proc on a few people and work well.   Ah! that may explain it a little too. I've been mostly being paired with Uther or Rehgar so I try to help with the area heals/sustain a bit more while they can provide the burst to keep me and those focused in the game. That could be the other thing. For Malfurion or Lili, the sustain is already there but the bursty stuff is what is lacking a little. I'll def consider rewind if it's Lili or Malf I'm with. Thanks! :D"
heroesofthestorm,3dzx4u,Werv,3,Mon Jul 20 22:36:47 2015 UTC,I feel you are just really undervaluing pixie dust personally.  I've found once I have bouncy dust and shield dust I almost never lose a team fight.  Add in the storm shield and games almost always seem to end very quickly with a win.  I think this is just one of those how you personally like to play type of things.  The entire point of the BW changes and all of the big hero revamps was to give more options in how to play a hero and BW actually has 3 or 4 builds you can play now.  People just saw that she was weaker than in the past and gave up on her right away instead of adapting to her.   She isn't great in the burst heavy meta but when the meta shifts back to less burst I'm sure she'll see competitive play again.

I think that yes, attitude is very important, because this game is a lot about teamplay, so if you have great chemistry, it's already a positive sign for your team.  But that's not everything either. I have a great friend with whom I play with, and, this might come off as an exaggeration (but I actually mean this), but said friend who is level 30ish and has great mechanics (because he came from LoL) is WORSE to play with than my brother who is merely level 15.  Why? Because my brother is a teamplayer and my friend isn't. So yes, the atmosphere is important, but it's also important to be a TEAMPLAYER. The ability to ""swallow your pride"" and go with the team even if you disagree with the decision is HUGE. That's something my brother is capable of and my friend is not, even though objectively, mechanically-speaking, my friend is better than my brother, but as a HoTS team-mate, my brother is much more valuable than him."

On a personal level I'm hoping for a breakthrough performance from at least one or two relatively unknown teams. Historically in our games Road to BlizzCon is the time when magic happens ;)  I also feel like this is a great opportunity for the aspiring teams to reach a solid result, win some prize money and get a boost in confidence, considering the rather flat payout structure."
heroesofthestorm,3dyrs9,ptbl,5,Mon Jul 20 17:33:54 2015 UTC,"The third qualifier conflicts with Master Gaming Arena at Pax Prime (50k prizepool). MGA will be the biggest Lan to this date that will feature the top teams from NA, EU, and Asia.  It sucks that two big tournaments are happening on the same days. MGA was announced months ahead of time. There is no reason why these two events should conflict with each other.  MGA is from August 28-31, and the third EU Open qualifier is from August 29-30.  Here's the link to MGA http://wiki.teamliquid.net/heroes/Masters_Gaming_Arena_2015."
heroesofthestorm,3dyrs9,Moonprayer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:21:17 2015 UTC,The reason is that Blizzard waited 2 months for the qualifier for no (at least for us viewer) reason.

heroesofthestorm,3dyrs9,CyaSteve,3,Mon Jul 20 20:39:21 2015 UTC,3rd qualifier is at the same days as MSI MGA. Don't know if that's really smart but maybe it won't matter because the 2 teams that play in MSI will probably qualify in the 1st / 2nd qualifier. But it was obvious that rushing out with the Road to Blizzcon dates and doing it THIS late will cause problems with other tournaments.

heroesofthestorm,3e308g,worldwithpyramids,18,Tue Jul 21 15:51:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly OP I have to disagree. Personally, when I queue into QM it's because I want to play competitively whilst being able to choose whatever hero I want (without sabotaging the team). In my opinion it's not the place to goof around, that's what VS AI is for. However, really there is no restriction on what you should do in QM, so one must realise that some people want to play seriously and the losses really do matter to them whilst others don't care so much. I see the situation like Hearthstone's casual mode, a lot of people get frustrated when other players play 'meta' decks in casual because ""that's what ranked is for"" when really it's a mode with no restrictions, so you're free to do what you want!"
heroesofthestorm,3e308g,Radiator_Lamp,4,Tue Jul 21 16:30:09 2015 UTC,when I queue into QM it's because I want to play competitively whilst being able to choose whatever hero I want (without sabotaging the team) Great point.
heroesofthestorm,3e308g,ndog14,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:05 2015 UTC,"This is me exactly. I have to admit I get a little exasperated when someone one my team is clearly doing nothing, I ask them to help with an objective and they reply with something along the lines of ""ITS ONLY QM NOOB LOL"""
heroesofthestorm,3e308g,an_angry_Moose,0,Tue Jul 21 17:15:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know about this.  I see where you're coming from, but VS AI is a fundamentally different experience than playing against humans. Trying out a build or getting to know a hero doesn't work against AI like it does against a human.  95% of the time the AI is awful and a well-coordinated team is going to blast the AI in a very quick game. Not much can be learned in those scenarios."
heroesofthestorm,3e308g,Exvaris,11,Tue Jul 21 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"I see the tiers as   AI - that's where you ""goof around"" with new builds, play styles, etc. It doesn't count for anything. Quick Match - competitive, you have specific characters you enjoy playing, and you want to play them without getting shouted at that ""You picked Zagara? You idiot, that's not the Meta!!!"" Hero League - uber-competitive, you want to show off how skilled you are, and you want to be ranked. You know a huge variety of characters, and enjoy both the Meta, and playing whatever ""hand you're given"" (ex. you have to play a support, because nobody in your draft chose one)   I tend to play QM, because I like being competitive, I like playing real people, but I don't want to be told ""Take a TANK, we need a tank!"" when I hate tanks, and can't play them."
heroesofthestorm,3e308g,redkatt,5,Tue Jul 21 16:18:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know about goofing around but IMO quick match is for build testing and to practice a hero that you want to use in HL/TL. Practicing against real people is a lot better than practicing with the AI.   I mean, my group was 5 stacking practicing our VP/Apoc combo and we accidentally queued into vs AI. We finished the game in under 10 minutes and just steamrolled them. We didn't learn anything new other than the AI is just as bad as someone who just started playing MOBA's"
heroesofthestorm,3e308g,ahmong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:56 2015 UTC,"I see AI as a place for new players or if you literally want to space out entirely while simultaneously doing something else. I don't think you can test new builds or heroes against AI with any sort of accuracy or fulfillment. It's just not the same.  I also don't really see how people can think of QM as ""competitive."" There's too much randomization with what heroes are on what team and all with no prior map knowledge. There's so much stuff up in the air that I feel like if you're playing it purely competitively and worrying about your win/loss ratio then you're setting yourself up for disappointment and frustration.   And, I sorta feel like a lot of people are misunderstanding my sentiment.  I'm not saying you can't try-hard in QM. If that's what you're into, fine. And I'm also not saying everyone should be okay with people trolling, playing recklessly or not trying in QM either. You can still play to win with lower tier heroes. I'm just saying that a lot of people play QM for a less meta influenced experience and those who are playing it with the meta in mind should not be harassing those who don't."
heroesofthestorm,3e308g,Hoagithor,3,Tue Jul 21 16:45:22 2015 UTC,"While testing things in AI isn't the same, its much better then playing your first game as a unique hero in QM. Nothing worse than a Tychus or Kerrigan message ""sorry guys, first game as X"" as they die 10 times. Its for seeing how things work, not necessarily how potent they are.  While i enjoy your relaxed notion, i think you're taking away the spirit of competition. I would call my self competitive in QM (all i play, 1500 games), but that doesn't mean i cry over losses and misplays. It just means i want a team to play the game with. Not jerk around with a hero they've never played, not ""lol idc what happens, i'm just doing quests"", not flame at each death like its GG, just play the game; with victory in mind."

This is especially hard for me when I'm a tank or support, because it feels like I should be the one saving their asses.          Li Li's ultimate and Li Li herself is all about positioning, and this allows you as a Li Li player to actually make those calls. Do we commit or run? Do we cut our losses or try to make it an even trade? With experience, you'll be able to make those decisions faster, but as with everything else in Heroes, you just need to decide and act on it.           I'm not a highly skilled player, but this is something I learned and am trying to get better at."

heroesofthestorm,3e2u9r,Einsame,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:56 2015 UTC,"I agree, though at a high level of play, many toons have one ult that is simply superior from a team synergy POV. Syl, LiLi, Rehgar, some would even argue KT and Jaina all have ults that are so often picked because they are ""better"" from a teamfight standpoint. At least until we (the community) find a better wombo combo involving Shadow Assault, for example."
heroesofthestorm,3e2u9r,JohnnyB_Goode,4,Tue Jul 21 16:19:18 2015 UTC,I don't think anything can be done to SA that would make it worth picking over current Void Prison. VP is simply way too poweful at the moment.
heroesofthestorm,3e2u9r,littlefran,2,Tue Jul 21 15:13:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is bad as much as VP is just way better, so trying to make any ult pickable over it would have to be pretty damn strong."

heroesofthestorm,3e2u9r,Slitted,2,Tue Jul 21 15:31:42 2015 UTC,You want to adopt Riot's strategy of balancing?
heroesofthestorm,3e2u9r,Tala28,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:57:27 2015 UTC,"To balance someone doesn't always mean nefing the hell out of them, balance means taking from one spot and adding to another where needed, so if that's riots strategy then yes adopt away. Just cause you invent something that's great doesn't mean it can't be better."
heroesofthestorm,3e2u9r,Torlen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"Zeratul is perfectly balanced as it is right now, just because an hero is good doesnt mean it's overpowered."
heroesofthestorm,3e2u9r,HarrekMistpaw,0,Tue Jul 21 16:20:24 2015 UTC,There is nothing wrong with zeratul. He's the counter to the kael/jaina meta right now which is why he's so strong. In Korea they run double or triple tank and he isn't picked as often.
heroesofthestorm,3e2u9r,Tala28,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:35:45 2015 UTC,"Getting rid of wormhole would just make the hero more frustrating to play, if you want nerfs they need to revert the follow through buff on him"
heroesofthestorm,3e2u9r,HarrekMistpaw,2,Tue Jul 21 15:47:16 2015 UTC,"Zeratul damage is perfectly fine right now, he can remove half of your health with one go so what?, nova can remove 100% of your health in 1 second, zeratul has half of her damage but more safety in return, and his combo needs a whole 10 secs cd to work again, the only thing that is debetable about his kit is VP."
heroesofthestorm,3e2u9r,Tala28,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:23:03 2015 UTC,"make him more frusturating, why because he doesnt have a free escape to poke? he does fine before wormhole talent, i dont see why he needs it, leaves very little counter play, now you may be right about not totally removing teh talent, but giving it a 1.5 second delay or longer should definitely be added to balance it."
heroesofthestorm,3e2u9r,orcusgg,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:49:16 2015 UTC,"he does fine before wormhole talent, i dont see why he needs it   His playstyle changes a lot once you get wormhole, it makes playing him more safe and gives him the ability to poke which is unique to him out of all the melee assassins, taking it away would mean tunneling the way he is played and making it more frustrating for the average player  He was balanced a while ago while still having wormhole, that talent is not the problem"
heroesofthestorm,3e2u9r,HarrekMistpaw,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:57:11 2015 UTC,"He's assassin that can take out half your health and get out no problem safe and sound, I understand if you like playing zeratul but to say that giving him the ability to go into a fight blow half you health away (relative to most supports and assassins) and get out safe and sound its not balanced."
heroesofthestorm,3e2u9r,Tala28,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:13:48 2015 UTC,"there are dozens of heroes that have abilities that CC. even a small stun lock is enough to make a dead zeratul.  There is plenty of counter play to wormhole that makes it balanced. In the current meta of squishy burst mages, yeah he seems over powered. Guess what though? Zeratul seemed pretty overpowered during the wombo combo meta as well, when the meta shifted, we began to see less and less of him. If/when the meta shifts again, i guarantee zeratul will not be played nearly as much."

heroesofthestorm,3e1rb8,dubadudu,6,Tue Jul 21 07:59:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I hope this doesn't come across the wrong way, but I don't think you've even begun to really get into it.  I mean sure you come from LoL (I come from there too) so you've got the mechanics side of the game covered. And yes, objectives and merc camps are important.  But the thing here is that, unlike other MoBAs, teamplay is PARAMOUNT. Yes, it's also important in other MoBAs, but here, no matter how good you are, no matter how good you think are or ever will be, you CANNOT carry a game by yourself. EVER.  So yeah, I partly ""agree"" with you, in that this game's mechanics and concepts are very easy to grasp, but you are FAR from being ""done"" with learning. You've merely just begun.  I don't mean this in a condescending way, but I have around 400+ games and I feel like I'm still learning. How do I handle bad team-decisions, how do I become an efficient leader, how do I become an efficient follower, when do I swallow my pride and follow the team even when I think the tactic isn't good, when is the appropriate time to take boss, etc.  I cannot stress this enough, but yes, teamplay is just THAT important in this game. My friend and I both came from LoL, and I think I've adapted better to this game, because unlike said friend, I'm not too ""stubborn"" and often times swallow my pride and take one for the team and keep an open mind about actually learning the game, rather than thinking that ""Oh, I'm a veteran of MoBAs, I already know how this thing works"" (not saying that you're like this, but there ARE players like that here and imo it hinders their learning curve by thinking that they've nothing left to learn)"

heroesofthestorm,3e1omi,Gnueless,4,Tue Jul 21 15:04:14 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see a cross-universe skin - for instance a D3 Monk skin (I know he's the next hero, but that shouldn't matter much). Or, simply to go completely nuts: Li Lith!"
heroesofthestorm,3e1omi,SerenaRosaire,2,Tue Jul 21 07:39:58 2015 UTC,Medic Li Li?
heroesofthestorm,3e1omi,Gnueless,3,Tue Jul 21 13:20:48 2015 UTC,"Thought about it - but figured it would probably be a bit too much like Medic Uther. With that said, I'd still love to see it."

heroesofthestorm,3e3a9q,FearsomeClarinet,0,Tue Jul 21 17:11:54 2015 UTC,What I'm curious about is if he can cast entomb while dead.  That seems awesome if he can.
