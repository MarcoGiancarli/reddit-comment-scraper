Somebody might even pay you to take the electricity on a particularly bright and windy day.   Besides, coal power stations achieve 33% thermal efficiency which compares well to electricity-gas-electricity of 34% to 44% and the best CCGT get ~60% which compares well to electricity-gas-electricity and heat with cogeneration of 48% to 62%.

energy,3e3pk7,AnswerEvaded,0,Tue Jul 21 23:25:41 2015 UTC,"By introducing another completely different sort of storage problem, mind you. Hydrogen doesn't like to stay put - it's a small molecule, and like that other small obnoxious molecule (Helium) it loves to find tiny cracks to leak from. It also creates embrittlement in steel, which can lead to premature failures, particularly if someone takes... say... a natural gas pipeline and starts using it for hydrogen without completely taking it apart and making sure it's properly coated (which would probably cost more than building a new pipeline)."

energy,3e3pk7,greg_barton,3,Tue Jul 21 22:26:49 2015 UTC,"To expand on /u/AnswerEvaded   The problem with renewable energy and electrical grids in general is that unlike gas, you cant simply pack the cables with the excess energy you generate so whilst a wind farm or solar farm may be able to generate enough energy to power a town or city or country, any excess power simply cant be used. meaning when a wind turbine is turning and generating power, if the usage is less than the generated power then the difference is lost - how very inefficient.   Using hydrogen effectively acts as natural gas acts when this over generation occurs in that you can linepak it to store whilst it isn't being used. Using electrolysis we can use the power generated from your renewable sources and create hydrogen, feed this into the already existing natural gas storage, transmission and distribution networks and thus eliminate the issue of wasting the good green energy we produce and lets us use it when generation capacity is less than the usage, meaning a greater security of supply and a more efficient system.  it also means that as an example, if we were to move to fuel cell vehicles, we can cut out fuel transportation and have it direct from terminal to pump without any middle transportation, same goes for industrial appliances, co generation plants etc etc"
energy,3e3pk7,Themightysals,2,Tue Jul 21 21:01:15 2015 UTC,Unfortunately there are very high conversion loses to create hydrogen and later convert it back to electricity. There are more efficient ways to store electrical power.
energy,3e3pk7,paulwesterberg,2,Tue Jul 21 21:10:00 2015 UTC,There are indeed - but over the last year or so there have been great leaps in creating a more efficient method of conversion. of course there will be massive competition from battery power but that will ultimately benefit both storage methods in a drive to be the better solution as both have very heavy backers to succede
energy,3e3pk7,Themightysals,4,Tue Jul 21 21:15:06 2015 UTC,"There are more efficient ways to store electrical power.   More efficient in energy out/energy in, yes, but not necessarily in cost.

The cost of a tank to store hydrogen is almost certainly cheaper than the cost of the equivalent kWh of batteries."

All of the equipment was on replacement cycles and by the time the plant has reached it's 60 year life there's barely anything that's original other than the concrete building.

energy,3e0cjv,eleitl,4,Tue Jul 21 10:18:14 2015 UTC,"Why is off-grid much cheaper? perhaps with all the tax benefits this might look like the case but fundamentally I don't see why economy of scale suddenly does not work anymore because of solar. Pooling resources, wether that be power production capacity, back up capacity or storage solutions in large companies or collaboration is bound to be a more efficient use of resources. This might be different in outlying area's somewhere in the wildernis but in the densely populated area's where by far the larger part of the world population lives economy of scale is allways going to win and going off-grid will only work as long as you have an tax-regime that creates an unfair advantage."

The grid is a huge piece of infrastructure that made sense for centralistic energy production.

energy,3dzs3c,wilburspeaks,4,Tue Jul 21 01:53:35 2015 UTC,Depends on what you count as an 'energy problem'.  I think CO2 is the main problem.  Adding solar reduces CO2 emissions.  I'm less concerned with economics (because current economics don't reflect actual cost on the Earth as a whole).
energy,3dzs3c,LickitySplit939,4,Tue Jul 21 05:35:41 2015 UTC,It's actually happening because we are looking for renewable energy alternatives. Subsidies are offered to offer incentives to people and companies that come up with alternatives.  Eventually the technology will become more affordable - just like the computer you're using right now.
energy,3dzs3c,Arigateaux,2,Tue Jul 21 01:58:48 2015 UTC,"Solar doesn't work without sun. Putting solar panels in a place with 8 month winters makes no sense. Wind or nuclear would work better. Its not really a question of affordability.   Right now, solar is an exercise in subsidy farming. In Ontario, where I live, the government has guaranteed something like 80 cents /kwh (about 10x normal price for electricity) for 25 years of operation. Who wouldn't throw up panels under these conditions. That doesn't mean they are useful."

You still need generating capacity as though they weren't even there. That generating capacity needs to be subsidized to exist in the summer months when the grid is being flooded with cheap solar. Its just a terrible idea.   Probably works fine in Southern California or the Sahara - stop trying to force it in environments where its not well suited. It will end up costing us a lot more in the long run.
energy,3dzs3c,LickitySplit939,3,Tue Jul 21 02:12:06 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised how fast the snow melts off the panels once the sun comes out. All it takes is a little bit of the dark panel to show for it to start melting. Yes, they produce less in the winter, and we will need a mix of sources and storage, but saying it is a dumb idea is not a very good criticism.   The Sahara, as you mentioned, is not a good location for solar. Sand storms in the Sahara would scratch and wear the surface of the solar panels and reduce their efficiency. The Sahara also has very few people and little electric load and infrastructure. If you wanted to take the risk with the sand storms, you would need to install hundreds of miles or more of high voltage power lines in addition to the solar array."

Solar with storage has a pitiful EROEI in the best conditions (mid latitudes with full sun like death valley). In Vermont, its simply not useful. The redundancy required makes them more CO2 intensive.   Its not just the snow either. Its the angle of the sun, the amount of atmosphere it has to penetrate as a result, and the hours of daylight. Vermont averages >1200 kwh/m2 per year of useful sunlight over the year.   If we want to survive as a species, we need to consider our energy modalities dispassionately and with open minds. Solar should be used where its sunny; wind where its windy; hydro where geography makes it practical; nuclear everywhere else."

And that's just the generation component, electricity from the grid all inclusive cost 29ct/kWh, or 22ct/kWh excluding subsidies for renewable energy. So while it's not the cheapest option, it definitely is competitive, especially considering its environmental impact.  Germany's Energiewende plans have been focusing on wind energy for a long time now, by the way. Nobody is subsidising solar to the detriment of wind.

The good press Germany receives on this topic is extremely frustrating, and has convinced many people you can just throw up PV panels and all your energy problems are solved.   Germany has the most expensive electricity in the EU by far. They also have an enormously convoluted and borderline non-functional regulatory and subsidy system to accommodate their solar capacity, where massive transfers of public money take place that isn't explicitly counted in their energy costs (externalities I guess you'd call them).  Germany also has the greater redundancy of the Eurasian power grid to dilute the effective proportion of electricity generated by solar and supply backup when needed.   Ironically, Germany produces more GHG emissions now than in the past, thanks to the decommissioning of their nuclear capacity and an increase in coal and NG.

The admittedly high prices in Germany would still be among the highest in the EU without Photovoltaic. PV is responsible for ~60% of EEG costs, or about 4ct/kWh for household consumers, and maybe another 0.5ct/kWh for necessary grid enhancements. The cost of PV is also unlikely to rise much further, as from 2020 on the oldest, most expensive units will go off subsidies and will continue to produce energy. Meanwhile, photovoltaic generation has driven down peak prices considerably.   Ironically, Germany produces more GHG emissions now than in the past, thanks to the decommissioning of their nuclear capacity and an increase in coal and NG.   True, but what does that have to do with PV?  Maybe   this is a nuanced and complicated topic   and saying   PV in Germany has been an unmitigated disaster. Period.   is a simplification."

If I read it correctly, what it says is that the volume of investment in solar and wind is overtaking investment volume in fossil fuels in the US - not surprising given the amount of ""coal is dying"" stories we've been seeing lately, Middle Eastern producers trying to kill the competition, etc.  Apparently those stories also mean that throwing your money into a struggling industry is a bad idea.  It also seems to say that this is dependent on policy.  First paragraph:   Listed finance vehicles for large-scale wind and solar projects are likely to rapidly overtake the oil and gas industry in the US, but may bypass Australia altogether if the Abbott government continues to send the wrong signals to investors.   So, given favorable conditions for one side and a struggling industry on the other, solar and wind are good investments.  As long as that translates to more coal and gas staying put underground I guess that's still a victory.  Edit: This probably comes off to some as being anti-renewables.

energy,3dxy86,jamessnow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:01:06 2015 UTC,"""Is it easier than enrichment of low enriched uranium with centrifuges?""   Lots of ways to consider that question.   Removing something chemically can be much cheaper and easier than centrifuging, sure. Is there a widely known process to do so today? Perhaps not, but if you build hundreds of thorium reactors you can be damn sure people will figure it out.  More importantly, why does it have to be easier in order to be a risk?  It's other. It's added risk. More ways to make a bomb => more likely to build a bomb.   Finally, as the author said, you still need U235 to kick off any fission fuel cycle so the spread of thorium reactors necessarily implies the spread of centrifuge technology. I suppose one could imagine trying to keep the centrifuges in one country who doles out enriched uranium, but I'm not sure how realistic that would be (I think it does happen already in some cases).   Help me understand, why would you avoid U232 production in your reactor? Why not just put shielding of the type that wouldn't fit in a bomb?   It's an extra nasty gamma emitter (one of the daughters technically). Reactors are already expensive enough. I assume it would make the waste that much more difficult to deal with as well since there would be residual. On the other hand it seems like some small amount of U232 would be inevitable so perhaps extra safety precautions would be necessary regardless of the design? I'm not sure.  Also, the production of U232 implies inefficient use of neutrons, which might be overcome for example with more U235 (?), but the more U235 you have running around, the bigger the proliferation risks. I'm not sure how big a problem this actually is.  It's also worth noting that onsite processing does more than prevent the formation of U232. It also removes by products that can act as neutron sinks and interfere with the fuel cycle. Again, there are other ways around these problems but they inevitably imply more expense or more research or more enriched uranium.  It's a bit tautological but there must be reasons they did it the way they did to begin with even if I'm not enough of an expert (or privy to enough information) to say exactly why.  Edit: thinking more about it I suppose they could have done it this way in the first place specifically because they wanted to weaponize the U233, sort of the opposite of what we're talking about."

We're talking about a process that has been used by humans to build a bomb already, not going to Jupiter. Would it be more difficult than enriching uranium with centrifuges? Probably maybe but give people time and opportunity to solve the difficulties, and they will (already have to some extent). Again, a simple chemical reaction could replace the need for many rooms full of centrifuges.  If it ever became feasible from an EROEI standpoint to mine uranium from seawater, and if we build enough reactors to come to rely on said uranium, would that pose a proliferation risk? Of course it would. There's a reason the world spends so much time and treasure securing the uranium supply. It's true what they say: One nuclear bomb can ruin your whole day.   The source of fissile materials will be U-233 from thorium. Initially, it could be PU-239 and PU-240.   I'm not sure how this applies to my comment. If you're making U232 it means thorium is being converted to Pa233 and then Pa234 thus absorbing two neutrons instead of one. Of course the more desired result is U233, which is the decay product of Pa233.    Converters like Terrestrial Energy keep adding LEU to the mix. Their current plans don't include thorium, but they could.   As you know, thorium does not substitute for enriched uranium but rather for the U238. It's impossible at this point to avoid some use of U235 though with better designs it could potentially be minimized. I note that Terrestrial Energy does not try to claim zero proliferation risk and that their vision includes on site reprocessing (that's the integral part of integral molten salt reactor).   Where do you see that they did it? The original design was for a breeder reactor, but they had a later design for a converter reactor.   You may be right that weaponized U233 came from a converter reactor, but of course they still started with thorium and so the proof of concept is the same."

How can the fact that a bomb has already been built with U233 derived from thorium not be relevant.   True we were also talking about U232 as an impediment to proliferation, which you brought up and which I expanded on, but I don't see why you'd take such offense. Sorry if we got our wires crossed."

Fast breeder technology may be a promising avenue of research but is not ready for prime time. Not many who know what they are talking about seem to think the time horizon falls into the window that might help mitigate global warming, i.e. an 80 percent reduction in fossil fuel use by mid century.   (Of course that's assuming a sane world that tries to mitigate global warming and for which there is little evidence. So if it's business as usual for couple more generations then perhaps thorium will play a role in a last ditch effort to prop up our lifestyles.)  Obviously what the experts say contrasts markedly with what nuclear energy true believers will claim on the internet.  This has many implications for a possible build out of nuclear power assuming increasing global climate catastrophe sways public opinion such that a build out could be possible politically.

energy,3dx6nj,caracter_2,13,Mon Jul 20 07:27:25 2015 UTC,"Actually in Australia the market is making it harder for non-established renewables to get into the market due to how the wholesale price has been driven down by the existing wind with the combination of lower demand due to industrial turndown and solar PV.  This isn't just an issue for Nuclear in a market place with Renewables, it's an issue for any generator.  Also the goal should be to shut down fossil fuels first, then when they are gone globally the discussion on nuclear and renewables can be had. As it stands there are a few countries that look set to make Kyoto targets and those countries have a combination of Renewables and Nuclear.  This either or nitpicking amongst low carbon energy sources is only diverting attention away from fossil fuels.  The report lauds countries turning off Nuclear but the case is that the generation, if needed, to be replaced will be by a fossil fuel generator and not renewables. We saw that clearly in Japan when their imports of LNG and Coal shot up along with emissions. Australia increased the exports of Coal to Japan (largest import of Australian Coal) by 30Mt pre-fukushima to 2014.

Surely this is the market at work and a good thing?   If emerging technologies need Government aid then this should occur outside the market, and if mature technologies become commercially unviable due to low prices then that's a good thing."
energy,3dx6nj,fabianb,4,Tue Jul 21 00:07:38 2015 UTC,"Sure. I'll use South Australia as a key example as it has the highest penetration of wind and PV with the combination of new proposed renewable projects.  It's well established that because of the merit order effect (Australian market works on a bid stack arrangement, cheapest goes first and so on) that wind drives down wholesale costs as it can supply to the grid cheaply, and since it receives a subsidy under the LRET which I think is around the $23/MWh mark they can run much cheaper.  What this means is when wind is operating, which in some instances is between the 35-40% range it can drive down the spot price, particularly in SA down to the $20/MWh level and I have seen it go as low as $1.97/MWh this year in SA. This is in addition to the demand shedding that occurs due to PV usage during the day and the decline in manufacturing output in the State.  Presently there is a community consortium that has petitioned the State and Federal government to look at Solar Thermal at Port Augusta in South Australia. The local coal plant operator, Alinta Energy, has just completed an economic study into the viability of a 50MW CST plant with storage. What was uncovered was that the plant is not economical in the low wholesale price market in SA. The report noted:   However, based upon the metrics in the table below [cash flow chart], the level of expected future profitability does not justify the large capital investment required to build the facility.   Furthermore it noted:   As the metrics in the table below indicate, even if the capital costs have been over-estimated by 30%, the project would still be unviable, with a Net Present Value (NPV) of -$150.4M, and an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 7%. It is on this basis that it is considered that the project is unlikely to be commercially under any plausible cost estimate.    Metric -30% 30%    Capital Costs $403.9m $750.1m   NPV @ 12% IRR -$150.4m -$448.8m   Internal RoR 7% 7%   LCOE $149/MWh $235/MWh   Realised revenue $131/MWh $131/MWh     In essence while bringing in 30% of wind into the SA market is a great achievement it has meant that new renewable entrants have missed out due to the reduction in wholesale prices. Average wholesale price in South Australia is generally around the $40-$50/MWh mark so a LRET wouldn't assist these projects to be viable.  I hope that addresses the comment further?"
energy,3dx6nj,DangermanAus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:02:53 2015 UTC,"So the capital costs for a 50 MW solar thermal plant were about $575 million (Aus) or about $430 US. Bit over $8US/watt.   ... I think the analysis of ""why we can't make money"" could have stopped there."

I don't think the LRET subsidy necessarily changes the price that Wind will bid into the market. If the wind is blowing, wind will be in the market, irrespective of the wholesale price and irrespective of the effect of LRET.  This is just the reality of wind as an energy resource, and competing technologies need to deal with that reality. When the wind isn't blowing, the wholesale price in SA can climb very high. This is a price signal a project developer can bank on.  For example, perhaps that way to think about the role of CST is that it should be integrated into industrial processes that can use the steam, and then just bid into the market when the price is high?"
energy,3dx6nj,fabianb,2,Tue Jul 21 03:08:39 2015 UTC,It is if people want Solar Thermal to be developed in Australia.  What I mean by the wind market is that with the certificates they can run below the price needed to remain profitable as the shortfall is covered by the LRET.

One, although the author takes care to differentiate between hydro and other renewables she fails to mention what proportion of non hydro comprises biofuels. These are classed as renewable and may be better than coal but if minimising ecological impacts is your goal I think they're still pretty disastrous. without biofuels and hydro,  the proportion of 'good' renewable is still well below the contribution from nuclear.   More alarming, the author predicts that in 2050, the proportion of nuclear will still be around ten percent. This is unfortunately plausible, but the idea that a majority of the remaining ninety percent can comprise renewables, even including biofuels, is pretty far fetched. Without ramping up nuclear, base line power still comes from coal and gas. Solar and wind have their place, but you can't run cities and industries from them; nuclear is the only thing that can truly disrupt the status quo and if we're content to let its admittedly significant challenges convince us to not bother with it then we're screwed and in the back of my mind I'd think we kind of deserve it."

Why not? The FIT essentially is there to amortize the capital cost of building renewable NewGen... a cost that would have to be completely absorbed by the wholesale price if not paid as a direct subsidy.
energy,3dx6nj,DrMikeTyson,0,Mon Jul 20 21:29:47 2015 UTC,"Why not?   Because it doesn't translate 1:1. You can't say, oh, it costs X cents per kWh to consumers, so obviously the wholesale price should be higher by those X cents per kWh."
energy,3dx6nj,FormerlyTurnipHugger,3,Tue Jul 21 08:21:09 2015 UTC,The subsidies really aren't as big as some people here claim. The reason that the wholesale prices are cheap is because 30% on average of Germany's power is now essentially produced from a free resource.   I'm sorry but this is a ridiculous claim. Installed renewables are 'essentially produced for free' only if you fail to amortize the capital investment and hand-wave maintenance and administrative costs as 'too small to count'.

energy,3dx6nj,FormerlyTurnipHugger,2,Mon Jul 20 18:35:07 2015 UTC,"My argument is that there are no free markets in electricity. Completely liberalised markets are incapable of of providing the energy security, reliability and environmental profile that society requires. There are some market-based mechanisms that could concievably enable a technology-neutral, relatively interference free electricity system (such as a carbon price and capacity markets), but none have been implemented in any convincing manner. Governments continue to pick winners, meddle for short-term political gain, tax and subsidise without thinking about how this will impact the system as a whole, force quotas, shutdowns and moratoriums and generally screw with anything that could possibly be though of as a market. Germany's system of feed-in tariffs and quotas for the preferred solutions with punitive taxes and forced shutdowns for the non-favoured option is no more a free market than France's centrally planned quasi-monopoly. The UK's ROCs, FITs and CFDs are no more cost-effective for customers or free from political meddling than the CEGB was. California's liberalised clusterfuck is hardly an improvement on regulated markets in the US, or any more free from manipulation.   As far as these things go, the French model is actually not that bad - consumers get low prices, the total cost to society is actually fairly low since the government is able to take a longer-term view with capital investments, emissions are low and the electricity supply is pretty secure (especially given France's lack of coal or gas resources). Of course it isn't perfect, but no system is, and any system that seems better in theory tends to get screwed up so badly by politicians and lobby groups that it ends up worse than a simple monopoly run by technocrats."

What they don't take into account though is that the ""cheap"" price isn't cheap at all, because it is artificially achieved by selling energy at a loss, a loss which is billed to the taxpayer. Meanwhile, their infrastructure is crumbling and it is now clear that any new nuclear power will have to be sold at far far higher prices.

The subsidies aren't ""massive"". And it is, on the contrary, extremely sensible to point at wholesale prices. Germany is showing how an industrial economy can benefit massively from a renewable rollout: keeping the industry prices low and indeed lowering them even further has helped them to continue very strong growth which in turn means they have managed to keep unemployment low in an otherwise very shaken-up Europe."
energy,3dx6nj,FormerlyTurnipHugger,18,Mon Jul 20 15:05:03 2015 UTC,"Solar is not growing exponentially, for goodness sake.  In terms of actual electricity produced by solar plants (data from BP statistical review) solar has had the following growth rates over the last 5 years:  62% 93% 59% 39% 38%.  Furthermore, absolute growth is slowing in countries with developed solar industries, this is especially pronounced in Europe where absolute capacity additions in Germany and Italy are slowing rapidly.  Let us remember that wind and solar still provide about 1.5% of global energy consumption, and remember that it is easy to achieve high growth rates from a low base.  Extrapolating exponential functions is lots of fun, but it's a pretty poor idea when you want to predict how the energy system is going to develop.  Rather it's going to be a long, slow slog, as every other energy transition has been."
energy,3dx6nj,the_ultravixens,2,Mon Jul 20 14:32:11 2015 UTC,"Solar is not growing exponentially   ??   Solar most certainly has been growing exponentially to date. Globally, the installed base of solar PV is currently 100 times greater than it was a decade ago. According to this article,   http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/11/solar-energy-power-boom-charts  US growth in the last decade was 139,000% or an increase of a stunning factor of 1390. That is exponential growth.  The real question is when does growth stop being exponential? As you mention, it most certainly has stopped exponential growth in Germany and Italy. If we look at all of Europe, solar no longer has exponential growth. For the whole world though, 2014 saw 40 GW of solar PV installed and most analysts are predicting 50-54 GW for 2015. Taking the lowest number of that range still gives us a year over year increase of 25%. That is most certainly still in exponential growth range.  I do believe that the growth rate has slowed. Solar used to grow 40% a year like clockwork, so the 25% growth rate is showing solar growth to be slowing. We are also starting to run into serious grid integration issues in areas with high PV penetration. Once an area gets 5-10% of their electrical energy from solar PV, it is no longer a simple no brainer to hook up more panels to the grid. That's why we see solar slowing in Hawaii, Germany, and Italy.  As things stand now, the world gets about 1% of its electricity from solar PV, so I see no real barrier to global exponential growth continuing until about five to ten times as much solar has been installed. That's when the rubber really hits the road and technical and policy problems will have to be solved to go much beyond that."

The substantial role of Si feedstock is rooted in the fact that acquisition of SoG-Si feedstock involves a large amount of electricity consumption (e.g., Siemens and modified Siemens processes).   As I've said before, most manufacturers (Chinese too) are moving away from the Siemens process and over to  fluidised bed reactors (read about them here), which reduce the energy used for this process by 90%.  Also, the EROI of PV panels from China was calculated at around 12 fold for the main poly-si and multi-si cells. This confirms the estimates I mentioned here. And importantly, this EROI is achieved without even taking the reduction in energy use from the use of fluidised bed reactors.  If the EROI is healthy, then it's just a case of waiting for the Chinese grid to become more and more de-carbonised. This is happening already (with more renewables and nuclear).  Note that the study used LCI (life-cycle inventory) data for China from IKE, 2013. So this is outdated already as DEFRA data on the emissions intensity of the Chinese grid shows a reduction from 0.80029 kgCO2e/kWh in 2012 to 0.75245 kgCO2e/kWh in 2015 (6% drop).

It would make much more sense to make cells in places which have relatively low carbon grids, and then ship them to places such as China which have massively carbon intensive electricity.  Instead we're doing totally the opposite.   Given their relatively low EROI, high growth rate and the high carbon intensity of the grid I wouldn't be surprised if, thus far, the Chinese solar industry has net increased CO2 emissions globally.  Which, if it has happened, is fucking stupid."
energy,3dvh6d,the_ultravixens,7,Mon Jul 20 08:55:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, those are things you can say. But as pointed out by the study provided in the link to the LCA by OP and the sources I provided, little of it is true:   The study shows that the EROEI of solar is 12 (that's pretty high)  The study shows that the emissions per kWh produced by cells manufactured in China (which is the worst case) is still an order of magnitude lower than the emissions intensity of electricity provided by the vast majority of nations' electricity grids  No, even with the massive increase in China's coal consumption, the emissions intensity of the Chinese electricity grid (i.e. The emissions per KWh) continues to trend downward every year."
energy,3dvh6d,FormerlyTurnipHugger,-2,Mon Jul 20 09:42:15 2015 UTC,"1)  Yeah, one study.  Depending on sources and where you draw your boundary conditions you can get from low single figures to maybe mid-teens.  10 +/- 5 seems about ballpark.  2)  Don't dispute that.  It's still the worst case, which is nothing to celebrate in my view.  3)  Imagine you have a grid that is 100 GW of coal.  Then in 5 years time, your grid consists of 190GW of coal and 10GW of solar.  Your grid has now ""decarbonised"" by 5%.  You are arguing that this is movement in the right direction, but you're looking at completely the wrong metric."
energy,3dvh6d,the_ultravixens,3,Mon Jul 20 09:50:52 2015 UTC,It's like the story about China lowering their carbon intensity by increasing emissions and increasing GDP a bit faster.
energy,3dvh6d,caracter_2,2,Mon Jul 20 10:33:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that made me laugh.  If you recalibrate how you calculate GDP, then you can quite easily lower your $/co2 ratio without changing anything in how the physical economy functions at all.  The day the $ becomes a physically consistent unit is the day that $/co2 becomes a worthwhile measure.  Until such a day, it is meaningless."
energy,3dvh6d,caracter_2,5,Mon Jul 20 10:39:31 2015 UTC,"1) Yeah, one study. Depending on sources and where you draw your boundary conditions you can get from low single figures to maybe mid-teens. 10 +/- 5 seems about ballpark.   Well, the same study shows that multi-Si panels made in Europe have an EROEI of around 19. And this is still without taking into account the following:   Improvements in efficiency. The study still assumes C-Si panels with module efficiencies of  14.0% and 13.2% for mono and multi-crystaline respectively. Go look at the panels being sold today. (like these cheap Multi-crystaline Suntech ones or these multi-crystaline Trina ones). Many module efficiencies are starting at 16% for multi and reaching over 20% for high-efficiency mono (like using SunPower's back contact technology. Which is still expensive but continually coming down in price and in embodied energy). Fluidised bed reactors. I've mentioned this repeatedly. Many manufacturers are using this already and most have it in their roadplan to implement. The use of this alone can improve the end EROIE by 30-40%. So while I agree that it's just one study, it's far more likely that newer studies will find that the EROI of solar is substantially higher (not lower).    2) Don't dispute that. It's still the worst case, which is nothing to celebrate in my view.   It is something to celebrate. I'm saying that the worst case (cells manufactured in China) isn't so bad, and around 40% of PV cells are generated outside of China which have even less embodied energy and emissions. So overall, PV results in a substantial net reduction in emissions.   3) Imagine you have a grid that is 100 GW of coal. Then in 5 years time, your grid consists of 190GW of coal and 10GW of solar. Your grid has now ""decarbonised"" by 5%. You are arguing that this is movement in the right direction, but you're looking at completely the wrong metric.   Well, China has a big drive to keep growing and it seems fair that poor economies should have the chance to develop using carbon-intensive energy (all other developed nations did). But there is an expectation that they will transition to renewables eventually and on this front they're actually progressing well, and in some cases better than some developed nations (i.e. look at Australia's carbon intensity)."
energy,3dvh6d,4ray,2,Mon Jul 20 10:48:37 2015 UTC,"1)  The EROI figures are, in general I think, a bit of a methodological mess.  You can get whatever result you seem biased to want just by tweaking assumptions to whatever you think of as 'reasonable'.  You've got hall and prieto at one end arguing that you're sub 5, and others throwing around teens or above.  Hall and Prieto have the advantage of using data from actual large-scale operational farms, but some of their assumptions and system boundaries are perhaps suspect.  Other studies are lab based, which will probably miss a lot of real-world inefficiencies, wear and tear and so on.  More studies on large farms would be the way to go.  However I notice than in your previous posts, you're always trying to high-ball the figures.  Personally I think it's better to be conservative in these matters.  However I do agree with you that the EROI of pv is almost certainly increasing.  2)  PV doesn't guarantee net decrease in emissions.  If the growth rate of solar is higher than the inverse of it's EROI, then it will net add to emissions.  Energy cannibalism is real, and something to be avoided if possible.  3)  If poorer countries developing means that we emit sufficient CO2 to increase the likelihood of dangerous climate change, as has indisputably happened with China's incredible growth spurt, then while it might be ""fair"" to let this happen, it's also incredibly dangerous and stupid.  Transitioning to renewables ""eventually"" is not good enough.  Indeed, their current plan to peak emissions in 2030 basically pushes us miles over 2C, and that's without factoring India doing their best to imitate China.  Focussing on relative decarbonisation as you're doing is completely missing the wood for the trees."

China is already going out of their way to peak far below Western historical peak levels of per capita emissions. If you want that to happen even faster, you need to first set an example, which so far hasn't manifested, and second start coughing up more money in transfers.    Focussing on relative decarbonisation as you're doing is completely missing the wood for the trees.   What's missing the wood for trees is to permanently point to China and India—countries which still only sit at about a half, and about 20%, respectively, of the US per capita emissions.   It's a given that all developing countries must follow a trajectory of first increasing their emissions before they can decrease them once a certain development stage is reached. It's a matter of how much assistance we are willing to give in order to make that happen faster, and at lower peaks."

Yes, just like how King Canute said he'd turn back the waves.   What evidence is that?   The evidence that global emissions have risen.  A unit of GDP is not physically meaningful, therefore the metric of emission/GDP doesn't really tell us much useful.  Besides which, the global energy inteisity has stagnated in recent years.  There is no guarantee that increases in efficiency will increase at the required rate, and indeed some work suggests that it has stagnated too.  Many of the processes whose efficiency gains have helped drive the economy are now nearing their thermodynamic limits, which will also hit potential future efficiency gains.  There's also the issue of [rebound effects](www.ukerc.ac.uk/asset/3B43125E-EEBD-4AB3-B06EA914C30F7B3E).

Rocks on top of hills are a pretty low-loss storage mechanism, Wile E. Coyote aside.

The maintenance of the cars is something that will be crucial for them as well. I hope ti works out. Long term multi-MW storage will be needed.  It will be interesting to see the efficiency vs economics battle for Energy Storage going forward. Efficiency is a big issue, but when taking the end cost into account for storing renewables (especially longer term ~6 months) I believe that the most economic solutions will be pursued first. Even if they aren't the most efficient. Especially since they will be utilizing ""excess"" renewable generation.  The good news is that there is plenty of space in the Storage market for theses various solutions to compete. We'll end up with a mixed bag of many different types.

From a cost perspective, silicon is still the largest individual contributor in the overall module price. However, the percent of the overall module cost has been significantly reduced.  As Figure 4 shows, silicon has dropped from 71 percent of the total module cost for Chinese manufacturers in Q4 2008 to just 18 percent in Q4 2013""  However, what is often overlooked is that manufacturers have also reduced the per unit consumption of silicon tremendously. From over 15 grams per watt in 2000 to around 5.2 grams per watt today. This is due to combination of improvements in cell efficiency, manufacturing yields, and reduced wafer thickness.

At least the impression I got from the article is that you aren't literally buying from your neighbor, you are still grid linked, and just buying power directly. You can theoretically do this with any generator, but most wholesale markets require that you buy 1 MW minimum which is about 800-1000 houses. I'm assuming these companies are registering as a Load Serving Entity as well as a Generator Owner and probably a Generator operator. This will enable them to access the systems to schedule paths for their transactions on the grid.   The reason this will probably work well in Massachusetts is that New England has a bit of an overbuilt system that doesn't get too congested compared to other areas. If the NE market is structured at all like the market area I work for, it will not matter what negotiated rate you came up with for the actual energy, but your price can spike due to congestion and losses. Congestion is a price paid when there is insufficient transmission between two busses and losses are paid depending on how far the power is traveling."

Net metering ignores the time-variable price of energy and compensates all solar generation at the retail rate (this part is true in most states). So the extra credits that can be transferred from one customer to another (which is only available in MA) have the value of a kWh at the flat retail rate as well. And given that MA has some of the highest retail energy rates and a healthy SREC incentive program, it's pretty easy to make money."
energy,3dtzza,No_Cat_No_Cradle,5,Tue Jul 21 02:05:58 2015 UTC,"So I figured I should go read up on Massachusetts's Net Metering law to understand how exactly this would work.   The value of [excess] Net Metering Credits at the end of a billing period is slightly less than the utility’s full retail rate for Class I solar and wind facilities, Class II facilities, and Class III facilities used by government customers as they would receive credit for the default service, distribution, transmission, and transition charge (kilowatt hour, kWh). Net Metering Credits for Class III facilities and neighborhood facilities that are used by customers other than government entities differs only in that they do not receive credit for the distribution component.  [NEM] credits from net metering facilities may be transferred to another customer of the same utility as long as they are within the same service territory and ISO-NE load zone.   So I guess the idea of this website is that it links up people with excess NEM credits to sell, rather than just take the default compensation provided by the utility.  If I understand correctly, the purchaser of the NEM credits will be able to use them to count against the full retail rate of their own consumption... even though they are still totally using the utility's distribution (and possibly transmission lines). The export of energy from a NEM customer's meter to the local distribution grid offsets the utility's need to procure generation, but does nothing to offset the need for wires to deliver energy to the customer buying NEM credits.  So, basically this is just a start-up who has figured out how to game NEM rules. Great! The sooner NEM becomes an even more broken policy, the sooner it gets replaced with something that provides accurate price signals for the value of distributed generation."

Actually, the tech was probably 'expired' / outdated by the time it turned on ('how old is YOUR computer?').   Scientists are amazing humans. From what i know, we could easily make 'clean-coal' - but we don't - there just ain't the money to make it worthwhile. We can afford billions of dollars for 'sports' or 'porn' as a species but we really cannot walk to the street corner to fix a leaky <name your pollution>.  I love massive fast-breeder reactors that no one touches for a century (Bill Gates promoted this). But what about the small ones?  http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/09/miniature-nuclear-reactors-los-alamos  They have a six year waiting list - everyone wants one. Imagine how much a super-tanker could SAVE if they put one on their ships! Put one in your car! What could possibly go wrong?"

It's not perfectly safe.  It's all relative.  If you are on board the ship then you risk drowning. So, you have to ask the question:  Safe for whom?  And what are the relative risks?  Radioactive risks from plutonium and uranium? Water blocks radiation from plutonium and uranium enough that it's relatively safe to view fuel that is under water at an adequate depth.  This XKCD shows the exponential drop off in radiation due to water.  Remember that plutonium and uranium are very heavy and drop to the bottom.  https://what-if.xkcd.com/29/  https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/29/pool_safe.png  The fission products are what we worry about most in the case of a nuclear accident.

If I have a five year old Tesla, I'm going to swap it out for a newer battery and repeat this process every five years or so. Supposedly a consumer would get a small credit for swapping to an older battery, but the batteries seem too expensive to make that work out."

If they have the tech, it could be better would be measuring the degradation caused be usage and charge based on that instead (depends on how customers would face this psychologically) -- so if at any time you decide to leave the program you may get a brand new battery, because you've already paid for it.

However, the authors caution that more study is needed to determine how specific, individual toxicants or combinations may increase hospitalization rates. For example, the increase in cardiology hospitalizations could be related to an increased exposure to air pollution such as diesel exhaust and fine particulate matter; however, this would require personal monitoring studies to measure exposure to specific toxicants, Panettieri notes. “Our findings provide important clues to design epidemiological studies to associate specific toxicant exposures with health end-points.”   And   While the study does not prove that hydraulic fracturing actually causes these health problems, the authors say, the hospitalization increases observed over the relatively short time span of observation suggests that healthcare costs of hydraulic fracturing must be factored into the economic benefits of unconventional gas and oil drilling.   Yet the authors go an make a policy call based on no evidence of the causation.  This is as bad as those studies that have people getting headaches near wind turbines and concluding wind turbines are bad.  Correlation =/= Causation.  It doesn't matter if it's gas, solar, wind, nuclear etc. production these lazy health studies need to be relegated into the bad science basket when they attempt to draw a conclusion the paper does not support."

This is part of why the costs and licensing took so long for Monticello to reach their target uprate power limit.   It also puts some very interesting restrictions on operation as well as increasing the need for prompt actions during isolation ATWS scenarios. Core stability/oscillation limits now become the predominant factor for your MCPR safety limit. No Safety relief valves can be out of service to ensure that transients in the MELLLA+ domain don't result in MCPR violations of unnecessary stability issues. The OPRMs (oscillation power range monitor) now need to have a new algorithm to rapidly detect and suppress core oscillations that occur in this domain, as oscillations can onset faster and differently than they do outside of the MELLLA+ domain. For ATWS scenarios prompt inject of boron and lowering of water level is required to prevent fuel damage from oscillations. So it's a very different beast for the operators to deal with.

That still doesn't mean you don't have really good energy multiplication.  Assume the fission segment has a neutron multiplication factor of 0.9. Assume you have a fusion system that creates 1/3x the energy in fusion as electricity it takes to make the reaction.  Take 100 joule of electricity, make 33 joule of fusion energy. D-T reaction means 25 joules is neutrons and 8 is helium heat. Put one high energy neutron (14 Mev) into a fission mass of k=0.9, you get 9 fissions. (infinite summation of 0.9n ) Each fission is 190 Mev. So 25 joules of neutrons become 958 joules of heat.   Add in 8 joules of helium heat, you have 966 joules thermal.   Say basic steam rankine cycle heat production, you get 322 joules of electricity out, 100 joules goes back to fusion. 222 joules of net electricity.  Now, this is very conservative numbers. But the fission system can stay very noncritical and still produce a whole bunch of fission heat. And the fusion system can be far from parity and still drive it.   You are right, the biggest issue to be keeping the neutron flux high enough to keep the fission segment temperatures high enough to drive a turbine. But there is margin within existing physics knowledge space.   If I can burn down to k=0.9 instead of k=1.0 which is required for fast reactors, I can burn a lot out a lot more actinides without reprocessing."

I can't think in Joules but k = 0.9 means you get an average of 0.9 further fissions resultant neutrons (being dumb), not 9. A higher energy neutron might release an extra fraction of a neutron than thermal but it that's it. Systems at k = 0.9 are safely subcritical and don't produce appreciable amounts of energy form the odd fission here and there, you can stand next to them.

Those 81 fissions cause 73 more fissions (0.93 ). Each generation is fewer fissions (subcritical), but the sum of fissions caused by injection of 100 neutrons adds up to 900 fissions. 100*sigma(0.9x, x from 1 to infinity)=900."
energy,3dlenx,GeorgeTheNerd,0,Fri Jul 17 19:46:20 2015 UTC,"Not quite. The neutron multiplication factor is neutrons per generation. so if you start with 100 neutrons, you'll have 90 neutrons resulting from fissions caused by those 100. That's about 36 fissions to create those neutrons in a fast system. Most operating reactors are controlled to critical by the delayed neutrons from fission products which is much slower. You could therefore keep a reactor critical using an external source but k would have to be very close to 1 from just the fission system. In a normal fast reactor this requires a lot of enrichment of the fuel."

energy,3dlenx,Shriguy,3,Fri Jul 17 18:55:27 2015 UTC,"parity means the energy break even point for fusion.  Fusion reactors already exist, but the problem is they use more energy than they create. So they may take 100 joules of electricity and produce only 33 joules of fusion heat. The other 67 joules is lost from things like radiative heat losses. Parity in this case is such a reactor that takes 100 joules of energy and produces 100 joules of fusion heat.   A pure fusion power plant would have to have a reactor with a ratio greater than parity to be practical. Whereas a hybrid reactor can use a fusion reactor with an energy ratio below parity and be practical."

Oil wells are incredibly expensive, often high risk assets, the have incredibly steep decline curves.  As a result, most oil companies, in order to simply stay in business reinvest 95% of the profits because the assets they have already payed for decline in revenue 20% a year.  Unlike factories which may slightly depreciate but the revenue they generate is fairly flat year to year.  As a result, losing even as little as 48 million can be significant.  They may not be able to drill an offshore well this year as a result.  Which means the following year that might turn into falling behind by 2 wells and so on.  The oil industry is about spending money fast enough to grow your production.  Otherwise your revenue shrinks and shrinks very quickly.  It's not just 48MM dollars today...  It's 48MM dollars that would have likely grown at an average of 30% a year.  Just like mocando isn't just 35B dollars...

energy,3djdtx,TakeCareOfTheEarth,5,Fri Jul 17 00:36:48 2015 UTC,"Will this trend continue indefinitely, or level off soon?   It already did ""level off"". The majority of the cost reductions were in taking what was a niche, almost ""boutique"" battery chemistry -- made for over a decade at a certain price point for markets that were able to justify the higher costs.  And then taking that chemistry, and CHOOSING to commercialize it and scale up from boutique to mass production (as a market for a higher-energy density and flatter discharge product materialized and matured), and more recently ramping up production in cheaper labor locations (which also have less restrictive environmental regulations, etc).  IOW: the vast majority of the gains from ""economies of scale"" have in fact already been reaped, and likewise with economies from ""globalization"" as well as taking advantage of currency-exchange gains (i.e. shifting production to china & other low-wage low-regulation countries)... and it happened in a relatively short time -- because the new chemistry batteries were adapted into an existing format and easily swapped into a wide array of product applications, mostly just displacing/replacing previous battery chemistries (NiMH, NiCad) in the same product applications, but providing better performance (and at only a slightly higher price premium).  Despite the hoopla (and the ridiculous claims of this article and the even more ridiculous claims of this ""paper study"" {a paper study that is almost entirely speculation with virtually no hard data -- an phenomenon that is sadly becoming a ""trend"" in so called ""sciences""}) -- for all practical purposes, virtually none of the production capacity was built for, much less driven by BEV demand.  Why? Well, the reason is simple, at current production numbers BEV's (yes even including the over-hyped Tesla) are a tiny and essentially insignificant fraction of the total market for Li-Ion batteries; ""Home Energy Storage"" systems are an even a tinier fraction of that.  Don't believe me? Well here's the data on the market segments as of 2015. (And note that the vast majority of the ""Automobile"" category is not BEV's, it's hybrids and industrial vehicles {forklifts and such}.)  So given that the biggest category is ""consumer electronics"" -- well what exactly does that mean, what ARE they being used for?  Well here's what Panasonic is focused on:    Power tools GPS devices Handhelds [i.e. various] Shavers Toothbrushes [electric] Notebooks [computers] Garden tools Medical equipment Smartphones E-bikes     OK, what about the ""claims"" and worse the ""projections"" of this paper?  They're the product of a myth, and a misunderstanding of what happened with Lithium-Ion production.  The myth is that batteries will follow a sort of ""Moore's Law"" downward cost versus upward performance trends; nothing of the kind IS happening with batteries, and nothing of the kind has EVER occurred with batteries (nor ever will).    The reason that Moore's Law occurred with semiconductors is due primarily to the inverse square principle of optics, versus density (and that also affects speed) -- double the resolution you can image the transistors with and you quadruple the number that can fit in the same space as well as reducing the distance signals travel by a factor of four; double the resolution again and you quadruple the density and quarter the speed yet again -- that leads to a relatively rapid, exponential increase in performance, at the same essential material cost; add in ""tweaking"" of production quality and yield is improved which substantially lowers per unit cost even further.  Despite the claims of various ""futurology"" cultists, Moore's law doesn't apply to much of anything OTHER than semiconductor-related products. It is NOT a ""general principle of technology progress"" -- that's just a bogus claim of people who cannot differentiate cause and effect.  All Battery cost reductions (like just about all other product productions) generally follow an ""S"" curve.  We are accustomed to seeing an ""S"" curve as it applies to the adoption of a technology -- but the same curve applies in an inverted form to cost.  The DECEPTIVE thing about S-curve phenomenon/trends, is that in the fairly early stages, they really do LOOK like they are following an ""exponential"" (i.e. Moore's Law - like) trend -- and if you are a ""true believer"" and looking to justify/rationalize your hopeful/wishful thinking, there is a massive temptation to believe that the trend will continue.  But the reality is that when that apparent massive upward gain in quantity/decrease in cost is due to ""economies of scale"" -- well, they simply DON'T (cannot) continue ad infinitum; once the main economies of scale (in terms of both production AND saturation of major market demand), well the later gains tend to diminish, and eventually become so minimal that no other real gains will be achieved (certainly no MAJOR/significant cost savings).  The only way to alter that equation is to do something drastic -- i.e. shift production to a lower cost labor market, take short-cuts in terms of environmental aspects, further ""tweak"" the standardization, automation & packaging of the units, etc.  In the case of batteries, nearly ALL of those aspects were already almost fully realized -- battery production is a fairly MATURE industry, it has been ""perfected"" and ""optimized"" across a number of different chemistries over the years -- and even nearly all of the advantages of globalization have already been reaped as well.  End result is that while there MAY still remain some efficiencies to be gained in terms of ""battery pack"" construction -- the gains and cost reductions of the actual battery manufacture are virtually already ""in the can"".  Increased demand (from a new additional ""market/application"" like BEV's and HES's) really doesn't alter that equation.  Unlike with Moore's law where the same facility can produce 2x or 4x the product (and a faster/better product) using the same materials, and the same facility with a doubling of the resolution... the production of batteries from a factory is not going to increase in that exponential fashion.  If you want to double your production, you need to build a second factory, with a parallel set of production equipment, supply lines, etc.  Building some ""Gigafactory"" may sound like it's going to provide some major gains in cost reduction, but in reality it's more of a phantom than reality -- a nice ""story"" to entice investors, to trick states into providing subsidies, etc -- but the cost reductions simply aren't going to be there (not in a MAJOR way).    And yes that means Elon Musk is more than a bit of a 'con artist'* -- and indeed he's a very GOOD one, quite savvy at manipulating the press -- but really he's not going to get the gains he's promised: what he's counting on (betting on) is that via one mechanism or another, the cost of oil/gasoline is going to increase (hence among other things his support for the ""enviro"" stuff, because if oil/gasoline costs don't rise naturally... well, there's always the possibility of having the government intervene their too, sort of the opposite way they've already been subsidizing his businesses; this time by making his competition artificially cost more).  * I also know that SAYING that means this post will be downvoted to oblivion, because Reddit LURVES Elon Musk.  But downvoting doesn't change reality."

energy,3djdtx,TakeCareOfTheEarth,3,Sat Jul 18 02:21:56 2015 UTC,"So what would it take to reduce the cost of batteries even further? Fundamentally different technology that utilizes cheaper materials?    Cheaper batteries aren't the point. We already have cheaper materials and cheaper batteries made from them; in fact some chemistries are a fraction of the cost of Lithium-Ion, but they're not rechargeable; others are slightly lower cost the Li-Ion, but their charge/discharge & lifecycle aren't as good* (so we're willing to pay the premium).    No the big key is ENERGY DENSITY -- how much of a charge (mAh) can the thing hold versus how much does it weight; a close second is how fast can the stuff be charged/recharged (especially without reducing the product lifespan); and finally, what are the energy discharge and lifecycle curves like.  As far as all-electric vehicles, that first is probably the most important, because with BEV's the battery has to haul ALL of the vehicle, PLUS it's own sorry-arse weight around, whether it's at 10% charge or 90% charge that weight doesn't change. (By contrast, one of the inherent ""beauties"" of hydrocarbon fuels is not just that they're so energy dense, we're talking >10x that of the best production battery chemistry we have {or are likely to have}, but you don't have to haul a refinery around with you; the total weight of the fuel is small to begin with and grows less as you consume it, but the ""dead weight"" of the empty fuel tank is trivial.)  What that ends up meaning is that there is a pragmatic limit to a BEV that is just insanely short of what we've become accustomed to with hydrocarbon vehicles -- the more total power capacity you want to carry along with you, the higher the amount of ""dead weight"" versus ""useful load"" you're going to be hauling as well. (note there are similar limits with hydrocarbon vehicles, especially small aircraft whereMaximum Gross Take Off Weight places practical limits on total cargo & passenger load versus the planes lift capacity, which is also dependent on air temp & air density.)    Sadly, despite all of the exaggerated claims that you see in the news (i.e. ""New Battery Technology promises 10x better performance at 1/10th the cost -- and it runs on water man! Can you believe that a battery that runs on water!"" Ok, sorry couldn't resist) -- yeah well there doesn't really appear to be anything on the near-horizon that can or will be commercialized anytime soon. (Keep in mind that Lithium based battery chemistry was arguably discovered/invented back as far as 1912, and there were ""boutique"" lithium batteries in production in the 1970's, and low scale commercial production in the late 80's and early 1990's... the ""push"" to get/make better batteries really came from the solidly project-able future of semiconductors, it became obvious even by the mid-80's that digital electronics were on a multi-generation exponential increase in performance, versus decrease in size and power needs, and that within a few decades it would reach the point where portable computers and then even handheld devices would create a demand that would be willing to pay a premium for a better battery {lower weight, higher performance, faster recharge, longer life} -- technically you could run an iPhone, or a laptop, on a battery pack filled with standard non-rechargeable Alkaline or even old Zinc-Carbon based ""AA"" or ""AAA"" batteries, you'd just have to put new ones in every 6 to 8 hours, and the cost & waste would be phenomenal.)  And the thing is -- the above -- well, that's where we've gotten this ""myth"" that battery performance has gotten so much better.  Because the processor demands for power have gotten lower, the devices seemed to run a lot longer (a flip-phone cell phone can go a week+ without a recharge on ""standby"", whereas a cell-phone from the early 1990's wouldn't last a day on standby without a recharge, and weighted >50x as much). We've had some backtracking on that, as brighter higher res screens and things like GPS have been added -- but generally speaking the improvements (tweaking) in battery performance have been able to (more or less) keep up with expectations... but the gains haven't been anything like a ""Moore's Law"" exponent; they only appear that way if you construct a complete lie and posit an early 2000's ""origin"" for your price performance curve (which is what the guys in the ""study"" the linked article did; it's borderline fraud to claim that but no doubt they'll get away with it, probably even profit from it in terms of career/funding because they've served as useful PR tools.)    * And by the way the Li-Ion chemistry is far from perfect, in fact one of its chief features is also one of its biggest drawbacks and will probably be one of the sources of product ""hatred"" in the future (and in some senses has already started). And that's it's lifespan curve (which is much like it's discharge curve).  Most batteries s-l-o-w-l-y and steadily degrade in their performance, both in terms of the power they provide, and as they age, so there is a sense ""he this battery is getting worn out/worn down"" kind of like walking down a shallow incline... not so with Li-Ion, it's almost ""deceptive"" in how well it maintains a charge, and in how it's lifecycle goes, to use the hill metaphor you're walking along on ground that only has an ever so tiny downward incline so small you think you're walking on flat ground, until with virtually no warning you waltz right off the edge of a proverbial cliff; it's not quite vertical but it may as well be... And just like that, the battery that seemed to be working fine 5 minutes ago is proverbially ""dead"" and needs to be recharged; worse the battery that just 3 days ago took a full charge that was still fairly near it's original ""new"" performance... well now it won't take a charge at all; period. It's Dead-dead, and in electrical energy terms is as useful as... well a ""brick"".    One last note. I have little doubt that Nikolai Tesla would be appalled at seeing his name on a BATTERY based vehicle -- the very idea of that, hauling around a massive dead-weight DIRECT current power source would have driven him round the bend -- he would probably say our entire approach to ""electric vehicles"" is absurdly wrong, and that we should be looking at an AC based system, something akin to the old electric street cars that ran on suspended power lines... though doubtless he'd also come up with (or at least be hard at work on) something far more elegant: either wireless power transmission (on a mass scale), or else if wired, based on some indirect induction along a buried cable... and bar that, he'd probably be advocating something like local hydrogen production & a compressed hydrogen fuel."

'Economies of scale' mean nothing to raw material producers, who base their accounting on all in sustaining costs.    Yes, first of all there is a law or principle of Diminishing Returns making an operation bigger and then even bigger yet doesn't necessarily gain you as much as people imagine (or project, or ""sell"" others on), and in some cases gains you nothing at all and can even increase your costs unnecessarily; and thus there are also inherent ""Diseconomies of Scale"" -- which is a very real thing that most people simply ignore or are unaware of.  The classic example I use with people is digging a hole in the ground*: the bigger in diameter you make your hole, and the deeper you go, the greater the forces at play that are likely to cause the walls to cave in on you (and fill in the hole from the bottom up). So once you go beyond a certain (relatively small) hole diameter and depth, you no longer even TRY to dig straight down, or to line/support the walls... instead you have no choice but to begin terracing the sides, and for every foot you go down, you need to expand by two foot (four foot square) the diameter of your hole on top, and in successive terraces... in fairly short order (and increasing at an exponential rate) you find that for every new square foot at the deep center of the hole (or ""pit"") you're having to remove a shit-ton, then 4 shit-tons, then 16 shit tons of material from the upper & outer slopes.  Eventually, it's no longer worth the effort (even if there's still ""good stuff"" down there... it's probably available elsewhere with less work).  The same -- or a similar -- principle applies to a lot of other things (aka Shlemiel the Painter, etc) -- some times there are other, smarter approaches (hence underground mining versus open pit mining, etc); and other times, well reality just has practical limits and what you are attempting may simply NOT be pragmatic.  * This is why I think every small boy (preferably with a couple of brothers or other partners in crime) should be handed a shovel or two, and told to try go out to the backyard and try digging a hole to China (or I suppose if they are Chinese boys, a hole to America)... they'll soon enough learn the principle. ;-)     Mines are not going to cut prices - especially in a growing demand scenario - just to suit Musk   Whether or not mines and supplies of things like Lithium end up being the main encumbrance... I dunno, probably for a while, and then yes competitive bidding on those resources will likely keep the price from declining in anything like the rapid fashion that Musk projects.  Eventually, yes prices of the raw materials MAY go down (or cycle up/down fairly dramatically as we have seen with Oil & Coal, and various other metals, etc).  But to my mind that's really not the problem. The base problem is that the story Musk is ""selling"" is fundamentally fraudulent; basically he's giving people the idea that current battery production is hugely INefficient and low-level.  Which is simply bullshit. Panasonic alone is cranking out billions upon billions of 18650 cells on an annual basis; and is already pretty much doing everything it can to optimize its operations, its logistics, etc.  Plopping a megafactory, erm excuse me a ""gigglefactory"" oops I meant a ""Giga-Factory"" in the middle of the frigging desert... a place that is nowhere NEAR supply ports or major supply lines, or skilled population, or... well.  There is another big BIG project that it reminds me of, also highly touted at the time, and with all kinds of grandiose promises: Fordlândia  It too was going to be a triumph of the ""economies of scale"", and the power of making a major capital investment in the middle of no & where; and much like Musk's GigaFactory, was dependent upon a whole host of ""gambles"" (technological and other) all paying off together in a positive fashion and in a complex intertwined/interdependent manner; if & when any one of them fails, the rest are undermined, and the whole house of cards collapses (or certainly doesn't succeed)."

Taking into account REAL WORLD maintenance, not this bs that ""oh, solar is zero maintenance"".  http://reneweconomy.com.au/2013/hidden-cost-of-rooftop-solar-who-should-pay-for-maintenance-99200  Panels need to be cleaned, in many cases multiple times per year. While a brand-spanking-new system just installed a year or to prior may get away with no maintenance or inspection, that isn't going to be true across some 20+ year lifespan. That's not to mention the repair/replacement of panels (and/or additional insurance to cover same), the 3 to 8 year replacement of inverters/batteries (and all systems have one or both), the potential damage to roofing (and the structure) from a poor installation, but which may not become evident for several years; the additional cost to work on or repair roofs due to the need to carefully remove and reinstall the panels, and so on.  Moreover the majority of the sales pitches about ""all the money you'll save"" are based off of initial tax credits and then dubious/fraudulent computations about heavily/ridiculously exaggerated future per kWh grid costs; and entirely ignoring/dismissing that there is/will be a base ""grid connection"" fee that will not go away and in fact is more likely to increase, and at a higher rate than actual kWh costs).  The plain truth of the matter is that the amount of electricity a household NEEDS to use, will generally be a fraction of the cost of an installed and properly maintained system... even if the panels were ""free"". Heck, the average household electricity cost isn't much more than the operational & maintenance costs of the solar... not counting the installation & capital investment.  So why then are solar leasing companies installing the things all over the place? Because much like the housing bubble, it's a massive financial scam - big payouts & upfront profits for the industry - and locking people into contracts for 20+ years, while ""securitizing"" & selling off that lease. And -- just like the housing bubble -- the majority of the press & population are too busy being ""boosters"" of this ""amazing/wonderful"" trend (I mean the shows about solar invariably feature something akin to: ""Wow just look, that electric meter is running backwards* ... so amazing!! We're... saving the planet! WooHoo!!"" and other assorted inanities.)    Of course the numbers the sales pitchman pushes... don't always end up being anywhere near the reality, not of course that he necessarily cares; he's on to the next victim erm I mean ""lucky customer"".  The denial of what is actually going on is fairly strong... eventually the realization will set in; but of course by then... well, there's gonna be a lot of dead/inactive panels attached to roofs, and a significant number of them are going to be on empty houses."

I don't get my plumbing or wiring inspected annually. Do you?    Most people get their furnaces & AC units serviced with a ""preventative maintenance"" check at least once every year (but in the case of both, that tends to mean a service call in late spring for the AC, and a separate service call in the fall for the furnace) -- the cost is generally pretty minimal, probably around $100 to $150 (if no parts or return trips are needed), but it isn't ""free"".   And yes people CAN either just entirely ignore the ""preventative maintenance"" schedule -- and then pay significantly more for ""emergency service"" when the unit breaks. Alternately of course they could learn how to do the inspection/cleaning themselves, but the majority won't -- and that's with things that are fairly basic and located on ground level with easy access.   5) Inverters do not last as long as the panels, it is true.

energy,3djdtx,Absinthe99,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:17:44 2015 UTC,"BTW the worst part of the article/study is this:    Nykvist and Nilsson say their data indicate that battery pack costs will continue their precipitous decline, perhaps even reaching the point where Li-ion battery systems on electric vehicles reach parity with gas-guzzling vehicles. (Although the authors of the paper admit that this point, if we ever reach it, is still far in the future—not something we're likely to see this year or next.)    Ok, I've already covered (in more detail in my other reply-comment ITT) that an ""S-curve"" at the early and mid-stages LOOK like things are following an ""exponential"" curve.    If you are naive about (or oblivious to) the actual history & causes of the decline muck up your timeline (either unwittingly or on purpose) then you are going to be tempted to ""continue"" that curve as a projection into the future (Cf the circa 1999 book ""Dow 36,000"" or as I like to call it the ""To Infinity And Beyond"" space cadet principle).  And therein lies the problem.    Note the phrase ""their data indicate"" -- that's right, the charts apparently ""whispered"" in a ghostly fashion to them, reached out a ghostly hand with a finger that pointed up, up, up & away!    No of course not!  The data did no such thing; data are just passive, dead numbers in a spreadsheet that are then plotted on a chart or graph... data don't DO anything, they certainly don't ""speak"" or even ""indicate"" anything -- what happens is that WE HUMANS impose our preconceived notions, our wishful thinking, our hopes & dreams down onto that data, those charts & graphs -- we HUMANS are the ones who foolishly ASSUME the trend is ""unstoppable"" (hand waving our faith that it is some ""inherent mystery force"" of ""progress"" i.e. as if  it were some supernatural teleological ""divine"" force) and then we draw the dotted line projecting into the future; the data points don't do that, they just sit there (cause they're just marks on a page or dots on a screen).    Then note that subsequent admission... yeah, the ""precipitous"" decline in costs, well it's apparently NOT (even according to these dolts when they are put under pressure) going to continue to be so ""precipitous"" after all...   In fact they admit that -- despite the previous high-flying sensational bullshit -- it is already diminishing (if not already ""flattened"" and virtually over with at the battery ""cell"" production level). Further cost reductions are possible, even probable but they're going to take far longer and be far less, i.e. nothing like as precipitous or major as prior ones: returns are diminishing, and gains from effort (even vastly multiplied efforts & investments) are decreasing... meaning the major ROI is already done; it can be replicated to expand total capacity, but the price of the cells is NOT going to be chopped in half again, the performance is NOT going to be doubled again.   Moreover, the limitations and problems inherent in the tech are now (soon, within the next few years) going to start to become increasingly apparent. A vehicle that essentially becomes a useless dead ""brick"" at around the 8 year, 100,000 mile mark, and which requires a replacement component that is equivalent to about 50% of the price of a NEW vehicle... is just NOT a sustainable product; not versus a competing product that retains functionality (with only minimal repair/maintenance costs) into the 15 even 20 year and 200,000+ mile range.  Most people ignore just how much the ""new"" car market is actually dependent upon the trade-in/used vehicle market; and few think of how much ""economic value"" our society continues to extract from them -- it's a critical part of the equation not only from a financial viewpoint, but also a societal sustainable-resource standpoint. (Much the same as housing; the economy relies very heavily on the idea that at the end of a mortgage, the home will have solid and serious ""retained value"" -- repairs and renovation may be necessary, but the whole thing doesn't need to be destroyed & rebuilt from scratch -- and if the market were to build homes in that fashion {and some would argue that many recent homes have been} then there will be a rather MAJOR net negative consequence: societal wealth will have been ""mal-invested"" and the overall society will be poorer as a result.)    EDIT Also one other thing, which is especially important to the above and how they have ""derived"" their data points (essentially trying to reverse engineer numbers from public statements), and that is THIS article, which concerns the ""deal"" with Panasonic & Tesla:  http://seekingalpha.com/article/1797442-teslas-new-battery-supply-contract-trick-or-treat     ""By most estimates, the battery for the Model S that I drove should cost between $42,500 and $55,250, or half the cost of the car. But (Tesla Tech Officer) Straubel indicated that it is already much lower. ""They're way less than half, actually,"" he says. ""Less than a quarter in most cases.""*   I have no reason to question the accuracy of Mr. Straubel's claim, which suggests a pack level battery cost of about $25,000 and a cell level cost of about $2. After all, outfits like Panasonic that have excess production capacity and are trying to find new markets for long-in-the-tooth legacy products will frequently offer loss leader pricing during the launch phase because they know they'll be able to catch up quickly if an embryonic market matures into a stable market.  While companies like Panasonic are frequently willing to sacrifice short-term profit to achieve long-term goals, particularly if they can do so without incurring substantial capital costs, no company can buy for a dime, sell for a nickel and make it up on volume. They never incur significant capital costs to expand capacity for a money losing product line.  If Bloomberg's estimate of Panasonic's expected revenue under the new contract is accurate, it looks like the honeymoon is over, Panasonic is done with loss leader pricing and the battery packs Tesla builds in the future will cost $8,000 to $12,000 more than they did during the launch phase.    IOW Tesla has been building cars with the equivalent of ""free samples"" from Panasonic, which had EXCESS inventory (the article even notes that some 18650 production lines had been shut down/mothballed because they'd adapted/built out TOO MUCH capacity) -- of course the cells weren't actually ""free"", but they were sold at a loss with the hopes of helping/stimulating the development of a new market.  The paper didn't take any of that into account -- the authors were probably entirely unaware of the possibility (hey they're academics/researchers/number crunchers, not industry people -- they're probably entirely oblivious to those kinds of ""deals"").  * Last note, I've seen that quote the ""Less than a quarter in most cases."" bandied about all over the place; but what no one ever seems to really ask is less than a quarter of WHAT? Specifically, what ""figure"" what ""cost"" is the battery less than a quarter of? Most people simply jump on the ""retail price"" (and they especially love to quote the lowest/cheapest ""base configuration"" prices that are already reduced by various subsidies and credits). Problem is that Tesla has actually been selling cars at prices that are (according to many analysts) in fact below cost, and then recouping money via the various zero-emission credit sales, etc.    And note that there is a HINT that he's misleading/tricking people in that little phrase at the end: ""in most cases"".  What does that mean? Well it certainly means ""not in ALL cases""... so that rules out MSRP prices of the cheapest/base configuration; it can really ONLY mean that the majority of cars sold, i.e. the median price of a fully-decked out machine with all (or even just most) of the possible ""luxury"" options (cause lets face it, the model S is not being sold as an econo box to pizza delivery boys; the people who are buying these things largely have access to financing and want most if not all of those luxury features); and then toss in shipping, taxes, etc.  What you end up with is probably something for a retail price of around $140k or more... and 1/4 of that is $35k, not 1/4 of some $65k base price (i.e. $15k); And that is if we assume he's talking what the customer ""paid"", if in fact Tesla is shifting these things around at below manufacturing cost (and indeed counting on those ZERB credit sales, etc), then the cost of that battery pack could easily be $40k or more... and that's WITH the ""cheap sample"" cells Panasonic has been supplying.    Ergo even if you take the lowest of those probable figures, say ~$30k for the 85kWh pack (based on 1/4 of a median model -- i.e. ""most cases"" -- sale price of $120k), and chop that in half for a 42.5kWh/100 mile range econo box, you're still looking at a $15k battery pack cost (prior to removal/installation labor fees). That makes the fully depreciated 8 year ""used"" value of that vehicle virtually zero: i.e. a worthless brick that has only part-out and/or scrap value (and  the latter might actually be negative, as the Lithium battery pack needs to be properly removed/recycled/disposed of, unless the scrap dealer want to melt his ""car crusher"", he can't drop it into one like he can with an old ICE vehicle).  Again that's the dangers of people making these kinds of ""wishful thinking"" estimates from numbers they garner via ""hints"" and qualified statements from executives (who generally know how to ""hedge"" their words to convey one thing while actually saying another)."

However, the authors caution that more study is needed to determine how specific, individual toxicants or combinations may increase hospitalization rates. For example, the increase in cardiology hospitalizations could be related to an increased exposure to air pollution such as diesel exhaust and fine particulate matter; however, this would require personal monitoring studies to measure exposure to specific toxicants, Panettieri notes. “Our findings provide important clues to design epidemiological studies to associate specific toxicant exposures with health end-points.”   And   While the study does not prove that hydraulic fracturing actually causes these health problems, the authors say, the hospitalization increases observed over the relatively short time span of observation suggests that healthcare costs of hydraulic fracturing must be factored into the economic benefits of unconventional gas and oil drilling.   Yet the authors go an make a policy call based on no evidence of the causation.  This is as bad as those studies that have people getting headaches near wind turbines and concluding wind turbines are bad.  Correlation =/= Causation.

(read up on Dennis Ross)  Iran's nuclear program, which started at the encouragement of the US, for justifiable economic reasons despite Iran having oil http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3983-2005Mar26.html  http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/14/opinion/14iht-edsahimi_ed3_.html  was in fact quite legal. http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/09/iran-nuclear-power-un-threat-peace  Nevertheless, Iran had historically been making significant compromise offers on its nuclear program, that the US ignored or even actively killed off, in order to prevent a peaceful resolution and to keep the ""Iranian nuclear threat"" alive.  http://news.antiwar.com/2011/04/20/elbaradei-us-europe-werent-interested-in-compromise-with-iran/  http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/05/opinion/05iht-edzarif.html?_r=0  These offers were either ignored or even actively undermined  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/17/AR2006061700727.html  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10007603/Iran-how-the-West-missed-a-chance-to-make-peace-with-Tehran.html  Even in the first Obama administration, Iran agreed to the terms of a deal negotiated on behalf of the US by Brazil and Turkey according to which Iran would have exported its enriched uranium in the hopes of receiving the reactor fuel it had been denied, only to see the Obama administration pull the rug out from under them AFTER Iran had said yes, upsetting the Brazilians and Turks so much they publicized the letter Obama had written to them just a week earlier endorsing the same terms that Iran had agreed to http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_brazil-reveals-obama-letter-in-spat-over-iran-nuclear-deal_211443.html  The Bush administration had started out imposing  an unrealistic and illegal demand called ""Zero Enrichment"" -http://thinkprogress.org/security/2013/10/24/2823381/hawks-enrichment-war-iran/ - which would have required Iran to give up her sovereign right as recognized by the NonProliferation Treaty to be able to make their own reactor fuel (which thanks to US sanctions, Iran was not able to import as usual.) This was a deliberate policy of the Bush admin, to prevent any deal by making demands that no country would accept.  The second Obama admin eventually dropped the zero enrichment demand, and signaled that it is willing to resolve the nuclear issue, which is what we're seeing today. The significance of this is not in the details of the nuclear deal itself, but in that the US and Iran are finding ways to get along rather than continuing towards a conflict.  That's why there are many forces opposed to such a deal and insist that the US and Iran should not be talking but that the US should be attacking Iran instead, including Israel and the proIsraeli lobby in the US which has been pushing for a war for a while now.http://www.uscatholic.org/culture/war-and-peace/2008/06/iran-spam  There are others who say that the US should not listen to the Israelis and should instead ""Go to Iran"" just as Nixon ""went to China"" and decided to open up relations with those countries rather than continue the emnity. http://www.amazon.com/Going-Tehran-America-Islamic-Republic/dp/1250043530  So you see the nuclear issue is not really about nukes but is just a part of a larger political dispute. There are no Iranian nukes just as there were no Iraqi WMDs In reality, Iran's ""capability"" to make nukes is hardly unique -- 40 nations were already capable of quickly making nukes if they wanted to, back 10 years ago. More now, presumably. http://old.seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002041473_nukes21.html  That's because the ""capability"" to make nukes comes with becoming technologically developed, not because these 40 nations want to make nukes. If you listen carefully you'd see that even the US only accuses Iran of ""intending to acquire the capability"" to make nukes, not actually making nukes. There is a significant difference: the capability to make nukes is not illegal. In fACT the NonProliferation Treaty is actually also intended to promote nuclear technology (which has to be shared ""to the fullest extent possible"" and ""without discrimination"")  -- thus having the ""capability"" to make nukes is not a violation of the NPT but actually an inevitable part of following the NPT.Nukes are actually more of a liability than an asset  There's no reason to just assume that Iran wants nukes either. http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ten-reasons-iran-doesnt-want-the-bomb-7802  There's zero evidence of any Iranian nuclear weapons program, ever.   Despite growing international concern about Iran's nuclear program and its regional ambitions, most U.S. intelligence shared with the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency has proved inaccurate, and none has led to significant discoveries inside Iran, diplomats here said. http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Most-U-S-tips-fingering-Iran-false-envoys-2646358.php   According to IAEA Director Elbaradei:   I have been making it very clear that with regard to these alleged studies, we have not seen any use of nuclear material, we have not received any information that Iran has manufactured any part of a nuclear weapon or component. That’s why I say, to present the Iran threat as imminent is hype. http://svaradarajan.blogspot.com/2009/10/elbaradei-interview-language-of-force.html   And   With respect to a recent media report, the IAEA reiterates that it has no concrete proof that there is or has been a nuclear weapon programme in Iran. http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/17/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-sb-idUSTRE58G60W20090917   and   The IAEA is not making any judgment at all whether Iran even had weaponisation studies before because there is a major question of authenticity of the documents. http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article28114.ece   Even the new, US-backed IAEA Director   The incoming head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Friday he did not see any hard evidence Iran was trying to gain the ability to develop nuclear arms. ""I don't see any evidence in IAEA official documents about this,"" Yukiya Amano told Reuters in his first direct comment on Iran's atomic program since his election, when asked whether he believed Tehran was seeking nuclear weapons capability. http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/03/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-exclusive-idUSL312024420090703   and lets remember that Iran has bent over backwards and has actually allowed more inspections than legally required   ""Any country, I think, would be rather reluctant to let international inspectors to go anywhere in a military site,"" Mr. Blix told Al Jazeera English about Parchin in late March. ""In a way, the Iranians have been more open than most other countries would be."" http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/0420/Iran-s-Parchin-complex-Why-are-nuclear-inspectors-so-focused-on-it   Claims that Iran blocked legally-required inspections were denied by even the IAEA http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/05/11/us-iran-nuclear-iaea-idUSKRA15680720070511  So lets see, that's ELBaradei, Blix, and even Amano (who had actually secretly sworn loyalty to the US  http://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/nov/30/iaea-wikileaks)  And actual arms inspectors   Iran has mastered many technologies in the uranium-handling and enrichment areas, such that if they wanted to go ahead, they probably could do it. That would make them a threshold state. We can name any number of other states in the world with the same level of technology and expertise. It's the intent that you have to worry about. We don't see intent to this case.   http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=13286  And 5 European ambassadors to Iran say that too http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/09/iran-nuclear-power-un-threat-peace  And actual nuclear experts http://original.antiwar.com/yousaf-butt/2014/06/18/what-is-the-quality-of-scientific-evidence-against-iran/  Oh and the actual international community also says it http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/india-with-nam-in-slamming-iaea-report-on-iran/  Nonaligned states protest Israeli attacks on IAEA http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/11/22/us-nuclear-iaea-nonaligned-idUSL2187147520071122  The US has been pushing some documents as proof that Iran supposedly engaged in nuclear-related studies (Called the ""Alleged Studies"" by the previous IAEA director, and ""Possible Military Dimensions"" by the new, US-backed IAEA director) until 2003 however the evidence -- to the extent the US has actually let anyone including the IAEA or Iran to see -- has been laughed at/ There have also been a variety of half-baked leaks of ""proof"" of a nuclear weapons program in Iran,  for example the ""AP Graph"" http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-exclusive-graph-suggests-iran-working-bomb  which turned out to be a hoax http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/29/ap-iran-nuclear-program-graph-explanation  as was the general quality of the scientific evidence against Iran http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2012/1205/Flawed-graph-weakens-case-against-Iran-nuclear-program-video  This book is all about that http://www.amazon.com/Manufactured-Crisis-Untold-Story-Nuclear/dp/1935982338"

(but please note my criticism of using that metric in my other post)  B) If you add together a certain group of countries - which I'm not sure how they chose, they add up to 45 percent of population. In those countries, overall generation for renewables is more than nuclear.  It does NOT say that worldwide, more electricity is generated from renewables than from nuclear. Personally I think not including that fact is a bit confusing for the lay reader."
energy,3dhv9d,madronedorf,6,Thu Jul 16 18:20:11 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: True, but may be misleading. If you think wind and solar produce more power than nuclear, you're misinformed (by articles like this!)  Hydro is the worldwide renewable champion.  Biomass generates more electricity than wind and solar in many ""green"" countries.  A few countries are rocking geothermal electricity.  Specifically, the claim is that more electricity is supplied by renewables (wind, solar, geothermal and biomass, not hydro) than nuclear in the following countries:   China   True! 2.2% renewables (lots of geothermal, some biomass) vs 1.8% nuclear. China is ramping up production of both renewables and nuclear.  Japan   True! Green power accounts for something around 3-5% of their power.  Lots of this is biomass being burnt in coal plants. But only because they suspended their nuclear reactor fleet following Fukushima.  These used to provide 25%-30% of their power.  This energy is now supplied by natural gas. Japan is trying to turn their fleet of reactors back online.  India   True! 5% renewables (mostly wind) vs 3.2% nuclear. India is ramping up production of both renewables and nuclear.  Brazil   True! About 4% renewables (almost entirely biomass) vs 2% nuclear.  Brazil is ramping up production of both renewables and nuclear.  Germany   Probably true 17.6% renewables (mostly biomass) vs 17.9% nuclear Germany is ramping up renewables and ramping down nuclear.  Mexico   Not clear Both provide about 2.5% of power. Most renewable power in Mexico comes from geothermal.  The Netherlands   True? So I'm seeing 10-11% renewables, 3-4% nuclear, but I can't get a breakdown of those numbers. It might be that these numbers come from the Netherlands' rather large (16%) total electricity imports? The World Bank suggests biomass might be as much as 4% of their electricity production. Unrelated: why is it always so hard to get numbers about the Netherlands?  Spain   Varies month to month Each of renewables and nuclear produce 20-25% of power. Spain is a wind-power giant, producing almost all of its renewables from wind. It looks like Spain is adding more wind generation and closing nuclear plants.    The other countries listed as having more renewables (with hydro) than nuclear are all true.  Keep in mind though, each of those countries has considerable access to hydro power, and that hydroelectric generation makes up the vast majority (usually more than 90%) of ""renewable power"".    My numbers are mostly from ~2011.  It's hard to get up to date statistics without reading through a huge number of very large energy sector reports.  I've spent a lot of time on this already; if you want sources, google around.  The world bank and wikipedia are two places to get good summaries."

Honestly, everything but drilling the well, completing the well, and building facilities is fairly cheap.  My company only spends $16 a bbl to bring it to the surface and sell it.  But, wells decline in production quickly.  So the result is that revenue shrinks if you don't spend money.  So the way to look at it is you spend a ton of money going to make a ton of money.  If you have to spend more than you project it's worth, you don't spend the money.  That's why rigs are down.  But actually producing from an existing well is cheap.  So you're right about the sunk cost thing.  Oil companies just need the constant revenue to reinvest in their business so the cost to drill it is irrelevant after it's drilled.  You have to produce it."

American and European markets have been impatient with the results, forcing new nuclear plants to require governmental guarantees, which may be an unreliable source of funding.   We'll see if these are initial teething troubles and if sufficient demand overseas can give designers and manufacturers enough breathing room to resolve these issues. I believe Chinese EPR plants are also significantly behind schedule, which suggests the problem may not be a lack of political will. I do not know enough about the UAE and South Korea plants.

Wind power contributes the vast majority of output to achieve the 2020 renewables target, at 18% of total output.  ■ Beyond 2020, low carbon electricity, from a mix of renewables and nuclear, underpins the electrification of heat and transport. Heat pumps and electric vehicles provide an increasing contribution towards meeting the targets over time.  ■ In order to meet the challenges of longterm decarbonisation targets the heat sector requires a move away from gas towards electric heating.  ■ Whilst heat pumps become the largest provider of heat in 2050, there is still an essential role for gas to provide top-up heat.  ■ In the three other scenarios environmental targets are not met on time due to lower prosperity and less green ambition.

Heat flux modeling showed a significant reduction in daytime roof heat flux under the PV array.  a 5.9 kWh m‐2 (or 38%) reduction in annual cooling load. The reduced daily variability in rooftop surface temperature under the PV array reduces thermal stresses on the roof and leads to energy savings

In a province like Quebec, where most electricity is zero-CO2, but heating is done by natural gas, panels on a factory roof may increase greenhouse gas emissions.  It's also interesting to look at global warming effects of white roof vs. black solar panels.  If panels are installed in a place where coal is burnt for electricity then CO2 reduction will outweight increased heating from the dark colour.  If panels are installed in a place where all electricity is from co2-free sources then they will speed up global warming."

But they haven't shut down shale. Not yet anyway. Shale oil companies have proven surprisingly resilient. What Saudi Arabia has accomplished is forced wildcatters to cut way back on new drilling. But shale production is still at very high levels due to the thousands of wells drilled over the past 5 years. And unlike with the super-giant conventional oil fields which require 5-10 years of investment before they start producing, shale oil wells produce within weeks of being drilled & fracked. So the shale industry can resume their rapid growth once again as soon as prices recover.  Essentially what has happened is that Saudi Arabia has given up as the world's swing producer, conceding that role to the American shale oil companies. OPEC, by pumping like there's no tomorrow, relinquished the power to manipulate prices, because now they don't have any excess capacity. The excess oil production capacity now lies with shale producers, and it's subject to market forces rather than the whims of OPEC and the House of Saud.

But part of reason why nuclear power plants stopped being built is because of overbuild.  One of the biggest challenges in power planning is correctly modeling load growth. If you expect high load growth, you are going to want to build a lot of power plants. Load growth can also negate a lot of other problems. Costs go up? Make errors in construction? Well you have more customers/demand that can solve a bit of that.  in the 1970s there was a lot of predicted load growth. It really made sense to build nuclear to meet that demand. But then that demand did not occur. And it makes a lot less economical sense to build nuclear when it is not going to meet new demand, but it is replacing existing demand. It is usually going to be cheaper to supply power with plants already built then it is to supply it with new plants.  So built a lot of nuclear plants, but then realized wait, we don't need new plants. We more then meet demand with what we got. (now in retrospect, global warming and all. yeah would have been good idea to build those plants. Lot easier to meet goals if we were 40 nuclear compared to 20 percent. But well. Hindsight is 20/20)  Look at this chart: http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=2070  Basically you had large increase of capacity from the 50s to the 70s, but then it crashed until about 2000. (Now I'd also argue that the 70s and 80s overbuild tapered over problems with the deregulated model which came into being in the 90s and early aughts, which are now becoming more evident as new plants are needed.)  In addition, one of the biggest problems with the regulated utility model is that both investor owned utilities and big suppliers/construction companies have big incentive to want to build new plants. Why? Because they will get more money from it, via their rate of return."

energy,3dam2a,drzowie,11,Wed Jul 15 21:31:26 2015 UTC,"There are a bunch of answers, because the history of the nuclear industry is rife with underhanded dealing and dissembling.  In particular, starting in the 1970s, public backlash against perceived (and real) government and industry lies, among other things, grew strong enough to drive all three of: safety costs, regulation (the ""ratcheting"" described in the article), and legal obstacles.  The rise in cost was due to a mix of (A) people realizing just how expensive has-to-work-right-the-first-time engineering can get; (B) hyperregulation, in the form of onerous regulatory hurdles; and (C) obstructionism in the form of hyper-expensive eternal lawsuits from activist groups.  (A) is a big deal.  ""Not that big"",  you might think -- people build plenty of other industrial infrastructure on equivalent scales (e.g. chemical processing plants).  But chemical processing plants, refineries, and other industrial equipment generally tolerates far more leakage than do nuclear facilities.  Notwithstanding occasional horrors like the Union Carbide Bhopal disaster, chemical plants generally don't have the same horrific failure modes that nuclear plants do. It turns out to be really hard to specify, contract, and build industrial equipment with a high safety margin.  It requires expert human thought, which is among the most expensive commodities in the world, and also competence throughout an organization.  Homer Simpson is funny because he's based on reality -- but the problem is even deeper than that.  Incompetent organizations simply cannot specify and manage even procurement of major subsystems of industrial projects, without screwing up.  San Onofre (nuclear plant outside of San Diego) just shut down due to faulty design of their new steam system, which led to worrisome crack propagation in manifolds and pipes.  The problem is not limited to nuclear plants (witness the current problems of the Bay Bridge project, which is suffering from poorly-specced bolts that become frangible and weak when exposed to seawater).  But nuclear engineering near population centers exacerbates the problem.    Now, that's not the only problem with construction costs for nuclear plants -- after all, in Europe and elsewhere they're still economical to make.  But in the U.S.:  (B) we have hyperregulation that came in, in the 1970s.  This because of a sort of trifecta of: (i) the efforts of activists (see below); (ii) current events in the late 1970s (Three Mile Island; Love Canal; formation of the Superfund to clean up widespread industrial messes); and (iii) the realization that existing plants had not been built as safely as they could be.  (C) In the 1970s anti-nuclear activists really kicked into high gear and began winning victories against the nuclear industry ""establishment"".  In a highly populist era, nuclear technology had a lot going against it:  it is highly centralized; it is highly technical and therefore inaccessible to most commonly-educated folk; it is related to nuclear weapons, which were the boogeyman of the cold war; it was the subject of coordinate campaigns of government and corporate lies (e.g. ""Atoms for Peace"" really was a cover program to develop a plutonium economy and make it easier to support bomb making, and the 1970s was a time when various horrors of people being lied to about the danger of radiation were coming to the surface -- e.g. the Navajo uranium miners); and the nuclear industry was (and remains) even more dangerous than the chemical industry -- at a time when new chemical disasters were being found and/or happening at about the same rate as the news cycle.   All of that led to a large, justified knee-jerk subculture of mistrust about anything nuclear-related.  That, in turn, meant that suddenly every single opportunity for a lawsuit or some other legal or political obstruction was yet another months- to years-long roadblock in any new construction project.    Even beyond the actual dangers of the power industry, people in the 1970s were keyed up to kill the nuclear industry because they were worried about something that is actually happening today: proliferation of nuclear weapons through the presence of a plutonium economy.  If you don't know about John Aristotle Phillips, you should get his book (""Mushroom"") or watch the movie about him.  During the Carter administration, Phillips, for his physics independent project as a senior at Princeton, learned enough about nuclear physics and nuclear engineering from public sources to produce a viable design for a plutonium bomb.  His work was regarded as a huge wake-up call that fuel reprocessing and/or disposal could lead to terrorists making off with plutonium and building nuclear weapons for ""rogue states"".  (That was lampooned in Back to the Future, BTW).  But it also increased costs further, by immediately killing plans for a reprocessing plant and for a national permanent nuclear waste dump.  Currently, any new nuclear plant has to plan to store every piece of nuclear fuel it ever uses during its design life, indefinitely.  That switch to ""medium-term storage"" of many decades happened in the late 1970s as it became apparent that a permanent waste disposal site would not happen.  tl;dr: the nuclear industry was grossly mismanaged during the cold war, and justified public backlash made it very difficult to develop new plants, starting in about the 1970s."

He was the one who made that phrase into conventional wisdom.  At the time (1978 or so) there was a major national strategy to build a plutonium processing plant to make new nuclear fuel from old fuel rods.  It would separate the reactor poisons and high level waste (fission products) and re-engineer new rods from old - and also produce pure plutonium for making new fuel rods.  Phillips basically  killed that.  (Other places, like England and France, built their own reprocessing facilities anyway...)"

Current EVs tend to use ~150 Wh/kg pouch cells (the ones in Tesla are ~220 Wh/kg cylindrical). The latest pouch cells are around 200 Wh/kg and latest cylindrical are closer to 250 Wh/kg. Therefore, there is a 33% to 67% or so increase in energy density to be had using next generation EVs over current EVs simply by going with the latest cells. That's before car manufacturers decide to put a bigger battery in the vehicle - it's obvious one will fit.  Silicon Anode is getting closer and closer to being ready. Already there are prototypes with 330 Wh/kg although with poor lifecycle characteristics (expect to see them in mobile phones soon). LMR cathodes also present possibilities although they have extremely poor longevity presently. Pair silicon anode and LMR and we have 400 Wh/kg.  ""Current battery technology performs far below its theoretical limits. For example, in the near-term, with existing lithium-ion technology, there is an opportunity to more than double the battery pack energy density (from 100 Wh/kg to 250 Wh/kg) by using new high-capacity cathode materials, higher voltage electrolytes, and high capacity silicon or tinbased intermetallic alloys to replace graphite anodes.

Yet during the past 5 years the chemistry these plants were built for has become obsolete (LGCPI is now producing a newer chemistry in the same factory) and the cost for a Nissan Leaf battery has fallen from ~$18,000/pack to ~$7,000/pack. And Nissan Leaf has already had 2 revisions to the chemistry, same with the Chevy Volt.   All the investment in the Gigafactory is telling us is that Tesla is investing in its current technology batteries. Over the course of the next several years there will likely be several revisions, then expect the factory to be upgraded (and Tesla products) to whatever the latest is in 5-8 years.

With a stationary SOFC you get CHP, but with the PEM for transport it's just the electricity.  However, when you're creating the Hydrogen from Renewables such as Solar or Wind, which have no fuel costs, then the overall efficiency isn't everything. Sail boats are more efficient that motor boats. Yet we still don't use them for transport.  Range, convenience, cost, etc play major roles in transport above and beyond pure efficiency."

The Department of Energy hereby prescribes as its official seal, of which judicial notice shall be taken pursuant to section 654 of the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, 42 U.S.C. 7264, the imprint illustrated below and described as follows:  [Please see PDF for image: EC01OC91.039]  (a)(1) The official seal includes a green shield bisected by a gold-colored lightning bolt, on which is emblazoned a gold-colored symbolic sun, atom, oil derrick, windmill, and dynamo. It is crested by the white head of an eagle, atop a white rope. Both appear on a blue field surrounded by concentric circles in which the name of the agency, in gold, appears on a green background. Detailing is in black.  (2) The colors used in the configuration are dark green, dark blue, gold, black, and white.  (3) The eagle represents the care in planning and the purposefulness of efforts required to respond to the Nation's increasing demands for energy. The sun, atom, oil derrick, windmill, and dynamo serve as representative technologies whose enhanced development can help meet these demands. The rope represents the cohesiveness in the development of the technologies and their link to our future capabilities. The lightning bolt represents the power of the natural forces from which energy is derived and the Nation's challenge in harnessing the forces.  (4) The color scheme is derived from nature, symbolizing both the source of energy and the support of man's existence. The blue field represents air and water, green represents mineral resources and the earth itself, and gold represents the creation of energy in the release of natural forces. By invoking this symbolism, the color scheme represents the Nation's commitment to meet its energy needs in a manner consistent with the preservation of the natural environment."

Geothermal has languished in Australia even though there is a decent resource around the Cooper Basin. They can't get capital from the banks, and CEFC won't go their either because they have strict ROI requirements that won't allow them to (FWIW $10-$20million per hole). ARENA was too small to chip in for project investment, rather they were there to prove the feasibility without a ROI requirement.  I agree with the Government that Wind can stand on it's own two feet now and doesn't need CEFC to address the market failure there, it's sensible to move on when a technology reaches financial maturity. Nevertheless Wind will get the lion share of LRET certificates and continue to develop. Solar thermal and geothermal in Australia are going nowhere if all that is invested in is Wind and Solar PV. Also large scale solar is still included in the recent proposed changes, but it's easier for people to feel empowered and say ""fuck Abbott"" and continue the circlejer rather than properly take the time to assess the proposal."

This plays right into the hands of the Liberals who want Australia to revert to a feudal serfdom, with a handful of knights running the show and a multitude of peasants happy to scrounge starvation wages digging coal out of a pit.  It starts with dismantling any industry other than mining and agriculture and using cheap Chinese labour to dig coal, Chinese ""qualified "" workers and ends with working Australians getting paid $2 per day and getting told to like it.   The CEFC was only going where the banks wouldn't go. Without 20% investment the banks wouldn't have touched it.

It has also been turning a profit.

No it hasn't. I know of one place that is still cranking out poles in South Australia. Absolutist comments require some decent facts to back them up.   The coal industry wants to kill off competition and the liberals want to increase unemployment to decrease wages and increase profits.   Like I said in another comment. Coal is closely linked to the ALP than the Liberal party via the CFMEU. The largest place for unemployment is South Australia that has 8.3% unemployment, that has had an ALP government for 13 years!   The CEFC wont touch geothermal because like you said, it is too risky and doesn't have the ROI.   Every 100% renewable plan either relies on biomass (bad) or geothermal.

The CEFC has been doing a fantastic job getting investment into new projects in Australia. It has also been turning a profit.   Good that it has made technologies financially mature, now to move on and do the rest. Government corporations shouldn't be banks, they need to stimulate the new technology sectors to broaden the economic pie. It's profits need to be reinvested to stimulate more activity.   The Liberals and their spiralling debt, which they have no intention to fix, and would like to just scare us with terrorism, need all the money they can get, yet corruption from the coal industry prevents them.

But even a price on carbon wouldn't save some of these plants:   Exelon Corp., the biggest U.S. owner of nuclear reactors, needs to almost double power prices to keep a New York plant running in a move that promises to show just how far regulators will go to keep uneconomic plants operating.

Especially since these older plants are supposed to be cash cows for the utilities that own them.  I would venture that cheap natural gas is part of the problem and that some of this is due to the fact that natural gas extraction is severely under-regulated.  What this article doesn't say is that renewable energy, especially wind power, also brings down wholesale power prices (the kind nuke plants in liberalized energy markets depend upon).  Since they have no fuel cost, renewable energy plants can underbid any power provider on the grid and they tend to set the marginal electricity rate in areas where they are deployed in sufficient quantity.

I heard a talk a while ago that provided some interesting insights on how California can accommodate an increasing penetration of variable and intermittent generation supplying its grid.  As this article mentions, the current approach relies primarily on using a large number of natural gas peaker plants to provide spinning reserves and regulation capacity. This is both costly for ratepayers and ultimately incompatible with CA's AB32 greenhouse gas policy goals.  Another method of reducing variability that's rarely mentioned is promoting technological and geographic diversity among renewable generators. Although this mitigates the variability of individual generators to a surprisingly high extent, it's not sufficient to guarantee that power can be provided reliably.  Energy storage is probably the most commonly suggested solution proposed when this variability problem is brought up. Although it's certainly promising, cost and scale still remain as hurdles.  Another emerging approach is automated demand response, typically with HVAC systems, refrigerators/freezers, and hot water heaters. This would involve creating smart appliances/building control systems that receive a signal from the utility or ISO/RTO that indicates whether consuming electric power at any given time would stress the grid or could be easily accommodated. This is effectively equivalent to a massive amount of storage capacity, but it only requires a small internet-connected computer chip instead of a huge amount of lithium-ion batteries/flywheels/pumped-hydro facilities."

However, it appears that imports were flat or decreasing in the 80s and 90s, and then began to rise in the late 90s. This matches up with CA's electricity market deregulation.

Because If a pumped water storage project proposal was viable from an economic standpoint (already assuming they have the land on which to create a lake), it would go ahead anyway.

I'm not against this method at all man, its great where it makes sense. But ultimately it's not applicable to most places around the world, especially places with any kind of water shortages.

Here is my comment from when this was posted last time:   This needs some explaining as the publisher for this advertisement is the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and not Coal Miners, per se.  This came out in the 2007 when the Government facing re-election was mulling the idea of Nuclear Power (two large reports came out discussing it's viability). No firm decision was made either way, although activists ensured that they portrayed there was one made, hence ""which electorate will have a nuke"" line came out to spook voters.  This piece of investigative journalism by The Guardian looked at the flow of political donations to both major parties. http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2014/mar/31/australian-political-donations-interactive?CMP=soc_567[1]  The Circular diagram is for the Australian Labor Party. There is a large blue circle for the CFMEU (size of circle indicates donation size), major donor of ALP, leading into that are other large circles that are present Australian Coal companies.  There is a reasonable assumption that the CFMEU ran this campaign along with the ALP to appease their high paying Coal donors.  Aside, it is harder to track these donations as the registers in Australia are not as detailed or comprehensive as those in the US. So hat tip to The Guardian for digging through the pieces."

We now know that the NEM wasn't on the cusp of additional growth in demand like the network entities believed  (or wanted us to believe). Had a major new capital-heavy plant had been commissioned, it would have come online just when the market was so over served, that it was ready to mothball several large coal generation assets. And without a carbon price, the cost of nuclear isn't comparatively attractive. So perhaps if we had kept the carbon tax in play it would have been a great move... But we didn't.

Its actually pretty ridiculous what a panacea fusion would be in the global energy conversation while considering the relatively modest investment we're making to develop it.

""Spent"" fuel rods are nuclear waste for current water reactors mainly because reactors use fuel rods.  Fuel rods contain some portion of fissile materials (usually U-235) and natural uranium (U-238).  The U-235 fissions emits neutrons which normally hit uranium (U-2385) and cause them fission -edit- (or absorb a neutron and change into things like plutonium).  The fission reactions releases heat and breaks nuclear bonds.  This (Fissions and neutron absorptions) causes the uranium to change from uranium to other elements and isotopes.  Some of the resulting materials are good for keeping these types of fission events going and some are not.  The ones that are not are called neutron poisons.  Once the total number of the fission events drops too low, the fuel is considered ""spent"".  The reaction could go on if the neutron poisons were removed and if the fuel rods were not solid holding everything in place.  Typically 96% of the uranium that was originally put in there is still there.    Solid fuel reactors do a terrible job at using all the fuel, but the power released by nuclear reactions is millions of times more powerful than combustion reactions of coal, gas or wood.  Molten salt reactors (/r/MSR) allow for much more of the fuel to be used (fissioned)."

Fast neutron reactors (solid fueled or  fluid fueled) can get up to 30% out without reprocessing (chemical separation of the good fuel from the fission product poisons), and 90% out with reprocessing. Thermal reactors with reprocessing and/ or fluid fuel can get a good fraction of regular uranium waste as well, and do even better if running on a thorium fuel cycle.

Neutrons thermalize, then are absorbed by the next 235."
energy,3cub57,jamessnow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:18:56 2015 UTC,"Fissile U-235 and non-fissile but fissionable and fertile U-238 are both used in the fission process. U-235 is fissionable by thermal (i.e. slow-moving) neutrons. A thermal neutron is one which is moving about the same speed as the atoms around it. Since all atoms vibrate proportionally to their absolute temperature, a thermal neutron has the best opportunity to fission U-235 when it is moving at this same vibrational speed. On the other hand, U-238 is more likely to capture a neutron when the neutron is moving very fast. This U-239 atom will soon decay into plutonium-239, which is another fuel. Pu-239 is a viable fuel and must be accounted for even when a highly enriched uranium fuel is used. Plutonium fissions will dominate the U-235 fissions in some reactors, especially after the initial loading of U-235 is spent. Plutonium is fissionable with both fast and thermal neutrons, which make it ideal for either nuclear reactors or nuclear bombs.  Most reactor designs in existence are thermal reactors and typically use water as a neutron moderator (moderator means that it slows down the neutron to a thermal speed) and as a coolant. But in a fast breeder reactor, some other kind of coolant is used which will not moderate or slow the neutrons down much. This enables fast neutrons to dominate, which can effectively be used to constantly replenish the fuel supply. By merely placing cheap unenriched uranium into such a core, the non-fissionable U-238 will be turned into Pu-239, ""breeding"" fuel.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor#Nuclear_fuel_cycle  What percent of the reactions take place in other isotopes and elements than U-235?"

When you take the fuel out, you are down to around 0.7% u235 and about 0.75% plutonium 239, bred from u-238. The reactor actually runs more on plutonium than uranium for the end of the cycle.

energy,3cub57,Gmanacus,7,Sat Jul 11 16:54:13 2015 UTC,"Such a good question.  There's lots of different kinds of radioactive waste!  Some doesn't even relate to the nuclear power industry.  First you start at the mines (and refineries).  Most of today's nuclear reactors require very specific fuel purities.  To get it you dig up lots of uranium and refine it.  While what's leftover isn't particularly radioactive, but poses a threat as traditional mining waste (it's got chemical stuff like arsenic and lead in it).  Next you get low-level waste from anywhere that's working with nuclear material.  Power plants, hospitals, research areas, wherever.  All material (paper towers, clothing, research implements, anything) that is brought near active nuclear material has a tiny chance of being contaminated.  We treat all of it as a danger; during its useful life its categorized and isolated, later its disposed of carefully.  Generally this means pulverizing or incinerating it, then mixing it with non radioactive material such that any contaminant becomes diffuse enough to be harmless.  Intermediate level waste is generally everything near the nuclear reactor core once it's decommissioned.  This is often concrete, metal cladding, resins, and other construction material.  It is typically shielded and buried according to the expected lifespan of any contaminant.  High-level waste is the stuff everyone is worried about but constitutes a tiny fraction of all nuclear waste.  As /u/jamessnow points out, it's mostly nuclear fuel mixed in with nasty stuff.  This can be refined, separating re-usable fuel and useful nuclear by-products from the waste.  This decreases the total volume of high-level waste.  This is generally tricky, expensive, and hotly contested politically, so it isn't done much.  Depending on the type of reactor you use, you get different amounts and types of nuclear waste.  A fast breeder reactor (with a refinery) can actually destroy most existing high-level waste.  This is complex, but essentially you run most of the waste back through the reactor.  The high neutron flux of the core transmutes (breeds) wastes into fuels, then burns them for power.  Some waste is simply atomically smashed to bits!  The ultimate by-product is considerably less waste by mass and radioactivity.  Thorium-cycle reactors produce different high-level waste than uranium reactors.  A theoretical thorium thermal breeder reactor would produce almost no high-level waste."
energy,3cub57,Hiddencamper,6,Sat Jul 11 16:07:48 2015 UTC,"Spent nuclear fuel consists of the split uranium Atoms. Split Atoms cannot split again and produce energy in a power reactor.  Split atoms have a very high neutron to proton ratio, which causes them to be highly radioactive. You cannot produce power by the heat from this radioactive breakdown, because it is very small compared to the heat necessary to drive a generator.   The energy produced by a nuclear fission reactor comes from splitting atoms (fission). You seem to have a misconception that the energy comes from radiation, this isn't correct. While radiation is involved, it is not the driver behind making electricity with nuclear fuel. It's a byproduct of splitting the atom."

It we went off and wind tripped it wouldn't have been a blackout or anything, we have large import capability and the local peakers can spin up fast but it would probably have been a grid emergency which the grid operator tries to avoid at all costs.   That's my story. Hope it was interesting."
energy,3cug80,Hiddencamper,3,Sat Jul 11 18:34:03 2015 UTC,I assume the grid can't actually force any of the wind to shut down without an emergency.
energy,3cug80,10ebbor10,7,Sun Jul 12 13:17:15 2015 UTC,In a grid emergency the grid can force whatever they want. They start with their load shed contracts and eventually have to start opening lines and forcing systems offline.

energy,3cug80,daedalusesq,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:16:46 2015 UTC,Is there actually a technical reason why wind turbines don't do primary voltage control? Or does your local grid operator not like to make contracts with facilities with less than xx MVAr capacity?
energy,3cug80,MCvarial,6,Sun Jul 12 16:35:03 2015 UTC,"Wind turbines typically use inverters to put power out on the grid. They have limited MVAR capability because of their design. We have, under full load non emergency conditions, a 600 MVAR range, and up to 900 if we go to our exciter's capability limits making us the single largest MVAR source in our region. So the grid prefers to keep us up and loaded even in high voltage/low load conditions because we can keep the region stable on our own."
energy,3cug80,Hiddencamper,2,Sun Jul 12 17:27:15 2015 UTC,They have limited MVAR capability because of their design.   Most turbines I've seen can deliver their full nominal power rating as pure positive/negative reactive power at no load and only a slight derating at full load. Big companies actually now often buy a wind turbine rather than capacitor banks. The only issue I see is centralised control. Or am I overlooking something?
energy,3cug80,MCvarial,3,Sun Jul 12 17:45:02 2015 UTC,"My understanding was that many wind generator designs used switched capacitor banks to generate reactive load and they don't have the range of MVAR capacity we do.   Synchronous systems can produce full MVAR at no load. But induction systems and non synchronous generators cannot. There is probably more going on than that, but that was my understanding."
energy,3cug80,Hiddencamper,3,Sun Jul 12 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"Induction generators do indeed need reactive power to operate so thats where capacitor banks could come in, but thats only if you use them direct online. I haven't seen turbines with a system like that in over 20 years. All turbines now use inverters which have great reactive power capabilities. This is a curve for a 1,5MW Siemens turbine: https://i.imgur.com/mpidjl9.png   Synchronous systems can produce full MVAR at no load.   If they are turning with a minimum steam supply, to cover their own losses. As far as I know big synchronous generators suffer from dangerous vibrations if they start working as a motor. Wind turbines can do it at standstill as long as the inverter is active."
energy,3cug80,MCvarial,4,Sun Jul 12 18:08:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah low load on a synchronous generator is very bad. Reverse power can and will damage a steam turbinegen set, which is why we use reverse power relays for automatic generator trips.   As for wind, the grid was concerned about them tripping off. Which is why they wanted us to stay loaded. That's a good kvar profile you linked."
energy,3cug80,Hiddencamper,2,Sun Jul 12 18:32:52 2015 UTC,"Well if they had contracts with the wind turbine operators they could have delivered some negative reactive power and made your life a lot easier :)   Thanks for your time though, its great to have insights of a reactor guy, your generators make mine look like toys."
energy,3cug80,MCvarial,3,Sun Jul 12 21:06:11 2015 UTC,"They may have already been negative. You get committed to a voltage profile per NERC standards, and if your local bus is going to exceed the standard you are mandated to take efforts to lower it. I do know the grid supervisor told me all capacitor banks have already been taken out of service and the few reactors they have were switched in."

energy,3cug80,MCvarial,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:23:36 2015 UTC,"MVARs don't really travel and wind generators are generally built in remote areas with chicken wire attaching them to the grid. My operating areas highest concern IROL interface is based on voltage collapse instead of total power transfer. At a certain point it doesn't matter how many and what generators are online, or what cap banks are available because the MVARs just can't get there. Your only option is to reduce transfers to prevent a voltage collapse with possible cascading effects.   Whether you increase generation on the far side of the constraint or shed load, the fact is you can't really transfer MVARs and wind farms build a bare minimum for transmission means they aren't really up to the task of voltage control. You need reactive resources at pretty much every substation bus that is going to have high transfers and that is a lot windmills not necessarily distributed in optimal areas."
energy,3cug80,daedalusesq,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:12:47 2015 UTC,More electric cars charging in the middle of the night are going to help alleviate this problem.  And retiring more nuclear plants and replacing them with flexible generation + storage would eliminate it entirely.
energy,3cug80,Hiddencamper,7,Sun Jul 12 16:29:05 2015 UTC,"Let's retire a carbon free generator that supports the grid and employs over 600 people, providing over 100 mil in benefits to the local community and pays over 60% of the county's school district, and replace it with low job wind and solar and battery, use up literally 2000 times the amount of land, kill the local economy, and still need fossil backup.   Real smart idea. Let's do it. Let's raise our carbon output, send jobs overseas and out of state, and challenge grid operations/reliability.   In case you didn't get the message. We were required to remain at full output because the grid was depending on us for reliability. It's not because we weren't flexible, I was ready for a prompt 30% load drop and waiting for a grid order to do so. The real world grid is very different than the ""ideal"" grid every talks about in these studies."
energy,3cug80,Hiddencamper,-1,Sun Jul 12 16:32:42 2015 UTC,"Well, if the plant presents this much difficulty in meshing with a 21st Century grid and generating mix, then its time to go.  Renewable energy and storage provides more jobs per dollar invested anyway.  The land use argument is ridiculous since farming / ranching can still continue on 99% of a wind farm's foot print and we have enough rooftops, parking lots, etc. to power around 1/3 of the USA's energy consumption with solar anyway.  Bringing up the red herring of land use just shows that you haven't looked at things objectively.  And besides, how much land is contained in the exclusion zone around Fukushima?  (and how much more area would that have encompassed if 90% of the fallout from the meltdown hadn't been blown out to sea and hit populated areas like Tokyo instead?) How much land is contaminated with uranium mine tallings and mine drainage?  You can't bring up land use without considering these things if you want to be objective about things."
energy,3cug80,Hiddencamper,4,Sun Jul 12 16:59:23 2015 UTC,"I'd refer you to David mackay's book, sustainable energy - without hot air, and his TED talk where he discusses energy density. For the UK to get all of its energy needs through wind, you would literally need to cover half the country with wind turbines. That's very intrusive.   Going further, nuclear has and always will support more jobs, local and overall, than renewables. That's not even a contest.   Mining for rare earth metals needed for wind turbines is very intensive as well. Per unit of material mined, you get hundreds of times more energy than you do for mining out the materials to make a wind generator.   Fukushima is and always has been over evacuated, and your speculation about the fallout blowing towards Tokyo is just silly. You don't have any study of the effects it would have had and this is just speculation. It also all ignores the massive design, procedural, and regulatory deficiencies that Japan's nuclear industry has had for the last 30 years. There is a reason the last 3 major nuclear accidents (and every major nuclear accident since the mid 80s) has occurred in Japan.   But I digress. I prefer to maintain our existing carbon free nuclear fleet and develop an energy strategy where we appropriately utilize all of our resources to reduce our fossil output.   And finally, our regional grid is challenged because of two reasons. First is subsidies that allow wind to operate for a huge loss and still make money, and second is the fact that these subsidies allowed wind to rapidly expand over a decade before the grid built up to support it (and it's still not finished). This is what happens when you try to rush renewable generation without appropriate grid planning and management.   But that's what I know actually working on this stuff."
energy,3cug80,jamessnow,-1,Sun Jul 12 17:45:46 2015 UTC,"Let's put the land use argument to bed, shall we?  Here's a nuclear plant that has a 4,900 ha footprint to generate 22,179 GWh:  STNP  Shepherd's Flat Wind Farm is 7,800 ha in size and generates 2,000GWh:  Shepherd's Flat  So yes, the nuke plant generates 11x as much energy on 62% as much land.  This means that, just counting the plant footprint, nuclear is about 18x as ""energy dense"" as wind power, not ""2,000 times"".  But I'm sure that being off by a factor of 111 doesn't bother you.  Second, let's unpack this statement:   nuclear has and always will support more jobs, local and overall, than renewables.   The USA has 625,000 renewable energy jobs:  http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2015/01/fact-sheet-renewable-energy-job-numbers.html  Nuclear provides 50,000 operations jobs and 17,500 construction jobs even by the industry's own numbers:  http://www.nei.org/Master-Document-Folder/Backgrounders/Fact-Sheets/Nuclear-Power-Plants-Contribute-Significantly-to-S  So in fact, renewable energy provides 10x as many jobs as the nuclear industry does.  We can delve into suppliers, but with a 10x advantage, I don't think things are going to look any better for you.  And there's No True Scotsman for you every time I bring up an example of nuclear power's failures.  Fukushima had this and that special explanation into why it isn't that bad.  Forget the fact that we were extremely lucky and the wind was blowing the radioactive fallout from the reactors out to sea.  ""Over-evacuated"" is just an opinion on your part...try getting anybody to buy the contaminated land and you'll see how devastating the meltdowns were even with the lucky wind direction on the days when the plants blew up.  If you want to talk about subsidies, what about the Price Anderson Act, nuclear loan guarantees, the Manhattan Project, ""cost recovery"" for plants under construction and a whole host of sweetheart deals the nuclear industry gets but other technologies don't.   allow wind to operate for a huge loss and still make money   Source?  The production tax credit ended last year and we're still building lots of wind capacity, so either you think you're more financially savy than Warren Buffet or you don't know what you're talking about."
energy,3cug80,aguywithagoat,7,Sun Jul 12 18:15:23 2015 UTC,"That's a huge nuclear site. Dresden station is on 386 ha of land and is about 2/3rd the capacity of south Texas. The actual reactor land usage is very small, you're going by the total land owned by the site. Bad comparison.   In terms of jobs per MW, nuclear wins. Your source also discusses every green energy source, not just electricity. Bad comparison.   Fukushima is very different. If you want to call it no true Scotsman that's fine, but there is a reason nuclear accidents aren't happening outside of Japan. Over evacuated is based on radiation standards. There are many areas evacuated with annual dose rates less than what you would get flying internationally a few times a year. That's silly. And if the wind blew to Tokyo is fud on your part.   Price Anderson requires nuclear to have the maximum available insurance coverage, plus maintain their own overage pool. It's the largest liability fund for any energy industry and almost any industry at all. It's not a subsidy but a mandate. But you can interpret it however you want.   Existing nuclear gets no special treatment for being nuclear. New nuclear gets less in subsidies than renewable projects on average. Again on a per MW basis.   But however you want to spin it. Nuclear provides clean energy and has its cost externalities already included in the price, no need for extra storage, buildout, bar compensation, etc if you technically wanted to go full nuclear.   Why not both though. Nuclear plus renewables is the best way to eliminate all fossil output, which should be the ACTUAL goal of environmentalists. But that's my opinion."
energy,3cug80,jamessnow,-5,Sun Jul 12 18:41:12 2015 UTC,"The actual reactor land usage is very small   Like I said, you can still use 99% of the footprint of a wind farm for other purposes from day one while a nuke plant site will take decades to decommission, tying up way more land.  With this in consideration, wind uses way less land.   Your source also discusses every green energy source, not just electricity. Bad comparison.   Nope.  You said:   nuclear has and always will support more jobs, local and overall, than renewables   I was just responding to what you said.   And if the wind blew to Tokyo is fud on your part.   Is it impossible for the wind to blow that direction?  At the very least, we were extremely lucky that the wind was blowing swiftly out to sea on those few days.  If there was no wind, the fallout would have stayed close by and the site might have gotten too contaminated for people to even work there to keep the corium and spent fuel pools from melting down further.  The Price Anderson liability pools are woefully inadequate at $12.6B.  And the max private insurance is a joke at $375M.  With just the slow-motion disaster of Fukushima post-meltdown site management and the decades of decontamination running past the $100B range, the risk pool won't even cover emergency ops at a meltdown site let alone the $100's of billions in liability stemming from contamination spread over even a rural area.  And after a nuclear incident like this, almost every reactor would be shut down for a long period of time, forcing the federal government to pick up the tab since there would be hardly any nuclear-generated electricity to levy higher fees against to pay into the fund.  So yeah, when renewable energy plants can get away with buying insurance that only covers around 1% of the potential liability and the government picks up the rest, then the Price Anderson Act will stop being a subsidy.  Yeah, as long as safety standards are enforced, existing nuclear power isn't really a problem.  New nuclear plants like at Vogtle and VC Summer can fill in holes in areas that don't have great renewable energy resources, but the schedule delays and cost overruns on these projects make me worried that we're seeing the same thing that killed the industry in the 1970's and 1980's.  At the very least, either every new power plant should be able to charge cost recovery to defray borrowing costs or none should to keep things fair.  Other than these attempts to level the playing field, the market can decide which clean energy sources it wants."

energy,3cug80,jamessnow,3,Sun Jul 12 00:14:14 2015 UTC,"Judging from the chart, if the power requirements for spring in Norway do not represent the lowest load (which appears to take place in summer), then even the need to keep the dams flowing to some extent could still maintain Norway's potential to eat up surplus wind reasonably undiminished compared to summer.

energy,3cw5hq,MCvarial,3,Sat Jul 11 21:29:13 2015 UTC,"Mm, no, looks like we've both misread it:   A study published in 2009 showed that the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to the electricity consumed in Switzerland (total: 5.7 millions of tonnes) are seven times higher than the emissions of carbon dioxide due to the electricity produced in Switzerland (total: 0.8 millions of tonnes).[14]  The study also show that the production in Switzerland (64.6 TWh) is similar to the amount of electricity consumed in the country (63.7 TWh).[14] Overall, Switzerland export 7.6 TWh and import 6.8 TWh; but, in terms of emissions of carbon dioxide, Switzerland export ""clean"" electricity causing emissions of 0.1 millions of tonnes of CO2 and import ""dirty"" electricity causing emissions of 5 millions of tonnes of CO2.[14]  The electricity produced in Switzerland generated 14 grammes of CO2 per kilowatt hour. The electricity consumed in Switzerland generated 100 grammes of CO2 per kilowatt hour.   If you take that 5.7 million tonnes of CO2 and divide it by their population of 8 million people, you get ~.7 tonnes per capita.  If you work it out from the 100g CO2/kWh you get about ~.8 tonnes per capita.  So their actual per capita is one eighth my number, and eight times your number.  The very definition of meeting in the middle, I suppose.  At 0.8 tonnes/capita, the IPCC suggests that'll lead to a atmospheric CO2 concentration somewhere just under 450ppmv.  Considering how the rest of the developed world is doing, that's quite good.  I'd still argue that they can (and really should) drive that down to zero."

The problem is that running at full capacity will eventually deplete all the water, so hydro facilities are typically run far below their nameplate capacity. For example, the capacity factor of the Hoover dam is .23 (source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor#Hydroelectric_dam).

Other issues with PHS are that you will completely destroy the lake/downstream ecology with rapid water cycling, not to mention needing to upgrade the turbines to match the power output actually needed to avoid a brown out (need a lot more the 1.8 GW nameplate).

energy,3csz55,jamessnow,6,Fri Jul 10 15:01:55 2015 UTC,"Here's my take, knowing what I know about BWRs and the event that happened.  First and foremost, if DC power wasn't lost at unit 1, it likely would have survived. This would have led to a much longer coping time prior to loss of adequate core cooling (which essentially happened when the tsunami struck). Alternatively, if AC power died before DC did, AND the IC-Isolation Condenser happened to be in service, same thing, the unit would have had a much longer coping time. Similarly, if DC power at unit 2 didn't go away, the potential for core damage at any unit would have drastically decreased. Two major issues in the event were allocation of resources based on perceived threats (spent fuel pools, RCIC with no control power at unit 2) while the actual threats were missed (unit 1 with no ACC - Adequate Core Cooling, unit 3 SRV's not operating, etc), and the early core damage at unit 1 complicating accident response for the entire site.   Going a step further, if Japan kept their EOPs and SAMGs upgraded to the BWR Owners Group standards, if they had a unit 1 simulator with better IC training, if early venting was performed in Japan (is a world wide recommendation), if b.5.b standards were implemented, these all would have reduced the potential damage to the site, maybe significantly.   Unit 1, in my opinion, is the only unit which should have had a core melt given the circumstances. It would have taken many perfect actions early in the event to protect unit 1 (not to say it couldn't have been......just that it was unlikely). Units 2/3/4, should never have had damage. 2 and 3 had core injection for close to 3 days and 1.5 days respectively. There's no reason they should have failed, other than bad execution, poor management, and a number of factors including those I listed above. And in all cases, the containment systems for all units should have remained intact, if properly managed. That's my opinion.  Just my ranting."
energy,3csz55,Hiddencamper,3,Sat Jul 11 03:21:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your comment.  I have a few questions:  1) Did the workers at the plant perform adequately in your opinion?  2) Had the government not interfered, would all the units be contained?  3) Do you disagree with the article on any significant points?"
energy,3csz55,Hiddencamper,4,Sat Jul 11 15:05:47 2015 UTC,"I believe the operators performed to the best of their capabilities given their training and procedures and Japanese regulations. I think the only way the operators could have made the situation better is if the training and procedures were improved, or if they had a very strong leadership/control figure like the Fukushima Daini site had. Remember, Daini was damaged almost as badly as the Daiichi site, yet they were able to restore critical safety functions within the first day and a half, and bring all units to cold shutdown. This was due to leadership, as there were no real differences in procedures or training between the two sites.  The government's main issue, in my opinion, is the regulations and the push to delay releases as long as possible. Many studies have shown that early releases, while there is more noble gas release, if appropriately used can minimize TOTAL releases from the accident. Japan's government chose to try and ensure that nobody in the public gets ANY dose, rather than accepting that a small dose to the public would have protected the containment systems, prevented hydrogen explosions, and would have prevented the long term releases we are seeing today.  Some things in the article I don't agree with: The standby liquid control pumps would not have saved any units. They are low capacity (48 gpm pumps), and if both are running you still need an injection rate of about 200 gpm to prevent vessel breach. The minimum debris retention injection rate (MDRIR) decreases the longer the reactor is shut down, and is the minimum amount of water that must be injected to prevent vessel rupture after a fuel melt, the SLC pumps are not sufficient to make up for at least 3-4 days. Of course any water is better than no water, but SLC isn't there to protect the core from damage, it's there to shut down the reactor. Without some makeup source of water to the SLC tank, you only get about 4000 gallons of water injection. It would have bought some time. (also would have minimized releases to the public, as boron changes the ph of reactor coolant and causes it to be more likely to hold onto iodine and not release it). Based on the damage, I doubt you could have repowered the plant switchgear directly, excluding the one functioning SLC switchgear unit. You could have tried splicing cables directly to ECCS pumps.....but I don't know the ratings on these portable generators. Most portable generators cannot produce 4160V power, which is required to start an ECCS pump, nor can they produce the 1.5MW needed for full load running amps that an ECCS pump uses. The nuclear industry's phase 2 FLEX generators are typically 480V 1/2MW portable generators, the goal being to put small condensate transfer pumps in service or charging water pumps, blowdown the reactor, and slowly reflood with condensate, not to re-power the ECCS.  Overall though, the article is spot on. If venting was performed early, you prevent unit 1's hydrogen explosion, which in turn allows extra time to line up emergency cooling strategies at units 2/3, and containment water addition for unit 1, minimizing the total release and saving units 2/3/4. I don't disagree with the overall discussion in the article, just that specific point about SLC.  Some other thoughts: Hydrogen has gotten very different levels of treatment throughout the years, especially in BWRs. Mark I/II BWR plants had no drywell hydrogen control system. There was hydrogen recombiners in the reactor building (secondary containment), however these were abandoned in many plants as the only time they were 'useful' was for extreme/beyond design basis accidents. The containment systems were later inerted with nitrogen to prevent in containment explosions.   Hydrogen has moved from the event based response procedures to the  Emergency operating procedures to the Severe accident guidlines. The current BWR Owners Group EOPs and SAMGs have gotten rod of the majority of the hydrogen control contingency in the EOPs and moved it to the SAMGs. Right now, if we are in the primary containment EOP, the only actions are to monitor for hydrogen and consider venting if necessary (for BWR/6 plants, use the hydrogen igniters/mixers/recombiners as necessary). The SAMGs contains the explicit directions for how to manage hydrogen, when to vent, when it is NOT safe to vent, different actions to take when you are above or below the deflagaration limit and explosive limits. Japan never implemented the SAMG program, which contains this info, and they never moved to symptom based EOPs, so I don't know for certain what their strategy is. All I know is in the US, with indications of hydrogen in containment in large amounts, we would be venting containment before we hit the LEL for hydrogen so that we would never have a problem, and we would do this regardless of what local or federal government said, because under 10CFR50.54(x) I have the legal leeway to vent and exceed release limits if it is required to protect the plant."

On top of it, net metering is a bit of a morass. I've been wondering if a better plan might be to create an incentivized market for owners to lease rooftop space to utilities. That way the infrastructure itself would remain owned and operated by the utility, removing the issue of unplanned solar deployments destabilizing the grid, and the property owners would get a monthly lease payment at market rates.

Best-case scenario it's a publicly-traded company and the shareholders get an extra $0.02 per share, which only adds up to 'real money' if you're the kind of gargantuan institutional investor who has hundreds of thousands of shares.       But if you install it for free in the homes of poor homeowners, their monthly expenses are substantially reduced -- you've basically paid their power bill up front for the next 10-20 years.  That keeps lower-income homeowners in their homes (instead of foreclosed), raises property values, and puts money in their pockets that they can spend in the local economy.  For a family making $48k and sinking $16k into their mortgage, $100/mo in power savings is a major change in disposable income.    It's not a great move as far as macro energy policy goes, but it's a fantastic piece of stimulus to help ambitious people who are just barely making it as homeowners."

energy,3cpjpw,LordBergamot,3,Thu Jul 9 19:14:53 2015 UTC,"The yieldco structure is not nearly as useful as this author claims.  The cost of equity for a yieldco is typically much higher than the cost of project finance debt and tax equity is not necessarily more expensive given that most of the yieldcos don't have enough taxable income to absorb the tax benefits (tax credits and accelerated depreciation) efficiently.     Many people want to believe that this structure is a yield play equivalent to REITs and MLPs.  In reality, it is distinctly disadvantaged compared to those vehicles as a result of inefficient tax rules they are subject to and the nature of the investments.  Given that the economics of most solar and wind projects are reliant on the tax benefits, to achieve an attractive return you must be able to efficiently use the tax attributes.  If you can't, (as is the case with NRG Yield and others), you have to carry them forward.  From a time value of money perspective this significantly impairs your project returns (to the point that they are less than the cost of equity).  Additionally, and unlike in the case of MLPs and REITs, once your tax benefits have been fully utilized, you are once again subject to double taxation.    Also, unlike real estate or pipelines, energy investments have a significant economic depreciation cost that people tend to overlook.  These investments are based technology that over time becomes obsolete, less productive, and which declines in value.  But rather than plan for this by building up a replacement reserve, these companies continue to distribute nearly every dollar of free cash flow.  This works when capital is cheap because it's easy to go out to the markets and raise more, but as soon investors risk preferences begin to normalize these companies will have a very difficult time maintaining their current growth rates."

Secondly, the figures for roof-top fatalities are a simple model based on figures for general construction activities. Is there any evidence that installing a solar array on an existing roof is as dangerous as general construction? If hundreds of solar installers are dying every year falling off roofs, why hasn't anyone come up with a better number than this back of the envelope exercise?"

The article I posted supplies links that discuss the subject in detail, and suggests many of the same things you do:   Quit putting solar on rooftops. Make roofing less spectacularly dangerous. Simplify rooftop solar installation. Make more plug-and-play power electronics. Increase PV efficiency. Reduce PV factory deaths from heavy metal exposure.   At the end of the day, solar's an extremely safe way to make power.  Each solar watt that displaces a fossil fuel watt saves lives."

The problem convincing people into nuclear is the energy in the fuel is many orders of magnitude greater than traditional fuel and the health/enviro hazards of nuclear is orders of magnitude less than traditional fuels.

Compared to hydrogen and helium, it's a very easy gas to deal with. CO2 in air monitors are everywhere and will alarm at very low levels. The central control room gets all of these alarms and will typically order a muster if there appears to be a CO2 leak. Loss of CO2 monitoring would also require prompt action, generally evacuation of that area pending investigation by people with the right kit. I've only ever heard of CO2 leaks happening from clean systems - leaks of reactor gas would obviously be more serious so the primary circuit is designed to a very high standard. Outside of confined spaces (where the usual precautions are required as for any other gas), it's not too much of a problem. It's heavier than air and hard to detect so definitely a risk with confined spaces. The reactors themselves operate at 40 bar, 650 degrees plus. Circulators run off 5MW+ electric motors. There's essentially zero leakage from the reactor, circulators or gas cleanup system - this would be very hard to achieve with something like hydrogen or helium, but is fine with CO2. I'd personally be much more concerned about CO at a combustion plant (including our aux boilers and diesels) than even very large quantities of CO2, assuming appropriate ventilation and monitoring.

Michigan. On July 26, 1989, five farm workers in one family died after consecutively entering an outdoor manure pit on a farm. The pit measured 20 feet by 24 feet by 10 feet deep. The victims were a 65-year-old male dairy farmer, his two sons (aged 37 and 28 years), a 15-year-old grandson, and a 63-year-old nephew. The index victim, the 37-year-old son, initially entered the pit by ladder to replace a shear pin on an agitator shaft. While attempting to climb out of the pit, he was overcome and fell to the bottom of the pit. The grandson then entered the pit to attempt rescue. He, too, was overcome and collapsed.  One by one, the nephew, the younger son, and the dairy farmer entered the pit in attempts to rescue the others, were overcome by lack of oxygen, and collapsed. A carpet installer working at the farm then entered the pit as a rescuer and was overcome; however, he was rescued by his assistant and subsequently recovered. Finally, the owner of a nearby business arrived with two additional workers and, using a rope, extricated the five victims from the pit. When paramedics arrived, they began cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The nephew was pronounced dead at the scene, and the other four victims were transported to the emergency room of a nearby hospital. The dairy farmer and his younger son were pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital; the 37-year-old son died 1 hour after reaching the emergency room. The grandson was transferred by helicopter to a major trauma center but died within 6 hours of his removal from the pit. For the four older victims, the medical examiner attributed the cause of death to methane asphyxia. Assignment of the official cause of death for the grandson awaits completion of the autopsy report.

energy,3cju6u,jamessnow,4,Thu Jul 9 01:37:39 2015 UTC,"What I mean is, faced with a big decrease in it's power generation ability following Fukushima (apparently they scaled back other nuclear production too?), the Japanese government had to react and increase supply quickly, so they fired up their coal plants more intensely, or possibly brought dormant ones online. In the meantime, they also are clearly supporting Solar, in order to increase production. I'm also pretty sure that the Japanese government doesn't deny that global warming is a thing, right? So I'm sure that their plan is to increase renewables, and eventually decrease their fossil fueled plants. But in the very short term they had to bring those plants online to compensate for the reduction of nuclear power.    In other words: The point that their emissions increased, doesn't imply anything about the government's plans or the country's direction going forward, it can be explained by the fallout from Fukushima. (pun intended ;) )  Edit2: Also I don't know anything about the Japanese government / energy ministry structure or their actual policies. But it doesn't really matter - solar is becoming so cheap that most future new energy generation will eventually be dominated by solar. Plus even if a government is backwards, the population is often clamoring for / driving change themselves, e.g. installing solar anyway."

For the real costs we have two giant First Solar projects at Topaz and SunPower just on line this year at $5 a peak watt, financed by Warren Buffet at a 15% ROR on his investment to cover the immense risk the project has of having its subsidies cut off as has happened numerous times when rather silly pro solar/wind governments get dumped by fed up taxpayers.  Google ""solar-15-percent-returns-lure-investments-from-google-to-buffett""  Adding that in gives a LCOE to these projects of close to 50 cents a kwh.  Keep in mind as well that these projects were all built with First Solar panels which according to the company have cost around 80 cents a watt peak for the last few years. Obviously the civil's, permitting and other materials/ labor are adding up, to get the the $5 a peak watt number.  Finally the Ontario Auditor General has estimated that cost of wind power subsidies for 5 times sized transmission facilities, gas backup and surplus dumping adds a further 35 cents a kwh to the cost of wind. Solar would of course be similar.  Meanwhile the cost of building N of kind nukes like Koreas AP1400 now on time in 4 years and on budget at under $4/GW in ultra high cost UAE, is under 3 cents a kwh all in for public power, while the FOAK of the AP1000 is a bit over $5 Watt with enormous legislative roadblocks in a US that has forgotten how to build things with concrete working out to a little under 5 cents a kwh for TVA or Energy Northwest."

So since you're too cowardly to provide an actual link, I'll do it for you:  bloomberg article  How hard is looking up reddit formatting, sethy?  C'mon, man!  And you show how ignorant you are by conflating investor returns with the price per kWh for solar energy.  Seriously, the reason you don't provide a direct link to the article is because it completely disproves the points you're trying to make.  Do you think we're that stupid?   Buffett’s MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. agreed to buy the Topaz Solar Farm in California from First Solar Inc. on Dec. 7. The project’s development budget is estimated at $2.4 billion and it may generate a 16.3 percent return on investment by selling power to PG&E Corp. at about $150 a megawatt-hour, through a 25-year contract, according to New Energy Finance calculations.   So it generates a 16.3% return by selling power AT $0.15 per kWh.  You don't add on to that return, just pulling made-up numbers out of whatever orifice you want!  It just doesn't work that way.  And that was when these solar farms cost $4.54 a watt to install, back in 2012 when the article was written.  Now we're getting prices, real contract prices, for solar energy at $0.0387 a kWh like the op article says.  Again, provide a source for your silly claims about Ontario wind power, which are completely unrelated to this discussion, but are probably included just as a ""get off my lawn"" type of complaint against clean energy in general.  And if you can build a nuke plant for $4/GW, you've invented something even better than Mr. Fusion!!!  Try a few orders of magnitude higher, buddy!  But alas, even this is not correct.  The cost to build the reactors starts at $30B plus debt charges:  bloomberg article  That comes out to $5.36 per watt, not $4/GW, or $4 per watt like I think you were trying to say, so your cost estimate is already 35% too low.  Then the people financing this debt will want a return on their investment, so who knows how much interest this debt will accrue.  And since we're already 4 years after construction started on the first reactor and its nowhere near finished, its safe to assume this project will probably have schedule delays just like all the other reactors being built, so we'll see that debt charge go higher and higher!

energy,3cjj3p,Barney21,0,Thu Jul 9 00:40:14 2015 UTC,"The guy you're discussing with has it right. Baseload defines a type of power plant - not the demand for power.  It goes like this:  Baseload powerplants are cheap to run, but inflexible. They are effectively coal and nuclear plants. Inflexible means they cannot change their output quickly or at all, and they need to be running close to their maximum capacity to be profitable/efficient. They also take a long time (days or weeks) to startup and shut down.  Because for so long, coal (and nuclear) defined general power generation technology, baseload became shorthand for the percentage of these kinds of power plants you had in your generation mix. They actually provide more than the minimum demand, because otherwise they would provide too little power to be profitable. Because they take so long to change power output, or startup/shut down, you need to define a 'static minimum' of supply. This is baseload.  When demand rises above the baseload capacity, the additional power is generated by peak or medium load power plants. These are much more flexible, can startup/shut down very quickly, but are more expensive to run. Typically these are hydro and gas generators.  When demand drops below the baseload capacity, power is used to heat water, pump water, or dumped into the ground (""burning worms""). It's wasted.   So what happens in a solar/wind mix? They're both variable - so you can't count on a specific output at any one time. But with a grid at a state or national level, you can define an average available capacity. It's always sunny and windy somewhere, and over a large enough area it averages out somewhat. When there's excess capacity, then they'll do the same thing that the baseload power stations do - heat water, pump water, or burn worms. When there's not enough capacity, they'll do the same thing that happens with baseload power stations - supplement through gas and hydro.  The question is what mix is required, and can the 'average available capacity' make solar and wind generators profitable. A few things like storage and higher efficiency solar help financially and with balancing the mix of generation. But as seen in Germany, South Australia, and a few other places recently, in menay places there's already sufficient renewables to take up the slack when traditional baseload power is removed from the grid.  Baseload isn't a fundamental requirement of the demand side to make things work. It's a way of classifying a type of power plant, and isn't necessarily relevant in a mix dominated by renewables."
energy,3cjj3p,min0nim,0,Thu Jul 9 01:56:29 2015 UTC,"More correctly it would be plant that is slow to turn on, lacks the ability to dramatically change its output and usually also cheaper to run per kwh.

In Washington State, WPPSS did something very similar when it cancelled 2 nuclear plants whose completion cost hit $24B and could have kept going.  Its customers are still paying for that mess.  And even with new reactors, like the units going up at Vogtle and VC Summer, utility customers are getting charged for these plants before they crank out their first kWh.  If the plants are abandoned (a distinct possibility considering how many reactor builds were abandoned due to ballooning costs in the 70's and 80's), the utility customers don't get their money back.  This effectively offloads a lot of the financial risk from the utility and onto their customers.  And if renewable energy was able to pre-charge utility customers like this, it would be an even sweeter deal than the feed-in tariffs in Germany, since these at least only apply to actual electricity production.  How come nuclear gets such favorable treatment?  And you call solar power generated during peak usage times of the day and year ""crappy""?  Do you know about this thing called an inverter?  How about a transformer?  Do you even know what you're talking about?"

Ontario's nuke reactors all in were running all in at a cost of 2.7 cent a kwh at the time the stranded debt bull was originated by a Fascist politician, in an effort to unload public assets to cronies at fire sale prices. The utility had no issues with any liability.  WPPSS cancellation costs are included in the current costs of the Columbia Generating Station which Energy Northwest tells us come to 4.5 cents a kwh - cheaper than any alternative available.  Actually elected regulators find that public public contributions to Vogtle and Summer will save their customers pennys a kwh over the life of the plants. Cancellations in the 70's and 80's were due to American traitor Jimmy Carter selling out to Big Coal, placing Greenies in charge of  the NRC, thereby murdering a million Americans with their new coal plants.  No so renewable energy, already 100% subsidized, actually gets paid in advance for all its projected supports.  Our always illiterate Big Oil spokesperson, has been told numerous times that solar power peaks at noon while demand peaks in the early evening hours, making solar worthless for peak shaving."

There is no way you can have a sustainable business model by putting up loss leaders all the time, especially for a publicly-traded company.    As for the ""distributer[sic]"", how do they require ""backups"" when solar is just another source on a grid that was supplying every load before the solar plant hooked up to it?  This is what I don't get about the claim that solar needs ""backup"", since all the power company does is throttle back expensive peaker plants to accommodate solar, especially in the hot days of summer when it produces the most.  I did a search for ""electric grid overburden"" and closest thing I could find was about high electricity demand ""overburdening"" the grid.  What do you mean exactly by this?  Smoothing is another moot point you bring up.  Solar PV inverters closely match the voltage on the grid and solar itself is a great way to combat voltage sag during the hot summer days, again when it is producing the most.  Inverters also give off very ""clean"" waveforms, so they help improve the quality of grid electricity too.  Risk?  The power company just agreed to pay 3.87 cents per kWh for 20 years.  All the risk is on First Solar to make sure the plant produces in line with expectations.  If they can't produce, the utility doesn't pay.  Every power source has transmission losses.  While this solar plant is out in the desert, solar in general can be located much closer to load centers than polluting fossil plants, hydro and of course, nobody wants a nuclear plant in their backyard, so solar is better suited than a lot of other technologies."

The solar plant can't be depended upon to supply daily loads so it must be backed up to 100% capacity at all times with peaker plant. No plant and little if any fuel costs are saved over an all combined cycle alternative skipping the solar altogether. Normal fossil or nuclear generating resources are handled with a single digit percentage of gas peaker or hydro plant.  Actually folks that live in the vicinity of nuke plants support new nukes at the 85% level, while there are massive protests again the total destruction of vast areas of desert ecosystems by solar farms.

Unsubsidized utility-scale solar in the super sunny desert Southwest will fall to around $60/MWh in the next decade. Add a tens of hours of storage to that and you'll increase the cost to the tune of double or triple, let's call it double. That gives you $120/MWh. One day new natural gas will cost that much, but not for a long, long time.

No.  As for using your EV battery for your house, that assumes you get home with enough charge to power your house all night (and a whole raft of other assumptions).

The way our wholesale markets work is that the different generators bid onto the market at the price they can produce at.  Wind and solar are near 0 since they have no fuel costs and always end up being able to sell their electricity because the marginal cost of fossil fuels is larger.    This kind of news isn't bad for our grid, it just means that we need to plan ahead and be ready to increase generation fast when the sun goes down.   It also creates bigger and bigger market incentives for storage because the prices of electricity will be more and more divergent as solar adoption goes up and peak loads do not shift temporally."

Even though we do not use automatic load control features and only make manual power changes, if a feed pump trips the automatic control system will lower reactor power from 100% to 60% in about 5 seconds so that we don't trip on low level.   It is completely possible to do rapid load following with nuclear if you tweak your core design and operating procedures for it. The only reason we don't is because it is currently more economical for the majority of plants to run at full power all the time.   Columbia generating station does regularly load follow in the summer time, making as much as 40% power swings down and up throughout the day."
energy,3cjj3p,Hiddencamper,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:42:18 2015 UTC,The only reason we don't is because it is currently more economical for the majority of plants to run at full power all the time.   This confuses me.  The grid needs some amount of load following.  It stands to reason that they will pay for it.  What's that price per kWh (relative to wholesale energy prices per kWh)?  I would figure it's at a premium.  Why not?
energy,3cjj3p,Gmanacus,2,Thu Jul 9 13:26:44 2015 UTC,"Nuclear's variable (fuel) costs are low, and as a result you don't get any savings lowering output. So nuclear maximizes its revenue by running at full power except when it needs to lower for grid safety/stability.   Running a nuke at reduced load isn't economical"
energy,3cjj3p,Hiddencamper,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:11:13 2015 UTC,"Let me rephrase.  What's the dollar value (to the grid) to stop producing power?  If nobody wants to turn off their gener... right.  I get it.  The market will find an equilibrium.  During overproduction the wholesale price of electricity will simply decline until someone can't make a buck, and turns off their power.  Nuclear will budge last, and simply have to eat the reduced price per watt."
energy,3cjj3p,Gmanacus,3,Thu Jul 9 16:38:41 2015 UTC,"Double response: if generators don't come off on dropping prices, the prices start dropping faster and going negative. We see this in my plant when we have high wind conditions and grid transmission issues. The wind doesn't come off because they can keep collecting the subsidy if prices are negative."
energy,3cjj3p,Hiddencamper,2,Thu Jul 9 17:56:15 2015 UTC,Nuclear usually pays the grid to get priority for transmission. That means the grid will be forced to tell other units including Wind to shutdown.

energy,3cjj3p,jamessnow,0,Wed Jul 8 15:54:03 2015 UTC,"You pay what the utility pays for the electricity + transmission + distribution + grid maintenance + guaranteed profit just like with any other electricity source.  However, solar's generation cost is very predictable over the long-term while fossil plants are mostly at the mercy of fuel prices.  Nuclear plants have also been having a hard time staying profitable after incidents like San Onofre, Crystal River and the closing of Vermont Yankee illustrate."

If fossil fuel prices were too high, solar and wind would be uncompetitive."
energy,3cjj3p,jamessnow,2,Wed Jul 8 20:26:06 2015 UTC,"Now you're just not making any sense.  We're talking about what the utility customer pays for electricity.  Since solar has zero fuel cost, it will sell to the grid whenever it can, and this plant will sell at 3.87 cents per kWh, plain and simple.  While old coal plants may be able to beat this figure, it is simply one of the lowest cost for NEW power plants, so don't fret about your electricity rate if you live in Nevada or other places that are putting in a lot of solar.  And if fossil fuel prices were too high, solar and wind (how did this get into a discussion of solar power???) would be MORE competitive since they'd be able to undercut fossils even more, making them a more attractive investment.  Not following your argument on this one."

If you had to choose between 100% nuclear and 100% renewables, the 100% nuclear option is both more economical and sustainable.

Costs for nuclear are generally going up while costs for solar wind and storage are going down.

energy,3cmahs,arjun10,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:39:21 2015 UTC,"NEW YORK—U. S. oil prices fell for a fifth straight session Wednesday after weekly inventory data showed an unexpected increase in crude supplies.  Commercial crude-oil stockpiles rose by 400,000 barrels in the week ended July 3, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. Analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a drop of 1 million barrels. Supplies usually decline in the summer as refineries process more crude oil into gasoline and other fuels.  Crude inventories starting shrinking in April after hitting a record high, boosting prices, but the last two reports have surprised the market by showing stockpile builds.  “This puts some water on the fire,” said Donald Morton, senior vice president at Herbert J. Sims & Co., who oversees an energy-trading desk.  Light, sweet crude settled down 68 cents, or 1.3%, at $51.65 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement since April 10. Brent, the global benchmark, rose 20 cents, or 0.4%, to $57.05 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.  Prices slumped earlier in the week on concerns about growing crude production in the U.S. and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and worries that an economic crisis in Greece and the stock-market selloff in China could slow economic growth and weaken global oil demand. Ongoing negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program, which could lead to a lifting of sanctions on Iranian crude exports, added to the uncertainty.  The EIA also reported that gasoline stockpiles rose 1.2 million barrels, as demand fell from the prior week. Analysts had predicted inventories would be unchanged in the week.  Strong gasoline consumption has been an important factor buoying prices in recent weeks amid ongoing concerns about a global glut of crude.  “Gasoline was serving as the last leg of support,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. “Those demand checkpoints have come undone a little bit on this report, so this would imply that you may see a little bit of a pullback” in price, he said.  Gasoline futures slipped on the report but later recovered, settling up 4.96 cents, or 2.5%, at $1.999 a gallon. The latest report “might be a worry, but the demand so far has been very, very strong,” said Bob Christensen, managing director at Imperial Capital LLC.  Diesel futures gained 0.39 cent, or 0.2%, to $1.7152 a gallon.  While macroeconomic events have driven moves in the oil market in recent days, new data due Friday could refocus traders on supply and demand. The International Energy Agency’s closely watched monthly report is scheduled to be released, along with fresh data on the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S."

Since solar is distributed, it can be spread widely where needed and its has a high covariance with air conditioning load. Multi story buildings have a lot of A/C load and any solar will make a dent in peak load requirements. Reducing peak load not only reduces energy usage, but reduces grid strain, and how often peaker power units have to be used. Those peaker units are not only expensive per kwhr, but also have more emissions.  With the area being limited, this program is less likely to overbuild solar to the point of reversing the peak.  It won't 'run the meter backwards', but you really don't want feature system wide."

What I'm wondering is what's the relative utility of urban rooftop PV and green rooftops?  Does anyone have a study on this?

It might be that green rooves cut energy consumption by more than solar rooves can generate.)"

Nuclear is so expensive, especially compared to wind and solar, that it will cannibalize investment in cheaper alternatives if we try to build even more than a few reactors.  Radioactive Waste - There still isn't a viable plan to deal with it and the government is paying the nuclear industry a billion dollars a year to sit on this stuff until we can figure out a solution.  And don't even start with the claim that commercial thorium reactors can burn nuclear waste because these reactors exist only on paper and are no sure bet.

If you try to use wind/solar alone, you have to deal with overproduction, storage, smart grids, and long-distance transmission, all of which add a lot to the cost. A couple years ago a study of one section of the U.S. grid found the cheapest way to go 99% wind/solar would be to build enough to overproduce energy by a factor of three, on average, and add a little storage on top of that.  In some areas hydro can handle the backup role, but hydro is geographically limited and we can't add much more of it.

That's quite some risk there for any would-be investor.   A couple years ago a study of one section of the U.S. grid found the cheapest way to go 99% wind/solar would be to build enough to overproduce energy by a factor of three, on average, and add a little storage on top of that.   You don't need a study for that. ;) The 80/20 solution is quite obvious. I did it once for a domestic installation (not with a factor of three, but it helped anyway). And with PV costs falling by 4-5% per year, in 10-20 years, this will be a no-brainer. That's probably why utilities are so wary of committing to any conventional large long-term installations these days."

I'm quite convinced that fuel cells are the losing team because of this article (scroll to the part about hydrogen cars):   http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html  From that article:  Among many reasons hydrogen cars seem inferior to EVs, here are four:  1) Hydrogen cars seem beholden to natural gas, a fossil fuel, in order to extract the hydrogen fuel, while electric cars get cleaner over time as electricity production gets cleaner.  2) When it comes to energy density, driving range, and cost, the best case scenario for hydrogen cells is similar to where EV batteries are now, and EV batteries will get better with time.  3) Hydrogen is a somewhat dangerous and difficult-to-handle substance that’s a nightmare compared to the simple wall-outlet electricity EVs use.  4) Down the road, when the norm is to charge the car up in your garage, it’s going to seem primitive to have to go to a station to fuel up.  In an email exchange I had with Musk about hydrogen cars, he explained it like this:  If you take electricity coming from a solar panel and charge a battery, you can get ~90% efficiency. Simple and cheap. Instead, if you use that electricity to split water, separate the hydrogen with extreme purity, pressurize it to crazy levels (or, even worse, liquefy), transfer it to a giant (even in liquid form) hydrogen storage tank in the car and then recombine it with oxygen to generate electricity, you would be lucky to get ~20% efficiency. Expensive, complex, bulky and super inefficient. It loses on every dimension, including refuel time when pack swap is factored in.   Cost is bad for fuel cells, but that is only one of many bad dimensions. If fuel cells were in any way better than lithium batteries, they would at least be used in satellites, some of which cost over $500 million. They are not."

energy,3cg3g3,lifejustice,7,Wed Jul 8 06:15:00 2015 UTC,"Fuel Cell Engineer, here.  I just want to comment on a few of your points.  1) Hydrogen production is not beholden to any given material, except those that contain Hydrogen.  I am not in the automotive market, but I can say that there are many different ways of creating hydrogen.  In the market that I am in, we don't use natural gas or electrolysis.    ...You also have to remember that here in the USA, we have a rock-solid power grid.  We can do anything with it.  We are rockstars.  In many places in the world, including the most populated places (India, China), the power grid can go out up to 10 times a day, if it comes on at all.  Grids are also privately owned.  They are not Federal.  BEV's are not options in these environments.  These places have been very happy with the trains, busses, and utility grids that we have set up for them that puts ZERO strain on the existing grid.  2)People in the automotive industry always see this as a boxing match.  There will not be a winner and a loser.  There are options provided for different regions.  H2 vehicle doesn't make sense to you?  Then don't buy one...but remember...there are places in the world where a BEV makes zero sense to them over H2.  They are options:  Not in a battle.  3) I would like to know more about this.  We have historically had more stored hydrogen on our facility than most people could imagine.  We have been doing so for 30 years.  In the absence of a flame, Compressed H2 is no more dangerous than compressed 02.  It is not combustive (a flame won't generate from within) and flames will not live inside an H2 environment (There is no 02 for a flame to live).  In order for H2 to be dangerous, there has to be pressurization AND a flame AND O2 present.  For some fun facts:  Crash-tests are actually showing H2 to be safer than batteries.  As long as the nozzle is facing up (H2 is extremely bouyant) and not under the passengers, it has had less affects than other fuel mediums.  It burns quick and loud (Boom) and makes a giant flame...but it only lasts for a split second.  outside of the escape channel, there is minimal damage to the vehicle.  When Lithium or other fuels burn, they burn for several minutes and engulf the vehicle as well as the passenger compartment in flames.  We reform our H2 onsite only as it is needed.  There is no stored H2 in our systems.  4)  Many places in the world do not have this luxury.  it is time to think globally.  The Vast majority of the world does not know what a private garage means.    It is important to note that Elon Musk is a business man.  He is a damn good one, but that is all he is.  His models of H2 development and fuel cell useage are over 20 years old.  They are just as outdated as a 20 year old PC.  He is more than happy to compare his technology with a 20 year old model of a ""competitors"" (Which we have never seen ourselves as such).  He can keep using the Electrolysis model to shame H2, but it doesn't hurt any of us, because we have evolved far and away from that model.  It is time to roll up the 25 year-old oil-lobbyist propaganda and put it away.  If you are going to compare efficiencies, you have to compare apples to apples.  Electricity doesn't just appear in a battery, just as Hydrogen doesn't just appear in a fuel cell.  There are MAJOR efficiency losses across our grid that also include environmental and economic recovery that is still taking place.  Our grid is not a magical wonder.  As a Power systems Engineer, I can tell you this:  There is no magic pill.  Fuel Cells do cost money:  The reason being is because we do not have many partners.  You have to remember that BEV's would not exist right now without cell phones.  Cell phones are the enabling technology for creating lithium batteries for cars. ...And as far as satellites...fuel cells are used on every single space mission."

But judging from the speed of progress in the FCEV field, those places where FCEVs make more sense will be very rare in the next three or four decades at least. It simply makes much less sense for any prospective business to focus on them.   3) We have historically had more stored hydrogen on our facility than most people could imagine ... There is no stored H2 in our systems.   Amazing power of double-think!   We have been doing so for 30 years. In the absence of a flame, Compressed H2 is no more dangerous than compressed 02.

And yet, the US military tried hydrogen for high-performance airplanes in Project Suntan and eventually dismissed the idea as expensive and dangerous... I wouldn't have illusions about such technology in hands of millions of people.   4) Many places in the world do not have this luxury. it is time to think globally. The Vast majority of the world does not know what a private garage means.    You consider a wall plug ""a luxury"", and despite that, most places which are actually likely to have prospective customers for electric cars (which are more expensive) in the first place (such as Norway) do happen to have ample wall plugs. What they generally don't happen to have is the actual luxury of having (the non-existent) ""civilian"" hydrogen infrastructure that nobody else besides the odd FCEV owner would need, even in the developed world.   And that's probably where Musk is coming from: unless overall EV penetration gets seriously high, his customers will be much less likely to have access to a hydrogen tank than to electricity. And even in places where there's neither wall plugs nor hydrogen stations at the moment, the wall plugs will come first because light bulbs and computers and washing machines kind of tend to not run on hydrogen (at least they didn't the last time I checked).  Not to mention that BEVs and his domestic solar business (or anyone's solar business) work together much better than fuel cell vehicles:   BEVs can intermittently consume extra power from the renewable grid when it's available at very low costs, to compensate for any oversupply. (They can actually do that at pretty high power levels.) FCEVs can't. BEVs can serve as an optional reserve for either the grid or the vehicle owner when renewables aren't available. (They can actually do that at pretty high power levels, too.) FCEVs can't. BEVs use the same technology as domestic power storage units or utility power storage units. FCEVs don't, and having two technologically entirely different lines of products would make very little sense from the economies of scale perspective, making both of them more expensive.   Etc. Etc. So basically, the suggestion that Tesla would be better off building FCEVs would bring them enormous complications. But at least, on the plus side, FCEVs would only solve like 25% of their overall vehicular and stationary goals...hey, wait a minute!   His models of H2 development and fuel cell useage are over 20 years old. They are just as outdated as a 20 year old PC. He is more than happy to compare his technology with a 20 year old model of a ""competitors"" (Which we have never seen ourselves as such). He can keep using the Electrolysis model to shame H2, but it doesn't hurt any of us, because we have evolved far and away from that model.   You should be a politician. ""Outdated..."" ""Evolved away..."" When did the laws of physics change and hydrogen started growing on trees?   It is time to roll up the 25 year-old oil-lobbyist propaganda and put it away.   That's actually exactly the thing that Tesla does: there's no hydrocarbons that have to be involved in powering BEVs. The oil lobbyist propaganda says that what Musk is doing is a bad idea.   ...And as far as satellites...fuel cells are used on every single space mission.   I don't think so. Apollo last flew in 1975 and the Shuttle retired in 2011."

Lithium ion is like the tallest midget in room. There's no alternative so we put up with it.   The only reason Panasonic is putting its money into that project is because they do not foresee any meaningful competition anytime soon.   As for the cows, well, methane can be harvested from a whole lot of sources. And fuel cells eliminate combustion, which OCGTs don't.

Having said that, battery powered cars work right now with the existing infrastructure quite fine, which makes them much more practical even before the penetration of EVs increases very significantly.  I did once consider a BEV with a fuel-cell-based range extender, though. It could be an option that not everyone would buy (or need) that would make the range of BEVs large enough for all people's needs without major discomfort while keeping the nation-wide average energy efficiency of driving close to battery efficiency. The best of both worlds?   If fuel cells were in any way better than lithium batteries, they would at least be used in satellites, some of which cost over $500 million.   That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. At best, flow batteries would make sense for satellites, but unidirectional fuel cells couldn't possibly power satellites without regular fuel deliveries."

It will be up to the Agency to decide (as always, within the limits of reasonable interpretation) how to account for cost.    Agency has a lot of discretion in deciding how to do cost-benefit. Although co-benefits (ancillary) are very contentious, SCOTUS did not rule on them. Given that it was a 5-4 decision, its certainly reasonable to expect the narrow ruling means that a wider one did not have the votes.  Again the DC Circuit rule 2-1 for EPA initially. Its highly likely that they (the two) are going to be fine with co-benefits. So they approve the change. Suppose it goes back to the courts - it will take at least another 2 years to get SCOTUS to issue an opinion. Most likely the rule will stay in effect during those 2 years.

Can they run a modern, wealthy state on their power infrastructure?  Unfortunately, I'm having trouble finding that number (or a projection of it).    To try an put this in context, consider France.  They spent about 30 years rolling out nuclear, and consequently emit 370 MTCO2 in 2013.  That's half Germany's self-stylized ambitious goal, already realized.

It is likely by then that the world’s population will be twice as large, and more of it industrialised (and therefore oil dependent).   And by the year 2090 the sky will be rainbow colored.  Who needs data and actual projection when you can just baselessly state facts so far out in the future.   There is an ongoing debate between ‘peak oil’ theorists, who believe that we have already passed the point of maximum production, and oil companies who state that new technologies will extend the life of oil well beyond estimates.   We produce more oil than we ever have in history.  So that should end the debate over whether we have already reached peak oil.  And whatever peak we are reaching now is obviously demand driven - not supply.  That's why prices are low.   What is clear is that oil is getting harder to find and extract, and this is reflected in rising prices. A barrel that cost $10 in 1998 and $64 in 2007 today costs $135. Economists are predicting that the $200 ceiling will be broached before the end of the year.   Quite possibly the most ill-informed ""fact"" I've ever heard.  And seriously, how can oil tanking to $50 a barrel and simultaneously surpass $200 a bbl.  That's actually ridiculous.  Not to mention the obvious lack of understanding the oil companies don't set the price that they sell it at...  Traders do.  So when demand surpasses supply oil prices go up.  When supply surpasses demand oil prices go down.  So when oil is $50 a bbl oil companies spend less money to produce oil and as a result produce less quantity of oil...  And when it's $100 they spend more and therefore produce more.  They don't sit at Walmart with bbls of oil with $200 price tags because it's so expensive to produce the oil.  I could go on and on at how bad this person is at economics, but I'd just be wasting my time.  I can't believe people actually believe this.   The knock-on effects are many, including a rise in the cost of fuel oil affecting manufacturing and fuel for transport, impacting shipping, aviation and road travel. Oil price increases also effect the commodity cost of stable food stuffs such as wheat and rice – the fuel for vehicles used in harvesting and transporting them doubling in price in the past year.   When a commodity price changes it effects the price of all the things that depend on that commodity.  Truly insightful stuff.  At least the author was right about something."

The problem with Fukushima btw. was that it was built with a maximum strength earthquake in mind—based on historic data—which was then comfortably exceeded by reality. And that will always happen. Estimates are that a full 10% of existing nuclear reactors are at similar risk.  Look, I myself think that nuclear is a good option.

Solar PV - 10GW * 0.2 * 8760 = 17.52TWh (only during daylight)  Nuclear - 3.2GW * 0.7 * 8760 = 19.62TWh (25.23TWh @90%cf) (24/7)  This is ignoring that PV can only power at peak (10GW) at 12 noon in the middle of summer on a cloudless day. Whereas Nuclear can provide peak 24/7 for 90-70% of the year. Also there is the thing about rotational inertia and maintaining a proper frequency with the rise and decline of PV over a day.

Basically, if someone wants to build a wind farm the government comes in and says it will provide a large tax write off if they complete it in x amount of time. It has no bearing on the profitability of the turbines after they are built and they receive no further subsidies after that. Some of the larger renewable providers are actually lobbying to have the PTC's revoked because it will hurt their smaller competition and they don't need it. This bases profitability entirely on how much the wind blows/sun shines and the reliability of the machines, which gets better every year. I've personally seen an 8 year old wind farm net $1,000,000 a day in power directly sold to the utilities with a small fraction of that going towards operations and maintenance. That's literally out of thin air with no impact to the environment. You might want to research into the subsidies provided to ALL forms of power generation before pointing your finger at renewables."

That's what we call nameplate capacity,  aka how much power it can provide at max specs under ideal conditions.     If your solar panel is working at that capacity you'll get 100 kwh of energy every hour.   Sadly,  that's not how solar panels work,  they don't run at nameplate the best majority of the time and for half the day the sun isn't even out.   Capacity factor is what percent of nameplate the panel actually produces on average over a long period of time,  such as a year.   Most solar panels have around a 15% capacity factor in new England (and that's generous).  This means that your 100 kw set up gives you on average 14kwh per hour.   If you compared this to fossil fuel or nuclear or hydro,  that 100kw set up is the super rough equivalent of a 15-20kw generator,  difference being you can control when those produce whereas with solar it's out of your hands.   That's why you have to look at energy generated by solar not just installed capacity (which is good to know for growth and to estimate the costs and size of the market)."
energy,3cb2z2,Fremen13,3,Tue Jul 7 12:59:35 2015 UTC,"So when graphs show ""capacity"" installed, that's NOT the same as capacity factor x max output installed? It's just the nameplate capacity? That's kind of confusing, since the term capacity shows up in both.  So when, say, a Gigawatt coal plant is built, is that talking about max output or average? Because I know thermal plants don't run at maximum all the time either."

To get a better idea of how much energy a plant actually makes, you usually want to look at it's total year output (or average of a number of years).  If that's not available, you need to know the capacity factor (CF).  Generally each new source's CF will be somewhere close to the average of its type:   Nuclear ~90% Coal ~60% Hydro ~50% Gas ~50% Wind ~30% Solar ~20%"

If you add to this the fact that hydrogen is industrially important anyway, that you're offsetting natural gas consumption this way, and that solar in particular is especially suited for this purpose because of its low-voltage DC nature (a properly designed solar facility with electrolysis option could avoid lots of expensive power conversion equipment), it becomes clear that the growing electrolysis market and growing PV penetration could reap some mutual benefits even if you avoid eventually using the hydrogen for power generation purposes (and instead use some of the offset natural gas that you've saved).  (Interestingly, though, a combined-cycle gas plant is not vastly less efficient than a fuel cell these days, and it scales much more cheaply that fuel cells, so that particular point seems a bit moot.)"

But oversizing the capacity (with respect to annual generation levels that would be required under the assumption of available zero-cost, infinite-capacity storage) helps provide a less intermittent power source (which, I believe, was the primary issue here) with the side benefit of offsetting your extra costs (for extra panels and supports) by selling a commercially desired and highly valued product."

The prediction still is that the capital and operating costs for the necessary equipment, as well as the energy losses of the process, will continue to fall.

One issue is that between last November and April, china was purchasing enormous amounts of crude oil at the cheap prices in order to fill their Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  But when the price got above $60 and when their stock markets and overall economy began to crash, they may well have stopped buying. Another issue is that the European economy is suffering greatly and the situation in Greece is not helping at all. Still another issue is that the US EIA is reporting that US oil production is still hitting all-time highs although traders had expected that number to start dropping in May or June due to the reduced rig count.  One very good thing about this (depending, of course, on your personal situation) is that cheap oil puts a serious crimp in any efforts to increase solar power generation -- because despite what their propagandists keep trumpeting from the rooftops, solar just costs too much, even with huge government subsidies.  Another big thing this does is to weaken US oil exploration and investment.  It COSTS US jobs, although the BLS is apparently trying very hard to hide that information.  Energy development has been the one industry in the US which had been bucking the trend (of disintegration and demoliton and replacement with foreign imports).

Let's start out with the discussion of wholesale prices. Every source of generation has a fixed cost and a variable cost. The fixed cost is largely based on the cost of construction, but also includes the operating staff, maintenance based on a certain time schedule and property taxes etc. The variable cost is based on how much energy is produced and is largely based on the fuel costs, but also includes maintenance based on hours operated and certain environmental taxes (like say purchasing emissions allowances). The wholesale price is a MARKET price and isn't what the end user pays. The wholesale price is based on the most expensive VARIABLE cost of any unit operating at any given time. The reason that it only includes variable costs is because the fixed costs are already ""sunk"". Once the plant is built the bonds that paid for it's construction have to be paid back whether it operates or not. Different sources of generation have different fixed costs and variable costs. A simple cycle gas turbine is almost entirely variable costs while a wind turbine or hydro plant is almost all fixed costs. Coal is about evenly split between variable and fixed costs whereas nuclear is 90% fixed costs. The point is that in order to make money a generating plant has to pay off BOTH it's fixed and variable costs. However, looking at the wholesale rates and the dispatch order doesn't really tell you much about the total cost of generation. Let's take wind for example. Wind has virtually no variable costs. Wind will almost always be first in the dispatch order as a result, but that does NOT mean wind is free (or even close). The fixed costs are still there and still need to be paid for. Let's say the fixed costs are $60/MWH. If demand is really low and the wind is going gangbusters then this article rightly points out that the wholesale rates might drop down to virtually nothing. Let's say $10/MWH for this example. That might seem like a great thing for the wind producers, but it's actually terrible for them. If they need to average $60/MWH to pay off their debt and they end up making $10/MWH a lot of the time then they are bleeding money (and of course if it's your utility doing so it will be you as the consumer paying the difference). Of course, that's just the bad side. If demand is high and wholesale prices skyrocket to $200/MWH and the wind is still blowing then of course wind is making a killing. However, what people need to keep in mind here is that a few days of $10/MWH prices might be a good thing, but if it's happening too much it means the market is oversupplied and everyone is losing money (money which you as the consumer will ultimately be stuck for unless the generators are privately owned). The fact that a coal plant isn't running shouldn't be a reason for anyone to brag because even if it's not running you're still paying for it AND the wind turbines! Wind turbines are actually notoriously bad at proverbially ""shooting themselves in the foot"" because they invariably drive DOWN the wholesale prices while they are producing the most and drive UP the wholesale prices while they aren't producing. This is the fundamental problem with sources of generation which are not dispatchable. The value of the energy they produce is much less per unit than the value of a dispatchable resource like a natural gas plant. If that difference can't be captured through demand charges then the market invariably gets skewed."
energy,3c762n,cracked_mud,3,Sun Jul 5 23:17:15 2015 UTC,"I am glad we're finally on the same page! Now you can put yourself in the feet of people commissioning power plants.  As you say, additional wind farms and other renewable energy sources bid really low (or even at $0) in the dispatch market, since their marginal cost of power is almost zero. And yes, this can be a hindrance to other generators and their own industry. Especially if over the course of the year they dispatched all their energy at a cost that was lower than their LCOE (LCOE encompasses all the costs of the generator). But this is how energy markets work. And it's been great for consumers (as explained here).  The same dynamic also affects coal and conventional generators, or even potential alternative generators (like nuclear). This is why it is so important for the LCOE of plants to remain low (so that they can, on average, beat the market every year). Nuclear is currently being dispatched at at least 11c/kwh in most markets. And you can bet that a new plant in Australia will be even more expensive, considering that we don't have the appropriate industry or expertise.   This is why Nuclear is currently shunned by investors. It has less to do with the risk of accidents and waste spillages, than with economics. And remember, solar is threatening to reach an LCOE of just 2c/kWh in the next decade (less time than it will take to set up a nuclear power plant). At which point adding batteries would likley be a better solution to improve dispatch-ability than commissioning nuclear (which has too many political and technical obstacles to overcome)."

I'm still not used to these deregulated markets as I'm used to a regulated market. It seems crazy to me that some places pay EVERYONE the top rate. They definitely don't do that around here. But of course in regulated markets they pay to keep peaking plants on ""retainer"" so they are basically paying them even when they aren't producing just in case they need them later.  However, I've seen the example in the video happen in real life (electricity prices increase 10 fold over the course of a few hours), but the fact that can happen with electricity is an example of a completely messed up market. Namely the fact that end users don't see any price signals as they usually pay a flat rate. They ended that around here about a decade ago and if prices start to skyrocket like that the utility has agreements with customers to just shut them down to keep prices reasonable. Also, in the US it's virtually impossible for prices to rise that high anymore since natural gas is dirt fucking cheap and that's what's used for peaking power anyways."

And his counter arguments are also paltry. Ted says he doesn't belive the average household system could be 2kW. Well put your money where your mouth is Ted! Look it up! It's right there in the Clean Energy Regulators Postcode data.  So far 4,244,222 kW worth of small systems have been installed across 2,341,475 systems. Thus, average system size is 1.8 kW (and it continues to grow here is the source). So 2kW it actually in line with expectations.  Ted's critique seems like he's clutching at straws to find gaps and he makes his own assumptions. It's far more likely that McGill et al. considered many of the issues he's raised but cannot submit a whole book to one of the journals (like Ted asking for the EROI calculations to be part of the work... what the hell? Leave that to another study).  Ian McGhill is a respected engineer and has worked with AEMO and done extensive work including consulting advice to model the NEM. I would trust his work over Ted's in a heartbeat.  edit:  Also, you say:   For example Geothermal and CST in Australia are nowhere near commercial development because the combo of wind and gas has kept wholesale prices down, and the market is oversupplied. Most recent CST project (50MW + storage) has a NPV of -$297million and a CAPEX of $550million.   And I agree it still has ways to go. But GemaSolar in Spain have shown that you can build CST projects with 16 hours of storage. And at least the CSIRO have 2 pilot CST plants that they are thinking to take to the commercial stage. There is an industry goal (in the US) that CST plants will achieve around 6c/kWh LCOE in the next 5 years or so (from the learnings of Ivanpah and others.).  Nuclear is great, but it will take way longer to develop and there is no reliable evidence or pathway for them to have a competitive LCOE."

AEMO did a 100% renewable study and it wasn't as easy as these authors are stating.  I take their study over this. Especially considering that in the 100% Renewable for South Australia document was a commission for the main Environmental lobby group in South Australia who have a 100% renewable policy.

The study Ian did was not for South Australia only, and it was not comissioned by a mandate, but more so by the University to study what renewables could do to help the (at the time) government's goal:  The Australian Government has a policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80% below year 2000 levels by 2050.  I think the ancillary benefits from renewable energy are substantial. But this has largely become irrelevant. Under current industry roadmaps they are already some of the most economical solutions and will become even stronger in this criteria in the future."

Either that or start burning trees and pretend it doesn't release CO2 and carcinogens.   . Last year 33 per cent of its annual electricity consumption was generated by the wind and 6 per cent from rooftop solar.   Can you guess how much for coal?   Coal power will soon disappear from SA and eventually from the whole country. Because wind has no fuel cost, it can bid the lowest price into the electricity market and so is ranked higher in operating order than coal. The result: coal is displaced from operating as base-load (24/7) power, coal's economics become worse and incidentally the wholesale price of electricity decreases.   How is it going to disappear if wind is dependent on it for backup?  You can shut down some stations if you have excess capacity, but for every watt of wind power, you need a watt of coal/hydro/trees/dispatchable source.

If the Tesla Powerpak can really deliver an LCOE of about 15 cents/KwH or lower, then it would be cheaper for KIUC to generate power from solar and store it rather than burn high end oil.  A system with 200 MW of solar, 175 MwH of batteries, and a 25 MW backup generator would take care of things nicely.

If you overbuild solar, you are going to be paying for curtailment or wasting the energy if you generate more than load.  But, any watts above peak demand don't need a watt of backup.  Backup can come from batteries that were filled by intermittent power sources.  However, you can't run a power system solely on batteries and solar/wind because of other technical problems.

If the Tesla Powerpak can really deliver an LCOE of about 15 cents/KwH or lower,   Aren't you forgetting that you have to add the price paid for solar to the storage costs?   No, I did not forget that. Solar on Kauai costs around 10 cents per KwH. Burning oil costs around 30 cents per KwH.

I can't find detailed specs on the Tesla powerpack, but competing products all can deliver instantaneous power in a range of 15%-25% of the total storage capacity.

energy,3c6ujs,caracter_2,6,Sun Jul 5 19:00:52 2015 UTC,"But there are simple reasons which you and I can both understand why the Weißbach study is flawed...  The EROEI calculations from Weißbach used 1000 PSH as the average incident energy per square metre per year. This was based on assuming South of Germany as the installation location. The author of OP's article is foolishly using the study in relation to Australia, but most of Australia receives nearly twice as much solar irradiance. This alone nearly doubles the EROI of solar. There are also several other outdated figures I've previously pointed out in the Weißbach report. Here is a summary:   The study assumes 1000 PSH per year. This is only true for places with a low solar resource. Good places (like most of Australia) have twice that. It assumes the efficiency for a solar panel (not the efficiency of the cells itself) is 13.2% This is unrealistic, as even cheap panels from china already have module efficiencies of 16.3% (source: Suntech Panels). And panels using HIT technology or SunPowers' back contact (still expensive but continually coming down in price) have module efficiencies of 19% (source: HIT cell panels) or even 21.5% (source: Sunpower Panels) So just by that we know that the EROI in that paper is off on the module components by at least 23%. It assumes inverter and dust losses are equal to 25%. This again is an exagerated amount with most conservative estimates of dust, inverter, line lossess, manufacturers tollerance and temperature losses combined equating to 20% (Source:Solarquotes.com.au). So combined it's likley the average panel that is 16.3% efficient and with combined losses has an actual efficiency of 13% (not the 9.9% claimed in page 13 of that report). The embodied energy figure in the study does not take into consideration the massive reduction in energy now required to produce polysilicon due to the use of fluidised bed reactors which can entail a reduction in the most energy-intensive step by 90%. Read more about that here.   Combined, issues one through 3 underestimate the EROI by nearly 3-fold (I calculated this in a previous post). With the addition of the fluidised bed reactor error, it's possible the unbuffered EROI of solar PV could be far greater than 10, and the buffered EROI, somewhere around 6."

energy,3c6ujs,technologyisnatural,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:49:56 2015 UTC,"Hanwha Q Cells. That sounds good.   We can use this value to try to calculate the embodied emissions and compare it to Weißbach's numbers.  Using the  carbon intensity of the German grid of 0.47 kg CO2e per kWh (this is scope 2 only, sourced from DEFRA's factors), and assuming all the embodied emissions can be equated to energy consumption as electricity in Germany (which is unlikely, so my calculations will be worst case), then this means it took 851 kWh of energy to produce each peak kW of panels. This is equal to 3,064 MJ. There are many Q Cells panels, but I believe, in general, their standard (not flagship) product has an efficiency of 16% (got it from this data sheet)  So for each peak watt they will require an area given by:  1,000 W/m2 ÷ (0.16 X 1kWp) =6.25 m2  So now we can calculate the embodied energy from the panels per m2.   Embodied energy per peak kW = 3,064 MJ  Area per peak kW = 6.25 m2  Embodied energy per m2 = 490.24 MJ/m2  This compares to the figure in Weißbach et al. (page 14) of 1,772 MJ for the production component of a module per m2. So the report is off potentially by 3.6 times.  However, I'm concerned, because I cannot find a copy of the LCA for these Q Cells, so I'm not sure of the boundaries of it and whether the figure of 400 kg CO2e per peak watt encompasses the entire panel production (not just the cell), and whether it includes all scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions.  Even so, if we take the energy from just the cell production from Weißbach et al, we get 1,292 MJ. Which still means that Q Cells have an energy footprint that is 2.6 times lower than what Weißbach et al. calculated."

Shiny new efficiency figures degrade significantly throughout the system lifetime, lowering the average.  The Weißbach assumptions are just fine for 1-3.  Fluidized bed reactors are a genuine breakthrough, but even they don't come for free.  They produce relatively low impurity silicon, limiting you to relatively low efficiency solar cells.  Still, it's a significant improvement, so Weißbach needs updating there."
energy,3c6ujs,Topgun2013,3,Mon Jul 6 06:53:06 2015 UTC,"You're exaggerating the losses from temperature. Take the white paper for the module I linked (These Suntech Panels).  Even if the panels where at 45 degrees C for their entire operational life (which is a woeful and unrealistic example), the panel would only experience an 11% drop in power (as per their power coefficients). Here's the maths:  45ºC- 20ºC (standard testing conditions) = 25ºC Multiply that by the coefficient in the panels white paper (-0.42% per ºC) is 11%.  Additionally, this is already accounted for in our overall losses of (see my previous comment where I work this out. But say I take your point, perhaps overall the panels are de-rated by about an extra 5% from temperature drops and thus his assumption of 25% is fine (instead of the 20% which I think is more realistic). He's still off the mark significantly.  Also efficiency degradation is minimal for PV panels. That's why panel manufacturers are comfortable having a warranty of 80% of nominal power after 20 years. In the white paper for the Suntech panels you can see that they're offering this warranty at linear degradation for 25 years. Not too shabby. So for Weißbach's example you could de-rate the panels a bit to account for degradation (10% average over a 25 year lifespan). We can take that and throw point 3 away from my previous post and he's still of the mark by at least twofold. And that's without taking the fludised bed reactor into account. Or the fact the he may have used an even more efficient panel. I chose one of the cheapest Chinese ones with low efficiency!  Edit: I actually calculated the temperature of the cells wrong, but you can use the formula in this page and calculate the losses based on the ambient air temperature and the NOCT temperature of the cell (which is given in the white paper for the modules as 45ºC). If I assume the ambient air temperature is going to be 40ºC all the time and there is always maximum insolation on the cells (100mW per cm2) then the temperature  of the cell would be 71ºC. You calculate the power loss based on this temperature and its deviation from the cells' NOCT (45ºC). Which also comes to about 11%. But the air only gets that hot on a few hours for a few days of the year! So in fact the de-rating from temperature overall should be much much lower."

If a device draws 400mA of current, the drop across this internal resistance is around 0.2v. This means that the device would see only 1.1V at the terminal of the battery. The third aspect of the question is that when Batteroo’s CEO talks about batteries stop functioning at 1.3V, if you place that battery in a device described above, under load, the terminals of the battery would provide only 1.1V to the device and that is where the questioner agrees the device stops functioning. This is most likely the source of the discrepancy between what you stated as the low range of operation of devices vs. what is quoted as the open voltage of the batteries by the company.   Okay, but Duracell's datasheet shows that at 1.1V closed circuit voltage the battery is 90%-100% empty, so the device stops working when it should, and there's no 800% more energy left to extract.

Plus, as Dave points out, a gadget that cuts out at the Batteriser team's claimed 1.3V wouldn't work with rechargeable cells.  Is anything designed that poorly these days?  A boost circuit belongs in the thing you're powering, not in the battery/cell.   The Batteriser inventors hold several PhDs, while Dave Jones graduated from Dramatic Arts School.

With Batterwoo's own guys admitting ""Batteriser uses a boost circuitry that can work down to 0.5v."", yet this study admits:   Almost discharged batteries (Vi < 1.0V) show a rapid declining voltage, measurement is not significant, their remaining capacity is very low. Thus, all batteries with an initial voltage of less than 1.0V are registered as 0V and assumed fully discharged.    So you're not getting anywhere near 800% battery life.  Then there's the testing:    All batteries are discharged with a constant current load of 120mA down to 0.9V.    That's nowhere near what many products need from batteries, that's practically testing it on the lowest power-hungy products possible. We already have low-internal-resistance batteries like Sanyo's Enerloops for these products. They give great battery life with very low (for the chemistry) internal resistance.  you're not powering cameras (which the test discovers uses 690ma per shot) and toys, etc with just 120ma.  Fig 9 shows the camera test, where the Lithium AA's had the best power, outperforming the cheaper AA's, giving more photos. Problem with Batterwoo is, if the boost circuit is upping the voltage by decreasing the amperage, then where are you getting the extra batterylife from? you just killed the amperage you need to power the camera !  Then there's the safety element.  You can't force the battery to deliver the amperage as if it was full, when it's nearly empty, that is simply unsafe and foolish practise. There's a reason you can only discharge batteries at their ""C rating"" (maximum discharge current in multiples of nominal capacity).  The whole ""test"" is flawed and in no way supports Batterywoo's claims of anywhere near 800% battery life."

The batteriser has another disadvantage, which is that for a battery at less than 1.5V it must draw higher current from the battery than it puts out to the load (just from conservation of energy, plus some inefficiency in the device). This means that for a device that would have continued working down to 1V or whatever, it will actually drain the battery faster and get less usable capacity in that voltage range. So for some devices, the batteriser might actually reduce the  number of service hours you get out.    And I'm certainly not mad at this thing - it's pretty cool that they've managed to fit the thing in such small form factor, and I'll probably buy one to play with. But they've definitely overhyped the product and done their best to make it at least sound like a scam by claiming an 800% increase.

In there you see the ""safety"" bullet point... passive safety.  I think that's doing exactly what Llewellyn argues against... ""hey we're safe"".  Thorium and MSR advocates see a lot of success communicating the drain-tank (or ""dump-tank"") because it is clear how it works. Everyone understands a bloody drain tank.  In the same way, everyone can understand a bloody emergency water tank. I don't even think it needs to be said in words, just show that there's a tank of water sitting right on top of the reactor.  That's the same as showing a child clicking a seatbelt. No need to proclaim safety. No need to show a car hitting a post and the kid being restrained by the belt. Just show a mechanism that the public can intuitively get, that such a thing even exists.  I'm not claiming to be an expert on this. Maybe my idea is wrong.  But I'm pretty sure what Westinghouse is doing... their commercial and also this bizarre video...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghy9aba3kHU  ...(from which they removed the voice of Mother explaining the Nostromo is about to self-destruct) can't possibly be a piece of communication useful to the general public.

Got to speak to a Westinghouse fellow at a small reactor summit. He was not at all satisfied with their communications.

We have a largish hydrogen tankage compound that I can see from my desk window.  Round the corner is a working hydrogen filling station.  I've even seen some demo/test hydrogen fuel cell vehicles on occasion, including IE's black London cab.  Lots of R&D going on.  We also have EV charging infrastructure on the campus.  This isn't so much R&D: its commercial, use-it-right-now tech. People I share the office with (including one of my bosses) have Li-Ion battery EVs that they charge at this infrastructure. EV charging infrastructure doesn't just exist on our campus and in a few select locations - its all over the place and growing rapidly. Plug in Hybrids (PHEVs) can also make use of this infrastructure and thus the user base is pretty wide. Only this morning I read that over 40K Outlander PHEVs have been sold in Europe - 10K in the UK alone.  I think we've already seen much of this VHS vs Betamax war.  The fuel cell folk may have missed the marketing boat. Their tech might end up being better but by the time they're ready to do start a full, commercial scale roll out there'll already be hundreds of thousands of BEV/PHEVs, charging points and related infrastructure out there to compete against. That's going to be a very tough market to go up against and crack."

More spending money for the lower and middle classes means more disposable income to throw into their 401Ks (which then get invested, in part, into energy start-ups which are mainly renewables and emerging markets which love solar). It also means they can buy that new more fuel efficient car they have been putting off or investing in rooftop solar because they're saving an extra $100-200 per month which can go toward something that can make a return on investment instead of just being burned from their fuel tank."

Secondly, OPEC is keeping oil production high because of the US oil and gas glut. If they don't keep output high global oil prices go up and make fracking in the US viable again. Reduced energy costs boost the global economy and make US domestic industries like manufacturing more profitable.  What we will see in the next 10-15 years is an oil deathspiral as more fuel efficient and electric cars hit the road.  Subsidies insentivise markets. The oil and gas industry gets lots of subsidies. So do new home owners. So do banks and small businesses. Explain why you think subsidizing solar is bad when we subsidize oil, gas, and nuclear?

State owned enterprises in soviet Russia and more recently the Italian FIAT, or the monstrously big bureaucratic apparatuses  of Greece seem to me like unproductive money black holes.

energy,3c190n,RiverWithoutShore,3,Fri Jul 3 21:37:51 2015 UTC,"Sustainability is the problem there...   You can't look at it over a very short time frame or it doesn't make sense. To you, you have carbon locked up in a lump of wood and a lump of coal, you burn them both, and now you have no lump of coal or wood, and you have CO2 in the air. Think bigger.   In reality, there is a certain amount of carbon on earth, and it is distributed into different places. Carbon in life is constantly cycled between being trapped in the biosphere and in the atmosphere. A plant grows, sequesters carbon, dies (or is eaten), is broken down by organisms, the energy in the plant used, and the carbon released back to the atmosphere. The CO2 you are breathing out right now was sequestered by a plant.  In rare conditions, carbon is trapped in the ground, sometimes in the form of useable fossil fuels. Most of our coal was formed in the carboniferous period >300mya (guess why it was called that). This takes a long time - millions of years, and usually only very slowly - you need worldwide rare conditions - swamp like (think Dagobagh) for real fossil fuel  formation.   What matters to humans is this balance between carbon in the atmosphere and in life - in the biosphere. If you burn your lump of wood - co2 goes from the biosphere to the atmosphere. If you didn't burn the wood... It would rot, organisms, likely fungi would break it down and over a number of years all of that carbon would return to the atmosphere. This is the crux of the situation. Carbon goes to the atmosphere no matter what from the wood, the question is whether humans use the energy or bacteria and fungi do.  You don't disrupt the cycle, there is no net increase in carbon.   On the other hand, if you burn the fossil fuels, you add carbon to the system, there is a net increase in CO2. Because CO2 is not limiting to growth in most places in the world, the balance cannot be restored over the time period relevant to humans, there is more CO2 in the atmosphere, and this has consequences.   Of course you must do this sustainably - you can't just bulldoze a rainforest and burn it all, that would be ecologically devastating, and the ultimate aim here is to preserve life, so that is pointless.   Another point is that you are taking energy that is destined for other organisms, and directly converting it to heat. If these are bacteria and fungi... Nobody gives a shit. If these organisms happen to be humans because you are using food, then you reduce food supply, increase prices, and hence people have less money to spend on other things, or can't afford food at all.   In this way, growing corn or sugarcane for biomass competes with food. However, if you use waste products - sewage, food waste, straw etc, you aren't competing with food and humans, you're competing with bacteria again.   So biomass makes sense, but it's only really sensible when it uses waste, and is harder to justify beyond that - so it makes lots of sense in a lot of places, but it's never going to supply anywhere near all of our energy needs."

Variance in sources as well as enough transmission to power a nonwindy region off a windy region can get you a higher percentage of renewable generation.   I agree an approach from both sides - hydro/nuclear baseload and wind-coal load follow would lower the emissions faster. But they are trying to get wind-coal-big transmission to replace baseload.

The politician has to approach with a solution he/she can get people to agree on. In Germany, this means no nuclear. However, a politician also relies on/utilizes innovation and technological advancement.   Basically, there is a political advantage to force a tight spot to encourage innovation and technological advancement. Its polar opposite to an engineering approach, but these kinds of things do lead to new solutions. As a citizen, I wouldn't want to be a German subjected to the experiment.

Most people, renewable advocates and utility execs alike, simply don't understand exponential growth. The amount of solar and wind in Germany right now is well beyond what anyone thought there would be a decade ago.   They put themselves in a tight spot while telling the world it would not lead to this.   The utilities did not plan for high renewable penetration because they believed it would never happen. Now that it has happened, the complete lack of planning for it shows.  That story repeats itself pretty much everywhere.  1) People start adopting renewables.  2) Utilities don't think it will ever amount to anything and pretty much just ignore them.  3) Renewables grow to the point that it starts causing problems on the grid.  4) The utilities say ""Wow, who could have possibility seen that coming?"" The utilities then scramble to react.  Two examples of extreme lack of foresight on both sides:  1) Utility lack of foresight: Regulations for PV inverters in the USA say if the voltage on the grid goes out of specification, the inverter is supposed to disconnect. This is foolish. An inverter can trivially be programmed to do almost anything. An immediate disconnect is never the right thing to do in an undervoltage situation. That makes the problem worse, but that is still what most US utilities require. Hawaii, with more PV than anyone else in the states just changed their rules to allow sane behavior of the inverters.  2) Renewable advocate lack of foresight: Anyone pushing for net metering (I am looking at you SEIA). Net metering pays too little when there is very little solar, pays the right amount when there is about 1-2% solar on the grid, and then overpays when there is more than 2% solar on the grid. One could make an argument that underpaying solar owners is OK because of a simpler structure. But there is no defensible argument to overpay solar owners in high penetration areas (e.g. California). An example of a state that recently changed this to a great way is Minnesota that uses what they call the ""value of solar"". This is calculated every year. As more solar is added to the system, the value goes down and what is paid reflects this.  Both examples 1 and 2 could and should have been adopted decades ago. That they are just starting to be adopted now shows how the entire system is not very good at anticipating problems."

It's a bit like zero-energy homes... If you do the math, spending a lot more to make a home that is passive only makes economic sense if energy costs were much higher than they actually are. Amortization over 100 years is damn risky."
energy,3bs8xh,IkeLives,2,Thu Jul 2 01:17:23 2015 UTC,"The reactor designers know this issue and are attempting to design around it.  A big reason for the long payoff terms is because so much of the plant is for backup systems that don't produce anything in normal operation. New designs compromise fuel economy to make the safety more passive which reduces the backup systems and the personal to maintain them. Since nuclear fuel is cheap (on a mmbtu basis), this should lead to lower costs. And since fuel is a variable cost, not upfront cost, this should also go a long ways to making the economics of the plant closer to the economics of other plants.   Passive designs are also safer as they tend to have fewer covariances. The fewer covariances, the less likely something goes unanalyzed.  The biggest challenge is the NRC. Regulators have to ensure the design with less backup systems is as safe as Gen III designs. Many in the NRC have the 'backup systems and backup systems for backup systems' mentality and moving the thought process without compromising regulator independence will be a challenge.  If it gets through that process as designed with an NRC stamp, the upfront cost of SMR's and Gen III+ designs should be far lower.  If the NRC finds issues and requires additional backup systems to ensure safety, it will circle back to the same problems as previous designs."

The result of that being if the price of gas is low, you build gas fired turbines and if the price of gas is high then you build nuclear as the fuel costs next to nothing.  It also depends how your counties energy market is set up.

energy,3bs8xh,knowyourbrain,2,Thu Jul 2 12:03:43 2015 UTC,No such reactor exists. Why would a country seeking a nuclear bomb spend tens if billions developing this technology when they could spend 500 million for a centerfuge plant?

Edit: I'm still not sure it's germane to the part of the article I was discussing, but one reason you might want to build a thorium reactor instead of depending on a supply of uranium is because it is much more widely available. You can dig up thorium in many or most countries whereas uranium is much more concentrated in certain places. Controlling the trade in thorium will be much more difficult than what is now done for uranium. Again, rolling out a next generation of thorium reactors is not without nuclear proliferation risks."
energy,3bs8xh,spice_up_your_life,3,Thu Jul 2 13:54:51 2015 UTC,"It isn't ""much"" more widely available, it's about 3x as widely available which isn't a game changer. Uranium can literally be extracted from sea water."
energy,3bs8xh,10ebbor10,2,Thu Jul 2 15:08:14 2015 UTC,"Interesting article.  I feel it makes the beginning of a case, but doesn't quite complete it:   The world has but one experience of using U-233 in nuclear bombs. In 1955, the United States detonated a composite U-233/plutonium bomb in the Nevada desert as part of the Operation TEAPOT nuclear test series. The device detonated successfully, albeit with a lower than anticipated yield. With over half a century of nuclear weapons technology advances since then, there's little doubt that U-233 bombs could be made highly viable, especially given the very high purities achievable, at least in principle, using LFTR technology with protactinium removal.   With a lower-than-expected yield (an no further studies into the subject) how important was U-233 in making the bomb?  What kind of plutonium is necessary, how easy is it to procure that, and how much do you need relative to other bomb morphologies?    How does the loss of U-233 affect the neutron availability of the reactor core (and, ultimately, its power output - something that can be easily monitored).  How low is its U-232 concentration; does it need to be centrifuged out, does it require special equipment to work with, or can its low (but still present) gamma emissions be easily detected?    I don't mean to say the article is invalid.  It brings up important points, and does so in a level and fair voice.  I just feel a bit more is needed before damning the anti-proliferation measures of liquid fuel reactors."
energy,3bs8xh,WiseChoices,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:08:40 2015 UTC,"All good questions. Many were discussed in the comments after that article. The commenters argue that the U233 did not contribute to the TEAPOT explosion. I have heard that the easy detection of U232 could help in the monitoring/inspections, and that most of the U233 has to go back into the reactor to keep it at criticality. However, just that there needs to be inspections and monitoring suggests a non-zero proliferation risk. I'm not sure how the reprocessing is done; I suppose it's centrifuged. It has to be done remotely because the U232 is so dangerous."
energy,3bs8xh,mirh,2,Thu Jul 2 18:12:46 2015 UTC,"However, just that there needs to be inspections and monitoring suggests a non-zero proliferation risk.    I make no claims there's no proliferation risk - at any nuclear plant, refinery, mine, or storage site, really.  I feel the best course of action is to minimize proliferation risks, but then monitor anyway.  If we can get physics to do the heavy lifting - such as by creating a tight neutron economy, or gamma poisons, or whatever - we can do robust, effective monitoring, too."
energy,3bs8xh,WiseChoices,0,Thu Jul 2 18:23:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly how much thorium reactors reduce the threat of proliferation depends on the details of their design, but it's not down to zero.   People fail to consider that using the Thorium fuel cycle produces a pure (or mostly pure) stream of U-233. This is far from proliferation resistant. If I decide I want to make a bomb using one of these reactors, all I have to do is separate off the U-233 and start rolling out the nukes. Thorium is not the be all and end all people claim it to be."
energy,3bs8xh,mirh,2,Thu Jul 2 05:14:27 2015 UTC,"Actually the thorium cycle doesn't produce pure U-233. It's contaminated with U-232, which has highly radioactive decay products and would likely cause any weapon to spontanously detonate. U-232 is impossible to chemically seperate from U-233, so...  Similar reason why you can't use Plutonium from a power reactor."
energy,3bswg9,Splenda,2,Wed Jul 1 21:47:44 2015 UTC,"This is cool  SCE is using ""hosting capacity"" in their model.  Hosting capacity is a set of metrics used to qualify how distributed generation affects the bulk power system.  Engineering issues like overcurrent conditions, impact on power quality, etc are quantified by hosting capacity.  You can then use hosting capacity to solve the optimization problem of how much generation can you add at the distribution end of the grid without upsetting it.  They're also modeling most of their feeders (circuits that feed customers) by using approximations based on 30 existing SCE feeders.  My gut says they need to use actuals but if their approximations work, other utilities will follow.  Most utilities right now have no computer model of their distribution system.  So if a whole neighborhood of houses wants to stick 4KW solar on their roof, there's no simulation available to solve the powerflow equation or determine the impact of that distributed generation on the grid.  If you want to model 50 feeders with actuals, that's something like 2-3 million dollars worth of work.  If you can use approximations, utilities will end up saving a shit ton of $$$."
