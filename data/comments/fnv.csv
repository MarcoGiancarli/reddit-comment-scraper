fnv,3e2x85,Awesometron99,10,Tue Jul 21 16:15:45 2015 UTC,"Just get all the snowglobes in the game. That's about 22K free caps just for getting some Misc. items in easy to reach places.  Also if you're vilified by the Legion or NCR, later in the game the assassins they sent to kill you drop some very valuable weapons, such as 12.7mm Pistols, Ranger Sequoia's, 10mm pistols, Sawed-off Shotguns, and Sniper Rifles. That stuff can all be sold for atleast 900 caps, so it's a good source of money once the hit squads start becoming more of an annoyance than a threat."

You can pull between 9 to 15 thousand caps from each of the casinos on the Strip, which is easily manageable if you know vaguely how Blackjack works and have a luck stat that isn't total garbage.  Couple that with a mod that allows the total amount earned at a casino to refresh over time, and you can make a pretty penny whenever you need it.  Also, you get to play Blackjack, which I feel is a reward unto itself."

Also if you want money, at the end of Dead Money you can get a few (or 37 if you feel like getting stupidly rich) gold bars. Each one is worth around 10.7K caps, so you'll be good in money for the rest of forever.  However, Dead Money is one of the more annoying DLC to play, but the end rewards are great. You can get hundreds of stimpacks, repair kits, chems, food, or anything else you want from the Vending Machines once it's over."

I understand i could trade a gun for a gold bar and maybe some other items but i've read about vendors with that many caps but everytime i check on these vendors they have like 900 max. Specifically i have checked on the old woman north of good springs and the guns runner? under the bridge with the pencil stache. Both only have around 900 caps everytime i check but maybe i'm not letting them replinish their stock?

Even plates and tin cans, literally anything it would let me sell. It was really irritating at first cause I'd get overencumbered and have to make two or three trips to shops but it definetely helps. When I had enough caps I bought two decent guns (one for Boone and one for myself) and then everytime I passed a store I would buy all the ammo and stimpacks I could afford. Now I have 4 really amazing guns, 2 heavy amour, 150 stimpacks, 30 super stimpacks, almost unlimited amo and 24000 caps. Its boring and irritating at first but it pays off in the end! Hope that helps :)"
fnv,3e2x85,Rosario_Di_Spada,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:34 2015 UTC,"Blackjack is your friend. Specifically, basic blackjack strategy. It can be a money making machine for you. I usually keep my betting at around 5% of my chip total; if I'm starting with 1000 chips, I bet 50 a hand til I get to 2000, then go up to 100, then 150 at 3000, etc. If I lose enough in a row to drop down to the next lower level, I decrease my bet. Same holds true even if you don't have 1000 to start gambling with.  I can usually do a speed run to Vegas and use what I've got on me to max out at the Atomic Wrangler. That gives me more than enough seed money to get onto the Strip and work my way through Gamorrah, the Tops, and the Ultra-Luxe. If I'm really hard up I'll go back to Primm to gamble but now that I've got the achievement to get banned from all the casinos it's rarely worth the trouble. With just the Wrangler and the three Strip casinos, that's nearly 40,000 caps. Plus some booze, some chems, a nice steak, fancy clothes, a suit of reinforced combat armor, and two comped rooms, and you don't even have to break a sweat.   But like the other folks said, after a while you will be bringing in high price gear faster than you can sell it, and money will stop being a concern altogether. If you're needing caps early on and you're already on the Strip, though, blackjack will do it. If you've got a high luck it just rolls in even faster."

And, there seems to be a lot of negativity regarding Honest Hearts in this thread... It is pretty disheartening because I really like Honest Hearts. Yeah, sure, the quests are not breaking any barriers, but the main quest did something really different, and, IMO it contains a lot of super interesting background, themes and quotes, from both catholic and the mormon texts. Something we can thank to JE Sawyer, who wanted to do something special and different for the DLC he was directing with the short amount of time (the shortest dev time for any of the four main DLCs).  Many people say the story is not good, and their arguments normally are things like ""it is too short"", ""the quests weren't interesting"" and ""the decision near the end has an obvious solution."" And I guess those are valid points for not liking it, but, some of them are, IMO, not true, and are comparing the worth of the story just for the amount of hours it keeps them entertained, or just because it didn't gave you the same amount of options a fully fledged game would give you. And I think the people that think the main quest has an obvious solution (killing the White Legs) are the same people that think Caesar's Legion have no worth at all, despite them using their methods when they choose to destroy the White Legs.  At this point I'm just ranting and venting, but, please, I urge people to respect Honest Hearts for things other than the loot."
fnv,3e15ew,conker_27,13,Tue Jul 21 06:23:57 2015 UTC,"My only criticism of Honest Hearts is that I wish there'd been a pro-Legion option - it would have been cool to meet and work for an anthropologist frumentarius who was out there to kill Graham/assimilate the White legs. A legion camp high in the cliffs with some quests would have been a good move.  E: Damn, a quest to assassinate Graham where you get privately commended and rewarded by Caesar when you return to the wasteland would be fantastic."

fnv,3e15ew,nastibrutishort,3,Tue Jul 21 06:51:01 2015 UTC,"I thought the second point was totally valid, but the first one confused me. Maybe he was referring to the fact that DLC is very difficult to get to interact with the main game in the engine.   I think the only instances of this happening are conversations with Veronica and a secret ending in Dead Money, and it seemed like a ton of work, from their part. If you play the game in Spanish and talk to Veronica about Elijah there is a 75% chance your game will crash, it goes to show how difficult it was implementing DLC stuff into the main game."

I was still kinda in 'kill everything' mode from the fight and was just shooting blindly at anything that looked remotely like the White Legs.  I ended up doing the real fast path to get out of there, and thinking that Honest Hearts was just a freeroam thing without any story.  Then I eventually read the wiki and realized...  I sometimes still do that, cause I don't really like the story that much, and farming white legs for their weapons is really profitable, and Chalky really has it coming..."

I find it unnecessary since the repair parts for Ulysses's duster (leather armors) are very common.

And you'll be just as confused as you are now.   Just go to the Youtube and search how to play caravan. It's so much simpler to learn when you watch someone playing the game while he explains it to you."
fnv,3dxznd,billyboy1912,2,Mon Jul 20 21:45:45 2015 UTC,"You need to have a value between 21 - 26 in your trading routes. At least 2 trading routes need to be higher than your opponents. If a route is higher than 26 it counts as 0 as far as the mechanics are concerned.  Cards 1 - 10 add to the value of your route.  Face Cards such as Jack, Queen, King and Joker have specialised mechanics that change up how the game is played.   Jack removes a single card from play. Queen changes the active suit and direction of the cards. King Doubles any card. Joker removes all cards of the same value from the game, when played against an ace it removes all cards removes all other non-face cards of the ace's suit from the table.   You can play Face cards on the opponents side of the table. Each character has their own way of playing the game. Johnson Nash in Primm for example has a lot of Jacks and Kings in his deck so he can easily mess with your cards.  There are a lot of interesting video tutorials on how to play the game aswell. As a rule the deck I use in Caravan has a lot of 10s, 9s, 7s and 6s with at least 4 of each face card (one of each suit) and one joker and this seems to be a good all round deck to use. You want to have at least 1 of each card in your deck however as the ace can come in really hand if you have a joker in your hand.  The best way to learn the game is to save before challenging someone to a game of Caravan and messing around until you get the hang of it. There is a tutorial in the pipboy if you ask Ringo in Goodsprings to teach you how to play, he also gives you a lot of cards you get you started. I find that caravan is easier to play with a controller.  Edit: Ringo not Chet"

fnv,3dxznd,pythor,2,Mon Jul 20 21:38:05 2015 UTC,"It's been a while...  If I remember correctly, the idea was that when you set up your deck, discard everything that isn't a 10, 9, or 7.  Preferably you'll have 3 of each of those, but I think that's not enough cards, so you might need more.  Then, play the your three piles with one of each card, which will give you 26 on each, so you win."
fnv,3dxznd,_Dotty_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:47:34 2015 UTC,"This strategy doesn't always win. Some opponents have a lot more Jacks than others. If you don't have a ton of 7's, 9's or 10's, it's pretty tough to win this way.  I personally like to have 2 combos to make 26. I use the 10/9/7 and the 10+King/6. I mostly play Jacks defensively and a lot of the Kings I have are used to screw up my opponents caravans."

fnv,3dsrv8,ziberoo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:18:00 2015 UTC,"I'd say there's three options as far as luck/criticals go:  1 Luck - Completely ignore criticals and all related perks, wearing as heavy armor as you want. Explosives work well on this kind of build since they don't get critical bonuses anyway.  6 Luck - Sniper build, taken purely to meet the 'Better Criticals' perk requirements. Since sneak-attack criticals are guaranteed, all perks and equipment that raise your crit chance can be ignored. Armor choice only factors in as far as lighter options being easier to sneak in, but you're otherwise fine using medium or heavy armor. Guns work better here since none of the energy weapons are silenced.  10 Luck - Light armor only for the 'Light Touch' perk, boone's beret for headgear, Finesse, etc. Basically a glass cannon build; you'll rip enemies apart when using weapons that have high critical bonuses.

fnv,3drosm,Kingskywarp,11,Sat Jul 18 20:24:42 2015 UTC,"First of all. Sell multiples of a weapon (or repair it) caps are a necessity and having them will help you out here. Loot whatever you can. Since you have the rocket fuel I would assume that you have gotten a fair ways into the ""come fly with me"" quest. Depending on how you handled the night kin, you should be able to pick up some rebar clubs, these make for good early game money makers. Repair them and then sell them in Novac.  Use your caps to buy more ammo for your weapon(s).  One thing I would suggest would be to pick one weapon that you like and stock up on its ammo. Rather than carry 2 weapons that deal about the same amount of power you only need to carry (and stock ammo for) one gun.  If you are having a hard time getting used to the combat, try to use V.A.T.S. It can make targeting pretty easy, it doesn't require pinpoint accuracy.  Pick a player style and focus on increasing the stats that go with it. Want to be a gunslinger? Raise your gun skill.  Another quick tip. Early on you get a lot of un-armoured enemies. These enemies can be dispatched quite easily with a melee weapon.   As stated by others, go back and do some of the other quests, they help you build your character up and allow you to get used to the game and its mechanics.  And finally. Consult the wiki if you are stuck. There is a lot to do in fallout, and it can be overwhelming especially if you are new to the series. The wiki will cover a lot of some of your questions that you may come across. Many players here who have played multiple characters (me included) still consult the wiki often."

Fuck extra gear, get caps.  Strip every corpse for everything. Someone is bound to buy it.  Stick to the main roads for a while, the wilderness is rough in Vegas.  Invest in guns over lasers, there's more amno and better supply lines.  And most important, have fun and play however you want to play over and over again!

fnv,3drosm,Mryoshi2142,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:20:12 2015 UTC,"It doesn't sound like you need build or gameplay tips at this point but directions... so the best thing to do is to stay in Goodsprings at the start of the game and explore that town, it will have a small tutorial quest which when followed should teach you some basics. After that you should travel south to Primm and then take it from there, you shouldn't enconter any enemies that are too hard and find quite a few quests you can already do and find new equipment.  Generally you probably want to take a ""U"" around the map, first traveling south, then east, then north again.  Also I wouldn't be afraid to toss your progress and start over with a better sense of direction, especially if you're only level 3 or 4 and haven't found anything that special so far."

No: we don't have an ETA.  What's taking so long, I demand service: We need updated icons (EmeraldReign has offered to do these), support for some new, really cool features (underbarrel weapons and Optics of New Vegas support, new reload animations, possibly some other QoL animations) but all of this takes time. I have to re-work and re-export several weapons for the underbarrel weapons and some of the reload animations. We have a completely new kind of underbarrel weapon on the way (also with no ETA) to be added into the pack. The support patches were all updated a long time ago up to a point but the few we've released since then have now out-dated them and they need updating. We require some custom sounds to go with a couple of the reload animations and hopefully YesRoyalty or someone else can pull through for us there.  So there. It's a rather large and important update to the pack and I'm not compromising on pushing it out early because you don't feel like taking the time to learn how to merge the individual esps together. Several of us are working very hard separately to get this thing together and none of us are getting paid to do so. You have alternatives available to you, so please learn how to do them until the update is out or be patient.""  Also, I'll be looking at Gopher's FNVEdit tutorial to see how to merge ESPs!"

You can use That Gun or the 5.56 Pistol  for a stub gun and a police baton for a shock maul.   Otherwise on PC try these. I play an  Arbiter in the tabletop Dark Heresy roleplaying game. I imagine his outfit  looks something like this leather trench coat . However my guy is a detective so that might now fit   . For a more classic arbiter look try this Combat Ranger Armor Mark 2 If you use Project Nevada and want the Night Vision and stuff and I can imagine older Arbiter armor with it you can get a patch The helmet might be a bit New Vegas for your tastes though.  In that case for the most classic  look you can either use a power armor helmet if you get the training or add it by console or you might try the salvaged power helmet which needs no p/a training. This is heavy but DT4 and should be fine balance wise. Its looks quite close.   These are too hard to come by in game without killing NCR so I'd suggest using the player.additem command type  and the item code 0013316b    As for your stub gun as stated That Gun works pretty well and there are tons of mods on the nexus to taste to give it some sense of power. Stubs aren't super powerful being revolvers after all.   The shock maul is basically the alien stun baton from Fallout 3 with a rougher texture. Its in Project Nevada and that seems to be the only way to get it. You can get it at start with this mod I have not tested this and some people report problems. In that case open the console, type coc pnxtestroom grab the shock stick and whatever else you thing you need  or just test them out than select) and type coc goodsprings and viola   Also if you don't like the PN changes to the game, get extra options and just use the Vanilla option in that, Its make the games as it was at start while adding sprint mode, bullet time, dynamic cross hairs and several other feature that modernize the game  Also there is also NV40K I have not tried any of these mods though so I can't couch for them.

""It sure seems risky mining so close to that Wanamingo sanctuary..."" ""Don't worry bout it none. These armed NCR guards won't let anything happen to us. And if they can handle raiders, I'm damn sure they can handle a few mutants."" another miner grumbles in reply. ""Yeah, I guess you're right."" the man sighs before getting back to work swinging his pick at the wall. A tall broad shoulder NCR commander with a pip-boy on his wrist marches into the mine. He is accompanied by two NCR rangers whom look like they have seen every horror in the wasteland imaginable. The commander continues forward and approaches a group of soldiers huddled in front of the vault door. One soldier notifies the others of his presence and they quickly stand up and spin around saluting. ""How comes work getting through the door?"" The commander spouts. His voice is huge, it booms with that sullen, crushing weight of a collapsing star and yet rings true with all the incandescent brilliance that would follow. ""Nearly there sir!

His lifeless body drops to the floor and before the other soldiers can draw their weapons they are stopped by a group of disguised prospectors surrounding them with assault rifles trained on their heads. ""Alright, everyone listen up."" the head of the disguised prospectors steps forward brandishing a remote connected to his waist by a wire. He throws off his duster revealing several rows of dynamite wrapped out around his torso. ""Anybody tries anything stupid, I press this button and turn this mine into a crater!"" One of the disguised prospectors behind him, a young bearded man with a headband tied around his head cringes, clearly afraid of how realistic of an outcome that could be. ""We are the Children of Dharma!"" the dynamite clad man continues, ""and we are here only to kill NCR. As long as everyone else listens to us, you'll be able to walk out of this mine alive.

The other NCR soldiers immediately draw their weapons and a firefight ensues. As bullets zip through the air and bounce off the rocks all around, the miners all drop to their hands and knees to take cover. You see the entrance to the cave not far from where you lay, but before you can make a move toward it, the bomb strapped around the Child of Dharma detonates, exploding a flurry of fire and bloody organs into the air. This sets off a chain reaction, activating the charges on the vault door and blasting it ajar. The rocks above the cavern entrance are jostled loose and crumble down, blocking out the daylight and leaving you trapped in the cave. The headband wearing prospector sees you on the floor and waves you toward him while maintaining fire at the NCR. He shouts for everyone to follow him, claiming he knows of a way out through the vault, before he darts toward the steel door and shimmies through the opening. Once the terrorists are out of sight, the NCR begin to lose their motivation to pursue and start to run off deeper into the cavern. The broad shouldered NCR commander shouts at the cowering miners, claiming that he knows of a better way out, and that if anybody wanted to live, their best bet would be to follow him.

fnv,3dmw6h,Virkoko,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:48:02 2015 UTC,"Leave your armor in safehouse, it's highly probable that you'll find better one very early in Divide.  Take 2-3 weapons with you, you'll get overweighted soon enough.   Stock up hard on ammo, then wait few in-game days and multiply it few times (if you're relying on 5.56 on rocket launchers you can skip that part)  IMHO it's somewhere betwen Honest Hearts and Dead Money if we're talking about difficulty. On one side we got multiple radiation areas and pretty sturdy enemies to perforate, on the other - MRE. It's everywhere, weight comparable to half of my gun, working pretty fast even on HC."

The ""point-of-no-return"" is clearly indicated with a message though. Now, should you get to this point before you do the DLCs? Honestly, it doesn't really matter. Some of the DLCs have a level suggestion, though, I think the highest may be 20? The first one you can really start any time you want, Honest Hearts, after that just go to the area and it'll give you a pop-up about the level recommendation.   The DLCs are mostly standalone from the normal game, there's some references to some DLCs, but it doesn't really matter. The DLCs do have an order though, but this is easy to find with a Google though, I think release order is the simplest and best. A couple have stories tied to each other."

I mean crime across the majority of the Mojave would probably start coming to an end, what with the constant threat of being gunned down by a roaming Securitron.  Eventually, he'd start rebuilding society as best he can... In is own image. He'd tear down anything that didn't fit his idealized version of Vegas from 200 years ago, and mold it until it did. Freeside, just like the Strip before it, would be the next place that all the squatters and less-fortunate would be forced out of at gunpoint.  Eventually (maybe even faster if you throw Old World Blues into the mix) he'd have enough resources to get into space, and reconnect with the orbital satellite networks, likely taking control of every single robot, computer system, and sufficiently advanced machine he could access, using them to take control of that area.  Considering the only people left to stop him are post-apocalyptic survivors with varying tools, weapons, and supplies, it's pretty safe to say he might achieve world domination. Even if the rest of the world is dead.  Don't let him sweet-talk you. House is just as much a Villain as Caesar.  The only difference is that his slaves are electronic.  But still: Cleaner."

I can't remember his exact words in the conversation, but when he speaks with you about his vision for New Vegas and humanity is when I realized I actually agreed with him more than anyone else in the Mojave, and he probably did give humanity it's best long term chance. By the end of the main story the courier is his top lieutenant, and depending on your karma I think the epilogue even says House kinda fears you. Regardless of that though, I feel a courier that sides with House would probably stick with him for a good while after the events of the game, and while House may still be in charge of things, the courier obviously has a good deal of power as well and (assuming the courier is more or less trying to be good and do right by people) enough influence to make sure House doesn't get carried away."

Then one day the courier goes missing. Vanished completely off the face of the mojave. House sends securitrons all over the wasteland looking for the Courier, from Zion to the Long 15. However there is one who is not so eager to find him. Victor, jealous at no longer being the most valuable pawn, takes advantage of the courier's absence. Victor kills House and uploads himself into the network taking control of Vegas. By the time the courier returns vegas has been plunged into chaos. The three casinos are now saloon themed. Victor's face is everywhere as every securitron is bearing his likeness, but rather than keeping the peace theyve been progammed to hunt down ""outlaws"" which in victor's eyes is anyone who doesn't fit into his cowboy wonderland.

No messy politics to deal with, no worrying about what the populace thinks of your plans. You decide what you want to do, and you do it. House is very good at predicting future events (with a few glaring missteps). He envisions spaceships colonizing new planets in 100 years' time, so 50 years out he's halfway to that goal. He's building infrastructure. He's reducing or eliminating crime. He's got the trains built and he's got them by god running on time.  The drawback of a dictatorship is that the citizens have very little to no freedom to live their lives as they choose. They will be bent to House's will, and while it may be argued that society as a whole will benefit from his iron fist -- colonizing the stars, and all -- individuals living under his regime will not necessarily benefit. If House sees you as a threat to his plans, he will simply have you removed. There will be no trial, there will be no defense. If House believes that it suits his plans for you to perform slave labor in one of his steel factories, then that is how you will spend your days.  So ultimately: The Mojave develops infrastructure and rockets, perhaps quite literally, into a new space age. But the citizenry will suffer in service to this goal."

fnv,3dj32z,chadunn13,7,Thu Jul 16 18:04:17 2015 UTC,Dead Money had such an amazing setting and backstory and characters. Absolutely loved it.    You could play any DLC in any order as long as Lonesome Road is last.
fnv,3dj32z,58time,5,Thu Jul 16 19:13:31 2015 UTC,"Honest Hearts for sure. I dont play dead money anymore, just dont like anything about it besides the characters. HH is a little shorter compared to the rest but worth it, good story, a lot to do, good loot, and if your playing a gun build youll like the thompson and the 1911. You can do HH pretty early like lvl15 if I remember right."
fnv,3dj32z,BudOnSteam,3,Thu Jul 16 18:20:32 2015 UTC,The game recommends level 15 but you can literally start at level 10. There isn't much combat if you just rush through it. I use the DLC to boost my character up a few levels. Oh and the Survivalist's Rifle is a must!

OWB is probably the funniest piece of gameplay I've ever had the privilege of experiencing, but Lonesome Road caps off the story better and is generally really emotionally satisfying. So it's a tossup of whether you want the natural ending point to the DLC continuity or the funniest/biggest DLC for last."

And you guessed it, already used a lot, mostly due to I'm on an energy weapon character, and have the Meltdown perk(If you can even call it a perk in some cases), and those stupid cyberdogs and nightstalkers don't know anything about personal space= lots of crippled limbs.  I guess I should start trying to stock up on a metric crapton of empty syringes, broc flower and xander root, huh?"
fnv,3dj32z,mikeke,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:29:45 2015 UTC,"Actually OWB is much easier as an energy weapon character as most of the ammo laying around is for energy weapons.   I remember my first playthrough, playing as a Guns character and running out of ammo for all of my weapons constantly. There is a lot of magnum ammo laying around too, but the only weapon there that could use it was the Cyberdog Gun (that depletes your ammo like crazy), never found a magnum there. So if you went there without a magnum or a cowboy repeater you're doomed to run out of ammo and resort to melee and energy weapons."
fnv,3dj32z,AVestedInterest,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:08:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the advantage particularly was I have the YCS/186, MF Hyperbreeder, and got Elijah's LAER, and I have the Vigilant Recycler perk, and yeah, ammo wasn't much of a problem with the Hyperbreeder especially.

Rad related perks are all basically useless due to the rarity in the Mojave vs the Capital. It'd require a major world space redesign, or a severe cull of sources of RadAway for them to be useful.

He's completely insane.  There's not much more to it than that.  His loquaciousness and that gravelly voice create the illusion of depth, but when you really think about what he's saying there's little rational substance there.  That of course leads to the question of whether he's supposed to not really make sense, or if Obsidian thought his ramblings were genuinely deep.  Oh, here's another fun one; is the player character really the courier who sustained and destroyed the Divide, or is that just the belief of an insane unreliable narrator?  Given the nature of Ulysses obsession, it's not hard to imagine him having some sort of mental break, and projecting the personification of his hate onto Courier 6 when he saw the name after his on the list.

I took it as him wanting to destroy the two monolithic powers that roll through and snatch up all the smaller tribes in their way, re-making them in their image. He was a Twisted Hairs tribe member before his conversion, and he is disgusted that he helped give other tribes the same fate. He also knows the Legion would have never come to exist without the NCR.   You were convenient to him as a way of guiding the key to the launch (ED-E), not the main catalyst for his motivation personally but by action alone. He sees you as a bumbling tool, one that just happens to be more employed by the NCR than the Legion. He knows you probably didn't mean to mess up the divide so badly by just doing your job, he mostly blames NCR for meddling with old world tech (Hence the nukes coming their way). In the Divide he saw a community that could possibly keep the legion and NCR from tearing at each other, one that could discard the negatives of both but keep the positives, but after its destruction he sees nuclear fire as a reasonable back-up to destroy the playing field if it can't be evened."
fnv,3dh525,AutumnInNewLondon,5,Thu Jul 16 20:53:54 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong. Ulysses's story is so interesting, and using multiple DLC to tell it in the setting (sort of) is, I think, a fairly novel approach. The problem is that it just so buried in all the minutiae and little bits that the casual player is going to miss most of it and end up confused at the end of Lonesome Road.   I think that the story would work better as the central plot of the game. Couriers with a shared past on either side of an explosive conflict. I think that's kind of what they tried with the DLC. You see the aftermath of another Courier walking the wasteland, much like the trail you (the Courier) leave throughout the Mojave. It's just that the conflict is buried."
fnv,3dh525,CpntBrryCrnch,3,Thu Jul 16 06:37:25 2015 UTC,"he is half crazy(needs to be put down, surely)   BUT  he speaks of the Legion as needing something to fight against, in order for it to survive. Hence when he tells me he will destroy the NCR(which I was a part of) he is also telling me that it will serve to destroy the Legion as well.(which he was a part of) He both wants this, and does not.   He talks about the NCR being built on symbols and flags of the old world. The United States. But it does not actually have the same values that the US does, or did. He views this as a very bad thing, that the NCR is basically a much corrupted US where politicians only care about who pays for what and their own cut(not that the current states is amazing-no flame wars, please) But Ulysses was a tribal, he recognizes Caesar as leader and had no problems with their...shit.  Ullyses is angry, because the Divide was 'pure' and somehow he decided that you killed it. Thus, you must suffer as he thinks he has suffered.   It is a bit whacky, not always very easy to follow.

So that With every piece the story gets bigger and bigger.  I mean lonesome road would be boring if he just tells you everything at the end.  And I mean really everything.  Also I played with a long list of mods so that took me days to get to the end.  The linear part is that bad. For me it fits the story.  I mean you should come to him.

fnv,3dh525,GamerUnderDevelopmen,2,Thu Jul 16 07:32:49 2015 UTC,"A lot of these responses are pretty surface level to be honest. If you resolve Lonesome Road with Ulysses surviving it makes a lot more sense. Ulysses discovered the courier's settlement as a Frumentarii. He saw the location as a sign of hope and it flew the old world flag. He admired what the courier had built... and considered this society more likely to succeed than either Caesar's Legion or the NCR. Just as he began to believe the Courier and his society we're the future... the Courier brought a package from Navarro that woke the nukes and turned the society into the divide.  Ulysses was saved by an ED-E unit that survived the destruction in a bunker. They brought Ulysses back and he dawned the old world flag. He was driven half-mad by this but it really just increased his vision so to speak. He believes that if the NCR wins the Mojave dies a slow rotting death from corruption (this is supported by several quests in game) and he believes that the Legion will fall into Anarchy when Caesar passes away. From his perspective there is nothing but suffering left for the Mojave and it needs to be wiped clean.  However when he sees the courier he realizes that he needs to face him and so he lures you through Lonesome Road to bring him the ED-E he needs to launch the bombs. If you manage to keep him alive he let's you make the final decision who to hit (I hit both to be honest). This is because he believes the Courier is the only one with the strength of conviction to lead the Mojave.  For those simply dismissing him as mad, nothings ever that simple. Also I would say the character is excellently representing a mind that has suffered through essentially two genocides of everything he held dear. He lost the twisted hairs and his hope for the Mojave."

fnv,3dgn9z,Dubstep_squid,3,Thu Jul 16 12:23:59 2015 UTC,"So I did it in this order, it kind of leads up to all of the characters before their intro in DM.  Honest Hearts:  do this around level 10, it is not very challenging except for the occasional Yao Guai gangbang.  Bring lots of ammo as there is almost none to be bought or found in Zion.  Old World Blues:  do this at around level 20-25. I'd recommend that prior to this putting skill points into Science, energy Weapons and melee.  It is very dialogue heavy with some conversations lasting up to twenty minutes but do not breeze through it, it is important.  IMPORTANT:  At some point before Dead money get the Perk that involves Blood Sausage.   This is an aid item that will be found on most body's that acts as a mini stimpak it helps SOOO much and is 10 x better than the cannibal perk because there is no karma Loss and you can store it for later use  Dead Money:  do this at around level 30 but after completing OWB you should be high enough to complete it.  Before coming here DEFINITELY put points into Melee, sneak and repair.  There are pretty much no guns here IIIRC.  It is one of the best and most challenging DLC's.  I personally recommend doing this after OWB not only because it'll give you that extra time to put skill points where you need them, but also because most of the characters are subtly introduced and mentioned in OWB.  It is much cooler to go in with that curiousity rather than just kind of begin like cool when they're mentioned in OWB.  Lonesome road:  complete this anytime after dead money.  This is meant as a conclusion to the arcing story throughout all of the DLC and should always be completed LAST.  I'd put points mainly into guns, medicine or whatever you use, at this point your character should be pretty OP.  I would go in there with at least some sort of sniper rifle (preferably anti material rifle and DEF splurge and buy the round types) as there are deathclaws galore.  Make sure you have some explosives as well as some sort or short/medium range weapon. IIRC there is plenty of ammo to be looted but none to be bought so stock up on .50 cal and any hard to find ammo.    I'm guessing your a semi new player so if you have any other questions or even any comments just reply, I love to talk about fallout so this is my jam."
fnv,3dgn9z,Dubstep_squid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:45:01 2015 UTC,"hahaha ""semi-new"" is the right way to put it. I've completed fallout 3 and all the DLC, its my favorite game ever. I just got around to playing new vegas a few weeks ago.   Thanks for the info, I might make a new character to run honest hearts at 10ish (im around lvl 23).I actually do have a few questions if you don't mind answering them.  How does breaking down ammo and making new ammo work?  I'm thinking of trying hardcore mode, I've heard it makes it a bit like playing the sims the way you have to monitor your food/water intake.Have you played hardcore and did you find it fun or was it as tedious as many people say?   I was also wondering if there were any interesting locations/gun/people to go/find/talk that you would recommend? (like republic of dave in fo3) Thanks, for the info. I love fallout so it's always fun to talk to anyone who would call it their ""jam"" :)"
fnv,3dgn9z,Dubstep_squid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:24:05 2015 UTC,"Breaking down ammo IMO is pretty useless as I have never used it.  What I always do if I have to is use the workbench to recycle spent energy cells.  Hardcore mode is pretty difficult at first but as you go on and get to the higher levels it just kind of becomes a box to check as you get into a routine.  Combat is the only real hard part because if you cripple a limb or your head it can get really hard really fast.  I personally use mods to make the game much harder (idk what system you're on but the mods make a helluva difference; I can recommend some if u happen to be on PC)  And honestly there are no strangely unique locations like the republic of Dave or canteberry commons.  New Vegas supplements these strange places with over 10X the quests of FO3.  Because there are so many quests I'll name some of the really cool ones and how to help start them as they lead you to the coolest locations in the game.   Hidden Valley Brotherhood of Steel Bunker:  Now you do get to visit this if you follow the Yes Man's quest.  However, if you meet Veronica at the 188 Trading Post (she is one of the coolest, chilliest, funniest and most OP companion you can get)  she can get you in there early on.   The Thorn:  this is in Westside if you go down a sewer I believe.  I missed this on my first 3 Playthroughs before accidentally stumbled upon it.  It is basically an underground fight club with animals so it's pretty unique. Enclave Remnants base:  by having arcade Gannon as a companion and going to certain points you can initiate the quest ""For Auld Lang Syne"" which will have you gathering what remains of the enclave in the Mojave.  Also you get some sweet ass armor when you finish it.   Most of the coolest points you can run into are simply done by playing the main quest.  I found a bunch more by doing No Fast Travel play throughs which are actually surprisingly fun."
fnv,3dgn9z,Dubstep_squid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:40:17 2015 UTC,It's funny you mention the hidden bunker because I went there for Caesars mission to blow up the base. I'm not really sure how you were supposed to do it. I read a lot of people snuck around and stole the cards but they where hostile when I went in there so I just killed people till I found 2 of the cards. While looking for the third I realized I killed every single person and all I had to was leave the bunker.
fnv,3dgn9z,Fisdenallus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:14:34 2015 UTC,The brotherhood is a pretty cool faction in this game (cooler than Lyons pride in FO3 for me) Veronica makes the faction so much better and serves as comic relief for the brotherhoods sad story.

I had gotten to the point where I needed something from that old lady who has what you need to send the ghouls off on the rockets....WELL...she was the only thing standing between me and completing the mission and i just snapped.  I asked nicely if she could sell said thing at a discount but she refused and i said ""you know what bitch..."", stood back a couple feet and grenade launched the shit out of that cunt and her dogs. It was horrible. There were parts everywhere. I laughed, I cried, I got what I needed then proceeded to get mauled by the rest of the dogs hiding in the building behind her. I was not expecting that.  And ever since then, it's all gone down hill. All of freeside and some of the surrounding areas hate me because I maaay have killed almost everyone, I lie every chance I get, I steal alot, and I'm usually an asshole when conversing with others...for example:   When I entered the Ultra Luxe, the door man asked ""can I trouble you to hand over your weapons sir?""

Edit: You craft ""science"" items (repair kits, bombs, etc) at workbenches.  You craft (or take apart) ammo at reloading stations.  Food, poison, and chems are done at campfires.    Go to Goodsprings.  See those two tables outside of Chet's General Store? The wooden one with red parts is the reload station.  The metal one with blue parts is a workbench.    All three crafting spots have a list of things you can make, what ingredients you need, and what level of skill you need.  If you lack an ingredient or have too low of the required skill, the item will be grayed out, but you can see what you're missing.  If you want to make a Weapon Repair Kit, but don't have Duct tape, scroll down the list of grayed out items (it's alphabetical) and you'll see that it's the one item missing.   If you want to make Stimpacks, go to a workbench, get broc flower, Xander root, and an empty syringe.  But wait, it won't let you make it? Scroll down to ""Stimpack""  in the grayed out area.  You have the ingredients right, but on the side you see (for example) ""Medicine 40/50"". You're 10 medicine skill points too low to craft it.    I simplified it as much as I could, but if you really are having trouble understanding this, maybe you should check the Fallout wiki.  It's a little better at hand-holding."

If you need to know more (like weapon spread, VATS cost, exact crit damage, etc) check the Fallout wiki.   Or you could just download WMX from the New Vegas Nexus.  It allows you to attach mods to the unique versions of weapons.  The Gobi Rifle, for example, can use Sniper Rifle mods.  This Machine can use Battle Rifle mods, etc."
fnv,3ddix6,AJockeysBallsack,2,Wed Jul 15 20:59:21 2015 UTC,"It varies by weapon but for the most part, a unique weapon with a mod that increases a stat will increase it more than the same mod on the base one.

fnv,3ddix6,chadunn13,4,Wed Jul 15 12:48:50 2015 UTC,"Also, most unique weapons cannot be modded, and many have effects you can't get from mods.  From the wiki:   Compared to a normal sniper rifle, the Gobi Campaign scout rifle does slightly more damage, has a higher DPS, has less weapons spread, fires more rapidly, degrades more slowly and has greatly increased critical hit damage. Its reduced Action Points cost can also be very useful for squeezing an extra shot into a V.A.T.S. sequence."

It doesn´t sound that good, but when you start stacking crit chance with thing like the 1st recon beret, finesse and high luck, you will notice.  I agree that armor balance and armors in general are done very poorly in new vegas. There really isn´t that much variety, you either go full DT with power armor or max crit with light touch and light armor.

fnv,3d5q71,autowikibot,2,Tue Jul 14 03:26:02 2015 UTC,"Section 7. Basic strategy of article  Blackjack:       Each blackjack game has a basic strategy, which is playing a hand of any total value against any dealer's up-card, which loses the least money to the house in the long term.  An example of basic strategy is shown in the table below, and includes the following parameters:    Four to eight decks The dealer stands on a soft 17 A double is allowed after a split Only original bets are lost on dealer blackjack   Key:   S = Stand  H = Hit  Dh = Double (if not allowed, then hit)  Ds = Double (if not allowed, then stand)  SP = Split  SU = Surrender (if not allowed, then hit)   The bulk of basic strategy is common to all blackjack games, with most rule variations calling for changes in only a few situations. For example, if the above game used the hit on soft 17 rule, common in Las Vegas Strip casinos, only 6 cells of the table would need to be changed: double on 11 vs. A, surrender 15 or 17 vs. A, double on A,7 vs. 2, double on A,8 vs. 6, surrender(if not allowed, then hit) on 8,8 vs. A. Also when playing basic strategy never take insurance or ""even money.""   Estimates of the house edge for blackjack games quoted by casinos and gaming regulators are generally based on the assumption that the players follow basic strategy and do not systematically change their bet size. Most blackjack games have a house edge of between 0.5% and 1%, placing blackjack among the cheapest casino table games. Casino promotions such as complimentary matchplay vouchers or 2:1 blackjack payouts allow the player to acquire an advantage without deviating from basic strategy.

Edit: What I'm assuming is happening to you is that youre trapping Elijah in the vault area. If you remain undetected from him while he walks to the terminal outside the vault he will raise blue shields essentially trapping himself.

fnv,3d4drx,Raccoon_Farmer,30,Mon Jul 13 12:47:47 2015 UTC,"Do not start with Lonesome Road. It's designed from a story standpoint to be a wrap-up to the Courier's tale in a way, and I think it will not be satisfying if you do it first. Also, it's IMO the toughest DLC and you may want to wait until you're higher-level to do it.  Opinions are mixed on Dead Money. It's got a different feel from the rest of Fallout in that it's basically a survival horror game with a lot of game mechanics that some people find challenging but many other people find annoying and frustrating. You may want to hold off on it.  So that leaves Old World Blues and Honest Hearts. Honestly, from a story standpoint I'd suggest Honest Hearts first, then OWB. I think it flows more logically that way, for slightly spoilery reasons I don't want to divulge. That said, you can really play them in either order, and if you are only going to play ONE dlc, I'd suggest Old World Blues, because it's my all-time favorite."

It's the first release and story wise, but it does have a different feel to it. For me it was a great slow burn to the start of a journey that culminated with Lonesome Road.  OWB might me touted to you as being loot-tastic,  but I would say that it spoils a certain element of the mystery in DM.   If you're going to go non-chronological with it I'd recommend Honest Hearts.

There's no way to make one of the main gameplay elements (you'll know it soon enough) less frustrating. Ignoring the frustrating gameplay mechanic, the game is actually fun but a bit repetitive at times. The story is great. The characters are engaging. The main enemy is great.

Don't go into OWB until at LEAST lvl 15, you want to get all the ammo you can before going, because normal gun ammo is pretty scarce in that dlc.  I would go around and get all the snowglobes and turn them into Mr. House, for about 14000 caps, then buy all the mods and ammo you can find for your sniper. (I also recommend getting some sort of weapon for close range encounters, a pistol or shotgun, but it's not necessary.)  If you have all the DLC, then for armor I would suggest Joshua Grahams armor from Honest Hearts (do this DLC first if you have it, it's fairly easy and shouldn't be a problem for low levels) until you can get the elite riot gear in Lonesome Road.

I've managed it thus far, to 12th level or so but its a pain in the neck even with the stun weapons that are part of the mod it just takes too long to knock foes  down and cuff or tie them.   One foe, two now with my modified cattle prod are doable but at a cost and its often not worth the trouble. Some things are simply not really doable IMO , for example Primm. Granted I have more than the usual number of convicts do to mods but in order to clear the area I needed a companion, in my case an NCR ranger,   In regular FNV no mods, I wouldn't even try it the game engine and play style doesn't support it and you miss out on a lot of loot and quests ( Goodsprings for example   )  However ye olde Good natured/skilled tags speech, barter and something not a weapon skill avoids killing people works fine.   The key is to avoid fights, run when you can and use less lethal weapons when you can. This does work well enough and you can keep the body count to sane levels."
fnv,3d3dr6,ABProsper,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:37:45 2015 UTC,"Primm is very doable within these parameters. Step 1: Run past everyone.

The lever action is a decent choice in that it's got the best DPS of any 20-gauge. 20ga shells are cheap and plentiful. The gun may be slow to reload, but if you use the melee kill tactic against downed enemies you won't be reloading in the heat of battle anyway: you'll just be emptying the mag in the target's face before switching to your melee weapon; switch back for the next enemy and your shotgun will be reloaded already.

I personally only play by release order for sentimental reasons (I spent like 10 months with a friend analysing every detail of each DLC as they came out, speculating about the characters' past and future, etc) but that order still makes a lot of sense.   If you like stories that reveal something after the fact and make you think 'OOOH, that's what it meant!' then release order is better for having DM before OWB."

fnv,3cz3yo,Iamabioticgod,5,Sun Jul 12 02:25:49 2015 UTC,"I´d say level 25+ for Lonesome Road and 20+ for the others.  Honest hearts: Bring lots of hollow point ammo if possible. The dlc is teeming with dangerous wildlife.  Animals have no DT, so the extra damage will be worth it.   Old World Blues: Depending on your level the enemies will be massive bullet sponges. Bring TONS of ammo (seriously, like thousands). If you are a melee character or even if you are not, the proton axe is your best friend. It deals good damage and stuns robots, so it´s amazing for saving ammo and killing the majority of enemies there.  Lonesome Road: You can leave the dlc area at any time, so preparation isn´t as important since you can just come back and restock on anything you need. That said, be prepared for the most difficult combat encounters the game has to offer. Long range engagements will serve you well. Save up a few stealth boys for the bridge (you can manage with good positioning and weapons, but just incase it proves too difficult, just stealth it up and skip the bridge).  Dead Money: Prepare to be irritated and annoyed. Stealth and sneak attack criticals are your friends here. If the enemy spots you, get ready to use up a lot of ammo, because they are also massive bullet sponges. Don´t rely on melee or headshots, and every time you ""kill"" one, hack off a limb so they don´t get back up. Explore the police station very thoroughly, there is a vending machine code for .308 ammo and it´s invaluable."
fnv,3cz3yo,Sublime-Heretic,3,Sun Jul 12 08:38:53 2015 UTC,"Honest Hearts: Maybe it's a spoiler, but I don't want you to lose anything: there will be a decision on the main quest with a character named Daniel. If you choose an option, all the active side quests will be failed, so be sure to do every side quests before!  And you can go back to Zion at any time once the quest is ended.  Dead Money: Go slowly and pay attention to everything. Explore too, cause once you finish the DLC, you can't go back.  Old World Blues: I highly recommend to explore everything, and that means exploring the dialogue options carefully as well: many things from the New Vegas lore are explained in this DLC.  You can get back to Big MT at any time once the main quest is ended.  Lonesome Road: Don't underestimate the enemies in this DLC: they can kick your ass easily. Lonesome Road felt like a straight quest to me: you can do it in one sit if you're prepared.  You can go back to the Mojave at anytime in the main quest."

If you do have that perk, you're in for a hellish experience that's two degrees less hot. Also, think very critically in dialogue... There is one occasion where passing a skill check in dialogue here can be detrimental to you in the long run. Don't sweat on missing out on anything due to this one skill check, though.  Honest Hearts: When you first arrive at your destination, triple check on who's firing at you before shooting. A friendly face will appear amongst the enemy ranks, and shooting that friendly person will pretty much fail the whole DLC quest. Also, there's an unmarked quest in this DLC involving a long series of computer terminals. Good reading in 'em.  Old World Blues: Progress the main story of this DLC to get a special weapon that will let you access more areas. Some light Metroid-vania aspects to be found here. Almost every area has an item that will upgrade your safe-haven hub area.  Lonesome Road: Take care to prepare yourself. This DLC is the ultimate challenge.

fnv,3ctnet,Songbottom,2,Fri Jul 10 18:22:32 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it doesn't act as a totally different game in your library. That's why everyone's account says ultimate edition whether they have the DLC or not. For the record I bought the UE from another store and it simply downloaded the DLC into the existing install.  Having said that, I don't know if there's a quirk in Steam's store that prevents you from buying a game it thinks you already own - in that case, you can probably buy it as a gift and redeem it to your own account.

fnv,3ct0y5,Heyne,4,Fri Jul 10 18:00:50 2015 UTC,"By the way, where exactly did you get that in the equation?   If you take a look at the 3 equations before the final damage calculation you will see that Dam adj1 only includes base damage, crit and crit perks. (we can ignore special damage and DR since our opponents don't have a DR and guns don't have specials).  In the 3rd equation we subtract adjusted DT(in this case multiplied by 3). And we take this value and add all the perk and ammo bonuses (unless it's less then 20% of Dam adj1)."
fnv,3ct0y5,Heyne,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:31:35 2015 UTC,"Oh! The subtraction of DTadjust includes the multiplier. Ok, I'd seen that but hadn't connected the dots. Makes sense now, thank you."
fnv,3ct0y5,PetroarZed,3,Fri Jul 10 19:15:07 2015 UTC,"Finally some theorycrafting. Love it. ;)  Hollow Point DT multiplier is applied BEFORE the perk, ammo etc. multipliers.  So if the weapon deals 78 damage you will need to subtract DTx3 before multiplying the result with cowboy, HP bonus etc.  In your example this means the DT to lower the damage to 0 is 26. (78/3)  Since damage can't be reduced to less than 20% of the initial damage a DT of 21 is enough to reduce the Hollow Point damage to the minimum.  This only applies to non Crits, though. The critical damage is applied to the initial calculation as well - before the subtraction of the 3xDT making Crit insanely valuable against armored targets."
fnv,3ct0y5,PetroarZed,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:12:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. 21 is on the upper range of the speculative numbers I had seen before; with your two expositions it's all pretty clear now. I'll save the HPs for tough animals with no DT like Cazadors and Nightstalkers and use the Hand Loads for the rest, given they're also easier to get.  Thanks for the info, buddy!  P.S.: You seem pretty knowledgeable. How do you feel about shotguns in FNV?"
fnv,3ct0y5,Heyne,3,Fri Jul 10 19:20:07 2015 UTC,"If you pick up Shotgun Surgeon for the -10 DT they can be worth it, as they'll apply nearly their full damage in most cases.  However, the overall gameplay still tends to favor rifles and other long range weapons, since so much of the game's combat takes place outside, and shotgun mechanics tend to favor short range, indoor fights.  They'd be a great weapon in Tale of Two Wastelands, with the extensive interior combat of the Capitol Wasteland.  I'd suggest not taking And Stay Back, since it's completely overpowered, giving a 10% knockdown chance per pellet.  It's TOO good a perk, and will make an already easy game into snorefest."
fnv,3ct0y5,Heyne,2,Fri Jul 10 20:28:42 2015 UTC,"Interesting. That's how I feel too mostly - rifles are more practical for the majority of the game. However -   they'll apply nearly their full damage in most cases.   Really? I was under the impression that most enemies had 20 - 25 DT, which negates all shotguns I am aware of (Even Big Boomer has 10 DAM per pellet, plus perk dealing 20 for DT calculations, still below threshold).  Am I overstating Npc DT here or is it something else?"
fnv,3ct0y5,Yumad73,2,Fri Jul 10 20:39:39 2015 UTC,"It varies, but a lot of enemies sit at 10 or lower.  Most ghouls, Powder Gangers, most raider factions, most NCR troops, lower level Legion, cazadors, geckos, etc.  It's hard to say if it's worth it or not, since there really isn't all that much in the way of hard fights in the game to begin with, and the few there are tend to be one time or easily avoided.  It's hard to really min max in a game that never really pushes that max.  The only (outside of DLC) recurring, attack you anywhere nasty are the faction hitsquads, and I suppose I wouldn't want to try and fight those with a shotgun on a high difficulty setting.  I will say that I enjoy the ""feel"" of clearing a building using a shotgun.  I tend to carry weapons that the game doesn't force me to mechanically; a sniper rifle works just fine as a close combat weapon in pure game mechanics, but I don't like it.  Living Anatomy will let you see the DT of what you're fighting."
fnv,3ct0y5,Crimson1515,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:57:10 2015 UTC,"How do you feel about shotguns in FNV?   Never really tried shotguns. I'm not even sure about the mechanics, sorry."
fnv,3cs02q,burned_some_bridges,12,Fri Jul 10 08:22:22 2015 UTC,"Well, on the gameplay front they're not too different, some skills have been added and some have been removed, but in FNV you get to pick 2 traits (or not, up to you), which are very much in the style of traits from the original Fallouts, IE. You win some, you lose some, the biggest change is that most weapons in FNV has proper iron Sight aiming, instead of the weird slight zoom Fallout 3 used, and FNV gets way more mileage from the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system than Fallout 3 did, as you'll find most skills have more use in conversation, it's also harder to become good at everything, making actual Roleplaying much more viable without having to artificially restrict yourself.  On the topic of stability I can only speak for myself, but Fallout 3 never ran properly for me, I had an ungodly amount of crashes just running vanilla and no amount of fixes ever resolved it to a satisfactory degree, FNV on the other hand has run near perfect in vanilla, most stability issues I've had has been because of mods and the like, though I have had more glitches with critters getting caught in the world geometry and people disappearing, but in most cases fiddling with the console sorts that out, though I should mention some people would claim the exact opposite of what I did, it seems the Gamebryo engine stability is based mostly on the roll of a die.  I think most people here would agree that the story is where the biggest differences are, Fallout 3's story is, well, average, it's predictable as hell and pretty run of the mill, neither good or bad, and unfortunately doesn't allow for much player interaction outside of few specific points, and those things you can change are either inconsequential or handled clumsily, FNV on the other hand has a branching story, you can kill pretty much every single person, and the game still has the capacity to find an ending for you, you can make choices in the main storyline that'll actually have an effect and is much better written, you actually have many reasons to replay the game, whereas in Fallout 3, you don't really have one because the main story line always ends in practically the same way.  Lastly, if you didn't notice, I am not too keen on Fallout 3, hence I am not the best to judge it fairly, that said I think it is dangerous to use a game like Destiny as your benchmark, I haven't played it but it's obvious they're trying to do different things.  Edit: This is terribly written but I don't have the time to rewrite it, feel free to ask if you need clarification on anything and I'll get back to you."

For me New Vegas is the one that's so unstable it's unplayable, whereas 3 runs absolutely fine, even with shit-tons of mods.  Other than that, it's mostly setting and overall tonal differences between the two. 3 focuses more on the whole 1950s vibe that the whole series takes it's stylistic cues from, whereas New Vegas makes it more of a wild-west type game with the 50s stuff coming from the casinos.  There's also the tone of the world. While they're both dark and very disturbing worlds in their own way, New Vegas adds a much more light-hearted side to it with some of the wackier quests and people, whereas 3 is just plain dour all round, choosing to focus on just how badly life is struggling because of the devastation the DC area suffered during the great war."
fnv,3cs02q,Sigourn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:13:44 2015 UTC,"I grabbed Fallout 3 GOTY on the last Steam Summer Sale and have been running it with FOSE/4GB enabler. Haven't had much trouble at all with it so far (The Pitt included). I think I've only had maybe 2-4 crashes altogether (and none of those involving DLC - though I admit, I haven't gotten around to the Mothership DLC, so ""who knows?"" in that case).   It's been a while since I had NV Ultimate Edition installed but I used an ENB preset (""Cobalt"", I believe it is, though it could have just as easily been ""Blackout"", I really don't remember exactly, I used both at various times and I forget which was the nicer/more-stable-on-my-hardware of the two) with the 4GB fix (again), ""New Vegas Anti Crash"" (I think it was called), and various character/lighting/sky/etc mods...because I wasn't trying to change the game or add content that wasn't originally there, I just wanted to make it look nicer aesthetically, if I could (and it did indeed work). Doing so made NV more stable than it was simply installing it vanilla-style, straight from Steam (surprised me too).   The lack of iron sights was kind of weird, having played NV before 3, but I got used to it. I've never had any sort of delay like how you explained, though. Weird.   For what it's worth, I picked up Fallout 1, 2, and Tactics a while back too and I've grown to like them as much as I do 3 and NV. I really wanted and tried to get into Destiny when it came out, but it just doesn't do much for me. Totally my opinion, 100% so, but I would never think to compare Destiny to Fallout (any of them). Granted, Destiny is prettier out-of-the-box, but I couldn't do more than 30-50 hours in Destiny, while if I added up all of my PC and console time, I'm sure I've easily surpassed 1000 hours between 3 and New Vegas (and I have no idea what the total would be if you bring 1, 2, and Tactics into the equation).   Note: I'm running this on an Acer Aspire laptop, i7, 8GB RAM, Nvidia Geforce GT 750M. It's not as if I have a massive, purpose-built gaming setup. Works for me (for now).

If you think Obsidian magically started making more stable PC games than Bethesda at some point, you're in for a surprise.

There are some channels which make their builds with console commands so they can crank them out a dozen at a time, but I feel it's necessary to ensure the build can actually play to completion.  For example, I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to complete the Divide carrying only Pew Pew, the 1st Recon Beret, a Wasteland Wanderer Outfit and a stack of stimpaks. Her DT was actually 0 because of the Kamikaze trait, so I would usually die upon detection. But, with a few quicksaves, it turns out to be pretty easy. I mean, you can see she one-shots Rawr in VATS.  I try to make the builds as accessible as possible by using practically no mods. I have Mission Mojave which fixes as many bugs as possible while adding as much original game content back into the game (for example, there's a sequence which was cut of Sheriff Meyers giving a pep talk to some reformed powder gangers before they occupy Primm. Another example is having an empty bottle added into your inventory after drinking a Sunset Sarsaparilla.) The only other mod I have installed lets me skip DLC intros and endings."

With comprehension you can pass 100 skill checks with only 80 + a magazine. The additional skill point from books that give a permanent skill boost is also nice. Shotgun surgeon: essential if you are using shotguns Toughness: always useful Stonewall: situational but very useful, espceially if you are going melee Strong back: not essential, but nice to have Finesse: always take finesse, +5% crit chance is very VERY good Jury rigging: arguably one of the best perks in the game, the bad thing is that it requires 90 repair, but most combat oriented characters usually go 90-100 anyway so it isn´t as bad as it sounds Better criticals: always take it, if you have the stats for it Weapon handling: very good for low-average strength characters, allows the use of the heaviest weapons in the game with only 8 strength Super slam: makes melee/unarmed weapon arguably OP   Good dlc perks:   And stay back: makes shotguns OP Light touch: this is the reason to use light armor instead of medium/power armor. +5% crit chance doesn´t sound much, but when you start stacking crit bonuses it becomes very useful.

The wild wasteland perk is just wonderful because it adds rare and usually great or funny things to the world. I won't spoil some of the things it adds.

There is no DLC for New Vegas that takes the game beyond the campaign ending. You take the game to final quest, the game ends. The nature of the factions and the war makes it so you can't just encounter everyone else like it's no big deal. The story has to end. So you better get all that DLC done before the endgame.  And buy the Ultimate edition for god's sake. Why are you paying full price for packing on DLC to a retail game 5 years after the fact?"

fnv,3cmmor,Songbottom,5,Thu Jul 9 02:17:03 2015 UTC,"15 hours is extremely quick for a game the size of New Vegas.  I suppose you could do it if you focused on nothing else besides the main quests, but that means you are skipping a lot of the side quests that explain the lore.  I can easily see getting frustrated and dying a lot early in the game because Goodsprings is surrounded on several sides by some of the most fearsome creatures in the wastes.    If you decide to give the game another go, I would recommend staying out of New Vegas for a while.  Explore Freeside and the areas surrounding.  In some of my playthroughs, i don't even get into New Vegas until 15 hours into the quest.    I honestly found the most engaging parts of the game to be the stories of the companion characters.  They give a bit of insight into the factions (the Brotherhood, The Enclave, NCR, Legion) some of which have existed since Fallout 1 and 2.  Hope I didn't spoil too much here.  In terms of building a character, what were the parts of the game you liked best?  There is really no wrong way to role play, just keep a goal in mind and try your best to pick perks and skills that fit that style.  I would recommend investing in either lockpicking or science for new characters:  both skills open up a lot of doors (quite literally) that give a ton of extra equipment and content.  Investing in Speech, opens up a lot of extra dialog that you wouldn't ordinarily get, providing further insight into the world"

fnv,3cmmor,kit25,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:46:59 2015 UTC,"As stated by another user, 15 hours is very quickly. My guess is that you stuck strictly to the main quests? Maybe only deviated a little here and there?  Play some side quests. They are a lot of fun, grab some companions, explore buildings. The vaults are quite a bit of fun if you have the science skill to hack the computers. There's a lot of cool backstory that you get out of them.  Exploration is quite fun too. I have put many hours into the game and still find new stuff when looking around.  If you play on PC, try to get some of the steam achievements. This will make you play a much broader game and explore more. The same is true for achievements/trophies on console.  Also, if you are looking for the lore on the whole franchise, check out the wiki. I also believe there is r/falloutlore however I've never checked it out."

Example:   Do the Gun Runners quest for the Crimson Caravan, where you steal GR plans for McLafferty. In Heartache by the Number, turn over the evidence against CC and the Van Graffs instead of killing them. This ending implies that the Gun Runners kill them instead of Cass and the Courier.     Both the Van Graffs and Alice McLafferty were removed from their post in the East. During their trek West, however, their caravan was wiped out by raiders using advanced weaponry and military tactics. No cargo was taken. When questioned, the Gun Runners denied any involvement, claiming they would have no... public motivation for such an attack.   The game is damn near infinite that way.

FO3 Enemies would eventually stop trying to find you and you could get this weird scenario where the enemies would walk all over their dead Friend and act like nothing happened.  In FNV, they see the dead Body and conclude that there must be a killer around. For a while at least, but before they can ""relax"" again another NPC will notice that there's a dead Body and alarm everyone. Possibly the first NPC will alarm himself again and again until that body is ""disabled"" via console or everyone in detectable range of that body is dead; unless their bodies alert someone else.  In Skyrim they won't be necessarily aggressive upon seeing a dead Body. It can get funny anyways when they see someone dead near the end of their patrol.

You can use: Med X - 25% DR Slasher - 25% DR Battle Brew - 35% DR  This will max out your DR at 85%.  So first DR would reduce ALL damage by 85%.  450 damage from the Legendary Bloatfly becomes a measly 67.5 damage.  And then DT would take affect and reduce 48 damage from regular attacks not below 20% of this amount.  This means the most damaging attack in the game capable of one shotting most characters would do... 19.5 damage.  And if you stack healing such as Rad Child.... you can basically be invincible.

Melee/Unarmed is way way stronger against most things in the game than guns.  Guns is superior only against enemies that can kill you really fast deathclaws and to an extent cazadors.  Turbo plus melee/unarmed means even the legendary deathclaw is not a concern. He may have a hard start, but the weakest starts lead to the most powerful finishes.  Plus once he gets the right perks and items, he should have zero trouble with deathclaws and cazadors.  Guns is actually hard mode.

Basically there's a stealth boy in good springs so you use that to run north past the deathclaws and make it to camp McCarran. Steal an ncr uniform from a trunk in the train station. Then take the train for free dressed as ncr to the strip.   Go to the lucky 38 and turn in the snowglobe from good springs cemetary and the one from the lucky 38 bar area. Now you have 4000 caps on the strip at level 1.

fnv,3cfkxw,gyshall,2,Tue Jul 7 16:41:36 2015 UTC,Could you explain this further?
fnv,3cfkxw,maohaze,5,Tue Jul 7 20:36:55 2015 UTC,"8 Intelligence is a ""perfect"" target for the stat in New Vegas in that it is high enough to pass almost all (I think) speech checks and is the sweet spot to give you enough skill points to distribute to max out a number of skills.  The only way to permanently increase your Intelligence stat in the base game is by purchasing the implant.  By starting with 7 Intelligence, you can pump up your Luck to 9, which is far more important for stuff like critical hits/gambling/etc.  Then with the implant, you get to the 8 Intelligence ""Holy Grail"", as it were.  However, to maximize this, you don't want to level until you reach 8 intelligence, in order to maximize skill points.  Thus, you want to reach the strip/freeside as early as possible and acquire the 4k caps to purchase the implant before hitting level 2.  My playthroughs usually look something like this, unless I'm roleplaying a specific build:  Gunman  S 4  P 6  E 7  C 1  I 7  A 6  L 9  Energyman  S 3  P 5  E 7  C 1  I 7  A 8  L 9  Having 7 Endurance is important because it allows you to purchase all of the implants in the game.  I usually take Skilled and Small Frame or Logan's Loophole to min/max this even further.  The min/maxing Skillpoints is especially important with Logan's Loophole.  I start by going to the Goodsprings school, picking the safe there and grabbing the Stealthboy there, which is essential.  Then I either run past the deathclaws or up and around past Chance's Grave to get to an area where I can make it to Vegas.    These days I'm usually playing with a combination of Cirosan's Classic Overhaul, JSawyer, and Vicious Wastes, which allows for less cheese in this regard, since both JSawyer and Vicious Wastes make it much harder to get to Vegas early and punish you for low charisma scores.  Project Nevada's Sprint option also allows for some cheesing where you can outrun a lot of the threats on the way to Vegas."

fnv,3cbt7y,planex09,12,Mon Jul 6 18:13:02 2015 UTC,"1/7 just means that one of the characters in your word was in the right place. It doesn't mean that just the letter is correct, but rather that the letter is correct and in the correct position. In other words, that was a really bad choice of words, avoid anything with similar constructs in future guesses.  My rule of thumb is to look at word endings, like '-ed' or '-ing' or '-ness' or whatever, and if there are several that end in 'ing' (for example) and you choose one, you should at least get a 3/x or the word ending is not in the correct password.  from the fine wiki:   You will be presented with a list of words, all of the same character length, interposed with random characters. The length of the words is determined by the difficulty of the lock. One of the words is the correct password, and your goal is to guess it. You choose a word by clicking on it. If you didn't guess correctly, the terminal will display ""x/y correct"" where x is the number of correct letters, and y is the word length. A letter is correct only if it is in the right spot. For example, if the password is ""RELEASED"" and you choose ""DETECTOR"" then you will be told that there are 2/8 correct because there are 'E's in the 2nd and 4th place for both. The words have other letters in common, like 'R', but it is in the first spot in one word, and the last in the other. You have four attempts to select the correct password. If you have the Computer Whiz perk, you will get another try. This game is similar to Mastermind, a board game.  There are also things you can do with the characters that are not part of words. Clicking on matching brackets (i.e. () [] {} <>, even with other characters between, but not a whole word between) can remove a dud password or reset the number of remaining guesses to four. The brackets must be of the same type and on the same line. Although you cannot match brackets with a whole word between them, you can match brackets separated by the dots that appear when a dud word is removed ( <.......> ). Also, two or more opening brackets can be matched to a single closing bracket (""[ [ ]"" on a line gives you two chances), but the opposite is not true (""[ ] ]"" only gives you one chance). When you scroll across this type of entry from left-to-right, the entire entry will be highlighted letting you know if you've found one or not."

The Kahns are leaving and will not fight for anyone.  The BOS will not align with me because I am independent but, I am running through their quests to get power armor.  All I have left are the 2 casino families."

I'll put the next bit in spoiler tags in case you want to stay totally unspoiled, although it's very mild:  You can definitely survive the dam fight even with no allies at all. It just gives you a little bit of help if you get the Boomers, etc. to show up and a couple of nice little visuals. I really wouldn't sweat it overly."

fnv,3cai0k,JDGumby,3,Mon Jul 6 17:08:57 2015 UTC,They don't stack. But there is a perk you can take that gives you a +20 instead of a +10 boost from magazines.
fnv,3cai0k,Jiryoku,5,Mon Jul 6 17:50:19 2015 UTC,Yeah  Speech checks are more frequent in New Vegas thoughon my latest playthrough I dumped points in speech just to get the terrifying presence perk. Also I am sure there are fewer skills in new vegas than in Fallout 3

Big Guns and Small Guns in Fallout 3 were replaced by Guns and Survival in New Vegas.  There are just as many skills in NV as in 3. What made you think that?   Easy mistake to make.

I wouldn´t even do Honest Hearts if it weren´t for the 3 items you get there that fit my ruleset and playstyle. I´ve also never used the .45 pistol so that alone with my ruleset is enough of a reason for me to do it.

As far as I remember from my previous playthroughs, it´s not going to be nearly enough for everything I want, so I´ll have to see if I´m going to get That Gun.

fnv,3cb7tr,Anmar7779,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:59:23 2015 UTC,"I think armor should not have ""magical"" properties. If you look at existing FNV armor you can notice, that all special properties come from either properties of the material (resistances), advanced tech (+stealth, +STR), accessories (minor skill bonuses), looks (+CHA) and Luck. Minor luck and perhaps radiation factors are the only magic allowed in Fallout universe. Now, how will you justify +20% mele dmg or +50% chem potency on a clothing? PS. I mostly wear BH duster. Armor you mentioned is too OP."
fnv,3cb7tr,Exemplis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:07:16 2015 UTC,"Well you could say the same thing about how you magically deal more damage with a weapon as your skill level goes up. Fallout has never been about realism and it doesn´t have to take itself too seriusly, so personally I wouldn´t mind these ""magical"" effects. You might be right about the fact that most of my ideas are a bit OP, but that wasn´t really the point. The point was giving more variety to players.  Sure if you put some effort into it, you could come up with reasonable explanations for the effects.    Enrage type effects while under 20% health = epinephrine injector?  Reduced recoil/scope sway = mechanical arm/wrist combat stabilizers?  Increased melee/unarmed damage = powered micro exoskeleton? Increased chem effectiveness = Chem additive injector?"

fnv,3ca1cm,lag051183,3,Tue Jul 7 02:52:09 2015 UTC,"Take Logan's Loophole at the start of the game, it locks you in at level 30 and makes sure you don't gain too many skill ups from leveling.  That helps make sure you don't over level skills that you can increase with skill books.    It is entirely doable without Logan's Loophole, I just find it makes life much easier.  Plus it is extremely potent in it's own right.  Once you are ready, remove Logan's Loophole at the auto-doc in the Sink in Old World Blues.  You can only respec traits once, so i hold off until I have all the skill books or am confident I will max all skills."
fnv,3ca1cm,Exemplis,3,Tue Jul 7 05:03:02 2015 UTC,"I'm starting my second visit to Mojave today (I haven's completed my first one couple of years ago - got bored somewhere in the Divide). So here's a quick question: What's the optimal order of completion of quests (after arriving to the Strip), assuming I want to complete maximum number of them or maximum steps of some of them. Smth like ""Debt Collector+Wang Dang Atomic Tango->Heartache by the Number"" and so on, taking into account char lv progression (ie no 80+ skill checks on lv 12). Thanks in advance."
fnv,3ca1cm,Exemplis,3,Mon Jul 6 09:25:12 2015 UTC,"It depends on if your trying to complete the At a Loss For Words, 100 Speech Failures challenge.  There are many other things to consider, such as will you sacrifice Cass to keep the Silver Rush open for business?  I would avoid meeting Benny and starting the main quest line as long as possible.  If you have comprehension skill checks are not a problem, using skill magazines and different chems I never had a single check in the game I couldn't pass when I needed to.  You can hold off doing a quest if you know there is a skill check you can't pass yet.    Also are you going for Meat of Champions secret challenge at all?  If so for the main quest line I would start with Caesar up to where it would break other factions, then do NCR up to where it would break other factions, then do all of Mr. Houses quests.    When you are tasked with protecting the NCR president kill him yourself, this permanently hostiles the NCR though.  It's annoying but I carry an NCR repairman jumpsuit so I can trade with NCR merchants.  And finally kill Mr. House and side with Yes Man.  If you want to do all the powder ganger quests it's doable with siding with Goodsprings.  You just need to make sure you don't kill ANY powder gangers yourself, let the people of Goodsprings do the dirty work.  Then you should be able to finish those quests.  Make sure to do all the Great Khan quests as early as possible, so you don't kill Motor Runner and break one of the quest lines.  I have been doing a full playthrough on my youtube channel showing the path to 100% completion, so definitely check out some of the videos as well to see what order I am doing things.  I managed to do every quest in the game, there are quests that are mutually exclusive but those you can't count as missed because you either get to do one or the other never both."
fnv,3ca1cm,Exemplis,3,Mon Jul 6 10:07:58 2015 UTC,"Nice video btw! Now back to the completion order. Until what moment do you usually stall main questline? Edit: and at what stages do you abandon faction questlines for Legion, NCR and House?"
fnv,3ca1cm,Exemplis,2,Mon Jul 6 12:44:58 2015 UTC,"I would stall main quest line until you have done Lonesome Road, that way you can nuke NCR and Caesar Legion and then start main quest line and reset the infamy gained.  Caesar: Stop working for him when he tells you to kill House.  Make sure to max rep out by turning in NCR dog tags.  Easiest way to get dog tags is to repeatedly stealth kill NCR soldiers.  You can also pick pocket, but that takes longer.  NCR: Complete How Little We Know by siding with Cachino but do not turn it in to the NCR.  Mr. House: Complete everything up to How Little We Know, turn it in to Mr. House.  Mr. House: Complete all his quests, make sure you have max positive rep with NCR and start You'll Know When It Happens.  Kill the president yourself at the end of his speech.  You will now be Wild Child with NCR and flagged hostile permanently (carry NCR Repairman Jumpsuit). Now finish all House's remaining quests and when he gives you the final end game quest...  Yes Man: Kill Mr. House and install Yes Man.  This gives you the most quests completed.  Downside is you do you to wipe out the Brotherhood of Steel, so if that is something you don't want to have happen instead of starting House's quests follow Mr. Houses quests up to How Little We Know and then complete as NCR."
fnv,3ca1cm,Redlightning1510,2,Mon Jul 6 21:10:04 2015 UTC,Were you planning on trying to go for the At a Loss For Words challenge by any chance?  I forgot to mention that seriously changes how you have to play the game.  In order to get 100 Speech Failures without affecting any quests you have to keep your level low and juggle quests in certain orders.

fnv,3c870u,DirkDiggy99,3,Sun Jul 5 21:54:53 2015 UTC,Jury Rigging helps anywhere and everywhere. Probably my favorite perk.

fnv,3c870u,Nameless_Archon,2,Mon Jul 6 04:23:18 2015 UTC,I can't imagine trying to sneak-kill the ghouls in Vault 34 with companions in tow.
fnv,3c870u,mynameisrodney,3,Mon Jul 6 10:11:21 2015 UTC,"You can't, really. The companions go aggressive almost immediately. Trying to keep them alive is a pain, because they will wander down dead end corridors and trigger rooms of ghouls that outnumber them, only to be mowed down. (Bonus points if they get to a gas-filled room before you do. They'll often kill five or six things, including themselves AND the player.)  ED-E is particularly bad about this, given his lower health/armor and damage output relative to Veronica or Boone and the way tight spaces impact his mobility.  Even as a stealth character, this is one of those moments where I've bought Shotgun Surgeon for a reason. You just go into ""tactical mode"" and shotgun (Combat Shotgun? The basic 12-gauge with added mods) them in the head or torso while clearing rooms at a breakneck pace, then double back for the loots.   Much more effective than trying to stealth it (speed = lower rads) and allows you to work with companion AI instead of against it. Can be done with a lever action 20 gauge, if you don't have the 75 skill needed for the 12 gauge, but be accurate. For the ""special room"" near the end The one with the overseer I usually bring a couple of grenades to clean up those damn turrets in order to prevent Boone from rushing in and trying to clean them up with a rifle at 2 feet of range.  This vault was nightmare fuel the first time, though - I was stealth spec'd and trying to play like it in this vault, which did not go well at all (thanks, Boone, you asshole, for charging into that last room before I could save).  On the plus side, this indicates how well stacking threats can still pose a challenge (or the sense of a challenge) in FNV. Vault 34 is like a small preview of Dead Money without needing the DLC..."

Honestly worked fine for me. My companion rarely turned agro until the ghouls were right on top of us, at which point it didn't matter that my cover was blown anyway. The rest of the time I just one-shotted them as soon as they came into view.   Yes it took longer than running through the vault with a shotgun. But honestly I doubt I used more than one or two stimpacks. Also I had much more fun this way.  EDIT: I have high perception, endurance and luck, high guns and sneak, and the better criticals, bloody mess and grim reaper's sprint perks. I'm pretty sure the turrets and overseer were the only things that couldn't be killed with a single headshot. Even then I just held back and kept looking around the corner, firing off a shot or two, and then going back to cover until the turrets stopped firing. My companion didn't enter the room.  EDIT 2: Even if you don't want to take your companion through the vault with you, I would still recommend bringing one along. There is a lot of loot in that armory. Just make them wait by the entrance, clear the vault, and then get them to follow you down afterwards."

I think it depends more on what you wear and what you're hit by (splash damage vs direct melee/ranged damage) because I wear bandanas and I haven't once had to repair it in my current 100+ hour playthrough, this also goes for glasses/shades. On the flip side I wear something like a Riot gear recon helmet and it ends up losing condition faster than my armor does. You should probably run a test on that theory while you play."

fnv,3c7qxn,Sigourn,10,Sun Jul 5 18:08:35 2015 UTC,"I wish someone had made a hi-res texture replacer for the bodies instead of creating new meshes.   You seem to forget that FNV is just the new FO3. Meshes and textures are the same. You only find Type 3 based body for FNV because it was the most used body shape for FO3. It mean that when FNV was released, modders already had a body shape, textures and clothes/armors conversions. So the only change where made according of this body. But if you search in the FO3 mods, you'll find some textures for the vanilla body. Like it's just a texture, there is no problem at all for to use it. And for the body, there is a lot of body replacers, not all this unrealistic. Search for Type N or Type V body, by example, they look shaped like a twentish girl next door. There is other more realistic body shape for FO3, but they weren't ported to FNV and you'll never find all the needed meshes for the clothes and armors. In the FO3 mods you can also find at least one attempt for a nude vanilla body. Not that the body must be nude, but it always bother me when a dead girl is more covered after I've looted her armor. Those magically appearing underwear aren't at all realistic.    This said, the problem for female models isn't that the body don't look like an average person, but that our mind don't have the capability to understand the size change. On a real girl, normal sized boobs look (relatively speaking) big, and the waist smaller than the hips. But when you need to reduce the size, suddenly the difference disappear. One centimeter become one pixel and you can't see any curve. They are realistically shaped, but don't look like a real girl.  So, yes, the body shape aren't realistic, but it's not because the guy that made it are a perverts, it's because it's the only way for them to keep looking womanly. Of course, some bodies are really made unrealistic, but the base bodies (Type 3 or Type 6 by example) don't look this exaggerated when you play them. Remember that the screen shoots or videos that you can see are made for to enhance the body (it's promotion after all), it's not a good representation of what it look like when you play. Even if you use sex mods you'll never be this close to a girl that you are in most of the screen shoots."

Ended up picking up the complete set during a Steam sale and I've spent hours with the game, but I've barely played it.  Most of the time I've played has been spent trying to perfect the look of the game, and a lot of that time was spent on body mods.  Loaded it up on XBox again today (DLCs were on sale) and realized that I don't even mind the default bodies that much, and it's so much nicer to not constantly go into Boone's inventory and see the ""erect"" and ""flaccid"" armour options.

DR is a flat decrease in the damage you take. If you have 15DR and take 100 damage, you'd receive 85 damage."

fnv,3c8d75,Question2005,7,Sun Jul 5 21:22:17 2015 UTC,"Give caps weight. It could be something minor - like 50 caps = 1 pound or something like that -- but it would keep you from easily hoarding tens of thousands of caps, or at least would force you to stash it in a safe somewhere. This would also add to the realism, because it's slightly ridiculous to imagine someone jamming 10,000 bottlecaps into the pockets of their leather duster or whatever.  Additionally or instead of that suggestion, include unique weapons at low, mid, and high level ranges throughout the game. I'm thinking of things like the Ratslayer gun, which is useful at lower levels. Of course the Ratslayer is something you just go and find for free, but what if there were similar unique items you could buy with a largeish number of caps? Or armors that give different types of effects.  You could also build item deterioration into the game, so that loot you pick up would lose its worth over time as it breaks down.  Just a few thoughts. I agree that the amount of money I generally wind up with by the end of the game is pretty ludicrous. (I would point out, though, that I remember in my first playthrough I was actually struggling for money. Once you figure out how to kind of min/max your looting and selling, the game becomes much more lucrative.)"

fnv,3c8d75,NukaCooler,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:13:15 2015 UTC,"Caps weight : This serves no purpose. For example lets say a player has 20k caps but can only carry 5k. So instead of one trip, he makes 4 trips. Does it make the game ""harder"" or give him more items to spend that money on? No. He still has the same amount of money to use.  More unique items : yes, but the problem is players wouldnt spend money on them if they can easily skip to the next tier. For example, nobody spends 750 caps to buy a 10mm extended magazine when they can easily save up and get a much better pistol instead...  Item deterioration : It will just force players to make more frequent trips to sell loot."

Chems/Stimpacks/Food are slightly more common, but still valuable to find.   These things wouldn't completely fix the issues with the games economy, but I feel would balance it better than vanilla."
fnv,3c8d75,Electric999999,2,Wed Jul 8 00:11:50 2015 UTC,"There are a few fixes that can easily be done. I agree that some things should be more expensive or at least not as highly available (e.g: weapon kits [should cost like 100-400 caps and more should be needed to fix something like a minigun] ).Also, there are other minor things that stand out as ridiculous. You shouldn't really be able to loot NCR soldiers after a battle while other NCR soldiers just stand around and let you dishonor their fallen buddies. The same thing goes for being able to freely loot people that other people kill. In this wasteland, I don't think anyone would just leave loot lying around... especially merchants.   However, overall I think the economy is just fine to represent what you the player are. You, the player, usually go through areas that almost anyone in New Vegas would die in. Thus, you're in a unique position full of plenty of loot and really expensive, previously well protected items."

I'm guessing one of my mods may be causing the problem, as I've not seen any other mention of this issue.  However it's just Project Nevada, WMX, Someguy's quest mods, and a couple home mods... nothing unusual and nothing specific to Dead Money, and nothing that has shown any glitches until this specific (extremely game-breaking) one."

fnv,3c57pi,abHowitzer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:19:31 2015 UTC,"I have tried the setstage and completequest, along with movetoqt (which just teleports to a hallway midway along the long route for some reason).  Also tried noclipping around, but as far as I can tell the elevator is the only exit to the map and without being able to activate it there's just no way out.  Unless there's a command to warp to a different map that I haven't found.  I was hoping someone else had run into this but it doesn't seem likely.  Since I pretty much completed the entire thing with the exception of that very last step of going up the elevator (and since the nothing in the remaining DLC or the main game changes regardless of how you do in Dead Money or even if you do it), I'm probably just going to load a save from before starting the DLC and consider it done.  I can just use the console to mark the quest as done and maybe summon in the holorifle for completion/collection sake.

It's available as soon as you first step outside at the start of the game. You can select everything you want completed and receive credit for it, then once you find the bunker, choose ""complete the DLC"" or whatever, and it will tell you to start the DLC. It automatically goes to the best possible ending.  I believe if you don't choose the ""complete the DLC"" option, you can play through it as usual.   The only problem is that Elijah's Ramblings are automatically applied to you (you can't give them to Veronica), and since you never had a chance to play in the casino, you don't get the usual allowance every three days in the bunker."

Secondly, by handing Zion Park over to the White legs he hands them a very nice base of operations from which they will probably raid many Caravans.  Many would die, possibly more than the numbers of the Sorrows. Daniel would buy their ""Innocence"" with so much Blood they might drown in it.  And it isn't save there either. The White Legs might not be able to follow them but others might. Anyone wanting to have the Grand Staircase, which is apparently easy to defend. Some might be tempted to see just how easy it is to defend against attackers with an edge in Technology, which is rather easy to get over the Sorrows.  Also, is there no one living in the Grand Staircase? Would be funny if the Sorrows became the white legs to some other, innocent tribe...  Joshua sees the White Legs as a Threat to everyone, not just the Zion Tribals. He sees Zion as a Temple of God needing to be cleansed where as i would kick the White Legs out to prevent them from harassing Caravans, possibly some seeking to trade with the denizens of Grand Staircase.  Furthermore, it would be good if Word where to spread that there's someone living in Zion who's generally friendly but able and willing to defend themselves."

My mercy is vast, but not inexhaustible. The White-Legs would be peaceful and share with the Sorrows, or they would be pacified. There would be no half measures. They would not comply, and their actions spoke their dissent, so I accepted their terms: No quarter asked, none given. They shot first, but I would shoot last.  The White-Legs sought to waken fear but found to their dismay that fear arose hungry. Many of their number fed me, but still I hungered. Eventually, I took my hunger to the feast they would not refuse me, and I supped upon their numbers one atop the next, the piquant tang of their fear heavy in the air and mixed with the metallic smells of blood and the haze of gunsmoke, the calls of the wounded and the gasps of the meals in the act of becoming.  Their leader fed me, in the end. Peace at last, enforced by a cannibal more terrifying than an entire tribe."

fnv,3c60qz,Sentuh,3,Sun Jul 5 15:26:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't really understand what Salt-upon-wounds was about. He is portrayed as a ruthless asshole but then he's cowering in fear when i see him. I don't think i've been hearing falsified news, i reckon he did kill many people in rather disagreeable ways but when faced with a quick death he cowers anyways? Well, i reckon Joshua wouldn't torture him to death but rather give him one bullet to the back of the head, comparatively humane.  Which would be perfectly reasonable in my Mind; i reckon he'd gather remaining people and attack some caravan tomorrow, for which i'd feel partly responsible if i didn't take out the Spring that powers the murder engine that is the White legs.  You don't kill him because of Revenge, you kill him so that he can't kill anyone else, which he would do if given the chance. But the Narration says that he loses his fighting spirit or whatever and his tribe gets overtaken and scattered or something. Did he wear his Helmet to hide his massive emo fringe or something?  I don't think that he goes home and sulks until other tribes scatter his. If he went home and attacked one caravan, even a tiny caravan like maybe the one you came to Zion with, it would be perfectly reasonable to kill him to prevent that from happening.  But Obsidian thinks differently and says that Salt-upon-wounds flees and the tribe is scattered. Whoever lost their lives in that process isn't important. Well, if Murderers kill each other i won't be too shaken up about it but i reckon some Caravans will suffer for it.  But Obsidian tells me that this is the bad option and this is the good option so i spared old Salty. Not because it was what i wanted to do or because i thought it made Sense but because it is the ""good"" option by decree of Obsidian.  Why would killing Salt-upon-wounds influence the Sorrows so negatively? I dunno. I could've just told them that i killed him to prevent him from killing. But apparently i did that already so there would be no need to kill him because now he's so very scared that he'll never fight again or something? Whatever.

I shot him myself.   Daniel clearly was misguided when he thought that moving another 100km to the next plateau would actually accomplish anything. The white-legs would simply follow them as their admittance to the Legion requires their exterminating the people from Zion/Sorrows.

As soon as that dialogue ended, I made a beeline for the door, slamming on the use button to open the door, while sneaking. I went up the left-hand of the center staircases, still crouching. I then went through the hallway, around the bend to the right, and only finally stood up once behind the solid wall so Elijah couldn't see me. I made it through the final door well before the force-field went off, and reached the elevator no problem.  I googled for a map to illustrate what I did, and this is the best one I found: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2RXFPvqzZM8/T5U5P95xP7I/AAAAAAAAAAA/6WojZ3iGPkI/s1600/escapewith37sierramadre.jpg  I see some of the other posters mentioned that they dropped the bricks by the door to gain some speed, but I was able to do it without ever dropping the bricks, so if you do, that should only give you extra buffer time to make it :)  Also, for what it's worth, I had 100 sneak by this time, so I was quite difficult to detect.

I kept having happen what you are describing, and I figured out what caused it: you are going over there TOO fast. If you get up there as fast as you are describing (and as fast as I was at first), and try to round the corner to go through the final door, Elijah will see you, and that is why the force field is getting thrown up. I thought it was because I was going too slow at first, but it turns out it was the exact opposite.  Wait for him to go down the stairs and towards the vault before you round the corner and go through the final force field door. Otherwise he sees you and IMMEDIATELY throws up the force field."

Low sneak, no Stealth Boy, Sierra Madre Armor. Maybe I'll make a video of it. I do it like this:   Pick up all the stuff you want from the vault. No need to drop the bars. Just grab all the things. Saving is a good idea. Go to the monitor. Convince Elijah to come talk to you. There's more than one way to achieve that, I usually take the speech path. You know you got it right when he says, ""I'm coming down"". Immediately turn around and walk to the door as fast as you can (but still slowly because of the encumberance). Open the door. Right outside the 'dome' of the Vault, to your left, there is a short pillar with electric looking stuff jutting out of the top. Crouch behind it. At this point Elijah shows up. Save. He'll go around the pillar to the vault. The key here is to not let him make visual contact with you. Move aroynd the pillar as he makes his way to the Vault door. SAVE AGAIN NOW. This is the tricky part. As he is reaching the computer, get up and leave. Wait too long and the field will go up. Wait too much and the field will go up. The sweet spot is when he's about two steps from the computer. Watch as the force field goes up behind you. Listen to old Elijah say ""What! Alarms?... You. Think you can run? Blah blah blah"" Laugh a soft, cruel laughter. Wait as a pair of pixelated sunglasses drops swiftly to your eyes and the CSI Miami theme starts playing.   YEEEEEEAAAAAAAH!!!!!"

Talking to your companions reveals that  you got there because God/Dog essentially obeyed Elijah's every word, you'll find out what the Fog is in another DLC, and same with the Ghost People.   The storyline definitely focuses more on the people involved in the casino than the casino itself, so ignoring the people and the terminals they leave behind lets you ignore a large part of the story.  That being said, yes, gameplay-wise it's very different from the rest of the DLCs. The mechanics are what made it difficult (although I enjoyed it), but the enemies are harder in Old World Blues, in my opinion.  Dead Money was my favorite DLC, but I did honestly enjoy the others.

Believe me when I say I didn't enjoy the beginning because it feels downright unfair at times like not knowing exactly where the fucking radio is at, or being able to sleep anywhere but the police station, or being able to fast travel. But that's what made this DLC unique, it's very survival horror and I found myself being genuinely creeped out many times and had me worrying when I had to scrounge for Cloud Residue in order to get Ghost Sight which had me forcing myself to use it anytime I was outside. This DLC is the best DLC if you're going for a hardcore run.  I for one liked it for its story and its characters. That and Light Step makes this DLC a breeze as well as having high stealth if you don't like confronting the Ghost People. And having a high repair keeps weapons in good condition since you don't get many in the first hour or so. Different folks, different strokes, you either hate it or you like it. I highly recommend Old World Blues if you haven't done that yet, easily my favorite of the 4."
fnv,3c5g69,Anmar7779,12,Sun Jul 5 05:09:17 2015 UTC,I cannot put into words how much I disagree with you
fnv,3c5g69,Th3ShitRebellion,4,Sun Jul 5 00:43:16 2015 UTC,It's a shitty linear and boring DLC over all. However the lore surrounding it is fantastic including the characters. If you are going to play dead money play it for the lore and not for the gameplay.
fnv,3c5g69,Question2005,3,Sun Jul 5 06:01:05 2015 UTC,"I didnt find dead money fun at all. The ghost people werent a challenge and the speakers (which often you couldnt see) were REALLY annoying.  I also couldnt get dean to co-operate with me no matter how nice i was to him, because i would always get railroaded into a hostile ending in the thearter.  I didnt find it fun to dodge the holograms either.  The ghost people werent challenging at all, just annoying.  The worst thing is that the DLC doesnt offer any noticeable things you can bring back to the wasteland. HH had unique equipment, OWB had implants, perks and equipment, LR has unique equipment. The only unique things DM have to offer is a busted holorifle that can only be repaired by weapon kits and the vouchers that are mainly useful for buying weapon kits.  The money you get from the vault is completely unnecessary...it is VERY easy to hit 50k+ leftover caps just by selling loot and not touching any of the casinos.  The perk you can get from elijah's holotape doesnt even work for veronica since its for her melee skill and if you take the tape for yourself (for some reason you cant give it to veronica afterwards...) it doesnt do anything unless you are a melee character."
fnv,3c5g69,Electric999999,2,Sun Jul 5 07:01:28 2015 UTC,"There's a really easy barter check when you meet dean, he doesn't like it if you use it."
fnv,3c5g69,Fugdish,2,Mon Jul 6 09:16:00 2015 UTC,Force yourself to be interested and immersed in the story and what's going on. Don't just look for excuses to get annoyed with everything in Dead Money; then you will enjoy it.
fnv,3c430e,razorsedge1996,4,Sat Jul 4 16:05:52 2015 UTC,"I did a disgruntled NCR grunt who learned how to love the Mojave. Started off with high strength and endurance, something about how motivated she was to fix the Wasteland and slaughter the Legion. I made her story about how she was leading a heavy weapons squad to help a camp when the squad was ambushed and almost destroyed. Ashamed of her mistakes, she wandered the Mojave as a Courier until Benny popped a cap in her dome.   Basically, I took Cowboy, Grunt, Heavy Handed, Heave Ho!, and Kamakize. Went around blowing anything Legion to bits, then running in with melee to butcher survivors. That old NCR squad will be avenged, one Legion soldier and corrupt NCR officer at a time. Chances Knife was a nice weapon, enjoying both Cowboy and Grunt bonuses, and fit her background. Later game, she 'discovered' more Mojave weapons like the trail carbine and hunting shotguns from the kind Great Kahns. While tripping on Mentats, she learned of their past. Enraged, she sneak-killed too many NCR officers to count while partying with the grunts and teaching them new skills so they might survive their deployment. Not even Mr. House's twisted version of the world could appeal to her. Not that it matters since he took a BB gun to the face."
fnv,3c430e,Darth_Cosmonaut_1917,2,Sat Jul 4 17:44:28 2015 UTC,"Probably not the most creative thing, but my character right now is a descendant of The Chosen One (via the child he had with Angela Bishop), which means she traces her lineage back to the Vault Dweller from Vault 13. A native of the NCR, she's well aware of the importance of The Vault Dweller in the success of Shady Sands and the founding of the NCR. She views the NCR, similar to New Arroyo, as an ancestral home that she wants to see flourish.   She's basically generation 3 of my typical Fallout character, high Charisma, High intelligence, emphasis on Speech, Science, and Energy weapons, and a general ""fosterer of civilization""."
fnv,3c430e,JakalDX,2,Sun Jul 5 09:25:11 2015 UTC,"My current playthrough is a NCR wash-out. Born in Shady Sands and a career militaryman, he tried to make it as a NCR Ranger but didn't make the cut, due to failing the hand-to-hand combat test and ""teamplay issues"". Angry, he dropped out of the army and began working as a courier - it was a dangerous job, but he weathered danger well, plus it enabled him to work alone.  Life was fine until he accepted a strange job delivering a platinum chip, and the rest is history. Even though he's working on his issues (getting shot in the head and being left to die can make you rethink some things), he still does odd jobs for the Republic.  Other than that, he's a smoker and prefers lever-action weaponry. His favorite hobbies are crafting, killing lowlifes and gardening. He enjoys long walks in the desert, the smells of blood and gunpowder, bighorner steak and playing blackjack."

IWS (Increased Wasteland Spawn) & Eve if you think your computer can handle it. These are my personal favorites, but I'm more of the 'hardcore' type of gamer who prefers challenge over most everything else. I mostly follow the STEP guide for NV and most of the link to the mods are there, but in your situation I'd probably just install those I mentioned.  http://wiki.step-project.com/User:EssArrBee/FalloutNewVegas#New_Vegas_Uncut  Still there are plenty of other great mods feature there. I'd just lay off the texture and weather mods (graphic mods), and focus only on the mods that add content or improve existing content. Guide teaches you how to clean files using FNVEdit (really fucking easy) and merging files using FNVEdit (also really fucking easy). It can take a bit of work to mod a game, but it's good to be patient and learn the steps well. The end experience will be great. I like helping people install mods; If you have any questions feel free to drop a PM."

During this year I've played it for about 150 hours and completed it twice. The sheer amount of variation each playthrough is astounding. You can't really notice it the first time you play it.

fnv,3by04y,sohunterish,17,Fri Jul 3 02:20:58 2015 UTC,"Here. This is valid though. I wrote this guide to help people on reddit. It shows how much the community makes Reddit. This is one of the points of this silent protest. Without the content we have and create, Reddit is nothing. The moderators do a ton of work and what they did by not telling the IAMA mods about their main go between from the mods to the artists, authors, actors, and various other people doing AMAs, this stops us in our tracks. All they had to do was let them know and forward contact info and this would have gone so much smoother.   We are standing with them for that reason.   Regardless, here is my guide.   THIS IS THE DISCUSSION POST FOR  THIS GUIDE. PLEASE CLICK HERE IF YOU NEED HELP AFTER READING THE GUIDE  Fixes for all fallout games listed below. Please read everything for your game  For all games, Ensure you have your Audio and Video drivers up to date!  before asking for help, make sure your computer meets minimum requirements   If you find any errors in the guide, due to links being changed, or things no longer being available (like games for windows live) Please tell me in our current discussion post  Fallout 1  Some people will have a ""Rainbow"" effect on videos and certain parts of the game. There are three options here for Vista , Windows 7, 8(.1), and 10   Option 1  (backup files before editing them) Find ddraw.ini in your Fallout Folder, Under [Graphics] find the Mode=0 and change it to 4 for full screen and 5 for windowed.  Option 2  Right click on the falloutw.exe in your game directory. Go to compatibility. Run it for XP compatibility, in 256 Colors, and in 640x480 resolution.  Option 3 (best option)  You can also get the unofficial patch for the game from here:  Link  allowing you to install the High Resolution Patch here  Link  Fallout 2  A lot of F2 not starting is due to a need to be ran in administrator mode. Right click the game, click on properties, click on compatibility, and select ""run as administrator"" this includes most instances of ""Fallout2.exe cannot be started""  People often have an issue in fallout 2 similar to Fallout 1 with graphical errors and the obvious hindrance of low resolution or any amount of bugs.   The best bet is Killaps Fallout 2 Restoration Project.Many years in the making, It fixes over a thousand bugs, adds some minor content, adds high resolution, and includes Killaps unofficial patch that I had linked before. It should solve most issues you may have with fallout 2. (Note, Fallout 2 cannot be in Program Files for this to work, install it elsewhere first, or move it to the desktop for install)  Killaps Fallout 2 Restoration Project  If you do not want to use the restoration project (I suggest you do), you can try the following  Go to:  steam/steamapps/common/fallout 2 Folder and find ddraw.ini file, Open with notepad. Find ""Graphics"", look 4 lines down and find ""mode=0"" change this to ""mode=4"",   Look Further down and find ""graphics height"" and ""graphics width"" This is your resolution, change the values to the resolution you want, up to 1920x1080  Fallout 3  Fallout 3 works better with older hardware and older OS, in this case ""the newer the better"" is not fully true.  Run the game launcher and the game executable in your game folder as an admin. (right click the files, go to properties, go to compatibility, select ""run as administrator"")  Windows 7 , 8(.1) , 10 + Multicore Fix  First and foremost, The game runs on Windows 7 , 8(.1) and 10, it is just ""not optimized"" for it. A company is not going to add compatibility for a new OS after release because its a giant headache for them.  This is the multicore fix and is one of the most important things. You should do this for Fallout 3 and New Vegas if you have a quadcore processor (or any processor with more than 2 cores). The Gamebyro engine (which runs fallout 3 and NV) has issues with 2 or more cores. This fix forces the game to run on two cores. It will fix a LARGE majority of crashing for most people.   Go to /Documents/My games/Fallout 3/ Find fallout.ini Open with notepad Use find (Ctrl F) and type ""bUseThreadedAI=0"" without quotes Replace ""bUseThreadedAI=0 "" with ""bUseThreadedAI=1"" Add an extra line and type ""iNumHWThreads=2""   *If you STILL have a lot  of crashes you can reduce that number to 1 but it will effect game performance. *  Do not confuse fallout.ini in /my games/Fallout 3/ with the fallout_default.ini in your fallout game folder, DO NOT edit fallout_default.ini)   the INI file can be overwritten if you use the normal fallout launcher. You can stop this if the launcher does not run as an administrator, and you set the ini to read only by right clicking the ini file, pressing properties, and clicking ""read only"". A better way is to launch your game using a mod manager, such as Nexus Mod  Manager, regardless of if you use mods or not  .net runtime files  The runtime files that come with the CD version of Fallout 3 may not work correctly, you should download the current ones from Microsoft.  Fallout comes with 3.5 that you can get here  You can also update to version 4 here  Large Address Aware / Ram Usage  If you run a lot of mods, Fallout will crash due to high memory usage. This program will set a flag allowing the game to use more than 4GB of ram. It can be downloaded here  Link  Performance  If you have performance issues, you can get mods that will reduce the amount of unused clutter in the game. This is an example of such a mod  Link  Games for Windows Live  More recently known as Games for Windows Marketplace, [Now gone completely, but still downloadable] Can cause issues in fallout 3 across all versions of Windows. Windows 8 users need to update games for Windows live before using this mod   update here :  Games for Windows Live  You can then disable it via this mod You don't need to disable it unless you have exhausted all other fixes, otherwise leave it alone! :   Disabler Link  Fake Fullscreen  Running in a full window is an option. This is a mod that allows the game to run in ""fake fullscreen"" which can stop issues from instant crashes and using Alt-Tab  Fake Fullscreen  ""The ordinal 42 could not be located "" fix  If you get the error ""The ordinal 42 could not be located in the dynamic link library C:\windows\SYSTEM32\xlive.dll."" You need to get games for windows live, as I linked above. You may also need to disable it after, but it DOES need to be installed first.  Games for Windows Live  Crash on ""New Game"" - d3d9.dll fix - Intel Fix -  If you crash on clicking new game you likely have onboard Intel graphics card (This can also work for non Intel cards, it's a very common issue) you can use this fix, which tricks the game to thinking you have a different video card. (Windows Vista, 7 , 8 , 10, confirmed) (This fix overrides fallout.ini and includes the multicore fix)  Intel Fix  Stutter Issues  Fallout 3 Stutter Remover mod can help many people who have issues with stuttering. It requires the FOSE. You can download the mod here  Stutter remover  Fallout 3 Audio Errors  Codecs should only be used for a specific issue. If you have done the multicore fix and Fallout 3 still freezes in the opening scene giving birth, you can try using klite (You no not need to try this fix unless you freeze in the FO3 birth scene AND are using the multicore fix, or you have exhausted all other options)  Codec Link  The most common thing I see is music not working, and funny enough it is often because the music levels have been turned down in the options menu. Make sure your volumes are up in the settings in game.  After that you can try using the codec above (Linked right here  If this does not work, and you are in windows Vista or 7, launch the game and open the game console. Type ""snd_legacy_surround 1"" without quotes.  You need to ensure your audio drivers are up to date as well. Here is a list of audio driver companies.  Audiotrak USA  Creative Technology  Hercules/Guillemot  M-Audio  Philips Electronics   Realtek  Terratec Promedia  Turtle Beach  Prebuilt Systems may need drivers from the manufacturer:  Acer America  Alienware  Compaq  Dell  eMachines  Gateway  Hewlett Packard (HP)  IBM Corp.

It is part of several codec packs that stop Klite from running. Check Add/Remove Programs (Programs and features on Windows 7 and 8) area of your control panel, if not you can disable it as so:  1.Find the ffdshow video decoder configuration window in the start menu. If you have other Codec packs, it will be under its submenu (like CCCP or Vista Codecs) (You may also be able to use the ""Run"" button on the start menu by typing  'C:\WINDOWS\system32\rundll32.exe ffdshow.ax,configureAudio' or  C:\Windows\SysWOW64\rundll32.exe ffdshow.ax,configureAudio'   2.Tick the Don't use ffdshow checkbox  3.Press the edit.

First and foremost, the Multicore fix.

It affects less people in NV, but does still happen)   Go to /Documents/My games/Fallout New Vegas/ Find fallout.ini Open with notepad Use find (Ctrl F) and type ""bUseThreadedAI=0"" without quotes Replace ""bUseThreadedAI=0 "" with ""bUseThreadedAI=1"" Add an extra line and type ""iNumHWThreads=2""   *If you STILL have a lot  of crashes you can reduce that number to 1 but it will effect game performance. *  Do not confuse fallout.ini in /my games/Fallout New Vegas/ with the fallout_default.ini in your fallout game folder, DO NOT edit fallout_default.ini)  the INI file can be overwritten if you use the normal fallout launcher. You can stop this if the launcher does not run as an administrator, and you set the ini to read only by right clicking the ini file, pressing properties, and clicking ""read only"". A better way is to launch your game using a mod manager, such as Nexus Mod  Manager, regardless of if you use mods or not  Fallout 4GB - Ram Usage  Fallout 4GB - If using a lot of mods, ram usage will go up. This is similar to FO3 Large Address aware. Even if your game is not reaching 4GB of ram, this patch can fix crashes.  Fallout 4GB  This is a performance mod that gets rid of a lot of useless clutter in the wasteland for people with performance issues.  Crashing on New Game   You can attempt the d3d9 fix for New Vegas, located here for Nvidia or here for ATI / AMD . As a note, the Nvidia one will work for both, but the 2nd may lead to better performance for ATI users.  Run the game in Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode If you have the program ""Creative Alchemy"" disable it from effecting New Vegas   Crashing on New Game with  Lenovo laptops   Uninstall Lenovo OneKey Theater Run the game with XP SP3 compatibility mode ( right click the exe, go to proprieties, go to compatibility, and select Windows XP Service Pack 3)   Performance Issues  Performance of the Gods  New Vegas Stutter Remover is a mod that can help with random stuttering in the game. It Requires NVSE.  Stutter Remover  Continuously Loading  If yoursave will not load and the roulette wheel keeps spinning on the loading screen, this is an easy fix. Simply load a save that IS working (or press new game) Once in this save or new game, try loading the one that was earlier stuck on the load screen. It will now work. (It is best to load rather than use new game, for the sake of preserving auto-saves)  Missing music / radio  If you are missing music or radio, you may have a codec installed called LAV. It may be an old version which needs to be updated. You can update it by clicking here  NV / 3 UAC Windows Vista and 7  It is suggested that people instal steam outside of Program Files. The main reason is UAC in Windows Vista and less so in 7 causing some issues with writing files in protected locations. If you install steam to another location such as  C:\steam you can fix issues across a lot of different games involving User Account Control.  Minimum Requirements  This website can tell you if you meet the requirements for FO3 and FNV. It is not a 100%. Some people can run the game if you barely fail the requirements, but be warned, if you buy the game and do no meet the requirements, it is your own fault.  http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri"

The admins made a decision that will ultimately affect all of reddit, whether it concerns you and I specifically or not.  If you read the link to /r/OutOfTheLoop this change is leaning towards the further monetization of reddit and it's users as a whole. More importantly it's created a greater divide between the Admins and the Mods of subreddits. The Admins didn't even think twice about how this decision would affect the mods of certain subreddits.  Now don't get me wrong, some change is okay. But I really don't want Reddit to become Facebook 2.0.   It's an inconvenience, but it's also temporary. If you go to /r/Fallout this can be seen at the bottom of the page (emphasis mine):   Due to the way Reddit has handled recent changes in administration, /r/fallout has decided to join a group of subreddits going dark temporarily. We apologize to those wishing to post.  Please stand by.    The change affects subreddits that I don't often visit, but the blackout is ultimately protecting the subreddits I do visit often. So I am willing to accept a temporary inconvenience to do that. I am not thrilled about it, but I am willing to accept it. Mostly because although this current change doesn't affect most of my  subreddits, in the future it could easily affect them."

fnv,3by04y,86hawkeye,0,Fri Jul 3 13:51:41 2015 UTC,"The mods still need to recognize that overall those subreddits are community subreddit not there personal playground and they should at least acknowledge that not everyone here may have wished to see them go dark regardless of what the moderators feel about the subject. There were plenty of solutions to this seen on other subreddits such as shutting down the ability to post new threads, voting, etc. The mod(s) (really outta remember a single mod may have done this) choose to implement his thoughts over the others who use it.

fnv,3by04y,Geason,2,Fri Jul 3 02:36:47 2015 UTC,"Might I just say very few people are pissed over Victoria herself losing the job, but rather the fact that the mods of the AMA subreddit only found out after someone went to meet her and she didn't attend having been fired. The complaint is that the admins could have fired off a warning message to the mods without any difficulties (even if the warning was just ""due to some ongoing issues we are unwilling to discuss Victoria won't be performing her normal duties until further notice"" or similar) and at the very least reddit should have cancelled the meetings Victoria had scheduled, instead of having people confused when she doesn't attend.

fnv,3by04y,JDGumby,4,Fri Jul 3 02:49:20 2015 UTC,Seems the administrators of /r/fallout (who seem to control a fair few fallout subreddits) decided to protest a reddit staffing change. Seems the fact this affects more then just them didn't bother them. (I'm surprised this one didn't go dark).
fnv,3by04y,Zathas,4,Fri Jul 3 03:12:18 2015 UTC,"Mods, not Admins.   This wasn't about not effecting the community. The protest covers a lot of aspects, but to be personally it is how they treated the response to the moderators of the subreddits that the fired staff member was involved with.   She was an extremely important part of AMAs. Without her many would never happen. After she was let go with no notice to anyone, IAMA had a huge problem. They had AMAs lined up and zero contact information. All these people waiting to do AMAs and no one talking to them. No way to contact artists, musicians, agents, etc. There was even an author who had flown to New York to do an AMA, which was also cancelled.   The fact that AMAs were scheduled , yet the only person with the information to make those go smoothly was fired, without passing any of that information on, is the main issue. The mods simply needed to know so they could make Reddit function, especially when IAMA is such an integral part of Reddit.   We don't feel they should talk to the community about internal staffing, thats is not our business, nor do we care the reason for the dismissal. What most people care about is not being treated like we don't have an effect on the community. Again, telling the mods and passing on that info would have saved all of this.   The community makes Reddit. The moderators of those communities work extremely hard to help those function. Sometimes with the CSS work, design, organizing the fallout network, and times like Fallout 4s announcement, we can put in as much time moderating as we do on our full time jobs. Many mods of many subs do this much work.   All we ask is the Admins realize that Reddit isn't just about them, it is about all of us. The community, the users, the moderators, and the admins themselves.   So as much as you said we did this because we didn't consider other people it effects...thats the ONLY thing we thought of, and we are standing alongside dozens of major subreddits and tens of thousands of users voicing their opinion."

fnv,3by04y,Mist_Rising,0,Fri Jul 3 15:45:28 2015 UTC,"What do you expect us to do, ask on the subreddit? Furthermore, do you have any evidence to the contrary?  Regardless, the shutting down of subreddits appears to have HELPED  reddit more then harmed it. The people who use those subreddits can't read them currently but as seen by the /u/Cyrus224 post here, reddit is still getting money from this subreddit while they protest.   I'm not sure if the subreddits even acknowledged there community (They started going dark while I was making and eating dinner) but when I looked at fallout before it went dark I saw NO posts asking if the community wanted to join. Instead the Mods seem to have decided on there own if it was fine - they had no more indication then JD that the majority agreed...but I notice that most other gaming subreddits when given the chance have voted NOT to go dark.   Perhaps something to be said about our moderators remembering they are not the community and giving us a chance to speak before committing to such actions?"
fnv,3by04y,Zathas,2,Fri Jul 3 17:23:57 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, do you have any evidence to the contrary?   I can't say I do. But that's the thing, I'm not the one here claiming I'm in the ""majority"".  I'm pretty sure at least the Fallout 4 sub had a topic about the matter, though I'm not sure about the main Fallout one. It seems that the subs that have chosen to keep out of this are usually small ones. Can't say whether that's a factor or not.  And I know that the whole ""reddit is still getting money from this subreddit while they protest."" is nonsense. Active users have barely gone up anywhere since the incident. Especially here. People not posting in those subs is making a difference. Whether or not it's taken into consideration by the admins is another thing altogether."

However Due to the war just starting, they never manged to get the chip to his place. So he manged to protect against most atomic bombs trying to strike Nevada - Las Vegas but he manged to protect a majority of the bombs but a few bombs slipped past his defensive system due to the software not being able to process fast enough.

He programmed multiple mainframes with satellite links meant to disable the vast majority of the Chinese missiles while in flight, then designed an array of high powered laser cannons, which he had installed on the roof of the Lucky 38, to deal with any missile his program had missed.

While legion in charge is not an option, you want NCR gone just slightly less than you want legion gone.  Quest wise, if you side with Mr. House or Yes-man, it only prevents you from doing NCR main quest, which leads to the NCR ending - obviously mutually exclusive with House/Yes-man. You are still allowed to do NCR side-quests, since they won't attack you on sight.  Legion is actually smarter that they see you as a threat if you side with any other faction and will try to kill you on sight, so either do their sidequests before you pick a faction, or only do their sidequests on a legion playthrough.

To boost damage even higher: Grunt perk adds 25% damage, and with Hand Loader perk you can craft 5.56mm match ammo - 1,15x damage, 0.65x spread. With WMX you can mod it, one of the mods increases damage.  Oh, and the gun is not from a mod, it's in the base game.  *edit: forgot to mention, All-American might be a bit hard to get, but from your post it looks like you want a challenge, so that's probably a good thing :) Location spoiler: it's in Vault 34."

This seems like a good team to throw in with. He never even tries to lie or explain how you'll be treated SOOOO much differently from everyone else.

fnv,3brbp4,wastelandr0mance,32,Fri Jul 3 03:58:52 2015 UTC,"There's a couple of things to consider. If it was a straight up fight with ncr against legion, considering the legion doesn't use shields, med-x, other chems etc, on paper the ncr, rangers, and possibly House's secruritrons would win (gun/laser to a kinfe fight). Compared to all the other factions, the ncr and legion boast the largest numbers, but the ncr has more firearms than the legion. Assuming also that their greatest asset, Lanius, would be chilling out in his tent, it would just be a turkey shoot on the surface walls. We also have to consider that the legion is the attacking party, and is no stranger to dirty bombing (searchlight), the ncr would have much more to lose since as defenders they have to hold their position at the dam. Yet, it would appear that the ncr has their artillery at the dam in working condition, the ncr also has vertibirds and power armor (though salvaged). Again, I'm assuming that both sides would bring first their massive but weaker bulk of lower rung troops to the front first, meaning the spear chucking recruits would be decimated by service rifle recruits, then the mix of decanus and praetorians that would assault the dam past the middle shack would them be lured into the easy kills of the ncr recruits since they have way more dt than legion recruits, only to then be picked apart by .50 mg anti materials. Lanius would then appear and rally a final charge, during which time the ncr could just rig the middle tower posts with explosives so to halt the legion final assault, and meanwhile they could use vertibirds to cut off reinforcements from flagstaff, and wait out the attrition while they fight inside the walls. This is just the open battle situation, I'm hard pressed to say that Caesar values the dam as a power source way to much to destroy it. EDIT: I forgot to bring up the fact that somehow the boomer's carpetbombing the legion's/ncr's side of the shack doesn't leave a scratch on the dam, when it should."

The examples so far agree that NCR would rout the Legion, and I believe they would too - Your average NCR Trooper is armed with body armour and a Service Rifle, whereas the Legion come in with handguns and spears, dressed in football pads. Not only that, the NCR is entrenched on Hoover as it is - they have positional and technological superiority. The Legion's numbers and lack of morals would take them far, but not far enough to win, and the Bear would bring down the Bull on the top of the Dam.  However, the NCR would take serious losses during this battle, to the extent that their influence in the Mojave would diminish almost entirely - Don't forget that the NCR are overextending themselves even by being in the Mojave in the first place. I expect President Kimball would have to call off all NCR operations in the Mojave for decades after the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, and return the surviving troopers and rangers to the rest of California.  So, the Legion are scattered and ruined, the Mojave NCR are a spent force, and none of the other factions - the Boomers, the Followers of the Apocalypse, the Mojave Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel - are willing or able to make a power play - Mr. House can retrieve the Platinum Chip, upgrade his Securitrons, and take over The Strip uncontested.

House is playing on his home turf, so reinforcing these weak positions with securitrons wouldn't be too much of a logistical challenge, leaving him with the winning hand, provided he manages to activate the weather station's vault. The Legion during this time would have a narrow opportunity to further colonize or pillage the banks of the Colorado and the nearby settlements during the chaos, providing they are cut off from the Fort during the battle"

fnv,3brbp4,Pallas,5,Wed Jul 1 15:51:50 2015 UTC,"My guess: The NCR barely wins, but is effectively crippled in the New Vegas area, and the Dam is probably damaged in the process, if not destroyed.  The Legion: Highly motivated, well-trained, well-led, and well-organized. Against a rabble of similarly melee-armed tribesmen like the ones in Honest Hearts, the Legion is fantastic. In a long-term war of attrition against the NCR, again, the Legion will be great. If I were Caesar or his next-of-kin, I would keep on grinding the NCR down with raids like the ones on Nipton and Camp Searchlight. The NCR lacks the morale and staying power to hold down New Vegas indefinitely, and attacking camps and supply centers in NCR territory would make occupying the Dam impractical.  The NCR: Already weakened, with an army mostly consisting of poorly trained conscripts. That said, the NCR has a clear advantage in firepower and supplies, with all the remaining industry of the West Coast behind them, along with plenty of manpower. The Legion is mostly armed with melee weapons and short-ranged firearms, while just about every NCR trooper is armed with an assault rifle, along with the occasional elite sniper. In addition, the NCR has spent years digging into the Dam with significant defensive structures.  So, if it comes down to a final battle without the Courier's intervention, my money is on the NCR, although barely. An all-out assault of melee-armed troops on a heavily entrenched army of heavily armed soldiers would just be a replay of World War 1 at first. The Legion troops would just march in lockstep right into sniper and machine-gun fire. Initial waves would drain ammunition and fatigue NCR troops. The fanatical morale of Legion troops would allow their commanders to continue throwing them into the meat grinder against the NCR. Initial lines of defense would fall, albeit with heavy casualties, to the Legion. Boulder City, already being destroyed, wouldn't be available to booby trap. That means that NCR would likely have to booby trap their defenses on the Dam itself, or risk being overrun completely. Eventually the Legion assault would be stopped by a combination of booby traps and the NCR's advantage in long-range firepower. No amount of morale can make up for the fact that the Legion has swords and the NCR sniper rifles and high explosives.   That said, a lot of NCR troops, being conscripts, would either die or be routed from the Dam, leaving the NCR weakened in the region. Laying traps all over the Dam, a necessary evil, would also damage it, hampering its power generating ability, maybe permanently with few trained engineers available to fix it. The Legion would have to retreat completely from the area, weakened by the assault and left with a non-functioning dam as the only reward. The NCR would likely try to stay and get the dam up and running again as well as continue to attempt to assert its power over the Strip's citizens. Very severe problems for the Republic (revolution/civil war) would be likely in the near future.  tl;dr: The Legion would barely lose, the Dam would be severely damaged, and the NCR would be weakened very badly."
fnv,3brbp4,ChewiestBroom,3,Wed Jul 1 16:30:06 2015 UTC,"I think Caeser's Legion wins the dam in a much easier fashion than you think. Sure the NCR has guns and the defensive advantage, but you're forgetting how tight the fighting space is. The top of the dam is only sectioned off with sandbags, no barbed wire or anything to slow down the advance. The legion can easily move up the dam overtaking the NCR in the tight quarters. The green recruits of the NCR only have to see the guy 10 yards up get hacked to death with a machete before he wets himself and is hoping for the order to fall back. The dam also has towers every 50 yards or so. The legion captures a tower and they have a chance to regroup and move to the next one. Taking casualties of course but it's been firmly established they will not waver. Eventually the NCR breaks and the Legion has the topside of the dam.   The inside of the dam may have more causalities for the legion but the results will be the same. The legion will storm through and eventually the NCR will break. Once the legion has the inside of the dam they can move up and pop up behind or to the side of the NCR and a green recruit with multiple moving targets will panic regardless of the weapon he is holding.  The hardest part will be the entrance area but at that point I think the NCR will have cut it's losses and retreat."
fnv,3brbp4,J-Nice,3,Wed Jul 1 20:58:23 2015 UTC,"I figure Ulysses might come over and have a look at whoever stole his revenge.  The Legion has a very nice Intelligence Service, somehow managing to install a Spy right into McCarran. Managed to make some dissatisfied NCR Officer into a Spy is something to behold. And he probably still thinks he's doing it for the best of the NCR because the Mojave will bleed them dry.  Still not as much of an Idiot as Chief Hanlon, who actually tells you how the Aquifers back west are running dry while sitting on top of a Lake full of clean Water and tells you how the Mojave is bleeding them dry. Unless you can pull some desalination Plants from your Hat just point the NCR to some alternative Source of Water, would you?  But whatever. If the Legion attacks with no Courier to save the NCR, the NCR would get slaughtered.  NCR Soldiers have apparently two weeks of Training so the Service Rifles which are in bad repair most of the time won't do them much good. The Legion won't win Vegas since who ever is there at that point, Benny or House would probably like the NCR better. I figure if pressed, even Pacer of the Kings would rather have the NCR than the Legion around, since it's rather likely that the Legion would just Firebomb the whole city to build it anew.  But i don't think the Legion would get that far. With Cesar's Brain exploding Lanius would be in Charge and he doesn't strike me as sophisticated Strategist.  Nope, he'd probably attack Helios one straight on and push his Army right over the open Field as far as the Enemies' Scopes can see. He'd grind up whatever remained of the Battlegroup that captured the Dam and eventually gather that he doesn't have an Army to go to War with. There wouldn't be enough Survivors to even hold the Dam.  While the NCR would have to keep the Garrison at McCarran strong, they'll be harassed by Fiends if there is no one to exterminate the Leaders.  So no side has enough man power to even grab the Dam and hold it against anyone unless Benny manages to break into the Lucky 38 somehow or more likely, is let in under the guise of not being noticed and then killed, so House now has the Chip.  But then House still wouldn't have access to the Securitrons under Fortification hill.  No one being able to attack of defend the Dam would open up another possibility. Brotherhood of Steel captures the Dam. The Great Hkans, what's left of them, might even help since by then they might have gathered that they have been betrayed, so stabbing the Legion in the back when the Opportunity arises might be in their best interest.  After the Brotherhood captures the Dam, they send an envoy out to McCarran to give up the Dam in exchange for the end of Hostilities against the Brotherhood of Steel.  After all the Clusterfuck, Lanius would probably find himself either captured or on a Cross, depends on who catches him first in the ensuing manhunt."
fnv,3brbp4,Madenmann,4,Wed Jul 1 21:41:29 2015 UTC,"It all depends on Benny.  If he offs House, activates the new Securitron protocols, and supports the NCR, the Legion gets slaughtered just as if the Courier wasn't there.   Now, knowing what we know about Benny being a conniving self-important cunt, he'd likely just use the Securitrons to push out the other Strip owners, while not realizing the advantage of helping the NCR at the dam.  NCR still wins, but is severely weakened in the region due to the Legion being reinforced by the Khans (remember, only the Courier can prevent that), and Benny kicks them out of Vegas. Because he's a cunt.   BoS, Boomers, and Followers are all up in the air.  Their stories all sort of depend on the Courier. The BoS pretty much dies off, the Followers remain an overworked clinic for junkies, and the Boomers have to move because of fucking ants."
fnv,3brbp4,AJockeysBallsack,2,Wed Jul 1 19:02:00 2015 UTC,"In the short term, I'd say the Legion. Lanius is a really good and fierce commander coming from all the info that we have. In addition, they have spies and other strategic outposts throughout the Mojave that is ready to close in on Hoover Dam. Looking at the Map of the Mojave that we have, Cottonwood Cove is towards the South of the Dam with Nipton under Legion control and can block supply access coming the Long 15 through the Mojave Outpost. The Legion is poised for a strategic takeover. Now, let's look at the interventions of the Courier which won't have been there. Camp McCarran had spies which would still be there to do sabotage and espionage. The Great Khans would be on the side of the Legion. President Kimball would be dead. Chief Hanlon was poised to retreat and bug out, taking with him the best of NCR troops - elite rangers. Now, for strength and force assessment; the NCR army has many troopers which are mostly average. If we count quality of the troops, then the average troopers in the NCR would be slightly better than the recruits of Legion in terms of equipment. The Higher ranked Primes would be slightly better if not the same as the troopers. The Heavy Infantry would be better than all except probably the Centurions in terms of equipment. The NCR rangers and elites would overpower almost all but the Legate in the Legion. As such, the NCR is slightly stronger in terms of sheer strength and equipment; and we have yet to count the Vertibirds which can be very decisive. Not only that, the NCR has won several major wars against Great Khans, Enclave and Brotherhood. They are veterans of war. In all of this, we assume that New Vegas remains neutral and not part of the war, the Archimedes prowess is left untouched and the special elites like Boone are not being utilized. Now for the force movements and war-gaming: As soon as President Kimball is assassinated, the Legion would begin their assault on Hoover Dam. The NCR would be thrown into disarray but General Oliver would hold the fort and keep Legion troops at the Dam at bay. By this time, all the spies doing their espionage and sabotage would already have succeeded on what they set out to do and the NCR would already be weakened both physically and morally; McCarran would be unable to provide much assistance to the Dam. Furthermore, the Khans would sweep in from the West. Camp McCarran is blocked by Khan advancement and locked-down. The Mojave Outpost would send in reinforcements and supplies but this effort would be largely impeded by Legion in Nipton. Legion from Cottonwood would surge from the South and Forlorn Hope would really be forlorn hope. A legion three-prong attack from the East, West and South would force the NCR to retreat scatter and retreat North-west along the lake. General Oliver and majority of the NCR force would strategically move towards Camp Golf where Hanlon and his rangers would suggest to bug out back to NCR homeland in the West Coast. Oliver would also probably rig the damn to explode. They would move to recover McCarran and then head down through Goodsprings and hole up at the Mojave Outpost. Aftermath: The Dam is lost, Kimball dead and the casualties are great on both sides although the Legion may be greater. The NCR in Mojave would holdout at the Mojave Outpost which has a very good bottleneck feature as well as a great high ground advantage. Hoover Dam would be damaged and the resulting flood would destroy Cottonwood. The Legion has control over the Hoover Dam. For now. Post-conflict: NCR would regroup around Mojave Outpost while sending infiltrators into Mojave region. A full scale assault may ensue in revenge for killing Kimball and NCR would be assured a decisive victory against the Legion."

Spys in place at camp McCaren   Envoys convincing the Great Khans to attack the NCR from another front.

Caesar was just more prepared to win the battle.   Without the Mk II OS for the securitrons House could only hold the strip for a time.  his range was too short due to his main reactor being offline to affect the battle for the dam.      even if Caesar were to die from the brain tumor before the dam was conquered, Lanius was brutal enough to still take the region.

fnv,3bqyjy,theuncertaintortiose,6,Mon Jul 13 17:39:06 2015 UTC,"Everyone has their preferences between the two, so you're not necessarily doing anything wrong. I'll tell you what I like about NV (in some cases compared to 3) to show you some of the appeal.   There's more marked quests, and similarly more side quests for the various factions you come across (other than the Legion) than there were in 3. I usually go with the NCR, so the amount of side quests they have helps to make me feel like I'm actually furthering their cause in the Mojave apart from the main quests.   Likewise, I'm a fan of the reputation system as a supplement to the karma system. In one of my playthroughs I picked and chose quests so that I was beloved by everyone except the Powder Gangers. I thought it was interesting that the game had enough for me to do for each faction that I could help one without necessarily hurting another. Goodsprings/Powder Gangers was the only exception here.  I prefer the skill book, magazine, and implant system over skill books and bobbleheads. Similarly I was a fan of the traits in NV, which were absent in 3. There were also a wider variety of chems to help out with stats in NV, which could make combat interesting in some cases.   I felt the combat was better, though not by much. The only real improvement was the inclusion of iron sights and weapon mods, which if you play on PC aren't really an issue with 3.    Lastly I preferred the DLCs in NV. Old World Blues might be one of the best pieces of DLC I've ever played, and I also enjoyed Lonesome Road and Dead Money. Gun Runners Arsenal added some neat weapons and mods as well.   Overall I prefer NV. I played it first, so that might have something to do with it, but there are aspects of 3 I prefer. The quests were, in some cases, more memorable, as were some of the locations. And nothing really tops Liberty Prime. The radio in 3 is vastly superior to the one in NV. At some point though, it's really just personal preference. And if you find yourself unable to get into NV as much as 3, there's nothing wrong with that.   Edit: After reading some other comments, I forgot to mention the crafting system in NV is much more fleshed out, which I really like. I'm looking forward to seeing what they've added in FO4."
fnv,3bqyjy,rockshow4070,2,Wed Jul 1 14:28:50 2015 UTC,"Also that many side quests - while it may seem that some of them have ""best options"", it may change on your roleplay goals.  In my current playthrough I decide to be a complete New Vegas loyalist. So while I want to push the legion out as much as NCR does, I also want maximum casualties and amount of trouble for NCR, while not taking the blame.  So what did I do? Falsified the report for the misfits, pit the kings against NCR in freeside, let Motor-runner live, let Cass go on a roaring rampage of revenge, and so on."
fnv,3bqyjy,Gothic90,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:23:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much, sometimes I think the simplicity of creation, karma, and the lack of variety is what I liked about FO3 so much, and that adding relationships and more chems and weapons and things that weren't so very obvious made the game seem daunting to me.

The fact that it's all there if I want to mess with it makes me enjoy the game that much more, because that means there's stuff I'm still discovering or getting the hang of. It helps to keep subsequent playthroughs interesting."
fnv,3bqyjy,TheBoris,10,Wed Jul 1 20:59:58 2015 UTC,"So what am I doing wrong?   Never tried to play an RPG, perhaps?   I seriously fail to understand how people can play a game like FO3, where 1st level character (teenager) takes out the whole vault security (while in original games you'd be in trouble if cornered by 3-4 rats), where people build a town around a nuke just so the player can blow up it later (I don't see any other reason), where vampires (in a Fallout game?) are feeding on locals and locals start hating you if you kill vampires, where children live next to supermutants and those don't mind them at all (probably thanks to children being magically invulnerable), where the ending includes the protagonist sacrificing himself while there are a lot of logical options available around. And so on. I could go on and on.  Maybe just lack of all this BS is what's wrong with FNV and makes it ""boring"" for some people? I don't know. For me F:NV is more or less adequate continuation of the series, that has a lot of RP options - and FO3 is a bastard child, flashy but awfully retarded."
fnv,3bqyjy,TheBoris,3,Wed Jul 1 17:14:29 2015 UTC,"I don't understand your comment, traditional RPG's like FF, or action RPG's like LOZ have you using magic and teleporting.  If I can shoot magic at dwarves, then a teenager can wipe out a security force.  It may not suit the series, but I think that's what troubles me, is that I don't like the rest of the series as much, but want to.  If you were starting a playthrough for the first time what would you do first?"
fnv,3bqyjy,wjdp,7,Wed Jul 1 18:39:46 2015 UTC,"RPG doesn't mean ""using magic"". RPG means role-playing. In FO3 you're restricted to the protagonist Beth set up for you - a teenage boy (or girl) who grew up in the vault. In FNV you start with a blank character, who has no history - you are free to develop your character in any way you want. You are not restricted to a single ending - you can side up with either NCR, Legion or Mr. House, or become a ruler of New Vegas yourself. There is no RP element in FO3 whatsoever. You just follow the script and all you can choose are the dialogue options - between ""I missed you, daddy"" and ""Daddy, I missed you"".   If I can shoot magic at dwarves, then a teenager can wipe out a security force.   Try ""shooting magic at dwarves"" in Skyrim/Requiem. Unless you're at level 35-40, you'll be annihilated in seconds. That's called ""character growth"". At level 1-2 you fight crabs, not city guards - those would kill you in one hit, magic or not. Dumbing it down like Beth did in FO3 just removes any sense from character growth.    If you were starting a playthrough for the first time what would you do first?   I'd started where I started - with Fallout 1/2. Those games are the foundation, and, if I may say so, still the benchmark of RPGs - along with Baldur's Gate, Planescape - Torment and others. JRPGs, sorry... aren't exactly RPGs. I don't see a freedom of choosing and developing your own unique character there."
fnv,3bqyjy,SalsaRice,3,Wed Jul 1 19:03:30 2015 UTC,"F3 was probably the first RPG I played properly, and without a bit of hand holding I may not have stuck with it. For this 'audience' they struck the RP / Linear story line very well."

See how that plays out with the rest of the wastes. The thing to remember is everything is angling for the finish. If you really are not into it, but want to finish at least once, do an NCR play through. They'll get you geared up and taken care of as you go.   If you like exploring, I suggest wandering around. Lots of nooks and crannies in the map and lots of unmarked quests and the like. When you play FO3, I'm sure you don't just do the main quest, which is boring after 3 Dog. Same thing here.   Also, you can totally gamble in the casinos, as well as make weapons, repair kids, doctor's bags, ammo, armor and on and on. The workbench part of the game is a lot of fun if that's what you are into.  As to role playing- pick a movie character you like (Liam in Taken, for instance) and play that person all the way through. What weapons would he use? What skills? Who would he side with?

I felt the game had a lot of repetitive quests at the point I was, I know I should have pressed on but the whole ""go here, get this, report back"" without a lot of obvious branching paths is hard.  I wish I knew how my relationships affected everything a bit better."
fnv,3bqyjy,Gothic90,2,Wed Jul 1 18:34:38 2015 UTC,"the whole ""go here, get this, report back"" without a lot of obvious branching paths is hard.   You will almost never be told the outcome of the decisions you make immediately, in the case of major decisions, and sometimes even minor ones will have an impact. Sometimes there is no impact beyond the quest(s) themselves, and other times, you will be closing off whole avenues of questlines, or even whole factions. Many ""fetch"" quests exist as a means to force the player to navigate the wastes, where some random encounters can occur (Malcolm, assassins, etc).  The branching is most often in terms of ""which quest givers"" and less about ""which quests"". Helping NCR citizens will tend towards making the NCR stronger, etc. Helping the legion helps the legion, etc. It's not universal, and I've seen more than a few examples where you can start out with good intentions and take a misstep along the way that can ruin your desired outcome (the tram station comes to mind, as does vault 22(?)).  I'd run with it, personally - the endings will tell you what you did and how it played out, with respect to the major decisions, and the minor ones are mostly just texture. Aside from a few scenic points, most of FNV is the background and flavor of the journey itself, not ending-related. I do recommend playing the DLC in order.  Are FO3/FNV your first times out with the series?   I wish I knew how my relationships affected everything a bit better.   A pipe dream. This was never intended, as far as I can see. The premise is that you'd do what you wanted to do, and the chips would fall where they would as a result - your best indicator of your relationships is the faction status screen, and even that's vague (intentionally!).   You're not working around a fulcrum to shift the ending on way or another, you are the fulcrum and the game will end depending on which end of the lever you're giving the advantages to..."

fnv,3bqyjy,islander1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:09:32 2015 UTC,"FNV's act 1 is fairly long and does not offer as much freedom as FO3 or Skyrim. In Skyrim you can basically go anywhere once you reach Whiterun, but in FNV this period of ""reaching new vegas"" is much longer.  So, for multiple play-throughs, I suggest the alternative start mod. You can start as a member of BoS, Enclave, Follower, Legion slave and so on, starting at different locations."

fnv,3boje7,Rememberpls,47,Tue Jun 30 21:39:03 2015 UTC,"To understand what the Legion is, you need to talk to Caesar. Supporting the Legion isn't something you do if you like their current way of things; it's something you do if you want to support what Caesar would like them to become.  Caesar is a nationalist, uncompromising, unflinchingly brutal, manipulative, loyal, gives his knowledge and resources to improve those around him, and he is a luddite. All of these play a role in his long term plan. They also play a role in why that plan may or may not work. To compare him to other characters in the series, he's somewhere between the Master and Ashur.  Caesar believes that the only way to eliminate the wars and petty squabbles that divide humanity is by forging everyone into one nation with a homogenous culture. He is going about this by launching a series of wars and petty squabbles that everyone but him must lose. That is a necessity as he sees it - the only way for humanity to survive is by following his ideology and most will need it delivered on the edge of a machete.  He believes mankind will only survive if all individuals put society before themselves. He creates a feedback loop to achieve this - those who do the most good for society get the best positions and status as rewards. Others then seek to emulate this path to success. It is diametrically opposed to the NCR system of individual rewards - people like Heck Gunderson in the NCR get wealth and influence and use that to buy other's wealth, strengthening only themselves. The Legion doesn't have a concept of private property beyond personal belongings - cattle aren't Heck Gunderson's cattle, they're society's cattle. The Legion was founded on this concept - Caesar was captured by a sloppy, unorganized group of tribals as a young man, back when his name was Ed Sallow. The group was going to be destroyed by another tribe slightly less sloppy and disorganized, and Ed wasn't going to die like that.  Using his friend Joshua, who had also been captured, as a translator, Ed taught the tribals everything he remembered about military tactics from pre-war books. The tribe was trained by a prisoner they eventually made their leader, and they crushed their enemies. Ed made a habit of it, forming the Legion over decades.   The Legion he formed is the second phase of his plan. The phase he is trying to transition into during New Vegas is he wants to make a republic. For that, he needs Hoover Dam and a sparkling jewel of a city he can turn into a new Rome. He must also conquer a lot of NCR territory, and eventually all of it. As he explains in a talk about Hegelian dialectics, the Legion and NCR are diametrically opposed and cannot exist in the same place at the same time. If one absorbs the other, both are effectively destroyed and form something new out of the best parts of both.  Caesar has some fatal flaws to his plan. He underestimates humanity's ability for corruption. It's evident in the game in several places, but nowhere is it more damning than in the Legion's treatment of women. Caesar respects women and will without hesitation explain how they are the most important part of his society for keeping logistics going and birthing the generations that will grow up knowing nothing but his ideology. This message gets corrupted and by the time it reaches the common Legionary, their interpretation is to treat women like pack mules and sex slaves. Maybe this will get fixed when the Legion gets transitioned to a republic. Maybe it won't.   The other major flaw in Caesar's plan is it requires a charismatic, intelligent, educated person who will also commit unspeakable violent acts without hesitation to be the center of a cult of personality and be the single point of central authority. After Caesar dies, if his successor is not all of those, the Legion will crumble, quick and violent.  What you need to ask yourself is if this is a horse you feel comfortable backing and then slam your bet down."

Sure you can take what Sawyer said and what's in the bible, but if they are so prosperous, why are they losing the war?  I'm sure trade/production is pretty high in Arizona, but idk. They aren't a trade giant, no traders in the Mojave seem to be clamoring for their goods. Their technology is weak, they don't use medicine. They seem to excel at only producing soldiers and slaves.   Sure, one can argue that a ""free"" citizen has a relatively good life, compared to before. But it still feels like an oppressive, militaristic, sexist regime. I mean they use slaves for god's sake. They crucify towns for resisting their rule. It's very clear that all the Legion respects is power, and anyone without it is probably treated like shit.   This glorifying of the Legion that goes on is disturbing to me. If you are trapped in Arizona I can see having to bite your tongue, but for the rest of the Wastes, idk I'd rather take my chances. There are better options.   Vault 101 was not sustainable.

Caesar was just more prepared to win the battle.   Without the Mk II OS for the securitrons House could only hold the strip for a time.  his range was too short due to his main reactor being offline to affect the battle for the dam.      even if Caesar were to die from the brain tumor before the dam was conquered, Lanius was brutal enough to still take the region.

There aren't as many Legion-related quests, and the game skews hard in favor of some of the other factions as you approach the endgame, meaning that it is almost impossible to truly roleplay as a Legion supporter (IMO).   To answer the overall question, they do improve security and safety in areas where they operate - you run into several people throughout the game who admit that it's better to travel through Legion-controlled areas because there aren't any bandits/raiders/etc. But, they do kill viciously and brutally in order to accomplish that result."

fnv,3boje7,Brrieck,3,Wed Jul 1 06:13:25 2015 UTC,"They don't have any obtrusive bureaucracy unlike the NCR. everywhere you go in NCR territory you hear about how the NCR is too big for its own good and has too many problems to handle. This is in large part due to bureaucracy.  If the NCR catches someone stealing, they probably send them to some sort of jail, possibly give them a trial. Lots of time for a troublesome raider to get away. Think powder gangers and Primm. Legion, they just kill them and be done with it, next problem.  The bureaucracy also gets in the way of NCR military operations often. They're usually woefully undersupplied because they can't operate efficiently.   Think of it also this way: while most stories go from utopia > distopia, Caesar's idea is to go from distopia > utopia by uniting a nation under strict rule, and once a system is in place, the rules will no longer be needed and everyone will live in peace.   It's a crazy idea, but it sounds like it could work if the person in power doesn't loose their head. Could. Both nations are kind of set up to fail because of poor management and sheer scale."
fnv,3boje7,IsaacClarkeSNL,3,Wed Jul 1 04:40:03 2015 UTC,"The main issue with the Legion, is that they're like Prussia (but they fit better as the Mongol Empire): unlike most states who have an army, it's an army with a state. So perhaps Caesar is also like Alexander the Great, because while Alexander the Great was an acceptable politician and great general, he was better at destroying institutions rather than building them since his bureaucratic expertise was mainly just naming things after himself.  Caeser is pretty much at the same level, and does the same thing due to his simple tech preference, He destroys settlements and old world works, when these settlements and old world infrastructures and technologies have the opportunity to provide a massive amount of good. The only thing that he has that really stabilises his realm is his homogenous new culture society, yet this is slowly eroding at the lowest levels. I think the Frumentarii are perhaps the best realisation of this, because the kennel master, and Ulysses (of course, a Frumentarii himself) still have evident signs that they still retain some of their bandit-tribal identity, which will probably grow within the culture. But pretty much, as soon as Caeser dies, his murderdog, Lanius, won't do anything to establish anything. Caeser states that he wants Vegas as a capital city, so this is when he plans on finally establishing long-term political institutions. But I'm sure that as soon as they can, some Generals will probably split into smaller armies as soon as Lanius can't solve a famine by beating brahmin to death."

Dead Money has always been level 25+ for me and I make sure to level melee to breeze through the enemies and get to the story segments.   Do a Lonesome Road at any time you want afterwards but I usually do it near End-Game. You can use the Pip-boy to find where each of the DLC entrances are. This is only the path I take, so you don't have to copy it.  For a second playthrough, level up as much as you can before running the DLCs. Also, build up rep with the Brotherhood and talk to Veronica about her mentor. Making sure you have as many options as possible going through each of the DLCs adds a bunch of cool dialogue.
