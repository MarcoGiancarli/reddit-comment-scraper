FutureFight,3e4i2v,nexus_polaris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:03:24 2015 UTC,"I'm in the exact same situation -- hit 5* just this morning. I've been debating between Ignore Dodge and Crit Rate. His HP is already super high and I don't feel as though he's well-served by making him even tankier without boosting his damage; Ignore Dodge has the potential to increase damage by as much as 30% across the board [against targets that dodge!], while even a 50% crit rate gear will only improve overall damage by around 10-15%, so my very vague intuition would be that you should go for Ignore Dodge if you plan to use him in the Arena, and go for Crit Rate if you already have a solid Arena team and plan to use him more for story mode & VS."
FutureFight,3e4i2v,Extranationalidad,2,Wed Jul 22 00:22:58 2015 UTC,I put Crit Rate on him. Seems to be very effective so far
FutureFight,3e4i2v,menas0r,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:57:34 2015 UTC,Special gear? I run ignore dodge - you absolutely do not want a Crashing Foot Falls strike to miss.  I rolled skill cooldown on his 4th and obviously HP on his 3rd but I'm still testing defense penetration as well for the 4th.  I have Bloodthirst on him right now because 1. It was the first good set that appeared and I didn't want to drop 4-5 million more to get Angry Hulk and 2. He is a big target and vulnerable to damage during CFF so the shield is handy plus it still gives a great attack bonus as well.
FutureFight,3e4i2v,toysoldierxiii,3,Tue Jul 21 22:10:26 2015 UTC,Ignore dodge...does it actually work?? never tested it before. I thought dodge would be better for a tank like him...he'd never die :)
FutureFight,3e4i2v,toysoldierxiii,2,Tue Jul 21 22:13:57 2015 UTC,"It does technically work, just not how we were expecting. My testing shows that it reduces dodge by the % - 70% dodge enemy vs your 50% dodge ignore means they are rocking 35% instead.  And of course Dodge is best for everyone but I would feel disgustingly dirty abusing a clearly broken mechanic. Plus not much can survive a full 5 hits from CFF - the best defense is a good offense, make sure they all hit."

FutureFight,3e2ufx,jakajak,3,Tue Jul 21 15:09:23 2015 UTC,"AoE is key.  Off the top of my head I'd give it to G-Man - 4th skill will completely clear entire areas in one cast, 3rd skill will clear entire sections (i.e. separated by bridges and stuff), and his 1st and 2nd are also PBAoEs."
FutureFight,3e2ufx,toysoldierxiii,3,Tue Jul 21 15:37:55 2015 UTC,My level 35 Giant Man clears way faster than my lvl 40 uVision or lvl40 WM. Give him AntMan and YJ as teammates and watch boss melt after 2 consecutive rank5 skill.
FutureFight,3e2ufx,yellising,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:31 2015 UTC,This is the team I am currently leveling up and it is beastly. I see it easily replacing my Ronan/uVision team as #1.   I have everyone geared for attack speed and Ant-Man as leader for the speed boost. More attacks = more procs = even more destruction. I'm loving it.
FutureFight,3e2ufx,r0b456,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:39 2015 UTC,"Is attack speed really helpful here? As far as I know, it doesn't affect skills, so its impact is pretty limited at 5*, when so little of your time is spent using basic attacks."
FutureFight,3e2ufx,tegeusCromis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:19 2015 UTC,"At 5, probably but my team is currently only 4 so I still have a bit of a gap between skills and the extra attack speed seems to keep my ISO procs and the Ant-Man costume procs up constantly, which is what seems to help my team clear stages that should be far beyond their ability. I'm also playing around with using Yellow Jacket as my leader to get that 2 second paralyze effect on attacks and that seems to work well also.   But yeah, once I get 5* and have an extra ability in the rotation I will change everything over to skill cool down and auto attacks will become meaningless."
FutureFight,3e2ufx,r0b456,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:54:43 2015 UTC,"That sounds reasonable in theory. However, I suspect that the boost is so small that it's barely worth it even if you use nothing but basic attacks. If you have a mastered Gamora, compare your attack speed on the same speed hero with her leadership and without. I doubt you'll even feel a difference. At least, I can't."
FutureFight,3e2ufx,tegeusCromis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:29 2015 UTC,Who's your third on Ronan/uVision?  I wanted to try Thor for the cooldown team buff but his Bio's are hard to get so I've been using Captain Marvel and will probably move onto Ultron for better strikers now that he his 3*.
FutureFight,3e2ufx,TrackXII,2,Wed Jul 22 02:16:56 2015 UTC,"This is a tougher question than it seems. Some heroes are efficient at clearing tough stages, but not at clearing lower stages. An example is Ultron, whose animations are longer than they need to be against weak mobs. Then there's the fact that some heroes bloom later than others, meaning that ""same gear and skill levels"" isn't enough for a comparison: you need to have a specific level in mind.  That said, overall, I like War Machine. Clash is extremely quick and hits a group. Suppressing Fire autotargets new enemies when current targets die. And Minigun (lol) Barrage is quick and great against all enemies, alone or in groups, weak or strong. The only downside is his beam, which is pretty inefficient in the hands of the AI. But oh well, can't have everything.  Edit: I don't have Giant-Man leveled, though."
FutureFight,3e2ufx,tegeusCromis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:40:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  Ultron is a beast on some of the tougher levels, but my level 40 4* has died twice on AP+ vs a level 35 spiderman :("

Works really well to let Destroyer or Ronan whiff on an attack in VS and throw a couple at them. His second skill (the jump kick thing) does next to no damage, I'm convinced it must be a bug, but his arrow attacks from his first and third skills do a ton of damage and break.

This is a hard question to answer because part of it is completely situational; which characters had you not gotten around to by the time the newer shinier toys got released? I'm pretty sure Groot and Yondu would be on my ""super fun & leveling to 5"" list if I'd picked up some things in a different order or had a different sort of luck."

I have no interest in ranking up Ghost Rider, IronFist and Drax outside of what they get off random VS and Warp.  I haven't had a chance to do much with Ant-Man either as I've been focusing on GM instead.  Working the YellowJacket special missions now, so it'll rank him up as well and he'll likely get more play.  Also add Bullseye to the list, not because he isn't any good, but because I just don't like the weird pedo face, and the fact that he's a pain in the ass in VS.  And while we're at it, the same for Doc Oc.   Probably including the face as well :)"

FutureFight,3e41mj,tegeusCromis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:16:24 2015 UTC,"Vision is definitely worth farming.  He's considered by most to be a god tier hero.  His Phase Shift ability changes the game for him as well as his 4th passive that gives him invulnerability for a a bit.  So not only does he pack some big dps, he has the defensive chops to back that up too.  One of the strongest heroes in the game, IMO.  When you have the suit on, all the ranking up mats are still blaster.  So Norn Stones of Energy.  To be honest, for farming rifts, just because of energy usage, I typically just went tier 1.  Sure the bio drop rate is lower, but you can basically run it 3x for the cost of 1 tier 5 run, and you end up with more debris which is arguably just as important later on.    I have Vision on my must buy list for crystal usage, and currently there are only 2 heroes on that list, Vision and Malekith."
FutureFight,3e3emv,Skripclub,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:51 2015 UTC,"I'd keep it. (I actually rolled my YJ specifically looking for this or Ultron's Hatred.) Both those heroes are great kiters with safe skills, so you get a lot of use out of the +attack proc and don't really need much tankiness."
FutureFight,3e3emv,tegeusCromis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:30 2015 UTC,"Power of symbiote is similar to ultron's hatred. Both procs when attacking and boosts attack. Only difference is the type of iso used(which could mean physical or energy attack)(silver or red respectively). The iso sets also give one different stat boost, with p.o.s. giving hp and ultron's hatred giving def. Both are good. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REROLL. You might have to spend loads of gold before seeing this iso set again. Stick with it, its good enough :D"

FutureFight,3e3eiu,crash100200,2,Wed Jul 22 01:40:08 2015 UTC,"I try to use only heroes with ranged skills, long stuns/mult-hitstuns, or other kinds of very safe skills (e.g. Armoured Clash). It is too dangerous to hang around in melee range of Ronan. u/ssj4ric has given some especially good examples, but really any character with at least two of the kinds of skills I described will do."
FutureFight,3e3eiu,tegeusCromis,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed with several of the comments here; distance and stuns are key. 5* Ultron is a lovely character but just eats too many attacks against Ronan. Green Goblin is my absolute favorite; my 5* GG can wallop on him all day taking very little damage if you kite carefully, and I've solo'd rank 9 Ronan more than once."
FutureFight,3e3eiu,Extranationalidad,3,Tue Jul 21 18:13:54 2015 UTC,"Use Ronan against Ronan. He is naturally very tanky, and has very safe combo against well, himself. My 45/5 Ronan can solo the lv 9 Ronan VS."
FutureFight,3e3eiu,agent_patrick_star,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:32 2015 UTC,"It better be safe else it's not gonna be worth it. Not saying it's not possible, it's just that generally if the combo isn't safe or whiffs then the penalty will very high since this is VS 9 Bosses' damage that we are talking about and positioning ourselves within melee range is not the best thing we can do. I don't really play Ronan but I think the general idea is to avoid Melee type attacks against a melee boss."
FutureFight,3e3eiu,Zephyraine,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:37:23 2015 UTC,"You should try Ronan vs Ronan then. I agree that melee vs melee can be risky, but Ronan has so much crowd control that you can chain your combos without the enemy Ronan moving an inch. And when I say Ronan is tanky, he really is. Extremely. I am not saying you are supposed to be face tanking his attacks. It is just that when you miss a combo (which can be quite hard), you can still withstand a lot of damage. It allows much more tolerance when you make mistakes. When I use, say Spiderman (lv 45/5/5), a single arbitration take out 50% of my hp. With Ronan (lv 45/5/5 too) it will probably be 20% at most.  However, some people do prefer ranged heroes. Then by all means use them. Green Goblin will do the job just fine, just require a lot more kiting and dodging."

FutureFight,3e4b3s,BANNEDFROMALAMO,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:54:27 2015 UTC,I'm afraid you have to keep rolling until you land on the set on your character's set-bonus tab.   Just because you have the right ISOs equipped doesn't mean the set bonus will be applied - you have to reroll your set until you land on Ultron's Hatred...which can cost you quite a bit :(  Edit: But I sure wish you can simply equip the right ISOs to activate the desired set bonus..

FutureFight,3e3rzq,arkhampatient23,2,Tue Jul 21 19:01:32 2015 UTC,"I would switch, yes. Getting an addition 4 star will be a huge help for arena & villain seige. Personally, I'm using half of my daily specials on the YJ mission 4 and the other half on Giant Man mission 4 - which lets me trigger one run of unlimited each. Giant Man gets around 20 bios a day from about 17-18 runs, and YJ less than that - but extra Wasp & Ant Man bios."
FutureFight,3e3rzq,chmsax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:09:11 2015 UTC,Cool thanks for the advice. for giant man you're supposed to run the third mission right?
FutureFight,3e3rzq,dann511,4,Tue Jul 21 19:23:10 2015 UTC,When not doing the unlimited run go for the highest you can do without anyone dying. When you activate it go for the highest you can do in reasonable amount of time (1:00 ~ 1:30 depending on your team). The goal is to do as many runs as possible for maximum bio drops
FutureFight,3e3rzq,chmsax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:03:37 2015 UTC,"What Dann said is exactly accurate. Personally, I do mission 4, because I'm simultaneously levelling up my 5-star Vision from 40 to 45 (and using the other two slots to level up other characters), and that allows me the flexibility of definitely being able to clear the level on auto with no supervision."
FutureFight,3e3rzq,Blitqz21l,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:46:56 2015 UTC,"I would also add that in unlimited runs, the only caveat is the amount of energy you have in regards to your shield level.  Thus if you only have 70 energy max, plan your runs around that number.  Meaning with basically 5-6 new energy when you start, you could do 12 runs.  So plan around that in planning unlimited runs.  No point in running a lower level and burning through all of your energy in 20 minutes when you could have done a higher tier and gotten more bios."

FutureFight,3e3rzq,tegeusCromis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:20:25 2015 UTC,"Not just his leadership. He has a really good kit, too. People mistake his relatively poor chaining for weakness, but there's more to a skill set than how well the skills flow."
FutureFight,3e3rzq,dann511,2,Tue Jul 21 21:26:54 2015 UTC,I actually find his chaining and his animation canceling pretty nice and smooth if you're doing it manually. Auto on ronan does indeed suck very much.
FutureFight,3e3rzq,SuperShadowStar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"I agree, I love his chain. I go:  Law Enforcer>Tip the Scales>Universal Weapon>run up a bit>Arbitration  Law causes hit stun and starts the long cooldown, Tip gets you lined up properly and breaks, Universal then is lined up perfectly causing more hit stun, during their recovery you run up with your AOE fear to buy time.

It's highly situational depending on your team. Anyways if you have a very strong Blast type character that you use to plow through the runs for you, you might want to continue farming YJ since he is currently bugged to be COMBAT type in the Special Missions. This means that if your main is a Blast type, you can farm YJ faster right now as compared to when they change him back to what he is supposed to be. They will undoubtly patch this up and change him back to Blast type eventually just like what they did to MODOK who was also a Combat type in Daily Mission 4. This really only applies if you have a main Blast type that can plow through with ease. If you're using a Universal or Combat type, then this is irrelevant."

Get him to 40, get his skills to 20 or 25, get him a nice 6-slot iso-8 set, those will all help you a lot more at this stage than getting one extra level of gear. His mastery provides nice stats as well, although the leadership skill is only useful in certain circumstances."
FutureFight,3e502y,Extranationalidad,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:42:00 2015 UTC,"It really depends on you and your gold situation, and your hero situation.  For me, I really don't consider myself to have a main hero, per se.  I use Vision probably more than all my other heroes, but I'm not set in stone on him.  But since I know I've used him and will continue to do so, I've leveled up his gear to 12/12/12/12.  Takes a ton of rift debris.  Thus for most of your heroes, it's probably not wise to go beyond 9/9/9/9 to avoid dimension debris as a mat.  Also, I'm not completely sold on how much you gain the higher you go.  Sure, when you get the extra option slot, that's big, and worth it for min/maxing.  Skills are arguably the easiest to level up, but also do the least.  But it's good to make sure they are at a decent level.  For me, I try to get all my level 40's to lvl 20 skills.  With my 5*'s getting to 25, and a few high damage dealers to 30+  IE Malekith's AetherBolt.  In terms of ISO's.  Less than lvl 40, it's a personal choice, but for me, I don't worry about it.  I'll put a starter 1* in for the set bonus, but realistically with the way re-roll works, it's not wise to put any really good ISO's on them because you might have to either destroy them or spend crystals to take them out.  Thus, when a hero hits 40, I re-roll them to a 6piece set bonus, and put 3* ISO's in.  I try not to upgrade those depending on if I plan on getting the hero to 6*.  Same situation applies with re-rolls.  It can easily cost you a 200k to get an 8 piece set bonus.  Basically ISO's is a massive massive gold sink.  So beware."
FutureFight,3e502y,Blitqz21l,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:47:20 2015 UTC,"WAR : WHAT IS IT GOOD FORRRR  I leave my mains' gears at +12, the rest all +9, completely useless VS fodder +5.

You get the extra option abilities at 12 so I'd probably level the weapon for more damage and maybe one of the better defensive pieces depending on what stats are on what."

When I first got her I thought that she would be godlike, but after getting her to 40, playing for a while she's... meh. I feel like Gamora's a much better version of her. The only good thing about Angela is her ""Angel's war rage"" skill, doing massive damage against bosses. Against tons of enemies around her, she struggles a lot because only 1 of her skills is AoE, rest of them wont change targets after killing the first guy. She's also very easy to kill."
FutureFight,3e34h9,xDave9teen,2,Tue Jul 21 16:46:43 2015 UTC,I agree as well and think that Gamora is better than Angela. I have Gamora 5* and she's definitely worth investing in. My Angela is 4* and Gamora at 5*. Gamora is very tricky when playing against her in Vs. She's always hopping around and stuff making it hard to land abilities against her...

FutureFight,3e34h9,Nelfrey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:49 2015 UTC,She's only good after a shield proc ISO set and a TON of dodge. She's a glass cannon so without these things she's... meh.
FutureFight,3e34h9,average_nobody,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:51 2015 UTC,"She's actually my favorite, and she's quite lethal with the right gear. I have her at 5* with the Killer Instinct ISO set, and she'll single-handedly wipe out an entire JI team in Arena, even when some of them are lvl 50.  When timed right, the last couple of War Rage's hits will interrupt Spidey's web shot, and that pretty much seals his fate.    She's not without her shortcomings, though: as others have said, the term Glass Cannon definitely applies. Her HP is on the low side, but stacking All Defense and a 35% Dodge special gear helps mitigate a lot of damage. She's not the best at clearing crowds, but still holds her own because of her speed and kiting ability. Her 5* skill is a nice AoE that also breaks on the last couple of hits, with a high-damage sweep at the end. My only real complaint about it is that she moves around too much while using it, so it doesn't always hit as many enemies as it could.    Her skill rotation cycles fast enough to take the lvl 49 Destroyer in VS down to 2/3 health before the first wave of falling rocks. Her attacks break frequently enough that he never gets a chance to hit back.    I know there are plenty of other heroes that hit harder, tank better, etc... but I end up playing the characters I like, rather than the ones that have the highest numbers. I'm an old-school Spawn fan, so I was glad to see her integrated into the Marvel universe.    Yeesh, sorry for the wordy reply..."

Your priority should be to level up your anti matter generator, then the warp mission device (because that provides bios). Once you're producing a good amount of anti-matter and have the warp device giving you 10+ bios/day then the bio converter works to deal with those trash bios (ghost rider, etc) in order to get better/rarer bios like hulkbuster, black cat, etc."

FutureFight,3dzcda,risinginthesky,3,Tue Jul 21 00:30:43 2015 UTC,"While I understand the bottom part of the map for Ronan, it seems to me like you are just looking to trap yourself in a corner.  Which is why I try to avoid that area for the most part.  Another thing:  the very 1st special gear we got, the one that the game gave us, slow resist, is perfect against Bullseye.  I'd equip it to a blaster character like Vision, Yellow Jacket, or War Machine.  Makes Bulleye 7-9 pretty easy.  In terms of Speedsters, you forgot Green Goblin.  Personally, I don't like switching toons in stages for the simple reason that the stage, for the most part, gets harder as you go deeper.  I think from a pure damage standpoint, you are better served doing 1 at a time since the best time to do the most damage is in the 1st minute of most stages, especially Bullseye and Doc Oc.  And for clafification, I don't have an issue clearing vs9 daily.  In terms of Destroyer, there are a lot of characters that get rid of the lava lag bomb.  Characters that exit the screen all do this, Ant Man, Vision, Spiderman are all good examples.  So you don't have to swap heroes, just choose the right ones and you'll get rid of it and do damage Destroyer at the same time.  Also note, this same trick applies to lasers, though in terms of ramp up time for some of the moves, you might be dead before move goes off."

FutureFight,3dzcda,agent_patrick_star,3,Tue Jul 21 06:34:03 2015 UTC,"Hmm I know everyone has different playstyle, so what I am saying might not suit everybody, but here goes:  I think running a single hero per round is the best way to go. Some people I know could not manage to reach/beat lv 9 because they use  2-3 heroes per run. Firstly, you are not optimising the damage each hero can do in 2 minutes. Sure, sometimes 2 or 3 are just enough, but there will be times where the potential damage is wasted since you cannot use the hero again. Second, yes you can dodge stage obstacles by switching out, but that gives you a higher tendency of being reckless. I saw a post yesterday where a guy was complaining about his team of 5 and 4 stars being decimated by lv 7 Ock lasers, and he wasnt able to reach lv 9 yet. One guy is not a representative sample, I know, but it is a possible situation. I managed to finish my first lv 9 with only 8 four stars and a bunch of lower levels. For me, kiting all the way enables me to remember the meteor and laser timing on the back of my head. It makes people more careful in their attack, and to not over commit a combo. Why risk zerging down and getting killed if you can kite and pick your shots much more safely for two whole minutes?  I also think speedsters you mentioned arent just 'not bad' for Siege. They are much more useful than Luke Cage, Hulkbuster, and arguably than the other 3 combat heroes. They allow you to kite much more safely while picking shots and dealing a lot of damage. Gamora is hands down one of the top VS heroes. Spidey, Sharon Carter and GG are very good as well. I think leveling these heroes is more important than their combat counterparts. They will be especially useful when lv7 and 9 Destroyer come up."
FutureFight,3dzcda,Blitqz21l,3,Tue Jul 21 03:39:45 2015 UTC,"Once your characters are higher level and properly geared, zerging is legit. Check my in-game profile to get an idea why it works.   Also, I wouldn't discount a 5-Star Hulkbuster. The AI might use it like a 800 lb gorilla on a pogo stick with a shotgun as accurate as a storm trooper, but it's entirely different when you put money in his Skill/Gear slots."
FutureFight,3dzcda,agent_patrick_star,3,Tue Jul 21 03:41:59 2015 UTC,"I did check your in-game profile, and again, as agent-patrick-star mentioned, your guide is for beginner and intermediate players.  You have 8 heroes at 5* all them 45 with the exception of 1 at 43.  You have 7 at 40 all 4* with 1 exception at 3*.  You can zerg because you can overwhelm the villains.    Most beginners aren't going to come close to that kind of fire power.  In fact, a lot of them will have mostly 1* to 2* and just a few 3* heroes.  That is not a recipe for zerg success.  It's a recipe to get their asses kicked."
FutureFight,3dzcda,Blitqz21l,4,Tue Jul 21 06:37:02 2015 UTC,"It might work, yes. I am not saying it is not possible. But your title said this is a guide for beginner/intermediate players. Kiting will allow them to learn more about the timing of the bosses' attacks. Soon dodging and picking shots will be just about reflex. Right now I am still doing kiting. And on good days I can use only 9 heroes (4 five stars, lv 45) in total to finish all 9 VS stages. Bad days maybe 10-15 heroes.  Edit: Let me elaborate more. Beginners dont have that many heroes yet. Dont waste multiple heroes on a single boss. Also, their heroes might not have 3 or 4 active skills yet. It is a lot harder to zerg down. Which is why for beginners, kite is better. Remember, the title of your post said Beginner players. Not players with multiple 5* heroes. High level players dont need to bother about VS strategy. It is easy enough for most of us. Hell I can even beat VS playing with my toes, while hanging upside down a tree and eating a sandwich."

FutureFight,3dzcda,princesparklefists,2,Tue Jul 21 04:29:26 2015 UTC,"great info. I still struggle with Doc Oc no matter who I use, or how I kite. I feel like I'm wasting good players to whittle him down a few percentages when I start a special and get locked in place to a laser.   When you farm Dailies, do you also still get your Daily Achievements done and then circle back with whatever energy you have? I'm only a casual spender, and use my freebies when I run out."
FutureFight,3dzcda,Doc_Whooves,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:11 2015 UTC,I believe you get an achievement for clearing 1 Daily and another for a weekly. Both gets you energy.   Achievement cleared 1 Daily = 15 Energy (roughly close to 4 runs to break even or net gain of 11 Energy if you don't farm that Daily)   Achievement cleared 30 Daily = 35 Energy
FutureFight,3dzcda,Doc_Whooves,2,Mon Jul 20 21:15:53 2015 UTC,"""You'll be zerging or rushing down these bosses as opposed to traditional kiting you've experienced in Story mode since there is a 2 minute timer per try.""  Not sure I follow. I don't fight VS bosses much differently than I do regular bosses. Actually, I feel like their traps might make me kite even more. I'd much rather take potshots and go the distance than risk losing a character in the first 30 seconds."
FutureFight,3dzcda,pksullivan,2,Mon Jul 20 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"Ronan - Kite down towards the bottom corner (no generators), cycle specials, switch characters, repeat.  Destroyer - Cycle Specials, switch characters, cycle, etc.  Bullseye - Same, but you have to follow him.  Doc Oc - Run in a small circle within in the center of the room while going hit/run.  There's a 2 minute limit, why bother kiting when you risk timing out in stage gimmick that get worst over a period of time (Lasers especially).   Yellow Jacket's specials practically protect him from hits, much less Giant Man's multi-hit break attacks. That's why some characters have higher tiers than others simply because their specials double as a defense and offense that locks down opponents while attacking. Being able to lock-down an opponent by chaining stuns, breaks, flinching is the key to success in zerg boss fights.   Ex:  Captain America = Can't lock down  Winter Soldier = Can do it with multi-hit break moves  Black Cat = Can't lock down  Black Panther = Can with stuns and breakers  Punisher = Just sucks  War Machine = Can lock down with breakers and stuns  Red Skull = Can't lock down  Ghost Rider = Fails at everything.  Also, your character level greatly affects results. You're not going to get the same results fighting a Lv.42 Ronan with severely under leveled/equipped Lv.25s and 30s."

If I do use a 2nd or 3rd hero, it will be mostly as a meatshield for a stage hazard that I couldnt avoid. Reason being that cycling specials with other heroes is not always viable due to stage hazards. For example, assuming you can keep doc ock flinching through a perfect combo from cycling specials, the lasers will jump in at some point sooner or later and  force you to kite and run which will waste dps potential for benched characters. 2 mins is way more than enough time for a single hero to solo kill the boss or do at least 50 to 70% damage when played properly."

FutureFight,3e1w26,Mozia15,4,Tue Jul 21 09:07:11 2015 UTC,Vision and Gamora are considered top tier. Captain America is kinda useless tbh. His skills are rather lackluster and there are better tanks in the game. Hulkbuster and Ronan come to mind. I would suggest to just use Capt to power level (assuming he's one of your highest level) your other characters until you have a better hero to use.
FutureFight,3e1w26,23_stab_wounds,3,Tue Jul 21 12:57:49 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Vision and Gamora are hands down top two in their classes. Captain America, not so much. Captain is a great tank though. Don't get me wrong, but because of his tankiness, he lacks in the offensive category."

I am sorry I don't play the game as often as you or understand everything about it. Having a full time job, family, and actually doing things other than playing a cell phone game are keeping me pretty busy. As I said, I only play from work.

FutureFight,3dyxp1,coju3,7,Mon Jul 20 17:59:50 2015 UTC,yea dr strange is going be a god tier char i bet
FutureFight,3dyxp1,coju3,5,Mon Jul 20 18:02:13 2015 UTC,"I'm betting Enchantress has mind damage, and probably the charm ability that M.O.D.O.K. has immunity to.

FutureFight,3dyxp1,tom641,3,Mon Jul 20 18:07:56 2015 UTC,yea exchantress should be great char for the game

FutureFight,3dyxp1,GodricMaelstrom,-4,Mon Jul 20 18:40:01 2015 UTC,yea universals and combat are the best class's in the game

FutureFight,3dyxp1,mwriteword,2,Mon Jul 20 19:39:32 2015 UTC,YJ and WM are kind of unique.  And WM really isnt that great except when player controlled.  YJ melts face even when on AP.
FutureFight,3dyxp1,tom641,-2,Tue Jul 21 01:13:05 2015 UTC,aww yea i foget about wm and yj but combat and universal are know as very strong class for the game

FutureFight,3dyxp1,StraightFlush172,2,Mon Jul 20 18:40:15 2015 UTC,Both of those were tied to major Marvel movie releases (albeit GotG happened a while ago) while this just seems to be adding characters more organically.
FutureFight,3dyxp1,SageofLogic,5,Mon Jul 20 18:45:53 2015 UTC,this gives me hope that we'll get Moon Knight sooner rather than later.
FutureFight,3dyxp1,SageofLogic,2,Mon Jul 20 18:56:39 2015 UTC,Whenever they're adding people to these marvel games I almost always see hope for Moon Knight so i'd say he's a major contender.
FutureFight,3dyxp1,SageofLogic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:34:47 2015 UTC,moon knight is in marvel heroes and maa so moon knight have a chance to come to mff
FutureFight,3dyxp1,SageofLogic,0,Mon Jul 20 20:13:28 2015 UTC,yea it seem like any chars can come to mff if marvel approve of it i would like to see Dormammu and blackheart to come to the game
FutureFight,3dyxp1,Blitqz21l,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:00:55 2015 UTC,yea i hope sandman does get add to that update too becuse sandman is one them chars i thought fits that game well
FutureFight,3dyxp1,mstheterror,3,Mon Jul 20 18:54:12 2015 UTC,Just two in the universal tab. Who knows how many are in the other tabs.
FutureFight,3dyxp1,MegaMohsi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:44:42 2015 UTC,That's a great point I don't know if everyone else realized.
FutureFight,3dyxp1,OptimusYale,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:54:35 2015 UTC,yea if sandman is coming with that update i can see him as a speed char
FutureFight,3dyxp1,chaoticheartld,2,Mon Jul 20 19:58:45 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I figured he would be combat. But I could see him as a blaster too, with awesome sand-blasting powers."
FutureFight,3dyxp1,BlameReborn,0,Mon Jul 20 20:00:42 2015 UTC,yea sandman is such a perfect fit for mff style of gameplay
FutureFight,3dyxp1,Ben882,2,Mon Jul 20 20:02:00 2015 UTC,They're implementing co-op too so give them a break. Also we already have too much characters and too little ressource to level them so I'm fine with just one or two.
FutureFight,3dyxp1,mmmbobcat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:28 2015 UTC,sandman could be add to the update but 3 or 4 chars a update is perfect

I am really excited about Dr. Strange but making him a Dimension rift characters means a flash sale hunting"
FutureFight,3dyxp1,EchoRespite,2,Mon Jul 20 18:53:32 2015 UTC,"Lets hope they revamp Drifts. Atm, 9-20 energy (+1 for each run) for a CHANCE at getting a bio is ridiculous. If they kept that at 9 energy for each difficulty I'd be fine with that."

FutureFight,3dyxp1,rpmurray7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:05:24 2015 UTC,I can see them doing something like dropping it to 6 energy to be consistent with the rest of the game.  I could also see them putting a 10 per day entry on them to also be consistent with dailys and specials as well.
FutureFight,3dyxp1,Extranationalidad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:08:07 2015 UTC,They need to either drop it to 6 or keep the energy as it is and make is a guaranteed drop.

That's not good for the game to basically blow thru your full bar in about 5 minutes, and then have to wait 7 hours for it to refill..."

FutureFight,3dyxp1,Ben882,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:02:59 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I think Rift should just be free like Villain Siege. But with a daily entry limit.  That would be a clever way to get players too look out for them and check their game more often.
FutureFight,3dyxp1,Zephyraine,0,Tue Jul 21 05:06:53 2015 UTC,yea rifts need a revamp that all
FutureFight,3dyxp1,Ben882,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:29:24 2015 UTC,Well if they're gonna be Rift characters that means there'll potentially be more custom gear
FutureFight,3dyxp1,Zephyraine,0,Tue Jul 21 06:38:34 2015 UTC,"yea sound like that would be a cool idea cent the special missions look like their are only going be used for movie releases or least input Enchantress, Dr. Strange and Sandman into the story some how"

FutureFight,3e0zzb,timmy166,4,Tue Jul 21 03:07:29 2015 UTC,"It's nearly impossible, at least in my experience, to efficiently farm Ronan exclusively using Auto+. I always controlled Ultron twice during the mission to avoid slow fields."

FutureFight,3e0zzb,Blurkillerex,5,Tue Jul 21 03:39:13 2015 UTC,The best one to use for auto is vision. My 5* vision ran everything on auto. The slow fields suck balls but visions dash skill gets him out of them (or in) every time it's up. It all works out.   That was the laziest method I could figure out without needing to touch anything

FutureFight,3e0zzb,Kinrubich,3,Tue Jul 21 03:22:00 2015 UTC,"I actually farm Ronan lv4 on Auto+ when I don't have time.   I use a Malekith lead, and then switch him out right after I start the level to Venom. (Whom Malekith strikes for)  That's the only time I touch my phone, and Malekith's leadership keeps Venom safe from the slow fields."
FutureFight,3e0zzb,imjms737,3,Tue Jul 21 04:55:14 2015 UTC,This was my favourite trick until my Malekith hit lvl 40. Now I'd be wasting two heroes' worth of XP if I wanted to do this. Kind of sucks. :\
FutureFight,3e0zzb,tegeusCromis,2,Tue Jul 21 11:33:08 2015 UTC,"I was able to farm using Ultron by himself in about 1:10, ideally rank 5 to get his last special to make the killing quicker.  Here's a rough idea of what to do (when left on auto):   At the start run past both slow fields into the bottom right corner of the right hand side one and stop when you're in line with the pack of bad guys to your north.  Use beam up towards right hand side of the pack, run towards the center of the remaining guys and use electronic field.  Kill the rest as quickly as possible while avoiding the fields and let autoplay take over till you get to the next set to bad guys. In the next room, autoplay will run you to the next guys and it should do a beam then stomp then a beam and stomp which should take out the guys in that room plus the ones that spawn to the left of the bottom entrance, sometimes 1 survives.  When the next set spawn in, run to the right of the opening and greet the guys that spawn in with a nice electronic field to take them all out at once.  When they die, the guys north of the slow field should spawn, run towards the right side field until it activates, then the left until it does the same then run back down towards the opening and kill them.  When the 5 spawn in at the mouth of that opening, kill them too and let autoplay run you towards the boss room.   When in there, run in between the little gap to the left of the left hand side slow field then go to town on him.   Apologies for the wall of text, it's been a while since I 6*'d him and not had to go back for any reason."

FutureFight,3e0zzb,Lanceuppercut47,2,Tue Jul 21 12:12:09 2015 UTC,Malekith as leader helps the most

FutureFight,3e0fta,risinginthesky,2,Tue Jul 21 01:11:53 2015 UTC,"You could use those as your chapter team but I would recommend your main team to be spidey, venom, and cap marvel since that's what you have now and they get 2 team bonuses.   I would also level ultron in the side as he is a very decent character to have and he's very farmable in special missions right now.  For ISO-8 I would wait until you're level 40 and reroll for a set because those re rolls can get very expensive. I would just stick 2* ISO-8 that match your current set bonus for now.  Gear for spidey should focus on physical attack, all defense, and dodge. For venom physical attack, physical defense, hp, and defense penetration. Cap marvel enery attack, all defense, and hp.   Special items I would definitely give spidey and marvel dodge gear. For venom you could do dodge as well or something like crit rate since his basic atk hits hard as it is or ignore dodge for people with dodge in arena."
FutureFight,3e0fta,Kinrubich,2,Tue Jul 21 01:41:34 2015 UTC,"Might as well try to get at least a 3* vision or a giantman.  they are good at clearing missions. one thing i regret is i leveled loki, malekith and thor first to 40 (which are not PVE characters). for me, if i would start again, i would start with vision and ultron, as well as ronan."

FutureFight,3dxudv,dearbluey,2,Mon Jul 20 13:23:13 2015 UTC,"Sure, but that's part of what makes something ""hard"". Something being easy/hard doesn't necessarily mean that it's physically challenging, it could just mean that it takes a really long time to do.  For example, making beer isn't hard at all. Humans have been doing it for thousands of years. However, it takes 45 days .. So if you screw something up, you don't know for 45 days. Hence, it's harder to brew beer than it is to cook a 3 course meal. Sure, the prep time is the same, but the payoff is delayed."
FutureFight,3dxudv,palmermarc,2,Mon Jul 20 13:53:53 2015 UTC,"I only have one level 5 (although Giant Man and Vision will be there in less than a week), but I got him up to 45 in about two weeks running level 40 special missions - which had the added side benefit of levelling everyone else up to 30 (besides Angela, who I don't have, and Doc Ock and Blade, who I'm keeping at 20 so I can rack up some revenge candidates in Arena)."

YJ's offense is so awesome that you don't necessarily need a major boost to be competitive - the defense could do it just as well. Damage mitigation is important in the upper elite missions.

Do not use venom's, it's terrible- only consider it when 5 or 6 star mastery.  Ultron,vision,wm- definitely ultron. All attack means both energy and physical, which is better than wm's which only boosts physical attack. Vision's is good, but attack> super armor as attack is permanent.  Thorns of thor- Malekith's is the only good one. Destroyer's is very situational (only against energy damage-dealing enemies)  General rule- Use a leadership that boosts and benefits at least two members in the team."

This is true here because Ultron and Vision both run off their energy attack stat (and hence would get no buff from WM's leadership), but it may not be true in other teams. You probably know this, but it's worth stating for the benefit of others, who may be operating under mistaken assumptions re: the relationship between attack type and damage type."

She's limited (generally) to 3 per day, with the occasional 6, but at least with her you know you'll always have that.  So while her bios are a bit restricted, she's a steady gainer and energy-free.  Contrast to, say, War Machine where RNG could give me 0-6, usually on the lower end, at 6 energy per attempt.  She's also a shifter, so occasionally that'll speed it up a bit."

So how is that different from a guaranteed 3 bios every other day, then 6 every other day.  Arguably it's much easier to farm Starlord because you can get a guaranteed 9 per day as long as you can beat vs9.  Much much much better than farming elites for possible bio drops"

In your case 6 elites for Ultron and 6 for Vision as well as whichever many Special missions. And can just invest the energy (around 100 maybe) on some other character or gear/debris runs you couldn't do before.

FutureFight,3dxwjn,EchoRespite,5,Mon Jul 20 13:03:20 2015 UTC,I've found the easiest way to work out what damage for rerolls is to look at the initial damage type given on your weapon before you even start upgrading.  It will be in orange (Yellow?) and that's the one you should probably be aiming for on all rerolls. You kinda maybe sorta need to link the website if you want to show us. ;)

This may sound a little dramatic, but it seems you are already beaten in your mind before you even begin to fight Ock. You need to view him as beatable (which he is--very beatable) if you want to stand a chance.

Venom/Ultron have WAY too long animations for that fight. Ultron's laser, the 5 star move and jump & lasers skills are very dangerous to use against him. If I've had Vision/YJ at that point I probably would be able to beat him but my best heroes aren't really suited for that fight :P"
FutureFight,3dxut5,Gpaint,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:32:41 2015 UTC,"I'm very sorry to say this, but you are doing something wrong. I just beat today's Doc Ock with 5* Ultron (lvl 42) and Ronan (lvl 44) used individually. I didn't read this earlier, or I'd have used Venom to see how he did. I'll try him out next time I see Ock 9.  (Edited to add some more specific points)  Ultron's skills are not dangerous against Ock unless you get greedy. Stomp into skill 3 is very quick. Beam should be used like any beam: when you are sure it's safe, usually right after a laser has fired. Skill 4 is the most unsafe against Ock; I rarely use it.  It's true that Vision and YJ are a lot safer, but they (and Malekith) are exceptional Ock-slayers. You do not need that level of safety/power to take him on. Perhaps it is because you are too used to that level of safety that you end up failing with other heroes. You have to accept that they are really vulnerable and play with the appropriate level of caution. It's like a Dark Souls boss fight, though much easier."

Sometimes lag is terrible on my phone so this has worked well for me when needed on any stage."

FutureFight,3dxut5,tegeusCromis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:41:14 2015 UTC,Mhmm that's what I'm referring to. They usually Insta fire for me alot and I've found I can do it with half as many heroes if I just play very aggressive. Depending on who you're using it shouldn't be terribly difficult to avoid the first 3 lasers but after that it gets stupid. My thinking is if lasers insta kill you then I'm less concerned with losing hp at the onset of the fight.

FutureFight,3dvx2h,Zyraz-,3,Mon Jul 20 06:06:16 2015 UTC,Rank>Mastery>Gear>EXP Levels>Skills>ISO  That is the general rule of thumb with some exceptions that would take too long to get into.  Work on the gear of your core team as much as possible as you keep leveling them up making sure the options you get on them are consistent with what the character needs as in Energy/all attack for energy damage heroes.  Upgrading skills are only gold efficient at lower levels and more so if each level gives +13/14 extra damage since the percent damage that each skill starts with doesn't change.  Don't worry about ISO beyond putting 3 iso that active the set bonus that each character starts with if you are really struggling.

FutureFight,3dvq87,lars_attack,6,Sun Jul 19 22:48:16 2015 UTC,Rifts are a cool mechanic but they really need to lower the energy costs or increase the drop rates. It was fine when the game launched and it was a cool special event you looked forward to even if they were overpriced. Updates have really highlighted what a terrible value rifts are for the energy you put into them and removed any specialness they had with the flash sales.

Use fodder on the earlier ones. Of course, this means your fodder must be fairly strong.  If it helps, I use equal-level 3-stars on the first four stages.

FutureFight,3duylf,daman12457,4,Sun Jul 19 20:03:48 2015 UTC,"You have enough 40's to get past vs8, IMO, depending on the heroes.  It probably depends on 2 factors, how you use the 40's you have and what level are the rest of your heroes.  So I'd definitely recommend bringing the lower end of your entire team.    For example, what I did was use special missions.  Take my 45/5/5 and 2 lower end heroes, esp ones that I wanted to play around with and get to 40, and run thru an entire unlimited run, with a 45, you should easily be able to tier 4, and again, depending on hero, you might be able to run tier 5 in the non-unlimited portion.  That will really help leveling your heroes.  Doing it this way, I've gotten all my heroes to 30+ and around 10+ level 40's and 4 5's, with a soon to be 6 probably tomorrow.  Then the 1st 3 stages should be cake and done with 1-2 heroes, usually your 1 and 2*'s.  tier 4 shouldn't be too difficult either, as the boss is lvl 32.  Outside that, just the basic strategies of knowing what boss does what and what heroes are better against which bosses.  IE only physical damage dealers against Destroyer, or special heroes like Malekith being immune to slow and as thus the best Bullseye killer in the game."

I also find that sometimes using 2 heroes (rather than a full team or solo, so you can still get a 2 character team bonus) is helpful. Also, for example, against destroyer, tagging out almost instantly stops the meteor rain."
FutureFight,3duylf,TrackXII,3,Sun Jul 19 20:10:12 2015 UTC,For reference I used a lot of my ungeared 2*s that I've leveled to 25-30 to clear the early stages by chipping them away.  With only about 6 characters at 40/3* I'm currently able to regularly clear stage 6 and I feel like my Vision would have a shot at 7 if he didn't have to mop up the last bit of 6 every time.

Are you taking advantage of Ock's and Bullseye's weakness to Blasters? Who are your 4 star characters? Are they all mastered?  I've been using one 40/4/4 character to beat 6 for quite a while now.  Ideally I'd use 1-2 for 7 and 2-3 for 8, but Doc Ock and Bullseye usually screw that up. I actually beat VS 6 Destroyer today with 40/3/1 Black Panther. So I'm really just throwing a bunch of stuff out there in hopes of figuring out where the difference between our characters is. I think 1-8 are pretty beatable with enough 4 star characters, it's 9 where 5/6 star characters shine the most."
FutureFight,3duylf,Blitqz21l,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:35:02 2015 UTC,"If you run the daily missions consistently, meaning all 10, you'll likely have a huge back up of 1* ISO's.  With those, I just equip them on all my under 40 heroes with the basic set bonus that is given to them.  It's not much, but it does help.  I don't reroll the set bonus until 40 as it seems pointless to do otherwise and wastes a lot of gold.  Gear, I try to go at min, 5/5/5/5 because that's just gear kits and those are easy to get."
FutureFight,3duylf,Augmentedforth,2,Mon Jul 20 00:11:37 2015 UTC,"I was able to finally beat the last stage of VS a couple days ago. It's just a matter of which VS variant I'm facing though. I still can't beat it when Bullseye is stage 9.   I start using my level 40's at the earliest, stage 6. It takes me about 4 or 5 level 40's to beat stage 9, also depending on who the boss is. For stages 1 - 5, you can use characters who are two, maybe three levels below the bosses level. I try to not use a character who has a higher level than the boss, that way I ensure I'm saving my highest characters for the harder levels."

FutureFight,3duylf,CountHalphas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:48:23 2015 UTC,"I did finished my first lv 9 using 8 lv 40 (only 3 on full mastery) and a bunch of lv 15-30s. Some pointers that I think might help:   You need blasters, obviously. I tried to get all my blasters to at least lv 30 asap. Back then there were only 6 blasters, and I had 5 (Malekith were so hard to get without flash sales and shifters). Vision, Malekith, YJ should be leveled up to max first as they are the best boss killers, followed with Starlord and WM. Save your lv 40s until at least lv 5 VS or above. If you have 4 decent lv 30s, you can solo the first 4 bosses. My suggestion is 2 of Ironman/Wasp/Redskull for the combat bosses, Gamora/Sharon Carter for Destroyer, and Loki/Daredevil for Ronan. Goblin will be very useful as well. Use only 1 hero per entry. Just kite. Dont overuse your high level heroes, and dont waste your lower level heroes as they can be used for fodders in the later levels. Long range kiters like Hawkeye, Yondu, Bullseye, Loki, Punisher can be useful too to scrape off a few percent of high level bosses. Get them to lv 30 and just keep kiting. Use the fodders for later stages. The sucky melee heroes (Blade, Iron Fist, etc) can take off 1% each, while the long range kiters should be able to take 3-5% each (depending on which stages). Remember they always round down the boss health (if you deal 1 damage, it will still be counted as 1% for the next round).   Btw, which heroes of yours are lv 40 and 45? Maybe I can help more if I know your roster."

Sometimes I pair my level 36 ★★★ Giant Man with Gamora when fighting a high level Destroyer just to be safe. I usually plan first who to put up against with before starting my run. Fodders first, I usually assign a big damage dealer against Bullseye because the longer you fight him the more robots there are. The stage where I am most cautious of is the Doctor Octopus stages, damn lasers. So I usually assign characters who have a high mobility against him."
FutureFight,3dvp1r,dann511,2,Sun Jul 19 22:38:30 2015 UTC,Much more similar to Cap's shield throw but it does much more damage. It also bounces back to its targets (idk if shield throw does this too). Animation is also pretty cool. I have no regrets with my 5* Star-lord.
FutureFight,3dvp1r,carbondusk,2,Mon Jul 20 02:05:57 2015 UTC,"He's on my second team, so while I put gold into him, I don't study him the way I do Cap's Crew. It bounces around a lot like cap's shield throw. I do think that it hits way more targets, almost to the point that it'll hit every target available if there are that many around. But if it's just one, it'll hit them 4/5 times and stop. Whereas groups it'll hit well over 5 (sometimes into the 10+ range).   I've even seen it bounce well out of range to continue hitting existing enemies. I feel like once there's a certain number of guys, it switched from hitting 6 times to hitting everyone once. But EVERYONE once. It just matters whether or not they're on the map.   I think starlord's persona is represented very well by his skill set. He offers a wide range of tactics that may not be amazing against everyone, but they'll always be usefull somewhere."

The only character I can see being added with this Secret Wars update is Doctor Strange, with possible skins being added for Iron-man(the slick armor one from the post-secret wars image thing) and the black suit for Daredevil.

FutureFight,3duwfd,BrainWav,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:16:08 2015 UTC,"This. It's not that they can't, it's that they actively don't want to. Look at the way the comics have shifted in the last couple years. FF is no longer an ongoing title. The Inhumans are largely taking the place the mutants occupied in the comics for decades. They killed off Wolverine. Marvel Comics is really just a marketing/advertising/House of Ideas branch for Marvel Studios. Marvel/Disney/The Powers That Be are using the comics to keep characters constantly in the public eye - as long as people are reading the comics, there'll be some discussion about them. They're also using the comics as a way to farm for inspiration in the films - Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Civil War are all recent comics that have been/are being adapted. The scale of the economics involved in comics (millions) vs. movies (billions) relegates the comics to second fiddle position.   Anyway, this is a long way of saying that Marvel is actively downplaying the characters they can't make movies of for two reasons. 1) Put the characters they CAN make movies of front and center. 2) Keep the other characters quiet/in the background so as to not help the competition. I'm sure the eventual goal is that Fox loses a ton of money on its Marvel movies and gives the rights back to Marvel in some deal."

I'm hesitant of having them in this kind of game. Not that they wouldn't fit - they would - it's just their abilities are so similar to Peter's...  But if they do, they have plenty to work from. Gwen is inexperienced and Silk is far more acrobatic in her fighting. Superior Spider-Man could even pass as a Blaster/Speed hybrid type. (Speed with Energy attacks?)  Doom we probably won't see and Strange is probably going to wait until his movie, or else we'll get a movie skin later.  Thing with Thanos is they'd NEED to make him OP.

Early on she's a great boss killer. In the standard trio I usually used Cap America and IM to tag team the mobs, then switch to BW to finish off the boss. She's a natural kiter and her lightning skill tracks enemies, making it easier to catch even the most agile bosses.  In the mid game she loses her shine as other characters get unlocked. Many of those shine bright then fade away. Part of her losing her lustre is her 3rd skill that is less useful when you want to get the story part of the game over and done with and ""need to power through those levels"". :-) After all, during that stage of the game you want someone that dishes out massive amounts of damage as quickly as possible, so 3 attack skills far outweigh 2 attack skills and a defence skill. This is the part where you need to persevere: she more than redeems herself in the late game.  In the late game, with her 5* skill unlocked, her defence skill (3*) becomes a blessing. (And that was before the dodge special came out.) Add dodge special gear, gear her up with extra HP and add any of the following ISO sets that boosts her already great capabilities:   The Sly One Animal Instinct Silent Night Manipulate Density Huntress of Heven   Yes, she's very versatile. The ISO set will largely define how you're going to play her to maximise her advantages and minimise the disadvantages.  Don't be fooled by her lack of popularity, she is a (very underrated) beast. If you need a blaster killer, she's the one to use."
FutureFight,3dvint,Pan_Demic,2,Mon Jul 20 00:59:03 2015 UTC,Oh damn! GREAT EXPLANATION! Thank you for your thoughts.
FutureFight,3dvint,Zyraz-,2,Mon Jul 20 03:42:08 2015 UTC,I took a different route with her ISO and stuck Binary Power on her... This is mostly because I usually run her in a team with Captain America which boosts her HP 30%. I use the HP shield to take advantage of that and it makes a big difference in survivability. I like to mix it up and not solely rely on her Dodge.  Also her 6* skill is probably the best skill in the game right now. It will 1 shot any group of enemies in this game and has a range which covers basically everything you can see on the screen. It will also 1-shot the squishier heroes in arena.
FutureFight,3dvint,Malthan01,2,Mon Jul 20 06:01:32 2015 UTC,"This post seems pretty spot on, one thing to add. I have her at 6 stars and her new ability coup is a safe gap closer that does massive damage in a huge aoe and finches everyone. Like pan mentioned her 5 star is strong but kinda goes against her kit as most of her abilities are ranged then you have this in your face ability that can hurt you.  Coup fixes this  It will allow you to safe engage, use systema, THEN you can use guns and widows bite to establish range and safety. Tbh this seems like one of the strongest setup rotations in the game right now next to iron patriots stun to ranged abilities. In short I cannot reccomend her enough  Tldr 6 star ability is a REAL game changer for her."
FutureFight,3dvint,exaslave,4,Mon Jul 20 08:11:13 2015 UTC,"She's a very good kite style character. Easy to farm (3 early elite missions and appears as ally shifter) and she's one of the starting characters so it's likely you were working on her at some point anyway. Easy to see why people keep working on her.  She is very useful on VS despite being a speed character (usually just disadvantages for speed characters on VS), very good against doc ock and ronan for example. Has 2 attacks that can stop enemies from attacking for quite a few seconds. One of the only 2 characters (so far) with a 6* skill. Just... lots of reasons."
FutureFight,3dvint,Augmentedforth,2,Mon Jul 20 00:25:43 2015 UTC,"When I get her to level 40, I'm going to roll for ""The Sly One"" That ISO set ups HP, dodge, all defense, & attack speed. Sure, you can go for an offensive ISO set, but I think she's more fitted for counter attacking."
FutureFight,3dvint,tegeusCromis,3,Sun Jul 19 21:48:03 2015 UTC,"It has a crap proc, though. And attack speed is just a bad stat.  Also not too sure what you mean by ""counter attacking"". Could you elaborate? As far as I can tell, she's a kiter pure and simple. Zap, shoot, run until you can zap again."
FutureFight,3dvint,Augmentedforth,2,Sun Jul 19 21:56:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's pretty much what I mean for counter attacking. After kitting them around and having them use up attacks. That's when you attack. And yes, I do agree attack speed is a bad stat. Another suggestion would be ""Animal Instinct"" or ""Manipulate Density"" since instead of attack speed, it's critical damage for both and you get a shield for the active ratio and all defense respectively."
FutureFight,3dvint,YanHoek,3,Sun Jul 19 22:33:46 2015 UTC,"True, All of those stats seem really helpful for the type of character she is."
FutureFight,3dvint,dearbluey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:56:18 2015 UTC,I've got Animal Instinct on her but she's not at 40 yet so it hasn't kicked in. Even so at 4* she pretty much dumps on the rest of my roster. She really is good.  Remember to whack a lightning generator on her too!
FutureFight,3dvint,skyzvengeance,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:57:43 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about the lightning - I have dodge on her right now, but I see the 6-star opens up a second lightning-based skill.  Is it worth it to go that way early?"
FutureFight,3dvint,TrackXII,2,Sun Jul 19 23:06:22 2015 UTC,Her 5 star skill is physical damage for the first two leg swipes then lightning damage for the end blast which does the most damage so she really has 3 lightning dmg skills.  I would keep the dodge gear on her if you have the uniform until she is 6 stars to maximize the benefit.
FutureFight,3duo9b,ShoLad,3,Sun Jul 19 17:27:26 2015 UTC,"I like Bloodthirst on him. Although he seems pretty safe, he does still take hits while doing his combo, mainly during his 3* skill. Wouldn't mind an attack boost set, either, if using a crit gear."
FutureFight,3duo9b,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:23:33 2015 UTC,How does his 4th move even look like? I am very curious and I have been stuck at 3* BP for a very very long time...  I rolled Ultron's Hatred and it seems to be a good one actually.
FutureFight,3duo9b,BobbySmithGang,2,Sun Jul 19 18:20:15 2015 UTC,His 4th move is some kinda fast pace bouncing where you see these claw marks appear on your screen. Some team-attacks let him use the skill (I believe when he's teamed with Daredevil).  Ontopic: I've been using Power of Symbiote on mine. His fast attacks allow him to proc it quite often. And the stats it gives are all useful to him

FutureFight,3dufkc,exaslave,2,Sun Jul 19 19:33:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, i did not realise that it had two effects, i always assumed it is just an overall slowdown and hence his attack/movement is slowed down. ugh, that's sad.   So is there no way to nullify the attack speed slow?"
FutureFight,3dufkc,crash100200,2,Mon Jul 20 03:04:48 2015 UTC,Hmm.. interesting. The bug with this was fixed in ronan stages in VS with the last update. You should send a ticket about this :)
FutureFight,3dufkc,primakov,2,Sun Jul 19 17:10:35 2015 UTC,"In my experience it works with bullseye in vs, and with the slowing fields too, but when you use a skill in slowing field, you get slowed. I can't imagine that this is not a bug"

So if I am playing a Spider-Man in arena and that other person has completely decked out their Spider-Man with movement speed than my character won't be affected by it.

Edit: I'm wrong."

FutureFight,3dufkc,Drugs_and_Hugs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:01:47 2015 UTC,Well I guess it would be that either A) the gear is broken (which I doubt because the gears were released some time ago and a fix would have been in by now). Or B) it does something different than resists movement speed as it relates to slow domes in Ronan's special or in the Bullseye villain siege for example.
FutureFight,3dufkc,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:04:51 2015 UTC,"I think the other comments on this thread are right: it does reduce the slow, but not completely. So the ""immune"" notice is inaccurate."

To keep things balanced the number of bios or entrance to the mode could be appropriately limited.  I would also like the introduction of an item (that doesn't require farming) that would allow a player to specifically choose a specific reward from a 'normal' mission, rather than always being subject to RNG.

FutureFight,3du0su,Il_Palazzo,3,Sun Jul 19 13:34:37 2015 UTC,I dont mind those flash sales. It only bothers people who only want bios. I see it as an efficent way to get new players spending crystals on leveling up their characters asap. Then spend money to buy bios when theyre out of free crystals.
FutureFight,3du0su,Pokeiality,3,Sun Jul 19 16:16:31 2015 UTC,"I understand asking them to remove the XP chips and/or clear tickets, but you're asking them to remove everything that's not bios. Poor idea. Even having 2 separate sales is a poor idea. You can't make things too easy to get, nor is it really needed considering most characters are readily farmable.  Why ask for buffs for characters like Cap Marvel, IM, and HB when there are a number of characters who are far worse off? Not everyone is going to get a good passive just like not every character will have a good leadership nor will all skills be that good nor will every character have good team bonuses, etc..."

FutureFight,3du0su,ssj4ric,2,Mon Jul 20 02:15:21 2015 UTC,"Heh if you want an easy game, try Candy Crush. I havent played it myself, but since my Grandma can play it I assume it is easy enough. Maybe that will be more suited to your moaning.   If you make it much easier to get bios by removing the other flash sales, the gap between F2P and P2W will be enormous, and will deter new players. Just look at how Heroes of Dragon Age has progressed. Awful. F2P players who have been playing forever cant even touch relatively newer P2W players in PvP. ISO set rolls are expensive, and they should be. It is meant to be an end game upgrade. If there are too much to focus on in the early stage of the game, it will be very confusing for new players. Older heroes are weak. Of course they are. It is how any game in the world works. New heroes are made interesting and strong so that people will try to get them and keep playing. If new heroes are just the same, why bother getting them? Yes, some might need a bit of a buff to remain viable, but don't expect the buff to be released so close to a new hero release.   This game, imo, is one of the better designed game in the market. It is challenging enough for many players, but not too easy that it becomes boring. It does not deter F2P players, but is also rewarding enough for P2W players. Some missions costs too much energy, sure, but that means you just have to manage your energy spending properly. The game is not perfect, yes. There are still some bugs, and performance issues with some devices. And maybe there is a need for further progression for high level players. But so far, NM has done what they can, fixing bugs and releasing new content regularly."
FutureFight,3du0su,agent_patrick_star,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:15:57 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of purists liking the game ""hard"". Well, it is not. After a bit of farming you can top every content in the game except for arena because it's a paywall but the top 1% is easy enough, and I can do VS9 just fine thank you.  Instead the usual ""wales"" will just get their maxed 6* asap with the power of money, taking the max advantage from those norn stones and dimensional debris from sales they will not even bother to farm anymore. Because there are 2 main samples of players that will buy anything other than biometrics or at worst energy with crystals: those who spend a ton, and those new to the game that will come to regret it later. I guess that the others -you, from the feedback I get here- just enjoy refreshing and are not bothered at all of the junk they find. I kinda envy your patience.  This game is awesome for some aspects that you all know, but annoying for others.   To make some examples: you will have most of the times decide if to play your favourite ""team loser"", or play your god tier ""I don't care about these heroes stories but they wreck in game"". Characters are unbalanced between elite, ""almost but not quite"" and ghetto heroes, skills are unbalanced robbing the sense of achievement for a hard earned upgrade. The achievement system in the ""quest"" part is underwelming, and in the iso8 compartment plainly annoying. Is it really bad to ask to polish stuff like this to make the game more awesome?  Anyway, these are just my personal opinions of course. Please understand that I have a terrible personality and be not bothered too much"
FutureFight,3du0su,Jplato09,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying... But I have to disagree. Flash sales without norn stones and such would make for a terribly easy game for anyone who's willing to throw money in. Also, there are a lot of people that actually like the Debris sales and the norn stone sales, because debris are a energy sink and norn stones are hard and slow to get, so people take the shortcut. Not a lot of people, but some. And then, with those sales, you have to check every 1/2 hour to see if you have that one sale you've been waiting for for a long time. All the rest... I just don't agree."

It seems like during certain circumstances if an attack skill goes off before the enemy is fully phased in, or finishes a animation no damage will be taken nor any damage text. It doesn't happen much but I've see it enough to make a guess. It really doesn't affect anything in the long run, just think of it as the game code dodges the attack."

At higher levels the leadership bonuses start being more important than the team bonuses as well. In addition in the arena your opponent is computer controlled and has several other disadvantages, so it's not uncommon to wipe the floor with your opponent while using only one character. In VS the general tendency is to go with one char at a time, so no team at all. Also the entire Story mode isn't much of a challenge once you hit a certain level (though initial progression is very slow).  In the end just play what you like most, and have an eye on how easy/hard it is to come by the bios of your primary characters. If they happen to have good team/striker/leadership synergy that's good, if not, so be it."

Captain Marvel suffers from the fact that she comes out strong and just dies off as other heroes start to shine when you get higher levels.

Defense Penetration      I feel like Defense Penetration is more consistent that critical rate because you basically have additional damage on every attack compared than with just 20% or so additional damage you get from critical rate which is just by chance.

FutureFight,3dtanh,coju3,2,Sun Jul 19 06:32:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I'm trying to confirm that his passive procs when enlarging, which is practically all of his specials, correct?"
FutureFight,3dtanh,coju3,3,Sun Jul 19 07:39:53 2015 UTC,"no, his passive is his rank 4 skill, so the suit won't do anything until rank 4 other than the base 10%+ to all attack and all defense that all uniforms provide. Once you hit rank 4 you unlock his passive ability, which procs on his attacks at a 25% rate. It doesn't have to be a skill attack, it could be a basic attack. All of his attacks hit as an ae, so it pretty much takes effect as soon as the cooldown is off no matter what. So yes and no; yes all of his specials can cause it to go off, but only because they are attacks, not because they are making him use ""a ENLARGE buff"" as the uniform says. The only source of the enlarge buff is his passive proccing, which happens 25% of the time off of any attack."

It's a risk/reward thing.  Falcon's would benefit a all Speed character team more, due to the fact they usually attack faster and thus would proc the dodge more often."
FutureFight,3dsq6b,hohndo,5,Sun Jul 19 02:44:47 2015 UTC,You want to depend on chance when dodge is already a heavily luck-based stat? Go for Spider-man. Falcon leadership is terrible.
FutureFight,3dsq6b,EdgarDom81539,4,Sun Jul 19 05:02:08 2015 UTC,Dodge is a stat that already depends heavily on probability; one that procs on chance is not a good boost. It's not really a significant increase so i'd go with spidey's since its permanence doesnt require you to keep hoping that it procs or else you don't have dodge.

FutureFight,3dsq6b,Gpaint,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:38:51 2015 UTC,"Spider-Man's leadership provides a permanent increase to the dodge stat while he is the team leader, Falcon's gives a temporary boost at a 5% rate while attacking. This temporary boost lasts for 5 seconds that has a 1 second cool down meaning when it activates for 1 second it I'll not activate again. With Falcon its possible you could get a larger stat boost, but it won't be active 100% of the time. As for which is better that is a tough call. When using characters who have multihit skills they have a better chance of the dodge activating, but on a character that has single hit skills it may not activate often negating is usefulness."

The only time you'd ever use Bullseye's leadership is if you're against Spiderman in the arena  3) As a combat hero, he has a lot of hp, and he's ranged as well, giving you the ability to kite. You don't really get much out of him at 3* since he just gets a dodge buff skill, but the his 4* passive is always useful. Haven't gotten him to 5* to give a good review of him just yet though."

FutureFight,3dt7q2,RaskolnikovsAxe,3,Sun Jul 19 05:43:16 2015 UTC,"Some skills scale off physical attack but deal energy damage. E.g. warmachine's repulsor shot, which derives damage from physical attack but the damage dealt is energy type. The type of damage doesnt scale off energy attack, but is simply just the TYPE of the damage dealt. Likewise for vision's density shift, which scales damage from energy attack but deals physical damage. What is the function of the TYPE of the damage dealt then? For example, captain marvel's passive is a reflective shield that only works on energy attacks. Warmachine's repulsor shot would be reflected, because it is an energy type attack, and vision's density shift would not, because its a physical type attack. Same goes for thor's lightning type damage, ghost rider's fire damage, and goblin's poison etc etc. Yes, they do."

FutureFight,3dt7q2,chaoticheartld,3,Sun Jul 19 06:43:04 2015 UTC,"First, this is a pretty common misconception. Physical/Energy ATTACK and Physical/Energy DAMAGE are two different things. People see a character's skills say they do ""Physical"" damage and another says it does ""Energy"" damage, and they get confused on what ATTACK score to bring up. Both will use the same ATTACK score, but do different DAMAGE types.  For instance, if you look at the skill, it will typically say something like ""Physical Attack 47% Energy Damage"". What that means is the skill does Energy DAMAGE, but to calculate how much that damage is, it uses 47% of your Physical ATTACK score. Thus, it is your Physical ATTACK you want to bring up with skills/ISOS/etc.  EVERY character only uses ONE Attack score. Even if they do more than one Damage Type (and there are several damage types ranging from physical, energy, fire, mind, cold, etc), it is ALWAYS calculated from one Attack score.   Your basic attacks will calculate from that same score as well. So, to  answer your question, you only need to focus on the one Attack Score that particular character uses. All Attack bonuses are no more useful than getting an Attack bonus for the right type for that character.  To answer your second question, yes, when you combine two ISOs it basically rolls a random new higher * ISO of the same color. This can REALLY mess you up when combining Chaotic ISOs, as the bonuses for the new ISO could be anything."
FutureFight,3dt7q2,eak125,3,Sun Jul 19 06:14:31 2015 UTC,"To make it simple:  Look in the team menu and see which stat shows under your level.  If it's energy attack, level that.  If Physical, level that.  FF has the most convoluted ways of describing skills and abilities but if you focus on that main stat you will always increase your damage.  On a side note, make sure that your gear is correct for your attack type.  Use Change option to fix any incorrect gear though it's random so you may pay several times before you fix your gear."
FutureFight,3dt7q2,tegeusCromis,2,Sun Jul 19 10:18:21 2015 UTC,"You just need to boost the stat the skills draw on, regardless of the damage type they deal. So if you see ""Physical attack 90% energy damage"", boost your physical attack, not your energy attack. See this thread, among others."

FutureFight,3dr3cq,kboutin1,2,Sat Jul 18 17:19:39 2015 UTC,"If you intend to keep playing Cap A, I would max him and get him to +10, get a team bonus with him and go through some normal missions. Skills to level 20.  As to cash, I would go with waiting until you see either a flash sale you really want or just save it until you're more experienced in the game."
FutureFight,3dr3cq,Jplato09,2,Sat Jul 18 17:24:55 2015 UTC,"Real cash, or Gold?  Captain America is decent, but max his skills out at 15 or so. Don't push it much further than that. Jplato has a pretty good idea going.  If he's your favorite, or main, I'd invest in his costume. Damage immunity is a beast, but wait until you earn it through daily 25 and weekly Arena prizes."

FutureFight,3dr3cq,tegeusCromis,2,Sat Jul 18 17:37:10 2015 UTC,"Gear is more important (once you bring skills to, say, 10), but don't over-upgrade a character you're not sure will stay your main. The truth is it's materials, not gold, which limit your gear upgrades in the long run. Some of those materials may seem plentiful now--which is probably why you feel it's gold that's limiting you--but this will not be the case once you start building a stronger overall roster for VS purposes."

FutureFight,3driio,Pedruska,3,Sat Jul 18 19:29:46 2015 UTC,Ultron's hatred should further boost his attacks. You can chain his skills nicely and he attacks so fast the enemy doesnt even have time to react or hit back so i think a shield effect would be wasted on him. Dodge custom gear should be more than enough to increase survivability :)
FutureFight,3driio,crash100200,3,Sat Jul 18 19:36:14 2015 UTC,I intentionally went with animal instinct. He's already bringing the pain early on so I didn't feel I need to boost that but adding more dodge along with a booster and he becomes even more of a nightmare
FutureFight,3driio,Gpaint,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:51:54 2015 UTC,"I unintentionally went with animal instinct (first 6 slot ISO 8 set I rolled) and it's been working great. For now I have fitted him with some crit gear cause it was the only one I had at the time (what rift gives the dodge boost again?). And it works pretty good. With his multiple hit attacks, there's a good chance he'll crit. I manage to survive just fine with ~10% dodge and 6.7k hp"
FutureFight,3driio,andaleo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:07:02 2015 UTC,It's not really a HUGE deal if you go crit or dodge (iron fist rift). The dodge scales so well that I see a noticeable decrease in damage taken in game modes. I think dodge or crit is a good choice
FutureFight,3driio,Gpaint,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:57:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's IF's rift for the dodge, it that or Hawkeye, I get the two mixed up but I think Hawkeye is the ignore."

FutureFight,3driio,bobsponge933,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:16:20 2015 UTC,I choose skill cooldown because his basic attacks sucks and I have to rely on his skill to survive and be powerful.
FutureFight,3driio,tegeusCromis,3,Sat Jul 18 19:39:24 2015 UTC,"His basic attack only sucks in comparison to his amazing skills.  Personally, I find the downtime between rotations to be low enough not to need further reduction. And this is before adding the 5* skill to the mix."

FutureFight,3driio,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:53:07 2015 UTC,"Sure, but he has no bad skills, so you'll certainly be using the full chain. If you go Now You See Me --> Flying Barrage --> Stinger, there's roughly a 4-second delay before you can start the chain again. How long a delay are you getting with your ISOs? If it's 2 seconds, maybe that's worth it. If it's 3, meh.  And that's before getting the 5* skill."
FutureFight,3driio,dann511,2,Sat Jul 18 20:04:37 2015 UTC,"Hm. Interesting combo. In villain siege I usually use Stinger > Now you see me > Flying Barrage , wait roughtly 0.5 sec (or if he gets a paralyze just trow in 2 autos in between skills and ignore this 0.5 wait) and Stinger again. Now you see me should be up in 3 sec and then just chain your skills as they come out of cooldown. You should try it. Its pretty safe."

Now that I can't easily level up any of my regulars anymore, I spend lots of time in the Special missions trying to farm bios.  I understand how great it is to add content for the long-time players, but Netmarble could definitely give some help to people in the mid-game grind..."
FutureFight,3dqdab,Hogs-o-War,0,Sat Jul 18 16:11:13 2015 UTC,For me yellowjacket is not an overall character. Yes he deals alot of damage but he cant take a lot of damage. You cant use yellowjacket on auto.

Yellow Jacket is easily the best blaster or at least gives Vision a run for his money for best character overall.   I have mines at 4 star and his Leadership and invincibility frames for 2 of his skills are insane. In Arena, my level 40 Rank 4 Yellow Jacket beat a fully mastered ranked 5 Ronan/Vision/Ultron team by himself. His leadership allows him to paralyze foes for 3 seconds. It may not sound like a lot but its enough time to dish out 30-40% HP damage.  In Villain Siege, he just destroys every stage not Destroyer, even the last one"

(5* -max lvl 50, 6* -max lvl 60, apparently the files are already in game, just not implemented yet) And then just keep focusing on the ones you like cuz again, 10 levels and a rank up is A LOT.   Oh, and a single good 6* can solo a full team of 5* in arena."
FutureFight,3dr5xs,tegeusCromis,2,Sat Jul 18 18:57:49 2015 UTC,Well I think I'll follow your advice afterall. I'll get my Antman and YJ to 5 since they're so close and work on giantman afterwards. Thank you!

FutureFight,3dr5xs,tegeusCromis,2,Sat Jul 18 17:45:09 2015 UTC,"I'm saying it because going for a 6 star would take a lot of my energy, that I could spend getting other 5 stars."
FutureFight,3dr5xs,tegeusCromis,2,Sat Jul 18 17:56:51 2015 UTC,"I think 6 star can wait. I feel it's more beneficial to have more 5 star characters than having 1 single 6* character. Right now, there's no big advantage to it, except for stats boost/ISO. (exception to Spidey & BW)"
FutureFight,3dr5xs,yamiprem,2,Sat Jul 18 17:59:40 2015 UTC,"That's probably what I'm going for. If I want to, getting a 6 star from the Specials is a bit easier than heroes unavailable through specials. I think going for 5s is a safer option for me."

Sadly I have nothing else to add to this discussion but I'd like to know the answer to stacking too.  Edit: Considering numbers on other characters, where mastery only gives +1% crit rate per level, I'm going to guess their passives don't stack. Cumulative +3% chance would just be broken!"
FutureFight,3dqoil,hohndo,3,Sat Jul 18 15:28:44 2015 UTC,I figured out what I was thinking about instead when I went to go check.  I haven't experienced it stacking. It's always reset the timer similar to how picking up another attack orb resets that timer rather than making you broken and deadly.
FutureFight,3dqoil,IrmaGoodness,2,Sat Jul 18 15:46:21 2015 UTC,Is potentially stacking up 15% crit rate or so really that broken and deadly when we have crit rate special gear that are always active at far greater rates than 15%? Thanks for the feedback though.
FutureFight,3dqoil,Ashy_Larry_1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:50:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the update! Timer reset sounds perfectly reasonable.
FutureFight,3dqoil,Benny504,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:48:40 2015 UTC,I have her at 4* and just ran a few missions. I never saw it stack. I think the proc rate is so low that she almost hardly ever has a chance to proc it again before the 5 seconds are up.
FutureFight,3dqoil,Justikyzer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:28:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for checking. I really feel like Iron Fist could be a great character once ranked up, at the very least as a striker. He was my free character when I started so he's got some gear upgrades, and he can do some major damage already but I only have him at 2 stars."
FutureFight,3dqoib,rhezarus,3,Sat Jul 18 15:00:05 2015 UTC,"It's worth it if you want to rank him up quick and even as a package itself.  Cost: 2500  Uniform costs 750 so without that :1750  So you're left with x150 biometrics, 100k, x200 LVL4 EXP chips and x100 norn crystals  While the other team packages that appear in flash sales costs 1650 and only has x150 biometric (split into 50 each hero), 100k, x50 LVL4 EXP chips and no norn crystals.  So conclusion, you're paying only 100 extra crystals for an extra x150 LVL4 EXP chips and x100 norn crystals."
FutureFight,3dqoib,deathbyproxies,3,Sat Jul 18 17:03:24 2015 UTC,Esp with the norn stones because farming them consistently and a lot takes a ton of energy and tons of time

FutureFight,3dqoib,tegeusCromis,3,Sat Jul 18 15:06:07 2015 UTC,It's worth it. Got him to 5* already.

I'd say his 3rd skill probably does more damage than Vision's density shift and that's one of the best skills in the game.  I can speak on this on good authority because I do have a 5* UVision, fully mastered, 13's on gear and 30 on skills.  And my GM, only lvl 43, 9's on gear, 22 on skills, just does more damage and clears faster."

After immediately buying the set when it came out, I've been able to focus solely on YJ special missions, which has got him to 4 stars for me, as well as got my ant man and wasp up. With that said, GM is a great character in his own right, and by buying the set, you can focus your special missions on YJ, who is arguably the best character in the game. In my eyes, it was 2 great/amazing characters for the price of 1."

I think the original costume looks way better than Goliath. His third skill is killer and j have mine at 4* almost 5*. Out of Giant Man, Ant Man, and Yellow Jacket. I would say GM and YJ are the better of the two by a lot.   It's worth it in my eyes as his skills are killer and disrupt enemy animations and have a huge AoE since he turns giant. Waiting for 5* though!"

Combat - Black Panther Or Nebula (I hear Giant Man is pretty OP, but I haven't had a chance to level him/use him, so I will defer until I have)  Speed - Gamora or Spider Man (There's no competition for this one, it's pretty much a throw up between these two)  Universal - Ronan, Angela or Captain Marvel (Now I know this sub isn't the biggest fan of Captain Marvel, but I really enjoy playing as her. So it's really between Angela and Ronan, I'd probably give the slight edge to Ronan due to his leadership ability)  Yeah, yeah, I know.

FutureFight,3dpai6,bobsponge933,2,Sat Jul 18 03:48:38 2015 UTC,"Gonna disagree with some of this.  Granted, you say you haven' tried Giant Man.  Bottom line, IMO, he's better than both BP and Neb.  In terms of Universal, Ronan by a mile, actually more like a marathon better than either CM or Angela.  Angela shouldn't even be in the discussion.  Ronan's damage output, defense and leadership puts him easily above Capt Marvel.  And while CM can put out some dps, she definitely lacks a lot in the defensive catagory, and Roan can easily keep up with her on the dps front."

FutureFight,3dngin,underkill,2,Fri Jul 17 23:53:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for an awesome writeup. I've loved Captain Marvel up until now that I'm further into the game. I've been sitting on enough tokens to get her to 5 star or get a great start on Wasp or Rulk. I'm having trouble pulling the trigger on the new characters because I don't want to let her go...
FutureFight,3dngin,_markson_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:12:37 2015 UTC,"Wasp is in the chaos token store, CM and Rulk are in honor.  Most people would advise you to use your honor tokens on Gamora.  I really like her, but am not as high on her as others, probably because I only have her at three stars so far.  As for CM, I loved her until recently.  Power wise, she's outclassed by all my characters of similar level and rank, her 5-star ability just didn't do much at all for her, except make her a better mob clearer, which she was already great at.  I bought a hundred bio sale for her, and spent a bunch of honor tokens on her so I would finally have a 5-star, and now I regret it (even before I started getting other 5-stars).  My advice is not to invest in her unless you really love her or if her next rank up would be a significant boost to your overall roster (or if you buy lots of crystals)."
FutureFight,3dngin,aphysmael,2,Sat Jul 18 06:26:12 2015 UTC,"I should preface this with the fact that Ms. Marvel has always been one of my favorite characters and i really hope for her Costume (don't like the CM Uniform at all). She is my first 6*, though i am using her less frequently nowadays.  I'd like to add that she is a good kiter, as her abilities have quick animations and you can instantly move after them. Photon Blast -> Mighty Straight -> Backflip Blast -> Binary Explosion almost feels like a single fluent move, if your timing is good enough, and you should be on the run again, before the opponent has a chance to hit you.  She is no Auto character. On Autoplay she is really really bad, but if you play her manually and are used to her kiting, she can be quite good (sure no Vision, but still). Also i found her to be very quick in clearing stages, if she is sufficiently strong to do it. Which means she can't solo some of the stages an equally leveled Ronan can easily deal with, but i have cleared Ronans Special Stage #4 in 63 seconds, when she was still 45/5* and about 100 seconds when she was 40/4* (without switching out characters as i normally have two chars for leveling with me).  She has an extraordinarily quick normal attack which can hurt a lot, but as she is a glass cannon, you normally don't want to rely on that. I guess her Ability ""Lightspeed"" increases her Attack- and Movementspeed, not sure though."

FutureFight,3dq18e,shotterken,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:34:54 2015 UTC,"Each star is roughly a 25% boost from their 1* form, with a 5* hero having approximately double every stat that a 1* hero would have. If a level 1 1* hero would gain 80 HP for leveling up, a 5* would get ~160 HP"

FutureFight,3dq18e,lnfidelity,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:42:43 2015 UTC,"You don't lose anything by ranking up early vs late. You may increase stats as you level differently, but the overall stat will increase through rank up.  In short: 1* level 40 that becomes rank 2 is equal in stats to a rank 2 that becomes level 40."

FutureFight,3dq0og,stilinski03,3,Sat Jul 18 09:19:52 2015 UTC,"Get all your characters to level 40 regardless of whether you'll be getting excess exp or not... it'll be easier to use your level 40 character to plow through levels and earn exp for two other lower leveled members at a time. Having a roster full of level 40s would help you complete VS, story, and elite mode easier compared to having level 35s. Also, at level 40 u get to use 6-iso sets, which provide extra boosts to the stats that you already get reaching level 40."
FutureFight,3dq0og,crash100200,3,Sat Jul 18 09:38:29 2015 UTC,"You're afraid of getting your characters to the max level?  I'm so confused by what you're looking for. Why on earth would maxing your characters be a bad thing? Yes, rank 3 & 4 level 40s don't gain individual exp. That is what ""maximum"" means. But that doesn't make it a bad thing to use them. Lots of people will use 1 max-rank character and 2 lower ones to run content solo while power leveling the lower characters.  If this doesn't answer your question I apologize, but I'm not sure what ""doing it all wrong"" means in this case."
FutureFight,3dq0og,Extranationalidad,2,Sat Jul 18 09:41:58 2015 UTC,"Your character will not gain any exp when it reaches max level, i.e. level 40, 45, 50."
FutureFight,3dq0og,CountHalphas,2,Sat Jul 18 09:23:52 2015 UTC,You stop gaining exp at lvl 40 until you get rank 5 and then again at rank 6.  You should just get your main team to 40s at least. Makes doing another activities much easier and even carrying lower level characters if you want to level them eventually.

FutureFight,3dpva3,CountHalphas,2,Sat Jul 18 10:48:18 2015 UTC,"If you are deciding on a character to us in the Villain Siege, you should consider that they are both melee but Red Hulk uses Fire Damage which is a form of energy damage while Gamora is straight out Physical damage. Edit: You should also consider, when intending to use them on VS, that Gamora is weak against the combat heroes there and is only theoretically good with Destroyer and Ronan. While Red Hulk is a combat hero with energy damage so not for Destroyer. When considering for Arena, you should bring up the fact of the prevalence of Visions and Hulkbusters with physical damage immunity as passives so not so good for Gamora, but also the incoming prevalence of YellowJacket users which theoretically Gamora will be good against. On Red Hulk, the already prevalent Captain Marvel with her reflect would be a problem for him."
FutureFight,3dpva3,driggs333,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:20:18 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure you're wrong about fire damage being a form of energy damage because I use Rulk exclusively against the Destroyer, for his leadership, and he does just fine damage against him.  About Captain Marvel's energy reflect procing I don't know I haven't used him in Arena.  If Rulk's fire damage was a form of energy damage then wouldn't that also make Nebula's lightning damage, which wrecks the Destroyer, and GG's poison damage etc. etc. all be forms of energy damage?  I'm pretty sure it's dealt as a separate type of damage as every character has certain strengths and weaknesses against those types, Venom -10% fire resistance for example, and or resists and immunity to certain types of damage. E.g. Ghost Rider's immunity to fire, Ultron's poison resist."
FutureFight,3dpva3,ceiser,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:24:01 2015 UTC,"Not sure how fire/electricity/cold/etc. translate into physical or energy damage, but I think Destroyer has a natural 10% resistance to fire (click on the details button on his screen), mine does, anyway. So Red Hulk deals out decent physical damage plus the fire damage, which would still work on Destroyer, but likely to a lesser degree because of the built-in resistance."
FutureFight,3dpva3,driggs333,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:18:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah he might have a resistance to fire but who knows since a lot of the times the characters we fight have different strengths and weaknesses than the characters we get, for example MODOK's ridiculous shield or I just found out the Daily Ultron doesn't have bleed resist or Destroyer's own energy immunity.   But really that's beside the point I was trying to make, which was that the different ""elemental"", not sure what to call them, effects are their own form of damage and not just some mysterious form of ""energy damage""."
FutureFight,3dpva3,ceiser,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:46:42 2015 UTC,"You're right, I'm sure. I still think it's kind of funny that all those different kinds of energy damage are listed, though.

FutureFight,3dpva3,Extranationalidad,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:49:21 2015 UTC,"My Rulk is at 2* and to be honest I don't find his first two skills too appealing. His stun has a long cast animation, however it is 3 seconds. On the other hand, his first skill is very quick and deals a fair amount of damage. I think I'll hit 3* before I make a full judgment, however Gamora, like many of the other users on this reddit can tell you, is pretty strong, like Spiderman/Green Goblin strong.  For Chaos Tokens I'm aiming for Starlord 6* and saving the rest of the tokens because I'm not a fan of Hulk and while farming to a 4* Yellowjacket, I wound up with a 3* Wasp and 3* Antman thanks to shifters so the Wasp bios would be wasted."
FutureFight,3dpva3,izzuedotcom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:24:49 2015 UTC,"It's hard to recommend against any characters at 2* because some improve enormously with the 3rd star. With that said, I'm not particularly impressed with Rulk and I find that he has many of the same issues as the green guy; namely, slow windups make him very vulnerable and a lack of escape / mobility / invulnerability get him beat on.  He does have a great stun with the concrete-ripping skill, but it takes so freaking long to channel that you have to time it perfectly or you'll eat a skill or two while it preps. He can be very effectively boosted with a Fire Damage booster gear, but that'll just improve his glass cannon-hood.  Conclusion I suppose is that Rulk feels better than Hulk but only in minimal comparative ways and I wouldn't personally waste tokens on him."
FutureFight,3dpva3,DeMoNiCxTuToR,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:40:05 2015 UTC,"I have Gamora at 3* and Rulk at 3* too. Gamora is great because she's fast and her attacks have built in dodges, but at the same time the dodges can lead to unintended positioning. For example, if you're in VS against Doc Oc you can unintentionally dodge into the lasers.   I may be biased for Rulk because I'm currently using him with Ghost Rider for fire damage beyond compare. It's been working out so far because the continuous burn procs are great :)"

Fast and strong basic melee attacks? War machines got em.  Really, when you come right down to it, the only thing War Machine doesnt have it good is that he doesnt have a skill that makes him invulnerable or untargetable and that he is a Blast type so synastry weak to Speed. Further nitpicking will be that his beam attacks are not tracking like Vision's but then again, there are nobody else's beam tracking like vision.  He is decent since 2* and 3* just allows you to add a beam attack to a safe combo string, 4* just gives Daredevils stun skill the middle finger and 5*? well just watch the enemy's HP drop instantly with dat Minigun barrage. 6star skill prediction anyone? Maybe he summons a god damn tank that fires off a huge ass Minigun or giant Missile that just annihilates everything that gets in the way."

FutureFight,3dmim4,IKabobI,2,Fri Jul 17 17:20:44 2015 UTC,Agreed all around. Skill cooldowns are short enough that there's very little downtime where he's not using one and all of them will disrupt an enemy skill.  Add the IP stun and the fact that he himself can't be stunned and he just wrecks.  Definitely one of the better blast characters and the fact that he has 3 farmable elite missions and he is a shifter doesn't hurt.
FutureFight,3dmim4,Royal-Highness,2,Fri Jul 17 14:25:57 2015 UTC,Shifter? He has never been one for me before O_o

FutureFight,3dmim4,Malthan01,2,Fri Jul 17 18:56:05 2015 UTC,"It's not so much the fact that he isn't squishy as it is the fact that his play style has him performing constant safe hit-and-run attacks. Shields are better for characters which either use autoattacks or have unsafe skills.  The attack increase is definitely noticeable, though I can't honestly say I'd miss it hugely if it was gone. It's just the least bad option I can find for him, for now."

All of his skills break all perform decently whether on single of multiple targets (the Minigun Barrage on a single target is fantastically fantastic :D).  Great auto attack and his gear stats are all great (except recovery rate but that's still OK).  The only things that can be considered downsides are below average attack stats and a relatively slow beam attack (which doesn't matter when using a skill combo).

I ended up 4 starring him just by group packages for vs and by the time I had him 5 stars he really started to shine. High mobility kite Champs with good teams and strikers are hard to find generally, and he is blast which is kinda one of the better elements they way they stack combat. He does start rather weak especially compared to wm but he does hit his stride at later levels. That being said wm is better, and you could probably find better options for leader skills."

It's going to be expensive for you to max out destroyer or hulkbuster.  JI is feasible to max out with time but I don't think that team is as strong.  Don't worry about the shield lab until you have at least 1 or 2 chars with 10 gear and 20 skills.  Then you can start on the anti-matter thing and the mission thing.  For rerolling - you want the relevant attack on 1st gear, all defense on 2nd gear, hp on 3rd, defense penetration on 4th."
FutureFight,3dnl8l,OnyxStorm,3,Fri Jul 17 19:09:05 2015 UTC,"I'd say stick with farming JI cause you can have access to Spiderman and Venom bios pretty easily with elite missions, and then you can get Captain Marvel with Honor Tokens. Although I'm biased to JI because Spiderman is my favorite Marvel hero lol.  For character striking, I'm going to use the JI team as an example. So when you're using say CM to play through the level, Spiderman will sometimes randomly show up and use one his abilities and then disappear. In this case, Spiderman would have been a striker for CM. You can see which heroes will strike for your hero by going into team, and then hitting the ""Marvel Universe"" icon in the top left, picking the hero you want to use, and then you'll see the ""Striker"" tab on the right side.  As for the SHIELD Lab, this is just my opinion, but I would tell you to put all of your anti matter into the Dimension Warp Device, it's free hero exp and a free random bio per mission, so the more missions you have access to, the more stuff you can get erreyday."

However, this is only possible if the striker is on the same team as the hero he is striking for. For example, Ultron is a striker for Ronan. When my Ronan is on the same team as Ultron and Ronan is on the battlefield, there is a chance that Ultron will appear to lend a hand for Ronan by attacking, hence striking. You can view who are the strikers of your characters on their respective infos on the Marvel Universe menu under the Team tab. I cannot comment on Team Pym since I am relatively new but the rule of the thumb is you should concentrate your time and resources first on your main team. Doing this will ease up everything for you. Basically when you reroll stats, on the first gear or the attack gear the first option that you should look for is + % primary attack by level of the character. Like + 51% Energy attack per lvl or so on. This is to be followed either by + primary attack or + all attack on the succeeding options. On the 2nd gear you can choose to either go for + ------- defense per level, choosing the defensive stat that your character has a smaller value of or have + all defense altogether on all of the options."
FutureFight,3dnl8l,tegeusCromis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:21:29 2015 UTC,When you say relative to the hero type are you referring to the damage type the heels abilities do? Also what if I roll multiple +%by level stats?
FutureFight,3dnl8l,OnyxStorm,2,Fri Jul 17 20:08:39 2015 UTC,"Not the damage the skills do, but the attack stat which they draw on. E.g. If your skills say things like ""Physical attack 150% energy damage"", that means you need to boost physical attack. (Of course, all attack is fine, too.)  If you roll % based stats on any slot past the first slot on a given gear, reroll for a flat bonus. Assuming gold is not a concern.  My team recommendation for you is WM (leader), Spidey, Venom. WM's leadership and overall strength makes up for only having one weakish team bonus."
FutureFight,3dnl8l,OnyxStorm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:47:35 2015 UTC,I've re rolled most my teams with these principals in mind. Another question now. Is there defense penetration by lvl X% and all attack by lvl +X%? I haven't seen these PPP up once. Maybe I'm being trolled by RNG Jesus.
FutureFight,3dnl8l,Morsvita,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:39:16 2015 UTC,"Nope, they don't exist. Only energy/physical attack, energy/physical defence, and HP have % based boosts, IIRC."
FutureFight,3dnl8l,OnyxStorm,2,Sat Jul 18 04:32:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks guys! I've been seeing striking this whole time just wasn't aware it was on a per character basis.   My main team is all lvl 40, all geared at lvl 10 and all skills in the mid 30's with the exception of war machine who has lvl40 skills. I'm not great with isos. I know iron man and hulkbuster both have just the 3 piece sets from the get. War machine is rocking a 6 piece I just don't remember it's name. I know it has two chaotic isos in it.   I'm horrible with upgrading, farming and managing my ISO supply. I just do one daily run for the daily achievement.   So your thinking vision, ultron and giant man are a better combo than team pym? If so I believe I can farm ultron quickly with the new special mission as well as the first elite farm location. Giant man can be farmed easy with the special missions as well. Vision I only have 2 elites to farm for.   Thanks for the answers guys keep them coming!"
FutureFight,3dnl8l,chmsax,3,Fri Jul 17 19:44:55 2015 UTC,"I think it is, yes.  It also gives you 3 characters that are farmable (vision will be the hardest, but you can do ultron + vision at the same time in special stage)."
FutureFight,3dnl8l,YanHoek,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:55:30 2015 UTC,"My idea with team pym was that it's a triple bonus team where as the vision, ultron and giant man team is single bonus. Now maybe the bonuses in the team bonus section aren't that big of a deal?"
FutureFight,3dnl8l,ZimMalware,2,Fri Jul 17 20:05:22 2015 UTC,"Well, quality of the character plays into it also.  A full 5-star team of Ultron, Vision and Giant Man will stomp all over a team pym that is 3-4 stars regardless of bonuses.  Honestly you can't go wrong when the weakest link on your team is Ultron.  GM will likely be your first 5, and first 6 star also.  His is easily the fastest bio to farm in the game.  I've got him close to 6 stars and he can autoplay stuff that is higher level than he is while carrying two low levels."

But in the short time that I've been on this subreddit, I've seen that question popup a couple of times, like you said. So I figured, might as well share my findings on the matter since I personally never saw a post mentioning that it was caused by certain team-ups/leaderships. And I guess it comes in handy for those that would like to know beforehand what they're getting at the next rank :p"

FutureFight,3dmulg,nezumipi,11,Fri Jul 17 15:37:19 2015 UTC,"Common trick for more revenges:   Start the day with 5 revenge fights Clear 9 regular Arena battles and reform your team with a 1-Star leader (low level) and 1 or 2 high level characters (normal members of your team). Select a low level opponent for your last fight by either constantly refreshing the page or just hoping you can get by with 1 high level character to wipe an entire team. The game will keep you on file with the last team you used, so you'll become a beacon for fights with your low level character as your leader."

FutureFight,3dminb,Spedwards,2,Fri Jul 17 16:16:09 2015 UTC,Hmm depending on your level i guess. But even though it is not the end of the world i still think it is a considerable amount.

FutureFight,3dminb,Jellowpy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:13:41 2015 UTC,"It's never 125, if you're keeping my gears, that's 125*4 (since who upgrades just one gear slot?), which is 500. 500 debris, even if at 8 per run average, is 500 energy.  Which, at minimum, is two days of all your energy being devoted to it. However, more realistically limiting you is the fact that you're running missions only at 8 energy, meaning you need to wait for Rifts to appear.  Assuming you don't sleep, and a rate of one rift per hour (an insane expectation, mind you) that's still three days to finish your gears, or worse off if none of those things work out for you.  It really is a crappy system, and escalates with each level up."
FutureFight,3dminb,lnfidelity,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:32:29 2015 UTC,"You actually need a lot, to +15 all gears of a single hero, you need 2100 debris (525 each gear). That's a lot of farming for a single hero, what more if you want to +15 the gears of multiple heroes."
FutureFight,3dminb,hecaitomix,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:20:42 2015 UTC,An average of 9 on which level? I try to run level 1 on every rift I see and there is no way in heck I average 9. I'd say more like 3 to 5 is the average.   I agree with most here that debris is the single most limiting ingredient in the game. Unless you are loaded and can afford to buy every debris flash sale.   Unfortunately I'm not so unless anyone has any extra iTunes cards or monies they would like to donate to me I'll continue to complain lol.

FutureFight,3dminb,Spedwards,4,Fri Jul 17 14:05:24 2015 UTC,With energy costs like these they're gonna have to give like 3+ guaranteed bios or something to get people to run them again :')
FutureFight,3dminb,andaleo,6,Fri Jul 17 14:40:53 2015 UTC,Or just lower the energy requirement... I'd be happy with it not incrementing by 1 after each run.
FutureFight,3dminb,Spedwards,2,Fri Jul 17 14:55:32 2015 UTC,Or that yeah. But decrease the initial cost as well cause 16 for stage 3 (I think) is too much for a single run.
FutureFight,3dminb,andaleo,2,Fri Jul 17 16:10:56 2015 UTC,"I always thought it odd that the initial cost for the lowest was double the cost of a normal stage. And then it kept going up by 1 in each bracket per run you do.  Maybe something like   Rank 1: 4 Energy per run Rank 2: 5 Energy per run Rank 3: 6 Energy per run Rank 4: 7 Energy per run Rank 5: 8 Energy per run   And just have the cost be static. In return off course you have the higher chance on Bio's as well as the higher chance of bonus gear and its quality, and perhaps have a sliding scale for debris (IE rank 5 would yield 3x the amount what rank 1 would) so;   Rank 1 yields x debris (x1) Rank 2 yields x debris (x1.5) Rank 3 yields x debris (x2) Rank 4 yields x debris (x2.5) Rank 5 yields x debris (x3)"
FutureFight,3dminb,MacStabby,3,Sat Jul 18 13:19:36 2015 UTC,"The increasing cost per run is prohibitive enough, having all start at 6 would be a fair and easy way to go.  even at 10 runs then it would be 105 energy.  Prohibitive enough for heavy farming, but makes it still worth running 2-4 every time it pops up."
FutureFight,3dminb,TheRoonis,4,Fri Jul 17 14:53:42 2015 UTC,Not worth it at all so I never do them anymore  They need to lower the cost to 6 for all difficulties and dont let the cost go up

I would definitely at least invest in Starlord and Gamora.  Starlord makes an already godly Vision even more godly and any other blaster for that matter.  While Gamora pretty much shreds Destroyer and Ronan in VS."

FutureFight,3dn6oi,Sqube,6,Fri Jul 17 17:09:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have the same problem. I was looking for a YJ team but aside from Team Pym there aren't really that many. Even if wanted to make a team solely with characters that strike for him when you attack I couldn't cause I either don't like the character or I don't have him/her unlocked :/.  I think I'm just gonna run a Wasp led team with YJ and GM, see how that goes. At least then you get a nice attack, defense and speed boost from her leadership and another attack and defense boost from the YJ/GM team bonus."
FutureFight,3dn6oi,andaleo,4,Fri Jul 17 18:14:37 2015 UTC,"He only has a handful that strike when he attacks (getting hit strikers are useless to him) and most are either meh or hard to farm.

FutureFight,3dn6oi,TheRoonis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:34:05 2015 UTC,"Check out yj/giant/goblin. They are strikers for each other and a fun team. And it is balanced, meaning blast/speed/combat. I'm trying it out and like it."
FutureFight,3dn6oi,Skripclub,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:02:41 2015 UTC,"Another balanced team would be YJ, Ant-Man, Luke Cage. Two team up bonuses, and a 3rd if you have at least 2 at the same rank. AM and LC strike for each other but they'll all make good use of YJ leadership. Right now my Luke Cage is a bit underleveled to really put this team to the test, but I think it could work pretty well. You get attack, crit rate, hp and d pen bonuses. I haven't unlocked Giantman yet so haven't been able to try the one you suggested. Is he as good as everyone says he is? I can stand how he looks(and his alt uniform is even worse) so I haven't made him a priority."
FutureFight,3dn6oi,-Hexagon-,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:50:23 2015 UTC,I have him at 5* 10 gear 20 skills and he clears levels better than anyone. He has 4 skills that flow well and hit HARD.

FutureFight,3dn1hv,zaShadow,4,Fri Jul 17 16:42:15 2015 UTC,I have Dodge Ignore on Ronan because it pisses me off that his already slow normal attack misses. For Vision I got Dodge so it counters his squishiness.

FutureFight,3dnvl5,avgibby,2,Sat Jul 18 07:11:12 2015 UTC,"In no particular order for me>   Doc Oc...  His auto attack stinks.  His skills are slow and take too long to recover from.  He's relegated to low level Villain Siege fodder for me. Punisher...  Slow movement, slow attacks, and relies too much on his 3* buff skill to make his attacks do any decent damage.  Disappointing.  I also don't care for his model design. Ghost Rider...  Never used him, but there has been a lot of negative feedback for him posted here and elsewhere.  Thus I stayed far far away."

FutureFight,3dnvl5,mwriteword,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:50:29 2015 UTC,"I gotta go with Ghost Rider on this one.  Sure he can get better later as he gets up in stars and level, but then so can all of the others.  With the others that are mentioned, IF, Blade, etc... they can do some damage, the trick is to time your attack well.  A lot of them hae a charge skill that ends up with them behind their opponent.  Use that skill 1st, then the others.  It helps a ton in mitigating damage and dealing damage.  Punisher, for me, isn't so bad as he's a least a range character than can drop a grenade and run away.  Ghost Rider however, with his motorcycle attack pretty much runs up into or near melee range to attack with his motorcycle....  The funny thing is he's typicaly a step or 2 outside it when he calls it, then the mob runs into full melee range and the attack then misses over 50% of the time."
FutureFight,3dnvl5,Blitqz21l,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:49:39 2015 UTC,"The motorcycle isn't that bad. I find it pretty useful. I just use it when the boss is casting a skill or running straight at me.

FutureFight,3dmj2v,Marc_Quill,4,Fri Jul 17 14:42:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly, that attack is something else.   I've always struggled with Bullseye in VS, even at lower levels. Between him and Vision, he suddenly ain't so scary. And I only have both at 3 stars"
FutureFight,3dmj2v,y2fitzy,2,Fri Jul 17 14:46:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, at 2*, I thought he was extremely overrated.  He's now rank-5, and he's easily one of my favorite characters to play.  If you know how to land his Aether Bolt, he is a boss killing machine."
FutureFight,3dmj2v,imjms737,2,Fri Jul 17 15:21:35 2015 UTC,He can solo VS Dr Ock and Bulleye
FutureFight,3dmj2v,nashvision,3,Fri Jul 17 14:13:40 2015 UTC,That's not really important. What's important is that he can solo them at levels far beyond his own. When my 3* Malekith was level 29 I was soloing VS6 Bullseye with him.

FutureFight,3dmu89,Blurkillerex,2,Fri Jul 17 15:34:35 2015 UTC,It does seem auto play seem a little bit more proficient with attacking. But I'm pretty sure you can do the same. Try moving the directional pad towards the enemy after you kill one.
FutureFight,3dmu89,Augmentedforth,3,Fri Jul 17 15:42:50 2015 UTC,"Tried it many times, it only works when it feels like it though. Like 1/10th of the time or maybe less"

Most of the time I see it happen though, the beam only just kills the main target so you see him flicker to the next target before it finishes.  Apparently it will swap automatically though... I don't play manual much as I prefer to multi-task. Perhaps someone else can answer this."
FutureFight,3dm5tn,the2ndfifth,11,Fri Jul 17 11:46:51 2015 UTC,"Vision has beam attack that tracks his targets. Probably the best beam attack I've seen so far. I heard that Iron Man's does a lot of damage, but can't confirm."

I'll have to try him out again now that he's higher leveled.  Haven't tried ironman's unibeam yet, I do have him at 3* tho so I'll have to experiment with that too.  As of right now Cap Marvel is 4* and lvl 40, so I doubt I'll be replacing her for my main, but I'm looking for some alt teams to level up."
FutureFight,3dm5tn,Zephyraine,3,Fri Jul 17 11:52:32 2015 UTC,War Machine 3* has a beam attack too. I think Vision is the best based on tracking properties whereas everyone else is about the same except Ultron. Ultron's beam only hit 3 times which is pretty bad.
FutureFight,3dm5tn,IKabobI,3,Fri Jul 17 12:10:26 2015 UTC,"Vision is one of the best characters in the game. Cap'n Marvel is good at lower ranks but her usefulness really drops off later.   If you want beam attacks Vision, War Machine, and Iron Man I would all put ahead of the Cap. Ronan and Destroyer also have beam attacks but their usefulness is more team dependent."

FutureFight,3dm5tn,Spedwards,3,Fri Jul 17 12:11:53 2015 UTC,Vision probably has the best in the game.  Venom's Parasitic Shot would have to come in second as long as you count it as a beam attack. It's a homing skill that will ricochet as well.  I have a feeling M.O.D.O.K's is going to be really good.

FutureFight,3dm5tn,Thesparkone,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:56:06 2015 UTC,What level does MODOK start to get good at? I kinda walked away after 3*.
FutureFight,3dm5tn,Spedwards,2,Fri Jul 17 18:33:30 2015 UTC,1
FutureFight,3dm5tn,Thesparkone,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:53:10 2015 UTC,I really fail to see how MODOK is one of the best blasters. I don't see how he could possibly make the top 5 considering how many really good blasters there are.
FutureFight,3dm5tn,Spedwards,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:46:20 2015 UTC,"Top Tier: Vision, War Machine, Yellowjacket  2nd Tier: Malekith, Star-Lord  3rd Tier: M.O.D.O.K, Iron Man  Bottom Tier: Wasp, Rocket Raccoon, Red Skull    This is just my opinion on the rankings. I'm basing it mainly off Siege.  I would probably also merge 2nd & 3rd tiers..."
FutureFight,3dm5tn,Thesparkone,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:58:16 2015 UTC,"Eh, Rocket is way better than MODOK, and should be at least 2nd Tier. If you're basing it off VS, then how is Malekith not top tier? Also, Wasp isn't that bad. She starts off with 2 safe ranged attacks, and I believe 1 allows her to go through Doc's lasers unharmed."

It makes exactly as much sense as the enemies having similar attack, HP, defence, or any other stat as you do. Which is to say, not much. The point of upgrading (whether through gear or other methods) is to become stronger relative to the enemy. If upgrading your stats also upgraded your enemies', you'd just be running in place."

FutureFight,3dkoue,bobsponge933,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:46:03 2015 UTC,"One step at a time, i suppose.  Apparently, it's each villain gives #Y of experience, while the boss, and completing the level, boosts that score by 5% (Which is why heroes that die only get goon experience and not ""I survived"" experience).  I need more time to do other levels, but overall, this is based off of Giant Man's Special Mission 4. Each one will have a slightly different experience stat due to it being per villain, not per level."

FutureFight,3dkoue,CountHalphas,2,Fri Jul 17 01:48:00 2015 UTC,"Groovy. Thank You.  I also do apologize if you were planning on posting this first; as you had started from level 1 and I'm stuck with a roster of mid 20's with the occasional 42.  I do like your chart a bit better, it shows where you got your info, while I used same level Heroes and used level 1 chips to emulate the amount of experience gained during one level to emulate how much each run gave me, to a rough estimate.  I'd like to compare once we have finished each, just to see how far off my solution may or may not be."

FutureFight,3dkoue,pksullivan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:58:06 2015 UTC,"So far, I've found that (with Best condition) the Special Missions give out the best bang-for your buck, assuming you can grind them in under two minutes. ~3-4% on a level 39 for experience, while also gaining exp. chips, and bios."
FutureFight,3dkoue,precursor_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:00:48 2015 UTC,"I've found Yellowjacket's Special Mission especially good for grinding, because on top of his bios you can get either Wasp's or Ant-Man's. And you get an ally shifter with no enemy shifter or secondary enemy boss, which makes his stages faster and easier. And Yellowjacket is powerful and really fun, but I guess that's not really a grinding thing."
FutureFight,3dkoue,ConcealedTerror,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:17:14 2015 UTC,Giant Man's Special Mission was an amazing source of XP for me getting some of my heroes up to 40. Ran it at tier 4.
FutureFight,3dn6aw,nerfspiderman,10,Fri Jul 17 17:06:38 2015 UTC,Have you used him?
FutureFight,3dn6aw,OnyxStorm,8,Fri Jul 17 17:16:15 2015 UTC,This. My first thought when I read this thread. GM is OP
FutureFight,3dn6aw,Blurkillerex,8,Fri Jul 17 17:21:34 2015 UTC,"Giant man right now is the weakest link    Lol, what? Have you actually used his 3rd and 4th skill? Or noticed he is statistically the best character in the game by miles 2/3rds of the time?  HP is the only gear bonus worth a darn imo, others claim def pen is solid too. He has both. And he has your coveted critical rate and damage even though it takes thousands of points for those two to make an impact. You seem to be upset that he will miss out on ~200 points of critical rate; you do know that is like 1% right?"
FutureFight,3dn6aw,toysoldierxiii,7,Fri Jul 17 17:17:30 2015 UTC,"Lol, what? Have you actually used his 3rd and 4th skill? Or noticed he is statistically the best character in the game by miles 2/3rds of the time?   Truth.  OP seems to just be theorycrafting on stats."
FutureFight,3dn6aw,OnyxStorm,6,Fri Jul 17 17:20:28 2015 UTC,I like your suggestions on gear. I rerolled all my options to HP (with % on the first line) on gear 3 and defense penetration for his 4th gear. On the first one should I focus on phys attack + and on the second energy defense?
FutureFight,3dn6aw,piratecalvin,4,Fri Jul 17 17:51:40 2015 UTC,"Yup, sounds good. Although if you have the money to burn try rolling all defense on the second since the max amounts are the same.  I'm still testing out def pen vs cooldown on the 4th gear as well; thus far penetration is winning."
FutureFight,3dn6aw,toysoldierxiii,5,Fri Jul 17 18:04:14 2015 UTC,Everyone has a differing opinions but I do not consider him a weak link at all. Team Pym is a very very good team. GM stats may not be perfect but he's plowing through everything with ease for me
FutureFight,3dn6aw,Gpaint,5,Fri Jul 17 17:17:21 2015 UTC,"The other comments here have, indirectly, given you your answer: his gear is sub-optimal because his kit is already so good. If he had all the best gear options, he'd be OTT."
FutureFight,3dn6aw,tegeusCromis,4,Fri Jul 17 18:14:50 2015 UTC,"I have GM at 5 stars and with his 4th skill, he does at least 20K damage and up to 40K damage against speed characters.  His 3 star skill growing pains does around 10K -15K damage.  His first skill is almost 100% break but sometimes (may 10%) whiffs by overshooting the target.  All of his skills cause flinch/break.  With his passive and uniform it add adds 20% damage and defense 2/3 of the time with increased movement speed.  Farming him is incredibly easy.  I am getting about 35-40 of his bios a day.  For me he will be 6 stars in about 7-8 days.  Running the 4th level takes about 45-55 seconds but in actual time with loading and stuff about 2 minutes."
FutureFight,3dn6aw,precursor_,4,Fri Jul 17 17:35:36 2015 UTC,"Don't dwell too much on the gears, play him and decide if he's worth investing. I find him to be a very fun character to play as he clears level really fast.   His 3* and 5* skills are super high damaging and with his uniform, he gets +30% attack and defend most of the time. I also gave him the angel of death iso-8 set to reduce his skill cooldown and he's pretty much enlarged and stomping trash throughout the stage.  You should really give him a chance, try him for yourself, maybe he'll grow on you (pun intended)"
FutureFight,3dn6aw,Blurkillerex,2,Fri Jul 17 17:38:28 2015 UTC,"Fang reading all the replies, I didn't realize Giant Man was that good. Looks like he's on my list of to level up."
FutureFight,3dn6aw,Augmentedforth,2,Fri Jul 17 19:45:10 2015 UTC,GM is a monster hero.  Obviously you've not used him.  His dmg is above avg and his skills breaks the enemy.   Seems like you are the weakest link.
FutureFight,3dn6aw,Gregole,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:00:38 2015 UTC,"Let me just say this.  I've only cleared VS9 twice.  Both times, Giant Man (Goliath) was beyond vital in accomplishing this.    Yesterday, when Destroyer was stage 8, he soloed him as a brand new 5*, and still level 40, and it wasn't even close.  50% health left at the end.  So, not only was he able to put enough dps out to take down a boss 9 levels above him,, he was also able to take a few hits.  add note here, he was also only rank 2 mastery.  Today, Bullseye was stage 8, he took off 40% off.  It was the last 40% of his health after I glitched with Malekith.  He got stuck between a mob of bots and my finger slipped.  I personally thought GM was going to get wrecked but I said WTH, give it a shot.  And bam, Bullseye never stood a chance.  edit note:  And by no means have I even come close to min/maxing him either.  gears at 9/9/9/9, skills at 20, and no special gear equipped either.  Add that I do have a 6 piece ISO set, but all ISO's are 2*'s.  And since I plan on getting him to 50 in about a week, I'm holding off on higher ranked ISO's just in case I need to put new ones in, which I know will happen.  All that means, already beyond beastly and god tier, and once he actually gets all his stuff, he's gonna be untouchable."
FutureFight,3dn6aw,Blitqz21l,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:39:52 2015 UTC,I think gMan skill not worth the millions of gold to upgrade. Spin2win only get 3 damage per level while he hits for 1k+ each. And footfall also give little return on leveling
FutureFight,3dldxu,lohloh88,6,Fri Jul 17 05:23:50 2015 UTC,"i wouldn't be surprised if they implement something like ""Buy an extra Team Slot with 500 crystals"" in the future"

If netmarble was upfront with us saying that's why they charged extra for slots, then I'd be fine with paying for extra team slots."
FutureFight,3dldxu,eak125,2,Fri Jul 17 06:44:20 2015 UTC,"oh yea i'm feel the same way and have no problems paying extra. god knows how much i'm spending on this game already. i'm just saying i can see that sort of thing happening in the future because from other NetMarble games i've played in the past, they've had the option to spend crystals to increase your total energy cap."

FutureFight,3dldxu,eak125,3,Fri Jul 17 08:26:39 2015 UTC,I just wish there was a quicker way to get to the available teams when you select a certain character instead of having to memorize them or scroll through the entire list.
FutureFight,3dldxu,bruddahmanmatt,3,Fri Jul 17 06:18:14 2015 UTC,Or something where you select a character and it just lists all the teams they're a part of.
FutureFight,3dldxu,TrackXII,2,Fri Jul 17 06:45:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, three slots isn't enough. One more slot would be fine. Two more would be ideal."

FutureFight,3dldxu,Karzak85,2,Fri Jul 17 06:01:03 2015 UTC,Yes. Either simplify the selection of a team or give more saving slots. It's already super messy with just 50 characters. What happens when we get twice that number ?

I'll assume you are; here's my 2c on that.  1st gear should have energy attack % in the first slot, not flat. And you should reroll that 47% to flat energy or all attack.  If you want to optimise, you should reroll the energy defence to all defence. Though I guess you know that.  3rd gear should be HP % in the first slot and flat HP in the others. Iron Man could use the extra survivabiliry, like most/all heroes.  As for ISOs, I don't see a problem with sticking to Bloodthirst. You can throw away an awful lot of gold hoping to get the 8-ISO set you want."

FutureFight,3dkhrq,hoju83,2,Fri Jul 17 00:44:13 2015 UTC,It's really only worth doing if you're close to breaking the top 50 (or 100 I guess) in Arena rankings towards the end of the week.    If spending 125 crystals to get an extra 10 fights guarantees you a spot in the top 100 then it'd be worth is since you'd get a return of 315 crystals.    I'm curious to find out how many crystals the top 5 players spend in their attempts to secure Rank 1 for the 3500 crystals.
FutureFight,3dkhrq,Blitqz21l,2,Fri Jul 17 05:07:58 2015 UTC,"I did some simple math and in order to get top 10, you pretty much have to buy the additional 20 per day, cheese the system to get 8 days worth of match ups, and be extremely selective on your matchups.  There are very few points that separate the top 20 and losing any matches, or even playing a couple of teams per day that are even to you, esp in the early part of the week can mean getting your crystals back, or only getting half of them back."

I have a tiny little whispering schadenfreude in my head hoping his 6* skill isn't very impressive, since I think the chances I arrive there within the next few months are exceedingly low..."
FutureFight,3dhwf0,Extranationalidad,2,Thu Jul 16 19:24:23 2015 UTC,Well if you can afford it then you can get benefits through it.
FutureFight,3dhwf0,cannonmax,2,Thu Jul 16 12:37:07 2015 UTC,"This is actually just what I needed, thanks for drawing our attention to it."
FutureFight,3dhwf0,Bee_Kamiya,2,Thu Jul 16 14:32:01 2015 UTC,Thinking of not taking this deal.  I have enough crystals to buy it. But my HB is only at 8/80 and I don't usually use him that much. I'd rather save the 160 crystals for a Black Cat or Angela (two of the three heroes that I don't have)
FutureFight,3dhwf0,yoonjay,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:21:41 2015 UTC,Its a way to get people used to opening their wallets. Very sneaky method.
FutureFight,3dhwf0,darganas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:37:39 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat. My HB is sooooooo far from 5* - and, considering I can't farm bios from anywhere, I'm going to save the crystals."
FutureFight,3dhwf0,chmsax,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:47:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah same, this would put me at 12/80 and really no closer to 4🌟 unless he's added somewhere else in the game.  I guess he's gonna just be stuck at 3🌟 like Malekith and Black Cat."
FutureFight,3dhwf0,Eselgee,2,Fri Jul 17 03:35:52 2015 UTC,"This is what a good business model is. if you don't have 160 crystal, even though the true value of 10 bios is only 60 crystal, you'll be obliged of buying crystals at the shop just to compensate the minimum crystal needed to buy the item. In the end, they still made a profit :). And I think they're doing this as a test, if this model would work for them."
FutureFight,3dhwf0,illusion247,2,Thu Jul 16 18:04:23 2015 UTC,Good price for the biometrics. And i think the crystals bought count towards your VIP-score. Can someone else confirm this please?
FutureFight,3dhwf0,MrCerias,3,Thu Jul 16 12:25:28 2015 UTC,"Crystals bought only count towards VIP if you pay cash for them.  So if you buy the cheapest crystal pack to purchase these bios then yes it counts towards VIP.  But if you have 160 crystals and just snag the deal, no that is not ""buying"" crystals and doesn't count towards VIP."
FutureFight,3dhwf0,torosan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:16:04 2015 UTC,"It doesn't. You're not buying crystals with your money, you're buying bios and crystals with crystals :P."

I just don't want to buy something because it's a good deal.  Give me a deal that I can use and I'll snap it up in an instant, but my HB is around 150 bios away from rank 5, and I don't use him very much either, just VS.

FutureFight,3dhwf0,HoodooX,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:35:29 2015 UTC,I need help on this deal.  As a new player with 1/20 for Hulk Buster is this worthwhile?  I see the tier charts and understand that Hulkbuster is really good.  Or should I save my crystals for something else that will be more useful to me at my low level?  Thanks in advance!
FutureFight,3dhwf0,AJFahres,2,Thu Jul 16 20:43:43 2015 UTC,"It's the best value for your crystals as far as Bio's goes since the best value packs are 100 for 1100 crystals or 11/bio. However, that'll put you at 11/20 and he's currently only available as a random shifter when you do normal/elite missions so snagging those remaining 9 is going to be difficult.  For reference I've been playing about 3 weeks pretty heavily and I've only gotten 12 Hulk Buster bio's ever.  This unlocked him for me so I can finally use/level him, but I've already gotten quite a few 3* heroes and I'm not seeing another 40 of him for a while.."
FutureFight,3dhwf0,TrackXII,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:27:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice.   Is there any resource or reference for what shifters can be found in a given level? Is it as completely random as it seems?
FutureFight,3dhwf0,AJFahres,2,Fri Jul 17 02:33:34 2015 UTC,"All the elite and normal mission strikers are pulled from a pool, you can find a list in the resource guide in the sidebar.  The special missions usually have 2-3 specific ones keyed to that stage if any at all.  One always appears in the stage if it has shifters but the bio chance isn't guaranteed as it is with normal/elite shifters."
FutureFight,3dhwf0,TrackXII,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:35:15 2015 UTC,"I was so happy waking up to this earlier, was just enough to 3* my Hulkbuster finally, slowly getting my Anger Management team ranked up"

FutureFight,3dhwf0,bobsponge933,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:31:00 2015 UTC,I don't understand why they would do this?  It's like a store charging you $160 for something and give you the item plus $100 back.
FutureFight,3dhwf0,maximumtesticle,5,Thu Jul 16 12:22:35 2015 UTC,"Making sure you meet a criteria? I see it lots of times...  It's like buying a brand new car that guarantees $1,000 cash back."

FutureFight,3dhwf0,rhysappa12,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:28:13 2015 UTC,"Cheapest you see them is 11 per bio in the 100 or 2x-3x 50 packs.  The worst you see them as flash sales is 16 per bio at 10 for 160 crystals.  You can get worse in the dimension shop, 20-50 a bio.  At 6 per bio this is better than the best flash sales by about 83%."
FutureFight,3dhwf0,TrackXII,0,Fri Jul 17 00:23:44 2015 UTC,"why give us back 100 crystals, they should've just made it 10/60"
FutureFight,3dhwf0,MegaMohsi,3,Thu Jul 16 12:29:25 2015 UTC,"I think is a sale gimmick thing where they want you to use IRL money on their crystal packs to get this deal. Still, not too bad for whom already have 160 crystals to spare."
FutureFight,3dhwf0,zaShadow,6,Thu Jul 16 12:54:53 2015 UTC,"Basically this.  In the end, it only costs 60 crystals, but if you dont' have 160 you'll have to buy at least the cheapest pack."
FutureFight,3dhwf0,BrainWav,2,Thu Jul 16 13:06:54 2015 UTC,This also makes me really really wish there was a way to consistently get Hulk Buster bios every since they removed him from the Chaos Token store.

FutureFight,3dipyi,GrandEthos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:40:57 2015 UTC,"Mine is up to 35 or so, 4 stars, full mastery. He definitely hands out the damage, especially when his health is down below 30%.  He and Venom make good tanks. I use them to level up lower chars."
FutureFight,3dipyi,SuperShadowStar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:43:25 2015 UTC,"I have him at 40, but only 2*s and with a 46% fire damage item. The first two attacks are really slow, slower than Hulk. The 2nd one does cause stun, but it has crazy recovery frames on the animation. I was excited when I first saw him, but if half of his skills are this lackluster, I'm hesitant to get him more ranks."

Rulk's leadership effectively gives himself a 50% boost in fire damage, another 50% from the gear."

So a total of ~10-14 for the two no limits every day. Assuming 40 second load times its still ~4-5 extra missions. Even if the drop rate is lower (I doubt its significantly lower), you still get shifters in my mind its more worth it to do 4. Do 5 for the chapter achievement to get to the no limit"
FutureFight,3dik09,Ashy_Larry_1,2,Thu Jul 16 15:55:45 2015 UTC,I'm doing 5 for the building up the no limit and sort of leaning towards 4 for the no-limit itself as Ronan is level 50 and will get no benefit but Ultron needs to be levelled whilst able to solo 4 so I think I might have an answer if I'm being sensible about it.
FutureFight,3dik09,Extranationalidad,3,Thu Jul 16 16:46:56 2015 UTC,"I've been running 5 exclusively. I'm not 100% sure it's the right choice, but between the drops feeling really excellent and the fact that even though I have to use lvl45 Vision who gets no exp, I can powerlevel the other two I bring along so freaking fast, it's felt like a decent move."
FutureFight,3dik09,agent_patrick_star,2,Thu Jul 16 16:54:38 2015 UTC,"go for 5. Take into account loading times. More missions=more loading. In the end you might only do a few more missions, but with a noticeable difference in drop rate."
FutureFight,3dik09,Blitqz21l,2,Thu Jul 16 15:51:17 2015 UTC,My only issue with 5 is that not all 3 will be levelling up so it's a bit of a waste of a slot and special missions give great exp.  I have been flip-flopping between 4 and 5 in this no limit run if I'm being honest.

FutureFight,3djsdq,xPUSSYSLAYARx,9,Thu Jul 16 21:02:03 2015 UTC,"He is a very high damage, high survivability (as far as Blasters go) character with invincibility frames on two of his skills and an extremely strong CC that he gives to the entire team as his Leadership. Yes, he is good. VERY good.  All of his gear upgrades are the top tier ones you want (No movespeed or recovery rate. It is all damage or survivability oriented). In addition, he has a CC that only two people in the entire game can resist; Black Bolt or Malekith as leader. Everyone else gets Paralyzed. Considering he also gets 4 seconds of it at higher Leadership levels, it is probably the strongest CC move in the game. Giving it to the whole team is just overkill.  He does have one or two weak points, however. Firstly, almost all of his skills are single-target. This means he can pour the damage on, and is EXTREMELY effective in VS, boss fights, or Arena. He suffers a bit in his clearing of larger mobs, though. He has to kill each target individually, instead of how a lot of characters can just use a single AoE and hit everyone. If the group is large enough, it can become a threat to him because of it.  In addition, being blaster, he also suffers from a Type Disadvantage to a few of the more popular Arena characters. It is a testament to how good he is that he STILL mops the floor with most of them, but it hurts him to do so. If he was only Universal...   In conclusion, he is in the top 3 EASILY, and a contender for top 1."
FutureFight,3djsdq,chaoticheartld,8,Thu Jul 16 21:24:35 2015 UTC,"Oh man, if he was universal.. The ronan/vision/yellowjacket would've been hands down the best team in the game."

FutureFight,3djsdq,Augmentedforth,4,Thu Jul 16 23:54:53 2015 UTC,"CC stands for Crowd Control. In this game, it refers to abilities that render the opponent unable to perform actions (e.g. Wasp's Silence that prevents abilities, Venom/Malekith's Fear attacks, Spiderman/Daredevil's Stun attacks). Yellowjack's Mastery has a Paralyzing effect for your entire team."
FutureFight,3djsdq,noodle578,2,Fri Jul 17 00:07:00 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. thanks!"
FutureFight,3djsdq,Augmentedforth,2,Fri Jul 17 00:31:59 2015 UTC,"It stands for Crowd Control. Old MMO terminology for anything used to ""control"" a crowd of mobs; usually spells/skills that paralyze, stun, mezmerize, etc. It has been appropriated to mean any type of stun/coccoon/etc; anything that temporarily takes a target out of the fight.  In this case, it is referencing YJ's Paralysis ability."
FutureFight,3djsdq,chaoticheartld,2,Fri Jul 17 00:06:37 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, CC was the one thing I didn't really pay attention to. I'm assuming having a CC player pretty good?"
FutureFight,3djsdq,Augmentedforth,2,Fri Jul 17 00:32:41 2015 UTC,"In most MMOs and ARPGs crowd control is great, almost necessary depending on the game, because a frozen/stunned enemy is one that can't hurt you.   For most of Future Fight it's unnecessary because mobs die too fast for crowd control to have any real effect. That leaves the huge health boss fights, aka Villain Siege and Arena, where a few seconds of slow or immobility can really make a difference.   TL;DR, Yellowjacket is essentially the perfect single-target killer."

With that said, he handles most regular content with ease without any strikers. All of the high-end content like Arena, VS, etc you don't get strikers for anyway.

FutureFight,3dhsro,YanHoek,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:48:40 2015 UTC,"If they do Kree/Skrull war, I think it will bode well for the inclusion of non-MCU properties into the game. My understanding is that the Skrull are part of the FF license, and that's why the MCU has been focusing on the Kree (also because they tie in with Inhumans, who are their replacement mutants). If they do KvS, that means that may be willing to do FF and other non-MCU content."

FutureFight,3difu7,zestymongoose,2,Thu Jul 16 16:45:34 2015 UTC,He's alot of fun. Very fast auto attack. Good striker. His 3rd skill is crazy on packs of mobs but not the safest skill in VS. The skill needs a single target damage boost. His 2nd skill hits hard now and is excellent on bosses. His first skill should be used to create distance if a boss is on you.    I feel like he needs one more tweak but he's well worth leveling and much better than originally thought.

It's that your thread was just an assertion that replacing Spidey with Cap A improved the team, devoid of any kind of reasoning for why you asserted that. What's the point?

Green Goblin is better on his own as far as I have seen with 4 star of each, but having Ant Man as a striker and the massive team bonuses, I would go (and did go) with team Pym.

FutureFight,3dgse6,tegeusCromis,2,Thu Jul 16 04:35:43 2015 UTC,Is MODOK good? He seems really unwieldy to me. The Vision bios might make it worth farming Ant-Man at a slower pace.
FutureFight,3dgse6,tegeusCromis,2,Thu Jul 16 04:37:12 2015 UTC,"he improves a lot at 5 stars. He is a bit unwieldy, but that's part of his charm. Once you play with him a bit it gets easier. Also, he is the second easiest character to 6 star for free after Giant Man, has the mind special gear for 2 of his best skills, and strikes for a lot of good characters."
FutureFight,3dgse6,coju3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:16:05 2015 UTC,"I find him really good for killing Bullseye in VS. Also decent against Ock and Ronan (though anyon can take him on, really). Stun —> a bunch of basic attacks —> skill 3 is deadly. The blast-off can be thrown in when you're close to the boss and you would have been hit anyway."
FutureFight,3dgse6,tegeusCromis,2,Thu Jul 16 06:44:46 2015 UTC,Some anti-Bullseye tech would be nice. He's the most vexing villain siege boss for me. Everyone else I have a handle on. Bullseye's just annoying.
FutureFight,3dgse6,JaviEclectico,2,Thu Jul 16 13:56:35 2015 UTC,Then I strongly suggest giving him a go. Just skip the blast off until you're sure you know what you're doing. It is easy to end up eating BS's OP melee attack if you blast off at the wrong moment.
FutureFight,3dgse6,IrmaGoodness,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:15:38 2015 UTC,I usually save the blast off for when I get swarmed by robots. It completes before they explode and knocks you back out of their range.
FutureFight,3dgse6,JaviEclectico,0,Thu Jul 16 20:17:25 2015 UTC,"Surprised there isn't more support for this view. Maybe people still underrate MODOK. Once you consider MODOK bios as something worth having, stage 5, with its shifters, becomes obviously more attractive than stage 2."

Tuesday I farmed 30 Ultron bios.  (10 Specials + 2 NoLimit Specials + Elite 1-8) Wednesday I farmed 31 Ulton bios. If I were running stage 5 I'd be splitting the bios between Ultron and M.O.D.O.K. and that would presumably mean I'd have gotten about 30 bios total for Ultron in the last two days, and an equal number for M.O.D.O.K., whom I never use.  Personally, my plan is to max Ultron, then farm the YJ mission for YJ, Ant-Man, and Wasp.    It is worth it to me to get 6* asap and forgo the shifters. A single level 50 is far more valuable to me than an extra 3 or 4 star."

So someone might have messed up when making level 1, copied it to levels 2-5 and forgot to fix it.  MODOK being combat for one mission could have simply been a mis-click.  As for why it hasn't been fixed, I'd guess it's just not a big enough deal to have a special downtime for."

This could have been what happened but it is very unlikely. Programmers don't change their patterns, we don't like change. If something works the first time, we're going to keep using it.  M.O.D.O.K. was a mistake. Yellowjacket was either intentional or programmed by someone who didn't realise he was Blast."
FutureFight,3dhm1l,Spedwards,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:00:11 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand.  I don't mean tools to copy-and-paste, I mean their level-editor tools probably allow them to take a mission and make a copy.  They can then edit the copy to make it different.  I highly doubt there's any actual coding involved in creating levels, beyond implementing new features into the level editor.  My scenario is: NM employee makes YJ's first stage.  He accidentally sets YJ as Combat and doesn't catch it.  NM employee then copies that first stage to the other 4 and just changes the level information, thus carrying over the accidental Combat YJ."
FutureFight,3dhm1l,BrainWav,-4,Thu Jul 16 12:12:08 2015 UTC,"They probably use Notepad++... Maybe Eclipse, Netbeans, or Visual Studio...  By your answer, I'm assuming your not a programmer?"
FutureFight,3dhm1l,Spedwards,5,Thu Jul 16 12:17:37 2015 UTC,"I am (and I do use Notepad++).  And you're not understanding what I mean.  I highly, highly doubt that NM level designers do any coding at all.  Their level tools are likely more akin to Valve's Hammer level editor than a text editor.  Making a level entirely in a text editor would be difficult and obtuse."
FutureFight,3dhm1l,BrainWav,-2,Thu Jul 16 12:24:17 2015 UTC,"God no! Designers probably don't code at all!  Designers design the stage and the character models. Programmers create character animations, put stages together (including model positioning, difficulty, etc.). Translators edit ALL the visible text in the game."

FutureFight,3dhm1l,Trunksshe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:29:56 2015 UTC,"""Yellow Jacket; Why is he ""Combat"" type during his mission but ""Blast"" type as a character when you obtain him?  Just in case people are confused.  If it is my 2 cents you want it is because he is naturally a blast type always as a more of a ranged attacks. Pew pew pew.  But during his mission the nature of the battles are different as you are now fighting him in his already miniature size as you are in Vision's body.  So from that perspective in such a small and enclosed area he is more of a close combat type.  TL;DR: His mission stage changes his nature because the circumstances are different."
FutureFight,3dhm1l,Freakychee,2,Thu Jul 16 10:10:38 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make any sense. Miniaturized or not, he still goes Pew Pew Pew. Eitherway, it's a known bug as previously MODOK was a Combat type in the daily mission as well. So it just shifted from there to YJ, it ill be fixed eventually."
FutureFight,3dhm1l,Zephyraine,3,Thu Jul 16 11:02:19 2015 UTC,"And Bullseye goes ""Throw-Throw"" but still combat type.  Yondu whistles and zoops-zoops.  Spider-Man IMO be a combat type instead of speed even though he is quite speedy and Cap would be Universal.  Sometimes you don't need a completely rational explanation. Just one that satisfies OP's wonder.  Most likely it is as you say, a bug but if you really want another of my 2 cents and made up mumbo-jumbo. Here goes!  Yellow-Jacket's specials often incorporate melee moves into the mix so he can swing either way. With the change in arena and overall size he is more potent with his melee attacks than energy ranged attacks. Since they are most likely following the movie version where you are miniaturized you are just as strong but lighter where you can get washed away by water. (I seriously hope I didn't spoil any of the movie for you)  Anyway, that is all the BS I can manage today. The regulars at r/asksciencefiction could do better I suppose."
FutureFight,3dhm1l,Freakychee,3,Thu Jul 16 14:32:32 2015 UTC,"The ratio is the same though.  Large size in a large room has the same ratio as small size in a small room.  The circumstances may be different but as stated, the ratio is no different. Still the same amount of space."
FutureFight,3dhm1l,Spedwards,0,Thu Jul 16 11:04:43 2015 UTC,"Well yes, but don't forget that when shrunk you keep the same strength but lose overall weight (Seriously, that should not work that way at all) so even if the ratio is the same the impacts of the melee attacks are far more potent at that size hence the combat nature.  Just like how an ant or any other small insect can fall from the same height in ratio as me jumping off a skyscraper would be little.  And I base this off absolutely nothing but really... it is a video game, I never expected it to make perfect sense in the first place. :)"
FutureFight,3dhm1l,Freakychee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:37:59 2015 UTC,"Seems like Netmarble wants to help us farm and level up faster, easier and more efficiently (by using one strong character to sweep and two others just for the hero exp).

You'll want to increase her defence for alleviating the blows when they land and increase dodge to minimise the occurence of those blows landing.  For ISO-8 sets these are preferable:   Silent Night: boost to defence, dodge, attack speed, and crowd control (HP recovery) Animal Instinct: boost to HP, defence, dodge, and crit damage (shield) *The Sly One: boost to Hp, defence, attack speed, and dodge (15% defence boost)   Give her the dodge special gear and she becomes a very good DPS character that can dish it out and stick around to dish out some more if she can't safely retreat."

FutureFight,3dguyv,dantom04,4,Thu Jul 16 04:11:55 2015 UTC,"When you master a hero, you basically activate (when you first master it) or level-up his/her/its leadership bonus. For example, when you first master Ronan you will activate his leadership bonus which give additional % attack and % defense for Universal heroes. And when you assign him as the leader (when you put him at the middle position of your team) this bonus will carry on giving bonus to Universal heroes. The more you master a hero the higher the leadership bonus he/she/it gives to the members of the team. Mastering also gives additional status bonus. The first thing you should determine when choosing who to master is choosing who will be the leader of that team. Usually this translates to who will give the most benefit on his/her/its leadership bonus."

FutureFight,3dguyv,chmsax,3,Thu Jul 16 20:08:23 2015 UTC,"Mastery does two things - increases the rank of their leadership skill, and gives them a general stat boost across the board.  So whoever you are using as your primary leader you should definitely be maxing, and boosting your other mains quite a bit for the stat boost.  Whether you max them is up to you, it costs more and more as you increase mastery so it's a balance between having a large number of heroes with a small stat boost to help in Villain Siege or having a small number of heroes with very high stat boosts to help in Arena and Story mode."

FutureFight,3ddqqd,Blitqz21l,2,Wed Jul 15 17:44:59 2015 UTC,"I find Villain Siege to be the best judge of a character, as leadership skills, team bonuses, etc. don't come into play: it's just one-on-one. Pretty much any hero who's been sufficiently leveled can excel in Normal/Elite, and Arena is pretty unbalanced right now.   You've also put a great Spec gear on him which boosts most, if not all of his attacks, which most other characters don't have right now.  For example, if there were 42% Energy or Physical attack boosting Spec gears, Rider wouldn't hold a candle to any hero. And the gearing still doesn't fix his painfully slow base attack speed and movement speed. So for me, he's still lowest tier, but still, a bit better than, say, Blade and Black Cat."
FutureFight,3ddqqd,toysoldierxiii,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:03:36 2015 UTC,Leadership bonuses definitely work in Villain Siege. I use them quite regularly in fact.

FutureFight,3ddqqd,HankPymWillHitYoGirl,2,Wed Jul 15 19:02:55 2015 UTC,"I use GR without leadership, since his attacks are slow and burn a lot of time, so I don't want to burn a character for his benefit.

FutureFight,3ddqqd,ConcealedTerror,3,Wed Jul 15 19:09:16 2015 UTC,"Not really sure OP's reasons are legit.  Basically a fully decked out min/maxed Ghost Rider is able to actually do some decent damage.  And while that's all fine and good, what happens when he's put up against another hero who is fully min/maxed in the same catagory.  Most of the time, they'll wipe there ass on GR's corpse"

But for me, part of what's kept the game fresh is getting new characters and playing the ones I have the most fun with. I've been prioritizing my main two teams, getting them to 5 stars (only Venom is left), and now I'm focusing on a lot of the Ant Man characters cause they've been the most fun to play for me."

My criteria are economical, making my decision based on resources, i.e. from the rarest to the most common currency. So Arena, which provides you crystals, is essential. And as I think you can see, competition is getting stronger by the day so a core of 3 heroes to max out will be crucial to keep the pace.  Then comes VS, for which 5* is enough.  Finally you can just have fun with whatever character you like the most to develop."
FutureFight,3de6he,Woes_oh_noes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:09:58 2015 UTC,"I think if you want to maximize VS though, a couple of 6* heroes can't hurt.    I'd focus on some of the easier ones to get, as in YJ and GM, with Giant Man being the easiest 6* to power up, especially if you have a 5* to power thru tier 4.  if you think about it, it only takes about 2 weeks of work to get a GM to 6.  average of about 45ish for 2 unlimited runs + the 5 lead ups.  There should still be enough energy left over to focus on getting a heros elite bios and normals and rifts to build up their gear level as well.  Granted if you want to focus on rift debris and those bios, that's going to sap a ton of energy"

FutureFight,3ddrlx,_murq_,5,Wed Jul 15 15:32:41 2015 UTC,The cannon is a really consistent break and you can cancel out of the 3* skill in a set position with it.
FutureFight,3ddrlx,tegeusCromis,3,Wed Jul 15 15:56:13 2015 UTC,"Use his second skill, the anti-gravity device, then use the first skill, the Hadron Enforcer, and AoE a group of hooligans at the same time. They become dust while just standing there holding hands.  If things get too tight or he doesn't kite fast enough, skill 3 for a quick retreat, invincibility, and decent damage. By this time, 1 and 2 should be back up.  Also, they fixed his rate of fire, so he's faster now. I also put him on a team that increases his attack speed and get up over 117%, currently. That's not too shabby.  I've since added the Dodge special gear to him, and good luck taking him down during a mission. He hardly ever gets scratched with his kiting and mobility.

FutureFight,3ddrlx,OxideRenegade,2,Wed Jul 15 16:41:43 2015 UTC,"There's actually an interesting bug with the grenade. There's a lingering gravity effect that pulls in enemies if it wasn't initially triggered (i.e., if it missed initially). In effect, it's like an invisible trap.

FutureFight,3ddrlx,NexusKnights,2,Wed Jul 15 19:41:22 2015 UTC,"Star-Lord has to be one of my favorite characters in the game, his second skill is a grenade that pulls in mobs and the Hadron enforcer used in conjunction with it is devastating. His third skill is another great feature as it gives him invulnerability and allows him to get out of dodge fast. Finally his last ability obtained at 5* is essentially this shield throw that is on crack. If it hits a single target it will proc multiple times but with more it will devastate entire mobs. His passive wasn't that great at first but with the sudden increase in dodge thanks to that new gear, his 15% ignore dodge is great. His leadership is another great feature with up to 45% added energy damage for blast heroes he is an amazing team up with malekith, vision, iron man, war machine, or Yellow jacket."

FutureFight,3dd9xy,pigou26,6,Wed Jul 15 10:54:32 2015 UTC,For me it is Gamora. When compared to Spiderman she can dish out more damage output but you can not really compare them per se because Gamora is a more straightforward attacker compared to Spiderman who is more of a disabler. Also we should also take into account the existence of the 5th gear Web resist.
FutureFight,3dd9xy,CountHalphas,5,Wed Jul 15 11:49:58 2015 UTC,Gamora or Spidey and yes  (in my opinion)

FutureFight,3dd9xy,Nelfrey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:04:14 2015 UTC,I would say Gamora simply because someone can equip a web resist gear and destroy Spidey.

Why? 3 out of 4 venom skills break, 1 puts Fear effect on them, cooldowns aren't too long, his basic attack is superior to any other characters basica attack (He hits almost twice as much as ultron does), black panther seems squishy when I use him and his third skill misses a lot."

It's not the most hard-hitting, but all of them (except the fear-one) are multi-hits, making his Bloodthirst shield proc extremely often.  Also, I second your comment on his basic attack. It hits SO hard. With his 4th gear all rolled to crit rate and a 35% crit rate boost, 50% of his attacks are critical hits, and I can basically stand still spamming basic attacks, and still wreck bosses with no sweat. (All gear 12)  With that said, my BP is a 3-star, lv.40, and I really like him too. I can't wait to unlock his bleed passive."

FutureFight,3dd9xy,palmermarc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:30:44 2015 UTC,"Depends on what we're comparing.. My Gamora is only a 3* at level 40 with +9 gear and level 20 skills, and she can stomp a level 45 Destroyer in Villain Siege, my Spidey can't.

FutureFight,3dd9xy,ZoeJoK,2,Wed Jul 15 11:21:16 2015 UTC,How do you play her. It is because it seems like i hesitate too much and get greedy and get smashed by the destroyer
FutureFight,3dd9xy,palmermarc,4,Wed Jul 15 11:59:27 2015 UTC,"I'm terrible with skill names.. so this is going to be rough.  Start with the 3rd skill - The one that she jumps on the target and beats their a$$. Then, hit the first skill where she spends around them, then hit the 2nd skill. Once this ends, 3 is up again, so mash it.   Generally speaking, save your 2nd skill for dodging things against Destroyer. The only time I use it 100% for damage is on my first cycle because I know at the start of the level Destroyer is just going to throw fists.  Basically speaking, that's it. She does an insanely high amount of damage from skills, so dodge everything and don't be afraid to throw down when his skills are on cooldown."

FutureFight,3dd9xy,NGC2359,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:28:08 2015 UTC,"Falcon was improved with the GOTG update a bit, but people were still bashing on him because he was slow. But his uniform bonus obviously helps with the 10% across the board, but it also gives him an extra attack similar to a critical hit. Giving him the crit booster gear, an ISO-8 bonus that increases attack power, and his new uniform attacks all combined with the extra uniform ability and he can wipe the floor with a lot of people. The ability that replaces his shooting ability does a crap ton of damage really quickly, and the shield throw does more damage than Cap's throw, so even against a single target it isn't bad. He's fairly durable for a speed character, too."

And if you have VIP healing, bullseye becomes cake. Just trap him in a corner, use all skills, tag out, rinse and repeat.

To answer your question though. Unifrom Vision would be a good person to start farming/leveling up. A lot of people like Ultron, I don't use him much, but I have noticed. Ultron is a hard hitter. Yellowjacket is pretty beastly, I only have him at 3 stars but he's pretty amazing. I'd wait for a flash sale of a character you really want, of said characters, I'd spend money on Vision or Black Panther.  Of the characters you mentioned my team would compose of  Yellowjacket, Vision, Ultron/Black Panther."

FutureFight,3db9qq,MacStabby,3,Wed Jul 15 00:55:15 2015 UTC,I can't imagine that you still have 4m gold.. Do you just not upgrade skills and enhance ISOs?
FutureFight,3db9qq,goodnight_moonlight,3,Wed Jul 15 01:05:33 2015 UTC,I've been casually enhancing ISO's for the daily achievement or to clear up space. I told myself that I wont focus on it heavily till I reach shield level 50. I also dont really upgrade most skills beyond level 25.
FutureFight,3db9qq,pksullivan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:08:31 2015 UTC,"If you have rank, mastery etc all maxed why do you not take skills beyond lv 25 ? Especially if your character is lv 45 or 50 is it not potentially harmful not to in arena off course."

I've been finishing top 2-5% in the arena on an average week and top 1% on a good week. I know i cant break into the top 100 without using crystals so I just take the free crystals that i get and focus on building up my characters.    Gold, imo, is the hardest commodity to farm. I can easily blow through all my gold in a couple days if i wanted to max out my mains. There are other areas like the Lab that can drain you quite easily as well. For now, I'd rather rank my characters then focus on building their full arsenal when im ready."

FutureFight,3dcm2n,LegendFuryFF,-1,Wed Jul 15 05:38:11 2015 UTC,"Is your main team 5* at least? If not I suggest you just start working on that first, cuz without a strong team it'll just slow down your grinding and ability to clear missions with ease. If you do then all you need to do is just pick which characters YOU like to play with.  If you just want to know which characters are easier/more powerful/better tiers etc. then you'll probably want War Machine as he is the most top tier out of everybody that is in your list. War Machine has a Combo Attack with Vision and strikes for both characters in your secondary team.  But seriously, just pick whoever you want to play with. If you can't decide then go with what I said or go with whomever that has team bonus/combo attack."

Yes she does alright against bosses but that's her only trick and other heroes do the same thing better and have more versatility in other areas.  In VS she's really only good against Ronan since she's at a class disadvantage against the Doc and Bullseye and lightning doesn't work against Destroyer.  I'll probably keep grinding her to 6*'s but if I had to pick a hero to invest time into now it wouldn't be her. Her one nice bit is how early you can unlock all of her elite bio missions.   Were I just starting out and had to pick heroes to farm and build a hero pool I'd probably go with Vision, War Machine, and Spider-Man (based on ease if acquiring bios and high level viability). Ronan/Ultron would also be a good pick thanks to the addition of the new special missions, although really only if you've got a Uni Vision."

I only have a 3* level 32 Giant Man and he seems to be very good and another + for him it's that if you farm his bios daily in 2-3 weeks you should easily get him to 5*. Black Widow it's good, when I started it was kinda harder to get good speed chars and she helped me clear almost all bosses. Now I use her mostly for killing Ronan in VS... I think you can stick with these chars, but my advice is to try to get Vision ASAP, he's insane :)"

FutureFight,3dcwf1,pksullivan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:25:32 2015 UTC,"I think the reason you miss on the YJ mission is because Ant-Man pushes enemies around.

On the other hand leveling skills and gear never gets wasted. ISO-8 upgrades just seem so very expensive.  Do you have any advice on upgrading ISO-8? Should I use my 1* ISO-8 to enhance my 3* ? Or use the 2* to enhance my 3* and then just sell the 1* for gold since 2* costs just as much to use, but is more effective? On the other hand, I don't have nearly as many 2* ISO-8 to use. Are there any good guys that show cost effectiveness breakdowns of ISO-8 combining?  To go from +0 to +1 3* ISO-8 using 1* ISO-8 is 14000 gold and 5 ISO-8s. Do that up to +5 and it's 70000 gold. Now I need a second ISO-8 +5 to combine it with, so 140000 gold total and 50 1* ISO-8s. So after all that expense I have gone from 1 single 3* ISO-8 to a 4* ISO-8. I imagine it would take me from a +74 attack ISO-8 to a +83 attack ISO-8.  For the same exact amount of gold and no ISO-8 consumed, I can go from lvl 27 skills to lvl 29 skills. Is that +9 attack really better than the increase in skill levels?"
FutureFight,3dbs0e,coju3,2,Wed Jul 15 04:12:23 2015 UTC,"the amount of stats you get from your iso set goes up as well, the % values. For instance my mix of iso's in my bloodthirst gives me 4.2% max hp, 4.2% all attack, 4.2% critical rate, and 4% recovery rate. The higher the level of iso's you have equipped, the higher that % goes. Personally I doubt I'll ever go for an 8 iso set, unless they add new ones that are way better down the line."
FutureFight,3dbs0e,Extranationalidad,2,Wed Jul 15 04:27:36 2015 UTC,"Except on characters whose 6-slot ISO combo leads directly to an equally good or better 8-slot combo, I only generally use 3-star ISO-8. I rank it up to +5 and call it a day.  Level 12 gear is a pain in the butt slog all by itself, mostly because of the rapidly ramped-up costs of Dimensional Debris. If you're struggling to hit enough Rifts while farming missions, it's totally fine to leave gear at 10 or 11 for a while. My 5-star 5-mastered Vision only has 11/10/10/11 on gear and wrecks face.  You're right that gear and skills last forever while ISO is a bit of a crap shoot. With all that said, I think that once your 5-star characters are... strong enough, it does you more good to level backup characters for Villain Siege than to worry about perfectly optimizing a single character."
FutureFight,3dbs0e,Extranationalidad,2,Wed Jul 15 04:28:15 2015 UTC,"OK backup characters make sense. I still don't have any 5* characters and I'm at Chapter 7.3 in Elite, Chapter 7.8 in Normal, and doing Stage 6 (occasionally 7) in VS. I want to do better at all those things but I'm not sure where to put my efforts to do that."
FutureFight,3dbs0e,darxide23,2,Wed Jul 15 04:41:41 2015 UTC,"Speaking only for myself, I focused very specifically on getting 1 character to 5 stars, as that was a real breakthrough point; it let me farm level 4 Rifts, Daily missions and Specials on auto while I'm otherwise busy and powerlevel 2 characters at a time.  That character happened to be Ultron for me, and once I had him at 5, I noticed that in the normal course of my day to day farming I'd gotten both Kingpin and Vision fairly close to 5, and was starting to find that I could get through 20+ Nebula missions a day, and... well, it snowballs.  Once I had 2 5-star characters and a bunch of level 40s, Villain Siege suddenly went from ""a daily race to see if I'd have any characters left by the end of level 7"" to easily completing level 9 unless I really messed up, and those last two levels are more than 500 tokens a day by themselves, so that also really accelerates progress."
FutureFight,3dbs0e,crash100200,0,Wed Jul 15 04:49:08 2015 UTC,I agree with you except for the level 30 skills. Leveling skills is probably one of the last things you should worry about after everything else is taken care of. It's incredibly expensive and has very little noticeable impact on damage output.
FutureFight,3dbs0e,SageofLogic,3,Wed Jul 15 05:12:42 2015 UTC,"If you already have your favourites, MAX EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM. They'd perform way better in all modes of the game. Alternatively, if u like giant man then just level him up :D"
FutureFight,3dbs0e,toysoldierxiii,3,Wed Jul 15 03:00:59 2015 UTC,"Actually ""Screw all these guys and level up Giant Man"" isn't a bad idea. He is a great combat character. I have him 5* 45 and he's killing it. Since Venom is your only combat character that's good against bosses that would be a nice slot to fill."
FutureFight,3dbs0e,ConcealedTerror,2,Wed Jul 15 04:47:18 2015 UTC,Screw all of these guys and lvl up Giant Man   This.  Although to answer deeper gear then iso finishing touches (max enhance and combine) then skills over 20.
FutureFight,3dbs0e,sjohns0624,2,Wed Jul 15 01:25:34 2015 UTC,don't bother spending any more money on skills till you get everything else done. get your 5* skills to 25 and be done with it. Work on gears
FutureFight,3dbs0e,Blitqz21l,2,Wed Jul 15 03:30:09 2015 UTC,"Regarding my top 8 characters, 2 from each class...  MASTER THEM FIRST!!! I always make sure I have enough spare stones and gold to master any of my top guys as soon as they can rank up.  Personally, gears are my next top priority. Constantly farm any dimensional rift you see on easy. Do at least 5 or 6 a day and make it a habit. Get that gear to +12 ASAP!!  Skills are next. I like to get to at least level 35. It's expensive but a great investment that will be permanent.   ISO-8 I re-roll until I get a decent 6-shard set that I can use from now until my ""end game"". This is the only time I plan to roll so I want to make sure it is a good set that I like. Then I attach whatever 2* or 3* ISO-8 I have laying around just to get the bonus. At this point, all I want is the set bonus. Once the character is level 50, then I will focus on upgrading the 6 existing ISO-8 and I will have two extra slot to add whatever else I want.  Everyone else, level 'em to 40, boost skills to 20, gear to +5, slap whatever 1* ISO-8 is needed to complete the x3 shard set they started with, and line them up for cannon fodder in Villain Siege."

FutureFight,3dbtri,malohkan,3,Wed Jul 15 01:31:04 2015 UTC,I can finish it everyday without any 5* hero.  Having many 4* Lvl 40 heroes works better since you have better match up options.  I have 3 x 5* and 18 x 4* now and I can finish any set-up The first time i cleared it I had about 10 x 4*.
FutureFight,3dbtri,Ben882,3,Wed Jul 15 02:27:05 2015 UTC,best tip you can get.  use 1 hero at a time. this way the environmental hazard will always reset when you are using a new character giving you easy 20 sec damages.

FutureFight,3dbtri,BrainWav,5,Wed Jul 15 13:52:31 2015 UTC,4* level 40's are enough to beat all of VS through 9. It's more a matter of how well you control your characters and taking advantage of good matchups. It would be helpful if you listed what characters you have.

FutureFight,3dbtri,kaige,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:43:31 2015 UTC,"Try the following: 1. First of all, yes do not use 1-Touch. The joystick type is much better. You will be able to maximize controlling your characters. 2. Separate them into two (2) teams: first attempt Iron Man(L), War Machine then last attempt Vision solo. Vision can solo him, just avoid getting too much damage. 3. Strategy for Bullseye: Observe his attack patterns and try to dodge them. After dodging his attacks, carefully use the right skills. There is a delay between his attacks. Do not spam. Be patient and feel the rhythm. 4. Strategy for the spawning mobs: Once those mobs appear, your objective is to clear the map as soon as possible. This can be done by making them self destruct quickly.  After that, repeat #3. 5. Save and train Malekith to 3. My 3 L30ish Malekith can solo Stage 7 or Stage 8 Bullseye."

FutureFight,3dcae0,doughnut_glaze,2,Wed Jul 15 03:57:31 2015 UTC,"At this point in time if you want War Machine simply because he is a good Blast type, then I suggest you go for Yellow Jacket instead. This is because he is easier to farm compared to War Machine due to the Unlimited entries from special missions and Yellow Jacket is arguably better or equal to War Machine at this point of time. You can only get your maximum 9 tries of War Machine bios only if you managed to complete till the middle of Chapter 8 Elite which can be a long way to go if you're not there yet.  If you like War Machine and want to play him then nobody can stop you from farming him. However, if you are looking for more troops for VS/power/clear story then go with YJ.  Btw, if you hadn't noticed Yellow Jacket has 2 skills that grants invulnerability. His 2nd Skill and 3rd skill both does that. His first skill is for the break + burst damage. Basically, he is akin to Vision."
FutureFight,3dcae0,Zephyraine,2,Wed Jul 15 04:07:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for your advise. Btw should i concentrate on GM 1st? cos i heard it is easier to get him to 5*?
FutureFight,3dcae0,Zephyraine,2,Wed Jul 15 06:04:49 2015 UTC,"Really depends on what you need right now. Are you in need of immediate power for a 5*? Or do you just need more characters to be stronger? If the former, then Giant Man otherwise go with YJ or whichever special mission characters."

FutureFight,3dcae0,Zephyraine,2,Wed Jul 15 07:06:45 2015 UTC,"I guess if you do need to clear missions then Giant Man would probably be the way to go since you can get his Bios much faster than YJ. But it's up to you as YellowJacket is a godly character as well.  Well, perhaps this will help you make a decision too: You can get additional help to clear normal/elite missions by trying to get Ally Shifters to help. All you need to do is start the mission and hope for  an Ally Shifter, if you get an Enemy Shifter/no shifter at all, then press Pause and force close your game (Go back to Main homepage of your phone and use task manage to clear the game from memory). This step is done so that you will not lose any energy from the mission that you attempted. Repeat this until you get an Ally Shifter. Once you do, just kite the boss and attack only when it is safe to so do. Otherwise just let the Ally Shifter do the dirty work for you. You can clear all your normal/elite missions this way without even requiring extra heroes."

FutureFight,3dcae0,bobsponge933,3,Wed Jul 15 07:42:59 2015 UTC,There are no wrong choices in this game. Every character can be strong enough to take on the current in-game content by themselves once they are ranked high enough.

FutureFight,3dc1y1,toysoldierxiii,3,Wed Jul 15 02:49:17 2015 UTC,I personally prefer Yellowjacket simply for being blast. It helps having lots of blast characters in villain siege for those days when Bullseye and Doc Ock decide they want to swarm your high level duels.

FutureFight,3dc1y1,Kinrubich,3,Wed Jul 15 02:55:28 2015 UTC,I do YJ mostly because I'm halfway to 5* wasp. YJ being a beast of character especially in VS is just another plus for me. I took about 85% off of doc oc in VS with 3* YJ at level 30 all around lv5-7 gears and lv 10 skills. But giant man is easier to farm.

FutureFight,3dc1y1,ssj4ric,2,Wed Jul 15 03:38:00 2015 UTC,"Giant Man is going to be SIGNIFICANTLY easier to farm. You will get him up to 5* (or even 6) noticeably faster than you can get YJ there. Many people consider him very good, and if you don't already have enough 5 or 6* characters, then aiming for him would be a quick way to get a good one.  With that said, YJ is a stronger character. He is arguably at the tip of the Top Tier at the moment. If you also have an interest in either Wasp or Ant Man, then farming him will get you all three. Just be prepared... YJ is a lot slower of a farm than Giant Man. You won't get him to 5* any time soon unless you use both Unlimited Entries on him every single day... and have some good RNG luck as well."
FutureFight,3dc1y1,chaoticheartld,3,Wed Jul 15 03:18:44 2015 UTC,Not as bad as most make it out to be actually. You can get YJ at the same rate as GotG characters. It's Giant Man that allows you to get him faster simply due to 2X bios from his own shifting. Everyone else is at a normal rate.
FutureFight,3dc1y1,Zephyraine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:04:42 2015 UTC,"Also, the fact that the mission for Giant Man is the shortest of all special missions meaning you can squeeze even more runs in during the no limit time frame."

He's also pretty darn good. his attacks look really cool and he does good damage. Plus has a uniform to boost his stats.   I have Yellow Jacket 2🌟Lv.40 - collecting his bios takes a bit longer then Gman's but the extra bios of his you'd lose compared to Gman, you have a chance of either grabbing Wasp or Ant-Man as an ally shifter. I honestly love Yellow Jacket. I Issa him today In villain Siege and was able to get Lv.41 Ronan down to 6% health. And that him at only 2🌟. His skills are amazing, very ""burst"". But his auto attack is also great. It has a great shooting pattern, great range and good damage.

FutureFight,3d9x2g,toysoldierxiii,6,Tue Jul 14 17:18:36 2015 UTC,"I agree, dodge is so op and needs some adjustments. My spider-man with just 20% dodge can easily avoid most of damage and remains very healthy at end of higher level boss battles, I imagine how it would be at 40%+ dodge."
FutureFight,3d9x2g,Ileb,3,Tue Jul 14 19:15:03 2015 UTC,My vision with 44% dodge even dodges some lasers of doc oc villain siege. Lel.
FutureFight,3d9x2g,broodybear,3,Tue Jul 14 18:27:45 2015 UTC,I have 40% dodge for my Iron Man including the Gear and it definitely is OP
FutureFight,3d9x2g,MegaMohsi,2,Tue Jul 14 18:34:00 2015 UTC,"It may just be a coincidence, but I think defense penetration helps to ignore dodge as well. My Loki with 974 defense penetration is what I usually use to kill JI teams. His shield soaks up most of Spiderman's single hit skills and he rarely dodges the first skill. Also for some reason he doesn't seem to take too much damage from Marvel's energy reflect. I'm not sure if that is due to defense penetration or what. I have a cold booster on him btw, not ignore dodge."
FutureFight,3d9x2g,coju3,2,Tue Jul 14 17:52:20 2015 UTC,Captain Marvel's energy reflect just sucks -_-

FutureFight,3d9x2g,coju3,2,Tue Jul 14 18:33:57 2015 UTC,People are saying that ignore dodge is broken atm. Once it gets fixed then dodge will be less viable.
FutureFight,3d9x2g,Phil2512,2,Tue Jul 14 20:19:07 2015 UTC,"It seems to work if my hypothesis and testing is correct. It definitely procs and even gives a notification but the formula is wonky.  Regardless, even if ""fixed"" by making it a flat reduction Dodge can still reach 90% whereas Ignore tops out at 50%. Averaging one out of every two attacks missing is still insanely OP."
FutureFight,3d9x2g,Phil2512,2,Tue Jul 14 20:39:22 2015 UTC,Can agree with dodge being OP. A flat nerf to the dodge for all characters would be the best. The highest should be at least between 60% and 75%.
FutureFight,3d9x2g,ColorFromTheSun,2,Tue Jul 14 21:37:39 2015 UTC,Is it better to have the Dodge stat or HP stat on the third piece of gear for Spidey?
FutureFight,3d9x2g,akira117,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:54:30 2015 UTC,"The flat number dodge increases add very, very little to the % so I always go HP. However if you are really focused on a dodge build I suppose that extra 2-3% could help."

FutureFight,3d9x2g,Zephyraine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:01:04 2015 UTC,You the best! Thank you! I appreciate the clarification :)
FutureFight,3d9x2g,Pubtemp,2,Thu Jul 16 03:37:46 2015 UTC,I agree. Dodge is stupid and should be capped at 20% to 30%.  Stupidly overpowered.
FutureFight,3d9x2g,Pubtemp,2,Tue Jul 14 21:55:48 2015 UTC,Currently ranked between 11 - 20 in arena and i can confirm dodge is the gear on 99% of all characters. It has become the meta and makes other gear virtually useless. Dodge or die. Def. A nerf incoming.
FutureFight,3d9x2g,Pubtemp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:22:38 2015 UTC,"And to think that people once argued that Uniform Ultron beating Spidey in Autoplay Arena was no big deal. Spiderman's dodge % with the current setup gears is through the roof, so anyone who thinks that having a synastry advantage or Ultron's uniform = autowin when playing autoplay against a 6* spiderman with high dodge must be high on crack."
FutureFight,3d9x2g,ign-Dextr0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:42:58 2015 UTC,If dodge needs a nerf because it instantly gives a boost in dodge% then does it work the same for Ignore dodge? Does ignore dodge item instantly ignore dodge stats at the same rate ie. Dodge 25% vs Ignore dodge 25% break even? or Ignore dodge completely negates the dodge effect; i don't have one to tell the diff?
FutureFight,3d9x2g,chaoticheartld,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:39:51 2015 UTC,From my testing Ignore Dodge reduces opponents dodge stat by it's % rather than taking it's % off of it flatly.  Meaning someone rocking 70% dodge and I'm rocking 50% Ignore it makes their actual dodge 35%. We originally assumed it would be simply 70% minus the 50% but that doesn't seem to be the case.
FutureFight,3d9x2g,Thesparkone,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:12:27 2015 UTC,"if that's the case instead of asking for a nerf, asking for a buff on ignore dodge to match would be just the same."
FutureFight,3d9x2g,Thesparkone,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:20:27 2015 UTC,I did in the OP. However the problem is dodge can be stacked much higher than ignore so ignore would need a MASSIVE buff.
FutureFight,3d9x2g,Thesparkone,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:24:41 2015 UTC,"that's true, since we can roll gears for dodge, but not roll for ignore =\"
FutureFight,3d9x2g,Zephyraine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:46:30 2015 UTC,"yea, for beams, all hits should connect if the first hit make contact,  and ffs, why does dodge work during stun web or fear, crazy"
FutureFight,3d9x2g,Thesparkone,3,Tue Jul 14 19:14:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I disagree with beams. Part of their strength lies in how each hit is independent of the other. If we go with the ""if first hits, they all hit"", then we are also stuck with ""If first misses, then all miss"". Which means standing there like an idiot while a long beam animation finishes that has already missed.   Right now, even if part of a beam misses, you don't lose ALL damage potential from the attack as well as (and probably more importantly) it still being able to hit-stun your target. This is why multi-hit skills are more useful than single-hit. They take longer to animate, but the trade-off is superior safety and a guarantee of at least getting partial damage out of it."
FutureFight,3d9x2g,Zephyraine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:03:58 2015 UTC,Maybe Crashing Foot Falls needs a nerf?
FutureFight,3d9x2g,bobsponge933,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:55:09 2015 UTC,I could possibly see a case being made for that as it is the hardest hitting skill in the game but it also leaves you completely vulnerable to damage for 3-4 seconds and has no CC on it. From a DPS standpoint it is probably a wash compared to get over here into aether bolt or web shot into dual kicky thing.  I fail to see how that is relevant to this discussion though.
FutureFight,3d9x2g,Zyraz-,-1,Tue Jul 14 22:46:34 2015 UTC,You: Dodge is too strong and needs to be nerfed.  Me: Maybe the thing you've been boasting as being really strong needs to be nerfed.  Both sides can use dodge.
FutureFight,3d9x2g,Karzak85,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:15:23 2015 UTC,So you think the proper solution is to make every skill do one damage (to ensure the perfect balance you want) and everyone should stack dodge to 90% to make every single mission/arena/seige take 2 hours?  I pray to god netmarble doesn't heed your advice and turn this from a fun game into an awful abortion of a game.
FutureFight,3d9x2g,Zyraz-,-1,Tue Jul 14 23:48:56 2015 UTC,"Where did I say that? OP'd for Arena? Arena was simple before, so what's changed?"
FutureFight,3d9x2g,bobsponge933,3,Wed Jul 15 00:45:01 2015 UTC,You said both sides can use dodge. Implying that in order to counter someone's high dodge stat is to join in the bandwagon and use a high dodge gear as well and essentially even out the game by expecting everyone to use a broken mechanic so that it isn't broken anymore because everybody has godly dodge stats.  End result of all that are 2 characters essentially playing a game of dodgeball where whoever gets to hit each other more will win. Synastries and everything else will be meaningless if you can't hit the character.
FutureFight,3dcfmn,Ben882,8,Wed Jul 15 04:32:02 2015 UTC,"I can understand trying to boast character ranks, masteries, skill levels, ISO sets, % stats but what is the point of even sharing game account stats?

FutureFight,3dcfmn,TrackXII,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:51:05 2015 UTC,Just logged in Excel. It gives a general outlook. It also helps to calculate the ressources needed for gear upgrade.
FutureFight,3dcb85,sumseehippo,5,Wed Jul 15 03:53:19 2015 UTC,"Average.   Slow, damage is decent especially with fire gear, not tanky enough.   More or less Hulk level imho."
FutureFight,3dcb85,hou_f,3,Wed Jul 15 04:04:09 2015 UTC,"agreed, he suffers from pretty much the exact issues hulk does,  slow, long animations, semi high damage but not high enough to compete with god tier, and tbh hulks leadership ability is better (do you really want to run ghost rider to have a team that uses his leadership ability? i didnt think so)"
FutureFight,3dcb85,Malthan01,2,Wed Jul 15 08:40:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I have been readying reviews on both hulks and honestly. They are two out of 3 of my second team. They are 4 and 3 stars, and honestly not maxed at all. I gave them 3 to 4 star ISO-8 combinations and they tanks they destroy and I never half to worry about them. I will say this, early off sure very squishy. However the more. Ranks they get the more unstoppable they become. They team up attack I have watch take health to 0% in second from one attack. Sure animation isn't fast butbibwouldnt say slow. If you read any of the details on them. You will find that attack speed is one of their top 5 traits. Meaning I at least buff that a little bit through gears and upped their physical attack and my god. It's almost not fair. They can solo all they way to 8-1 or 8-2 on auto attack at 3 and 4 stars all masters. So idk. I really enjoy my hulks they do have downsides but that is definitely fixable. Besides its a game based on enjoyment. If you don't like it so what pick a different character. There are 50 to Chiose from. Play how you like to play with whom you like to play. For me punisher, venom, ghost rider are my team 1 hulk, red hulk and vision are my second team. Because I like them so I play with them. Sure probably not the best for player vs player but that's what I'm saving team 3 for, either pvp or their mmo team up coming later this month.    EDIT: by not maxed I mean their gear isn't maxed out and their skills are not as well. However it is very close to being maxed."

None of my non-energy characters can seem to do enough damage to kill him in time.  Some of my combat characters seem especially ill-suited, like Hulkbuster (slow, gets hit by his attacks and fire constantly), or Captain America (his strength is auto attacks, and he gets pummeled while doing so).  I have to usually throw several at him to bring him down like Venom, Black Panther, Hulkbuster, Giant Man, just to keep chipping away at him.  Do I just have to keep juicing up certain characters like BP to really high gear/ISO/mastery/skill levels?  They're all pretty much +9 or +10 gears, 6 ISO sets, 20-22 skills, etc.  What do you guys use?"
FutureFight,3d9uvm,mainecoonmix,3,Tue Jul 14 19:39:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for me Destroyer is the hardest to solo, because of his huge amount of HP, he's not vulnerable to anything and he's inmune to my best dps: Vision.

FutureFight,3da2jr,FalsyB,4,Tue Jul 14 17:55:36 2015 UTC,"Are you running Arena (don't forget Revenges) and Villain Siege too?  Those a good steady source of bios.    I've noticed that with this game, your initial advancement is very slow.  There's two reasons.  Your energy is very limited at first.  As you gain more SHIELD levels, you'll gain more total energy, up to 100 at level 50, IIRC.  More energy means more ability to grind.  Second, as you gain more heroes and level them up, you'll have a much easier time auto-running things for bios and stones.  More heroes means more bodies to throw at Villain Siege fights.  Here's what I did, and what I'd recommend.  Start doing Arena, pick fights you know you can win (protip: Vision and Spider-man are deceptively strong in Arena).  Even if you lose, you'll still get some tokens though.  Use these to work toward more heroes.  Captain Marvel's price is a bit steep, but she's great in the mid-game, and still decent later (and this is the only way to farm her).  Gamora is supposed to be amazing too (I haven't bothered to get her yet though).  Meanwhile, do VS too, even if you can only do the first few fights, the tokens will add up.  Meanwhile, just work on pushing further in the story mode.  You'll get access to better grinding spots and more bios.  Try to plan around your SHIELD level increases too, you'll get a full refill.  Remember that Clear Tickets won't give you SHIELD XP, so if you're going to level it up soon, burn some tickets then run missions normally to level up your SHIELD level.  Also, remember to get a full friends list, as those Assemble Points can be used to buy energy too.  Edit: Forgot to mention, make sure to do your daily achievements when you can.  Specifically, the Arena one gives you energy while not making you spend any."
FutureFight,3da2jr,BrainWav,2,Tue Jul 14 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  Yeah the early game part makes sense.  I have been doing the arena for the lask week and i did not know you got points even for defeats. I didn't do revenges because they were a lot stronger than me but i will do it from now on.  I have 21 cap marvel bios and will unlock her shortly. Her bios are only on the arena i guess? Seems a long way to 4 star marvel.  I am working on star-lord on VS i can only do 3 on VS but i feel like i can make it 4 with the right combo.  Thanks for the tips!  EDIT: Another quick question: I am really low on norn stones and when i am doing specials i cant farm them. How do you deal with that?  And i dont put much focus on the Dimension Rifts because they consume so much energy,but should i just enter if i see one?"
FutureFight,3da2jr,BrainWav,3,Tue Jul 14 20:14:06 2015 UTC,"I combined my early bio farming with stone farming.  I'd focus on bios where the level also offered stones I needed.  I wouldn't worry too much about Mastery early-on.  Marvel does take a while to 4-star, but the main thing is that working on getting her up there consumes no resources.  Your other option is, of course, to unlock other heroes with Honor Tokens.  Either way, it'll help.  Unless you really want someone, or a special gear, from a specific rift, I'd avoid them at your stage.  Too much energy to be useful."
FutureFight,3da2jr,jayknot,3,Tue Jul 14 20:21:47 2015 UTC,"Agree with your tip on dimensions rifts. They consume way to much energy. I'm honestly saving those for end game when those characters bios are all that left to collect. Otherwise I run a couple stages when I need the gear drop and that's is. 20 energy for one run??? Pffff and that with no grantee on any bios, gear, or basically anything you want. So yeah an expensive gamble not worth making. I'm shield level 50 with 100 energy and it's still not worth it lol."
FutureFight,3da2jr,pksullivan,2,Wed Jul 15 09:38:26 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately you'll just sort of have to pick to either farm for Norn stones and a few bios or do the specials for a lot of bios. For Norn stones, focus on your main team. Upgrading gets expensive really quick; you won't be able to afford to give everyone mastery.   Dimension Rifts are important for a few reasons. First, they can give you biometrics for a few key heroes like Spider-Man and Vision, speeding up your progression with them. Second, they give you Dimension Fragments, which are needed to upgrade gear on heroes past level 9. Lastly, the newest update gave us the Special Gear and the rifts are the only place to get them. They can be quite powerful and a real boon to your team."
FutureFight,3da2jr,Blitqz21l,2,Tue Jul 14 20:29:42 2015 UTC,"in terms of arena, always pick teams you can beat.  At the end of the week it means crystals.  In terms of grinding levels.  I wouldn't worry about that too much.  Levels will come as you run through stuff.  What I do, and did, was grind for the stuff that I needed.  Whether that's specific elites for BW bios, or the mats they need for gear upgrades.  And while this might not maximize xp, it will help you maximize gear and mastery which makes your heros stronger and able to do more difficult levels.  I would concentrate on 3 mains for the time being and picking your favorit to try and grind out their bios every day.  I understand at early levels, you do have a lot less energy to go around, so plan wisely.  Also, plan out your crystal usage.  Don't waste them.  I've made the mistake of spending them on some stupid stuff, Hulk, Angela are 2 examples that I wish I could take back.  Personally, at your level, I'd definitely grind Giant Man.  His bios are easy to get, and easy to get a 3* and even 4.  He's also a beast.  Hit's hard and his moves are quick. He destroys Destroyer in VS.  At 4 40, I took Destroyer down 55% on level 9 today before I ran out of time.  Thats crazy considering the 12 level difference."
FutureFight,3da2jr,pksullivan,2,Wed Jul 15 00:15:52 2015 UTC,"I've been playing since global launch and I only got 5 star heroes a couple weeks ago; that's with spending some cash on Tony's Stash and for some crystals early on to get a package with War Machine. Been close to three months for me. My current main team is War Machine 45/5/4, Groot 45/5/2, and Spider-Man 40/4/4.   The heroes you can farm in the special missions are really on an accelerated pace for ranking up. I got Groot to 5 stars pretty quick. Unlocking the Guardians and Ant-Man characters took a day or two of focused effort each time (aside from Gamora and Star-Lord, who can only be gotten through the Honor/Chaos shop). My Giant Man should be 5 star in another day or so. After that I'm going to focus on Ultron (26/2/0) and Ronan (38/3/3) to build up a strong universal team with UniVision (40/4/2)."
FutureFight,3da2jr,pksullivan,2,Tue Jul 14 18:22:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! Yea i will be focusing on Ant-man missions to grind. I have spider man but he has only one mission to farm(maybe two not sure) and it feels like 2-3 bios a day would take a long time. But patience is the name of the game i guess.
FutureFight,3da2jr,chmsax,3,Tue Jul 14 20:11:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Spider-Man has three Elite missions for farming and a Dimension Warp, but that's random. Patience definitely is the name of the game. Thankfully there's the autoplay feature. Takes the pain out of the grind."
FutureFight,3da2jr,pksullivan,2,Tue Jul 14 20:20:29 2015 UTC,"Grinding the ant-man missions is the best way - Giant Man looks like he'll be really, really quick to 3* and 4, considering you can usually get a bunch of bios in a 10-run day. I bought the ""created ones"" pack close to launch, which gave my 3 Ultron and Vision and Destroyer, and ground out Ultron to 5* and Vision to 121 bios in the subsequent six-ish weeks.  Ultron and Modok should be quick, too, considering that they're available as bios from the Ant-Man missions."
FutureFight,3da2jr,pksullivan,2,Tue Jul 14 20:57:24 2015 UTC,"yeah,giant man is really easy to farm since he is both the boss reward and an ally shifter. I could not get much from ultron special mission though and thought maybe because he has bios in elite? or just pure rng?(my sample size is only one day and i got 4/10 running level 3 difficulty)  And even though it writes in the rewards,the last ant-man mission with modok never gave me ultron bios. It seems like i will stick with giant man because i can don level 40 in short time thanks to the ally shifter."
FutureFight,3da2jr,Blitqz21l,2,Tue Jul 14 21:02:44 2015 UTC,Try to run tier 4 special missions if at all possible. That's where the drop rate goes to high. 4/10 sounds about right for medium. High I see 7/10 frequently.  Edit: I'm sitting at 153/160 for Giant Man bios. I'll do one more day to get a decent start on 6 stars (should wind up with a little more than 40/320 or so bios) then I'm switching to Ultron and Ronan.
FutureFight,3da2jr,chmsax,2,Tue Jul 14 21:08:51 2015 UTC,Did you buy any packages or that was just pure farming? If yes what is your tactic?
FutureFight,3da2jr,chmsax,2,Tue Jul 14 21:33:43 2015 UTC,"No package for Giant Man. Just pure farming, plus a few random bios in VS and the away mission things in the Lab.   Here's a guide I wrote on how to farm the special missions. It's written about the Guardians characters, specifically Groot, but applies to Giant Man with a few caveats.   First: Giant Man always shows up as a shifter in his special missions. This means you get his bios at a ridiculous rate, even though special mission shifters don't have a 100% drop rate. I've been getting over 50 bios a day farming him. Second: His mission is shorter than the Guardians levels so I'm able to get 15-17 runs in half an hour. The energy cost can be pretty demanding, so plan accordingly.  https://www.reddit.com/r/FutureFight/comments/3avlof/farming_the_guardians/"
FutureFight,3da2jr,Trunksshe,2,Tue Jul 14 22:34:14 2015 UTC,"I'm also going to with Giant Man for the time being.  Too easy to get bios.  Definitely going to get him to 5* in a couple of days.  84 away, so be an easy 2x unlimiteds per day.  Only tactic I switch up on is I run tier 5 non-unlimited, and tier 4 in umlimited.  plan for 17 and hope for the best.  I think it has more to do with server connection and load times than time thru the level.  Afterwards, I'm focusing on YJ to 3 or 4 stars (haven't decided yet), and then GM to 6.  Then go back to Guardains and push Groot to 5, then Ronan to 5.  Though I might switch it up and push Modok to 5* as tier 5 in Ant-man has Vision shifters rarely."
FutureFight,3da2jr,Trunksshe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:04:55 2015 UTC,"I've been giving a little bit of thought to ranking up Modok more than the 3-star he currently has with me, so getting one of Modok or Ultron is okay by me. I'm not in a rush - my attention has been mostly taken by Giant Man and Red Skull right now - but it's a thought."

When it's on point (and trust me, you'll know when it is)--it is probably the most damaging skill in the game. Too bad it's not always consistent.   When certain hits of Aether Bolt fail to connect for whatever reason (i.e., dodge, poor positioning, etc.), you lose out on maybe 2/3 - 3/4 of its true damage potential."

FutureFight,3daenz,Kinrubich,0,Sat Jul 18 13:31:29 2015 UTC,"Try clipping with his skill moves, You will find it more enjoyable when playing that way. Example, Skill 3 and 1, Skill 2 and 1 or Skill 2 and 4. Tap any skill move right after Skill 2, he will swoop down the enemy but deals no damage however, this way you can get close enough to deal massive damage with Skill 1, Also you can instantly use Skill 2 right after.  Edit: Defense and health are his weakest point. And imo he should be universal type villain."

Basically, since there's no time limit running tier 5 nets better xp and probably more bios.  But with limited time, with tier 4, I can blow thru a full energy bar in half an hour, and do 15-17 runs.  Using a 5* fully mastered UVision.  That way I can power 2 heroes up at the same time.  Time difference was huge, about 2 mins to do the tier 5, and 1min to do tier 4.  Granted it's the between time thing that adds up the most and that's how you get the run numbers."

FutureFight,3d9343,theorycl,3,Tue Jul 14 14:51:06 2015 UTC,"Since no one has answered you, his 5* is amazing. It's similar to Caps Shield throw but it hits solo targets three times. Get another enemy nearby and it absolutely melts health.  He's great against Doc Ock for his dodge, save it til you see lasers firing up then hit it. It has invuln frames at the beginning so the lasers will go away.  For bullseye, group him with those pesky boys and hit him with the ultimate, pretty much GG for that nerd.   For Ronan, just hit and move. Star-Lord hits hard and it won't take long. :)"

Wondering what skill they could possibly add to Star Lord. Would be cool if he calls the Milano in for an air strike--but then again, Sharon and Yondu have some similar already."

I have her now at 4* and getting closer to 5* I couldn't wait till the next update and WASP turned to be really good in villian siege against dr.oc and ronan I really love her
FutureFight,3d9343,Vermiuki,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:00:31 2015 UTC,You want Star Lord.  I expect that he will be removed from the shop after the next shop rotation to make room for the next exclusive character paired with upcoming Special Missions and become Dimension Box only similar to Angela and Black Cat.  Pure theory though.  Star Lord can downright solo Doc Oc.

FutureFight,3d90xc,dearbluey,6,Tue Jul 14 14:50:53 2015 UTC,Until they fix it the last played time reflects the last time they logged out so if they have had the game on for long periods of time either in the background or foreground you may get an inaccurate read on the amount of time they are playing. I would recommend 2 days rather than 1 until/if the last played time is updated in realtime.
FutureFight,3d90xc,Gpaint,2,Tue Jul 14 14:18:13 2015 UTC,Ah that makes sense. I tend to leave the app on all the time on my phone so I probably look like i'm being really inactive or something.
FutureFight,3d90xc,tom641,2,Tue Jul 14 15:15:11 2015 UTC,luckily the crashing should make the number fairly accurate.

Sometimes the game freezes for a second (when I'm outside of a match), but then within 5 seconds or so goes back to normal. Sometimes happens when I'm switching between FF and other apps.   I also keep all of my apps closed when I'm not actively using them. Mostly because I'm OCD about it. I usually have like 3 apps opened at once max. So that may be helping."

FutureFight,3d90xc,Vexxunite,3,Tue Jul 14 15:08:28 2015 UTC,The Alliance I am in warns their members after a 24h absence. 6 Hours later you get a second notice. And 6 hours after that you get kicked. It's a fair system. Gives others the time to respond/explain.

If you got the crystals to spare, then I say why not?   Earlier I got offered the United Colors package and I bought it purely for Black Cat bios.   Just depends on how many crystals you got and whether you're willing to 'waste' them on a hero you aren't focusing on."
FutureFight,3d9xbo,BossBattleE,2,Tue Jul 14 17:23:03 2015 UTC,I take any Bios offers for Angela I can get. She's only available from daily Shifters so you'll get 1-2 bios a day if you're lucky.  She's really strong and can be paired up with Ronan so worth it imo.
FutureFight,3d9xbo,Eselgee,2,Tue Jul 14 17:29:07 2015 UTC,Angela is a super high dps character. Gear her up for dodge and she becomes much harder to take down. She's just below Malakith in dps (I think). She's part of my main team for arenas so I buy as many as I can when her flash sale appears.
FutureFight,3d9xbo,Nelfrey,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:29:41 2015 UTC,thanks all for your opinions.I just bought it. I put my 5 red stars Hulk as leader in the group with 5 red stars Gamora and Angela (since Gamora is very good and she has bonus with Angela and Hulk). I also took advantage of 25% bonus of Physical attacks (for Gamora and Angela) from Hulk's leadership. The team is fun to play. Netmarble should give one whole team bonus for 3 characters

FutureFight,3d7gmp,theorycl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:37:45 2015 UTC,"I'll confess I'm way too lazy to do this but if I may give my Doc Oc strategy. Use Black Widow. I know she's got the character type disadvantage but her skills inherently own Doc Oc on Villain Siege.   It's simple, wait for him to charge, when he gets just outside of range do the flip back, guns thing. Doc tends to use his spin move attack and stays in one spot. Then use BW's energy attack and add in the dodge boost ability as it comes. Then just dodge lasers. If you get the timing down, by the time DO is done with the after effects of BW's energy attack, your cool down is ready and you just wait till he comes, back flip guns and energy attack and dodge lasers again. I can usually beat the level 41 DO with my level 40 BW without ever being touched.  I don't have BW up to 5* rank so I don't incorporate her other ability into this.   Just thought I'd share."

He's pretty decent against Ronan and Destroyer, since he's got a couple high damaging break skills, and the shield toss at the end which comes with a step-back.  Against Doc Ock and Bullseye, he's still great to use. But I docked a point because of type weakness    Black Panther  I have to disagree and give my boy 5 all around. Played correctly, there is no boss BP can't absolutely destroy. His 5-Star skill has a long animation, but when you use it last in your rotation, the timing is just right in that you can start up your cycle again right after it--effectively chaining up to 7 skills before running away. It also acts as if BP is off-screen, so it interrupts any boss skill and keeps him safe from damage.  His bleed passive contributes tons of damage (about 3.5K per tick for me) while you're running away waiting for your skills to refresh.   Only problems I've ever had with BP is against Blast type bosses of much higher level, where the fight becomes more of an endurance/patience test than anything."

FutureFight,3d71yr,Zephyraine,2,Tue Jul 14 02:36:37 2015 UTC,"Nah, additional hero characters and additional game modes/special missions should be only way to expand the game and not the ranking system. For instance, if they add a Boss Raid mode where all players join and try to fight and chip away at a Boss with ridiculous amount of health, that would be better compared to just making 7* or 8* characters. There are plenty of ways to improve the game without touching the ranking system, just depends on how lazy the developers are. Netmarble isn't one of them so far."

FutureFight,3d71yr,OxideRenegade,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:03:47 2015 UTC,"I just don't agree with this statement, just adding onto stuff is great and all but eventually you have to continue the story and increase the level cap down the road or they will start to lose people, so they will have to start thinking about ways to go about it, and increasing the rank count will probably eventually happen if you want this game to last longer than a year or so, unless the reinvent it"
FutureFight,3d71yr,EXZonic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:08:02 2015 UTC,"Down the road, it's more story and more characters as Netmarble has announced at SDCC and it's also the right way. Why would anyone request for a raised level cap and 7* characters when the game currently doesn't even cater to 6* characters? Let's face it, 6* characters just plows through every single in-game/story content there is now, including Villain Siege which is supposedly the hardest part of the game. Adding 7* and above is only going to give players with an Obsessive Compulsive Syndrome more headache and ordinary players a temporary sense of 'Gotta Catch Em All' before they hit another level cap wall and the game became even easier than before."
FutureFight,3d71yr,Blitqz21l,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:21:58 2015 UTC,"I agree. Kinda why I think selling bios is not a good choice.  They'll have to increase the level cap at some point, so holding onto bios is a wise choice, IMO.  I would think though, that if/when they do, they'll have to provide a different way to get bios as 640 would be insane, esp in the current system, other than the special mission way.  The story is designed as pretty open ended too, so there are tons way ways to extend the story."
FutureFight,3d71yr,Zephyraine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:43:55 2015 UTC,"I can understand wanting more story and having story expansion in the future. However, I really don't think a level cap increase is necessary not even for difficulty or mastery/collecting purposes. You can always have a mode that is tailored specifically for mastered 6* characters with perhaps additional gears or dare I even say, exclusive unlockables? The mode can be made so difficult that you need not just 6* characters but the way characters play, synastry, specific gear setups etc. just to beat the level. And the reward could be say a rare ISO or perhaps even an unlockable costume based on RNG.   I'd say that's refreshing enough. Harder game mode with rewards that could be exclusive to just that mode (I won't say crystals because crystals are somewhat easy to get/buy). Raising the level cap is just counterproductive because there's no end to it and it will also come to a point where they have to add harder missions to match the newer levels.  Currently, the game is too easy for end gamers with 6* characters all over. All you need is a harder mode where you can actually put the 6* characters to test. For starters, maybe an even harder villain siege? No not with lasers, but perhaps with 2 bosses at once. Maybe not, but I'm just spitballin' here."

FutureFight,3d71yr,Zephyraine,0,Tue Jul 14 10:17:30 2015 UTC,"Have u played Brave Brigade? It is a mobile game as well and the raids in that game is what im thinking of. Basically, you will fight a giant boss witg HP that is synced throughout the server but the bossfight is done by single player. You can only attempt number of times and he HP of the boss will reduce depending pn all players' attacks on him. Rewards will be given through participation and ampunt of damage dealt. In that way its win win for everyone and nothing to be unfair about. Im not retarded enough to imagine a full scale MMORPG raid for a game like this lol."

I stand on my point, adding raids to this game is a very bad idea and will make many people leave out of not being able to participate on them."
FutureFight,3d71yr,Zephyraine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:25:35 2015 UTC,"I think you're taking it abit too far with regards to raiding being the sole reason for playing this game and to make your point. I know what your point is, and the freezes occur due to the latest patch which is already being ninja patched this morning. If you read the previous thread where Spedwards asked me the same question about being resource intensive for any player-player interaction modes, I agreed. But if you haven't seen Brave Brigade's raid mode whre ONLY the HP data gets synced while everything is single player and all it costs is just energy to participate with the rewards being given based on participation + damage dealt, then I think you're disagreeing with an entirely different raid mode in mind.   Again, I do not expect a 12 player real time raid play. That's just too ambitious for a mobile game. And I think we're getting a little sidetracked here, my main point is that having 7* and 8* rather than expanding the game modes is just a bad idea because that is just a temporary solution for additional grinding material. It is very akin to the failed  MMORPG RO2 where they added 50 extra levels but made the current content of the game useless due to everyone being super over leveled. Seriously guys, do you want a game that is already easy, made EASIER?"

The whole game revolves around the concept of completing specific missions to get specific bios. If you were expecting to just trade random bios for bios you want you can only blame yourself. It's the same thing as expecting to buy premium items with the free currency.. won't happen.  In any game this kind of trade always costs you an arm for an uncertain result. Be happy the converter doesnt ask you crystal for the operation.  It will be smart to use it if you have bio of a character who has reached the level cap but one would always want to be safe and save it for a potential level cap raise.."

FutureFight,3dak3i,Malevolent_Web,2,Tue Jul 14 20:41:59 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see some fine-tuning on all of the labs stuff. Most of it feels like a place for high-level players to dump their money and Bios of Ghost Rider for a few extra tasks and a shot at EXP and Bios. I'm not buried in gold or unwanted bios, so there's not much draw for me in the lab. I got the AM Generator to Level 5, but level 6 is an unreasonable amount of gold for the boost. I don't use the Dimension Shop at all, and I left the Warp Device and Bio Converter at level 1. I have yet to spend any bios in the converter.  I'm wary about investing any time, gold, or actual money in the labs until it gets vetted by the players."
FutureFight,3dak3i,Thesparkone,3,Tue Jul 14 20:50:26 2015 UTC,"What needs to be vetted about the Warp Device? You trade AM for random bios. Mine is lvl 5 which is 6 missions and I'll be able to level it up soon, which will be 8 missions. So, that'll be 8 random bios a day, and from what I've been seeing it's giving a bunch of good bios.   What are you using your AM on if you're not upgrading anything? Why have it sit when you could be using it to get bios?"
FutureFight,3dak3i,Malevolent_Web,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:10:54 2015 UTC,"In general, the whole labs needs a few high-level money-spending players to max it out and see if it's worth the investment. That player is not me. I use the AM and run the Warps, but I'm not stockpiling AM like you suggest. Even getting the Warp to the next level is something like 7000 AM and I haven't collected that much yet."
FutureFight,3dak3i,Thesparkone,2,Tue Jul 14 22:20:46 2015 UTC,"Of course it's worth investing in. How much to invest depends on how far along you are. If you can beat all of the elites and stage 9 of VS, then you can much more afford to stockpile your gold to level up the AM Generator. If you can't, then you're better off using your gold building your characters up.  7,000 AM is nothing. My next upgrade requires 37,600 AM, which I'm hours away from."
FutureFight,3dak3i,yamiprem,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:30:47 2015 UTC,I have the Generator at LV 10. I'm not touching it anymore mainly cause I don't even know what to spend the AM on...
FutureFight,3dak3i,ArekkusuRin,2,Tue Jul 14 21:51:24 2015 UTC,the converter is terrible because its always a lose lose situation regardless of what bios you use to covert; giving up 2 for 1.
FutureFight,3dak3i,toysoldierxiii,2,Tue Jul 14 20:59:50 2015 UTC,Only if the cost didn't go up every level. Get it to max and you'll only be able to afford one or two per day completely defeating the purpose.
FutureFight,3dak3i,PorkBunGuy,2,Tue Jul 14 21:48:25 2015 UTC,How do you get 30 unwanted bio a day?
FutureFight,3dak3i,Extranationalidad,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:04:19 2015 UTC,Giant man special mission.  XD
FutureFight,3dak3i,Zephyraine,7,Mon Jul 20 19:35:50 2015 UTC,"This thread couldn't possibly be any less useful than the bio converter.  Do you have it maxed out? How much does it cost per transformation? How have you put it to use? What have your results been?  It's a costly -- and at face value, very low RoI -- upgrade that very few people have finished, so if you have contributions, it would be cool if you would actually make them rather than offering vague leading questions in a passive aggressive fashion."
FutureFight,3dak3i,Extranationalidad,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:11:34 2015 UTC,Well I have put up a theory now. :/
FutureFight,3dak3i,malach1constant,3,Tue Jul 14 20:48:52 2015 UTC,Its simply not worth the investment now whether at max or low level. Anything that RNG specific Bios into random Bios is just bad no matter how you look at it. It doesnt matter if u had 1000 bios of a 6 star character. That is still better than exchanging it for some random bio of a character that you may not even use ever. What's more is that the cost to convert increases with level....
FutureFight,3dak3i,BobbySmithGang,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:10:04 2015 UTC,"You're paying to upgrade the converter; plus paying to convert; plus spending 2 bios for every 1; for a chance to possibly get bios that you want.  On a very good day, there won't be any 'bad' outcomes, in which case yes, you're trading useless resources for useful ones. However, generally speaking, you're going to have most days offer you a 20%-60% chance to get something useful, and if you fail, then you're looking at exchanging 4:1 or 8:1 over subsequent attempts. At 4:1 or worse I'd almost always rather rank up ""useless"" characters, even without taking the presumably very high cost of late stage converter upgrades into account."
FutureFight,3dak3i,Malevolent_Web,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:33:21 2015 UTC,"I'm liking the biometric converter to be honest. I don't know about max level, but the last couple of days I've had good sets and managed to convert some less useful bios into War Machine, Black Cat, Captain Marvel. Today's set isn't great, but I can see that and opt out on days where the options don't look all that appealing."
FutureFight,3dak3i,zaShadow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:11:46 2015 UTC,Doesn't it give you a random character when you convert 2 Bios? I personally don't understand the super usefulness of it.
FutureFight,3d8rok,thirstykenny,5,Tue Jul 14 11:42:56 2015 UTC,yes... yes it is
FutureFight,3d8rok,Karzak85,5,Tue Jul 14 11:44:48 2015 UTC,Any character is worth being 6*
FutureFight,3d8rok,SenpaiSpadesz,2,Tue Jul 14 12:03:44 2015 UTC,the 6* skills are amazeballs
FutureFight,3d8rok,Zyraz-,2,Tue Jul 14 11:48:42 2015 UTC,"All characters will probably get a 6* skill eventually, BTW."
FutureFight,3d8rok,tegeusCromis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:26:42 2015 UTC,"It's worth it, yes. But I wouldn't go out of your way unless you absolutely love that character.  To me, 6* is something I'll get to eventually by just general grinding and achieving bios over the course of the game. While I am actively ranking Star-Lord to 6, he's one of the heroes I truly want to be a 'main' for me.  Otherwise, I'd rather work on getting everyone else to 5, then start the process of ranking them up from there."
FutureFight,3d8rok,BossBattleE,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:28:51 2015 UTC,"Just curious because I don't spend much on this game - how do you get Star-Lord bios?  Obviously he's now available for tokens, but short of spending cash, is there a solid option for heroes that don't have Elite missions?  I love Thor, but since it's damn near impossible to earn bios I'm ready to give up on using him.  Thanks for any advice!"
FutureFight,3d8rok,Hogs-o-War,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:53:57 2015 UTC,"I get 9 bios a day cause of the tokens. Outside that, it's flash sales. Been working on him since he was posted.  Thor is a pain yeah. Dimension shifts aren't worth the energy, but there isn't a more reliable way. Unless you got crystals to burn and you can reliably run his level 5 rift, you can't get him often outside the 1 Elite mission."
FutureFight,3d8rok,BossBattleE,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:01:29 2015 UTC,"Once I finally have a team strong enough to get to that mission, I'll probably farm that.  LOL"
FutureFight,3d8rok,Hogs-o-War,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:32:53 2015 UTC,It's shame to asking that.
FutureFight,3d8rok,IKADIXA,0,Tue Jul 14 11:57:15 2015 UTC,"i think you should rephrase the questions to which one to 6* first....as all heroes are worth 6*, it's just that the amount of time to do it is quite long....then you should select specific ones to focus on first rather than all at the same time."
FutureFight,3d9ezi,Karzak85,4,Tue Jul 14 15:11:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my YJ is pretty much a monster also."
FutureFight,3d9ezi,palmermarc,3,Tue Jul 14 15:21:13 2015 UTC,"My YJ is only 2 star, about level 22 or so. And he singlehandedly DESTROYED Doc Ok in VS, of a much higher level. It was incredible. I had no idea what I was doing either as it was basically the first time I'd used him  He is a beast, clearly"
FutureFight,3d9ezi,y2fitzy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:36:53 2015 UTC,what's your build?
FutureFight,3d9ezi,Pubtemp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:01:04 2015 UTC,Is this a joke. He said level 22 and 2 star. He doesn't have a build on him. His gears are probably at 5 and skills at 20 max. No ISO set.
FutureFight,3d9ezi,Drugs_and_Hugs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:47:38 2015 UTC,"damn that's OP, i guess i'll get right to him after 5* giant man."
FutureFight,3d9ezi,Pubtemp,0,Wed Jul 15 16:50:08 2015 UTC,Just did this yesterday. I was literally expecting him to just be fodder. He showed me...
FutureFight,3d9ezi,KenzouKurosaki,2,Tue Jul 14 16:31:55 2015 UTC,What about Giant-Man?
FutureFight,3d9ezi,Thesparkone,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:01:02 2015 UTC,"He's good against Speed(expect spiderman, a mistake I'll never make again)"
FutureFight,3d9ezi,bobsponge933,2,Wed Jul 15 00:24:59 2015 UTC,"And that's why I love him. He's the first blaster I actually really enjoyed playing and leveled up to Lv40. I've got Vision but even his immense power couldn't get me to really like his play style, so he's still sitting at Lv36.  Been testing YJ in siege for a few days against different opponents and he basically steamrolls everyone xD (except Destroyer, he takes a little longer but it's doable cause 2 of his attacks deal physical damage).  And in arena I'm just having a blast (terrible pun intended)."
FutureFight,3d9ezi,andaleo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:14:27 2015 UTC,"We're the same, YJ is the first blast type I really enjoy in the game, second is Star-Lord. I have a mono Blast team comprised of WM, YJ and SL as the leader (gives 30% boost to energy atk). 😄"
FutureFight,3d9ezi,MaxwellCardes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:19:37 2015 UTC,Nice one! I should really level my SL and WM and try that setup. Sounds like a real powerhouse team :)
FutureFight,3d9ezi,andaleo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:34:09 2015 UTC,YJ kills YJ in special mission pretty quick with the team setup but you might wanna replace WM as most of his skills are physical 😁
FutureFight,3d9ezi,MaxwellCardes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:19:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah true, when I woke up this morning I realized, but wait WM is mostly physical... Oh well, I'll throw in Rocket instead, he needs to level up as well."
FutureFight,3d9ezi,andaleo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:04:41 2015 UTC,That sounds like a really fun team.
FutureFight,3d9ezi,Drugs_and_Hugs,3,Wed Jul 15 03:49:23 2015 UTC,there is no other character in this game that can do that..   You've seriously never seen Vision?
FutureFight,3d9ezi,IKabobI,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:09:01 2015 UTC,A 4* Vision can obliterate a 4* Yellow Jacket.... His third skill deals enough damage.... PLUS.. He's a uni hero.
FutureFight,3d9ezi,bobsponge933,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:26:13 2015 UTC,You would be quite wrong. Even UVision of higher rank doesn't take out YJ. I expected it to be close... it isn't. Not even a little. YJ is surprisingly VERY good at handling Vision.
FutureFight,3d9ezi,chaoticheartld,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:53:32 2015 UTC,I tried to experiment MUTIPLE times and failed to beat him once . Vision has moves that can dodge attacks and breaks while YJ has one dodge attack....
FutureFight,3d9ezi,bobsponge933,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:50:27 2015 UTC,A rank 4 vision cant do that.... I have a rank 5 vision and he is powerful but not even in the same league as yj
FutureFight,3d9ezi,dann511,2,Tue Jul 14 16:45:49 2015 UTC,"I second this. I know vision's good, but besides his density shift his other skills are not that OMFGTHATDMG. His dash has pretty mediocre damage, and his beam besides the fact that follows you into oblivion has just standard beam damage, more or less. I'm still 30~ bios untill I 5* him so idk what his last skill does in term of damage.  Yellowjacket on the other hand: his first skill, from what I've seen, does just about as much if not more damage than density shift, his second does ok damage and makes him invulnerable, which alone is a very good thing, and his third is really cool. Has some brief invulnerable states and does pretty high damage, but its easily brakeable."
FutureFight,3d9ezi,Spedwards,2,Tue Jul 14 16:57:27 2015 UTC,"You obviously haven't seen my Vision... :P  My Vision has taken down a rank 6 Spider-Man as well as a rank 6 Captain America, both on auto."
FutureFight,3d9ezi,MegaMohsi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:09:07 2015 UTC,"yeah I have him at level 28 3* and he just crushes in VS, I need to farm him to 4* or get a flash sale."
FutureFight,3d9ezi,darxide23,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:39:34 2015 UTC,"Two of his first 3 abilities make him immune and untargetable and the other ability has a high chance to break. Yes, he's a freaking beast. I'll be really surprised if he isn't nerfed in the next update."
FutureFight,3d9ezi,bobsponge933,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:25:31 2015 UTC,Try him against a 4* + Vision... he still gets rekt. Vision is a GOD in everything....
FutureFight,3d9ezi,chaoticheartld,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:24:34 2015 UTC,I have tried him against a 5/5 lvl 45 UVision back when my YJ was just 3/3. UVision hit him... once. Only once. YJ killed him and went on to own the rest of the team.  The first character in an Arena match to face YJ is pretty much insta-lose due to his leadership. The same for the third character when his Leadership comes off of cooldown. Only the 2nd character actually gets a chance to hurt him.
FutureFight,3d9ezi,Thesparkone,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:55:25 2015 UTC,My 4 star no mastery level 39 YJ beat 5 star all mastery level 43 Cap Marvel.
FutureFight,3d9ezi,Confuurious,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:21:11 2015 UTC,"YJ is probably the best char now. I have him at 3 star and two mastery lvls and he can already handle stages 10 levels above him?!! He destroyed lvl 38 teams in arena single-handedly as well, he is easily the strongest in dueling now, his crowd clearing is pretty good but pales in comparison with his ability to wreck heroes..."
FutureFight,3d9ezi,arykmax,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:23:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have him at 4* lvl 40 and he's a monster.  Should only get better as I start turning those stars red!"

FutureFight,3d82n6,Lanceuppercut47,5,Tue Jul 14 06:17:16 2015 UTC,Force closing and crashes.
FutureFight,3d82n6,Spedwards,3,Tue Jul 14 07:09:18 2015 UTC,"It happened to me when i had connection issues and the inet connection was reset during the match.  You lose the entry, gain no points, no honor (not 100% sure here, maybe you get the 25, but i don't think so), and your victory count is reset as well."
FutureFight,3d82n6,aphysmael,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:40:22 2015 UTC,It also doesn't advance the pvp quests either.  Good list!
FutureFight,3d82n6,HoodooX,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:28:57 2015 UTC,"Game crashes sometimes when you start a match, becomes a draw."

FutureFight,3d82n6,knightzeemo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:16:17 2015 UTC,Do they get the points for draw-ing?  If they do they better force close instead of losing against 5★ champs at the first day of arena .
FutureFight,3d82n6,Ileb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:12:50 2015 UTC,"never tried it, but if time finishes before all the team is dead does it count as draw? (kiting for 5 minutes)."
FutureFight,3d8i8g,bbylvkeni,3,Tue Jul 14 09:39:41 2015 UTC,"I rolled Def Pen for both Ronan and Ultron.  It's their inherent strength, and I like to max out each character's strengths.  I think Def Pen is usually the stat that gives you the most bang for your bucks, as stats like attack speed, skill cool down require a ridiculous number of boosts to see a noticeable difference."
FutureFight,3d8i8g,imjms737,3,Tue Jul 14 10:07:37 2015 UTC,"If you are thinking about getting him to 5* eventually, I would invest in skill cool down. I have at 5* Ronan with skill cool down and all I do spam his skills and at most I would have to wait 1-2 seconds before each skill is up. Ronan isn't known for his auto attack so cool down is really useful."
FutureFight,3d8i8g,BobbySmithGang,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:34:39 2015 UTC,Also with Ultron
FutureFight,3d8i8g,CountHalphas,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:41:24 2015 UTC,Defense penetration is the route to go with Ronan.
FutureFight,3d8i8g,tegeusCromis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:20:57 2015 UTC,"Depends on what special gear you intend to use, if crit rate, then crit damage would make sense.  Honestly, though, the 4th gear blue stats all have a pretty unnoticeable effect. I'm happy with almost anything on all but my most key heroes."
FutureFight,3d8i8g,misho86,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:11:30 2015 UTC,i put Def Pen on mine
FutureFight,3d8i8g,Shrian124,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:07:08 2015 UTC,Ohh. Thats great then. I put Def Pene on them both. But he is rather slow to attack thats why I asked. Thanks for the replies
FutureFight,3d8i8g,tegeusCromis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:33:42 2015 UTC,"If he's a slow attacker you DEF want def pen then.  You can't afford to miss since he attacks more slowly, otherwise it's a huge dps loss."

FutureFight,3d8clr,Kinrubich,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:47:49 2015 UTC,I would have said Bullseye and Ronan due to his mastery. His skills also lock him down which makes him a massive laser target.

FutureFight,3d8clr,Gpaint,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:29:34 2015 UTC,If we don't factor in the rarity of the three you listed I would level Malekith because he is a great help in VS. I can't comment on Red Hulk for now and while Angela is a beast for damage she's squishy without a breaking skill.

FutureFight,3d8si9,palmermarc,2,Tue Jul 14 14:27:35 2015 UTC,It can be taken as a good thing. That means we will get a whole new set of uniforms for other characters sometime soon. Hopefully end of July...

FutureFight,3d8si9,nomercyvideo,-1,Tue Jul 14 17:29:11 2015 UTC,So use cap for more shield
FutureFight,3d8si9,IKADIXA,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:04:22 2015 UTC,The shield throw is just helps his way clear and takes away a not as good skill his other skills makes him better then cap at clearing IMO.

FutureFight,3d7hul,IrmaGoodness,2,Tue Jul 14 03:55:29 2015 UTC,Still worth doing on iOS if you're in an arena fight or VS.
FutureFight,3d7hul,tegeusCromis,2,Tue Jul 14 06:36:12 2015 UTC,It's such a weird problem on iOS because it only happens after a fight. Really odd. At least the option's there if it ever happens before.

I'm still getting complete freezes after levels, on the loading screen that comes after the exp and loot gain screen. No way to get out of it unless you force the app to quit.  This happens in every mode except Bonus for some reason. You'll notice that it's especially annoying when it happens in No Limit Special Missions. I've read several other accounts of that happening here and I have a horrible feeling it's narrowing down to iPhone 5 users.   For anyone who's contacted support before, are you also unable to reply to the help desk email address?

FutureFight,3d7wda,hayatecrawford,2,Tue Jul 14 05:10:16 2015 UTC,"Firstly, if you like the character, go for it and use him as your main.  But you should keep in mind that in terms of long-term, all-around usability (not only story mode, but also arena and villain siege), there are other characters that are better. (WM, Vision, Ultron, Ronan, etc) But with that said, a uniformed, fully-ranked and mastered Capt America is a bloodtanking beast.   If you see yourself using Capt. A in the long run, some of my favorites were:   Memories of Civil War: Teams with all types represented are always great. All strikers for each other.  Captains Crew: Also a stackable bonus with Fellowship. They also all strike for each other.  Capt. A & Thor & Capt. Marvel: Thor & Marvel don't strike for each other, but Capt. A strikers for both. Two universals and two team bonuses are not a bad mix.    I used to run Capt. A as my main for a while, until I got the JI team. Now I run Spidey and Venom with Iron Patriot leading, and haven't looked back."

FutureFight,3d7wda,Zyraz-,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:03:49 2015 UTC,Hit level 40 then get Bloodthirst. Especially if you are running him as Leader.  Take Captain to end game. He can facetank everything in this game with ease... and once he gets a 6* skill then he will back that up with good damage.
FutureFight,3d7wda,theorycl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:45:19 2015 UTC,"While the popular choice is to get a defensive bonus with shield proc, I've been trying out something else.   Since Uniform invulnerability procs quite often, I figured I should take the most advantage of it with an HP recovery bonus set. I have a 66% recovery rate booster equipped. So when it procs, you can watch Cap take all the hits for no damage while regenerating back to full health. -- (but obviously effectiveness varies with difficulty)  So far I'm really enjoying it. Really does feel like a ""Super Soldier"" with the invulnerability and healing factor. He can easily autorun stages of similar enemy levels with almost full health intact by the end. Cap isn't my main so I can't really elaborate much more on it at the moment."
FutureFight,3d6epv,EdgarDom81539,9,Mon Jul 13 21:54:35 2015 UTC,"TBH, I typically just go with the 1st 6 ISO set that pops for me, otherwise looking for a specific set could cost 300-400k easily."
FutureFight,3d6epv,Blitqz21l,5,Mon Jul 13 22:44:09 2015 UTC,"Man, I wish I was able to abide by your standard. I keep on rerolling for an ISO set until I see at least two stats that I want, and boy it has cost me."

FutureFight,3d6epv,Blitqz21l,2,Tue Jul 14 01:56:23 2015 UTC,"Same with me, but since I want to put YJ, BP and Spidey in my main team I wouldn't mind to invest a little more in them. So hearing what other people think would be great. For now I'm running this and it's working rather well, but if there's something better for them I'm all ears :p  Spider-Man: Power of Symbiote. It actually works quite well since spidey has a pretty high attack speed, but something with dodge would be preferable like Silent Night.  Yellowjacket: Animal Instinct. Can't really complain here, YJ already has a pretty high dodge for a blast type and this only increases it (it's 10.99% now and pretty effective). The shield procs quite often and allows for safer kiting when his skills are on cd.  Black Panther: also Power of Symbiote. I think this one or Ultron's Hatred are perfect for him. He has a high attack speed and his 2nd skill is a multi-hit."
FutureFight,3d6epv,andaleo,2,Mon Jul 13 22:54:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed. While I think most want to have Bloodthirst, it's really all a matter of dealing with RNGesus..."
FutureFight,3d6epv,KenzouKurosaki,2,Tue Jul 14 00:09:22 2015 UTC,"Venom: Bloodthirst -> Since all his skills, barring his 4th, are multi-hit, the shield procs very frequently, and the stats boosts are perfect for his already high crit rate and recovery rate.   Malekith: Ultron's Hatred -> He's a character who only needs damage output, and a properly landed Aether Bolt is almost a guaranteed attack boost.   Spider-man: Animal Instinct -> The HP and defense boost and the shield complement his weak defense (he actually now has the highest phy def in my roster), and the crit damage and dodge boost are great for him.   Destroyer: Angel of Death -> For a skill-heavy attacker like Destroyer having a 15% skill cool down proc is heaven-sent. Attack speed and defense penetration are his weakness and strengths, so the boosts are also very good for him."
FutureFight,3d6epv,imjms737,3,Mon Jul 13 23:53:41 2015 UTC,"I tend not to attack with the Destroyer, he kites until the skills are up again so attack speed is a little wasted."

FutureFight,3d6epv,tom641,3,Tue Jul 14 00:53:59 2015 UTC,"Not really for min-maxing and more for additional info for ISO sets as compared to just Bloodthirsting every character. If re-rolling for a specific ISO set will cost me 1 million gold then so be it, I'd do that over settling for some random ISO set that wouldn't even help the character in any way just to save some gold. I mean, this is ISO sets we are talking about. It's THE gold sink of the game, so either spend on it or don't do it at all."
FutureFight,3d6epv,Zephyraine,3,Tue Jul 14 01:39:26 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the fact that certain sets can significantly change the way a character plays. Ronan goes from good to godly with a cooldown set, and any number of squishy losers become nightmares with shield sets."
FutureFight,3d6epv,IrmaGoodness,2,Tue Jul 14 02:29:01 2015 UTC,"I agree - it's hella expensive to get the ideal ISO set, but I think it's really end-game material. I just like to think of it as a long-term investment. Expensive? Very. Worth it? I think so."

FutureFight,3d6epv,tom641,4,Tue Jul 14 02:25:41 2015 UTC,"No there's nothing wrong with it at all, i'm mostly just saying it's alright if you only get a set that's ""pretty good"" and not ""The best""."
FutureFight,3d6epv,Zephyraine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:25:39 2015 UTC,"It depends on how dedicated you are in the end. If you're just casually collecting heroes then yes, you can just get a 'decent' set and roll along. But since any adjustments to ISOs that are equipped on a character require crystals, serious players should definitely roll till they get the best ISO set they can use at that time to avoid spending unnecesary crystals to adjust their ISO set to their liking at a later date. For instance, you don't want to roll and equip a 4 ISO set and then decided that you should go Bloodthirst later and found out that you need to unequip at least 3 of the ISOs from the existing set as that will cost you weeks worth of daily quest earned crystals."
FutureFight,3d6epv,thirstykenny,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:22:11 2015 UTC,what another good set for war machine? i was thinking of using the 15% cdr but now i think it isn't worth it.
FutureFight,3d6epv,Zephyraine,2,Tue Jul 14 02:03:12 2015 UTC,Personally I think Bloodthirst is better for War Machine. Animal Instinct is good too but a higher defense and dodge in exchange for attack power on WM is abit wasted in my opinion. War Machine's character is built to be a Tank + Power if you hadn't noticed. His basic attacks as well as skills hit for ALOT of damage even though his stats are not as high as other characters. It is for this reason that WM should invest in Bloodthirst for the HP + Shield proc for additional tankiness as well as having the extra % for Attack will make his already strong attacks to be even better. Animal instinct seemed better suited for a tank character that doesn't deal as much damage such as Capt America.
FutureFight,3d6epv,imjms737,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:18:36 2015 UTC,"I rolled Animal Instinct and decided to stick with it.  I think he's better off on attacking sets like Bloodthirst that proc on attack, but Animal Instinct makes him a tank with his already high defense and HP, so I'm pretty happy with AI."

FutureFight,3d6epv,tegeusCromis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:33:36 2015 UTC,"I think the +defence sets are useless. We can't be sure how much actual damage reduction the proc translates to, but it doesn't look like it could possibly prevent as much damage as the shield prevents or the heal restores."
FutureFight,3d7owy,Royal-Highness,2,Tue Jul 14 04:00:42 2015 UTC,"Figure out how many you can fit into 29.9 minutes for each one. If it is close within one or two, then do Stage 4.

Difference in time completion between 3 & 4 2. Difference in % of bio drop rates (and the shifter bios)"
FutureFight,3d7owy,agent_patrick_star,2,Tue Jul 14 04:15:33 2015 UTC,"For me, it can differ by up to 30 seconds. This sounds like a good tradeoff, but I think you have to consider loading times (before, after and within the mission). Doing more stages means going through more loading times. Different phones and internet speeds will have different effects. For me, I can do around 2-3 more rounds on lv 3 than lv 4. I have no idea the exact number, but from what I experienced, the difference is NOT worth it. I used to get around 5 on average per unlimited rounds on lv 3. On lv 4 I usually get 8 bios. Then again, it all depends on whether RNGesus approves of you or not :P"
FutureFight,3d7owy,kaige,2,Tue Jul 14 04:24:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for ur input. Well.. 2-3 more chances of getting bios.. Looks good. Coupled with an ally assist, it should make the round faster. Alright perhaps I'll try with Stage 3 for now! By ""difference is worth it"", you mean it is better in Stage 3 for bios drop? 8 in 30 mins? That's sweet."

Honestly, it sometimes just depends on the device I'm using and the loading time between stages.  For example, for Giant Man, I've gotten to 16 stages once using rank 4, on bluestacks on my pc.  That's using the assist for the boss, using a 5* rank 5 UVision.  Basically means, 96 energy, basically a full bar, at Shield lvl 46.  Doing the same with YJ, I get 15 runs, there's a definitely a little leeway with 15, as it gives you a couple of mins of error."
FutureFight,3d7owy,mstheterror,2,Tue Jul 14 04:45:17 2015 UTC,Stage 4 for me except for when the timer is about to run out then 5.  My target time is 1:30 which I can usually use a single hero to plow through with to level up the other two.

If you do the math that means I'm losing roughly 1:00 every run to loading screens, so I'd go to stage 5 if I could get 10 safe runs in.  The exp matters more than the bios if I ever get a hero that strong, as I can go farm elites for a similar reward."

FutureFight,3d4xik,BrainWav,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:43:33 2015 UTC,"Non-mainstream? For decades, Iron-Man has been pretty iconic, and as mainstream as they come. Of course Marvel had to start out with a popular hero for their first phase 1 movie. Arguably Captain America and Ironman are like the Marvel counterparts for Superman and Batman respectively.    But great guide nonetheless! I like to add that I've gotten some breaks with his missile skill, so you can add that part in :)  After some proper upgrades and a high enough skill cooldown, you can send him in VS alone. I used to bring a couple extra allies with him just to swap him out once I burn through his skills. But now, he's more than capable of spamming without much waiting/kiting needed.   Very underrated early on, absolute kiting monster at 5-Star. I've been pairing him with Starlord for the 37.5% energy attack boost. The sheer damage output from the two alone is very addicting."

FutureFight,3d74ei,andaleo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:23:25 2015 UTC,I was struggling with the decision myself. I just purchased it. Due to the amount of characters they could release uniforms for I would assume it will not be a priority to bring it back for awhile.  War Machine is well known to be an excellent hero and highly effective in VS so adding a uniform on him is a smart move if you can get it.

I sincerely doubt Rulk can say the same; even doubling his damage through leadership and special probably isn't enough to topple Hank or T'Challa with a decent leadership in play.

Unlinked G+, closed game and reopened, relinked G+, closed and reopened, still no friends. Repeated all that, still nothing. With G+ relinked, I synced the 2nd Facebook account.

FutureFight,3d7oj6,DrEntly,3,Tue Jul 14 17:05:34 2015 UTC,"if you plan on running team Pym and want to squeeze every last bit of dps you can out of your team, then yes. Giant Man will end up being your plower more likely than not, and Ant Man is the only one who strikes for him on that team. That being said, Giant Man is amazing on his own. Buy the Goliath costume by itself, farm his special for a week and you'll have him 5+ stars and destroying everything. I don't think too many people have Ant Man at 5 stars yet to review him, but Giant Man at 5 stars is amazing. Yellow Jacket is just icing on the cake for team Pym.  Edit: Look at the passives for Ant Man vs Giant Man. Giant Man procs when he attacks, gives him 30% move speed, 10% attack and 10% defense. With his suit that turns into 20% attack and 20% defense, pretty much 2/3 of the time. Ant Man procs when he gets hit, which a speed character should be avoiding, and only gives him 5% move speed 5% attack speed and 10% attack, which gets an extra 5% dodge and 10% attack when wearing the suit. 5% dodge on it's own isn't worth much, but if you build up his dodge then you cut down on the passive's proc rate. Giant Man all the way."

His ridiculous HP, 5sec immunity and HP related bonus from ISO lets him soak up a lot of Vision's damage, while getting in a few good solid hits when Vision isn't flying around in the air.

Personally, going for Wasp, it's much easier to get her bios with the special mission shifter for YellowJacket.

FutureFight,3d4ip7,IKabobI,5,Mon Jul 13 13:36:35 2015 UTC,"Short answer: No. Blast vs Combat is about 15-20% boost to attack.  Long answer: Blast during Combat boss VS or combat story/pve missions. Universal for mob clearing, Destroyer/Ronan, PvP."
FutureFight,3d4ip7,Trunksshe,3,Mon Jul 13 13:39:13 2015 UTC,"The focus in VS is dealing the most damage that you can against the boss before the timer runs out so blasters against combat bosses are better than universals. In all other modes in the game you can use leaderships so universal is better with ronan. Apart from VS, universal is better except when you're using star lord's leadership."

FutureFight,3d4ip7,chmsax,2,Mon Jul 13 20:56:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's why you need a majority of the characters, so if you waste one, it's not a big deal. This is for when you're already clearing stage 7 or 8, and it'll add an extra stage just from using teams of 3 instead of 1.

I've also had good success with Daredevil - open with his stun, hit with another skill, and run away. I do this with both Ronan and Destroyer to good effect. The stun shuts down the Destroyer's attacks, really disrupting the flow and making it easier to survive."
FutureFight,3d59g9,pksullivan,4,Mon Jul 13 18:10:44 2015 UTC,"WM demolishes the Destroyer, but it's overkill/a big waste. His kit is needed for Bullseye and Ock."

FutureFight,3d59g9,pksullivan,2,Mon Jul 13 18:33:44 2015 UTC,"I agree re: Ock, but that applies even more to the Destroyer. Any hero with a pulse and physical damage can take it on.  Malekith is a better Bullseye killer, I think, all else being equal. Of course, not many people can keep their Malekith on par with their WM."
FutureFight,3d59g9,tegeusCromis,2,Mon Jul 13 18:44:09 2015 UTC,"I only just unlocked Malekith today with a Lab mission. His rarity will make him difficult to have in any sort of effective capacity, I think."

FutureFight,3d59g9,rhysappa12,5,Mon Jul 13 17:16:23 2015 UTC,"Any hero that doesn't rely on energy damage will do. But some standouts for me are Gamora, Angela, Nebula, and Elektra. Quick characters with strong multihit attacks. Ranged heroes (not energy-based!) like Yondu, Hawkeye and even Bullseye are also good if you don't need them for other VS bosses. Aside from their skills, you can pull off a few free attacks every time the Destroyer charges and misses."
FutureFight,3d59g9,tegeusCromis,4,Mon Jul 13 17:17:58 2015 UTC,"Wonder why no one mentioned Spidey. He has very fast and safe combos against Destroyer. I'd say Spidey, BP, Sharon and Gamora are the best for this job."
FutureFight,3d59g9,agent_patrick_star,2,Mon Jul 13 18:12:39 2015 UTC,"Unless he is a stage 8 or 9 I only use fodder for destroyer because he is one of the easiest.   Always send in fodder in pairs to tag out of the meteors. Some fodder that works well for me: Bullseye, winter soldier, CA, hulk, falcon, doc, mocking bird, etc...Obviously my fodder is not your fodder but you get the idea. Bullseye and WS in particular I love for him due to their breaks. For high level stages I use whoever I WON'T or CAN'T use on the stage 9."
FutureFight,3d59g9,Gpaint,2,Mon Jul 13 19:59:00 2015 UTC,Sharon Carter is amazing against Destroyer. She can kill him without being damaged even at higher levels.

I really enjoy using Angela, but I only have her at 3 stars so she's better for soloing lower level bosses. I've also had excellent personal experiences with Hulkbuster, although this sub doesn't seem to feel similarly; some of his skills deal energy damage and so don't get through to Destroyer, but I've found him to be a very safe and effective option for anything up to level 7."
FutureFight,3d59g9,Extranationalidad,2,Mon Jul 13 17:55:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe I just suck, but I find it really annoying, as HB, having to clomp away from the Destroyer as it charges the explosion. It's possible to get away, but not if you dawdle for even a moment. Also a bit of a waste of the passive, I feel. I would much rather use HB against Ronan."
FutureFight,3d59g9,tegeusCromis,2,Mon Jul 13 18:13:15 2015 UTC,"You ain't wrong. It's definitely an under-utilization of the passive. I generally don't 'save' any characters for Ronan though, as he's manageable with anything I tend to have left; and because HB is kinda slow and unwieldy, and the Destroyer is kinda slow and unwieldy, it's easier for me to keep HB alive against him than against either Doc or Bullseye."
FutureFight,3d59g9,Extranationalidad,2,Mon Jul 13 19:19:32 2015 UTC,"Fair points. Personally, I think both Ronan and the Destroyer are free kills, so I am fine throwing HB against either. It just feels more satisfying/efficient when it's Ronan."
FutureFight,3d59g9,tegeusCromis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:53:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I just in the last few days moved from ""sometimes beat level 9 if it's a lucky line-up or I play lights out against Doc"" to ""pretty much always beat 9 unless I mess up,"" so I'm looking forward to re-tailoring my VS options and cutting down on the victory-by-attrition kills. HB will definitely be outclassed over time but I have found him slightly handier than the common line around here might lead one to believe."
FutureFight,3d59g9,Extranationalidad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:06:29 2015 UTC,"I'm hit or miss with Hulkbuster. I keep forgetting his first attack doesn't break. His clap is great for disrupting Destroyer, though."
FutureFight,3d59g9,pksullivan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:11:35 2015 UTC,"Vemon is the best one.   For me, worst to best is (out of the characters I would use that I have unlocked): Hawkeye>Black Cat>Thor>Gamora>Black Panther>Angela>Winter Soldier>Vemon  I'll use other chars too..but those are characters that I don't need for any other particular character. For instance, Vision is still a really good choice, but for how easy he can take out a high level Doc Oc or Bullseye, I would be stupid to do this when I have so many other characters in my pool that are just as good for him."
FutureFight,3d59g9,hohndo,2,Mon Jul 13 18:10:32 2015 UTC,"I strongly suspect you are not getting the most out of your Gamora. Between her three skills (I'm assuming you don't have 5* yet) and bleed, she deals absurd damage very, very safely. And she's extremely quick on her feet, making it trivial to dodge the fire rocks and everything the Destroyer can throw at you. I consider her the absolute best anti-Destroyer hero.  That said, she's also too good to not use on Bullseye, IMO."
FutureFight,3d59g9,tegeusCromis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:51:29 2015 UTC,"Gamora is surprisingly good. I just didn't have her at 4 star till just yesterday so it's been mostly a process of leveling her up.  She has not been a viable level to do much till recently. Still only at 32 though. I was leveling her with Blade and Angela since that was a +10% attack speed, which made Angela and Gamora quite impressive.  Winter Soldier used to be my best guy for Destroyer before I got Vemon to 3 star.  Edit: I had used her on Bullseye before but she was far too low of a level to do anything but did really well. Which prompted me to start leveling her."
FutureFight,3d59g9,hohndo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:47:11 2015 UTC,I had good luck with Gamora too (mine is level 29/3*). It helps that her attacks cause her to evade laterally.
FutureFight,3d59g9,ohoni,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:10:09 2015 UTC,"That's some really odd math there. I think Thor only has 1 skill that hurts Destroyer, but you have him ahead of both Black Cat and Hawkeye (I assume he's under 3 stars)? Vemon, is that like a German/Rastafarian alt of Venom? I'd put all of Gamora, BP, and Angela ahead of Winter Soldier."
FutureFight,3d59g9,Thesparkone,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:09:44 2015 UTC,"To be fair the only ones fully fleshed out in that list are Winter Soldier, Thor, Vemon, and Angela.  Winter Soldier and Angela are great characters, particularly Destroyer if you know how use them. My 3* level 40 WS can actually kill Destroyer faster than Vemon. But Vemon I can just throw in Auto (fire and forget?) because of how much more tanky he is compared to WS and Vemon's skills don't need to be in any particular order. (I was using auto as a example from his Rift encounter)  I can't stand using Hawkeye but I do know he's pretty good. He's really only level 22 or so.  Didn't really rate them off of who is best, but more who I use. Gamora is on the verge of being used regularly but I'm stopping briefly to 3 or 4 star RH.  Edit: I'm not really sure why Thor works well. I haven't figured out why but his energy attacks do damage sometimes. I've never taken time to get numbers on him vs Destroyer, though. I just use Thor, and he goes down easy. Thor had probably fought bigger."

FutureFight,3d3wh2,keffeine,3,Mon Jul 13 09:03:40 2015 UTC,"I've created a database in which i noted all shifter appearances i have encountered since they were introduced, together with the stage and the team in/for which they appeared. I don't know if there is a stage bound limit of appearances, but i frequently experienced phases of several consecutive appearances and then silence for a while. Though i usually don't run stages more than 4 or 5 times in a row (with the exception of Special Missions).  While my own data is not enough to be more than coincidental, my impression is that the shifter appearance is more bound to your team characters than to the stage. Also i found that Shifters seem to be fixed to being ally or enemy (for ex. War Machine is always an ally, Iron Man always enemy).  For example i needed one more Malekith, but he just didn't show up, then several days later i switched to a team that had a Malekith appearance previously and voila, second run there he was.  So as you describe a similar experience i would be interested, if you also switched teams, or are you still using the same?  To answer your question: I had War Machine appearances in 1.3, 1.6, 1.8, 2.4, 2.8, 3.4, 3.8, 3.9 and 4.2 Most frequently with Cap America, Sharon Carter, Mockingbird, but i specifically remember Iron Mania as well, because the boss battle resulted in War Machine + War Machine vs. War Machine + Iron Man"

It's worth noting that since then, a game like Marvel Avengers Alliance hasnt only released 1 Xmen and it was one that wasn't in movies (Cannonball) and 0 F4 content.  Since Fox is expanding his franchise with Apocalypse and the New mutants it's unlikely any popular mutant or Deadpool will show up."

FutureFight,3d3uh2,ArekkusuRin,2,Mon Jul 13 09:27:53 2015 UTC,"I unlocked everything but am only boosting the warp machine. Free bios are great. I like to get the cheap easy materials from the shop to save my energy and focus on farming the harder missions.  The 2 for 1 converter is a waste. I have worked too hard farming bios to trade them away for chances of getting ones I might want. Even if I get the ones I want, the one or two that I get aren't going to make or break my characters."

FutureFight,3d3uh2,MikeSeven,2,Mon Jul 13 18:36:46 2015 UTC,I'm also going with the warpmachine. Antimater wenn you have the generator doesn't cost you anithing more.  So basicaly you get exp. (not much) and bio's for antimater
FutureFight,3d3uh2,ZoeJoK,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:54:44 2015 UTC,"Absolutely the warp machine.  It's an easy bio per mission (or more, for the randomly Perfect Clear) which doesnt use your energy or your best condition.  Sure, the bio is random too but the more missions you have to run the more chances you get.  I've got it at 5 missions so far (the first three take 30 minutes each to resolve, the next two take 45 minutes...I can only assume the time increases further as I upgrade) and that's 5 bios per day I wouldn't normally have.  I'm happy with that."
FutureFight,3d3uh2,dearbluey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:57:24 2015 UTC,"The priority list seems to be Warp Machine > Shop > Bio converter  People have explained the warp machine, the shop gets better in selection and pricing as you upgrade it, and the Bio Converter gets more uses per day.  People knock the Bio converter but since it only costs bios and antimatter to use I think it's nice to have since you can turn something like Ghost Rider bios into something else."
FutureFight,3d3uh2,tom641,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:21:48 2015 UTC,"Seems great if you don't want or need that bio, but even then maybe not.

Vision is great, but if you could pick who you get buos for out of even a smaller selection that would be way more preferable than random out of a larger selection."
FutureFight,3d3uh2,Relinquint,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:24:58 2015 UTC,"Yes but it's an excuse to farm bios for bad characters like Rider or Doc Ock, and you can see who you're gambling for.

FutureFight,3d282t,Drugs_and_Hugs,7,Sun Jul 12 22:52:49 2015 UTC,"At this current time, I am going to throw a curveball and say Black Widow. There hasn't been much talk on the forums about the new 6* skills... but they are insane. Widow's 6* skill does 3x more damage than Widow's Bite, with the same paralyzing effect and DoT AND it is a large AOE attack. So far I haven't come across any PvE mobs where it doesn't one shot everyone. It also wrecks in Arena.  So until more heroes get 6* skills, a 6* BW has to be right up there at the moment."
FutureFight,3d282t,Zyraz-,3,Mon Jul 13 04:33:09 2015 UTC,"I agree, although I reserve the right to revisit my opinion after comparing her to 6* Ultron & Vision (she makes their 5* versions seem wimpy).  Her 6* skill has such a wide radius that it breaks barrels during hands-off auto-play that standard  plow heroes (Ultron/Hulkbuster) miss. Doesn't make her a god perhaps, but it gives her playtime preference over those ""gods"" when farming.  Being speed is a slight disadvantage in VS, but by level 50 she can make a major dent in a level 9 combat boss."
FutureFight,3d282t,olon97,3,Mon Jul 13 05:37:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah the only reason I am mentioning her right now is because she is unique (along with spiderman) in having a 6* skill. Once some of the top tier heroes like Ultron and Vision also get 6* skills added, then she will sink down the list again I am sure."
FutureFight,3d282t,Zyraz-,11,Mon Jul 13 06:28:22 2015 UTC,"From my experience, based on ability to solo elite 8-7 and 8-10 and from many 6* arena fights I can currently only put two characters in ""God tier"". Vision and Ultron.    Vision. Has HP on gears; very fast attacks, 2 skills that can disrupt enemy animations and stop most opponent skills, and one skill that auto targets and does not miss (not counting dodge), all of them are disruptive. His passive makes him invulnerable to physical attackers, which is most of the cast, for a time allowing him to unload his crazy high damage. Versus energy attackers, he has a high energy defense and most energy attackers don't have a HP to go toe to toe. With the uniform he gets an added boost and suffers no type disadvantage.    Ultron. High base HP and HP on gears. His skills aren't as powerful as Vision's and his beam can whiff because it is not an auto target. But he is more of a tank and his skills are fast and disruptive. A universal character with no type disadvantage and with uniforms to give him a boost against every type except Universal.      That is it, except maybe Yellowjacket could break into it. Tier below that is Iron Patriot, Black Panther. Possibility Ant Man and Gamora join them. Removed Malekith"
FutureFight,3d282t,Ashy_Larry_1,6,Sun Jul 12 23:16:05 2015 UTC,"I just can't get to like ultron, maybe I am playing him wrong, but at 4* level 40 and all gear +9 he still seems weaker than gamora, war mashine, black panther all at level 35..."
FutureFight,3d282t,Malekith24,5,Mon Jul 13 00:04:21 2015 UTC,"I am the exact same. I have him at 4 stars and level 40 with +10 gears. Also have his mark 1 uniform. He just seems weaker than a lot of my other characters. He has high HP, but he doesn't withstand a lot of damage.   He is fine at running higher level elite missions, but he seems weak to me in higher level VS missions. I have characters on equal playing fields who perform much better.   I'm about to 5* him though. So he will be a pretty viable character after that."
FutureFight,3d282t,IrmaGoodness,4,Mon Jul 13 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"he seems weak to me in higher level VS missions.   That's the biggest distinction about Ultron. His skill set is excellent for clearing mobs and good enough for bursting down the PVE bosses with their middling health. He's frankly not that great for longer fights like in VS.   Edit: He is a mob-clearing god at 5*, the sheer fun and badassery of Electronic Field makes everything worthwhile."
FutureFight,3d282t,Sho1va,4,Mon Jul 13 01:28:00 2015 UTC,I agree to me he's hands down the best at annihilate missions.

FutureFight,3d282t,BobbySmithGang,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:18:55 2015 UTC,Farming Ultron in his new dungeon has really bad drop rates. I missed the chance of using my chaos tokens to get Ultron last patch and decided to save up for something better (have currently 20k chaos tokens). He is sitting at 3* and he seems a bit boring to play and I am not sure if I should keep trying to farm his bios. I really want to have his 5* skill. I'm not sure if he is even consider God Tier IMO.
FutureFight,3d282t,misho86,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:34:54 2015 UTC,"It really just depends what you're going for. Like I said, I don't think he is great for higher level vs missions, and you can make any character good in arena.   He is very solid at high elite levels though. Solid at clearing mobs because of his high hp. I auto play most missions and I usually just let him get to the boss. From there I use characters that are better at boss killing. For me that's Vision, Destroyer, Gamora, Iron Patriot.  In the end, I wouldn't say he isn't god tier. Just a step below that for sure though. Like tier 1.5. Right where I would put a Spider-Man."

FutureFight,3d282t,ConcealedTerror,3,Mon Jul 13 19:57:21 2015 UTC,"I think he is more on the tanking area. His strength lies on his  three uniforms and his passive that gives him poison and bleed resist plus his hp is also good. If you put web resist on him even he will not only theoretically tank GG, Black Panther, Gamora, he can also tank Spidey on the Arena."
FutureFight,3d282t,Sho1va,2,Mon Jul 13 00:09:57 2015 UTC,dodge is the best option
FutureFight,3d282t,andaleo,3,Mon Jul 13 02:19:32 2015 UTC,I agree with this but id say my IP is just as strong if not stronger than my Ultron. His only glaring weakness is being blaster.
FutureFight,3d282t,ConcealedTerror,3,Sun Jul 12 23:45:43 2015 UTC,"Your description of Vision is the exact reason why I think they shouldn't have given him a uniform. I know they did it because of the AoU movie so I'll let it pass. But they shouldn't have given it the boost that it has (at least let him remain a blast type), the other uniforms kinda pale in comparison. Even without his uniform Vision is a monstrous beast :p I'll have to agree though. Despite not being at those elite mission yet I can tell that Vision is indeed God tier. Can't really speak for Ultron as I haven't really leveled him yet. Same for WM and Gamora.  Ontopic: So yeah, for me it would have to be Vision, Yellowjacket and Black Panther.  Vision: ^ what Ashy_Larry_1 wrote describes it perfectly.  Yellowjacket's 1st skill makes him untargetable, while dealing a decent amount of damage. His 2nd skill does a kinda break? and does pretty high damage and it will re-target when your main target is dead. His 3rd skill is similar to his first one + a laser attack but does more damage, with the exception that he can be hit twice during the entire animation. I've been able to chain his skills fairly well, giving the target little room to counter attack. A little kiting is needed sometimes for the cooldowns.  Black Panther: Now I only have him at rank 3 so I may be missing out on an essential skill. But BP's skills do high damage right off the bat. His spear breaks and that's never wrong. His 2nd skill multiple strikes and sorta re-targets, it doesn't always work. And his 3rd skill is a two-strike attack, a high damage kick followed by three projectiles that can hit multiple targets. The only downside is, is that sometimes he doesn't finish the attack if your target dies right after the kick."
FutureFight,3d282t,andaleo,2,Sun Jul 12 23:53:01 2015 UTC,if vision didn't have uniform GG could easily 3shot him
FutureFight,3d282t,ConcealedTerror,2,Mon Jul 13 02:21:12 2015 UTC,"No I get that. My main point is, is that aside from becoming universal he gets stat boosts, resistance +15% and cc -15%. So basically he becomes more powerful while losing his only weakness against speed types. Sure, he also loses his edge vs combat but with his skill set he can still annihilate them np. They made an OP character more powerful which just seems kinda odd to me, don't you think? Not hating on Vision though, I just wonder why NM did that. They easily could've stuck with the stat boosts like any other character that has a uniform."
FutureFight,3d282t,andaleo,2,Mon Jul 13 02:53:21 2015 UTC,promotion possibly.
FutureFight,3d282t,nashvision,2,Mon Jul 13 02:57:50 2015 UTC,"I guess so. That must'v been more of a marketing decision than a developer one. But I still think he should've remained blast... Oh well, what's done is done."
FutureFight,3d282t,CountHalphas,2,Mon Jul 13 03:03:56 2015 UTC,The first 2 skills for Malekith seems underwhelming.  How is his 3* and 5* skills?
FutureFight,3d282t,PolishTamales,4,Sun Jul 12 23:46:52 2015 UTC,Do you use second and then follow up with first skill right after? It enables you to get better damage from Aether bolt which provides great damage output. His third is a jump/teleport and I use it in conjunction with the other two skills. Third skill ► second ► first is my combo for now.
FutureFight,3d282t,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:53:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why people are ""zerging"" in Arena, when most of the moves are designed as utility, not as sequenced attacks.   Unless the said character only has non-stun/flinch properties in their move sets, it's best to use the attacks as responses, followed by the correct punishment while kiting.   The attack sequence zerg only applies if the opposing character has all tracking moves or are lower rank."
FutureFight,3d282t,Kinrubich,3,Mon Jul 13 00:24:55 2015 UTC,"The simple reason is that while your method is superior in a close fight--I agree with that--it just isn't necessary to arena success. People will choose the easiest route to success, and that route, currently, is zerging + assists. Zoning, kiting, and other methods which are standard in some other games are simply excessive in this one. Actually, not only are they excessive, they're also slower. It makes sense to be a blood-tanking brute, and take way more damage, so long as you still win in the end, and win quicker (due to higher DPS).  Edit: Also, I missed this earlier, but we're talking about Malekith here. It absolutely makes sense to combo pull and bolt, because that lets you position for the best chance at getting the massive bolt damage. As for his leap attack, it can't really punish anything, so it is sensible to throw it in there at the first good opportunity."
FutureFight,3d282t,Ashy_Larry_1,3,Mon Jul 13 08:23:38 2015 UTC,lol. his aether bolt is his ace.
FutureFight,3d282t,Ashy_Larry_1,2,Mon Jul 13 00:33:14 2015 UTC,"Malekith's is a solo boss killer and arena combat fighter. His Aether Bolt (first skill) is a massive damage dealer. His 3* is a pull that leaves the opponent motionless for 3 seconds. This, combined with Aether Bolt is a brutal combo. His 5* is good, maybe not as good as others though."
FutureFight,3d282t,chaoticheartld,6,Mon Jul 13 00:38:16 2015 UTC,Because he really isn't a great all around character. He has one purpose. Dealing massive damage to bosses or in arena most specifically to combat characters. He has low overall survivability in clearing mobs and higher elite levels on his own because of lack of HP on his gears and skills that don't hit multiple enemies with a wide range
FutureFight,3d282t,SenpaiSpadesz,2,Mon Jul 13 01:19:18 2015 UTC,"I love Malekith, and I agree 100% with Ashy_Larry. Malekith is a single-target killer. He does this VERY well; in fact, he does this better than anyone else in the roster. However... that is basically all he does.   His mob clearing is sub-par, despite his skills being AoE (strange AoE, but AoE none-the-same). He has no tankiness to speak of, and cannot take very many hits before going down. Over-all, he is sub-par for using to go through Stages... or for using him for anything other than insta-melting bosses and Arena opponents.  With that said, if you are looking for someone to drop a meteor on a single target, then Malekith is your man. In addition, he also has one VERY important claim to fame. He is the ONLY character in the roster who is also able to become immune to every form of CC AND debuff (means burn, electrify, bleed, poison, all of it). He is the only one able to stop YJ's Paralysis.   With all that said, I would put him as ""Conditional Top Tier"". When used for certain things, he is a god. When used for anything else, he is way sub-par."
FutureFight,3d282t,msde,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:26:25 2015 UTC,My ultron is 5* and completely wreck's and tanks through bosses like it's nothing
FutureFight,3d282t,PolishTamales,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:07:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed, except Ronan is in the same tier to me because he has the best leadership skill in the game (unless spider-man dodge starts breaking everything), and it works on Vision and Ultron.  I feel like Ultron will fall out of the tier as soon as the next great Universal character arrives."
FutureFight,3d282t,ArekkusuRin,10,Mon Jul 13 12:52:42 2015 UTC,"Vision (w/uniform) is Tier 1 after the patch (removed tracking from his Shift). If it wasn't for his passive, he would be considered fair compared to the rest of the cast.  Black Panther & War Machine (w/uniform) is also in Tier 1 due to their instant stun options and the amount of damage they can output in a short time frame (War Machine's 5-Star attack especially).   Spider-Man is most likely Tier 1.5 just because how many Visions and Black Panters are out there in terms of Arena meta and most people can deal with Spidey in general.  Most of the popular characters like Captain Marvel, Ultron, Venom, etc are Tier 2 since they're not as good as the characters listed already. I've beaten an all 6-star Ronan team on accident with my 5-star Iron Mania and I can't say that the Leadership thing is as game breaking as some might say.  Characters to look out for are Yellow Jacket & Giant Man since Giant Man has tons of instant flinching moves and Yellow Jacket causes the opponent's specials to cancel out. Haven't fought against either of them high level in Arena, but they are really good even as low level bodies in Siege."
FutureFight,3d282t,ConcealedTerror,5,Wed Jul 15 01:33:54 2015 UTC,Vision is obvious.   I have a 5 star Malekith and he's the only one that gives my Vision of the same rank a run for his money. The burst damage is just unrivaled. First few seconds of any boss fight and a third to half their health is gone. In Arena and Villain Seige he rolls over the competition in a few hits. On top of all this he's immune to debuffs because of his leadership and causes  fear because of his passive.
FutureFight,3d282t,chaoticheartld,2,Mon Jul 13 00:12:52 2015 UTC,ultron prime with malekith leader leaves a wet spot in place of enemy malekith :P but other than that i would say his biggest problem is when his CC skill gets dodged
FutureFight,3d282t,ArekkusuRin,3,Mon Jul 13 00:30:29 2015 UTC,Few things make me break down into tears as quickly as Malekith missing his grasp...

FutureFight,3d282t,tegeusCromis,2,Mon Jul 13 03:44:58 2015 UTC,"Well if an opponent has 2% dodge only then 48% ignore dodge would mean he still dodges on a 1.04% chance sorta. If you take it to bigger proportions if opponent has 20% dodge then they'd still dodge 10.4% of the time with ignore dodge 48%. Seems right to me :p  Guess people expects a more specific ""completely ignore dodge bellow 48%"" rather than the ""48% chance to ignore dodge"" that it seems to be.  Unless some dev explains we'll just have to deal with the crappy translation we get."
FutureFight,3d282t,ConcealedTerror,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:57:16 2015 UTC,"That is a very reasonable interpretation. Oddly, it didn't occur to me before. This would make dodge a lot stronger (and ignore dodge a lot weaker) than most of us previously assumed."

Mission plowing, boss killing, arena ability, passive, leadership, skills, stats/gear, etc. Add up the scores and you have a complete tier list."
FutureFight,3d282t,Thesparkone,2,Mon Jul 13 04:02:02 2015 UTC,"It's not that vastly different in terms of who would still be at the top.   The only big account would be how many AOE moves a character has for Story/Elite/Special mode, but that's about it for Tier-2 characters.   Captain Marvel is ""okay"" for 1v1, but excels at crowd control in the traditional side-scroll beat-em up story/special/elite modes of the game.  If you have a character optimized for 1v1, there's a good chance they'll be just as good in other modes, unless their name is Ghost Rider."
FutureFight,3d282t,mrafrohyde,4,Mon Jul 13 01:21:18 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you value. I personally don't put much value into Arena since it's so easy to win there, and don't care that much for the 1 vs. 1 full auto fight argument. You'll get instances where Hero A > Hero B > Hero C > Hero A.   For me, I'd probably separate it into 2 categories to determine what tiers characters fall into. 1 for how well they can do auto runs on Special Missions, and 2 for how good they are in VS. Oh yeah, how well they do in high level elite stages should factor in, as well. Heh, I should also factor in how accessible that character is. A character could be a beast, but if he's too hard to rank up, then that hurts his value.   And, in conclusion, Blade is TOAA tier."
FutureFight,3d282t,PolishTamales,3,Mon Jul 13 01:31:08 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, no one mentioned Hulkbuster yet. I agree with Vision, by the way. But Hulkbuster is crazy too; this guy on 5* does insane combo, he rarely uses his auto attack.  He stuns, he tanks, he solos, he bursts, he has great leadership and passive, gear gives +All Attack, +HP, and everything a man could ask for.   Big guy with laser beam skill, it's Hulk on crack! BEST. HERO. IN. THE. GAME.  If only there's a team set of Hulkbuster, Vision, and Yellow Jacket..."
FutureFight,3d282t,tegeusCromis,3,Mon Jul 13 05:26:36 2015 UTC,"Hulkbuster is good, but does poorly as an AI controlled opponent in Arena. His attacks are great for crowd control, but many of his moves have high start up and recovery frames. This enables Black Panther or War Machine to instantly stun him before delivering all hits in his multi-hitting moves.   While he shares the same passive as Vision, none of his moves track like Vision (especially pre-patch Vision), outside of his high start up stun move. So while an AI Vision basically forces you to engage with him no matter what with his tracking beam attacks, you can simply run away from Hulkbuster during his invincibility passive trait and only take damage from his stun.  In addition to that, he only has one reliable stun/flinching move and that has a slow start up and can't be relied upon to interrupt long strings. His 5-Star attack also isn't as strong as War Machine/Iron man as well.   If Net Marble wants to make him better (IE Buff), then they need to give him a faster stun attack, flinching on the first hit of his 3-Star attack and/or increase the damage of his 5-star attack.  Don't get me wrong, Hulkbuster is one of my guilty pleasures in the game, but he's not as optimized as a damage dealer compared to Black Panther and to an extent, Venom. He does, however, rock as a tank character with high HP, high dodge and HP recovery via ISO-8."
FutureFight,3d282t,exaslave,2,Mon Jul 13 01:30:13 2015 UTC,There is nothing Hulkbuster does that Vision cannot do better.
FutureFight,3d282t,Wizmaxman,2,Mon Jul 13 01:40:15 2015 UTC,"Most of hulkbuster moves are multi hits, so if he gets stopped at first hit he loses a lot of his damage and are quite predictable. He is also very big so most hits will reach him, while small characters can just avoid a direct hit even by accident."
FutureFight,3d282t,Malthan01,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:38:12 2015 UTC,I love me some hulkbuster.   He's a great clearing machine in story/special and he can do a lot of damage for me in the late stage VS.
FutureFight,3d282t,MFFevu,3,Mon Jul 13 07:10:30 2015 UTC,"Black panther needs to be on this list, he is a kiting GOD and his debuff is crazy good"
FutureFight,3d282t,Blurkillerex,3,Mon Jul 13 15:38:45 2015 UTC,"IMO, Vision and War Machine are both god tier in this game (with and without uniforms)  Then, follows as pretty good characters: Spiderman, Black Panther and Malekith."
FutureFight,3d282t,toysoldierxiii,3,Mon Jul 13 03:29:17 2015 UTC,"God-tier? Giant Man for sure, he is my new fav character, at only 4* lvl 35 he kicks the ass of my 4* lvl 40 spidey, angela, nebula, ultron"
FutureFight,3d282t,webslinger42,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:41:59 2015 UTC,"Just wait until you get his 5 star. I never imagined a move could hit so hard - Ultron and some (not all) blasters are the only ones who aren't dead from one of them in the arena. My 42, 3/5 mastery, minimal iso is hitting that for ~5500. 5 times."
FutureFight,3d282t,Zephyraine,2,Mon Jul 13 11:06:24 2015 UTC,"So for the most part with the names people keep throwing around (War Machine, Vision, Ultron) the best characters are the ones that get alternate costumes which kind of sucks especially at the crystal cost.    If you have good allies in Arena no matter who you play as long as your are smart you will probably pull off a win."
FutureFight,3d282t,SenpaiSpadesz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:50:58 2015 UTC,My initial impression was that characters that appear in MCU should definitely get the costumes first since it also acts a promotion for the movie. WarMachine got the uniform really late considering he has been in MCU with Iron Man for about the same amount of time. And crystals for costumes aren't hard to get if you just do dailies + top 1% in arena weekly. That's 395 crystals per week which means you get 1 costume every 2 weeks assuming you don't just jump on every Bio flash sales that includes a character that you play with.
FutureFight,3d282t,ihavespeedforce,2,Mon Jul 13 12:50:38 2015 UTC,"Black Panther is easily one of the top character's in the game for many reason's. 1's his skills are on low cooldown and every single one of them either stun,break, or cause him to be untargetable. 2 is his bleed...i mean that dmg is just to real. 3. him as a character hit's crazy hard and has insane attack speed and some bulk to follow...Black panther is amazing"
FutureFight,3d282t,Zephyraine,2,Tue Jul 14 09:12:53 2015 UTC,"Well in my opinion I think Captain Marvel is OP, but that's because I solo'd the whole game using her and I'm too lazy to upgrade anyone else."

I don't think that's a fair statement yet at your current stage since everything that Capt Marvel does, someone else can do better. She's not bad by any means but nothing really stands out either.

FutureFight,3d4evh,Dragon88Power,2,Mon Jul 13 12:59:32 2015 UTC,I think you should work on unlocking and leveling War Machine. Him as leader with Vision and Venom in the team could take you quite far into the game.
FutureFight,3d4evh,tokomeki,2,Mon Jul 13 13:26:31 2015 UTC,IMO you should substitute your Iron Man with War Machine.

A level 45 Vision can easily solo that with two others to level. Aside from four newly unlocked, my whole roster is at least level 36 or almost 36.   IGN: YamiPrem"
FutureFight,3d4evh,yamiprem,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:54:55 2015 UTC,"So I'll also hammer in that you should level up war machine. He's a physical blaster unlike the energy blasters so he's still good against other blasters (who typically have high energy defense). He's also got great crowd control skills and decent cooldowns.  Vision and War Machine are both top tier in most of these threads as well, so they grow into some of the strongest champions. My highest three are Black Widow (easy to farm and strong), Venom and Spider-Man and I recently swapped BW with War Machine just because he's more fun even though he's 8 levels behind (31 vs my spider-man and venom being 39)  Edit: But that doesn't mean get rid of Iron Man. Iron Man is still a great character, he's just not quite as good as War Machine. He's still really easy to farm biometrics for and once he has three abilities he's a great nuker. Also I highly recommend picking up Giant Man or Yellow Jacket from the special missions. I opted for Yellow Jacket but Giant Man is pretty strong too. Most people think Yellow Jacket is going to be S tier and Giant Man is going to be A tier - either way they're both really strong, worth picking up."

FutureFight,3d2yz8,the2ndfifth,5,Mon Jul 13 02:47:13 2015 UTC,I do the Stark Crystals deal and that's it.  Basically 3 costumes a month for $5.
FutureFight,3d2yz8,troubleondemand,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:04:52 2015 UTC,"Same the only cash i've spent is for the Stark stash (3 months now) so a total of $12. Which for the amount of time i've spent playing this game I think that price is fair.  I have four 5* characters, seven 4* and and have all characters unlocked but like 8 mostly the new ones which I haven't gotten around to farming and hard to farms like black cat and Angela.  I have cleared 8-10 on normal and elite and I an can fully clear VS depending on the bosses.  So yes you can definitely get to 5* with out spending much or at all."
FutureFight,3d2yz8,UArcher,4,Mon Jul 13 15:43:54 2015 UTC,"I highly suggest farming giant man for a few days. As long as you can clear his level 4 mission without much trouble you can 4 star him in 3-4 days of doing his special twice daily. This will take about 200 energy each day to accomplish so it might not leave you much extra for other things, but he is awesome. He's like Drax and Gamora had a baby. 4 days of farming him and I am sitting at 51/160.  Then you can use him to easily and quickly farm others."
FutureFight,3d2yz8,coju3,3,Mon Jul 13 03:07:46 2015 UTC,"I have many 4*s and I haven't spent a dime. It's more about impulse control than anything else, really...know exactly what/who to spend on and you'll always have enough crystals."

Yellowjacket at 2* and level 25 is already really fun so I plan to get him up, as well as Ronan and Groot seemed interesting.

This is a tip that has been running around for a while here anyway.  Run the characters 9 times on missions, close the app and open it again and you can run 9 times again and keep it with the same characters.  Switching to other team and letting the main team rest is nonsense. Although I suppose if you're not focusing on specific characters and want to just keep running best condition you can run 9x with as many teams as you want :p"

That's way too severe. I mean there has to be a happy medium somewhere."
FutureFight,3d1z73,IrmaGoodness,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:29:18 2015 UTC,I completely agree with this. I use my vision with all my characters that I'm leveling up and I can't remember the last time he had best condition. Weeks? Seems a little ridiculous.

That team I overused was Ultron, Gamora and Doc Ock. I stopped using the last two for a couple of days and they've recovered BC, but Ultron is my main farmer so he still doesn't have it.   He's on break now while Vision and Ronan take over. I hope the condition comes back sooner rather than later."
FutureFight,3d1z73,IrmaGoodness,5,Mon Jul 13 02:18:29 2015 UTC,"They should just remove best condition entirely and raise our base gold and exp gain by whatever they think an appropriate level is to compensate. It's a silly mechanic. The only function it could serve is to encourage players to try out a range of heroes, rather than just sticking to a single team, but there are so many better ways to achieve that aim."
FutureFight,3d1z73,tegeusCromis,3,Mon Jul 13 04:41:49 2015 UTC,"I fully agree with this. It's like that old argument about ""increased chance to find items"" in the Diablo series and how % item find was just a wasted stat on gear. Just raise baselines and be done with it. Here, as you said, Best Condition really contributes very little of value, but because it's there I feel obliged to abuse the mechanic."
FutureFight,3d1z73,IrmaGoodness,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:16:08 2015 UTC,"I don't mind not having the bonus exp from Best Condition but the extra gold has been crucial with the antimatter reactor sucking up all my money.  If they do fix it I wish they'd buff the gold to the higher value and just have Best Condition affect xp.  After all, it is meant to give your less used characters a boost when you get around to using them."

I just feel like no matter what, my team always has an incredible advantage. I tend to use my Rona Ultron Vision team. Ronan handles entire 5* teams, including Vision. But all of a sudden, when my Vision faces a formidable Ronan, I still win by a considerable margin. It's just so inconsistent in the Arena.   I think the best measure is VS but I understand it's hard to get a consistent idea there as well because you can only face Level 7 Bullseye once every 4 days.

FutureFight,3d2szu,Thesparkone,2,Mon Jul 13 12:44:46 2015 UTC,"You're not really getting a fair comparison from the Arena, so I'm not sure why you think you are. The Arena is quite a bit different from other game modes. If I were to judge say, IP from facing him in the Arena, then he'd be garbage tier."
FutureFight,3d2szu,v_iral,3,Mon Jul 13 04:49:35 2015 UTC,"I don't even see why people who already made it this far are asking who's ""God tier"" in the first place. Any decently built 5* hero can handle almost everything the game can offer. I grew tired of people who have already spent enough time on the game to know who's who and which is which, repeatedly asking who the best character is like they need any more reassurance. Do we have a freaking shifting meta or something? It's all the same: the ""powerful"" characters yesterday are still ""powerful"" today, and they'd most likely still be ""powerful"" for an indefinite period of time. Keep your bubble unpopped, bud.  Not like Arena is any different since entry recharges exist.  It'd be fine if new players are the ones asking which heroes are great, and not people subtly fishing for compliments on their already finished characters again and again. I guess that's why they call it circle jerking.  PLAY AND FARM WHO YOU LIKE AND HE/SHE WILL EVENTUALLY CONQUER EVERYTHING IN THIS PVE GAME.  /rant"

FutureFight,3d2szu,chaoticheartld,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:31:55 2015 UTC,"There are some genuinely confused players out there, though they are few and far between. There are plenty of people who think their 5* Falcon is the absolute best character in the game because A) they've invested so much into him and cannot think otherwise and B) because they've took him to Arena and he soloed a team of 4* JI."
FutureFight,3d2szu,palmermarc,3,Mon Jul 13 20:50:44 2015 UTC,"As Ashy_Larry said, it is all in the fact that many high-level players run Arena on Auto with no assists used; thus it is solely a fight between character-controlled AI. This tends to give a pretty good idea of character strength. It isn't perfect, as AI uses some characters better than others (for instance, AI will use Malekith's Aether bolt first no matter if the enemy is all the way across the other side of the arena and THEN use grasp to pull them close), but it is probably the best way to judge we have.  You can use pretty much any character to beat any other character in the arena if you use them on manual. That is NOT the case if you just leave them on auto. A better character will beat you, even if they are playing on defense.  One thing to keep in mind, though, is the defensive team doesn't get ISO set activations; so no ISO shields, heals, or boosts. The attacker does always have a slight advantage because of it."
FutureFight,3d2szu,chaoticheartld,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:35:36 2015 UTC,"This tends to give a pretty good idea of character strength.   Doesn't the defending team not get their ISO 8 procs and no team bonus? That doesn't seem to give that good of an idea, to me."
FutureFight,3d2szu,toysoldierxiii,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:21:55 2015 UTC,"The thing to keep in mind is that it is more about how well a character does in the Arena in comparison to others. A low tier character can typically only beat other characters of equal rank/level. A mid-tier can beat one a rank or two/5-10 levels above them. A top-tier can take down a whole team who are 2* and 10 levels higher than themselves all on their own. A God Tier is one that will do that on attack and defense.  So, yes, even with the attacker getting a slight advantage you can still infer tier ranking from the Arena better than you can from any other mode. You just do it by comparing the characters in relation to each other's performance."
FutureFight,3d2szu,tegeusCromis,2,Tue Jul 14 00:06:46 2015 UTC,"I agree to an extent but Arena performance does roughly translate to mission boss killing and VS ability as well - the more CC, higher damage, and movement/kiting/invincibility frames the better that character will do in those modes."
FutureFight,3d2szu,Zyraz-,2,Mon Jul 13 02:09:51 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I care much more about how characters perform in PvE. It's true that a character that's god-tier in arena is bound to also be great in PvE, but there isn't an exact correlation, and it's possible to be very mediocre in arena but great in PvE."

Of course I want to 6* him, but at the cost of other characters development? Not too sure about that, hence seeking opinions. 320 bios would probably take months then |yucks|"
FutureFight,3d157y,tegeusCromis,3,Sun Jul 12 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"Where's that estimate coming from? Spidey has three farmable missions. The average should be something like 4 bios a day. So under 3 months for 6*. Sounds like a lot, but this is the current absolute end-game we're talking about."

FutureFight,3d157y,-Harute-,2,Sun Jul 12 20:32:24 2015 UTC,Depends where you are in the game. If you can do Villain Siege 9 daily then feel free to focus on your main characters since there is pretty much no other use of raising other characters from flash sales (unless you want get a high level dimension Warp device :P).
FutureFight,3d157y,tegeusCromis,2,Sun Jul 12 17:44:00 2015 UTC,"I've known many people who managed to 4/5 characters through flash sales, which was what I intended to do, until this. I have got many characters at max level at 4*, just waiting to be starred. Thing is, suppose I invest my crystals in 40 Spidey bios (with limited $ spending budget), will it be worth in the long run? Since I don't have an immediate effect by buying it right now. And to answer your question, nope didn't manage to finish VS9 yet. There, but no more characters to play with. :P"
FutureFight,3d157y,tom641,2,Sun Jul 12 17:49:10 2015 UTC,"If you can't complete VS9 yet, it makes more sense to invest in building up other heroes. Making Spidey 6*, even if you could do it instantly, is unlikely to be enough if you're currently getting to VS9 with no characters left."

FutureFight,3d1du7,Pokeiality,3,Sun Jul 12 18:51:47 2015 UTC,"A big fan of war machine in general, and the costume is a nice bonus, the stun is useful but not amazing. He's a very high tier character though, and a 10% stat boost on such a high tier character is pretty powerful.  Personally I had to have it, but your call."
FutureFight,3d1du7,TheRoonis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:54:14 2015 UTC,Is he dealing energy atk or physical atk?
FutureFight,3d1du7,TheRoonis,4,Sun Jul 12 19:05:27 2015 UTC,"Physical attack type, he has 1 energy damage skill that scales off his physical attack"
FutureFight,3d1du7,crash100200,4,Sun Jul 12 19:13:08 2015 UTC,"He deals both. His skills are all based on his physical attack but deal damage in terms of physical damage except for his 3rd skill (repulsor shot) which deals energy damage. Don't get confused, it doesnt depend on your energy attack stat so dont up that."
FutureFight,3d1du7,EdgarDom81539,3,Sun Jul 12 19:13:41 2015 UTC,"He's good... but can do without uniform.

His feather attack is wonderful."

FutureFight,3d1du7,Malthan01,2,Sun Jul 12 20:18:00 2015 UTC,"His shield throw is better then caps, does decent dps (not great but better then auto) and has a backup, no reason not to use it unlike cap"
FutureFight,3d1du7,EdgarDom81539,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:45:03 2015 UTC,"Reason I don't use it against single targets is that a single shield-throw does less damage than a standard punch unless it procs Falcon passive, and the distance he has to cover makes it less damage than just punching overall."
FutureFight,3d1du7,tegeusCromis,2,Sun Jul 12 23:02:20 2015 UTC,"I don't have Falcon's costume, but going by the numbers you've provided, no way does that make him a ""top-tier damage dealer"".

FutureFight,3d1du7,Ben882,2,Sun Jul 12 22:05:27 2015 UTC,All alts are worth it.  Let it only be for the 10% boost since it's not a trade off for anything else.

FutureFight,3d0ibk,CoherentInsanity,7,Sun Jul 12 20:53:27 2015 UTC,"Good burst but also dies too quickly. I don't want him to be a tank type like Cap because I find that play style woefully boring, but at the same time its weird for Hulk to play like a glass cannon.  Honestly should be allowed to be slightly OP given how much of a pain farming him can be, which was true ever since the soft launch. Can keep the slow movement and attack speed but needs better survivability (without sacrificing his damage role) either with a stat boost, breaking, a physical immunity proc instead of his barely noticeable passive right now, or whatever Net marble can do to make him closer to top-tier."
FutureFight,3d0ibk,BossBattleE,6,Sun Jul 12 14:19:10 2015 UTC,"I'd be okay with sightly OP but then my girl Marvel would need some love as it's arguably harder for honor tokens, especially if you don't drop crystals to buy back in. 3 honor a day against 9 chaos a day isn't fair :/"
FutureFight,3d0ibk,CoherentInsanity,6,Sun Jul 12 15:00:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Plus fix up her 5* skill so I have incentive to rank her up more. I've heard bad things about that skill.   But I'm getting OT. But speaking of late game skills, I hope Hulk gets a 6* active like Widow and Spidey soon. And I hope its some sort of leap attack, because that's yet ANOTHER thing for Hulk to be jealous of in Red Hulk. More of a character lore thing but it could also be quite beneficial, like if he were to jump completely off screen before crashing back down, then he'd have a few frames of invulnerability that the player could use in a dire moment."
FutureFight,3d0ibk,BossBattleE,3,Sun Jul 12 16:23:51 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same exact thing as you said leap attack. Gotta be off screen. Hopefully we see something like that for the green machine.
FutureFight,3d0ibk,BossBattleE,7,Sun Jul 12 17:05:28 2015 UTC,Maybe we can get a World War uni and get one of his moves to stun for a second ala Warmachine with his Iron Patriot uni. Maybe the charge? I dunno.
FutureFight,3d0ibk,CoherentInsanity,7,Sun Jul 12 14:38:20 2015 UTC,And perhaps a hit-stun for Hulk Smash.
FutureFight,3d0ibk,ziekktx,2,Sun Jul 12 14:43:02 2015 UTC,I'd be super cool with either of these plus the inherent 10% boost to defense would be a nice buffer yo Hulk's problems.
FutureFight,3d0ibk,EdgarDom81539,6,Sun Jul 12 16:17:45 2015 UTC,"I had high hopes for him, but to me his slow animations are nearly impossible to chain. That and his slow run make dodging and keeping the damage on just a pain."
FutureFight,3d0ibk,BlackDynomite33,4,Sun Jul 12 14:09:57 2015 UTC,"Really average for someone who's that hard to get. Hits hard and nothing else. No breaks, slow, easy to break and easy to damage. Wish he would be a lot more bulky. Also some of his moves leave him really vulnerable."
FutureFight,3d0ibk,Ozeagle,3,Sun Jul 12 15:31:05 2015 UTC,Hulk needs a stunning or a attack that as a fear effect attached.
FutureFight,3d0ibk,Zephyraine,4,Sun Jul 12 15:50:00 2015 UTC,"He's a throwaway character in the early rounds of VS for me, dies too quickly to be particularly useful at anything.  Definitely better options out there for Chaos tokens."
FutureFight,3d0ibk,fiesher,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:22:09 2015 UTC,He does decent against Destroyer at least. Charge -> Ground Pound 3rd skill -> Hulk Slap is a safe combo as each of the hits in this order seem to flinch Destroyer the whole time.
FutureFight,3d0ibk,Ben882,3,Wed Jul 15 00:50:50 2015 UTC,"He is a prestige character (Hard to Star up) but yet has slow animation and no ""break"" or ""stun"". Please balance him with more damage (glass cannon) or at least a fear/health back per hit sort of passive."
FutureFight,3d0ibk,yamiprem,3,Sun Jul 12 16:43:18 2015 UTC,He sucks like Blackbolt. He's supposed to be on the god tier if we relate to the comic book and aura but he's just average.  But all in all characters who can deal good physical damage aren't that many and are very useful against VS destroyer.  Also his bios are now very easy to get so he's not a prestige thing anymore. I also expect an alt in a near future and also an update of the chaos token market so I will rank him up while i can.
FutureFight,3d0ibk,Ben882,2,Mon Jul 13 01:16:38 2015 UTC,Isn't Chaos Token still the only way to get him?
FutureFight,3d0ibk,yamiprem,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:35:24 2015 UTC,"He's also an ennemy shifter.  Choas token is widely available now, but at first it was a rare currency. You would only get 50 from a win and at the time most people didnt have the power to wipe the 9 bosses."
FutureFight,3d0ibk,BrainWav,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:41:50 2015 UTC,And ally shifter too. But shifters are random.  Ok. I was unaware of Chaos changes.
FutureFight,3d0ibk,Ben882,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:45:24 2015 UTC,"If you can do all nine rounds of VS you can get 1,500 Chaos Tokens per day, which is enough for 9 Bios of your choice.    I can do 7, sometimes 8, so I average 6 bios per day, with an occasional 9.  Star-Lord is poised to be my second 4 star, and probably my second 5 star (only because Captain Marvel has a huge lead on him)."
FutureFight,3d0ibk,yamiprem,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:10:11 2015 UTC,At launch it was 50 per boss. I only ever reached 4-5 at the time so please correct me if higher boss had higher payouts. Even if you could do 9 that was just 450 token / day.  I dont recall Hulk as ally shifter. I don't think he is.

FutureFight,3d0ibk,pksullivan,2,Mon Jul 13 03:28:04 2015 UTC,"Pretty strange that the Hulk of all characters is played like a Dark Knight from the FF series in this game. His immense damage output is offset by his inability to kite or break, technically making him a char that works by sacrificing his own HP for his opponent's HP. The problem is... as the bosses get tougher, the Dark Knight strategy becomes literally street trash, as far as MFF is concerned. Most endgame bosses will have around 20 times more hp than you, and will have much less skill cooldown, if any. There is no way Hulk can ever survive long enough to deal enough damage to the opponent without getting mauled first. He doesn't have an invincibility skill like Captain America or Hulkbuster, has only slightly above average bulk, can't kite very well due to his mediocre speed and huge frame, and none of his skills break to disrupt his opponents while having a large still-frame after the skill damage went through. I, and I'm sure many others on this place too, expected the Strongest There Is. However, MFF gave us a husk of its in-universe self - a mediocre, wimpy hero who is a lot below average. Moved onto Star-Lord as soon as I got him for Arena combat percentage boost. Never looked back again."
FutureFight,3d0ibk,drakelb,2,Wed Jul 15 05:01:21 2015 UTC,"How Hulk doesn't have the highest base physical damage in the game, I don't understand."
FutureFight,3d0ibk,crash100200,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:44:49 2015 UTC,"Completely agree! Hulk should be at least be able to facetank. At worst his damage output should be insane, so as to balance out his squishyness, OR the opposite maybe his damage is high but DPS is really low and his tanking is really high. Some compromise. Instead we get a squishy kind of powerful Hulk that despite the bonus from the recently added Anger Management Team UP, still is just mediocre at best."

He pops in, wipes out sometimes as many as 8 of the enemy minions in one blow and then is gone. I actually like using Iron man as my main with Hulk as my striker, the combo seems to work well enough - not that I particularly love any of these three heros (thor included)."

His weakness appears when against a boss... Well, I just switch in another character when facing a hard boss. I must say that playing in VIP 4 with recovery while switching changes a lot the evaluation of characters in this game."
FutureFight,3d0ibk,Ileb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:01:48 2015 UTC,"How does it change the evaluation of characters? Sure, the heal might make a mediocre hero more useable, but it would have made a good hero even better.  As for mob-clearing, Hulk is good at that, but so are lots of other heroes. Many of them are also good against bosses. Poor Hulk just can't compete."
FutureFight,3d0ibk,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:30:48 2015 UTC,"It can change evaluation of characters, depending on how normally each person evaluates them (character may be good in arena, not good in VS and average in missions or bonus missions, etc.). I compare hulk to spider-man, weakness in defense and can easily die, but extreme power when they use skills. If you can heal them back by just tagging out, they will be used as burst damage, then rest & heal, burst damage, repeat. If they don't heal (no VIP bonus) then u better use another character that can survive the battle."
FutureFight,3d0ibk,malach1constant,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:29:08 2015 UTC,"Sure, I agree that VIP 4 makes heroes like Hulk more viable. But there are still heroes out there who do everything Hulk does, but better, and those are still the heroes which will get used by power-gamers. If I have Ultron, there is little reason (apart from team-ups etc.) to use Hulk, VIP 4 or not. Ultron does an equally good job at clearing mobs and is a better boss-killer and can take a hit way better. So what's Hulk for?"
FutureFight,3d0ibk,tegeusCromis,0,Mon Jul 13 06:40:26 2015 UTC,"It would definitely benefit bad characters (especially squishy ones like Hulk) more than good characters.

FutureFight,3d0ibk,yamiprem,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:49:52 2015 UTC,I've recognised that the evaluation changes somewhat. My point is simply that the evaluation never changes so much that an otherwise inferior hero jumps ahead of an otherwise superior one. VIP 4 can only close the gap partially.
FutureFight,3d0ibk,Justikyzer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:05:39 2015 UTC,"I see.  They could argue this post is not about comparing more so than just a general evaluation of the individual hero. Which then VIP 4 will have more of an effect when comparing to someone else's evaluation without VIP 4 of the same hero.  But IMO, VIP 4 doesn't skew my perspective as such.

I know on the D-rifts they changed the wording to High rather than very high and so on down the list. Nothing's bugged but possibly adjusted. I think they saw everyone just ran stage 4 and Bios rained from the sky so they tweaked it to reward stage 5 more and stage 4 less or something like that."

FutureFight,3d0gdr,crash100200,3,Sun Jul 12 13:44:55 2015 UTC,I would save until an 80/100 bio deal. Uniforms you can get later
FutureFight,3d0gdr,Wizmaxman,3,Sun Jul 12 14:05:20 2015 UTC,I would bring vision to 4* as soon as possible to open more elites and improve your general game performance. Any of his flash sales or his team pack with War Machine would be a good choice.

FutureFight,3d0gdr,neilliyo,2,Sun Jul 12 14:06:56 2015 UTC,I think early on is the best time to buy bios. That's when getting a new rank or two can seriously amp up your ability to progress in story mode. That immediately increases your bio farming options as well as your gold income.

FutureFight,3d044j,AmusedLeviathan,2,Sun Jul 12 11:14:58 2015 UTC,Ya that leadership bonus is great.
FutureFight,3d044j,eak125,4,Sun Jul 12 13:49:11 2015 UTC,not really sure bout wasp but star-lord's a beast. i have him at 5 stars now and currently maining him but just so you know he doesn't shine till he gets his 3* skill. he solos most of my arenas and can solo high levels of dock ock in villain siege as well! plus his leadership is so good if you're one of those vision/warmachine/yellowjacket fans!
FutureFight,3d044j,santiagorilla,2,Sun Jul 12 11:15:17 2015 UTC,How's his 5 star skill? Does it hit hard? Does it chain nicely with his skills? Im close to getting him to 5 stars :D
FutureFight,3d044j,crash100200,2,Sun Jul 12 13:46:32 2015 UTC,It hits way hard and it does a cap's shield style bounce when there are more enemies only it's 10x better than the shield throw in damage and number of hits. Even on just one enemy it hits ~3 times.
FutureFight,3d044j,SageofLogic,2,Sun Jul 12 16:11:42 2015 UTC,"Is that advisable in vs? Say against ronan, what skill combination would be safe? I usually spam 3 as soon as its available and use 1 right after, then just use 2 when he's casting or far from me. How does the 5 star skill fit in there :X"
FutureFight,3d044j,crash100200,2,Sun Jul 12 17:25:56 2015 UTC,"Starlord is not a consistent combo kind of character. He's a kiter. You kite around your opponent lobbing in gravity grenades and using the hadron cannon to get damage in and break them and toss in his 5* whenever it gets off cooldown. You then use his 3* to dodge any attacks or combos the opponent tries to break out at you, or in VS to dodge things like lasers. His cannon move also can cancel out of his 3* move very consistently so you can pick where you stop your movement animation."
FutureFight,3d044j,SageofLogic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:58:00 2015 UTC,This. Yeah i guess i really just throw his 5* when it's off. You really see it shine on stages with more 2 or more bosses. I'd say it's really one of the better 5* skills damage wise given the proper conditions. His 1+2 is really just there for mob clearing although his 2 does make opponents flinch/ministun so i guess you can use that to cancel enemy attacks too. And that 3* you can leave him on autoplay cuz of that 3* the only downside is he tends to use his 3* with least priority on auto or maybe that's just me. But hey 37.5% more damage thanks to his mastery is no joke my energy attack stat on him is at 4957 and i'm still using the Grasp Weak Point iso set!
FutureFight,3d044j,santiagorilla,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:23:19 2015 UTC,"I don't have the 5*, but I want to point out that against Ronan, it's fine to have skills with wind-up and no place in a smooth chain. Ronan does a lot of standing around awkwardly while using or preparing to use his own skills. Even if a skill does not fit into your chain, you can use it on its own during one of those moments."
FutureFight,3d044j,tegeusCromis,3,Sun Jul 12 20:27:43 2015 UTC,Wasp's 3rd skill is a buff. A self-buff until multiplay is implemented. Go for star lord!! Wasp is relatively easy to farm in yellowjacket's special mission. You cant farm starlord anywhere else :D starlord is super fun at 3 stars but wasp is already good at 1 or 2 stars sooo... :D
FutureFight,3d044j,crash100200,3,Sun Jul 12 11:14:18 2015 UTC,I feel Wasp is better but Star Lord is token-exclusive. Go for him.

FutureFight,3d044j,ArekkusuRin,2,Sun Jul 12 11:36:27 2015 UTC,Hands down wasp is better her skills hit well very easy to use also when she uses normal hits she has a tendency to step back a bit so she kites very well also she moves and hits very fast once u go 4 star u can silence other people stop there combos and finally her leadership is also pretty good allowing u to have different team combos

Starlord is more DPS and mob clearing though he has 3 attacks that work great on bosses. Wasp is a status inducing boss harasser/killer.

FutureFight,3czw72,santiagorilla,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:16:33 2015 UTC,"It seems to be the ""known thing"" that Marvel is forbidding Fantasic Four and X-Men characters because the film rights are held by Fox.  Like a lot of things that ""everyone knows"" it's not exactly true.  Yes, Marvel is limiting their marketing for those characters.  Yes, Marvel do get a say in what characters go into the games.  But they don't FORBID any.  When a movie or show is coming out, Marvel can and does say ""tie in this character"".  And the developers have to do it, but at the same time they want to do it as the movie/show publicity works for them as well, driving sales.  But the only thing - the ONE thing - stopping certain characters from being seen is licensing fees.  The companies pay a licensing fee and profit share per character used.  Marvel wont stop them using a character, if they pay the fees, but the developers must weigh the license fee (and for more popular characters the fee is higher) against expected sales and marketing.  Tl;dr?  Money."
FutureFight,3czw72,dearbluey,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:46:01 2015 UTC,But it's exactly true and that's what Tom Breevoort even said. They're vetoing any thing that could help the X-men and the FF.

That pack will give you a 4 star very strong hero to go with the outfit, and with the ultron pack you can only use 1 at a time so some of those purchases will not get you quite as much mileage.  hope this helps."
FutureFight,3czttx,Malthan01,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:34:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The Ultron pack is really bad value. If you want an Ultron costume, just get one. Anti-combat is best for VS and arena."

FutureFight,3czttx,rikiking16,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:01:50 2015 UTC,"depends on what your current roster looks like. If you can run giant man's special mission stage 4 in about a minute's time, I would say buy the costume and save 1750 tokens. He can be 4 starred in as little as 3 days. Ant Man is considerably harder to farm, but also seemingly weaker than Giant Man so his pack would be more cost efficient in the long run."
FutureFight,3czttx,coju3,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:51:57 2015 UTC,"I'll second this. I should have a 5 star Giant Man in three more days, just farming him and not buying his package. Decided to buy his costume since he's advancing so fast."

Other Packages are still available with no expiry dates."
FutureFight,3czttx,swiftsack,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:02:47 2015 UTC,"This depends entirely on how your roster is. Do you plan on investing a ton into Ultron and bring him into 6 stars ASAP with the best uniforms for each class? If so, get the pack; the 30 bios will speed up your farming. However if Ultron is just meh to you then get the Giant/Ant package simply because it starts you off with an instant 4 star. The value of the packs is actually up to your preferences. Simply, if you love Ultron (well who doesn't) get the pack, if not jump for the new packages because Ultron is so damn farmable now."
FutureFight,3czttx,Wizmaxman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:32:32 2015 UTC,Giant ant is a waste of crystals imo.   You can farm up 150 bios in 3-4 days. I'd say just buy his uniform.   Save your crystals for deals on hero's that are harder to farm. Giant man is the easiest farm in the game

FutureFight,3cz407,imjms737,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:54:38 2015 UTC,Basically almost all blast heroes are energy attackers. (War Machine is an exception)  A simple way to check which damage they deal is by seeing what their 1st attack gear boosts.
FutureFight,3cz407,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:11:01 2015 UTC,"That is not a reliable way of checking. Many heroes use energy attack as their primary stat, yet deal physical damage with their basic attacks. There is no way to tell by just looking at the stats the game shows you; you need to find out by experience (or, you know, asking on the forum)."
FutureFight,3cz407,imjms737,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:28:51 2015 UTC,"Really? I had the impression that characters with physical attack always deal physical damage, and energy attack characters deal energy damage with their basic attacks.  With that said, yes, there are physical attack characters that deal energy damage with specific skills, and vice versa.  (Ex: WM = physical attack, but has energy damage dealing Repulsor Shot; Ultron = energy attack, but has physical damage dealing Robotic Slam; Vision = energy attack, but has physical damage dealing Physical Disruption...)"
FutureFight,3cz407,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:53:56 2015 UTC,"NM has claimed that in the past, but it is simply not true for most heroes. You can verify this for yourself by taking Ultron into a VS Destroyer stage. His basic attacks damage the Destroyer just fine."

FutureFight,3cyaxa,SJArcher89,2,Sat Jul 11 21:47:33 2015 UTC,A lot of it is personal preference but I can tell you what I'm trying.   I'm using dodge on YJ because his gear already has dodge in it. Also I like making annoying arena characters.   Crit on GM. I'm going full attack stats and iso on him  Antman could be dodge but I only need one dodgy hero so I'll probably run crit on him too.
FutureFight,3cyaxa,Gpaint,2,Sat Jul 11 21:52:18 2015 UTC,"Second question first - yes they do, the 5th stage drops the best of them.  For the first question I want you to run any mission your level or higher then fight an arena battle and pay close attention. See all those dodges? That is damage flushed down the toilet. Now imagine life when every character gets +10% more dodge from alliances and the craziness that is dodge special gear. I made the decision to load everyone up with ignore dodge from Hawkeye's Rift (just a matter of farming them now) - I have no problem losing to others, I do have a problem losing to RNG.  IMO of course; and I'll probably keep the elementals on their heroes (Goblin, Rulk, etc)."

FutureFight,3cxm0w,toysoldierxiii,3,Sat Jul 11 18:50:23 2015 UTC,"I finally found someone that I can ask! Is his rank 5 skill the one that was shown in his trailer where he becomes a giant and stomps all over? How was it? That's the one and only reason why I'm farming him mad. That's the coolest skill in the game, IMO."
FutureFight,3cxm0w,yellising,2,Sun Jul 12 02:39:35 2015 UTC,"Yes and yes it is the coolest in the game. It is also what he does for the team Pym team attack too so you can double it up - not much lives through two.  At only 40 without anything invested in the skill, minimal isos, and only 3/5 mastery stars (so ~3400 attack) it hits equal leveled neutral mission enemies (stage 4 specials, dailies, and rifts) for around 5K. 5 times."

Clear tickets for anything that won't give decent EXP for characters being levelled up. For be this usually means anything below chapter 5 for elites and chapter 7 in normal stages. Finish dailies, bonus missions during breaks. Villain siege can be done throughout the day since no energy is used for it. Normal missions are mostly done for daily achiements unless some items need to be farmed. Split these up and you should cover them all :). As for special missions, you may need to make some time for them if you can."

This will serve you through the first 3-4 fights at least.  After that it gets a little more dicey, with the enemies hitting harder and having more health.  At that point you'll want specific heroes for each boss to be leveled further.  I'm sure that you're going to get a bunch of suggestions in here soon. :)  Once you have those suggestions, start leveling them up together - run the hardest missions (specials) you can with one maxed character, one character you're dragging up to level 30, and one character you're pushing to 40.  That way you can improve several characters at once and you'll find that as you do the villain siege levels (the lower ones) will require less and less characters to beat, letting you whittle down the bigger ones further.  Take this with a grain of salt - that's what I'm doing, and may not work for everyone.  With my current roster, which is...not quite where I'm aiming for yet, I can clear up to 6, and get 7 to about 10% health before I lose."
FutureFight,3cwzol,dearbluey,2,Sat Jul 11 14:53:56 2015 UTC,"I worked on that initially, too. Had every character and at least level 20 with level 10 skills. Average at level 25 though, save for a few 40s and soon-to-be 40s"
FutureFight,3cwzol,Trunksshe,2,Sat Jul 11 20:17:52 2015 UTC,"Venom is a beast against Destroyer. For Ronan, just pit him against a speed character who is able to escape the slow traps, I find that BW does deliciously against him.   Once you get beyond stage 6, you are gonna hate Doc Ock and Bullseye more.  Usually I get my lvl 25-30 characters with at least 5/5/5/5 gear and lvl 15 skills to clear up to about stage 4 or so, then from there on, it's based on each specific villain."
FutureFight,3cwzol,zencronus,2,Sat Jul 11 15:54:35 2015 UTC,"For destroyer most combat characters are good I use my 4* groot with recovery special gear, he can 75%+ level 8 destroyer for ronan personally I like to use speed characters like green goblin or whoever kites good"
FutureFight,3cwzol,ssj4ric,2,Sat Jul 11 16:19:52 2015 UTC,"Here are my favorites I've found vs each boss (haven't really used any ant-man chars yet):  Bullseye:  Vision, Malakeith, Winter Soldier, Red Skull, Yondu, Starlord (don't forget bullseye gets damaged by the exploding bots too) (edit:  War Machine too)  Destroyer:  Any physical damage dealer (you get used to dodging the rain of lag), SpiderMan and Green Goblin have moves that will stop the rain of fire  Doc Oc:  Pretty much any ranged character, especially Green Goblin, I actually usually save hulkbuster for doc oc since he can dish out serious dmg when his physical immunity procs, Black Panther is pretty good too with his spear spam to interrupt the specials  Ronan:  I like Rocket (once you get the mines), Ronan himself is really good in a mirror match, Destroyer has great combo action, Black Widow is really good as well, although I'll usually try to save her for Doc Oc for the shock effect, surprisingly I found punisher to be pretty effective vs him as well"
FutureFight,3cwzol,renegadebebop,2,Sat Jul 11 17:15:04 2015 UTC,"Wasp destroys Doc, YJ destroys basically everything except Destroyer. Antman did a good job against Ronan and Bullseye. Haven't used Giantman yet."
FutureFight,3cwzol,Jplato09,2,Sat Jul 11 21:31:38 2015 UTC,"Heres my go to for harder ones:  Bullseye  = warmachine with a slow resist gear  Ronan =  ronan (my ronan is only 38 and not the best geared, he can solo #6)  Destoryer = Gamora  Dr oct = cry myself to sleep (but seriously, i tend to throw iron man, vision, cap marval at him just because those are the best i have, not sure if there is better)"
FutureFight,3cwzol,Wizmaxman,2,Sat Jul 11 17:26:46 2015 UTC,"Well its good to get a bunch of really strong characters to take the harder stages, while leaving the weaker ones for the lower ones, mabye saving a few just in case you couldn't defeat a boss in time.  Good matchups for these bosses:  Ronan (The easiest one): Black Widow, Green Goblin, Vision, War Machine, Spider-man, Venom, Black Panther, Ultron, Destroyer and a lot of other characters perform pretty well as long as they can break skills and do skill combos.  Destroyer (quite easy): Venom, Spider-man, Black Panther, War Machine Daredevil, Punisher, and physical attackers who are able to break in case he dashes at you or fires his beam.  Bullseye (can be very annoying): Black Panther, Vision, War Machine, Ultron, Destroyer, and quicker characters with break skills since he can dash back and throw his knives in the middle of your skill combo.  Doctor Octopus (Your HP can go from 100-0 in less than a second of you are not careful): Vision, Iron Man, Green Goblin, Spider-man, Venom, Destoryer, War Machine, Captain Marvel, Wasp and Yellowjacket are best for this stage. Characters need to be able to break his skills since he does a lot of damage by himself.   Quick strategies:  Ronan: Avoid Slow fields and use a skill combo whenever you can, since he isn't too much of a threat unless you are slowed.  Destoryer: Dodge his attacks before starting yours so you know what he will do next. When the meteors appear, just run until they're gone or switch characters if you are using more than one.  Bullseye: Never run in a straight line away from him, always go around to be safe. When robots appear, force them to begin their countdown before face Bullseye again so they don't throw of your targeting.  Doc Oc: Only use a full skill combo when you know its safe, staying in one place while doing a combo puts you in grave danger if the timing is wrong. To be extra safe, you can wait for the lines to appear so you know where it is safe to attack."

I Did some dmg tests on the same mission by using the same fire skill repeatedly but switched leadership between rulk/gr when repeating the mission to see the dmg difference  Results: with GR as leader, GR's ""Chains Albaze"" skill kept doing 8.5-9.5k dmg (without crits). And with Rulk as leader, that same GR skill yielded similliar dmg results. Too similiar than you would expect from a ""+%20 dmg increase"".  so from these tests that I've done, it seems that his leadership really doesn't work/stack with the fire special gear.

It's not even something that people think about because 1) Not everyone has 6* and 2) Not everyone autoplays arena especially not against 6* because of point (1).  The point is that a 6* Spidey can be beat in the arena by using Autoplay. That's it. We KNOW he can be beat by MANUALLY playing but how often does everyone autoplay and beat him at 6*? This video just helps to show that, that's all. I don't understand why people are questioning this as though the OP is downplaying Spidey when it's no different to a post showing that you can get an X20 bios in Dimension Shop."

I want people to know that he is beatable and as the game involves there will be more and more characters keepable of beating him. No hate, just presenting another side of the argument.   P.S. I am not even discussing how strong he is in vs or ch 8, that's a completely different topic for me"

We've seen with falcon that they can get new attacks, fx, and animations with a uniform change.  I mean, would a Danny ketch Ghost Rider be looked down upon if it was a new uniform? I doubt it.

(Though you can ""kill"" the boss yourself and only take 5% of the alliance wide health bar so you can still get rewards from the fight and one person can't carry the entire group)"

FutureFight,3cvmxl,Spedwards,7,Sat Jul 11 04:09:47 2015 UTC,"Lots of reasons. To name a few:   Unless you magically connect everyone to the same LAN, there's going to be a crap tonne of lag. It's resource heavy. It's network data heavy. (Goodbye playing on mobile)"
FutureFight,3cvmxl,Nueko,3,Sat Jul 11 04:19:33 2015 UTC,"lol you worried for a feature thats RARELY come in mobile, realtime pvp is impossible im sure NM understand this. Real time raid however is plausible and there's a few workaround way to do that and frankly im hoping for that, since currently game feel kinda 'forever alone' and abit social feature wouldn't hurt."
FutureFight,3cvmxl,Spedwards,2,Sat Jul 11 06:04:51 2015 UTC,"The best implementation of realtime PvP on a mobile device that I've seen was in Fates Forever and they still had some flaws. One of which being the game was massive (file size).  Not 100% what raids are (I haven't a decent idea) but if they're what I think they are, they'll be fine and I don't have an issue with that."
FutureFight,3cvmxl,AweKartik777,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:35:01 2015 UTC,"I'll give an example of raids. Say you're fighting a super boss in VS with crapton of HP (and much stronger than current bosses) then you can party up in real time with other players around the world (either random, friends in game, or the alliance members) to defeat the boss together. It's like an ally dimension shifter kind of thing except that instead of AI, the ally will be a real player so he'll get his own rewards, he'll probably play and have better stats than AI and if the raids work as intended then there will be many players you can take on raids at the same time."
FutureFight,3cvmxl,Spedwards,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:31:22 2015 UTC,That would be extremely network heavy. A tonne of data on our devices and a hell of a lot of traffic going through Netmarble's servers. For a desktop or platform game I can see this working but not for mobile.
FutureFight,3cvmxl,Spedwards,2,Sat Jul 11 10:52:21 2015 UTC,"Actually a prime example of a working raid on mobile is Brave Brigade. Basically, a boss with tremendous amount of HP appears at a certain period of time. Players will then be able to join in the boss raid which uses a crapton of energy. The boss fight will still be single player, but the HP will be synced amongst all players. For example, players have already damaged the boss 30% of hp and when you join the fight, he will have 70% hp remaining. In essence, there is no need for any 'real time' player data that needs to be transmitted except for the Boss's HP."
FutureFight,3cvmxl,AweKartik777,2,Sat Jul 11 13:48:21 2015 UTC,That's actually a pretty good way of doing it.
FutureFight,3cvmxl,AsteroidMiner,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:53:29 2015 UTC,"I was just referring to what raids are. Their definition is different depending on different games. For example in WoW (World of Warcraft) raids are conducted with guilds with about 30 members or so, while say if it's added in FF it can be anywhere from 1-3 members for less lag and network problems. I think even one extra player would suffice if each player had their three characters."
FutureFight,3cvmxl,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:40:02 2015 UTC,"Not 100% what raids are   In this form of games usually Raids are a bunch of levels where the mobs have increased HP and stats and players in a guild take turns attacking the stage.   I've seen this form of Raiding implemented in Heroes Charge, much like a shared Villain Siege for all."
FutureFight,3cvmxl,Spedwards,2,Sat Jul 11 16:06:26 2015 UTC,"All good points, but eh, maybe they'll have the good sense to make it totally optional/attached to meaningless rewards."

FutureFight,3cvmxl,ziekktx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:15:22 2015 UTC,"Or perhaps the possible beginning of the Age of Pay2Win? I think Netmarble deserves a chance if they do implement PVP since they at least got the single player F2P model right at least, but that also means they need to do some serious review on Special Gears and Character balance when the time comes. However, some players are still unable to imagine the situation of realtime P2P being imbalanced with the current state of dodge special gears and would go so far as to even hope for skill cooldown special gears."

FutureFight,3cvs0q,SageofLogic,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:10:33 2015 UTC,Ant-Man is a great movie. It's in the same class of fun as Guardians of the Galaxy. I can't wait to see it again.
FutureFight,3cvs0q,pksullivan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:52:25 2015 UTC,So it might be good. But that middle sentence is blasphemy. Nothing can be that good if it's about Scott Lang and Hank Pym unless they're completely different characters from the comics. Though I guess in Scott's case that just means having character at all.
FutureFight,3cvlre,EchoRespite,4,Sat Jul 11 03:38:02 2015 UTC,"You're a little bit crazy, and I like that. I do have to confess that most of my resources have gone into funding bad guys, because villains, like blondes, have way more fun.   I do admittedly invest in the unanimously powerful heroes because as much as I love Loki, he's never going to be as helpful as Gamora in VS.  Edit: I will happily surrender use of 75% of this game's heroes for any iteration of the Phoenix or Magneto. For real, Spiderman will never see the light of day if I'm allowed to swallow planets and shoot bullets with my mind."

Carnage we may see. I'm hoping for Zemo and Dormammu when the movies come out (Zemo I am hoping would be added to a Civil War update even if he's not in it just because he's a Cap Villain) And maybe we'll see some more Inhumans characters in the future as Agents of SHIELD delves further into it."
FutureFight,3cw3s9,Malthan01,6,Sat Jul 11 07:04:31 2015 UTC,"The only thing I've noticed that's new with Destroyer now is that if you get hit by his rushes you get stunned, pretty sure that didn't happen before.    Also, maybe it's just me but the robots in Bullseye stage do more damage now when you get hit by their explosions."

I feel like it's easier to read Destroyer now, or maybe it's because his pattern is so set (two rushes, one beam). And I'm pretty sure break works fine, or at least flinching does.

FutureFight,3cw3s9,IrmaGoodness,2,Sat Jul 11 07:45:20 2015 UTC,"yeah,  the rush kinda catches and pulls you with a stun at the end.  makes it harder to fudge if you get caught by the corner.  i felt like ronan wasnt flinching but maybe i was mistaken, i kinda feel like ronan got a armor/damage buff which to be fair he probably needed."

FutureFight,3cvtom,ign-Dextr0,3,Sat Jul 11 05:51:12 2015 UTC,"JI has always been a strong and easily farmable team, not an OP one. CO has been better from the start, as have a number of WM-led combinations. And obviously Ronan and friends is stronger than any of those. So if you're right that Team Pym is genuinely OP, I'd say it's the new Ronan and friends, not the new JI, which is middle-1st-tier at best."

FutureFight,3cwa7q,ConcealedTerror,5,Sat Jul 11 08:44:20 2015 UTC,The look at it seems to suggest that he didn't beef up the 6th skill (wrecking web) of Spider-Man where there should be a high phys damage of 375%. There is a reason for them to add his 6th skill first along with Black Widow's.
FutureFight,3cwa7q,Sho1va,-5,Sat Jul 11 11:56:13 2015 UTC,If u take a better look u will see that ultron jumped out of the area of effect right before it hit
FutureFight,3cwa7q,Sho1va,5,Sat Jul 11 12:56:57 2015 UTC,"Both of you had the dodge gear. Your Ultron dodged his 6th skill. I am not much a fan of Spider-Man because it is known fact that his defense is naturally weak despite the high damage physical hits. With Ultron's uniform Mark 3 that's popular among Ultron fans, it does deal with speed heroes like spider-man. Now with web resist, SpiderMan is already a bye bye case. However Spider-Man has a lot of fans. That's why they put his 6th skill highest at 375% than Vision's 313%. If a level 25 skill and level 50 Ultron can beat a full-skill level 50 spider-man then a lot of spidey fans are going to bomb netmarble. That's why I suspect that guy 'badsituation' didn't have full skill on his spiderman."
FutureFight,3cwa7q,ihavespeedforce,-2,Sat Jul 11 14:37:46 2015 UTC,"That guy has like 20 6* U think he doesn't have full skills?

FutureFight,3cwa7q,neilliyo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:52:25 2015 UTC,"ConcealedTerror: I think I am 'ConcealedDefeat'. You are probably right. He may have full skills given the amount of money he can afford to spend in the game. People loves Spider-Man, there is no denying it. But hard truth is that he isn't that great in MFF. So does Capt America and my favourite IronMan. I have pumped enough muscle in IronMan and I have done my best. Even War Machine far excels IronMan in game. Whilst my favourite is IronMan, I still observe other heroes and build them up."

I'll take videos of Spidey getting beat any day over the typical tell me what to do before I touch a button threads or the celebratory threads. Based on the sheer amount of opinions on ultron and spiderman this was a submission that adds to community rather than detract from it.

FutureFight,3cwa7q,andaleo,0,Sat Jul 11 09:36:27 2015 UTC,Daredevil > Spider-Man.  Punisher I'll agree with but the point is that Ultron can take Spider-Man. You'r missing the point bud.
FutureFight,3cwa7q,andaleo,5,Sat Jul 11 09:43:07 2015 UTC,Ultron can defeat spider-man and vise versa everything happens when playing against mob.
FutureFight,3cwa7q,_MaRsT_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:15:06 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the point.  The Game is on Auto Play. Meaning that the whole ""player controlled team will win"" or ""whoever manually fights mob will win"" argument doesn't work here. Which means theoretically, whoever has the better tier characters and better team bonus will win.  Spiderman is considered top tier and yet got beaten by Ultron which is also good but not top tier or as widely accepted as Spiderman is. The Uniform Bonus don't matter because Spiderman himself has 3X Team Bonus on his side which will counter the 10% stat increase on Ultron. On top of that, Spiderman has a new 6* skill which is clearly shown in the video. Luckily for Ultron, he managed to dodge it of course."
FutureFight,3cwa7q,Thesparkone,5,Sat Jul 11 14:10:35 2015 UTC,You're wrong the uniform acutally adds 30% advantage. The enemies of kingpin adds much less than that.
FutureFight,3cwa7q,Thesparkone,3,Sat Jul 11 16:40:38 2015 UTC,So you're saying that if he takes off the uniform and fights that Spider-Man without the team bonus he'd still win?
FutureFight,3cwa7q,Spedwards,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:40:14 2015 UTC,"He might. I can't say for sure due to the fact that the currently broken 40% dodge gears are really critical in determining the winner too, but in this video Ultron had at least half HP left after he downed Spiderman. Assuming he takes off his costume and Spiderman has less team bonus, he may still win simply because some of Ultron's attacks move him out of Spiderman's attack hitboxes including the 6* skill.  The point of the video is just to show that Spiderman is not a surefire way to win everything when not fought manually. It is a common belief that due to Spiderman's web stun, invulnerability from time spent outside the screen and high damage that it should be able to kill stuff before being killed. Of course you may say that "" Oh sure, but who plays Autoplay in Arena when they can get 100% victory by manual play"", and you're prob right but there are ppl who do and this definitely proves a point that nobody will actually experiment; the point that Spiderman can be defeated through autoplay but not everybody cares enough to experiment or admit it, myself included."
FutureFight,3cwa7q,Goodsituation,3,Sat Jul 11 15:24:09 2015 UTC,"I think you're underestimating the uniform, 10% bonuses to attack and defense and then another 10% attack and defense against speed on top of that.  EoK has what like 5% to attack, defense, dodge, HP and 9% to crit? I'll take the uniform over the team bonuses every day."
FutureFight,3cwa7q,EXZonic,6,Sat Jul 11 15:56:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. But if you notice you proved him wrong and he conpletely shifted gears and talked about something else. Sadly, this argument will never be won or lost by anyone friend. Only perpetuate into grief"
FutureFight,3cwa7q,Zephyraine,0,Sat Jul 11 16:45:26 2015 UTC,"Again, it still doesnt change the fact that Ultron completely avoids Spiderman's 6* skill from Autoplaying. Autoplaying makes it seem like the match is scripted, the AI will make the same moves and positioning 99% of the time meaning because the AI never changes the order of execution of the skills in Autoplay. This means that there are certain critical hits that Ultron will completely evade while other characters may be subjected to.  Now that we established that Ultron can evade certain Spidey's heavy hits, talking about removal of the uniform: if RNGesus is on Ultron's side for dodging as well as Bloodthirst, Ultron can still gain the upper hand. If not, Spiderman can still beat him up without Ultron's uniform. But it still stands that Ultron has a chance against him which comes back to the WHOLE point of this video and thread: Spiderman is not the God Tier that is 100% win during autoplay/Spidey can beat you up all the time unless you manual kite. And is probably POSSIBLE for Ultron beat up Spidey on Autoplay WITH or WITHOUT his uniform.   It's more for awareness rather than anything else. Personally for me, I'm neither a big fan or hater for Spidey but at least now I'm aware that such a thing is possible with or without a uniform. My initial impression of Spidey was just as OP said, gotta beat him by breaking his heavy hitting moves/kite him manually. For those who are already aware, good for you. No need for any hating or unnecessary downvoting. It's just info sharing and awareness here people. It's not even a competitive game by any means in the end."

I would recommend getting giant man to try him, he shows up as an ally shifter on his own level so with an energy refill you can easily farm him in a day if you don't have him yet, but I will say you can get antman and wasp while you farm yj, and wasp especially is great for vs and had a very strong leader skill if you don't have her yet."

FutureFight,3curdo,toysoldierxiii,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:27:36 2015 UTC,"Most of us have been playing for quite a while. Aside from the easily farmable bios from special missions, people usually get bios from flash sales or just pure grinding and patience from elites."
FutureFight,3curdo,crash100200,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:26:32 2015 UTC,"We have just played longer than most people as well as spending crystals smartly. Don't waste crystals on flash sales on bios that can be farmed easily with time. Yes a x60 Black Widow looks good but she has 3 stages to farm from, just be patient.   Also focus on a small team until they're the rank/level you want. I started from Vision/Ultron/Destroyer, then Ronan/Nebula/Malekith. They're all 5 stars level 45 now and I'm working on Yellow Jacket/Starlord/War Machine. I passed on so many deals because they're not flash sales on the team im currently focusing on (passed on angela, black cat, black bolts, black panther, loki, etc).  The biggest thing though is you HAVE to play every day and be consistent in what you're doing each day. For example do not use all your energy on special missions one day then level up on normal missions the next day then go for dimension rifts the following day. As for me, all my energy from recharge/assembly points/achievements are going towards Yellow Jacket special stage, I'm leaving elite stages/rifts/ on the backburner. If i have energy left to do some great, if not oh well. As a result, I already have 3 Star Yellow Jacket almost 4, 2 star wasp and 2 star antman"

FutureFight,3curdo,pksullivan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:48:24 2015 UTC,"Been playing a while. The special missions and the shifters are a huge help. It was very slow going for a while.   Do your daily achievements to get the 25 crystals a day. Try to place in the arena; those crystals can help out a lot. If you've got $4 a month to spend, get Tony's Stash because those crystals REALLY help out. Then spend your crystals wisely - watch the flash sales while you have crystals to spend, wait for something to come up for a hero you want to level."

I still don't know if Ultron or Ronan is going to end up being my first 6 we will see by the end of next week I guess.  Farming for 5*s if they're not in the special tab is a huge pain, imo."
FutureFight,3curdo,Blitqz21l,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:48:07 2015 UTC,"depending on your level, the special mission characters are the easiest to farm, meaing the GotG, and Ant-man.  I'd say the Ant-man bios are probably the easiet to come by.  Once you get a character up there, it makes it easier to level up other heroes as well as you run your highest as lead and can bring along a 1 or 2 lowbies to level up depending on the level of the mission you are running.  Basicaly, in the special missions, you have a 10 entry limit.  But once you get 5 entries on a single mission (as long as no on dies), you unlock an unlimited run for 1/2 hour.  Thus you can run that mission as many times as you can in that half hour.  Granted that can take a ton of energy, so be prepared.  As an example, I ran the Giant Man special mission today.  Did all of them on stage 4, running my 5* vision as lead.  In each of the 5 times to get to unlimited, I got 6 and 7 respectively.  Then during both unlimited runs, 19 bios per half hour.  Thus a total of 51.  Granted, I'm Shield lvl 46 so I have a total energy of 95 and running thru that many times in half an hour takes 90 energy.  Giant man is also unique in that in his special mission runs he is an ally shifter every time.  Granted, the shifter bio doesn't drop every time, but in each half hour, I did 15 runs and got 19 total bios each time.  Thus, I'd recommend at whatever level you are, run these missions at the hardest level you can auto-play thru the fastest to maximize you time in unlimited sessions.  Outside that, I'd say most people with a lot of 5* characters have spent a least some cash on the game.  Likely 1 1650 crystal pack with the free double bonus for 3300 crystals, as well as Starks pack (esp this).  The Stark pack is like $4 and nets you 2400 crystal in a month.  you get 200 initiall and an extra 75 per day for a month.  And use those crystals to only target sales on character you absolutely want or extremely rare heroes like Malekith."

Anyway, Venom and CM are not threats at all. Break/stun Spiderman as he uses the three-hit web and avoid attacking when he leaps off screen for the web swing since he'll be invulnerable. You might even be able to run off and create distance when he does this.  /u/dtwn's right, it's all down to timing. The dive kick/web shot to the ground he does puts him behind you so if you hit a skill too soon it'll miss. Take time to adjust and turn around or use an AoE skill to punish him when he lands. Ronan's Arbitration is especially good because the fear sets him up for more combos/skill chains.   Vision is an excellent counter: the physical immune passive makes Spidey useless, and Density Shift forces the AI to cancel their skill because diving into the ground makes him untargetable."
FutureFight,3cvc76,IrmaGoodness,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:42:53 2015 UTC,Ronan is excellent counter. He had natural crowd control stat on his gear so web wrap doesn't last long and his skills cause break. 4* or higher helps  Edit: Uni vision is also hilariously effective

FutureFight,3csco8,Woes_oh_noes,3,Fri Jul 10 17:34:35 2015 UTC,"Almost nobody has Red Hulk yet so you'll have to wait. Gamora is top-tier speed character, easily able to defeat her supposed counter trough mobility and death of a thousand cuts."
FutureFight,3csco8,UmYes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:59:37 2015 UTC,"The way I see it speed type heroes are not generally suited for VS, some exceptions aside. Do you use Gamora in VS? In case vs Who? Thank you"
FutureFight,3csco8,Woes_oh_noes,3,Fri Jul 10 21:12:51 2015 UTC,"She's very good against destroyer and probably ronan and bullseye too. Definitely not doc ock tho. Will just get killed by lasers because her skills have long cast times. 3rd skill is what makes her very good, although she's still decent at 2 stars. Speed heroes are generally very good in VS. Off the top of my head spidey, DD, BW, and green goblin are all very good."
FutureFight,3csco8,UmYes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:03:38 2015 UTC,"Lol I was thinking of the same lot but as exceptions. None of the VS bosses is a blast type so there are no type bonuses. A speed hero has to be good on his/her own.  I guess Gamora is good vs Destroyer because of her quickness but if she has long cast times I doubt she will do well vs Bullseye and his double moves...? Thank you anyway you gave me something good to ponder, I will think about it."
FutureFight,3csco8,Pika888,2,Fri Jul 10 22:12:12 2015 UTC,"Well, there's a lot of speed heroes that aren't very good, at least at 2-3 stars, but that's true for every type of hero.   The long cast times part only sucks because of the lasers. Against bullseye it doesn't matter that much because all of her skills cause flinch and it's pretty safe to get a combo off. So for instance you can wait until he's going to do the jump back triangle dagger throw move and while he's casting it you start your combo and it's completely safe. The slow bots would be a problem at later stages though."

FutureFight,3csco8,Toczen,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:18:59 2015 UTC,"I think last time I initially got a hero (don't remember if it was HB or Rocket) from daily check in, I somehow managed to get enough lucky drops to unlock them before the end of the event, so the last two days that I was supposed to get bios, I didn't get bios. But they had a second check in giveaway, and I got bios from that, so my best guess is that for someone who unlocks Red Hulk during the event, stops getting bios for that event.   So I'm really hoping I manage to unlock him before then (need two more Arena runs though, or a lucky flash sale), so that the check in would actually contribute to 3 starring him.

The only bad point about him was a mediocre leadership, but with Dodge Booster that ""bad"" leadership became incredibly useful. There's a reason Web resistant combat heroes or Web Resist Anti-Speed Ultron are a thing. He can solo Destroyer on Villain Siege, he can solo stages that lack Combat enemies.

Edit: I dont actually think Spedward hates spiderman. S/he just thinks there are other characters that will do better. So what? This game is all PVE anyways. Plus its his opinion. If you disagree say otherwise.    Also FutureFighters keep it civil out there!
FutureFight,3css20,Thesparkone,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:26:42 2015 UTC,"There was a previous thread showing a video about how one managed to beat a 6* High dodge gear Spiderman using Ultron with uniform while on Autoplay in Arena. The point was to show that he can be beat with Autoplay when the general consensus is that he can't and not many experimented on this since this is 6* characters we are talking about. Myself and Sped saw the point but got major downvoted. End result, Spidey fans defended and said that he wouldn't have been beat if Ultron took off the uniform which was beside the whole point since the general consensus is that 6* Spiderman ALREADY CAN'T be beat in Autoplay Arena."

You must be doing something wrong. Couple that with some really outlandish claims (Ghost Rider is better than spidey?) and you can't help but feel that he's trolling.  I appreciate his work maintaining this sub, but he really needs to take the advice some others have given him and tone it down a bit. Right now he just comes across as an ass."

To be clear my JI team is all going to reach Spidey at 5*, so I have not given up on them. They are just good enough but a bit squishy.  My Spidey sits at level 44, gear 10/11 and skill level 32, and whenever I take him out for a walk with Vision and Ronan (my top heroes) in stages 8-x , he invariably cannot take his round in the skill chain turnover without being seriously hurt. In  comparison Ronan is level 45, gear 9 and skill level 30."
FutureFight,3css20,EdgarDom81539,-7,Fri Jul 10 21:46:51 2015 UTC,Malekith has the best CC move in the game. Malekith is better immune to CC than Spider-Man. His attacks also hit a hell of a lot harder.  As for top speed character? Hell no. Gamora? Green Goblin? Elektra?

Malekith's CC resist is only vs slow (Teleport) unless you waste a leadership spot on him and even then is only 50% uptime.  I love Gamora and Goblin but Spidey's passive and team options still give him the edge imo."
FutureFight,3css20,Wizmaxman,-7,Fri Jul 10 14:47:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand Malekith's leadership skill (which is great). He has a 50% chance of removing it, yes, but as that negative affect ticks again, he has another 50% chance of removing it.  Spider-Man's passive is no greater than Green Goblin's.  Both Elektra and Spider-Man have 8 team bonus options. Just because of that, it doesn't make him the best speed character. Team bonuses are mostly useless imo... Strikers are much better."
FutureFight,3css20,IKADIXA,6,Fri Jul 10 14:54:56 2015 UTC,"No, it 100% removes it for 20 seconds but has a cool down where he is vulnerable. Plus he loses out on all the much better leaderships out there if you put him in that slot.  SM has Stun, Web, and Snare resist - all three big dogs of CC. Goblin has Snare resist. How on earth are those comparable?  And I won't even dignify ""team bonuses are mostly useless"" with a response."
FutureFight,3css20,Jellowpy,-6,Fri Jul 10 15:00:35 2015 UTC,"You obviously haven't used Malekith too much. He was my 8th character.  One character webs. Two characters stun.

FutureFight,3css20,Thesparkone,-4,Fri Jul 10 14:15:43 2015 UTC,I'd argue that Malekith's pull is the best as it leads up to arguably the strongest skill in the game.
FutureFight,3css20,-Harute-,7,Fri Jul 10 14:33:41 2015 UTC,ITT: People taking opinion as fact and bashing all who disagree.
FutureFight,3css20,Saberite913,6,Fri Jul 10 16:52:23 2015 UTC,"I would say spiderman is one of the best characters in the game. One of them, but not 1#. He used to be the best speed character, but has lost to gamora damage-wise in recent times (even green goblin is up there with his 50% poison gear). Spidey massively lacks defense and relies heavily on dodge. Thankfully, most of his skills are very safe. First, his web shot. It takes a super long wind up and only webs the opponent on the third shot, meaning any break skill in between will disrupt this completely. Without his webbing, spidey cannot execute his second skill (web swing kick) safely and to avoid damage, he either runs or uses his third skill (webslinger). While using webslinger, he is invincible mid-animation. His fourth skill(web fling) mini-stuns the opponent as it hits but doesnt break skill animations. His fifth skill, wrecking web, is a similar skill to his 2nd skill, except with an aoe and it hits like a truck. For the low defenses spidey has, he's compensated with dodge capabilities that can reach 70% when fully built and invested. Spidey also has stun, snare, and web resist, which further increases his survivability. He is only vulnerable to fear, which only a handful of characters have. The web resist special gear can be used to stop his web, but most people dont do that, as they'd be sacrificing their slot for a gear that will only be effective against 1 of spidey's skill and has no use at all against everyone else.  Spidey is good at the start-mid game due to his various team bonuses. He used to be just 'good' at 5 or 6 stars but has since become awesome in light of the existence of his 6th star skill. Enables him to cycle through skills, dealing huge amounts of damage before the opponent gets to react :)"
FutureFight,3css20,-Harute-,3,Sat Jul 11 12:26:12 2015 UTC,"I think Spidey is close to god tier.  But realistically, he doesn't compare to other similarly geared/leveled toons like Vision.  In the earlier stages, Spidey owned Vision, I'd say 3* and below, but once Vision got that 4th star, it was over, drastic drastic change.  Even into the 5th* it's still Vision all the way."
FutureFight,3css20,Goodsituation,5,Fri Jul 10 22:32:05 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go against the grain and say he's a good starter character but I have found I use him less and less as I get more characters leveled up.   He's not bad, but people make him out to be one of the best characters and I think he falls behind that in the later game.   Also as more people gear Web resist his best aspect is nullified.  Id rather spend resources on other characters now a days.   I think a  lot of the love of him comes from the JI package people got early on and it made him easy for new players to level up and get powerful."
FutureFight,3css20,SenpaiSpadesz,9,Fri Jul 10 14:57:10 2015 UTC,"If a character forces an entire batch of other characters to run gimmicks in order to counter him, that means he's top tier."

FutureFight,3css20,yoonjay,0,Fri Jul 10 20:14:01 2015 UTC,"That's why arena is not a good indicator on how good a hero is.   You could go and solo a team with spiderman and that player could then solo your team  with whomever.   My hulkbuster tends to just push spiderman over, while being immune to a lot of his damage.

Now we have 2 left Ant-man vs Goliath.  If you had these two characters Antman is . . . Kinda weakish but than when you compare him to Giantman. He does good by himself without a uniform so . . .   Personally I'd say go for Antman because at least it'll give him a boost.   Of course this is all my opinion haha comes down to your preferences   Extra little notes:  Giant mans default uniforms looks good already.  I could say the same about Antmans but I like both of the uniforms.  War Machine . . MURICA.

FutureFight,3csnck,tegeusCromis,3,Fri Jul 10 16:35:11 2015 UTC,It might be possible that it grants the bios depending on the hero's base rank. Since Angela starts at 3* you will always get 32 for her but Black Widow starts at 1 star so you will only get 8 for her. I'm not 100% sure since it's never happened to me :(.

FutureFight,3ct69e,not-kyle,4,Fri Jul 10 15:57:00 2015 UTC,I'm putting serious thought into just loading everyone up with ignore dodge. Even against enemies without the dodge gear I seem to see it happen pretty often. Especially running Hank as my main now I don't ever want to see one of his 2K 3rd skill or 5K 4th skill hits miss (dmg at level 40).
FutureFight,3ct69e,toysoldierxiii,3,Fri Jul 10 22:43:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought I read elsewhere that people are liking +dodge for characters with already high dodge, like Black Widow and Daredevil, and then Ignore Dodge for pretty much everyone else.  Oh and the elements for certain characters like Lightning for Nebula."
FutureFight,3ct69e,mainecoonmix,3,Fri Jul 10 23:08:08 2015 UTC,"Anything to mitigate RNG, especially now that Alliances will be granting every character +10% dodge here soon.  Perhaps not AS big of a priority for tiny dmg fast multi-hitters but any character with a nuke skill does not want it to miss."
FutureFight,3ct69e,toysoldierxiii,3,Fri Jul 10 23:18:52 2015 UTC,You will see I like critical damage and rate on list of those characters. I really only use Journalistic Integrity and Vision  • Capt. Marvel - critical damage/web/stun resist  • Venom - critical damage/rate  • Vision with Universal Uniform  • Ghost Rider - fire  • Black Bolt - electrical damage?  • Luke Cage - critical damage/rate  • Ultron with no uniform - critical damage/rate  • Spidey - dodge  • Ronan - dodge ignore or critical damage/rate  • Punisher - critical damages/rate  • Daredevil - dodge
FutureFight,3ct69e,Augmentedforth,4,Fri Jul 10 16:42:04 2015 UTC,"Don't put electrical on black Bolt, none of his attacks do electrical damage."

FutureFight,3ct69e,drakelb,2,Fri Jul 10 16:55:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with Augmentedforth, Crit Dam or rate are the best ones for most heroes unless the special gear is designed for that hero's skills (IE: Fire for Red Hulk or Ghostrider, Poison for Green Goblin), I'm thinking more will start to be released eventually, maybe ones that boost Defense, Def Penetration, etc"
FutureFight,3ct69e,talks-to-myself,3,Fri Jul 10 18:16:33 2015 UTC,how about dodge rate?
FutureFight,3ct69e,drakelb,2,Fri Jul 10 20:59:35 2015 UTC,I thought they had an increase dodge already?
FutureFight,3ct69e,talks-to-myself,3,Fri Jul 10 21:00:58 2015 UTC,I mean dodge is one of the better ones too right?
FutureFight,3ct69e,andaleo,3,Fri Jul 10 21:21:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is, imo. But only a few characters (like Spidey or DD) have a high enough inherent dodge to make it worthwhile. Otherwise you end up with ~25% dodge which is pretty high but in the end probably a waste. You're better off maximizing a certain characters trait."
FutureFight,3ct69e,tegeusCromis,3,Fri Jul 10 22:12:27 2015 UTC,Not sure about that. That dodge increase is still a way bigger boost to that character's effective HP than the crit rate gear is a boost to that character's average damage.
FutureFight,3cui0o,Jupiter354,4,Fri Jul 10 21:51:37 2015 UTC,"That happened to me with Vision, it's usually just a case of team bonus stats outweighing the actual base stats that will be increased via a rank up.  Just rank him up and all of his stats will increase, nothing to worry about"

FutureFight,3ct5rm,Hero_By_Proxy,3,Fri Jul 10 15:53:10 2015 UTC,I use crit rate on both because I don't find them taking damage very much. Iron Man is a fairly safe kiter and Gamora can chain multi-hit skills all day.
FutureFight,3ct5rm,tegeusCromis,2,Fri Jul 10 16:02:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks /u/tegeusCromis, precisely what I was thinking, just didn't feel confident in the choice. I appreciate the reassurance - i'll go crit."
FutureFight,3ct5rm,tegeusCromis,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:04:23 2015 UTC,"One thing I forgot: I'm wondering if dodge ignore might actually be the better choice. I'm not too sure what the dodge rate on higher level bosses is, but it might be high enough that dodge ignore would do more for DPS than crit rate would. Plus there's arena to think about."
FutureFight,3ct5rm,PolishTamales,3,Fri Jul 10 16:23:58 2015 UTC,"Critical Rate as the booster.  Critical Damage for custom gear.   Stark's Backing for ISO-8 for hit-n-run kiting.  Critical Damage requirement from raw numbers (ISO, custom gear sets) are half of the value for Critical Rate. In addition to that, Iron Man does not have natural Critical Damage default slots in his gear, so even if you do go with Critical Damage booster, the proc rate is so low it wouldn't out parse other builds.  Critical Hit Rate is more valuable on multi-hitting moves, such as Unibeam/Missile Barage, so looking at his strengths compared to War Machine, Iron Man is made for spacing and zoning enemies, rather than attempting to trade blows. Hence why Stark's Backing ISO-8 combo would benefit Iron Man with proper set-up.  You can check my gear-sets in game ala PolishTamales. I'm VIP lv.3, so don't expect any stats maxed out yet or a bazillion 6-Star characters, but it will give an idea where Iron Man is developing into."
FutureFight,3ct5rm,PolishTamales,2,Fri Jul 10 23:44:23 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you! Very kind of you to offer your ign - I like your train of thought here, I'll see if I can gamble my way to get Stark's Backing. Right now I'm on Unstoppable Madness.  Iron Man has been in every one of my squads however with the WM skin, I've kind of fallen in love with playing him. If I looked at your WM set-up, is that something you would suggest following as well?"
FutureFight,3ct5rm,Malthan01,3,Fri Jul 10 23:53:44 2015 UTC,"War Machine's ISO-8 combo for endgame is debatable compared to Iron Man.  War Machine's damage output is higher and faster compared to Iron Man by a large margin (hence why he's probably top 3 in MFF). He's currently my primary damage dealer if I need the muscle, but his final ISO-8 combo may not be Stark's Backing.   You may notice I have Critical Rate as his custom gear sets, but that may change to Critical Damage depending if I want to continue using him as muscle or another kiter like my Captain Marvel and Iron Man. It's a toss up until I can manage to get Binary on his ISO-8 and if I do, his custom gear sets will most likely revert to Critical Damage.  Although Spy Tactics does have Skill Cooldown time which makes his overall DPS insane."

FutureFight,3ct5rm,MegaMohsi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:04:13 2015 UTC,"This guy is on the right track, from what I've read generally the values on most critical related boosters aren't great, even with the synergy. I have about 14 5 stars and a couple of 6 and I've just decided to run dodge on all of them, possible dodge ignore on a few if stuns or breaks are important. By the end game missing a stun or dodging a Web shot can be very helpful, and with 35% more dodge I promise it will happen....VERY often. Especially in VS as they seem to have removed break from bosses vs 6 and up dodging their attacks is more important in the long run  Hope this helps"

It does massive aoe damage and most importantly it applies the shock debut in an aoe, which can constantly stagger your opponent just like her line lightning shot.  In short she was good before, this applies even more aoe clear to her already powerful move set. Only issue is that it forces her to close when her playstyle favors kiting, but so does systema which is overall a far weaker skill due to its lengthy cast time    *edit for readability"
FutureFight,3cu6cx,Malthan01,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:47:41 2015 UTC,"Its awesome :) the damage output is similar to his 2nd skill, but with an aoe range :D has an 11 second cooldown that doesnt matter since when u cycle through  your skills it chains nicely at the end. The skill breaks the opponent btw. In addition to having this skill, rank 6 also gives spidey lvl 50, a new iso slot so u can aim for the 8-slot isos. So, why not? :D"

FutureFight,3cssc1,Nelfrey,3,Fri Jul 10 14:07:25 2015 UTC,"Rulk will be a daily event soon plus he is tokenable, Ultron (and MODOK) still have their elites, and Wasp is tokenable.  That leaves Hank and YJ as the specials to decide between. Both are phenomenal and easily in the top tier of their class. Hank can give double drops in his so you would get him up faster but YJ has Ant-man and Wasp shifters, allowing you to basically farm 3 at a time.  If you have enough crystals I would recommend buying the Hank package (4 star plus uniform) and farming the YJ special."
FutureFight,3cssc1,toysoldierxiii,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:18:24 2015 UTC,"You can do what I do and farm for Yellowjacket and Giant-Man at the same time. Both missions are good leveling-up spots if you have a level 40/50 character since you get a guaranteed shifter (not guaranteed shifter bios, though) and that lets you run the missions in auto.  Run 5 for Yellowjacket, then do an unlimited run. That will allow you to get not only Yellowjacket bios, but also Ant-Man and Wasp bios.  Then run 5 for Hank Pym, then another unlimited run. Pym is also a shifter on his own mission so you'll get double bios most of the time.  Once you get all to 4* I guess you could focus on getting Pym to 6*"

FutureFight,3cqpma,driggs333,5,Fri Jul 10 00:35:59 2015 UTC,I have faith in NB. So far the way they've managed the game balance with the F2P model as well as churning out patches that addresses player's issues is better than most mobile games in the past few years. Which is why it will also mean that I will be on permanent Tony Stark's Cash subscription + whatever extra I will buy depending on limited offers.
FutureFight,3cqpma,Zephyraine,6,Fri Jul 10 01:00:57 2015 UTC,"I just hope they don't burn out. Actually, to be honest I'm feeling super spoiled for content right now. So much going on that I barely have the in-game energy for it. I love NetBarble (NB)."
FutureFight,3cqpma,IrmaGoodness,2,Fri Jul 10 01:53:23 2015 UTC,The Future Fight producer from NB at SDCC interview mentioned that there will be extra characters and storylines that will be coming even after this update and he seems committed to updating this game for quite some time.  Also: His favourite character from this game is WarMachine. Which is also my favourite. Hell Yea! XD
FutureFight,3cqpma,Zephyraine,3,Fri Jul 10 01:59:10 2015 UTC,"Haha I'm a little sad that you overlooked NetBarble. It should be NM :D But regarding what you said, I'm so glad to hear they plan to continue, and I really am super impressed with how great they're making the game. It's nowhere near the level of replayability and content I would have expected from a mobile game."
FutureFight,3cqpma,IrmaGoodness,4,Fri Jul 10 03:10:00 2015 UTC,"Haha, hmm I never realised it before. I have been using NB this whole time. Maybe it's because how random the game sounds when it starts up saying 'Net-Ma-bu!' I dunno, guess I'm weird."
FutureFight,3cqpma,Zephyraine,2,Fri Jul 10 03:51:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah after watching that interview  I have a feeling we'll be getting a few characters about every month or so and big updates to coincide with a movie.  Anyone who hasn't seen it they were both very stoked on, and repeated a few times, how they have lots of new characters coming. They seemed very enthusiastic about the game and at the end one of them said that they plan on supporting it forever."

FutureFight,3cqpma,ecwrocks,2,Fri Jul 10 00:46:02 2015 UTC,"Multiplay does sound awesome, especially now with alliances. But to be honest, they need to release more challanging stuff for that. People who started with the global release are now getting to the point now or soon(ish) where they can reliably complete VS every day, and there are no more content you would use multi play for (except for fun of course). It is a great addition for lower lvl players though.   I have faith in NM, they are doing a really good job with the game, but right now i think we do need more challanging content (maybe even events with a little competition) to keep the game alive for a long time."
FutureFight,3cqpma,primakov,2,Fri Jul 10 07:12:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, a lot of players who started early now play a game with VS called ""See if I can finish VS with half my roster unused"". These days, I can do it most times. We definitely need some harder content.  With that said, I am pretty sure that is what we will get when multiplay gets put in. No matter how much of a pain a stage 9 Doc Ock is, even new players could probably take him out 3 or even 2 vs  1. For one thing, he would near-constantly be locked down by skills.  I am guessing they will add some raid-style boss content with the multiplay, which will be excellent. If I am wrong, and I could be, it will be a bit disappointing; but real-time multiplay of any kind will be a fun addition."
FutureFight,3cqpma,chaoticheartld,2,Fri Jul 10 08:54:01 2015 UTC,I'd like to see 3 players running into each other trying to avoid the lasers. My money would definitely be on stage 9 Doc Ock vs. 3 new players.

FutureFight,3cqt7f,cannonmax,0,Fri Jul 10 15:15:39 2015 UTC,They're pushing out too much busy body content that are encouraging the  use of the cash shop rather than higher level content  and cap raises.
FutureFight,3cqt7f,HankPymWillHitYoGirl,6,Fri Jul 10 01:22:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with chaoticheartld the addition of real time multi play is hardly a cash shop grab.  To be fair out of all the characters in the game I think there are 3 (could be 4) that cannot be actively farmed and rely on shifter mode or bio purchase from store. That is an extremely good balance in my book. If you want a cash hungry game, go check out Contest of Credit Cards... Champions. You will be grateful that Future Fight is designed the way it is.  As for the higher level content, the game has been live for 2 months ? I am still new to the game, I am no where near pushing new further progressed content. Letting new players such as me, some slightly older players from launch etc all catch up to be the same level as beta players I think is a good move. Otherwise if real time pvp is coming you will have an unbalanced game play where beta players will always be lightyears ahead of others."

Sorry to say cr.4p happens and if a company wants to cash grab as much as possible over delivering an even balance, then it is their right. Im not naive, I know that as a company they have to strike a balance between;   Paying their employees Paying rents & rates for premises Paying for utility bills paying for equipment and software licenses Paying Marvel for the use of their brand Paying share holders and last but not least making a profit to show the company is growing. Giving you everything you want for nothing all the time will not help them achieve that balance.   This being said, if NM were to go down the same route as Kabam (who may aswell be in the process of applying to the courts to legally seize every players bank accounts and empty them) , then its clearly greed.  In its current form, NM have an excellent balance, paying players get an immediate slight advantage, but free players can catch up to this with a bit of work and grinding (I say a bit and not full time hours like most other games).  It is how games should be designed, without greed leading the way."

FutureFight,3cqt7f,MacStabby,8,Sat Jul 11 10:26:13 2015 UTC,"Don't know. They stated one of the things they are adding is real-time multiplay. That isn't really cash-shop content. In fact, it is one of the features a lot of people have REALLY been wanting. Plus, it opens up the way for interesting raid-style boss fights.  If they can do real-time multiplay, then there is also no reason we cannot eventually see an actual PVP mode, rather than just auto-battling dumb AI."

FutureFight,3cscqa,Lanceuppercut47,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:41:41 2015 UTC,"As Ronan already has a shield passive at rank 4, increasing his damage output was more my priority and I went with going for quicker specials, hence Angel of Death + SCD on gear (mine is only gear +10 so only had 4 blue slots on item 4 but going to prioritise getting that to +12 for the 5th)  The fear on Arbitration (more or less) adds 3 seconds of cooldown as the boss should be fear'd during that time so unable to respond etc.    Essentially I can almost safely rotate through Ronan's skills."
FutureFight,3cscqa,aLt23421,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:29:22 2015 UTC,So is possible to get certain type of skill on all gears?

FutureFight,3cscqa,Nelfrey,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:04:11 2015 UTC,"For Ronan, get anything that procs a shield. I use Bloodthirst on my Ronan and I frequently get back-to-back shield procs."
FutureFight,3cscqa,SuperShadowStar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:38:48 2015 UTC,I also use Bloodthirst. He's always leader and usually auto clears by himself or fights an entire arena team alone so the shield helps.
FutureFight,3crdsj,CountHalphas,4,Fri Jul 10 04:02:10 2015 UTC,"Angela does more damage, but is less safe. She requires superior timing and good awareness of when it is safe to jump in on a boss to attack. The reward for that awareness is she is a serious boss killer. Her stage clear is okay, but not amazing.  Destroyer doesn't do the damage Angela does (though his damage is decent, just not amazing like Angela's), but he is way safer to use. He clears well and does well against bosses. He is the safer, more well-rounded choice.  Which is better is really up to your personal taste and play-style."
FutureFight,3crdsj,chaoticheartld,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:28:45 2015 UTC,"Well I cannot answer all your questions as I do not have destroyer and my Angela is currently at 4*. But I will Answer what I can.   I do not have Destroyer so my bias will say Angela. Well she is all physical and her Angel's War Rage does crazy damage when it fully connects. Two of her moves breaks and she is my Boss killer on my team. I run her with Gamora. I normally go with Blades of Ichor, Angels's War Rage and then Sword Blow. It works well for me. This I cannot answer yet as I have not been focusing on gear but rather unlocking as many characters and building ranking my main team up. I guess the gear focus will come in due time.   With Ronan's leadership, your Angela will ascend to more than being an asgardian god."
FutureFight,3crdsj,Zullah,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:49:00 2015 UTC,"I have Destroyer at 4 stars, and Angela at 3, and I have to say, I like Destroyer more. Don't get me wrong, Angela is great too, but Destroyer's skill combo (Electromagnetic Wave->Crush->Disintegration Beam) is a thing of beauty as you can get away with 3 attacks without getting hit a single time if the stun on EM Wave connects. He's equally good against mobs and bosses, and is a real asset for me against Bullseye in Villain Siege. Plus, you can actually farm for his bios, however irregularly, unlike Angela for whom you have to pretty much depend on luck, flash sales and spending money."
FutureFight,3crdsj,TheRealSpidey,2,Fri Jul 10 05:10:08 2015 UTC,"The main difference here is that your Angela seems weaker cause she's one star lower than your Destroyer. At equal levels, stars and ranks angela has higher burst. But yes I agree Destroyer is better for mobs."
FutureFight,3crdsj,Nelfrey,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:31:37 2015 UTC,"No, I know better than to compare two heroes at different ranks :) I ranked up Destroyer just a few days ago, he was at 3 stars for me for a long time. I like Angela too, she might even be top-tier, but I just prefer Destroyer, especially for Siege (the best game mode to judge a character by, IMO)."
FutureFight,3crdsj,TheRealSpidey,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:03:39 2015 UTC,"Destroyer is slower and has a smaller burst but he is insanely more consistent. Angela is great on manual play though and is fantastic in both Arena and VS, though Destroyer also does well in those places. It really comes down to a playstyle choice."
FutureFight,3crdsj,SageofLogic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:23:48 2015 UTC,"I have a 4* Angela with the Dodge special gear and she is almost unkillable in Story Mode and Arenas.

FutureFight,3cr2g8,theKoal,2,Fri Jul 10 02:22:42 2015 UTC,"They are all strong but the only problem is that two of them are hard to find. If you have a crystal surplus and don't mind checking flash sales constantly, go for it"

FutureFight,3cr2g8,snowybell,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:35:35 2015 UTC,Yeah.. I'll just continue farming Ronan but focus on others until I get my blessed flash sales.
FutureFight,3cr2g8,TrackXII,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:42:03 2015 UTC,"I really like UVision and have been playing around with teams.  I liked the idea of Ronan's leadership and will probably use Captain Marvel as a third as they're the only thing I have at 3 stars right now.  Is Ultron a good choice for a third as I hear that team mentioned quite a bit?  I was also considering Thor as he was also universal but gives a cooldown reduction with his team-up with Vision, plus some crit.  Ultron is better for strikers though, isn't he?"
FutureFight,3cr2g8,coju3,2,Fri Jul 10 10:53:19 2015 UTC,"My first package I bought was Thorns of Thor because it had Malekith and Destroyer. I eventually gave up on Destroyer and ran Unite Under the Tree of Life. Once I got all those to 40 and was still at 3 stars, unable to finish either normal or elite, I started farming the easiest character to get bios for, the beloved M.O.D.O.K. I 5 starred him in like a week and he's actually pretty damn good. His leadership is 5% to energy attack per level, so he works really well with any of those characters. I use the Angel of Death iso set on him so his skill cooldown isn't too shabby. Also, check out his strikers.  TLDR; those are great characters to have, but be ready to grind the hell out of something more accessible if you want to get beyond normal 8-4 and elite 7-10 or so."

Malekith I found to work a lot better with Star-Lords Leadership, who I have at 5 star and is a beast when it comes to clearing crowds, or fighting multiple bosses (which is basically the last 2 chapters of the story. But hey honestly do what you want man, this game isn't as hardcore where investing in the heroes you like will cause you to suffer and be unable to enjoy yourself."

FutureFight,3cs02o,Saberite913,3,Fri Jul 10 08:22:20 2015 UTC,"Get all the FB-related achievements. If on iOs, you can use Gamecenter instead. Get top 1% in arena every week for 220 crystals. Do the daily achievements every day for 25 crystals."
FutureFight,3cs02o,tegeusCromis,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:33:48 2015 UTC,"This. If your aim is to get costumes, then it's not really difficult. One costume is 750 crystal and you can get it within 2 weeks just from daily and arena.  1 week : (25 * 7) + 220 = 395 crystals  Factor in your first clear mission rewards, daily login calendar rewards, FB/Gamecenter as well as those random GM gifts of 100 crystals each and you'll get there in no time."
FutureFight,3cs02o,Zephyraine,2,Fri Jul 10 08:53:34 2015 UTC,I can't really complete the daily achievements because of bonus missions. I only unlocked 3 for the time being and to get the achievement i need to complete 5.
FutureFight,3cs02o,Zephyraine,4,Fri Jul 10 09:02:26 2015 UTC,Then your priority is to focus on your main 3 characters to level them as high as possible for you to 3 star your Normal/Elite missions to unlock the bonus missions. Really your main aim is to get to Lv40 as fast as possible and then plow through everything else.

FutureFight,3cs02o,tegeusCromis,3,Fri Jul 10 11:45:15 2015 UTC,You don't have to switch anything. Gamecenter should connect automatically. Adding people on gamecenter will count as Facebook adds.

FutureFight,3cr1r6,Gpaint,3,Fri Jul 10 02:21:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with your assessment but would reach a different conclusion. There is not much point creating a merely decent character; the game is overflowing with those already. I'd rather make top-tier characters—the ones I'd willingly use—better.  Of course, if one just really likes Falcon, that's different."
FutureFight,3cr1r6,tegeusCromis,2,Fri Jul 10 15:02:59 2015 UTC,"1) Do you main any of the two characters?    Main 1 character: Get the costume for that character, because your crystals worth will be utilized if you use the costume often which translates to your main character. Main both characters: Well you're screwed. Just kidding, it'll come down to personal preference. You can either decide on visual appeal or functionality. If visual appeal then I can't advise you on that as that is your choice. If functionality, Iron Patriot makes the already awesome War machine into something even better but the Falcon costume gives 2 new skills to Falcon and makes him go from lower tier to decent level.    For me, I have enough crystals for both but I didnt buy Falcon simply because I will not use him in any of my teams as I don't feel like playing him. I only use him for VS for Boss fodder. It's down to preference to me."
FutureFight,3cr1r6,Zephyraine,2,Fri Jul 10 02:21:47 2015 UTC,"I have Iron Mania as my top team, so i'll get Patriot, I was just wondering if maybe Patriot wasn't actually that good and new Falcon was suddenly amazing or something.  Also a small part of me was/is hoping that since he changes the skills around, Falcon won't actually leave the shop."
FutureFight,3cr1r6,Zephyraine,3,Fri Jul 10 02:28:48 2015 UTC,"You're not really wrong. Costume wise, Patriot sucks compared to All New Captain America simply because all Patriot gives is an extra stun on a skill that already breaks opponents. All new Captain America gives two new skills with an attack buff that procs.  But the main difference in the end comes back to the character in itself. War Machine is god tier and Falcon isn't. Falcon with the new costume becomes MUCH better and goes from crap to decent. War Machine gets a mediocre improvement from God Tier to....God Tier."

FutureFight,3cr1r6,SageofLogic,3,Fri Jul 10 04:51:37 2015 UTC,I find that tier list kinda dodgy tbh. Even ignoring the changes since it was last updated I disagree in the realm of 5 points on some of the characters. Hulkbuster has a much higher score than it should for example.
FutureFight,3cr1r6,Zephyraine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:05:13 2015 UTC,You're probably right but I think it's more of nobody is giving consistent enough feedback to update the list. I gave my feedback on Groot about last week though.  Just need to lurk and ask around for info folks!

There literally are no bad points to him. Great damage, good breaks, lots of durability built into him and his gear, invincibility on skills, excellent leadership, good passive. Every part of him is good.  I am a bit hesitant to admit how strong he is, just because I don't really want him to become as popular as he deserves, but this forum has been great for sharing information, so no reason to stop now.  There will be people who don't like him or his playstyle, I am sure, but it won't be because he lacks strength. He has it in spades."

I am Really pleased with him. He has an amazing team bonus with Hulkbuster and Hulk, plus they all strike for each other. Since his skill attacks are all fire damage you can throw one of those fire boosters in his special gear slot. It is a great boost. He seems to be faster then Reg. Hulk but it might just be me.

FutureFight,3crrzt,SageofLogic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:28:34 2015 UTC,"Royal: I am not too sure about the reduction when near or applies to whole scenario, I do not have her third skill yet."
FutureFight,3crrzt,SageofLogic,2,Fri Jul 10 08:54:26 2015 UTC,I assume the skill works when she strikes for another active team member.
FutureFight,3crrzt,SageofLogic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:54:05 2015 UTC,As a striker? I would have to see the striker list associated with her.
FutureFight,3crrzt,rpmurray7,2,Fri Jul 10 08:57:19 2015 UTC,Switch to your other character after activating and blow through their skill chain quickly. I have the skill to where the skill cooldown value is 111 and I switched into Ronan with a skill cooldown set both ISO and Gear and I had noticeably lower downtime on my skills as they were going into cooldown. It was even a slight improvement on what he already had from his sets.
FutureFight,3conrs,IKabobI,7,Thu Jul 9 15:18:05 2015 UTC,"I mentioned a similar experience in another post. The game crashed or froze on me maybe 6 times since day one. Since patch 1.3, I'd say it freezes 3-4 times a day. It tends to be on loading screens for me. It has also really slowed down my iPhone 6. I tried to open the camera to get a picture of my dog acting like an idiot. Only, I had been playing FF at the time, and it probably took 30 seconds for the phone app to open. My dog was not willing to wait."

I just reinstalled the game because I checked the storage space it was taking up and apparently it was holding up about 5+ GB, which didn't feel right to me at all. After reinstallation it took up 1.1GB, and hasn't frozen or even lagged when multitasking since.  Definitely check how much space the game is taking up. If you're over 1.1GB, there's probably an issue with junk update files just clogging up your device. On iOS it's under Settings > Usage > Storage > Marvel Future Fight."

FutureFight,3cqb9w,Zephyraine,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:37:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if they worded the email wrong or that the entire game has been worded wrong the whole time. I thought it was pretty clear cut that the 3rd skill that is a Buff skill for some characters are self buffs. I can't imagine how something like Winter Soldier's Super Armor can apply to the whole team when it's clearly a self buff skill. Doesn't make sense at all.  Honestly, just leave buffs in the characters. Netmarble will provide and alternative fix by letting the 6* characters of those characters have another attack skill eventually."
FutureFight,3cqb9w,BossBattleE,4,Fri Jul 10 00:19:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think they meant it like that. I think I was more that a teams leadership is applied before their self buff is applied so it adds to it.  For instance a hero with a leadership that increases defense, when Cap uses his, it's better because of the leadership."
FutureFight,3cqb9w,Zephyraine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:51:45 2015 UTC,"Right, I conveniently missed out on OP's original email at the bottom of the picture which was pretty clear.

FutureFight,3cqu6j,Kureguu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:49:13 2015 UTC,"Well the Ant-man's chapter of special missions are a lot easier than GotG's, which is probably why they reduced drop rates."

FutureFight,3crenn,Death_Keeper,2,Fri Jul 10 04:10:01 2015 UTC,"It's not a problem. There's a thread on this already. It's officially confirmed that while you get 100% Ally Shifter rate in Special Missions, the Biometrics drop rate is NOT 100%. This is why Shifters in special Missions do not contribute to the Daily Shifter Limit as well as mentioned in the patch notes.  This rule does not apply to Shifters in Normal/Elite missions."
FutureFight,3crenn,Zephyraine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:49:24 2015 UTC,Which missions get a 100% shifter appearance rate?
FutureFight,3crenn,Lanceuppercut47,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:13:48 2015 UTC,I can't speak for the rest as I have been on The Yellow Jacket bandwagon since the patch day. But Yellow Jacket Special Missions have 100% shifter rate of either Ant man or Wasp. I think Giant Man stage have 100% shifter rate as well but I can't remember who was it.
FutureFight,3crenn,Zephyraine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:20:48 2015 UTC,"It's Giant Man himself which means you can get double bios for hi, on that stage. :)"
FutureFight,3crenn,Bravd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:50:38 2015 UTC,From what I know shifters always come out in those specials but their drop rate isn't 100% not sure if the drop rate is dependant upon which level you run but having the chance of an extra bio drop every run isn't so bad
FutureFight,3cpuvs,linktm,5,Thu Jul 9 20:32:51 2015 UTC,"Eventually, once you can consistently clear stage four (some people are satisfied with three) you can grind them for both solid amounts of XP and fast character ranking."
FutureFight,3cpuvs,rhysappa12,3,Thu Jul 9 20:38:33 2015 UTC,"Regarding the question, most of the special stages (except stupid MODOK) are the only way to get certain characters, and fast."
FutureFight,3cpuvs,rhysappa12,3,Thu Jul 9 20:39:54 2015 UTC,"What these people have said pretty much. It is the best way to farm biometrics period, but its only for those selected characters. Luckily most of them are pretty good (ignore yondu and drax).  It is also where i do my xp grinding. stage 4 is pretty much the standard place for you to take a good lvl 40 clearer (vision, ronan, etc... just strong aoe skill chars) and power level two other characters.  before that a good level 30 can power level chars at stage 3 without a significant drop off in biometric drops.    The answer is its a place to grind xp and get biometrics for specific characters"
FutureFight,3cpuvs,TheDessertFoxx,2,Thu Jul 9 22:12:59 2015 UTC,"Yondu has been fixed, though he isn't really a boss fighter more a stage clearer, and Drax gets a lot batter once he hits 4 or 5*. He has some solid team ups too."
FutureFight,3cpuvs,SageofLogic,3,Thu Jul 9 22:26:54 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ, Yondu is a Boss Killer in my opinion. His Arrow Call + INSANELY fast normal attack allows him to kite bosses easily. Arrow Call does HUGE burst damage at just Lv20 skill level. My lv35 Yondu gear+9, no mastery, no ISO can easily do 4k Normal damage using Arrow Call and higher when fighting Blast types."
FutureFight,3cpuvs,Zephyraine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:24:25 2015 UTC,Oh cool so once he gets over a hump he can pull that off that's exciting. I just know his 3* arrow skill is just about useless on them.
FutureFight,3cpuvs,SageofLogic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:28:19 2015 UTC,"He doesn't need to be 3* to be good. Arrow Call is one of his first 2 skills and both skills are single target skills. His 3rd skill is his AoE attack which is similar to Cap America's Shield Throw: decent when in mobs, crap against Bosses."
FutureFight,3cpuvs,Zephyraine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:31:26 2015 UTC,It also has a pretty long pre-launch animation which shocked me.
FutureFight,3cpuvs,SageofLogic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:36:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, which is why I tend to just forget about using it and just use him against bosses."
FutureFight,3cpuvs,Zephyraine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:42:41 2015 UTC,Unfortunately he is like 4th on my priority list for GotG special missions. So I'll likely never get him to 4 unless he has a 100x flash sale. I want to get Drax and Nebula to 5* because I don't have many high ranked combat/physical characters to use on Destroyer VS.
FutureFight,3cpuvs,SageofLogic,2,Fri Jul 10 00:52:35 2015 UTC,"If its against Destroyer you will have many options I think. Yondu, Drax, Nebula, and especially Gamora can do well against him. Of course, Yondu is handicapped with the single useless AoE skill. I usually use Spiderman against Destroyer though. Simply because he has ISO sets as well and can DPS pretty well against him."
FutureFight,3cpuvs,Zephyraine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:58:53 2015 UTC,"He is useable even at 1*, so I'd take a short detour to unlock him for VS."

FutureFight,3cpuvs,SageofLogic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:58:09 2015 UTC,Drax's style is a bit too similar to kingpin but with slower break abilities for me. I just stick with KP and my other combats. Yondu i would revisit but this game is just rife with good speed characters that i want to play more.
FutureFight,3cpuvs,TheDessertFoxx,2,Sun Jul 12 17:47:09 2015 UTC,"Well, you asked two questions. The answer to the first is yes, it's better to farm specials only after you can run at least stage 3 and preferably stage 4.  The answer to the second is they're just the method NM has chosen for unlocking certain characters, instead of the elite route. They aren't ""limited availability"", just different availability. (In fact, they are more accessible than elite bios once you are able to run the stage 3+ versions.) Oh, and high level specials are great for power levelling new characters, too."
FutureFight,3cpuvs,tegeusCromis,2,Thu Jul 9 20:40:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, these special events aren't going away then? I was under the impression, based off the chest sale in the shop, that the maps would eventually vanish? Been playing too many F2P games and figured this was similar to stuff like in Avengers Alliance or FF Record Keeper."
FutureFight,3cpuvs,Kureguu,4,Thu Jul 9 20:45:05 2015 UTC,"It would be very difficult for them to displace the characters you get from special missions to something else. GotG chapter gives 5 unique characters, while Ant-man chapter gives 4 unique characters. It would be a huge paywall if they decide to remove them"
FutureFight,3cpuvs,tegeusCromis,2,Fri Jul 10 01:51:43 2015 UTC,"NM has not specifically promised that the specials will always be here, but they also have not stated that the specials are for a limited time. The chests are, but that's a separate matter.  Judging by how NM approached the Ant-Man rollout (adding the new missions while keeping the GotG missions), it seems a safe bet that the specials are permanent. Or at least will stay for the immediate future."
FutureFight,3cpuvs,RnzDryll,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:10:00 2015 UTC,"well, i suggest that you focus first on your main team before focusing on special stages just as egeusCromis said it is just to farm bios and unlocking characters other than elite with limited availability limit"

FutureFight,3cr4vb,SageofLogic,2,Fri Jul 10 03:14:01 2015 UTC,"No they don't. It's mentioned in the patch notes.  EDIT: To the downvoter, what part of my statement is wrong? Just go and look at the patch notes located in the Mobirum forums. They even conveniently highlighted that statement that it doesn't count towards your daily limit. Unless your colour blind, I think it is pretty clear."
FutureFight,3cqvtr,nvmidied,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:25:14 2015 UTC,I've wondered that myself. It usually seems as if the drops are better with tickets though I get my fair share of zero bio runs that way too. I have not made a list to compare them but I wonder if our perception gets skewed because we just knocked out several missions instantly where it's easy to measure the results. Running each one on auto takes  much more time so the total rewards are spread over time seemingly worse overall. Then you add in RNG and well it's probably all business as usual
FutureFight,3cqvtr,Gpaint,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:58:52 2015 UTC,"i've had 0 drops in 6 tries for Vision when i use clear tickets, i guess it's just really RnG."

Clear Tickets with 0/6 countless times in a span of a few days. Just tried it today and I got a 4/9 for War Machine, which was like the best I've had this week -.- (0/3, 1/3, 2/3). There's still a 0/3 in there though.  I can't really use my phone while I'm at work so I have to use Clear tickets for my bios just to use up the energy.

FutureFight,3cqvax,I_Am_Iron_Man_AMA,4,Fri Jul 10 01:21:06 2015 UTC,"War Machine I believe has the ""strong"" character trait which means his basics do more damage. Vision's strength is a lot in his 3* skill and his passive he gets at 4. Vision's skills all move him in fairly predictable ways so you can move him out of danger and do damage at the same time, especially with that 3. His passive triggering basically gives you carte-blanc to go to town on any physical damaging enemy as well."
FutureFight,3cqvax,SageofLogic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:08:09 2015 UTC,"So the ""traits"" on the detail page affect their abilities in combat? Is there a list of what does what?"
FutureFight,3cqvax,SageofLogic,2,Fri Jul 10 02:28:43 2015 UTC,There's a thread somewhere with what people have found out through experiments.
FutureFight,3cqvax,Zephyraine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:42:54 2015 UTC,"This. Vision's basic attack will be less than Iron patriot and that is normal. But Density Shift outshines Iron Patriot's skills simply because of the damage output as well as invulnerability. Combine that with Physical Immunity at 4*, and Vision's lower defense wouldn't really matter at all cause he won't even get damaged. Don't forget you can put bloodthirst ISO set bonus on Vision for that extra shield. I think the rest is self explanatory."
FutureFight,3cqvax,-Harute-,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:29:03 2015 UTC,War Machine has Explosion and Flight for his abilities.

FutureFight,3cqvax,Gpaint,2,Fri Jul 10 14:19:45 2015 UTC,The top tier part is (imo) more due to the immunity/target loss his skill density shift does in addition to his damage which is also quite good. That and his phys immunity shield and fast movement around the playing field all add to the top tier part.   I think 4* is when I really felt Vision was worth every effort I put into him. He's 5* now and his damage is very good

FutureFight,3cpp0a,msde,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:19:10 2015 UTC,When I had a bunch of extra money from the +gold event I started combining the rainbow ones since you never get more than a 2* version of them as drops from the dailies.

It absolutely wrecks, sooooo much damage.  Also, if you do all his 3 skills in a row, it actually can take down a boss on his level to about 10% (i have him at 31), and because he shrinks and stuff he barely takes damage. Haven't been able to figure out if his skills break yet, but he is very very powerful."
FutureFight,3cpgsq,Angelshover,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:52:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Giant man's stage makes it very easy for AoE to hit. And using a cc-heavy hero, you can lock Loki down entirely at one corner of the stage until he die. Use Ronan and you will know what I mean. I usually finish lv40 specials at 1.40-1.50, but I can run through the Giant Man one in 1.00-1.10 with autoplay by just using Ronan and 2 low level heroes. Also, the Giantman shifters make it even more rewarding.  Yellowjacket does look much cooler, and very powerful as well. I think he might be a top-tier hero. That being said, Giantman is also really good. The two also makes excellent combo team with Antman.   What I suggest to OP is this: get Yellowjacket to 4* first. It will really help you in Villain Siege so you can farm chaos tokens more easily. Then you start farming Giantman."
FutureFight,3cpgsq,Angelshover,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:17:18 2015 UTC,"Depends. If you want to focus on one person, then Giant-Man. If not, then go with Yellowjacket since you can also get Wasp and Ant-Man bios."
FutureFight,3cpgsq,Angelshover,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:39:25 2015 UTC,"I'm farming Yellowjacket to 5* first. The main reason is Villain Siege. I already clear it fully, but having another blast hero will make it so much easier. I'm using War Machine to clear who easily solos both 4 and 5 so I'm leveling up Ant-Man update characters in the other two slots."
FutureFight,3cpgsq,Angelshover,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:41:51 2015 UTC,"I'm going to farm both to 3* first, then try them out a bit more before deciding who to focus on getting to 4* first :)"

FutureFight,3cq8jk,Tattoomyvagina,6,Thu Jul 9 22:14:56 2015 UTC,Yellow jacket is a blast type so he has an advantage over Cap. Furthermore he is a 3 star which gives him a 3rd skill to use. Same thing happened to me i got thrashed by Angela when first started playing arena seeing her low level and all. The third star makes a world of difference.

Ant Man is pretty good but there's better speed characters out there.  I'd say go with Giant Man if you're just going to get one as he's easiest to farm and just get Ant Man passively through farming shifters but if you're willing to drop crystals then you could go with the pack and get him 4 star out of the box. His uniform combined with his passive greatly improves him plus he's pretty fun to play with."
FutureFight,3cpcnn,driggs333,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:26:22 2015 UTC,I agree. They both have great skills but Giant Man fills a balanced and consistent combat character slot that was badly needed.

That way you won't used up your shifter count.  edit: drop rate for ally shifter in special is also rng i think. it's somehow a bit different for special i.e. ally shifter in special means 50/50 you get shifter bio while ally shifter in normal/elite 100% obtainable. correct me if i'm wrong

Since you're just starting go for the ones you like the most, and give the others a try you may end up liking them better than you were expecting. I would say try going as far as you can on those since Normal missions give you the farmable items you will later need to upgrade gears on your heroes, and Elites can provide you with a good source of Bios. Wait for a flash sale that entices you, those seem to be the best investment when limited on crystals. I would say to avoid upgrading your skills to levels higher than 20, try to focus on balancing your heroes, but you'll start to get a feel for everything in no time. Just like Spedwards said, keep 2 of your characters pretty leveled up so that they can carry whichever other character you want to boost up.

I think what's likely to happen is this: you'll focus on one team, max their levels, and then get stuck because it takes a little (a lot) longer to get enough bios to rank them up so you can push on further. This means your ongoing goals will be not only to strengthen your core team and advance, but also to make the most of your other opportunities: villain siege and arena (which aren't open immediately, but which you'll unlock as you advance). The first requires you to strengthen secondary and tertiary heroes which you might not usually use in story mode. But I guess this is ground covered by qn 6. Save them until you're sure you know what to spend them on. I mean, the general answer is ""bios"", but bios for which hero? We can't answer that question for you. Sole exception: definitely grab Malekith bios (x 40 or more) on flash sale. Make sure you do as many of the achievements as you can. Max 3. Then use one maxed hero to carry two weak heroes through levels so they can level up quickly. It's explained in the lab tutorial, isn't it?"
FutureFight,3coz65,tegeusCromis,2,Thu Jul 9 17:23:02 2015 UTC,Device issue Up to you Sure! Why not? Flash Sales / Energy Not really. Anything important is kind of obvious. Max at least 2 characters before levelling everyone else. Science magic.
FutureFight,3coz65,Spedwards,2,Thu Jul 9 16:52:53 2015 UTC,"Flash Sales / Energy   For a new player, just flash sales, IMO. Energy is really expensive if you're buying it off the flash sales or the 150 energy item in store. Better to wait till one's SHIELD level is healthy, then go for 100 crystal full refills."

FutureFight,3coz65,tegeusCromis,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:10:08 2015 UTC,"been on and off for me. well vision should be the first character you focus on getting.  after that its personal preference. getting your butt kicked by some characters in arena will give you a good idea of who you want to use. First goal should be to clear elite as far as you can (or at least to the characters you want to farm bios for).  In many ways, bio farming IS this game. Save them as much as possible. dont spend them on any boxes. use them rarely on energy recharges.  The sales and packages are the things to spend them on. use xp chips exclusively on characters below level 20 until your whole crew is level 20.  use them on characters with bonus exp first.  Itll maximize their effect.  Generally farm weapon upgrade materials before armor.  Get all your gear to lvl 3/6/9 where you can as that is where they gain new stats.  6 is the most important lvl because that is where they get their permanent stats.  I would max 3 characters first for your arena team. After that make them a permanent team on your list and then have one of them power level your other chars.  The lab is new and i wish i had detailed info for you but it just kind of seems like a ""check in and get stuff"" place added to the game. the lab shop is intriguing though.  you can get mats for very cheap, but i would not spend any crystals there."

FutureFight,3cpo4q,-Harute-,2,Thu Jul 9 20:10:06 2015 UTC,"Doesn't even have to be all attack for any character. All characters only need Physical or Energy attack, even if they have a move with a different type of damage, the actual damage comes from their primary attack stat."

FutureFight,3cpo4q,-Harute-,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:15:40 2015 UTC,"If on a main character, yes. Depending on the value you get (around 160-200% I think) the character should be at least level 35 to close the gap between HP% and HP+ or go over."
FutureFight,3cpo4q,bobsponge933,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:04:45 2015 UTC,I'm still confused....
FutureFight,3cpo4q,-Harute-,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:47:34 2015 UTC,Just don't worry about it unless using it for your main characters that you know you're gonna level up rto the Max :).
FutureFight,3cpo4q,theorycl,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:45:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed with general consensus--%HP only for first option.  But I do have to add--%HP is only better than flat HP once your character is at least level 40 or close to it   Example: Level 40 with option HP by Lv %180 (let's use the average for argument's sake). This gives you 72 HP. A level 30 character with the same option would get 54 HP.   So for my less focused and weaker characters, I have flat HP all around for them, which is around 60-65 HP. Changing the first option is 1k gold per reroll, so not a big deal if you're into min/maxing"
FutureFight,3cpo4q,tegeusCromis,2,Thu Jul 9 20:24:13 2015 UTC,"Thing is, if you're not focusing on them, why even bother rerolling for a few points more HP or attack? It's hardly ever going to make a difference in VS, which is the only point of such characters. I also figure I'll eventually level the throwaways, in which case keeping the % now is going to save me gold later."
FutureFight,3cpo4q,theorycl,2,Thu Jul 9 20:35:36 2015 UTC,"Just being thorough with the info so OP can make a decision.  Generally, if I get a flat HP option for a lower level character, I'll just stop rerolling, and consider changing it later. Mainly just for people who have no issues with gold and like twinking characters."
FutureFight,3coryu,snowybell,3,Thu Jul 9 15:49:13 2015 UTC,"Cap Marvel has long been outclassed by other heroes. She is mediocre at boss-killing and no better at crowd clearing than, say, Ultron. Gamora is a much better choice. She has safe combos and great damage.  Source: have 5-starred and used both of them."
FutureFight,3coryu,tegeusCromis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:11:58 2015 UTC,Gamora is a MONSTER. At 32 she was killing a level 40 Destroyer in like 45 seconds. I can't wait to see what she is at 5* Level 50.
FutureFight,3coryu,palmermarc,2,Thu Jul 9 19:03:55 2015 UTC,"Gotta be 6* to hit lvl 50. But yeah, she's amazing. You can throw her at any non-Ock boss at VS 9 and call it done. Probably finish near full health, too."
FutureFight,3coryu,tegeusCromis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:15:14 2015 UTC,Ohh well.. That girl is a beast. lol
FutureFight,3coryu,palmermarc,2,Thu Jul 9 19:17:54 2015 UTC,"Yep Gamora is crazy good.   Her cooldowns are relatively quick too, so most of the time I can do a chain of 6-7 skill attacks before having to run away. No extra skill cooldown options either. Her bleed passive is just icing on the cake.  My 5-Star Level 40 Gamora can usually solo the last boss of VS--always Destroyer, and sometimes Ronan if I play more carefully. I haven't tried against Doc Ock or Bullseye yet b/c of the class disadvantage."
FutureFight,3coryu,theorycl,3,Thu Jul 9 20:31:18 2015 UTC,I like Gamora more than Capt. Marvel. All of her skills break and 2 of them have built in dodges.  Capt. Marvel falls off hard. I also have a 4* Capt. M on a Ronan team and she doesn't feel like she compares to Ronan/Angela/Ultron.   I want to get her to 5 just because I've invested so much into her already but Gamora is definitely better.
FutureFight,3coryu,Eselgee,3,Thu Jul 9 16:14:32 2015 UTC,"Well it depends. I recently started the game about a month or so ago and Cpt. Marvel was the first target for me to get. I started buying her bios after every Arena battle. Then Gamora was put in there. Got both Gamora and Angela from Flash sales  and the 10x bios to unlock Cpt Marvel. I currently run that team with three of them and I will tell you this, if you have no plans of Gamora, get Cpt Marvel. But from personal game play, Gamora is a beast. I use Cpt Marvel to clear levels and Angela and Gamora to make bosses kiss their heels and backside.   There will be no regrets in getting Gamora but if JI team is you second, then Cpt Marvel. How about this, unlock Gamora to 3 stars and then after that it will be an easy decision to see if you prefer Cpt Marvel or Gamora. I think this is the better was to go."
FutureFight,3coryu,Zullah,2,Thu Jul 9 17:27:12 2015 UTC,I've got my CM halfway to rank 5 but have very little drive to keep ranking her up.  She's not weak by any means and JI is still a pretty good team but my 5* Vision solos most 4-5* JI teams with ease on Autoplay.   She's a good character that when most people had 3-4* teams was dominant but can't keep up with others at ranks 5-6.

So the consensus is that Gamora is definitely better than Capt Marvel? I have Angela too, i was thinking of making a team with Angela and Gamora, who would the leader be?"
FutureFight,3coryu,lnfidelity,2,Thu Jul 9 16:18:45 2015 UTC,It's not a waste because she'll help you for Villain Siege. She is still one of my strongest members for VS just because of her leadership.
FutureFight,3coryu,Zullah,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:36:32 2015 UTC,"I currently run Angela, Gamora and Cpt Marvel with Angela as the leader. Cpt Marvel clears out mobs, hits the boss and clears out the minions that spawn after the first boss hit. From there it is pure hell and mayhem for the boss as it just becomes an Angela and Gamora boss slicing fest. They are my boss killers as Cpt Marvel is the minion clearer."
FutureFight,3coryu,tegeusCromis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:29:48 2015 UTC,"What rank is your Gamora? I think at 5*, she doesn't need anyone else to clear minions for her."

Building up crystals to take advantage of that from flash sales.  Also I believe that at 5* like you said, she will need no one as her power levels at 3* makes me shiver at the thought of what it will be at 4* talkless of 5*"
FutureFight,3coryu,tegeusCromis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:35:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she is an unstoppable force at 5*. At that point (or maybe even now) I would suggest swapping out Cap Marvel for someone like WM, whose leadership will give both Gamora and Angela a massive boost."

Until then, put a defensive ISO set on her and she's fine."
FutureFight,3coryu,msde,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:01:38 2015 UTC,"I probably will if nothing else turns up and I save up enough to go from 4* to 6* all in one go.  I'm farming Ronan and UVision for a universal team, and any strong universal character will do fine in the third slot.  I already have Captain Marvel 4/4 with high skills and level 12 gear across the board.  My Ultron is weak (3/1 with sub-9 gear) and as far as I'm concerned isn't worth the massive investment to make better than my Captain Marvel.  Ultron is already the 3rd member of the team, so I expect him to be obsolete in a few more versions.  UVision will be great for a long time, because he upgrades with blast gear and has a uniform.  Once I 6* Ronan I'll probably be running the last ant-man special though, so we'll see what happens."

FutureFight,3cpb4z,nysteryan,2,Thu Jul 9 18:05:54 2015 UTC,"Of course. You're pretty close. Even without a new skill (at the moment), stat and level cap boost is a big deal."
FutureFight,3cpb4z,tegeusCromis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:13:46 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Just finished 6* Ronan and he's an absolute monster
FutureFight,3cpb4z,dann511,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:21:58 2015 UTC,"Good to hear. I finally cracked and bought crystals just to catch a sale for him, so it'd better be worth it. It wasn't much, but I'll take nearly any bios for him I can get.   Is it true that at 4* he can basically solo his own Special-4?"
FutureFight,3cpb4z,CoherentInsanity,2,Fri Jul 10 00:49:52 2015 UTC,Yes but you have to babysit at 4*/4*.  I took my Ronan leadership bonus and ran with 4*/4* UVision instead until I hit 5*.  4* UVision with 3* Ronan leadership just needs to be placed to ensure chest destruction and avoidance of the stupid slow bubbles.
FutureFight,3cpb4z,msde,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:07:43 2015 UTC,Hoping to finish mine today.  Just 16 bios left.

FutureFight,3co0vt,Karzak85,5,Thu Jul 9 12:01:36 2015 UTC,"I think its more than one factor here. The game is designed such that you need to farm for stuff and with the recent update, they added more Gold Sinks in the form of Shield Lab so its not surprising that you would have less gold for you to play around. That said, perhaps you are indeed focusing on too many heroes at once. Just try upgrading skills from say Lv 30-35 for one team and see how much that costs. Not saying you can't focus on many heroes at once, it's just the way the game is designed to be: Not to play all day long and get everything maxed out in one play. Its meant for consecutive plays with breaks in between, which I am aware is off-putting for some players since they want to treat this game like a full fledged game where you can play for marathon-like sessions."
FutureFight,3co0vt,Zephyraine,3,Thu Jul 9 11:58:28 2015 UTC,"I sympathise with your gold woes (though I agree with u/Zephyraine that you may be spending too much on skills).

FutureFight,3cnzmr,darxide23,3,Thu Jul 9 15:48:37 2015 UTC,"Spend several thousand dollars on crystals.  To be exact, you need to buy 276,400 crystals to get VIP 13. With a the buy one get one crystal sale going on right now, you would have to buy 25 $100 crystal packs plus a little bit extra. So 26 packs to reach VIP 13 which simple maths says is $2600. Without the buy one get one sale, double that."
FutureFight,3cnzmr,hohndo,2,Thu Jul 9 17:40:29 2015 UTC,The bonus and BOGO crystal don't count towards the total. Only the ones you paid for.

FutureFight,3cng7g,chaoticheartld,3,Thu Jul 9 10:21:02 2015 UTC,Giant-Man because having a character that goes giant makes for striking visuals! Not to mention he's the best at buffing himself for extra damage and bulkiness.

I'm someone who isn't familiar with Antman's universe so Yellow Jacket's Visual design was the most striking and appealing to me. I mean he pretty much looks like a Power Ranger with mechanical arms. And this is without factoring his gameplay even...

He was definitely the sub of the two.  And even the writer said it was a miscommunication between him and the artist, he wasn't meant to intentionally strike her. But even with the artist's take dude was in the middle of a breakdown at the time.  Honestly he is probably the LEAST abusive spouse in all comics, dude was never anything but caring."
FutureFight,3cng7g,lnfidelity,3,Thu Jul 9 15:00:06 2015 UTC,"Well, I wouldn't say that he's the least abusive, because he has hit her in some scenarios that just didn't make sense.

Hank suffers from several mental deficiencies including bipolarity and multiple personality disorder. He has a low self-esteem, and it doesn't help that his wife at several times in their marriage is neither supportive nor understanding of his dilemma. When the two of them are great, they're awesome--when they're not, he loses it. Janet is not innocent either, she is very egotistical and is spoiled, which is why she constantly adds to his self-esteem issues, where he doesn't feel adequate for her.  The physical abuse that he's so infamous for has been blown way out of scale when plenty of other characters (namely: Mr. Fantastic, the father of the first and most iconic family) are even more notorious for abusing their spouses.  I would have preferred that they didn't avoid it, because Hank and Janet's relationship is real, is loving even if there are moments of instability. Instead, we get the horrible story of Scott Lang, who is as generic and bland as they come."
FutureFight,3cng7g,SageofLogic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:44:03 2015 UTC,I don't like Mr. Fantastic either. And to be fair even after Janet he continues to be emotionally abusive/creepy of his future partners like Jocasta and Tigra. But I agree about Scott being bland. Only good thing he ever did was give us Cassie who I enjoyed as a character.

FutureFight,3cng7g,SageofLogic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:58:39 2015 UTC,Just the abusive ones. Also Hank Pym's mental health issues were retconned in long after he was shown to be physically abusive. The argument you should have made was this trend for both him and Mr. Fantastic started when it was more socially acceptable for men to treat their wives that way. I still wouldn't like that argument but it would have been a better one.
FutureFight,3cng7g,lnfidelity,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:00:37 2015 UTC,"I thought they just retconned him being a Skrull, and that they were all of his own mental deficiency?

FutureFight,3cmamp,CountHalphas,5,Thu Jul 9 01:00:15 2015 UTC,"It is still a bit early to tell, but if I had to place a wager, it would be on Yellowjacket being God Tier; like equal or better than Vision God Tier. I could be wrong, but there are good signs pointing to him being that strong.   He gets a skill with invincibility frames that also does pretty good damage, and his ""Stinger"" skill may just end up taking the crown for highest damaging skill next to Aether Bolt.   He gets native HP and Dodge on his gear, and has a pretty useful passive. Add in his excellent leadership, and he is almost a cinch for God Tier.   His base stats are pretty low (about 1k less Energy Attack than most blasters, but 800 more HP), but so are War Machine's. All together, Yellowjacket has a LOT going for him.  As to whether to finish off Ronan or not, Ronan get some significant improvement each time you rank him up; especially the 5 star. It is worth getting him to 5 star eventually for sure; and considering he is so close, you might as well finish him off first. Get Yellowjacket, put him in your Ronan farm team, and level him up. By time you are done getting Ronan to 5 stars, he will be lvl 40 and ready for you to rank up next."
FutureFight,3cmamp,CountHalphas,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:03:37 2015 UTC,Well said. This is an excellent summary of how I feel about him after playing with him awhile. His kit is very good!

FutureFight,3cmamp,bluebreeze_will,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:46:55 2015 UTC,what does his leadership do?
FutureFight,3cmamp,Jplato09,2,Thu Jul 9 05:28:47 2015 UTC,"If you mean Yellowjacket, it gives everyone in the team a 5% chance on hit to Paralyze (basically stun) the target. It has an initial 20 second cooldown, but each rank of the Leadership lowers that cooldown by 2 seconds, so eventually you can have everyone on the team stunning on hit once every 10 seconds. Considering the cooldown is separate for each team member, you can potentially keep someone locked down with Paralysis for 6 out of every 10 seconds."
FutureFight,3cmamp,bluebreeze_will,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:38:52 2015 UTC,It increases 6% att and defence each mastery lvl for universal heroes
FutureFight,3cmamp,Gpaint,3,Thu Jul 9 05:33:47 2015 UTC,"Like what the other said you should concentrate on Ronan first, his 4th skill is quite good and once you get him to ★★★★★ he can basically solo his special mission 4. Maybe after you get him to ★★★★★ you can farm Yellow Jacket a bit just to unlock him so you can tag him along on the Ronan special mission so he could get levels at the same time you get your Ronan bios. This is what I am doing right now with my Gamora and Malekith, I am leveling them on the special missions along with Ronan."
FutureFight,3cmamp,Marc_Quill,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:12:27 2015 UTC,I already have YellowJacket and so it seems that I should lvl him to 40 as I make my Ronan 5*. Correct?
FutureFight,3cmamp,Augmentedforth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:20:31 2015 UTC,Just tag along another high level with the two of them just to be safe. You would be hitting two birds in one stone if you do this IMO. The special missions do give high hero exp.

Even though it is random from a list of 6 possible that day, I rather get ones that I want to focus more than just junk that piles up on Ghost Rider.

FutureFight,3cmyzh,jcmatteson,2,Thu Jul 9 04:34:02 2015 UTC,The missions look like they reset the same time as the daily refresh and it seems that every upgrade adds another mission to the list. Any heroes you send out don't become unusable for the duration and you get a free bio (maybe more?) when they come back.  The listed exp reward goes to your heroes. I find it weird that it's a flat amount because we don't get to see hero exp numbers anywhere else in the game.

FutureFight,3cmyzh,msde,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:44:05 2015 UTC,"The biometric converter is not amazing, but it's not too bad either. All depends on the bios that they give you. First lot were poor, but second one was a lot better after reset (Black Panther, Mockingbird, Red Skull, Black Cat and Captain Marvel)  I ended up changing one Iron Fist and One Ghost Rider for one Black Panther, so that's not a bad result - all depends on luck and the bio set it gives you.  Upgrading the converter will allow you to use it more times a day, so first upgrade will let you use it 3 times a day, compared to 2 which is default."
FutureFight,3cmyzh,msde,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:42:06 2015 UTC,"3 times a day   That settles it, thanks! I think I'll invest in it when I have more junk bios I can spare for conversion. Grats on that Panther result, definitely sounds worth what you put in."

FutureFight,3cksh3,detourne,2,Wed Jul 8 20:07:06 2015 UTC,You have to run in a specific angle in order to dodge them all.    I can't say specifically what that angle is without having the game in my hands though.  Sorry. =/

FutureFight,3cnr3d,Gpaint,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:56:58 2015 UTC,Tons of wonderful choices. What heroes do you like best?  Lots of good teams to go with. If you keep using spidey and add two new favorites it should be easy to hit the ground running
FutureFight,3cnr3d,Gpaint,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:04:54 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely like to keep using Spider-Man since he's got to be my favourite hero. Should team-up bonuses be sought after or are the bonuses just not worth it?  Since I've already invested in Spidey and Venom most than the rest, I think I'll keep them on my team (the bonus from them is a plus), but I'm not too sure on who to pick for the 3rd slot. Maybe Vision or Ultron since I have both their AoU uniforms and they're both also 30+, hm.... thoights?"
FutureFight,3cnr3d,tegeusCromis,3,Thu Jul 9 10:15:20 2015 UTC,"You have enough for team A, B, & C so it could be easier to think of it as two or more teams. You can drop venom and marvel and add Antman & Wasp for bug bite team which looks good.  You have Ronan/vision/ultron so there's another easy OP team right there"
FutureFight,3cnr3d,imjms737,2,Thu Jul 9 10:24:29 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with this. But if he wants to use Venom and Spidey, I'd suggest the popular (for good reason) choice of WM/Spidey/Venom. Balanced types, great leadership, and all three heroes are individually top-tier."
FutureFight,3cnr3d,Emceeguy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:22:53 2015 UTC,2nd this. WM (with Iron Patriot uniform)/SM/Venom is my A team.   Just love Spidey & Venom in and out of the game.  Great synergy!

I'd suggest using Evolution team (Giant Man, Ultron, Vision) as both Ultron and Giant Man are relatively easy to farm (both have special missions, with Ultron having 2 elites though I prolly guess you won't have the second open atm), and are all rather potent (especially Vision).      After that, get the trio to *5 preferably, or 4 if you are good at controls. You should be able to beat the rest of the chapters with them. Then you can customize any other char you like at efficient speeds and enjoy the game to the maximum!      Hope I helped."

FutureFight,3cn55p,hkbenlui,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:40:41 2015 UTC,It is not worth it if you don't like the character much.
FutureFight,3cn55p,MacStabby,2,Thu Jul 9 10:09:20 2015 UTC,"I am trying to figure the same thing out myself. Doing the math, if purchased individually it would work out as follows;   Uniform - 750 Gems Gold - 800 Gems Biometrics - (100 @ 1100 Gems, 40 @ 560 Gems and 10 @ 160 Gems) 1820 Gems Norn Stones - 200 Gems (I think) Exp Chips - 960 Gems (Again I think)   Total Gem Cost - 4530 Gems.  Buying the pack would save me 2030 Gems approximately, but would also reduce my total gems to below half, and im still trying to see if Vision will ever make an appearance in the flash sales for me lol."

FutureFight,3cn3eh,tylersjx,2,Thu Jul 9 04:44:24 2015 UTC,3rd Skill (Pulls enemy close) -> 1st Skill Aether Bolt (multi hit attack)  Rinse repeat? Aether Bolt does massive damage when up close. So massive that you can One hit kill Combat Heroes in Timeline Battle or take a huge chunk of Bosses's HP in Missions.

FutureFight,3cn3eh,chaoticheartld,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:55:43 2015 UTC,"Oh! Thanks! Somehow my damage is not amazing enough, and I don't know why. :( My malekith has no leadership, gears are all +5, Aether at level 25, Shadow at lvl 10, Extinguishing Darkness at level 25."
FutureFight,3cn3eh,Zephyraine,3,Thu Jul 9 05:20:08 2015 UTC,"A thing to keep in mind is that Aether Bolt doesn't always do its massive damage. It only does it part of the time, and then only when your target is snugged right up as close to you as possible.   A lot of people have this issue when they first start playing Malekith. They use his skills a few times, but never get Aether bolt to hit as hard as it can so they assume his damage is just okay. Then, one day, it suddenly does its max damage and drops someone instantly. That is the moment you realize just how amazing Malekith really is.  If you want to see what it potentially can do, there are videos on Youtube of people dropping 4 and 5 star Captain America's in the Arena instantly with a single Aether Bolt."
FutureFight,3cn3eh,Zephyraine,3,Thu Jul 9 05:42:30 2015 UTC,"That's why I said does massive damage up close. But before I that since OP said he was 3*, I thought I'd start out by saying using the guaranteed max damage combo, 3rd skill into 1st just to make sure he is as close as possible."
FutureFight,3cn3eh,Zephyraine,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:07:45 2015 UTC,Wow. Sounds amazing. Can't wait for that day to come!
FutureFight,3cn3eh,tegeusCromis,2,Thu Jul 9 06:00:34 2015 UTC,"Make your gears minimum +9. Gears from +5 to +9 can give a substantial amount of Energy Attack and other stats. Once your level 40, you can choose to put priority in leveling ur Aether Bolt to higher levels. Choose an ISO set for him as well because ISO set Bonuses can contribute to Attack power depending on which sets you choose (stick with sets that uses 6 slots of ISO because you will be stuck at Lv40 for quite some time)"
FutureFight,3cn3eh,crash100200,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:34:52 2015 UTC,ohhh. Any set in particular is good? Im using my gears now. Haha just ran out of energy. :X
FutureFight,3cn3eh,TheDessertFoxx,2,Thu Jul 9 05:59:10 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I can't really advise you on sets for Malekith as I don't main him. I can give you the general Consensus though. The Bloodthirst Set gives HP%, Attack% and has a shield that procs whenever you get hit. Basically an all rounder set. There are other recommended ones as well including Angels of Death and Animal Instinct too. You can look up the set bonus in-game."

FutureFight,3cngl7,tylersjx,4,Thu Jul 9 07:14:03 2015 UTC,There's someone talking about using Hawkeye with him because a lot of his skills (all of them maybe?) are multi-hit. Electra would be another good one. A lot of speed characters are actually.
FutureFight,3cngl7,SageofLogic,3,Thu Jul 9 07:16:05 2015 UTC,"I think the highest DPS is probably going to be taken by Yellowjacket, himself. Still early, but it is possible.  As far as other characters with high Damage Per Second, the list is pretty settled. Most have their own opinion of who is number 1, but just about everyone can agree on the top three or so. Angela, Gamora, Vision; with War Machine also being in there somewhere.  Malekith is easily king of the single-target burst damage, and no one is even in the same ball-park as him, but his DPS is a different story. He has to spend some of his time kiting waiting for Aether bolt and grasp to come back.  If I had to pick one, and it was against a stationary target that you didn't have to worry about attacking back, I would probably give it to Angela. Angel's War Rage just does a ton of damage on a very short cooldown. Angela's skill rotation just isn't as safe as the others, so you waste some time trying to get a good opening to jump in and attack."
FutureFight,3cngl7,chaoticheartld,3,Thu Jul 9 10:30:55 2015 UTC,"biggest hits come from vision. his phase can do 10k+ without critting. The fact that his beam tracks new targets after he kills means he has some good sustain too.  For straight up dps? i dont know. there arent any dummies.  I do know i kill bosses the fastest with angela on a ronan led team, but his mastery skews that a lot."
FutureFight,3cngl7,TheDessertFoxx,5,Thu Jul 9 22:31:40 2015 UTC,Gamora comes to mind.
FutureFight,3cngl7,CountHalphas,-1,Thu Jul 9 07:28:19 2015 UTC,+1
FutureFight,3cngl7,Kinrubich,4,Thu Jul 9 07:35:21 2015 UTC,I'd say Vision is probably the highest DPS.  However I don't have Gamora levelled up yet.  My Angela stays very on par with Vision if not better.
FutureFight,3cngl7,hohndo,2,Thu Jul 9 07:28:55 2015 UTC,Id say Gamora or Vision
FutureFight,3cngl7,CallKidLiquid,2,Thu Jul 9 08:12:18 2015 UTC,Gamora hands down
FutureFight,3cngl7,agent_patrick_star,2,Thu Jul 9 08:58:10 2015 UTC,I'd say Angela if she's able to use War Rage everytime its up.
FutureFight,3cngl7,kaige,2,Thu Jul 9 09:39:21 2015 UTC,"And it doesn't whiff 80% of its damage as it sometimes does, then yeah. Considering the damage it does and the 6 second cooldown, she could probably top the chart. Gamora's skill rotation is safer, though, as is Vision's. Kind of moot, though, as they are all capable of some serious DPS."
FutureFight,3cngl7,chaoticheartld,2,Thu Jul 9 10:26:14 2015 UTC,If you need tank maybe go with venom. 2 of his attacks is multi hit. and 5* is fear attack.
FutureFight,3cngl7,ugglefitteskinn,2,Thu Jul 9 10:40:11 2015 UTC,"Here's something else you might want to consider:  Star Lord's Leadership skill level 6 boosts Blast heroes energy attack by 45%. With YJ's DPS already being incredibly high, pairing him with star lord will absolutely let him steamroll through just about anything."

FutureFight,3cmqa2,zaShadow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:56:20 2015 UTC,Ignore Dodge. I wish there would be a skill cool down % for it though.
FutureFight,3cmqa2,Zephyraine,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:15:30 2015 UTC,"If there was, it would be the most broken Gear in game atm. Assuming the same % as dodge and crit gears, a 40% cooldown gear stacked with Iron Man's 5* %leadership of 20% Cooldown along with ISO set Bonus for 7% Cooldown.... that's the true definition of skill spamming."
FutureFight,3cmqa2,zaShadow,0,Thu Jul 9 03:30:31 2015 UTC,"Even so, Skill spamming alone does not determine an easy victory.   Edit: To that one person; There are effects to counter skill move or such spamming if ever occurs. So lighten up, Pal."
FutureFight,3cmqa2,Zephyraine,4,Thu Jul 9 04:15:13 2015 UTC,"It does for characters with safe moves (ergo stun/break/rapid fire hitstun) and Density Shift Spam. Having to wait less for Density Shift mean you don't have to risk taking a Critical Hit from a Boss or just damage in general. Same with other safe abilities that either grants invulnerability upon skill or making enemies immobile/hitstun. And yes, this applies to manual play with Kiting. Chapter 8 Elite pretty much requires you to use the 'do damage without taking much on your own' strategy which can be tough without exploiting shifters or having 5* and above characters.  For characters with less safe moves then yes, it doesn't really change anything since it all depends on how tanky they are because they can't really avoid hits during their skill. But it does make victories easier and faster for characters who do."
FutureFight,3cmqa2,hkbenlui,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:35:30 2015 UTC,"That's why they are probably not going to make cooldown gears, at least not 40%"
FutureFight,3cmqa2,Gpaint,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:05:43 2015 UTC,Especially because a maxed alliance will provide a flat 10% reduction already
FutureFight,3cmqa2,zaShadow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:20:51 2015 UTC,"I was generalizing the facts and base on what could counter skill moves, which already been implemented in this game (silence effect, look up Wasp passive) and also, if you happen to run Hawkeye rifts before, you would better understand why i stated ""not an easy victory"";Still possible but not as always easy.  Don't you know this type of genre will always have constant updates and a balance in everything?"
FutureFight,3cmqa2,Zephyraine,0,Fri Jul 10 02:35:31 2015 UTC,"My scenario is general. I said it will instantly boost characters with safe moves. Density shift was just an example. I don't deny that there are constant updates to the game but it does not mean that it is balanced in any way. We don't feel the impacts of imbalance much yet due to the fact that there is an absence of an actual real time PVP mode. But that's exactly the point, even without an actual PVP mode we can already see the imbalance. Tell me that it's balanced after you fight 40% dodge boosted teams in Timeline battle that is out there right now. Now imagine skill cooldown right there. In that hypothetical scenario, assuming everyone runs Silence Teams with Wasp etc. I wouldnt exactly call that balance anymore either if they need to run specific teams to counter gears rather than counter opposing teams."
FutureFight,3cmqa2,zaShadow,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:44:56 2015 UTC,"With the fifth gear in-place it give only to one boost. There is not a need to assume and start imagining things.   Yes, I did face 40% dodge boosted team before; Spidey 5, BW 5 and DD 5. Those are obvious high dodge heroes. And how i knew all equipped boosted gears was when during fights, Dodging happened way often than those without. I won over them by using high DPS heroes like venom 5 that hits harder and rapidly, in addition with fear effects or stun. Easily, 1 combat can take down 2 speed."
FutureFight,3cmqa2,Zephyraine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:11:46 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't the single boost but the percentage it gives. A character shouldnt be able to get hit by a hitstun move (like laser beams) and just because he dodged one hit he will run through it towards you. As I said in a previous post, War Machine has safe moves yet when fighting 40% dodge heroes they dodge his armor clash break, and run through his repulsor beams from a single dodge. That should not be happening. Same with other characters with safe hitstun moves.  Plus, you don't tell that a Team has 40% dodge by feeling how much they dodge. You KNOW they have 40% dodge gear by tapping on the Special gear buff icon next to the hero's portrait. It drectly tells you the buff right there with the %.   With Cooldown% assuming 40% like dodge, there's no way you can fight an AI that keeps going Missile Barrage, Aether Bolt, Density Shift, Web shot all the time without using Silence Teams or spamming your own skills faster than AI. That's a broken game right there."
FutureFight,3cmqa2,PolishTamales,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:20:44 2015 UTC,"If a character has a few good multi-hit moves (Venom) they can afford to drop Dodge Ignore and go straight to Critical Hit. Even if he does face dodge equipped opponents, his multi-hitting moves will be still good and won't be detrimental to his DPS. In addition to that, many of them are already Speed type characters, which already gives him an accuracy bonus against that match-up.  If a character only has 1 good multi-hit special (Captain Marvel) and are on point, then Ignore Dodge would be more beneficial since she can't afford to miss as a burst damage character.  There's also the type consideration as well. Against a character's weakness (Malekith vs. Spidey) Even if Malekith has ignore dodge, it would still be a poor match-up overall and you're more likely to switch out characters anyway.  Ignore dodge boosters tend to be more rewarding for on point Universal characters. Specifically if they don't have a lot of multi-hitting moves (5+ hits)."
FutureFight,3cmqa2,SenpaiSpadesz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:31:53 2015 UTC,I do the vision run and boost his magic dmg
FutureFight,3cmo9v,Rich_DR,2,Thu Jul 9 02:30:43 2015 UTC,"Do you force close right when the mission starts, during, or after the mission completed?"
FutureFight,3cmo9v,danieldaypumpkintits,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:38:46 2015 UTC,"I run the mission, and after finishing go back to the main screen, that's when I force close."
FutureFight,3cmo9v,Nueko,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:43:45 2015 UTC,"wait, so i have to finish the mission and after victory pose, rewards screen, etc. and going back to main menu then force close the game?"
FutureFight,3cmo9v,Zephyraine,2,Thu Jul 9 02:48:18 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's the way I've done it so far, that's why I compared it to PKRS in Pokémon, where you always need to at least be in a fight before it spreads."
FutureFight,3cmo9v,Zephyraine,3,Thu Jul 9 02:50:53 2015 UTC,"Didnt work for me. I had a Hulk as Leader with Best Condition. IM and WM as the other 2 characters that I wanted the condition to spread to. Ran a Normal 7-8. Finished it, Clicked Replay at the Rewards Screen. Then once It brought me back to the mission page where I can press the button to spend 4 energy to play again, I force closed. Then restarted the game, and still no Best Condition for WM or IM."
FutureFight,3cmo9v,Zephyraine,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"Try clicking to go straight back to the main menu after the mission rewards screen pops up, and once on the main menu force close, please let us know how it goes."
FutureFight,3cmo9v,Grand_Savage,3,Thu Jul 9 03:04:01 2015 UTC,Tried that right after and it didn't work. Basically whether I click Replay to go back to Mission menu or whether I click Straight back to Main Menu and then force closing does not 'spread' the Best condition status. All these while I had Hulk with Best Condition as Leader with two other characters without the condition.
FutureFight,3cmo9v,Nueko,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:06:07 2015 UTC,I'll do 10 runs to burn out the Best Condition status on 3 of my older characters to do some more testing.
FutureFight,3cmo9v,cuakevinlex,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:11:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it matters, but while Hulk is the leader I didn't use him to finish the run. IM clears the stage much faster so I pretty much swap out from Hulk to IM at the beginning of the stage all the way to the end. But in the Team formation, Hulk is the Leader."

But thing is i got 1500 which is max(image 1). But look at the upper right, it's 1445(image 1). I don't think there's a 55 AP worth item in game. Anyway, long story short it's probably just a glitch."
FutureFight,3ck8x5,AsperKaos,4,Wed Jul 8 15:47:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, the game is much more generous compared to Contest of Champions. You can actually just grind for the characters you want instead of having to be lucky or getting the same characters over and over.   I love how we even get free crystals sometimes after a patch (even though I'm never online during downtime)."
FutureFight,3ck8x5,shotterken,2,Wed Jul 8 16:49:40 2015 UTC,"Congrats on getting one of your favorites early on! I managed to pull War Machine in a biometric chest on my first day (this was before flash sales were a thing) and he's been my workhorse ever since. Not only do I love Rhodey as a character, he's been a great hero in FF. Shortly thereafter I unlocked Iron Fist, who is my all-time favorite superhero. I've got him at level 40 with 4 stars even though he's not really that great. Can't help myself. I love the big dope."

FutureFight,3ck8x5,Abbhrsn,2,Wed Jul 8 17:40:58 2015 UTC,I just unlocked 5 stars on War Machine last night. Tried out his missile barrage in Arena today. o_0 that does a lot of damage. Just solo KOed a 40/4/4 JI team with War Machine.
FutureFight,3ck8x5,pksullivan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:03:23 2015 UTC,"I could Solo KO JI Teams back when WarMachine was only 4star. The only damage dealer is Capt Marvel and her Tracking Spirit Bomb move. Venom and Spidey are both kite baits. Spidey's web shot and Venoms homing 3rd skill can be stopped with Armor Clash. Basically, WarMachine just says Get Rekt to JI teams. At 5* he should be destroying teams at a dimensional level. And don't even get me started on the day they finally add a 6* move to Warmachine as they did to Spidey and BW..."

FutureFight,3cn5s1,PolishTamales,4,Thu Jul 9 05:08:02 2015 UTC,Its random. I've seen her appear in stage 1 elites before 0_0 then stage 8 :/
FutureFight,3cn5s1,crash100200,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:58:19 2015 UTC,"Same here. I've seen her multiple times on Ultron's ch 1 elite mission, but also on elite BW ch 3 and assorted normal missions. (From recent memory; I'm sure I have seen her elsewhere too.)"

FutureFight,3cn5s1,mstheterror,0,Thu Jul 9 05:24:01 2015 UTC,What are the other possible shifters you've experienced on 7-8?
FutureFight,3cn5s1,SageofLogic,2,Thu Jul 9 05:28:25 2015 UTC,"pretty sure it's random i farm 7-8 for mats too, pretty much never see her there,  i get a lot of rockets tho"
FutureFight,3cn5s1,hohndo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:30:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a handful of unique characters that appear in specific stages along side with some common ones (Luke Cage, Rocket, etc).   Black Cat for example, will appear mainly in Spider-Man & Iron Man stages, but I almost never see her pop up in others. As the case with Angela, I've never actually seen her as a Shifter."
FutureFight,3cn5s1,SageofLogic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:34:33 2015 UTC,I have noticed Black Cat popping up in Spidey and Venom stages :D Maybe it has something to do with strikers?
FutureFight,3cn5s1,SageofLogic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:41:21 2015 UTC,That's an interesting theory. I've gotten Hulkbuster and War Machine to appear with their respective partner bios.   Who are the bosses on these stages that Angela appears in?
FutureFight,3cn1e6,OvrDriveZer0,3,Thu Jul 9 04:25:21 2015 UTC,"Giant Man, with his costume when you eventually get it. He's swiftly looking to be one of the better balanced between tanking and damage combat characters in the game and you get the ""Teacher and Student"" 2 person bonus with YJ."
FutureFight,3cn1e6,SageofLogic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:00:09 2015 UTC,"Hmm! Interesting, I'll test him out once I get him and maybe get myself the goliath package as well."
FutureFight,3cn1e6,Gpaint,3,Thu Jul 9 15:00:40 2015 UTC,Yondu is perfect to go with hawkeye. He's very very good now that he's been fixed. His 3rd skill has the most multi hits I've seen yet in game when used in aoe situations. Yondu is a 20% striker for YJ too
FutureFight,3cn1e6,crash100200,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:12:10 2015 UTC,I agree! Yondu is one of my go to VS killers and his arrow barrage just wrecks them. I test him out in the team when I get the chance. I haven't checked out his strikers but it's good to know that he has striker synergy with YJ. Thanks!
FutureFight,3cn1e6,rastaration,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:03:14 2015 UTC,How bout wasp. Another cc character :D
FutureFight,3cn1e6,ign-Dextr0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:28:44 2015 UTC,"Indeed! She has a multi-hit 1st skill which is quite good, any idea if it does breaks as well? Her passive is awesome since it can stop enemies from using skills, and blind is always good to have although I don't think it's that effective of a debuff... but would she be the better choice over Red Hulk running the tank role? If I bring Wasp the team wouldn't have a tank and I think the team would be quite fragile... still, I'll give her a try when I get her up to 4*!"
FutureFight,3cn1e6,TheDessertFoxx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:43:38 2015 UTC,"Kingpin, if your after combat with stun/breaker. I don't know how either would synergize with your team though. I hear he's a great boss killer."
FutureFight,3cmxzg,Skripclub,2,Thu Jul 9 03:54:01 2015 UTC,"Wasp seems to be good on paper honestly. It's hard not to ignore her leadership ability and overall utility of her move sets. Give her a dodge booster, Health Regen/Shield ISO combo, and I can see her being very effective on point.  Ant-Man is trickier since I've had a terrible time trying to get his bios to drop while farming Yellow Jacket. Maybe it's the RNG that day, but just be aware he'll be the hardest Bio to farm compared to Spidey/Wasp.  Seems like a good team, but Wasp is the key selling point right now."
FutureFight,3cmxzg,PolishTamales,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:51:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely. She is great at. I have her at level 34 and she can hold her own. With the combo of random shifters and chaos (I can beat level 9 daily) I can get at least 9 bios a day from vs, and then whatever drops from YJ.   Ant-man being 4* out of the box comes out already viable, once exp tokens used. Spidey is 5* 45 and already beastly.   Thanks for the input on how to manage wasp, that will help."
FutureFight,3cmxzg,Thesparkone,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:57:39 2015 UTC,"She seems pretty good against Doc Ock in VS. It looks like with one of her skills she goes through the lasers without taking damage, and the other attack (I only have her at 2*) stops him and hits him a bunch of times, plus she's got the class advantage."
FutureFight,3cmxzg,SageofLogic,2,Thu Jul 9 15:56:45 2015 UTC,"I think Bug Bites is going to be super solid once people start hitting 5* on Wasp and Ant Man. Everyone equips dodge boosters and you just sort of go to town and Wasp's 3* skill can reduce the cooldown on Spidey's shiny new 6*. You can even use Spidey as a leader to crank the dodge from ""Amazing"" to ""Superior""."
FutureFight,3cmxzg,shreinhart,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:13:53 2015 UTC,I just ran yellow jacket lvl3 15-20 times. not a single shifter appeared.
FutureFight,3cmxzg,PolishTamales,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:48:40 2015 UTC,Did you clear the story mode yet?   Meaning beating all the special stages at least once?
FutureFight,3cmxzg,PolishTamales,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:54:20 2015 UTC,"Also, there is a known bug. If you have done your regular/elite farming and got your 20 shifter quota, for some reason the unlimited shifters will not show up in special missions. So, you need to run specials BEFORE elites. I read that they will still be unlimited and don't count towards your quota, but if you run them before elites. Netmarble knows and is supposed to be working on it."
FutureFight,3clz8g,SageofLogic,3,Wed Jul 8 23:09:17 2015 UTC,yeah his electron channeling is a lot better. he was doing very well in siege mode. i still think they need to fix his first scream because it just misses people that are right in front of him.
FutureFight,3clz8g,rikiking16,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:43:56 2015 UTC,"yeah this does happen a lot if they are moving into or out of the range as the skill goes off.  Similar to his ult, if they move into the radius of the damage as the skill is channeling they are unaffected which seems strange to me as the damage is in waves like a pulse."
FutureFight,3clz8g,skyzvengeance,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:55:25 2015 UTC,I put dodge ignore on mine and that for the most part fixed the bad accuracy on his scream.
FutureFight,3clz8g,tegeusCromis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:11:30 2015 UTC,"Does dodge ignore really help? I thought this was a hitbox issue, not a dodge issue."
FutureFight,3clz8g,curlyguy21,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:32:17 2015 UTC,It felt half and half to me so I mixed up where I triggered it with the dodge ignore. Which also helps with his other skills too.
FutureFight,3clz8g,thethirst,3,Thu Jul 9 15:38:19 2015 UTC,I would be more excited about this if they hadn't removed him from the honor token shop. I am so annoyed right now...

FutureFight,3cju0l,hunterkakashi,7,Wed Jul 8 13:51:42 2015 UTC,makes sense. i recall that the ally shifters in the ant man special mission are unlimited. wouldn't it be a nit much for their drops to be 100%? Nice balance.
FutureFight,3cju0l,orpwhite,2,Wed Jul 8 14:32:49 2015 UTC,"I agree.  While it would be awesome to get a guaranteed biometric for every Ant Man special mission (Wasp and Ant Man as well), I think that'd be a bit broken.  Getting them like 75% of the time is just fine with me."

FutureFight,3ckot1,Spedwards,5,Wed Jul 8 17:41:41 2015 UTC,It resets a single character. Worth 100k gold? Probably not.

FutureFight,3cmlp7,Ozeagle,2,Thu Jul 9 02:56:46 2015 UTC,"That's rather frustrating, explains why I've never had a shifter in the new special missions.  Thanks for the insight!"
FutureFight,3cmlp7,rikiking16,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:16:05 2015 UTC,"you get daily shifters?? if so, how many?"
FutureFight,3cmlp7,skyzvengeance,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:02:37 2015 UTC,You get 10 ally and 10 enemy shifters per day in normal/elite missions however there is no limit of shifters for ant specials
FutureFight,3cmlp7,Jplato09,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:06:00 2015 UTC,"Not to me... Actually haven't had any trouble regarding the shifters showing up in the new special missions, but I think it's bound to happen since so many people had troubles"
FutureFight,3cmlp7,Jplato09,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:26:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks, yeah it's really strange.  Yesterday was fine, and then today when I started to run the new special missions this happened. Not sure what I did to glitch it.  Well at least still getting Yellowjacket bios. :)"
FutureFight,3cmlp7,skyzvengeance,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:36:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah... But still, if you can run 10-15 missions in the no-limit but no shifters appear, you're still losing out on 5-7 shifter bios... That needs fixing quick"
FutureFight,3cmlp7,Jplato09,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:46:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I can do 10 to 11 missions per no-limit going between 10-4 and 10-5. Saw the comment that they count towards your daily shifters total limit. So will have to re-adjust how I play then.
FutureFight,3cmlp7,skyzvengeance,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:58:39 2015 UTC,"My comment was not meant to be interpreted that they count for your daily shifter limit as they do not.  You could do unlimited ant specials while never stop getting shifters but when you start to farm normals and elite missions and hit your limit there, no more shifters will spawn if you go back to the ant special missions.  Sorry if that was confusing"
FutureFight,3cmlp7,Jplato09,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:03:08 2015 UTC,Oh I see! Okay got it.  Well still does change my normal morning routine. :)
FutureFight,3cmlp7,muffinman331,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:08:09 2015 UTC,So... basically the fix for that is doing the Special mission farming before doing normal and elite farming?

FutureFight,3cmjwi,SageofLogic,2,Thu Jul 9 02:03:13 2015 UTC,I think YJ should strike with Giant Man and Ant Man since they have the team up of all the identities Pym has had.
FutureFight,3cmjwi,tom641,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:52:24 2015 UTC,"That makes sense from a story standpoint. It's a minor frustration when the majority of the team's, most especially ""Team Pym"", are the ones Yellow Jacket ends up in rather than more villain based teams."

FutureFight,3cjubz,Jplato09,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:15:41 2015 UTC,I saw 10 for 200.  That's in line for the bad value flash sales.  Maybe they have a chance for the better value sales as well.
FutureFight,3cjubz,TheLostOne3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:53:20 2015 UTC,The range on the flash sales is 11-16 I think so this is significantly worse.

FutureFight,3cjubz,Gpaint,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:55:12 2015 UTC,"For the bios, just doesn't make sense to purchase.  Since it is random anyways, and only 5, they really should be charging around 100 for 5.  To make it really attractive, make it purchaseable for gold, like 100k, otherwise, I highly doubt they'll get many bites for the bios."
FutureFight,3cjubz,Blitqz21l,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:17:43 2015 UTC,Maybe they will reduce bio appearance in flash sales.

FutureFight,3ckri2,toysoldierxiii,3,Wed Jul 8 19:40:28 2015 UTC,Abso****inglutely. 2/3rds of the time he is statistically the best attacker AND tank in the game (without teams or leaderships in play). His basic attacks hit fast and hard and his skills move around like Gamora's only they are all gigantic AoEs.  Most importantly however he is hands down the most fun I've had playing this game.
FutureFight,3ckri2,SasukexDJr,2,Wed Jul 8 20:01:04 2015 UTC,He seems very lackluster and unreliable tho :/.. convince me hes not

FutureFight,3ckri2,SageofLogic,2,Wed Jul 8 20:20:08 2015 UTC,Yeah the only weak point on that team is how hard farming Ant Man is.
FutureFight,3ckdml,MacStabby,11,Wed Jul 8 16:21:49 2015 UTC,"I may be in the minority here, but I DON'T want a clan game. I have played CoC and WoH enough that i'm sick of it. A couple team missions and some team perks are enough. Any more clan-based and they are taking away what made this game so great in the first place. I don't want to feel forced to perform or I will be cut, and I don't want to feel like I am carrying everybody or that I need to babysit others to get them to perform."

FutureFight,3ckdml,AsteroidMiner,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:50:56 2015 UTC,"CoC.... ugh. I think the issue with that game is the 24/7 game play style needed as well as an endless pocket to keep paying.  But seriously, I dont think the suggestion above makes it your typical 'Clan' game. Its enough for alliance members to have to do a reasonable amount to warrant having alliances, but not too much to the point you have to be in a top tier alliance.  Additionally although I did say sweeten the rewards a little more, my suggestions hardly offer anything you cannot get already and as such being a solo player is no great disadvantage over a group that wants to pull together per se."

FutureFight,3ckdml,SageofLogic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:34:24 2015 UTC,Oh crap yeah that won't happen. We got the Elite one so it just means everyone does a few more Elites than usual and people farming multiple character bios make up for anyone not.

I like the idea of working together, they did that right, but there needs to be challenge that requires communication which is the factor that distinguishes good guilds from bad ones.

FutureFight,3ckdml,Thesparkone,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:07:14 2015 UTC,"My point was not to say I dont want free stuff. It was actually to say that with the reward being so 'meh' only more dedicated players may feel the urge to complete eacha nd every achieve and more normal players will see it and think...'not worth me spending that extra half hour just for a bit of energy'.  In other words, its hardly a reward that gets you excited."
FutureFight,3ckdml,Thesparkone,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:33:51 2015 UTC,"The achievements are very easy to complete, so I don't really see your point. My Alliance completed the Weekly in under a day. If a bunch of the members aren't willing to complete easy achievements, then they may want to go join a super-casual alliance. Ours was complete 900 Elite Missions. When you have a week to do it, then that averages out to about 4 Elite Missions a day per member. 10 people can do 900 in a week easy. The Dailies that I've seen are also super-easy."

Its not whether they are super easy or anything. But I have more energy floating about than most, probably cause I manage my free energy from achieves really well, as well as the freebie ones from gm's etc.  So to see an achieve offer me yet another 50, for doing 1500 timeline battles or 900 elite stages, its meh. Im crapping energy.  My point (as it originally was) is instead of give us more of the same, make the way the alliance achieves work slightly different and a little more exciting. Hmm, would I prefer 5 Biometrics from a certain character or 50 energy.... No brainer for me.."

FutureFight,3cm9z4,idkmybffljill,4,Thu Jul 9 00:34:59 2015 UTC,Your top 3 are all Universal so I'd suggest farming Ronan and the relevant missions/shops for the other two you pick whether it is Vision and Ultron or Vision and Captain Marvel. Destroyer is really hard to farm so I don't think that is a good pick. Ultron and Vision is a more reliable team as well.
FutureFight,3cm9z4,SageofLogic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:39:16 2015 UTC,"This. Ronan is easily obtainable due to his special missions, once you get him to level 40 ★★★★ with level 10+ gears and level 25 skills he can solo his special mission 4 so you can tag along 2 low levels with you. I have an Ultron x Vision X Ronan team as my main, just got them to level 40 since I am just 13 days old in this game. Destroyer, if you get lucky enough, is more viable than Ultron as what I heard but the farmability of his bios is the issue. Plus the uniforms of Ultron is a huge plus for me although I am still saving for them. Captain Marvel is said to fall off when she reaches rank 4 and above compared to other universals of the same rank and level."
FutureFight,3cm9z4,CountHalphas,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:05:03 2015 UTC,I actually switched out Ultron for Thor because Worthy Ones and Thor's outfit and the Lightning special gear makes Thor pretty useful. His jump attacks have been missing less than Ultron's for me.

FutureFight,3cm9z4,ConcealedTerror,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:05:43 2015 UTC,I don't see a solid easily farmable +1 there for him though. Maybe Captain Falcon for Avengers Assemble! as well. That could be pretty good if WM is set in stone.
FutureFight,3cm9z4,SageofLogic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:14:00 2015 UTC,"That really isn't that many heroes...I only have 5 I still haven't gotten yet. The way I play with that many champions is to simply train those that I like and also look at the team bonuses. Take opinions from others into account but in the end, it's your team and you that's playing, so your enjoyment should come above all else.  The rest I just level with exp chips to lvl 20/gear 5/ skill 10 so they actually stand a chance in VS when I need to knock off the last 5% of a boss's hp."
FutureFight,3clg7b,macewindu007,7,Wed Jul 8 20:46:43 2015 UTC,"I have Wasp at 4* / level 40.   I have War Machine at 6* level 50 and Vision at 5* level 45.  I played WM and Vision heavily as I was leveling and ranking them up.  Wasp is not as good as either of them.  It's not really even a close comparison.  I think she is a support character, if there is such thing in this game.  Basically, you'd be using her for her leadership and her 3* skill  (the 3* skill drops a circle on the ground where she swaps out like Groot's healing circle.  If it's active on her it follows her, but not when she swaps).  I'd see something like  Wasp, drop her skill CD circle, Groot drop his heal circle, then swap into some heavy range guy that will just stand there and blast.  Maybe Red Skull because his CD is so short already or Rocket.  She is not a plow type character that can pull two characters through level 52-53 missions with no swaps or heals."
FutureFight,3clg7b,Sho1va,4,Wed Jul 8 21:49:29 2015 UTC,Dude she just came out.. How do people power level these people to level 40 in under 24 hours... I MUST KNOW!
FutureFight,3clg7b,bobsponge933,2,Thu Jul 9 01:43:05 2015 UTC,$$$$$$$
FutureFight,3clg7b,toysoldierxiii,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:09:10 2015 UTC,"Actually it takes no $$$ as the person below may think. You have one character at 5* and if you were in since beta you would by now. You get an alliance with 3% hero xp, the hero xp event going on, and if you want to spend $ you can pu 135 crystals for a day pass of xp.   Then you do the level 52 daily 10 times with the noob character in tow. Then you do 5x level 5 special missions and the corresponding no limit special mission. Run that set twice. Your character will be 40 before you finish."
FutureFight,3clg7b,Sho1va,2,Thu Jul 9 02:16:25 2015 UTC,"that's really interesting, but how much must you invest in the 3* skill for the skill cooldown to have any effect?  because at level it's just skill cool down +10  that's like 10% of a level 1 native gear"
FutureFight,3clg7b,ign-Dextr0,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:07:35 2015 UTC,I'm guessing to fully maximize potential you have to go max skill which is +463

FutureFight,3clg7b,Sho1va,2,Thu Jul 9 00:10:57 2015 UTC,"I agree but to be fair you are comparing her to two gods. She is at least solid, better than most blasters, has a decent but universally applicable leadership, and her teams are pretty good.  She is definitely worth farming and gearing and should have a spot on most people's B or C team."
FutureFight,3clg7b,toysoldierxiii,3,Wed Jul 8 23:46:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree. But I just thought I saw someone say she was better than war machine and I was like whoa there
FutureFight,3clg7b,Sho1va,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:10:18 2015 UTC,She also has 2 skills that inflict status conditions and her passive causes her to also inflict silence occasionally. All pluses for her.

FutureFight,3clg7b,Sho1va,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:01:11 2015 UTC,Her stun skill also randomly breaks and as a multihit attack I have that break occur every 2-3 times I use it.

FutureFight,3clg7b,ArekkusuRin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:31:27 2015 UTC,"this is the trade off, assuming all maxed:  for 12% physical attack boost which you lose from WM compared to wasp, as leads, you get:  18% defense, 6% atk speed, boost to both energy and phy. attacks, silence skill, speed debuff, skill cooldown (if you decide you have too much $)  i never liked WM that much, it's great at one thing, but wasp is obv jack of all trades across the board  if you ask me that's an easy choice, depends you want pure teams or flexibility, i prolly prefer latter"
FutureFight,3clg7b,ign-Dextr0,2,Wed Jul 8 21:43:24 2015 UTC,"the thing is, WarMachine is extremely tanky especially for a blast hero[Mines has 10.3k HP]. On top of that, his skills has a lot of hit stun as well as an actual stun. He just takes down bosses or pretty much anything without trouble; even against speed heroes of the same level. All of this makes him very valuable in villain siege, arena, story mode against level 50+ enemies and bosses. Wasp just looks like a good leader but very squishy to me."
FutureFight,3clg7b,ArekkusuRin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:52:27 2015 UTC,"She may not actually end up being that squishy in the end. She also gets native HP on her gear. If her skills also have decent break/hit-stun on them, she will have comparable survivability. I think WM is still going to outclass her on damage, though, by a decent margin.  Over-all, so far, she has been really fun to play, but I don't get the ""Oh my god, this character is obviously so powerful!"" feeling from her. That may change at 4 or 5*, but we will see."
FutureFight,3clg7b,chaoticheartld,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:47:19 2015 UTC,"Wasp is nowhere near War Machine / Vision / Malekith. Thos are top tier characters. While she's nice for a blaster, lets face the fact that most blasters are absolutely horrible. The bar isn't set very high.  I have her 3* level 35, 9 gear and I'm giving up on her. She has a hard time soloing missions that are 5-10 levels under her. Meanwhile my Angela or Ronan can solo equal level Elite missions no problem.   Her leadership is okay, her damage is okay, but she's extremely squishy and her 3* skill is a buff unfortunately."

Also, in my opinion, very slow. Higher damage is useless if you're attacking at a rate 1/3 of some of the other characters."
FutureFight,3cm0c4,dee_jay8,2,Wed Jul 8 23:36:38 2015 UTC,Everything is typically discussed comparatively around here even if it's intended to be unbiased. He's not bad at all but against the top 5-6 he's inferior by comparison.   I have fought 5* hulks in arena and they can do a lot of damage. He is also good vs destroyer in VS. Comics would have you think of him at indestructible but in this game he seems like more of a glass cannon or rush character.
FutureFight,3cm0c4,Gpaint,2,Wed Jul 8 23:35:45 2015 UTC,"slow attack speed, slow movement speed, long skill animation, no breaks/ stuns"

FutureFight,3cm0c4,knightzeemo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:34:24 2015 UTC,"I like him but I feel he should be tweaked to be much better. Not necessarily top-tier (though that would be nice), but just... better. I dunno, its just that he seems outclassed now by Rulk and that's just wrong. Hulk needs to have something very special about him now.  Also, since using him as a Destroyer buster has been mentioned, kinda OT, but who's a great second Destroyer buster? I want to save my some day 5 star Hulk for Stage 9 VS but sometimes you end up with two late stage Destroyers."

FutureFight,3clz4s,muffinman331,3,Wed Jul 8 23:08:32 2015 UTC,"I am new too, 13 days in. Shield level 27. I have a level 40 Ronan ★★★★★, level 40 UVision ★★★ (18 bios away to ★★★☆), and a level 40 Ultron ☆☆☆ (20 bios away to ☆☆☆☆).   The uniform for Vision is a great investment. If you have the crystals for it then buy it. Works great when paired with Ronan because of his leadership. It is generally accepted that you should at least unlock characters for their bonus in the Arena. You should probably decide and concentrate on your main team, at least bring them up to level 40 this will help you breeze through the game. In my opinion, you should probably change your main team, probably with better synergy and individual strength like the Journalistic Intergrity , Marvel included, since I heard that it makes your journey through the story mode and elite missions a breeze and individually the heroes on JI is strong on Villain Siege. You could also use a *Ronan** x Vision (with uniform) X Angela. Ronan's leadership once mastered is no joke. You can sometimes substitute Angela for Malekith since Malekith and Ronan have a team bonus and combo. I equipped Dodge Ignore on my Ronan because he already has slow attack speed and it pisses me off when it misses due to the enemy's dodge. I equipped Dodge on Vision to help with his ""squishiness"". Recovery Boost help on the hp regeneration you get from heal from breakables (the one you get from mobs or from hitting things), from hero heals like Groot and from the VIP healing when a hero tags out. [needs confirmation] Train Malekith. He is a beast on Villain Siege and on the Arena."
FutureFight,3clz4s,CountHalphas,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:52:13 2015 UTC,"As far as bio farming goes i would say farm the ones you like. It most definitely makes the game a lot more fun. But if i have to name some specific i would say:  Vision - seeing you already got him and he's a beast  Ronan - As pointed out in the text and you simply can't say no to that mastery bonus!  War Machine - for that sweet new teambonus with vision.  Anyways, this is my main team for now, ofc have a JI team and som other ones i am working on Special gear is quite easy, the higher the rift lvl, the bether the gear gets.  Poison - Goblin   Fire - Red Hulk/GR   Crit: BP and other good crit hitters.  Dodge: Spidey    and so on...  And for your last point uniform: Imo some uniforms are worth it. If your mains have an uniform available, go for it! I currently have WM and vision as well as falcon. WM and vision are mains and i just couldn't say no to falcon. They are expencive to choose wisley"
FutureFight,3clz4s,Adriano95,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:41:36 2015 UTC,"1) So first of all, you should focus on maxing out your main team to level 40 and getting them to 4*. Get their gears to +9 or +10, get some iso that you don't need and put on them (you can max out the iso and spend a good buck with it later) Also, if you can, level their skills to 20 or so, so that they do good damage. JI, although it is very common, is a good team early on, and if you want to focus on it and you like the heroes you should. As to the third team, try to level Malekith as he's very good damage wise.  2) As for the special gears, slow resist is in fact very good for Bullseye. Poison can go on GG, dodge ignore can go to anyone who does good damage to boost it even more and the crit boost does good as well.   3) Uniforms are worth it! Since your main team features Cap A and Vision, their uniforms are really good as they give a 10% boost to stats and special effects. Particularly, Vision's uniform makes him even crazier, and Cap America's uniform gives him some immunity for a period of time. Vision is crazy good with or without the uniform, and Cap America does good too. So it's up to you, they do cost 750 crystals, but imo it's worth it."

I know the primary team doesn't have much synergy, it just has the highest level heroes i have right now. Rocket has actually been very good at 3 stars, and kills most combat bosses easily. I use him to kill doc ock in VS, and it works almost every time.   for the gear, I'm thinking recovery on Cap, poison on GG, and crit on Malekith maybe?"

I'm having a bit trouble to ranking them up since finding bios is so much hard. Beside that i'm strugling with collecting ronan's bios. I really want him so bad but what i can do is just doing the first and second level on the special mission. Also i'm having trouble with energy and the 10 times available when doing tge special mission. Can you guys give me some help? Thank you"
FutureFight,3clz4s,TheDessertFoxx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:40:58 2015 UTC,"Farm 3 characters elite stages per day. 4 max. beyond that its too much energy and youll be sacrificing elsewhere.  Use special stages to power level characters as you get bios while you do it.  Get one team to max level first and foremost.  theyll be your arena team and one of them can power level your other guys in special stages.  For special gear, farm several dodge ones from iron fist. they help IMMENSELY with survivability.  Crit damage (captain america) ones are good for high volume attackers like angela, war machine, or gamora.  Crit ones (black panther) are good for high burst attackers like malekith or vision. Dodge Ignore is okay but i would just use a dodge % one on the same character and their survivability boost would even the misses out. get one cold (Loki) for loki, one poison(destroyer) for GG, one fire (GR) for red hulk, and two lightning (Thor) for thor and nebula.  after that dont bother with any of their stages again.  Buy Vision's uniform and then whoever else you use. Cap A's is VERY good if you use him, War Machine's lets him stun, and black widow's adds some great bonuses as well.  Beyond vision's though i don't really think any are worth the price unless they are for one of your main characters."
FutureFight,3cjt7m,driggs333,6,Wed Jul 8 13:44:55 2015 UTC,Strong seems to be a basic attack boost.  Healing is a recovery rate boost.  Teleport is immunity to movement debuffs.  Flame is immunity to fire resist reduction (Rider Rift).  Magic is immunity to silence (BP Rift).

So half of VS is not practically safe to do in autoplay. And you shouldnt br using more than 1 main hero for VS unless its a crap character used to tag and take a hit since having more than 1 main hero just wastes the 2 min potential. Overall, even having autoplay in VS is not really worth it as VS doesnt really take that long to complete unlike other missions."
FutureFight,3ciiz6,OxideRenegade,12,Wed Jul 8 04:27:16 2015 UTC,I really hope they get a new villain in here they can give plotlines to. I am hoping for Zemo closer to Civil War because he runs modern Hydra in the comics and soon in the MCU pretty intensely and is behind just as much or more crap than Hydra. And with the movie based releases we should be getting a lot of phase 3 villains over time.
FutureFight,3ciiz6,SageofLogic,8,Wed Jul 8 04:31:17 2015 UTC,"True and Ulysses Klaw from Black Panther, or there is Crossbones also in Civil war. I honestly don't care, I'm just tired of the fact that they give a lesser villain and make him seem like he is so much more important, and has to be in every single damn storyline in the game."
FutureFight,3ciiz6,SageofLogic,9,Wed Jul 8 04:38:38 2015 UTC,Even armored Whiplash from back in Ironman 2 would be more fun than this. And the Extremis guy from 3 even. Heck Green Goblin is Norman Osborn he has plenty of evil plotlines to play around with.
FutureFight,3ciiz6,crash100200,11,Wed Jul 8 04:42:41 2015 UTC,Maybe they'll put him in villain siege so u can release your rage :D
FutureFight,3ciiz6,SageofLogic,5,Wed Jul 8 04:33:44 2015 UTC,oh god don't give them any ideas or they will make him the permanent last stage because everything ends with him
FutureFight,3ciiz6,crash100200,7,Wed Jul 8 04:43:13 2015 UTC,Honestly as long as he doesn't have lasers I wouldn't exactly mind if he replaced Oct...

FutureFight,3ciiz6,misho86,3,Wed Jul 8 06:18:47 2015 UTC,Honestly the energy barrier he gets as a boss sometimes could run down the clock on a lot of heroes pretty easily which could make him a pretty frustrating VS villain.
FutureFight,3ciiz6,Scar_Stream,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:01:27 2015 UTC,yeah thats why i dont want in VS this barrier will take so much time

FutureFight,3ciiz6,Scar_Stream,3,Wed Jul 8 12:19:05 2015 UTC,"He'd be pretty cool though he seems like the kind of character who'd exclusively be a boss fight and not someone recruitable.  Also Marvel clearly has plans for him in the movies, he's shown up in the credits of 3 movies now just to say ""hey guys still here"""
FutureFight,3ciiz6,telepathboy,2,Wed Jul 8 12:50:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, man. A boss fight sounds like an awesome idea. Like someone who's insanely strong and would require tons more grinding. Kinda like the Final Fantasy bosses."

FutureFight,3ciiz6,SageofLogic,6,Thu Jul 9 00:04:22 2015 UTC,While he is so not my favorite either I am trying to view it as a good thing. If every level had a hero I wanted I would be stretched pretty thin on my entries. I want the two new hero's but I also have  two more guardians to get to three stars and a 6 star Ronan would be amazing... Not to mention ulton being added as well. Not enough entries or energy to go around.

FutureFight,3ciiz6,tom641,3,Thu Jul 9 00:04:57 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they know he's an unpopular character so they don't mind throwing biometrics at us cause they know we'll slave away or pay for flashier characters.

FutureFight,3ciiz6,IKADIXA,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:20:37 2015 UTC,"They need to fix the aim of his first skill though.  And no matter how solid he is, his 2nd skill is a death sentence. Huge start up AND recovery time leaves you vulnerable for too long. I don't think there is any other skill that compares. It would be decent if it had instant start up.  Also, his 4th skill has an undeserved long cooldown. It's not any more powerful than many other beam skills out there.  But truth, he is usable thank goodness. That 3rd skill is carrying him right now."
FutureFight,3ciiz6,davidtcf,2,Wed Jul 8 20:20:41 2015 UTC,Why we don't have his rift already?
FutureFight,3ciiz6,Gpaint,3,Wed Jul 8 10:11:27 2015 UTC,MODOK 5 stars is insane strong with that Mind Beam..  u have no idea. Nothing to complain about as he's the main antagonist of this game. Have you even completed all the normal missions yet to find out?
FutureFight,3ciiz6,jns701,2,Wed Jul 8 06:32:39 2015 UTC,The game hasn't been out that long. I can't even begin to fathom how any of us could even begin to complain (rant) about anything they do related to content. Currently we're being showered with yet another update along with fixes and improvements. I love it all

FutureFight,3ciiz6,shotterken,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:07:01 2015 UTC,"Bio-covert his bios!  In the new lab you can build a bio-converter that will allow you to use up any two bios and covert them into one you want.  I haven't built it yet.  I am still upgrading/farming anti-matter, so I don't know which characters are available."
FutureFight,3ciiz6,cannonmax,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:27:58 2015 UTC,Apparently it's a random bio picked from a certain amount of characters.
FutureFight,3cku66,knightfire90,2,Wed Jul 8 18:16:45 2015 UTC,"Ant-Man bios are harder to get. You can get about 20 Giant-Man bios if you focus on him on Special each day, I know it because I recruited him yesterday and got some extra bios. So got for Ant-Man, you'll have him at 4-stars with the pack, ready to get the boosts from his alt."
FutureFight,3cku66,EdgarDom81539,2,Wed Jul 8 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"Ant-Man is harder to get so the bios give you a huge boost and Giant Man is super farmable so there's that. Giant Man is tied with Yellowjacket as my favorite of the new crop( I have everyone but Red Hulk) and is better than Ant-Man I think. He's a wrecking ball with 3 strong AoE attacks.  So it comes down to who you like more as a character and how much work do you want to put into the characters long term.  You could always get the Ant-Man pack and get him going while you farm Giant Man and between Daily achievement crystals, arena, and Stark's Stash if you have it, it should only take you a few weeks to save up enough crystals to by Giant Man's uniform just by itself and by that time you could easily rank him up pretty much as far as you want if you focus on him."
FutureFight,3cku66,driggs333,2,Wed Jul 8 18:35:13 2015 UTC,Giant Man is easy to farm... i can clear the level in under 1min:20secs on auto and you can get 2 bios (1 from level and 1 from shifter(RNG))  so yeah.. you can get a lot of Giant Man bios fairly quickly.  Ant-man is via shifting only so he's a better bet to buy
FutureFight,3cku66,ithium,2,Wed Jul 8 20:35:04 2015 UTC,"I just picked up the Ant-Man bundle and I find him to be pretty great. His uniform looks better than the one you get with the character, in my opinion. His third skill and the uniform passive works amazing together. He's fast and small and can shrink his opponents dealing extra damage to them. Got him to level 23 only so far, but probably the most entertaining character to watch Auto-Play one with haha."
FutureFight,3cku66,SlyKoopa,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:50:44 2015 UTC,"I'm going to get the Ant-man one, and depending on the time they are available, might go for the Goliath one down the road. In terms of comic book heroe, I prefer ant-man and his attacks look cooler to me. Also, he's a speed character, and I have way too many Combat ones"
FutureFight,3cku66,Jplato09,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:18:30 2015 UTC,thanks im going to get ant man and then once if got yellowjacket to 4star i will get giant man to 4 star
FutureFight,3cku66,Blitqz21l,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:55:21 2015 UTC,"ant-man is the obvious choice because of the rarity.  However, if you think outside the box, getting 150 bios will basically get you a 4* hero.  Realistically though, with concentrated farming, you could probably get 150 GM bios in 5 days if you can do the rank 5."

Most of us were forced to accept the deranged version of F2P because of greedy mobile developers: that a game must have paying customers at all times and we must force them to be one. When in actual fact, F2P should be about keeping as many players as you can to the game while continue to churn content and offers out. When the offer is attractive like what we have here in future fight (where you can farm it but OH LOOK flash sale mhm) and players have a choice to choose they will spend automatically. Look around you, how many free players have already made their first purchase ever with this game when they even though they dont usually spend in mobile games previously.

FutureFight,3ckzvh,BlameReborn,6,Wed Jul 8 18:55:03 2015 UTC,"Giant Man: One man wrecking ball. Does great damage and his first three skills are strong AoE.  Good passive and with uniform you're practically always buffed. Decent leadership +5% hp.  Really fun to play with my favorite of the new characters tied with Yellowjack. Red Hulk is the only one I don't have.  Ant-Man: Pretty solid speed character and pure fun to play with. Between shrinking yourself and the enemies really fun to watch.  Pretty hard hitting skills the especially like the second and third.  Just like Giant Man with the passive and uniform you're running at an almost constant buff. Decent leadership with all speed can't remember how much exactly to start.  Yellowjacket: Super badass looking. Really fast basic attack. Second attack hits super hard and the first is a decent mob clearer, only have him two stars.  Great leadership with 5% chance to paralyze the enemy for 2 sec and applies to all as all the new leaderships do.  All three of them have native hp on their gears.  Wasp: Only have her two stars and she seems pretty decent so far but with some work could be great.  Ok basic attack, first skill is a hard hitting kick and the second a good blast combo with a mob clearing hit at the end.  Her third skill is a buff/debuff which is disappointing but it looks promising. I think she may be a dark horse that only really shines with some investment."

For instance, I make sure I run arena 10 times, do the last 5 bonus missions, run all the villain sieges, run the three War Machine biometric elite missions, running 10 Yellowjacket special missions, and finally with whatever else I have left over, I'm working on improving individual character gear from 5 to 9, which is also allowing me to rank up my anti-matter generator.  That last task will change the moment they start the reduced energy elite missions again.   I'm Shield level 50, and energy feels like a scarce commodity now, so having this task list keeps me sane!"
FutureFight,3ckumm,tjtoed,2,Thu Jul 9 05:25:11 2015 UTC,OMG I love you! well not really lol. but I have been dealing with the same thing. I am already an indecisive person and now that there's so much content then before my OCD is going through the roof trying to figure out a new pattern of what to do and who I want to focus on for my 3 teams and so on.
FutureFight,3ckumm,skyzvengeance,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:37:09 2015 UTC,yes... there is a ton to do...  I am just trying to hit a bit of everything but focusing mainly on getting our Alliance stuff done along with my achievements.  Any leftover I split between elite/normal and dimension rifts.  Not doing too many specials yet to wait and see how the new toons shake out.
FutureFight,3ckumm,Jplato09,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:21:54 2015 UTC,Yeah this update forced me to start buying a lot of energy.  Not gunna be able to keep up this pace for long so going to need to focus on keeping a balanced spread between everything you just listed.
FutureFight,3ckumm,ssj4ric,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:22:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, it used to be: daily achievements, farming elites, farming VS, farming specials. Now I can't just dump leftover energy into getting 2 or 3 extra biometrics from elites of characters I don't use a lot, because you need more Normal missions or Daily or wtv missions.  It's more fun for me, gets me a chance to get better at managing resources"

I was in a good groove before the update where I'd do all the daily achievements and then farm for a bunch of biometrics.  Now with the addition of the Lab, I feel like it's added a bunch of new tasks.  So I'm having a hard time picking what to let go."

As in, you can still farm and upgrade those Lab stuff but it won't really benefit you at all compared to just using the time and gold playing regular missions. I'm not being completely offbase here, Dimension Shop is only really worth it if it does offer those X100 Biometrics albeit at a slightly inflated price, Dimension Converter has even more RNG compared to Elite/Special/Dimension rifts in terms of farming bios and the Dimension Warp is also pretty meh.  Honestly, if your OCD is about collecting the lab stuff then I can't help you cause no matter how bad these things are you probably still want em. But if not, then I think that's the best way to think about it."

FutureFight,3ckrul,Blitqz21l,2,Wed Jul 8 20:33:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I just sell a ton of my 1* iso's.  I try to keep around 15ish in each catagory, just in case, but outside that, they are useless.  Too expensive to use on higher starred ISO's for very little return on your investment.  But I keep some around for when I get a toon to 40.  Once they are 40, I'll spend the money to get them a good ISO set bonus, and fill it with 3* and then if I can't fill them bonus up with 3's, I'll drop 1's in there to get the bonus and fill them with 3's as I get them.  I might even use those 1's and enhance them and combine them to get some quests done  here and there too.  1* combines are cheap and will definitely help you get those better ISO quest rewards.  Pro-tip though, if you are working towards the enhance ISO quests, do them 1 at a time, while time consuming, you only get credit for 1 enhance whether you put in 1 or 5, thus might as well do 1 at a time."

Toss in a Drax leadership and a shield iso set and there is no one he can't kill......  But it will take FOREVER. Movement and attack speed are likely the worst in the game and his basic attack is very, very easily avoidable. Skills are solid though, not crazy gamechangers but they can put a hurt on. Stack as much cooldown as you can (including Drax team up) and you have another god-tier character (he just requires more effort than the Visions and Spideys of the world)."

Just to give something objective, today I soloed stage 8 Bullseye with my level 45 mastery 3 Groot (and not full gear yet, damn dimensional fragments wall).

You can get an instant update by paying 100 crystal.  Edit: As you power up the Dimension Shop it unlocks one more spot for an item. Getting to level 2 for it is 7,100 Anti-Matter."

FutureFight,3cj7xz,sjohns0624,2,Wed Jul 8 09:51:05 2015 UTC,"A fellow Alliance member has the converter unlocked. By his description at lv 1 you get 5 conversions a day, you pay 2x Biometrics + 200 Anti matter in exchange for 1 random biometric (not sure if it is from a selection of 5 though).  Levelling the converter up only gives more uses a day.  So yeah converter for me is way too expensive for randomness.  200 Anti Matter + 1 Bio for 1 random bio maybe, or 200 anti matter + 2 bio for 1 specific bio is also ok. But its current form is just too expensive for me and wont be getting made or upgraded."
FutureFight,3cj7xz,MacStabby,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:24:51 2015 UTC,"Close, you get a list of 5 bios. The list updates every 4 hours. You select 2 bios you don't want plus 200 anti-matter and you get one of the 5 bios in the list. You can do this twice a day at level 1, x3 at level 2, etc...

Trading in 2 bios for 1 random one that you can't choose within a limit of 5 choices per day is just dumb. On top of the 2 day limit for starting out. How about we get to actually pick what bios we want? If they're rare, just make the trade in value more. Like 8 for 1 for a HulkBuster instead of 2 for 1 with an Iron Man bio. Something like that. It's just an awful and almost pointless addition. Did you see the comments with everyone being so excited for a Biometric Converter and now look. At least give us the ability to choose!"

FutureFight,3cj4q5,skyzvengeance,2,Wed Jul 8 08:58:19 2015 UTC,The daily limit of 2 means you can only do this once i assume?  Do other bios traded in give different offers?

So I can make another 2 bios for 1 trade once more. But limited to the list in the picture. Although it's a daily reset, so it might give another rotation tomorrow, but let's see."

So maybei clicked it in time or something before it expired im not sure. but i got 170 energy from pretending to be Japanese lol.

FutureFight,3chuz7,cy27,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:20:03 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if the Red Hulk is included as part of the Ant-Man hero chest or is he only available via the tokens right now?
FutureFight,3chuz7,hoju83,4,Wed Jul 8 01:46:41 2015 UTC,"I read Netmarble website, it said  ""If you purchase this item you will get a chance to recruit a random hero from the 5 new Ant-Man heroes immediately. After the purchase 10 Lv.4 EXP Chips will be sent to your inbox.""  So I guess you can get Red Hulk as well as other 4 characters.

FutureFight,3cj055,SakataKintoki,3,Wed Jul 8 07:50:36 2015 UTC,Personally...I wouldn't buy a uniform for 750 crystals unless I used him on a main team. Adding a uniform on him at that level isn't going to make the slightest difference in comparison to ranking him up and maxing his level. Either way he's beast with or without it
FutureFight,3cj055,Gpaint,2,Wed Jul 8 08:41:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with Gpaint. Limited or not, if you're not gonna be using that character in your main team then you would not be maximizing your crystals worth if you're just gonna use him for things like VS or minor farming. Get uniforms for characters that you absolutely like and use often (provided that they have a uniform now, but be patient as I have faith that Netmarble will eventually have many uniforms for all characters)."
FutureFight,3cj055,Zephyraine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:02:17 2015 UTC,"imo, he's the strongest blast character after vision, the uniform gives his 1st skill a 2 second stun ability, great for 1 on 1 matches."

FutureFight,3cijco,telepathboy,8,Wed Jul 8 04:31:03 2015 UTC,I think it would be pretty off putting to free to play players. It is already energy intensive enough to do 10 missions plus the 2 No limits. If you had 20 missions and 4 no limits you are talking about probably an easy 360 energy per day on that alone. Not a problem if you are willing to pay but I think they are smartly treading the line between encouraging purchases and discouraging non paying players.
FutureFight,3cijco,jcmatteson,2,Wed Jul 8 04:47:25 2015 UTC,Hrmmm. Maybe it's just because my computer is down and I'm spending a lot more time on this game...
FutureFight,3cijco,Zephyraine,2,Wed Jul 8 05:16:11 2015 UTC,You can play this game on your computer too. It probably helps save your phone/tablet's battery too by not needing to charge as often due to playing this game.
FutureFight,3cijco,seaball,4,Wed Jul 8 06:47:16 2015 UTC,"I feel the same. I remember reading a post said they're suppose to be separated (probably I read wrong then)  Tbh I think it's okay to share 10 between 2special mission(gotg and ant man), but that it'd get tougher if there are more"
FutureFight,3cijco,HiImRobertPaulson,3,Wed Jul 8 06:10:30 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it be the same as before the update?
FutureFight,3cijco,CountHalphas,4,Wed Jul 8 04:32:33 2015 UTC,I think what he is trying to say is why does the GotG special mission and the Ant-man special mission both share the 10/10 chances of entry to a special mission level instead of having a 10/10 for GotG and a separate 10/10 for Ant-man.
FutureFight,3cijco,Sqube,2,Wed Jul 8 04:43:22 2015 UTC,"It's not ideal, but it just requires a little bit of advance planning. I get all of the missions I want to biometrics for to no limit, then go after them the following day.  Then again, I might just be a filthy casual."

FutureFight,3ciqy5,Syllogistic_Panda,2,Wed Jul 8 05:52:17 2015 UTC,"Tested it with Wasp's blind debuff skill, it seems to just add a chance for them to miss. Its probably different from dodge, because the word ""dodge"" appears when you dodge, and the word ""miss"" appears over the blinded opponent, negating damage, like how dodge does. I wonder if its just separate factors factoring in.  Anyways, just wanted to know because I'm playing with the idea of a dodge build with Wasp, since using both high dodge rate and the blind debuff would make her very evasive. Plus with a cooldown skill reduction team, you can probably keep blind on for most of the time."
FutureFight,3ciqy5,CountHalphas,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:50:47 2015 UTC,Probably won't be able to attack with normal hits. The opposite of silence.

FutureFight,3ciqy5,SageofLogic,2,Wed Jul 8 07:07:59 2015 UTC,Wasp has a silence on her passive. The blind is on her second skill and a stun on her first.

Not to mention, Racoon is just damn hilarious and I love Punishers take on being a vigilante, but that's just me. :P  I'm keeping Star-Lord lead for now, but maybe after I finish bringing up Punisher, I'll put him in for a universal buff. Put Star-Lord in here and there when I want to hit massively hard with him and Racoon."

I'm not saying I don't care about Unions at all, I'm simply saying showing off how good the one your in is worthless.

FutureFight,3cj45o,Zephyraine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:55:38 2015 UTC,"Exactly - and the fact that it's just that, a union with 30 players, makes this kind of post all the more unnecessary. You get a hero to 6 stars, you share your excitement with the community. You level up your union and you can share that with your union members, there's no need to post every time your union levels up."

His first attack is beautiful looking, second attack is really fast, it stuns for 3 sec, and does decent damage, and his third seems to kill enemies 5 levels higher in one shot, and all three have great breaks. I am Really pleased with him. He has an amazing team bonus with Hulkbuster and Hulk, plus they all strike for each other. Since his skill attacks are all fire damage you can throw one of those fire boosters in his special gear slot. It is a great boost. He seems to be faster then Reg. Hulk but it might just be me.

FutureFight,3chn8k,SageofLogic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:14:53 2015 UTC,Yeah the special chests function more like Hero chests than Dimension chests (where it can be bios or heroes instead of just heroes and 8 bios if you have the hero)
FutureFight,3chn8k,tom641,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:20:38 2015 UTC,"I think they changed it so pulling a character from a chest gives you 8 times whatever rank the character is, but yeah if you're unlocking them for the first time then it's always best to do chest first."
FutureFight,3chn8k,SageofLogic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:22:35 2015 UTC,Oh wow well Hero Chests just got a whole lot better if that's true! Cause for a 3* character that's 24 and so on.
FutureFight,3chn8k,daman12457,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:39:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's 8 times whatever they start at.. so if they start off at 1 star you get 8, and if you level it to 6 stars, you still only get 8"
FutureFight,3chn8k,SageofLogic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:39:43 2015 UTC,"Oh boo that's not as good. Though still getting 24 Angela bios if you get her from a chest instead of 8 is an improvement. 16 for Red Hulk as well I guess, amongst others."
FutureFight,3chn8k,SageofLogic,2,Wed Jul 8 01:45:37 2015 UTC,"Wasp has a great leadership and a passive that can allow you to switch into a character with a great chain and spam it for a little bit (looks like the length of time will likely cut your first chain's cooldown so you can get the effect again on maybe the first skill or 2 of the second one) and she has some great team ups and strikers. Ant Man with his uniform is going to be a pretty brutal speed character, but not on the same level as Gamora or Spiderman. I can't tell you anything about the others because I don't have them yet, however Giant Man looks like he'll be pretty brutal in uniform too."
FutureFight,3chn8k,toysoldierxiii,2,Wed Jul 8 02:00:30 2015 UTC,"Hank looks absolutely monstrous - naturally high attack bumped an extra 30% most of the time in uniform. First three skills are all heavy movement, hard hitting AoEs.  He'll be the darkhorse of this batch while everyone focuses on Rulk's double+ damage (leader and special gear)."
FutureFight,3chn8k,Pathogen1991,2,Wed Jul 8 00:45:39 2015 UTC,"Add the team bonus with Ultron and Vision with 5* Ultron leadership and he's sitting at 55% atk boost and don't forget the 30% defense boost with uni, uni passive, and 4* passive  On top of that insane 3 team combo with AM GM and YJ he's a beast"
FutureFight,3chn8k,Futuretazz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:29:09 2015 UTC,Anyone unlocked Yellowjacket yet?  I'm looking at his leadership ability and it applies to all team members. Paralyze for 2 seconds?  I'm guessing it's a paralyze on your opponent?

FutureFight,3cij7f,idkmybffljill,2,Wed Jul 8 04:29:36 2015 UTC,You get a 1 star Wasp with 10 biometrics toward the next rank. So when you recruit her it will display 10/20.
FutureFight,3chj9c,Jplato09,5,Tue Jul 7 23:22:54 2015 UTC,You can't unfortunatelly farm loki:(. He's the boss but you can t get his bios from him. Giant Man bios are dropping
FutureFight,3chj9c,dann511,3,Tue Jul 7 23:37:16 2015 UTC,"The same is happening to me in the last boss... You fight Ultron and Modok, but I'm getting Ant-Man bios. This isn't bad, but I wish we could get Loki bios..."
FutureFight,3chj9c,dann511,2,Tue Jul 7 23:41:44 2015 UTC,"You got normal Ant Man bios, or just the first clear reward was Ant Man?"
FutureFight,3chj9c,Ejr2157,2,Tue Jul 7 23:44:41 2015 UTC,"first clear reward, normally you get modok, ultron or both, i got modok in my first completion (of course, he is everywhere)"
FutureFight,3chj9c,Zephyraine,2,Tue Jul 7 23:52:46 2015 UTC,"First clear, so you only get 5 ant-man bios for certain, for completing every level of that chapter"
FutureFight,3chj9c,Zephyraine,2,Wed Jul 8 00:10:12 2015 UTC,But you can easily get 20 over bios for ant man if you do the Yellow JAcket stage. He appears at a 100% Ally Shifter rate for me. So I get Yellow Jacket + Ant Man consistently for the 4th special mission.
FutureFight,3chj9c,Drayco21,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:05:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you don't always get the bios for the shifters in the new Special missions. I got 8 wasp shifters and 4 ant-man shifters and I only got 2 bios each."
FutureFight,3chj9c,xDave9teen,2,Wed Jul 8 01:08:58 2015 UTC,"RNG i guess. So far out of the roughly 15 runs, I got 12 Ant man bios from the Yellow Jacket stage. My day for ant man perhaps."
FutureFight,3chj9c,emceegyver,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:17:12 2015 UTC,Maybe I will get one of those. I did 17 runs total for Yellojacket and got 8 of his biometrics and 2 of antman's.
FutureFight,3chj9c,xDave9teen,3,Wed Jul 8 01:19:03 2015 UTC,"Ultron is my main, so I'm pretty happy about this."
FutureFight,3chj9c,emceegyver,2,Tue Jul 7 23:25:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it went from ~10+ bios a day to ~30 easily haha"
FutureFight,3chj9c,xDave9teen,0,Tue Jul 7 23:51:20 2015 UTC,"How so?  He was in the chaos marks before which you could theoretically get a guaranteed 9 bios from if you can do all the villain siege. The special missions give 10 CHANCES plus the ""unlimited"" timer. I can see the potential being higher with the special missions, especially for lower level people. I don't see it being that drastic though to say it's ""easily"" gone to 30 from 10.  As a lower level player who uses Ultron, I still like the change."
FutureFight,3chj9c,dee_jay8,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:46:23 2015 UTC,"You get 5 chances -> unlimited -> 5 chances -> unlimited.

His first attack is beautiful looking, second attack is really fast and does decent damage +stun/3sec, and his third seems to kill enemies 5 levels higher in one shot, and all three have great breaks. I am Really pleased with him. He has an amazing team bonus with Hulkbuster and Hulk, plus they all strike for each other. Since his skill attacks are all fire damage you can throw one of those fire boosters in his special gear slot. It is a great boost. He seems to be faster then Reg. Hulk but it might just be me. He's worth spending the Tokens on. :D  Ps. Have posted this in other related threads, I know."

Her status conditions are gonna be great against Doc Ock in VS to keep him off your back while dodging lasers. Giant Man and Red Hulk are gonna SMASH the Destroyer and Yellowjacket will also be good against Ock as well as Bullseye most likely.

Edit: I also think they should reduce the cooldown on the hero team up skill if the team is made out of 2 heroes. I think it should be something like 90 sec.    Edit 2: I would also like the option to see a certain hero's available teams by filtering them for a specific hero. I don't like going through all the teams everytime I want to create a new team.

FutureFight,3chwkd,Malekith24,3,Wed Jul 8 01:11:33 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on it so far:   The shield lab reminds me of Clash of Clans or Brave Frontier in terms of leveling up ""buildings"" or in this case, lab equipment for higher bonuses and gains. It also seems that max shield level has an incentive now outside of higher energy storage since it is now a requirement for upgrading equipment. The new characters are very nice, Wasp's lead boost 3 stats, Yellowjacket's lead gives everyone stuns, which at rank 6, becomes a 4 second stun when it triggers. Red Hulk with a proper build will wreck.  The new special stages are fun, avoiding giant mech mobs was more fun than it should have been. The new team bonuses are nice, Avengers! A... got a boost with a new Vision/War Machine. Personally was hoping for one with BP and Rocket though. :P Alliance seems decent, free stat boosts and more quests is always welcomed, though a chat system would have been nice too, outside the one filled with rift announcements and such. Overall, its another great update, its amazing how fast this game developed since launch with new characters and features, I almost feel spoiled. I cannot wait to see what they do for Capt. America Civil War, I'm sure that update will be amazing."
FutureFight,3chwkd,Syllogistic_Panda,3,Wed Jul 8 01:29:40 2015 UTC,There's a second tab in the chat panel for alliance. Far from perfect but you can avoid all the spam from the main one

FutureFight,3chwkd,Futuretazz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:28:42 2015 UTC,"The only thing that irks me about Wasp is how strong her leadership is, since it gives +6% to Speed among other boosts in comparison to Elektra and Black Cat's Leadership, which provide only +6% to Speed and nothing else. Just buff those two netmarble.  I am liking all of the new leaderships and abilities though."

FutureFight,3cii1a,exaslave,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:14:36 2015 UTC,Time or money... or time and money.  You can rank up several 3 stars by just doing daily elite runs for biometrics (and get biometrics from ally shifters too). Chaos tokens from villain siege and honor tokens from arena can also help on the side. The special missions allow you to get several biometrics on a single day if you have the energy and can kill fast enough too.  As for money you can buy crystals and wait for a good flash sale deal for a character. Stark's stash is a very good and cheap deal for crystals.
FutureFight,3cii1a,rhysappa12,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:47:18 2015 UTC,"Special missions are the best to get a large amount of bios, and a large amount of XP. You want to do level three until you can efficiently do level four."

My friend always got HB flash sale, so far, he got offered of 40 then 80 bios. His IR is 1 stars while HB is 3* right now It seems that the game will offer what you have already bought. I used to buy package Tony's Toys( 50 IM and 50 WM, still regret of buying it), then I just got offered it last week.

FutureFight,3cf3be,y2fitzy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:48:33 2015 UTC,"Most of these fixes alone would've made for a great update, Ant-Man content is just icing on the cake:  Hero Improvements:   Issue with abnormally low damage from Black Bolt's Electron Channeling skill was fixed. Issue with the Special Gear [Resist Device: Slow], did not work on the Anti-Gravity Field in Ronan's Special Mission has been resolved. Issue with Hero preview fixed.   Applies to the following heroes: Thor, Ultron, Loki, Destroyer, Ronan, Vision, War Machine, Malekith, M.O.D.O.K., Iron Man, Groot, Doctor Octopus, Luke Cage, Venom, Kingpin, Hulkbuster (Iron Man Mark 44)  Lagging issue caused by the Falcon's All-New Captain America uniform was fixed.   Bug fixes and game improvements:   The issue with Heroes going through Barriers in certain situation was fixed. A new downtown theme was added to Timeline battle. Villains' rank in Guardians of the Galaxy Special missions was adjusted.   Changes: All #4 stages (3 stars before adjustment > 4 stars)    All #5 stages (4 stars before adjustment > 5 stars)  Energy Recharge item image was improved. If you press a Hero's name on the idle screen you will be taken to the Hero page with all the information about the Hero. When you choose a Uniform on the Uniform page, there will be a banner in case if this Uniform is available through a Uniform pack. Reset time for Villain Siege will be shown in the bottom left corner instead of the top right corner. The explanation for the Reset time was added. Now you can check name of the Villain Siege Rewards. In the Daily mission 'The Madness in the light of Yellow #4' M.O.D.O.K.'s type was corrected from 'Combat' to 'Blast'. The issue with unusual functioning of Ultron's normal attack in case if he shows up as a Dimension Shifter was fixed. Background in Normal and Elite missions was improved to show diverse atmosphere of dawn, morning, afternoon, dusk and evening.  The issue with freezing of Sakaaran Ranger in Special mission #6 'Courting Death' was fixed.   Edit: damn, using Special mission #4 is going to get a lot harder now."

Then another Tony's Toys package (50 IM & 50 WM (still regret that I was lazy to play and want to level up quickly)). So I remembers I got same offer of Tony's Toys two days ago and 80 bios of IM in past few days. So like you said, I hope I can get 100 bios of HB sale.  btw, I also bought 100 Rocket raccoons"

FutureFight,3chw6v,Hardwayz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:08:27 2015 UTC,I got Wasp to rank 2 with tokens and she seems pretty decent so far.  She has a decent leadership and her two skills do pretty good damage and there's blind on the second one.  Don't know how effective her third skill.
FutureFight,3chw6v,driggs333,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:23:03 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/1Uvc9N5  I gotta say, he's really fun to play. His first attack is beautiful looking, second attack is really fast, it stuns for 3 sec. and does decent damage, and his third seems to kill enemies 5 levels higher in one shot, and all three have great breaks. I am Really pleased with him. He has an amazing team bonus with Hulkbuster and Hulk, plus they all strike for each other. Since his skill attacks are all fire damage you can throw one of those fire boosters in his special gear slot. It is a great boost. He seems to be faster then Reg. Hulk but it might just be me. He's worth spending the Tokens on. :D"

FutureFight,3chfpi,rikiking16,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:00:42 2015 UTC,"A lot of it is grinding. Let the game auto play itself. When you do that makes sure to play at lower levels than your current team as the AI isn't that great.  Use a good mob clearer as your leader character such as hulkbuster or destroyer.   Try to pick a team with synergy, either through striker bonuses or team bonuses. Example would be hulkbuster, iron man, and war machine. They give a team bonus and strike for each other. This bonus info is under the 'marvel universe' tab when you're looking at characters.  Best levels to grind are either special missions or daily missions.  Make sure to get your free chest and energy refills every 24 hours.   None of the characters you mentioned are neither considered really good or need a lot of investment to be good. This doesn't mean don't play them, if you like them go ahead, with enough tweaking and investment a lot of characters are great.   Two of the easiest characters to farm bios for and are really good would be war machine and spider man."
FutureFight,3chfpi,risinginthesky,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:01:48 2015 UTC,Can you tell me what farming is and how to do it?  I've heard Spider-Man twice now...
FutureFight,3chfpi,sephladaj,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:07:26 2015 UTC,"Farming just means playing the same levels multiple times for important resources such as bios for your favorite characters which you'll use rank up, norn stones for mastery, and the necessary normal missions for gear upgrade materials. You can find out which mission you need to play by going to the upgrade and clicking the material to find a list of suitable missions. Similar for BIOS and stones."
FutureFight,3chfpi,risinginthesky,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:56:30 2015 UTC,"Farming is when you devote your time to obtain a resource in a game. In this case character bios.   You can farm spiderman beginning at chapter 3 stage 6. War Machine is easier as he's the first character you can farm at chapter 1 stage 3.   Ultron and vision are also farmable in chapter 1. Ultron is the easiest of the two to farm for since he can also be found in the special missions. I recommend ultron though as he's an absolute beast.  Also focus on completing your daily achievements since that will net you free crystals. That combined with crystals you get as gifts or through arena you'll be able to save up for bios. If you have a few dollars to spare, Tony's stash is a really good deal, it gives like 2700 crystals spread out through a month."
FutureFight,3chfpi,risinginthesky,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:50:18 2015 UTC,Also a decent source of norn stones and gold early on would be the bonus missions.
FutureFight,3chfpi,Moozie76,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:53:48 2015 UTC,"ok, i am a noob, but this is what i do every day. I try to keep everyone at ""best condition"" which means I can't run more than 10 missions with them. not sure if the force close the app thing for reset still works.  first thing i do when i log in after the day resets is get my free chest, then start on the bonus missions. i use my black widow, she is lv 36 almost 4 stars, so she clears out the trash on auto and i put 2 people with her to earn xp, although the bonus missions don't give xp.  Then unless the daily mission is a red enemy, black widow plays 4 daily missions for isos. more for the weekly bonus. 4 missions a day for 6 days plus one on the last day gets your weekly quota done.  then i start farming bios in the elite missions. you can do each one 3 times a day, unless you pay crystals to reset. Now, if i have time i put in my captain marvel or ronan team so they can get xp, if not i just use clear tickets. I am currently farming war machine, vision, ultron, black widow (4 away from 4 star), venom, spidey. If i have excess stamina or stamina gifts or assembly points for stamina refills i will chase iron man or captain america and falcon.  once my stamina is done, i handle my arena fights, then villian siege.  after a couple hours my stamina will refill some, so I do my 5 normal missions to try to rank up the gear of my good characters. again if i have time i use one of my teams to get xp, if not clear tickets. I also reset the no limit on my ronan missions by doing 5 missions and getting 3 stars for later in the night.  before i go to be i run my unlimited ronan, and usually 5 more to reset it to no limit, but i usually don't have time to run a second one, so I grab my free refresh and burn my stamina running elite missions for norn stones or bios.  that is how i play every day."

FutureFight,3cfl2v,Hero_By_Proxy,4,Tue Jul 7 15:06:50 2015 UTC,"Heya,  Thaddeus Ross is more commonly known as General ''Thunderbolt'' Ross, who has already made 2 movie appearances in the MCU as the father of Betty Ross(the love interest of Bruce Banner) and the guy in charge of making the military's number one priority to capture the Hulk, so you can say he's the person responsible for Bruce Banner always being on the run.  I don't remember how he came to be Red Hulk, so maybe someone else can answer that.  Hope that helps a little and feel free to ask about any other heroes that I'm sure anyone here will be more than happy to provide more info."
FutureFight,3cfl2v,Rich_DR,4,Tue Jul 7 15:17:36 2015 UTC,"Thaddeus Ross absolutely HATE(S)(D) Hulk, he was supposed to lead a task force to take down the Hulk, failed, Banner took control of Hulk and was pardoned and that was supposed to be it. But he was still obsessed. He worked with The Leader and MODOK to take down Hulk, and the only way to do that was for him to become Red Hulk.  EDIT: he's also never been Venom or Ghost Rider, but he did lead the Thunderbolts at one time, with Venom and Ghost Rider (along with Deadpool, Elektra, Punisher and The Leader) as part of that team."

The reason he's known as Venom and Ghost Rider is because on one of the Venom runs by Rick Remender, X-23, Ghost Rider, Venom and Red Hulk fought against Blackheart who brought hell on Earth that time. So the 3 of them gave their powers to Red Hulk to make him powerful enough to beat Blackheart."

FutureFight,3cfl2v,Drayco21,4,Tue Jul 7 16:04:40 2015 UTC,"General Thunderbolt Ross was the army general who hated and hunted the Hulk. His hatred consumed him so thoroughly, he decided to release The Abomination on Washington in an attempt to kill Banner. Banner not only won, he trapped Ross in a pretty unwinnable situation- he basically had to own up to releasing Abomination and putting the American people he ostensibly served in harm's way and face justice for it, or he would have to kill himself.   He owned up to it, and was thus discharged from the military. Desperate, he fell into a sorry state. Then the Marvel Universe really went to hell- Superhuman Registration, Civil War, Steve Rogers assassinated, someone thinking Tony Stark would make a good director of SHIELD... ect. Desperate, Ross turned to the supervillain organization The Intelligencia to help him gain the power to ""save"" America, and they combined gamma rays with cosmic energy to turn him into the Red Hulk.   Red Hulk's base strength level was higher than Hulk's base, he retained all his intelligence and humanity during his transformation, he had custom weapons built for him so he could assassinate Abomination with them, and most dangerous of all, he could absorb radiation- which he used at one point to seemingly strip Banner of the Hulk. The main thing that allowed the green Hulk to beat him in the end was that unlike our Jade Jawed hero, Red Hulk does not get stronger when he gets madder- he gets hotter, and begins venting flames and radiation, so Hulk could keep getting stronger and stronger and eventually surpass his base level.   So anyways, Red Hulk gets made when the Intelligencia turns out to be the super villains everyone knew they were and betrayed him, tries to take matters into his own hands and then gets curbstomped by the real Hulk. He spent some time in a cell, before The Avengers recruited him onto the team, reasoning that at his core, General Ross is a good man with good intentions, who maybe just needs to remember what fighting for the good guys feels like.   The sticker? The world believes General Ross is dead, and he can't reveal himself, because he sort of tore Washington a new ass, blew up a Helicarrier and would get taken out for treason the second he revealed who he really was. So now he fights for the side of right... but everyone believes he's a monster, and the army actively hunts him, while his Avenger teammates are on constant watch around him because they haven't decided they can really trust him yet. Sound familiar? Because the irony sure isn't lost on him.   Most recently, Red Hulk formed a new team of Thunderbolts, including Elektra, Punisher, Deadpool, Agent Venom, The Leader, and Ghost Rider. He and Agent Venom get along really well because of their military background, and at one point, he used the venom symbiote and the Spirit of Vengeance during the Circle of Four mini-crossover in Remender's Venom book, which was awesome. During the second Marvel Now relaunch, Banner gained yet another Hulk identity, named Doc Green. Doc Green really wants to cure the world of Gamma Radiation and the monsters they create, and he seemingly depowered Ross.   TL;DR- Red Hulk is just old Hulk villain Thunderbolt Ross forced to become the exact same hero Hulk was when he hunted him."
FutureFight,3cfl2v,Drayco21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:16:36 2015 UTC,"Damn man, this comment was incredibly helpful. I want you to know I read all of it, but your tl;dr was spot-on.  How did you know all of this? Long time Marvel reader or do you have some good online sources to recommend? I find the Marvel Wikia to be extremely confusing at it hardly ever links me where I intend to go.  I have follow-up questions if you're willing -   What exactly is Marvel Now? I didn't know Rogers was assassinated but I knew he wasn't the only Cap America (something I'm still confused on) is there a resource you know of that contains a sort-of.. Marvel timeline with important events slotted in?   tl;dr huge thanks!"
FutureFight,3cfl2v,sjohns0624,4,Tue Jul 7 17:45:05 2015 UTC,"I'm just a long-time reader, but I always love opportunities to talk shop about comics, so I love filling people in. I do agree the Marvel Wiki can be pretty rough, especially if you don't already have a firm grip on the Marvel multiverse and start seeing stuff like (Earth-616) and (Earth-TRN517) tags all over stuff- I've tried helping out there, but I'm just not diligent enough to make much of a difference.   To answer your other questions;    Marvel Now was the name of the 2012 relaunch, where Marvel renumbered almost all of their books back to #1 and started a bunch of new books with new creative teams. It wasn't really an ""in-universe"" event, so much as a landmark in the real world to help as a timeline for stuff. There was a second wave of Marvel Now books the following year, where they restarted a couple (namely, Spider-Man going from Superior Spider-Man at the start of 2012 to a new Amazing Spider-Man), canceled a couple, and made a few new books. The upcoming All-New, All-Different Marvel that they're advertising all over right now is essentially just doing this a third time now.  There have been lots of Captain Americas- when Steve was originally frozen, the US tried at least two replacements (one of whom went crazy and became a recurring Cap villains) as propaganda pieces but they never caught on. During the Nixon years, Cap resigned and became a hero called Nomad, the man without a country, and he was replaced with a new Cap who would later go on to become the U. S. Agent, who's sort of like a more unhinged, violent Cap. When Cap died at the end of Civil War, Bucky  took over the role for a brief while, then Cap came back and reclaimed the Captain America name to rally the heroes together and defeat Norman Osborn and HAMMER during the Siege of Asgard. Most recently, Cap lost the Super Soldier Serum in a fight with a communist supervillain called The Nail, leaving him an old man not able to fight, so Falcon has taken up the shield as the current Captain America. Finally, timelines are hard for comic books because comics both do and don't move with the real world. Like, the Marvel Universe is always set the year the books are coming out, so Captain America has met Richard Nixon and Obama, and looked to be same age during both meetings. Peter Parker is in his mid twenties in 2015, but he also attended Midtown High in the 1970's. Punisher is a Vietnam veteran, but not aging a day. It's a sliding timeline, so you can't put dates on stuff or it falls apart in really weird ways. You can get a general guideline to the major events by looking at a list of major crossovers though; Wikipedia itself has a pretty handy one- that will at least highlight what the big, status quo changing events are."
FutureFight,3cfl2v,Drayco21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:18:25 2015 UTC,"Wow, great info again. Gotcha, Thanks!  One last question,  To start, an example: I've always been a fan of Carol Danvers. I heard she was known by Ms. Marvel/Cap Marvel so I picked up the newest Ms. Marvel only to learn it's Kamala Khan now (lol). While I have a firmer grasp of the Cap/Ms Marvel situation, my question is this: for my favorite heroes, is there really one point I need to start at to fully appreciate the intertwining stories or just read one I like and just read them as they go? I'm limited to Marvel Unlimited (haha) for the most part."
FutureFight,3cfl2v,Moozie76,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:35:51 2015 UTC,"Traditional advice is that you should follow creators/writers, not characters, because otherwise you end up like me, drinking your way through the Bendis Guardians of the Galaxy every issue and then lighting it on fire to be rid of it.   But of course, you need to read a lot to decide which creators you'd even want to follow, and there's always some level of wanting to read characters you have an affinity for. For that, MU is great because you can just pick a run, and go. Personal highlights for Ms. Marvel include Ms. Marvel (vol 2 on MU), Mighty Avengers (Vol 1) and New Avengers (Vol 2). I really dislike it, but the current run is just called ""Captain Marvel"" and it's written by Kelly Sue DeConnick. Usually when a book ties into a major event, they'll advertise it as loud as possible so you'll know, and you usually don't need to be following the main book. For Ms. Marvel's example, Civil War is a major element early on because it was a book that started in 2006/7 right around that event. As long as you know the basic premise of that event, you can just enjoy it as ""this is Ms. Marvel's vertical slice in the middle of this huge, huge saga going on around me"".   I would also say that one of the best things about Marvel (and DC) comics, is that there's never really going to be a full appreciation of them; there's always more to read. I always advise picking something you think looks interesting, and then jumping in wherever. When things from other books or past events are brought up, you usually don't /need/ them for the story itself, and they can point you in a direction to keep going and branching out to other books and events.  Hope this helps some!"

Ant-Man is one of the most seminal, important members of the Avengers. Hank Pym is one of the smartest, most influential beings in the Marvel Universe. Scott Lang has been an Avenger for decades.

We obviously know why Spider Man, hands down in the top 2 of the speed types. Now here's the tricking part. I like Black Widow because she has the range and paralysis attack, which is great when going up against bosses. Paralyze them, then boom run off a bunch of attacks (I only have her at 3's so  I don't have a third attack, but I could imagine how it would go with the third) Now Hawkeye, I like range if you couldn't tell, and I think Hawkeye would be perfect, his two moves (Again he's a 3, so I only have two attacks) sometimes cancels the opponents attacks, so boss fight, it's nice."

FutureFight,3cb9tw,ZimMalware,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:41:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, go back and try again.  No, the idea is to force quit if no ally shifter spawns, or if both an ally shifter and enemy shifter spawn and you figure you can't win that fight. The aim is to keep trying until you get an ally shifter and no enemy shifter, so you can clear the stage.  Of course, there is no need to use this trick if you feel you can clear the stage normally."
FutureFight,3cb9tw,tegeusCromis,4,Mon Jul 6 21:49:10 2015 UTC,"It says you can get the Ant-Man heroes in 5 chapters, yet one of the pictures says ""Special 9-1"". Interesting.

Without commenting on any specific feature, what I like most is the profit model NM seems to have chosen: not one driven by scarcity, in the hopes of forcing players to spend to progress, but one driven by lots of shiny things which we'll some of us will want to spend to get more out of. It's a huge improvement from the early days of global launch, when it looked like we would all be treading water graaaaadually getting our main heroes to 6* to unlock that final skill. Instead, the  ""end-game"" (if this trend continues) is going to be about unlocking and maxing a wide variety of new heroes, to add to our existing roster of maxed heroes. Because that's fun. I love it."

FutureFight,3cb9tw,SuperiorSpidy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:05:46 2015 UTC,That's not the classic Ant-Man costume. Looks closer to the Marvel Now Scott Lang costume than any other. Surprised the MCU costume isn't default like for every other character.
FutureFight,3cb9tw,Drayco21,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:53:23 2015 UTC,"well for iron man the default is the classic costume, the MCU version from AoU you have to buy so it's weird they have MCU costumes for every other avenger as default aside from iron man."
FutureFight,3cb9tw,MegaMohsi,2,Mon Jul 6 17:57:40 2015 UTC,"To be fair the classic costume is very close to a couple of his MCU suits. They probably used it to consolidate the looks for Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Avengers 1."

It will be possible to get Ant-Man Heroes and their biometrics through Dimension Chests and Hero Chests as well as through Elite missions.  ▣ Special missions improvements and new special missions  You will be able to easily enter Special missions by choosing the story you wish to play.  Meet the Guardians of the Galaxy (6 chapters) and the Ant-Man heroes (5 chapters) through Special missions! You can easily enter the desired story by pressing the thumbnail.  In the new Ant-Man Special missions you will have to thwart the evil plans of M.O.D.O.K. who intends to use Pym Particles that are capable of reducing or increasing scale of any form of matter.  The new Special missions will allow you to experience such phenomena as the increasing or decreasing your body size. Some chapters will also allow you to acquire Biometrics for the new characters.   Look at the buildings behind. Don't they resemble toy houses?   Meet new Dimension shifters in the new Special missions!  Generally you can meet Dimension Shifters only in Normal and Elite missions, but we decided to give you a chance to get extra rewards, sending Ant-Man heroes as Dimension shifters to newly added Special missions. They will show up in Ant-Man Special missions with a certain probability.  ※ There's no limit for Ant-Man Dimension shifters in Special missions, it doesn't affect the daily Dimension shifters limit.  ▣ Alliance system added  We are introducing a new Alliance system that allows you to form alliances with other players and get various benefits.  You can form an Alliance using a certain amount of gold and become its Leader. Members of the Alliance can grow through EXP that they get form clearing Alliance missions.  ※ Alliance EXP cannot be acquired when using Clear Tickets.   Alliance members will get different bonuses depending on the Alliance level. The higher the level of your Alliance, the better the bonus will be.   Try to grow your Alliance and make it more powerful!   After clearing the Alliance missions you will be able to get rewards through fulfilling achievements. ※ The reset time for the daily and weekly Alliance achievements will be specified in the Achievements window.  ▣ S.H.I.E.L.D. Lab added  In the S.H.I.E.L.D. Lab, by using Antimatter you can convert Biometrics, send heroes to missions etc.   To use all the machines in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Lab you will need Anti-Matter!   The Anti-Matter Generator will allow you to generate and store antimatter substances. Generated antimatter substances can be used to power the machines in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Lab as well build and upgrade them.  We will try our best to finish preparing this exciting update as soon as possible! When the exact date of the update will be determined we will be back with more detailed improvements guide!  Thank you!  Copy-pasted. Those ant-man levels look really nice so check the pictures when you can.   Also, the guy who wrote this announcement loooves his exclamation marks."

FutureFight,3cdrn5,ochocincohere,2,Tue Jul 7 03:05:31 2015 UTC,"well at 36+ i think you can start farming at lvl 40 special mission, exp is quite good and you can get/improve a hero in the process or you can do lvl 40 daily too the exp is good and you can improve your current hero in the process.  if you feel underwhelmed try to upgrade your team gears at least +9, normal and elite mission exp isn't that good IMO, spamming 7-12 is just too long and didn't bear much fruit compared to special mission and daily."
FutureFight,3cdrn5,Nueko,2,Tue Jul 7 03:12:22 2015 UTC,What this guy said. The level 40 and level 50 daily and special missions give a lot of experience. Also make sure to take advantage of bonus condition and use your exp chips
FutureFight,3cdrn5,eyeseeyoo,2,Tue Jul 7 03:14:39 2015 UTC,Daily Missions give good EXP?
FutureFight,3cdrn5,SageofLogic,2,Tue Jul 7 03:50:25 2015 UTC,Yeah. I exclusively level my 40+ characters on Daily #5 (level 52 enemies)
FutureFight,3cdrn5,eyeseeyoo,2,Tue Jul 7 03:55:06 2015 UTC,Do you just bring one under leveled character? I can't run anything over 45 with just one level 40 character.
FutureFight,3cdrn5,Augmentedforth,3,Tue Jul 7 04:31:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I usually bring 1 underleveled if I can. Sometimes I bring 3 level 40+s (e.g. against Level 52 Malekith). I run them to get better ISO-8. The leveling is an added benefit :-)
FutureFight,3cdrn5,eyeseeyoo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:45:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah for ISO missions and advancing the chapters, I use a full blown level 40 team. Usually my Journalistic Integrity team, just so I get the team move skill. I sometimes use my Malekith, Iron Man, & Captain Marvel team, all characters level 40 as well. I use the secondary team when playing against 40+ combat villain bosses."
FutureFight,3cdrn5,Augmentedforth,3,Tue Jul 7 05:05:34 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you don't have a lvl 40 Vision, then. :P I would suggest bringing one seriously underleveled character and one that is in the mid-30s. The mid-30s character may not achieve a ton (depending on who it is), but can at least be tagged in without getting 1-shotted and contribute a couple of skills to the rotation."

FutureFight,3cdrn5,SageofLogic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:55:56 2015 UTC,I feel it's the same for daily as for normal misisons. It's probably the fact that it's easy/fast fights with lvl 40 mobs and bosses. The normal fights at 40+ can start getting a bit nasty to carry 2 low characters thru but the daily one not so much.
FutureFight,3cdrn5,exaslave,2,Tue Jul 7 04:03:39 2015 UTC,"once you have a good runner at lvl 40 it gets a lot easier for everyone else, what i do is..  level 1-20 exp chips  level 20-40 any special mission 4"
FutureFight,3cdrn5,ign-Dextr0,2,Tue Jul 7 03:23:13 2015 UTC,wait special missions give you more exp?
FutureFight,3cdrn5,rikiking16,5,Tue Jul 7 03:42:05 2015 UTC,"They have a larger amount of mobs to kill thru and they're not hard at all. The exp you get depends on the mobs you kill and the boss itself, it's the quantity of mobs in the special missions that give you big gains."
FutureFight,3cdrn5,exaslave,3,Tue Jul 7 04:07:13 2015 UTC,They are probably the best source of exp in the game.

I'm no good with Javascript or Flash so I can't really make a web app, so spreadsheets are the best compromise.  What you're asking is possible, but it would be a lot more work.

FutureFight,3cdm7d,tiggeray2000,3,Tue Jul 7 02:52:21 2015 UTC,Clear tickets do not affect the shifter limit. Even after using tickets for about 30 elite missions I was able to later get my full complement of shifters through elite and normal missions several times in the last week.   It's probably just RNG but to me it seems like if I come back after a couple hours break the first few missions I play tend to get shifters. I also do most of my elites while working and have more time to devote to doing them which I'm sure helps my shifter count
FutureFight,3cdm7d,Malevolent_Web,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:44:46 2015 UTC,"What is the daily shifter limit? I generally use clear tickets at the end of the day if I think I'll fall asleep before I use all my accumulated energy, so I've never noticed. I also had no idea there was a shifter limit."

FutureFight,3cdm7d,darxide23,2,Tue Jul 7 02:48:28 2015 UTC,yup there was some debate after shifters implemented and it was confirmed my someone asking directly to netmarble's cs. i think limit is 20/day (assumed)
FutureFight,3cdm7d,Death_Keeper,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:53:50 2015 UTC,"I've never drawn the connection, but I notice this as well. I haven't been able to get more than 16 shifters in one day (and usually only 13-14) no matter how much work I put into it. I usually clear ticket my elite bio farm runs for the day since tickets will destroy breakables for extra bio chances and Auto+ does not.  Tomorrow I will try it without using any clear tickets and see if I can get 20 shifters."
FutureFight,3cdm7d,Thesparkone,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:14:01 2015 UTC,Clear tickets doesn't affect the limit or chances of shifters appearing its most likely the RNG messing with you on good days i can hit the 20 shifter limit in 1-2 hours of playing.

FutureFight,3caoen,v_iral,5,Mon Jul 6 13:46:26 2015 UTC,"So I looked at the official pre-release announcement that Netmarble made in Korean.   I have a feeling that the member cap will be 30 (at least initially). In the picture about union bonuses, there is ""2/30"", and below that, there is one union leader, and one normal union member.  The union info page is blocked off by the union bonus pop-up box, but that's my guess from what I can see.  We may have to make multiple reddit unions."

FutureFight,3caoen,Vermiuki,3,Mon Jul 6 14:39:13 2015 UTC,"From one of the other Redditors who speaks Korean, it looks like being in a Union won't require anything extraneous.   The Union levels up from the Exp gained by the members, so just by doing the regular missions you would do anyway you will be contributing to the Union. In addition, there seem to be Union Achievements; but they are also things like ""Complete 1500 Regular Missions"" etc.   I would love to see something like a Union Boss that is so strong it requires everyone in the Union to take a bit of its health away VS style, but currently there doesn't seem to be anything like that. Everything we do normally will be the same things we need to do to help our Union out."
FutureFight,3caoen,Youndu4You,2,Mon Jul 6 14:57:58 2015 UTC,"Actually... I take this back. They just added a post on the English forums detailing the upcoming update, and in it they specifically mention ""Alliance Missions"" are what you will need to do to gain Exp to level up your Alliance. Hopefully, these will NOT require energy to enter.  On a brighter note, however, the bonuses we get for a Lvl 20 Alliance are pretty nice."

There was an Ultron Prime boss you fought and win or lose you took from it's Alliance-wide HP pool, and then you could do other missions (that needed specific characters because, of course, it IS MPQ) to refresh the fight's cooldown to do it again and drain more health."

Any character to have his/her MCU movie is a guarantee (Dr. Strange/Inhumans, etc.)  I might get flak for this, but more than new characters I just want to see more diversity in hero classes, akin to Contest of Champions , tech/mystic/science etc.   It just makes sense and has more depth than making any hero the devs can't figure out automatically Universal.

FutureFight,3cbvjt,Spedwards,5,Tue Jul 7 07:27:23 2015 UTC,"shield level + rank/mastery of characters if that could be quantified into a number to rank you I think that would work.  For example: Shield level 50 nets you 50 points Shield level 49 nets you 49 points and so on  One toon 6 star gets you 6 points two toons 6 star gets you 2x6 points  One 5 star gets you 5 points and so on.   Master level 1 gives you 1 point, master level 2 gives you 2 points and so on.  Essentially assign a point value to rank, mastery and shield level and that is your point value.  It would be a good way to rank the level of activity I'd think... but maybe not.  I don't know how else you would assign a value here if that if how it's decided."
FutureFight,3cbvjt,telepathboy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:21:37 2015 UTC,"This sounds very promising. If we can do a point system for everyone, we can then quickly separate them into groups.    I think the main problem is that everyone wants to get into the top tier alliance regardless of how its divided. I myself has been in very reliant on clear tickets the past month or so because of work and a 2 week vacation out of the country. Because of this, my shield level (Lvl 44) doesn't really reflect my game activity. IMO, I could easily be lvl 50 by now if I didn't really count on CT so often. With that being said, I dont mind being placed in a union based on my level. To me, as long as the union bands together and work towards their goal, each of them will eventually be successful."

That way we could also elect/randomize (like a lottery) the 24 leaders of each ""sub-union"" and they would each be responsible for posting on here, coordinating members etc.   So for example, if each ""sub-union"" were to reserve 10 spots for new players, we could then have a way to shift players around if the leaders coordinate with one here. The only issue with that of course is first populating each ""sub-union"" initially so that the numbers are all even."

FutureFight,3cbvjt,tegeusCromis,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:11:08 2015 UTC,"If the preview is anything to go by, it shouldn't be necessary to spend any crystals to achieve the goals. Members will just need to prioritise their energy spending, e.g. setting aside enough for ~7 normal missions a day, in the case of the ""Power of Average"" (lol) achievement.  If it does turn out that the goals are unachieveable without crystal injections, then yeah, it could make sense to have some spenders pulling up each alliance. But as long as an F2P player can do it with proper energy rationing, it seems only fair to expect each member to pull their own weight."
FutureFight,3cbvjt,tegeusCromis,3,Mon Jul 6 19:22:52 2015 UTC,"Perhaps we should have the Alliances broken up into activity. There will be players who actually want a more casual Alliance, where they can go a day or two without checking in. They should also have a place to go without dragging down the rest of us who probably need a rehab program for Flash Sales and Energy consumption.  Have 4 Alliances divided up by how active a player is willing to be, and HEAVILY enforce this. Let players join whichever one they want.   For now, it doesn't seem to be any benefit to having an Alliance filled with high-level members as the rewards don't seem to have any difficulty tiering (at least not as far as we know). So, a very active SHIELD lvl 10 player who does tons of missions each day for the achievements will be just as useful to the Alliance as a SHIELD lvl 50."

FutureFight,3cbvjt,lnfidelity,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:50:59 2015 UTC,"Drawing on a post u/Infidelity made elsewhere: maybe level of activity? Some of the weekly achievements are fairly demanding (e.g. 1500 normal missions between max 30 members), and can't be hit without everyone pulling their weight. Other should be do-able even with a pretty low level of activity. It would make sense for players with similar goals to band together, else frustration is likely."
FutureFight,3cbvjt,drunklight,3,Mon Jul 6 19:06:19 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Since we cannot simply turn down users for trying to join the sub's unions based on sub activity, its hard to gauge how active they will be in the unions. I myself barely post on here but I check in multiple times a day.    I am hoping that there will be an option for the Leader to kick people out if/when they are are not pulling their weight. The same way I unfriend people who go inactive for more than 3 days straight."

What will be important is laying out goals and expectations beforehand. It would be unfair to less active members to kick them out without having informed them of the expected level of activity beforehand. On the flipside, it would be unfair to members looking to aggressively pursue the weekly goals if they were to find themselves in an undeclared casual alliance."

SEVERAL times a day; got to check the Flash Sales and get disappointed again there is no Malekith after all), then the people I have on my Friends List can as well.  But that does bring up an interesting point. Perhaps we are looking at the division all wrong. The way we might want to go is:  Reddit Alliance (SUPER Active)  Reddit Alliance (Active)  Reddit Alliance (Casual)  Reddit Alliance (Have a life)  That way the casual players can get into a casual Alliance without having to worry about dragging down a much more active one."

FutureFight,3cah0z,Spedwards,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:18:15 2015 UTC,"Your point seemed to be that the reason for a delay was that the actors in the movie would go on to record the foreign language version themselves after completing the filming. My point is that that doesn't happen. When I said almost, for all intents and purposes that can be interpreted as all.  Additionally, the time between filming finishing and a movies release is relatively long. For example, Age of Ultron wrapped in August last year. Plenty of time for the actors to record their foreign voice parts. If that was something that ever happened. Which it is not."
FutureFight,3cah0z,jcmatteson,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:27:31 2015 UTC,"From what Marvel movies I've seen in foreign languages (probably a total of 30 minutes in various clips), the majority of it was voiced by the original actor.  Nonetheless, whether it's the original actor or not, it's still going to take roughly the same amount of time (possibly more if they don't know the language)."
FutureFight,3cah0z,Spedwards,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:33:11 2015 UTC,That may be true for some languages I suppose. Just taking the Japanese example though I just checked the wikipedia pages and every single voice has been dubbed by a Japanese voice actor.   I realise that dubbing takes time but if the reason for the delay of nearly 3 months between the US release and the Japanese release was for dubbing then why did the film get released in so many other markets months earlier?

He can already hurt you, but ignore the enemy's ability to block that damage or evade that damage will guarantee that it hurts.  He's too slow to rely on something like crit procs, imo."

I'm getting bigger numbers but in the end I'll probably go ignore dodge and crit on gear.   I feel like most describe Ronan only based on his auto attack. He barely ever needs to use his auto attack so who cares? The rest of his skills can all hit many targets and often do so the opportunity for crits, etc, are constant.

New characters: Red Hulk, Ant-man, Giant-man, Wasp, Yellow Jacket You will get unlimited Ant-man related shifters in the Ant-man special missions. The number of shifters you get in the  Ant-man special missions does not affect your daily 20-shifters limit.

FutureFight,3cal6f,tom641,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:09:32 2015 UTC,epic Ultraman ish battle against Loki. I approve
FutureFight,3cal6f,ssquidinit,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:41:04 2015 UTC,Everyone's expecting Red Hulk to come from the Ant Man updates to the marvel games and I don't really see the relevance.
FutureFight,3cal6f,tom641,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:25:18 2015 UTC,"there were leaked pictures about a month ago of red hulk,enchantress,sandman and someone else i cant remember. the picture clearly wasnt fake as it was identical as the red hulk pic we have been officially shown. so its most likely those 4 characters are basically ready for release, enchantress would most likely be next as we have a special gear 'immune to charm' yet theres no charm tagged moves in the game yet. im guessing red hulk will be the daily logon reward."
FutureFight,3cal6f,gordonabishop,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:11:36 2015 UTC,"Ah okay. I was just wondering what Red Hulk had to do with Ant Man, but that might just be the devs picking someone they like or Marvel setting things up."
FutureFight,3cal6f,YanHoek,8,Tue Jul 7 11:58:40 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty real to me. Only thing that has me skeptic is there being 5 characters instead of 4, but hey, I'll take it! I'm also happy that they're keeping the GOTG missions (though I didn't think they'd remove them in the first place).  On an aesthetic note, Wasp's hairstyle is giving me life. Yaaaaas, Wasp! Slay me with that pixie cut."
FutureFight,3cal6f,chaoticheartld,6,Mon Jul 6 12:11:37 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! Been saving all my hero and chaos tokens for a week just in case... So Red Hulk and Giant-Man will be combat, I think a previous leak said Ant-Man would be speed. Yellowjacket for blaster presumably. Hoping Wasp will be a blaster... I've already got too many speeds who need levelling."
FutureFight,3cal6f,gordonabishop,2,Mon Jul 6 12:46:25 2015 UTC,"I can agree with your type list. A bit disappointing we don't get any new good Universals, but to be honest the list of good Universal characters is already pretty long. Also, I couldn't think of any Antman characters that fit the Universal type. At least now, though, I hopefully get two new options for Blasters on my Star-Lord C team."
FutureFight,3cal6f,chaoticheartld,2,Mon Jul 6 12:49:58 2015 UTC,there are too few blasters.  I have been saving my tokens for a while now too. though i am also curious who else will be in tokens besides new characters. Hoping for black panther

I also have a bunch of crystals saved up in case there's an option to buy them immediately like with the Guardians of the Galaxy. :) And yeah, I'm hoping for more Blast characters, too. So far Blast has proven to be my favorite type."

Antimatter is produced and used for the production and enhanced driving features of each machine.  This gives many agents as you expect, I'll try to be ready to launch as quickly as possible!  When the update is confirmed with the time schedule guide, we are going to add more detailed descriptions so expect much improvement.  Thank you."

The points can then be used to add bonuses to everyone in that Union. Excellent system.

They're just referring to the fact that the characters in that stage have (story-wise) increased in size using Pym particles or whatever. Sounds good to me, though this might mean the GotG specials won't be worth running by comparison. Don't see a downside."
FutureFight,3cc6t9,SuperiorSpidy,2,Mon Jul 6 19:58:26 2015 UTC,I think they meant to put special missions instead of elite. If i'm wrong then hallelujah for more elite/normal.
FutureFight,3cc6t9,Rich_DR,2,Mon Jul 6 20:38:38 2015 UTC,"I hope they add new Elite Missions, would make sense as that would expand the story. That was just referring to how the new Special Missions will be story driven by the Pym particles, so a nice touch. That will be awesome for farming the new heroes during the first week, I'm already pumped. I'm a bit neutral on the Alliance system until I see more of how it plays out."
FutureFight,3ccyly,DarthBlood,6,Mon Jul 6 23:06:39 2015 UTC,Comparing netmarble to any other company isn't fair though. I've played these kinds of phone games since rage of bahamut started and netmarble is far and away the most awesome and player friendly developer ever.
FutureFight,3ccyly,Sho1va,4,Mon Jul 6 23:46:58 2015 UTC,Dont worry bruh at least FOR NOW we can get 220 crystal every week in arena while you cant even get a premium crystal even if you camp that game for the whole day(CoC arena so BS )
FutureFight,3ccyly,knightzeemo,2,Mon Jul 6 23:15:21 2015 UTC,yea that's what i'm saying. for now.  give it some time and it might turn out like CoC
FutureFight,3ccyly,knightzeemo,2,Mon Jul 6 23:23:19 2015 UTC,I hope they wont turn evil o something. Netmarble is like a generous game god to me. I love them
FutureFight,3ccyly,xerxes3117,3,Tue Jul 7 00:13:14 2015 UTC,Had the same feeling .... alliance system in CoC is really f***ed up ... hopefully NM learns from their mistake

FutureFight,3ccyly,skyzvengeance,2,Tue Jul 7 09:30:22 2015 UTC,Only thing i'm worried about is being shield level 41 since i used to use so many clear tickets a day.  I feel the top unions here are all going to be level 50 requirement even tho i run way more than 7 normal missions a day which is the min amount everyone needs to contribute.
FutureFight,3ccyly,rhysappa12,3,Mon Jul 6 23:30:09 2015 UTC,"does shield level even matter? if i was a union leader, the only thing i'd care about is whether or not you're an active player.   also, from what i've seen in the update, it doesn't look like shield level plays a factor in any of the things you can do. except for maybe max energy, and the difference between lvl 41 and 50 isn't that big."
FutureFight,3ccyly,Jplato09,2,Tue Jul 7 00:31:08 2015 UTC,"The unions here are likely going to be split into groups of similar players, either by location or shield level. 41 is perfectly fine I'd say."
FutureFight,3ccyly,jhmallett,2,Tue Jul 7 00:09:51 2015 UTC,"I'm astronomically scared that this Union thing will turn out like CoC, but this game is nowhere as random and rage-inducing as that. I'm scared that it's gonna be really unbalanced... The concept seems good: spare some energy to do some quests for the union, to get rewards for all the members! But... Idk yet, no hopes"
FutureFight,3ccyly,Fo0lishDo0d,2,Mon Jul 6 23:31:27 2015 UTC,"I loved having teammates when I played BOTA, I never would have left if not for the battle schedule."
FutureFight,3ccyly,exaslave,2,Mon Jul 6 23:50:10 2015 UTC,I think Netmarble can do it correctly and fairly. Bare in mind you already have bonuses in arena and it IMHO does not matter all too much.
FutureFight,3ccyly,NgTurbo86,2,Tue Jul 7 03:13:30 2015 UTC,do we really? i thought team bonuses didn't count in arena?
FutureFight,3ccyly,Thesparkone,2,Tue Jul 7 03:40:53 2015 UTC,At the very least leadership counts. Also the bonuses for unlocked characters.  They do help a lot sometimes.
FutureFight,3cbwkj,the2ndfifth,5,Mon Jul 6 18:36:24 2015 UTC,Vip lvl 7. Way more then i would have liked. but worth it so far. like the content and new stuff they add to the game.

FutureFight,3cbu0o,BrainWav,3,Mon Jul 6 19:21:33 2015 UTC,1.) Black Panther is Scheduled for November 2017 2.) Doctor Strange is a Huge character in the Marvel Universe (Larger than Malekith at the very least) 3.) Red Hulk was Released with nothing to do with Ant Man 4.) There is going to be 10 months between now and Civil War so there will be many updates in that time which gives ample time for them to Release him.
FutureFight,3cbu0o,OxideRenegade,2,Mon Jul 6 20:01:07 2015 UTC,"Actually, Black Panther was pushed back to 2018 because of the Spider-Man movie that is now coming in 2017.

I wonder if OP just leveled whoever was in Best Condition, or if he had some serious routine that involved getting up at a certain time to spend a certain amount of Energy which would refill after a certain calculated duration, at which he would be certainly waiting to level up his heroes to a certain point."

So I'm not going to waste a lot of energy and time trying to rank up characters that do perfectly good as they are.

FutureFight,3c8s0q,hou_f,2,Mon Jul 6 02:27:40 2015 UTC,Exactly this. Take the one you want with fodder for your fodder for tagging. Works well on most other than Doc
FutureFight,3c8s0q,v_iral,2,Mon Jul 6 02:39:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe I could do this later on, as right now most of my roster is level 20 or below.  My main team is Iron Mania just because it was the first 3 man team I could get together, then I have JI behind them, and I recently got Destroyer for Created ones but they're just above 20.

FutureFight,3c8s0q,hou_f,3,Mon Jul 6 03:19:48 2015 UTC,I think the tag breaks the targeting which is what causes the rocks to stop.  Even if you brought a level 1 fodder it'd be one free cancel and a few seconds on your mains cooldowns.
FutureFight,3c8s0q,v_iral,2,Mon Jul 6 07:00:32 2015 UTC,"Like what /u/crash100200 said. I usually save my not so strong speed characters for this.  Plus, especially in destroyer's stage, I get much more time to punch him by tag-cancelling the rocks than going solo. This is a measure for both defence and offence to me.  Tag-cancelling also applies to ock's lasers btw. But don't do it in front of bullseye."

FutureFight,3c8s0q,Keifru,3,Mon Jul 6 07:57:01 2015 UTC,I didn't know that I can cancel the falling rocks. I have to thank you. :)
FutureFight,3c8s0q,SageofLogic,4,Mon Jul 6 08:05:28 2015 UTC,"Oh haha glad it helps and you are most welcomed! I found this out in a very unpleasant scenario too.  Actually it's as /u/TrackXII 's saying tagging disengages the target lock on. So everything that's happenning at that moment would come to an end (please be careful that the falling rocks would fall for approximately 0.5 sec more and you may still get hit). This also applies to Ock's laser and all boss skills (but not Ronan's slow fields). This is how I manage to get through 9 stages of VS with relatively low level characters and very bad controlling skills.  But if you do this at wrong time in Bullseye's stage it would back fire. If the bots are armed and ready to blow and you tag, this will ALSO disengage their blows' lock on and they will start moving again and in the end wasting your time to run from them again."
FutureFight,3c8s0q,eyeseeyoo,2,Mon Jul 6 08:20:27 2015 UTC,"You said it before I could.  Using multiple characters to target boss-targeting allows for more DPS, and increased survivabilty. I use it for the following fights.   Ock Lasers, obv. Bullseye is doing the spinning attack and my circle is too tight to dodge them. Destroyer meteors, just because dodging them wastes A LOT of time. Destroyer's stun into explosion. The stun doesn't do anything, but the explosion can one-shot a lot of characters plus it wastes a lot of time. Accidentally starting an already slow skill inside of a slow field of Ronan's. He will kill off some off your squishier characters off most of the time.   I'm soloing the first six stages now, but the last three, I always roll three characters at a time and try to finish it off in 2 minutes."
FutureFight,3c90df,SageofLogic,4,Mon Jul 6 00:51:44 2015 UTC,"He hits really hard. I would compare him to a Luke Cage, little less tanky but can dish out more damage.   Heroes that have a buff/debuff as their 3* skill will only shine once you get that 5* skill so you can get decent chain going. Drax's 5* hits nice and hard and will half kill a Spider-man of a similar level. It also seems to have a better range than Luke Cage's ""sweet christmas"", so another point to Drax there.  Overall I like him. He is great in VS and decent in PvP. I am happy to put him up against most combat heroes on auto and he usually wins easily enough. If he can hit a speed type, he only needs a few shots to take them out."
FutureFight,3c90df,Zyraz-,3,Mon Jul 6 06:22:14 2015 UTC,That's pretty awesome. I do like that his buff is also a debuff and goes nicely with his passive when it activates. All stacked together it's a lot more useful than most other non-attacking skills.
FutureFight,3c90df,Zyraz-,3,Mon Jul 6 06:50:22 2015 UTC,It's also awesome that his buff is a % and not flat numbers. The shield also stops armour breaking attacks... and it debuffs! One of the better non-attacking 3* skills in the game.
FutureFight,3c90df,Gpaint,2,Mon Jul 6 07:23:44 2015 UTC,And it's not a tiny % either which is what makes it actually usable.
FutureFight,3c90df,Gpaint,2,Mon Jul 6 11:55:25 2015 UTC,I have mine at 3 and I am hoping he will be late bloomer. I found Ronan to be similar where he was underwhelming but after 5* he was a God. Drax seems like an excellent single target tank on paper. I too am interested in some late game opinions on him.
FutureFight,3c90df,Gpaint,2,Mon Jul 6 02:04:50 2015 UTC,He's decent at 4* but his 5* skill looks really good. AoE with a built in stun.
FutureFight,3c90df,Zephyraine,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:15:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Due to farming Ronan I think alot of us have not spent much time on all the rest yet hehe I assume reviews on higher level Yondu, Nebula, and Drax to follow in time"
FutureFight,3c90df,Justikyzer,2,Mon Jul 6 02:37:20 2015 UTC,Now that his Arrow Call is fixed and I have unlocked 3* and Arrow Barrage or whatever Yondu is looking like a really good ranged character. Especially with the possibilities of a Gamora leadership and Two Snipers team and some other interesting possibilities. Nebula is a really fantastic fast combat character and her lightning element attacks makes her a really good choice too.
FutureFight,3c90df,Angelshover,2,Mon Jul 6 02:41:28 2015 UTC,I just unlocked 3 star myself on him and that 3rd skill is what people were hoping for. Kind of like captains shield but with the arrow. Love it
FutureFight,3c90df,Angelshover,2,Mon Jul 6 02:43:12 2015 UTC,"When you say Chapter 8, do you mean Elite as well? I'm stuck at War Machine Elite 8. But I Have WM, HB, IM, Vision at 4 stars and alot of 3 stars. Not sure why I can't seem to beat the level though. I even went as far as having groot to help provide some heals but I can't seem to heal fast enough during the Boss Fight as I need to keep moving around."
FutureFight,3c90df,tobycch,2,Mon Jul 6 02:06:12 2015 UTC,"Not quite all the way there on Elite but it's not because my team is weak, it's cause pushing forward is a little exhausting mentally and in game energy intensive and the only bios I want from that chapter in Elite is Thor's."
FutureFight,3c8u2h,ssj4ric,2,Sun Jul 5 23:54:00 2015 UTC,My 5* Gamora can clear the level 40 levels for all the special missions in under 2 minutes so I have her carry 2 characters I am leveling through.  Gamora between about 100 bios from flash sales and consistent Honor tokens every day is pretty fast to rank up. My 4* Starlord from Chaos tokens can almost pull it off too.
FutureFight,3c8u2h,SageofLogic,3,Mon Jul 6 00:43:45 2015 UTC,I am so jealous. I have yet to see a decent flash sale for her. And Honor tokens are so much slower to come by than Chaos tokens. I have 25k Chaos tokens lying around with no one to spend it on.
FutureFight,3c8u2h,eyeseeyoo,2,Mon Jul 6 01:04:33 2015 UTC,I got Green Light and Deadly Duo (which is also how I got Angela) since GotG came out. And I'm guessing you have gotten Starlord to 5* already then? Because he's definitely worth it.
FutureFight,3c8u2h,SageofLogic,2,Mon Jul 6 01:09:31 2015 UTC,Nope on Starlord. I don't like his first two attacks and to me he's not worth using for his 3rd attack only. Especially when I have Vision Iron Man and War Machine all 5* blast heroes already.
FutureFight,3c8u2h,eyeseeyoo,2,Mon Jul 6 01:17:44 2015 UTC,"You can cancel out of the 3rd attack into the cannon for some really fun dodgy interactions and the 5* is really good too. But I respect that, fair enough. And yeah no one else in the Chaos shop is really worth it. Red Skull is farmable from Elites and just everyone else is meh."
FutureFight,3c8u2h,SageofLogic,2,Mon Jul 6 01:36:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think Ultron is meh. As for Red Skull, he's probably the worst chaos token hero. You pretty much get nothing from ranking him from 1 to 4-stars except stats. I would not even spend energy on his elite missions."
FutureFight,3c8u2h,tegeusCromis,2,Mon Jul 6 09:31:55 2015 UTC,I want to buy gamora bios but I'm just saving up till the next big update but I have 3* gamora so maybe I'll level her up since she's only at 28
FutureFight,3c8u2h,SageofLogic,4,Mon Jul 6 00:52:06 2015 UTC,She's definitely the best speed character in the game and probably in the top 10 or so overall.
FutureFight,3c8u2h,Thesparkone,2,Mon Jul 6 00:54:59 2015 UTC,Spidey is the best speed character.

FutureFight,3c8u2h,TheDessertFoxx,2,Mon Jul 6 19:12:37 2015 UTC,"I use my ronan (he's 5* lvl 40 but you could do it at 3* really) to carry two leveling characters through level four of whoever i am farming (nebula currently).  To clear I run past all mobs, gather the melees, drop them with his 3rd ability, go to the ranged mobs, step to the right angle for beam and let loose.  at this point just mop up either with ronan or a tag so he can heal and move on.  For the boss i have him sweep (break), beam and then AoE fear followed by auto attacks.  My normal run time is under 2 mins. i think my best was like 1:28 on ronan's stage.  For nebula it takes a bit longer because of her skill kit and stage design. still around 2 mins."
FutureFight,3c8u2h,TheDessertFoxx,3,Mon Jul 6 01:43:44 2015 UTC,What's your auto play strategy?
FutureFight,3c8u2h,ihavespeedforce,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:57:40 2015 UTC,i do all of the above on auto play. i really just move to position them away from the slow domes.  if the stage doesnt have any slow domes it knocks about 20 seconds off my time.
FutureFight,3c8u2h,menas0r,2,Mon Jul 6 19:41:21 2015 UTC,"Currently when farming Ronan I use a team of Ronan (Leader), Captain Marvel, and any random hero with best condition and switch to Captain Marvel at the beginning and just solo clear the mission with her. I have a specific pattern of how a path and use my skills through the mission so it never changes. I usually do the level 4 mission with a clear of around 1:05 but if I don't get a bio twice in a row I switch to level 5 which takes me around 1:50 ish."
FutureFight,3c8u2h,IrmaGoodness,2,Mon Jul 6 04:03:33 2015 UTC,"I use a 5* fully mastered Spiderman and I carry two others to level. For the Ronan level, it's semi auto. I just position Spiderman away from the slow towers and pull mobs so I can take them down with his swinging aoe. When farming Nebula and Yondu, I just leave it on auto and let him run.  Before I had 5* Spidey, I would take Venom with me as well (like someone else posted)"
FutureFight,3c8u2h,Angelshover,2,Mon Jul 6 04:27:53 2015 UTC,"When I was still farming Ronan I used either 4-star Ultron or 4-star Ronan plus any two characters who need leveling. Ultron was faster of course. I kept doing the 4th mission and averaged about 1:28 on Auto-Play, only interrupting to step out of slow fields and to speed up movement.   Someone posted a great tip about speeding things up for the second room, which is to wait for your character to lock on to a breakable item/box (you'll see white crosshairs), then press a melee skill so that the character runs towards it. Move away at the last second so that the skill doesn't actually get used and your character will keep running. You can do this twice in the second big room, first to get down the long corridor from the entrance, and then to run horizontally to the second open area where the enemies actually spawn.  I find the stun bots in Nebula and Groot's areas super annoying, so I just go full auto."

Personally I'm burned out from 5-starring Ronan so I've been spending energy on the other special missions, but it would be nice to 6-star him some distant day in the future."

I'd save up near 120 energy and pop the unlimited. I could get 18-19 run finished. I have a very specific route through the stage for Ultron if your interested, just PM me. It would get me through In a minute and 20 seconds."
FutureFight,3c8u2h,rhysappa12,2,Mon Jul 6 06:18:11 2015 UTC,I use 5 star Venom or 5 star Spidey on auto in Level 4 and try to cram as many extra team bonuses as I can make from my under levelled toons.    If I catch it I will press on any teamwork as well as push the toon all the way to the top of the Ronan stage (although both Parker and Brock have a tendency to skill themselves back into the field)

I do feel that clear tickets are better because they break everything especially if you auto play, which i do. They did do a minor patch though because you used to be able to get multiple shifter bios but that seems like its gone because it wasn't allowing you to get the bios of the elite level you were on. Never the less i guess it's up to you because you do risk out on missing shield points (unless you're level 50) and you miss out on shifters coming. So you just have to take into consideration all the factors. My recommendation would be get to level 50 shield so you dont have to worry about shield exp points, make sure you get your 20 shifters for the day on normal missions then go to town using clear tickets in elite misions for maximum money and bio drops."

FutureFight,3c72ud,darxide23,7,Tue Jul 7 21:50:35 2015 UTC,My only beef with Destroyer is that his movement speed is noticeably slower than most other heroes.  Even without promoting him past rank 3 he is still a fantastic character with a devastating 1-2-3 skill combo that is generally safe in most circumstances.
FutureFight,3c72ud,tegeusCromis,6,Sun Jul 5 15:47:15 2015 UTC,"This is probably going to repeat a lot that's been said on other threads, but I guess that can't be helped. My take: Destroyer is much better than was appreciated in the early days of the global launch. It's a markedly better hero than Ultron when it comes to really tough story or VS fights due to the extremely safe rotation. I subbed out Ultron from my CO team (for Ronan, obviously) and haven't regretted it. Have also been surprised to find I rarely tag in Vision these days. He's probably still the better hero, but Destroyer makes me feel like I have more control over the fight."
FutureFight,3c72ud,YakElitism,3,Sun Jul 5 14:27:20 2015 UTC,"In theory, I agree with everything you're saying and feel betrayed by Ultron and love Destroyer's skill chain, but I've found Ronan/Vision/Ultron gets me better results than R/V/D in tough story missions just because of Ultron's burst damage. He's worse than Destroyer, but he does fill a role for me, though I really wish I could just switch him out."
FutureFight,3c72ud,Ashy_Larry_1,2,Sun Jul 5 18:18:30 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same position. How are you planning on maxing him, if at all? I'm debating between Angel of Death, Spy Tactics or Hawk's Eye to take advantage of his gears, attacking and especially skill rotation"
FutureFight,3c72ud,tegeusCromis,2,Sun Jul 5 16:31:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not prioritising cooldown. In VS, I find the downtime acceptable; anyway, most boss stages--Ronan being the exception--follow a pattern where there are times you can't attack anyway, and have to run around. In story/daily/special, it's more efficient to just constantly tag between heroes, so I don't need the cooldown bonus. I chose to stick with a heal proc to give me a bit more margin for human error, but I'd have been equally happy with a +attack proc."
FutureFight,3c72ud,PorkBunGuy,2,Sun Jul 5 17:08:41 2015 UTC,"Tbh, visions density shift is glitchy after the fix. If only I have as much stars on destroyer, I will switch our ultron too despite not being a striker"
FutureFight,3c72ud,Lanceuppercut47,4,Sun Jul 5 14:41:52 2015 UTC,"Amazing when you get him to 5 star as you can chain 3,2,1,4 then 3,2,1 then repeat until the boss is dead.  I feel that his 5 star special has more range than Ultron and Vision with the added bonus of DoT.  I have spec'd mine for skill cooldown on gear 4, yet I have Bloodthirst on mine, where really it should be Angel of Death for the proc.  Though the shield gives me a bit of room for error or if the stun gets dodged, I should equip him with a ignore dodge to get round this problem.  I run the 5* version of him (54/320) with 5* Ronan and Vision. I think it will be hard to switch him out for a 6* Ultron when they all get to that level even if he is still 5* due to his super safe special chain.  I always save him for the last siege boss that isn't the Destroyer and can usually cause 50-75% damage before others have to step in."
FutureFight,3c72ud,Jellowpy,3,Sun Jul 5 22:12:46 2015 UTC,"One of the safest character to play because of his combo even in the higher lvl siege 7-9 .. If partnered with 2 disruptor characters like spidey, daredevil, venom (4star),Ronan and/or hulkbuster you can safely dish out continous skill chain from 1st character upto 3rd character then rinse and repeat till boss dies..  Only gripe i have with him is that i dont see his Biometrics on sale been waiting since launch =("
FutureFight,3c72ud,EdgarDom81539,3,Sun Jul 5 17:57:24 2015 UTC,"He has the makings of a top-tier hero, with easy breaks and stuns on his skills, also an energy damage inmunity and a leadership that reduces energy damage even more. He has one of the best combos in game, namely stun-rush-beam.The only problem is that his biometrics are hard to farm and his movement speed is too low. Other than that I highly enjoy using him against himself on VS, hehe"
FutureFight,3c72ud,af-fx-tion,3,Sun Jul 5 18:18:57 2015 UTC,"Even though his movement is slow, his 3rd attack with guaranteed stun is amazing for VS or Boss battles. Especially if you have his other skills leveled up."
FutureFight,3c72ud,sensai26,3,Sun Jul 5 21:04:58 2015 UTC,I only wish that his size and the explosions that are in VS would go with him when you use him. He is such a giant in VS.
FutureFight,3c72ud,ConcealedTerror,2,Mon Jul 6 03:33:29 2015 UTC,"how powerful is his 5* comparing to IM, Ultron, WM? I stopped bothering with him at 4* and switched my CO over to IM\Ultron\Uvision cause feels like IM is a much better choice compared to Destroyer"
FutureFight,3c72ud,Ashy_Larry_1,4,Sun Jul 5 20:13:09 2015 UTC,"Out of those guys I can only help you out with Ultron. I just ran Elite 8-5 3 times and only used their 5* skills. On mobs on average Ultron's dealt ~1800 damage and Destroyer's ~4000. It also deals additional fire damage over time but the mobs were dead so I couldn't tell what that was.     Ultron's energy attack is 4766, Destroyer's 3890 and skill levels are 24 and 18 respectively. I think his rank 5 skill is absolutely amazing. His entire skill set is so damn good"
FutureFight,3c72ud,ConcealedTerror,2,Sun Jul 5 20:43:49 2015 UTC,"Ultron damage comes out in 4-5 pulses and destroyers is a single one, so I think you forgot to multiply ultrons damage  cause my ultron oneshots mobs in ch 8 with his 5* except for those big machines"
FutureFight,3c72ud,Ashy_Larry_1,4,Sun Jul 5 21:10:17 2015 UTC,"Tried it again, mine doesn't.    Destroyer Ultron  The rule of the thread is to solely talk about Destroyer so I will stop here, apologies. Suffice to say I think his 5th skill is really good"
FutureFight,3c72ud,ConcealedTerror,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:32:22 2015 UTC,Right bottom corner is 1184+1158+1160=3502 damage and I think there is at least one more pulse
FutureFight,3c72ud,Ashy_Larry_1,5,Sun Jul 5 21:44:14 2015 UTC,"Totally. The end result though was they survived with Ultron but Destroyers added fire damage ended up taking them out, dealt about 680 per hit. Conclusion is they probably aren't very different. My Destroyer is very much under leveled compared to Ultron too, probably just boils down to preference and mine lies with Destroyer"
FutureFight,3c72ud,hou_f,2,Sun Jul 5 21:56:54 2015 UTC,"IM's leadership is amazing at 5*, and his damage and utility is finally acceptable.   WM's damage is over the roof at 5* (minigun barage = almost 2*missile barage), 1 round of skills deal over 20k damage to level 5 rift bosses without any attack buff/leadership, the uniform provide a good and fast stun too.  I would personally recommend WM for pure power but I also like IM for the fun."
FutureFight,3c72ud,neilliyo,2,Mon Jul 6 08:43:35 2015 UTC,"In CO team you can stun the enemy twice or even 3 times in a row if you count him striking for ultron, team up skill and his 3rd."
FutureFight,3c72ud,imjms737,2,Mon Jul 6 02:46:53 2015 UTC,"I have him at 4*, and used to run him with Ultron and Ronan (as leader), but switched out the Destroyer for UVision.   One reason I used my first arrangement was because I didn't have Uvision's uniform, and the second was that they were all strikers for each other.   But once I noticed how (relatively) squishy the Destroyer was compared to Ronan, Ultron, and UVision, I swapped him out.   He was my first 4* (lucky with the sales), so I really wanted to use him, but he just didn't seem tanky enough.   But reading everybody's comments, I might give him another chance."
FutureFight,3c72ud,BossBattleE,2,Mon Jul 6 06:49:38 2015 UTC,"1 of 2 heroes I don't have. The other being Black Cat.  I honestly don't see it very often outside VS and the rare occasion I see it in arena, it falls way too easily and never an issue. Even in VS I feel like he's the easiest one to face and hope for the VS lineup where he's last cause I know it's an easy GG.  Is story the only place he's legitimately good? I might never get him if that's the case unless it's just luck of the draw through chests."
FutureFight,3c72ud,Thesparkone,2,Mon Jul 6 19:18:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not super-impressed with him so far, but he does have that nice 3-piece combo meal. I'll wait to see how he is at 5* to truly judge him."
FutureFight,3c72ud,TheDessertFoxx,2,Sun Jul 5 17:44:24 2015 UTC,"The only bad things about him that i can think of is he is a bit slow and his auto attack is pretty bad.  other than that he's the only character i can think of that has a stun, a beam, a DoT (two at 5*), and a break charge.  You can kite anyone with him pretty much."
FutureFight,3c72ud,emsqrd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:37:47 2015 UTC,"Just got him off of a pair of flash sales this morning. My main team consists of IM/War machine/Cap between lvl 26 and 29, so hoping Destroyer won't disappoint."
FutureFight,3c72ud,NgTurbo86,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:30:28 2015 UTC,"Wasn't going to post.. but since I see a lot of ppl are commenting about Destroyer being too slow, it should be noted that this is a non-issue when you roll a good iso set.  I'm running Divine Power at the moment which can boost attack, crit rate and crit damage by 3.5% and movement speed by +15% for 20 seconds.  Once you activate that he's an absolute beast and as LanceUppercut mentioned, the range on his level 5 is unreal.. basically wipes out half of the screen.  http://imgur.com/feY3xal  Add to that +40-45 Fire Damage Device and it's downright filthy.  Destroyer is easily top tier and probably my strongest character - worth being patient to get his bios."
FutureFight,3c72ud,y2fitzy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:11:12 2015 UTC,"I only have mine at 3 star but I love him. As has been said, his move combo is a thing of beauty. Tag him in, let him do crazy damage, tag him out and carry on."
FutureFight,3c72ud,kemeat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:18:59 2015 UTC,Destroyer's first and second skill also have a high chance to break. So in fact he has quite a lot of skill combinations.
FutureFight,3c72ud,Blurkillerex,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:17:39 2015 UTC,He is the only universal character that I haven't unlocked yet.. Damn rifts are so darn expensive
FutureFight,3c72ud,Trunksshe,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:10:44 2015 UTC,"Good, not really the best. He's really slow for me, and Super hard to get bios for.   I prefer Ultron right now, as he's farmable and faster. The speed really kills him for me.  However, he is fantastic on same -level rifts, I find. I use him with Ronan and Captain Marvel and his tankiness balances out the team."
FutureFight,3c7rfs,YakElitism,3,Sun Jul 5 18:13:05 2015 UTC,It's a known bug atm. I'm on mobile so can't give you the link to mobirum. Sorry. Rest assured you are not alone.

FutureFight,3c7rfs,SageofLogic,2,Sun Jul 5 18:19:47 2015 UTC,I'm surprised they haven't done a quick patch to fix it already tbh. It must be a harder to fix bug than just lag would indicate.
FutureFight,3c7rfs,DarklordVor,2,Sun Jul 5 18:35:32 2015 UTC,I think most game developers are on holiday during the weekend. So it's kind of a normal thing that a bug would be fix on weekdays rather than on weekends.
FutureFight,3c7rfs,BobbySmithGang,2,Sun Jul 5 20:23:16 2015 UTC,I feel like if there is a glitch/bug they usually fix it next patch.
FutureFight,3c7rfs,Blurkillerex,2,Mon Jul 6 05:23:50 2015 UTC,It's the only thing stopping me from buying the costume right now even though I'd love to have it. Will buy once its fixed
FutureFight,3c85j6,SasukexDJr,2,Sun Jul 5 20:16:50 2015 UTC,"Ronan ultron UVision is a great team no doubt, but you also might consider Miss Marvel, as you've probably already maxed her (assuming from what you said earlier) as she benefits from ronan leadership too"
FutureFight,3c85j6,rhysappa12,3,Sun Jul 5 20:26:23 2015 UTC,Shes 4 stars Fully mastered. Shes does a lot of damage but is somewhat too squishy for me and has no Crowd Control.
FutureFight,3c85j6,BossBattleE,2,Sun Jul 5 21:02:14 2015 UTC,"I was considering a Ronan team with Marvel. I love Marvel, but I too got tired with JI. I just dunno who else I'd put in with them. Everyone says Vision with his costume, but I'm really not a fan of Vision. I crush him so quickly in arena. I feel like he's squishy, a glass cannon if you will, though I guess with Ronans leadership that takes care of it a bit.  I'd throw in Angela, but I don't like overlapping heroes and I use her in my main team with Blade and Gamora. If you got a pretty decently high Angela, you could do Ronan, Marvel and Angela. Or if you prefer Vision, Ronan, Marvel and Vision.  As for Malekith, since he already hits hard as hell, I had thought about experimenting with a glass canon team. Star-Lord lead with Malekith and Vision (without uniform of course). His blaster only leadership would just push Malekith and Vision to ridiculous damage output, especially if you ever got them all to 6. +45% energy damage is like having constant criticals."
FutureFight,3c85j6,BossBattleE,3,Sun Jul 5 20:41:10 2015 UTC,"I really like star lord but the thing is that he doesnt pack a punch. Hes very versatile but has low burst. As for Malekith, How well does he fit in with Ronan since they both have a team bonus?  Edit: How good is Angela? I passed her 60 bios yesterday and the team bonus with blade twice 2 days ago. Should I feel bad?"
FutureFight,3c85j6,SageofLogic,3,Sun Jul 5 21:04:48 2015 UTC,"Angela, in my experience, is a monster. Her first skill, Angel's War Rage is one of the best abilities in the game in my opinion. High damage, multi-hit and interrupting. I've seen bosses and opponents in the arenas health just melt when she uses that skill. And since they fixed her Sword Blow (the last part use to do like only 100 damage for some reason) she's an all around monster. Her only downfall is her passive, which is sadly only a 4% crowd control measure.  I don't want you to feel bad for passing her, but she really is one of the best. But I feel like if you're not actively investing or leveling a hero though, getting bios in a flash sale for the sake of getting them is a waste. I pass so many Malekith, Destroyer, and other heroes that people really like but I know I'm not going to invest in them so I don't bother."
FutureFight,3c85j6,SageofLogic,2,Sun Jul 5 21:14:23 2015 UTC,So her passive is as useless as Venom's. I guess I will keep an eye out for her if I dont get malekith.
FutureFight,3c85j6,TheDessertFoxx,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:36:41 2015 UTC,I use Thor and Angela depending on if I am clearing levels (Thor) or fighting in the Arena (Angela). With his Uniform Thor is actually a lot more viable than he used to be and Angela is better than Captain Marvel though her bios are harder to get. My Thor also whiffs attacks a lot less than my Ultron does.
FutureFight,3c85j6,TheDessertFoxx,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:59:18 2015 UTC,Thor is average and very slow compared to vision. But he isn't as slow as Ronan tho!
FutureFight,3c85j6,CountHalphas,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:00:26 2015 UTC,Well yeah I'm using them to replace Ultron not uniVision.
FutureFight,3c85j6,Angelshover,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:54:35 2015 UTC,"I use thor with his uniform but if loki or angela were at 4* i would pick either one of them over him.  only caveat is that thor and vision have a team up.  it's not much but it is something.  Loki is a better kiter and has a ranged kit and angela does better damage.  Thor has the best assist kit so it depends on if you actually think you'll use your 3rd or not.  If you wont, go with thor.  If you will angela/loki depending on what you are farming."

FutureFight,3c96gc,avocadosatlawx,3,Mon Jul 6 01:48:08 2015 UTC,"I suggest that you just stick with your first 3 or whichever 3 characters that you feel best to level to the maximum first and just pour all your investments in to them. Once they are finally level 40 and can start plowing through missions with ease, you can then level whoever you need at your own pace. You will also have more access to higher level missions as well as Bonus missions which will net you more gold per day.   Generally speaking, leaving your gear at +9 as well as skill levels at lv 20 is about the average. Your main characters should have more than that of course. These numbers are just my average as an end game player. You should just focus on getting your 3 main characters as high as you can so you can complete the story missions and elite missions."
FutureFight,3c96gc,Zephyraine,2,Mon Jul 6 01:56:08 2015 UTC,"I agree. Stick with your Core Team. When you get them to L40, things will be a breeze.  Also, start thinking about your next core team. :)"

FutureFight,3c75zl,Kallizm,2,Sun Jul 5 23:43:00 2015 UTC,"I know Snare Resist actually means Bind Resist, as anyone with the Snare Resist passive is able to resist both Malekith's pull that Binds and MODOK's Bind. No clue why they called it Snare Resist instead of Bind Resist, but that is 100% what it is.  As to Charm Resist, there are no skills current in the game that do any CC that relates to Charm Resist. I can only assume they mean to add it later, but that is a pretty strange thing to give to a character now, though. ""Hey, here is a passive that doesn't do a damned thing. Congrats!"""
FutureFight,3c75zl,chaoticheartld,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:39:13 2015 UTC,I know MODOK's mind control is considered a snare since it pops the dialogue over Spidey's head when he uses it on me.  I am not sure if Malekith's stun is considered Stun or Snare but Spidey resists that part too (he still gets pulled though).
FutureFight,3c75zl,lnfidelity,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:39:06 2015 UTC,"That sounds like an error in wording then because M.O.D.O.K's Dominance of Spirit binds, not snares.  Malekith's is bind as well which confirms my thoughts. Either ""Snare"" should be ""Bind"" or ""Bind"" on those two skills needs to be ""Snare""."

FutureFight,3c7kp0,lnfidelity,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:17:12 2015 UTC,I guess they're debuffs because all the enemies in the level can use it too. So a mob can all of the sudden be physically immune and you have no choice but to blast them until it wears off.
FutureFight,3c7kp0,lnfidelity,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:29:21 2015 UTC,"It's a stage debuff, at the stage select screen, it's at the Top Left by the title, I think. It gives the ability to the regular enemies too, not just the boss."
FutureFight,3c75ng,Benny504,2,Sun Jul 5 14:37:15 2015 UTC,"Team 1 is solid. Standard WM + two strong physical heroes set-up. DD is the weak link here, but only because the other two are god-tier. And he gets a bonus with BP, which is nice.  Team 2 is flavour of the month and deservedly so. Can't go wrong there. I'd consider subbing out Ultron for a better universal hero, if you have one. But it's a matter of taste; he's definitely still great.  Team 3 has a problem: WM is not going to get Star-Lord's boost. His inherent strength will make it still work out, but it's not ideal given how big a chunk of bonus attack Star-Lord grants."

My current Ronan team is with Vision and Destroyer (5-star). I like how safe each of their combos is. Ultron I use in stages where I don't expect a challenge and want to just roll the mobs and boss as quickly as possible (e.g. in unlimited lvl 40 special runs). He's still hard to equal there."

Star-Lord wouldn't hit nearly as hard but he's evasive and can still cause problems. But the other two would benefit greatly.  If you ever got them to 6 stars, the +45% you'd get is like having a perma critical going on. Then actual crits? I'd feel bad forever is on the other end."

I am with you though, i love daredevil (freaking Netflix got me).  Team 2 is a good set up. I run thor instead of ultron for the team bonus but thats splitting hairs... also ultron is better than thor.  Maybe try out angela, i have found she is excellent with ronan and vision. adds some speed to the team. Loki is another solid option  Team 3 is a perfect blast team.  if malekith bios are hard to come by for you try modok instead of him, but malekith is the best blast in the game.  also if you want to max out bonuses from star lord try modok as your third character over WM."
FutureFight,3c75ng,Ashy_Larry_1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:50:23 2015 UTC,"I've built a decent 5🌟Lv.45 Ronan/Uvision/Ultron. My Ultron is tweaked out so its hard for me to see the benefit in swapping him. Ever since I put Bloodthirst on him hes gotten even better.   Ronan has great skill combo with quick damage dealing skills. Meaning before one attack animation is finished he's already dealt the damage and you can interrupt it with another attack. His auto attacks are a bit on the slow side, but deal decent damage with good gear options. He's pretty darn beefy too.   Uvision is a great damage dealer and with his passive, and depending on the ISO bonus you equip, seems to never take damage. Especially with a dodge special gear. Plus then, he'll look super cool being translucently invisible. He also has a great skill set combo. His beam attack now moves to the next target if it is still active after killing the first target. Density Shift however, likes to still miss every now and then. I find his punches to leave a bit desired.   As far Ultron goes, he does well above average damage and is super tanky. With Bloodthirst he's even tankier. His auto punches are perfect(imo) too. The punch animation doesn't tie him up in one spot and it is a quick strike. Where some heroes have a slower 3 strike hit that leaves them vulnerable in that spot. and like the other, he has a good skill set combo. His skills provide perfect breaks to be able to get every skill off without being touched and either peace out or be swapped.   And of course, on top of it all... Dat leadership skill tho. It really is ridiculous. At 5🌟 mastery he has a +30% all attack and all defense... Enough said."

FutureFight,3c7hai,Nueko,3,Mon Jul 6 01:12:32 2015 UTC,"I usually focus on norn stones instead of bios every day, eventually you stock pile a lot of bios, its how I got 4 star kingpin, goblin, mocking bird,Sharon Carter, Luke Cage etc. When I wasn't looking for them.   On the flip side ,I got 450+ speed stones"
FutureFight,3c7hai,ArekkusuRin,4,Sun Jul 5 16:54:42 2015 UTC,I think it should be the opposite. You farm the characters you want and eventually the norn stones will pile up.   Why would you focus on norn stones and be getting bios for characters you don't care about when you can focus on characters' bios that you want and will just end up with an exorbitant amount of norn stones in the end
FutureFight,3c7hai,Drugs_and_Hugs,2,Mon Jul 6 04:43:41 2015 UTC,"With that method, you spread yourself too  thin on the stones instead of having a stockpile of one or two types. (This happened to me).  It's really all about what you want to focus on, I chose mastering over bios as my priority"
FutureFight,3c7hai,ArekkusuRin,2,Mon Jul 6 06:20:10 2015 UTC,I'm able to farm stones with extra energy after I've farmed the characters I want. And I have plenty of mastered stars. 4 level 4 characters all mastered and 6 level 3 characters all mastered. I haven't even been playing that long (1 month).
FutureFight,3c7hai,Drugs_and_Hugs,2,Mon Jul 6 13:48:32 2015 UTC,"You get at very least 227 energy daily(Base 144 and 1 free recharge), plus gm's gift 30-50 energy and 25-50 energy from assemble points. If you finish all the daily achievements that's 65 more. So basically you get around 400 energy per day, I believe you can farm a lot more than 5 characters. Size of the crew is very important and so is ranking up.  I personally do 66 elite missions daily now and this is after reduction for more material farming and special gear farming. I do it mostly on auto and partly by tickets, and only a few manually due to limited time."
FutureFight,3c7hai,hou_f,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:49:30 2015 UTC,"Do you only farm that many elites during the reduced cost weekends? IE, during the week, do you just farm Special missions?"
FutureFight,3c7hai,palmermarc,2,Tue Jul 7 11:40:08 2015 UTC,No i do this daily I do more on reduced cost weekends.
FutureFight,3c7hai,hou_f,2,Wed Jul 8 10:27:42 2015 UTC,"My suggestion is that you complete the daily achievement first then do the elites. Then focus on DD, Vision and WM first. From here I suggest you do the special mission, the level 40 one gives a considerable amount of exp and you have an 80% (I think?? someone correct me pls) chance of getting bio, given you have an able hero to solo the mission. If not the lvl 30 is also okay. Do them 5 times and let your energy recharge. Go out, play some games online, have a meaningful walk somewhere, whatever you do to pass time. Once your energy is somewhere 70 or 80ish, hit the No Limit session. It's crazy fun farming special like this and it's way more rewarding than farming elite. I'm sorry I just have bad luck with elites, RNGesus y u no lahv me.  tl;dr focus on DD, Vision, WM. Then do highest doable special w/o dyin, great exp, more rewardin than farmin elite. get the no limit thingy, do somethin while yr energy recharge and have fun goin crazy farmin dem souls  edit: word edit2: dont forget yr assembly point recharge thingy edit3: im on mobile sorry this post is rly hideous"

FutureFight,3c6aqw,hou_f,3,Sun Jul 5 06:18:46 2015 UTC,"Speaking of Ronan and VS he also is very good AGAINST Ronan in VS. Then again basically anyone that is slow already, hits hard with breaks, and has a decent combo is good against Ronan in VS."

FutureFight,3c6aqw,SageofLogic,3,Sun Jul 5 15:47:31 2015 UTC,"I find him very safe to use even @Siege lvl 7-9 even though he is only 3 stars lvl 40 .. I use him along with any 2 other stunner/disrupt/web like Spidey, Daredevil,Venom,Ronan or even with Hulk Buster..  You can cycle trough all skills with disrupts and they can kill bosses easily even at high level Villain Siege.. I prefer him over Ultron"
FutureFight,3c6aqw,Jellowpy,3,Sun Jul 5 08:12:09 2015 UTC,Ye mine is 4 stars and him with 4 stars Ronan can burn more than half hp of a level 9 boss(except Destroyer himself) in 2 minutes!  He's very solid and valuable alone already even if you are not running CO or any other listed teams.

FutureFight,3c70tp,xerxes3117,3,Sun Jul 5 13:39:27 2015 UTC,Starlord is insane once you hit 3* and he only gets better from there. Especially as a leader.
FutureFight,3c70tp,SageofLogic,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:50:18 2015 UTC,I have him at 3 star and same level as loki/punisher/ultron/rocket and he feels like he does much less damage than them.
FutureFight,3c70tp,Ileumn,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:26:41 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have the highest damage output without his leadership backing him up true but he has a guaranteed ranged break, a multihit ranged small aoe, and a multihit ability that makes him invincible during the animation. His passive at 4* also boosts his usefulness further (15% ignore dodge, then you can boost that further with a special gear) and his 5* skill is fantastic (and looks so cool). All the while every extra * is an extra level you can boost his leadership boost with (at 4* mastered he boosts the Energy Attack of Blast heroes by 30% for example)."
FutureFight,3c70tp,SageofLogic,2,Sun Jul 5 22:33:44 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend unlocking Star-Lord then just go for Ultron.  Ultron's final skill does great damage and levels 41 to 45 provide a great increase in stats, not to mention the extra ISO-8 spot.  Star-Lord is an above average Blast character but only because Red Skull and M.O.D.O.K. drag them down. I'd say he's like a more versatile Iron Man."
FutureFight,3c70tp,Spedwards,2,Sun Jul 5 14:09:13 2015 UTC,"wait, how M.O.D.O.K is inferior compared the rest of blaster? He's excellent against Bullseye in VS and occasionally Doc Ock, that bind and 3* skill isn't something to be sneered at + have good flow for his manual attack too."
FutureFight,3c70tp,Nueko,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:27:52 2015 UTC,Slow moving and long skill animations.  I like him too but he drags down the better characters.
FutureFight,3c70tp,Spedwards,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:14:01 2015 UTC,"I'd say get Star-Lord to 3* rather than just unlocking him. That third skill makes him an excellent VS character. Plus, after playing him at that rank, TS might well discover he likes the character so much that it makes sense to spend chaos tokens on him and just farm Ultron normally. That is what happened to me, despite Ultron being one of my mains and my having bought a costume for him."
FutureFight,3c70tp,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:38:50 2015 UTC,"The whole time I'm using Star Lord, I'm saying, ""Star Lord, man! WHO?""

FutureFight,3c70tp,lnfidelity,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:33:46 2015 UTC,I'd actually have to agree with you. It's what I did.
FutureFight,3c70tp,Spedwards,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:47:25 2015 UTC,Thanx ... i too was inclined towards ranking ultron ... i am really new to ultron and enjoying him really ... what skill combo do u use for him?
FutureFight,3c70tp,Spedwards,3,Sun Jul 5 14:22:38 2015 UTC,Depends if I'm against a single target or a group.  Single:   Chest Beam Robotic Slam Encephalo-Ray Electronic Field   Group:   Robotic Slam Encephalo-Ray Electronic Field / Chest Beam (depends if it's still a group)
FutureFight,3c70tp,tegeusCromis,2,Sun Jul 5 14:45:17 2015 UTC,"Against bosses, I find it is often better not to try to throw the beam into a combo. Instead, I fire it off when there's a window of opportunity, one which is not necessarily followed by a good opportunity to do the combo. Example: against Bullseye in VS, you can safely beam after side-stepping the moment he does a basic attack. But it's not necessarily a good time to do the rest of the combo after. You need a better opportunity for that, like when he's using skill 1 or 2."
FutureFight,3c70tp,Spedwards,0,Sun Jul 5 14:51:44 2015 UTC,"His beam hit-stuns so in most cases, it's not a problem.  I usually start a combo right after avoiding a boss' skill. If timed right, you will have no problem."
FutureFight,3c70tp,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:58:32 2015 UTC,"Then we're doing the same thing, mostly. To clarify, all I meant is that it's sometimes safe to use beam on its own when it would be unsafe to use the full combo. Like when you've dodged one of Bullseye's basic attacks."
FutureFight,3c70tp,Thesparkone,2,Sun Jul 5 15:16:41 2015 UTC,Go and get Star-Lord. He has one of the best evasion skills in the game.
FutureFight,3c70tp,Thesparkone,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:07:42 2015 UTC,how is he in VS ?
FutureFight,3c70tp,tegeusCromis,2,Sun Jul 5 17:42:23 2015 UTC,"He's great against Doc Ock once you get him to at least 3*. His 3rd skill makes his lasers go away as he jumps around firing his guns. His Gravity Grenade is underwhelming, but it's for crowds. His Hadron Enforcer is nice and has a knockback, but his 3rd skill is where he really shines. His passive at 4 is decent."
FutureFight,3c70tp,SageofLogic,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:06:07 2015 UTC,"He's great against Bullseye, too. Also great against Ronan, but he's wasted there.  P.S. In my experience, I Have a Plan doesn't make the lasers go away, but he is immune to the lasers for most of the skill's animation."

FutureFight,3c6k9s,tegeusCromis,0,Sun Jul 5 09:28:04 2015 UTC,"It looks like you're trying to help, and let me say. You haven't. Did you even look at the ISO set thread? There's only one mention of an ISO set, I'm looking for a recommendations on ISO sets for him. How do you make a selection based off of one recommendation?    As for the second thread you posted, it doesn't really do it for me. I would like to hear about gear option selections, which it doesn't cover. It does do a nice job about how to pull the most damage using the two skills. Please read my post fully and take a peak at the threads you recommend before posting them next time."
FutureFight,3c6k9s,tegeusCromis,2,Sun Jul 5 09:41:59 2015 UTC,"You asked three questions, basically:   What ISOs to use on him, How to maximimise his combo, and  What gear options to roll for.   The point is not that those threads necessarily contain all the answers, but that the discussion you want to have could have been had there. The reason these threads die off prematurely is that so many people would rather repost exactly the same questions rather than further the same discussion that is already ongoing. Anyway, I seriously doubt you will get different answers here. You go for a set which will boost his damage, because he has no use for tanking.  The only new question here is the gear question, which is fair enough. I find his cooldown to be quick enough, and the improvement from cooldown skills minor enough, that I'd rather use the blue stat boosts to improve his crit damage, to go with the crit rate special gear that is a no-brainer on him. Before special gears were available, I would've gone for defence penetration."

I'm 60 away from Malekith 5* and a little more than 100 BP off 5*.   One day I dedicated to checking sales every 30 mins. I actually screenshotted 44/48 possible sales.

FutureFight,3c5ybr,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:05:47 2015 UTC,"In the first line-up (Angela/Gamora/Hulk), why wouldn't you use Hulk in lead for his much better leadership?"
FutureFight,3c5ybr,SageofLogic,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:33:31 2015 UTC,Hulk and Angela are interchangable depending on if you want damage or sustainability.
FutureFight,3c5ybr,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:48:03 2015 UTC,"Just seems to me you'll always want damage with that team. Gamora is one of the best and safest chain nukers in the game. It's a waste to put defence on her instead of attack when she can usually pull off multiple combos in a row without getting hit. Angela is less safe, but you typically want to run her around until there's an opening for Angel's War Rage into the the triple slash. Then GTFO till it cools down again. This use pattern also synergises with attack, not defence."
FutureFight,3c5ybr,SageofLogic,2,Sun Jul 5 15:52:32 2015 UTC,That's true. Until I saw the opportunity to slot Hulk in there for Green Light every other option had a worse leadership than Angela so I guess I was hesitant.
FutureFight,3c5ybr,Drugs_and_Hugs,2,Sun Jul 5 15:56:12 2015 UTC,"I've been running Gamora with Nebula and Elektra. I like the team a lot.   You get two team bonuses. There is lots of speed on the team even though Nebula is a combat character. I would say Elektra is the weak link as some of her special moves leave her susceptible. Nebula and Elektra are extremely easy to farm. Gamora can be easy if you want to spend crystals with recharging your tries in the arena.   You can also replace Nebula with Daredevil if you want to run an all speed team, but I'm feeling Nebula right now. I added lightning to her special gear slot and it makes her a lot stronger.   Just for reference, I have Elektra at 4 stars, all mastered, all gear at +10, and skills at 20. Nebula is 3 mastered stars with the rest the same as Elektra. Gamora is 3 mastered stars as well but all her skills are at 30 because they are awesome."
FutureFight,3c5ybr,SageofLogic,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:40:32 2015 UTC,Sounds like a viable high-speed team! Personally like Nebula a lot more now with the Lightning boost gear.
FutureFight,3c5ybr,Gpaint,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:59:56 2015 UTC,Nebula was sort of the dark horse of the GotG release I always felt.
FutureFight,3c5ybr,Gpaint,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:33:12 2015 UTC,My Gamora is 5* and I can't seem to tell a difference if I use her attack speed or not. Attack speed caps out at 120% in stats for me with her. I haven't decided on a team yet but in the team you're using hulkbuster would be my lead with all attack
FutureFight,3c5ybr,Gpaint,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:09:18 2015 UTC,"Oh I see! Did you re-roll 3rd gear slot all to AtkSpd as well? I believe that the % needs flat numbers from gear stats to get ticking.  Also, I used Hulk as my leader because it has higher % and all 3 heroes use PhysicalAtt other than HulkB's 5* skill."
FutureFight,3c5ybr,SageofLogic,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:21:50 2015 UTC,No just with her leadership and bonus with Angela and blade is over 120 but the game shows only up to 120
FutureFight,3c5ybr,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:44:21 2015 UTC,"Possible bug?  Anyway, you should try re-rolling your stats for your 3rd gear slot to AtkSpd and see if it changes. As percentage without the numbers aren't much use."

FutureFight,3c6ec5,Spedwards,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:14:38 2015 UTC,"Just to summarize things for you since I dunno what you don't know,  This guide from Mobirum should cover generally what you need for your Gear Options. (http://www.mobirum.com/article/detail?cafeId=futurefight_en&bbsId=85&id=10609)  As an added comment about +ALL Stat vs +% by Lv stat:  Usually +All Stat is better for everything compared to % by Lv except for first slot. % by Lv would be better than +ALL Def or Atk for the First Slot depending on characters. For Example, Iron Man requires Phys Defence mainly and although a +10 All Defense is great on First Slot, a Physical Defense 50.0% by Lv will give +20 for Physical Defense (at Lv 40) which may be slightly better than the jack of all trades option. At Lv 50 it will give +25. Just to be super clear, % by Lv means % from your character's level. So 50.0% of Physical Defence by Lv Means 50.0% of the Level of your Character which will then be added into Physical Defense as shown by my example."
FutureFight,3c6ec5,Zephyraine,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:16:47 2015 UTC,So the Stats in blue text basically boost the stats in Orange?
FutureFight,3c6ec5,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:11:19 2015 UTC,"I guess you could think of it that way, but the simpler explanation is just that the blue stats and orange stats are independent boosts."
FutureFight,3c6ec5,Zephyraine,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:40:58 2015 UTC,Orange stats are permanently stuck to the Gear and will only keep increasing with every upgrade.  Blue Stats are changeable and may or may not be the same stats as orange stats. They are additional stats and are not related to orange stats in any way. They DO NOT replace orange stats.

FutureFight,3c5tyj,yoonjay,2,Sun Jul 5 03:29:00 2015 UTC,"if you're talking about normal story mode, i highly recommend enemies of kingpin with punisher lead,  punisher has great mob clear potential, and all three can take turns to keep a boss stun, even when you are at type disadvantage, you can still win, you start running into trouble only when you fight *several bosses at once  best part, you can farm them easy  it's so safe a team i got bored at dropped them at level 37"

The only time where Iron Patriot would be better than Falcon's when limited to one purchase is when Warmachine is currently ranked higher or more invested than Falcon, then having IP might just give the extra boost needed to plow through the game's story or missions.  Of course, one could've just liked the design of Iron Patriot cuz Iron Man suits, nuff said."

It paints the picture that you should only use Ronan and 2 other universals, and do stage 3. I know you said to do higher if you can, but you led off the point by saying stage 3. People can figure out which stage is best to run for themselves. You want to be able to run it reliably in at least a decent time.  You left out how great it can be to level heroes (I don't know your situation). Normal runs, do the highest stage you can do reliably. I like to use Spidey and 2 heroes who need XP on stage 5 for normal runs and my last run of unlimited. It's great XP, and even stage 4 is nice, as well.   Outside of that, it's a nice guide."

A lot of people write off his 3rd skill because it's a ""buff"" but it's one of the best buffs in the game. All defense increase + super armor for yourself and reduce all attack of opponent in range? That's double the value already!  I recommend levelling up this skill asap if you really want him to blood-tank.  If you get him up to 5 star he'll be an even amazing tanker since his final skill has built in stun and can deal massive amounts of damage."

I'm almost positive this team would have beaten mine had Cap been the leader instead of Iron Man. My team is 6/5 Ronan, 5/3 Destroyer and 6/6 Vision.    What tough match ups if any have you guys had. Post pics if you've got them!    Another one This Black Panther took down my Ronan and Destroyer with a sliver of health left when I had to intervene. Manual play does make the Arena easy though regardless of matchup"
FutureFight,3c4of4,Farmogoyf,2,Sat Jul 4 19:23:48 2015 UTC,"This is how I hope arena goes completely, all automated (no possibly way for manual control), and no assists. Either that or make the AI better. Arena is free honor points right now, and no challenge. I hope they fix that and make it more competitive, at least, so we will think twice about attacking a strong team. Instead most people just go in with any team and walk around the defenders attacks. That seems just dumb and pointless to me. I would rather have the challenge rather than the free honor points."

I definitely wouldn't have challenged him in that scenario and I now think Ronan is a very poor choice against top tier PvP characters.    I think that second fight is one of the strongest PvP trios in the game, maybe replace Spider-Man with Iron Patriot. I would have had to have a team of Iron Patriot (for Black Panther), Green Goblin (for Vision) and Vision to clean up to have matched up against that team in an Auto only Arena I think"
FutureFight,3c4of4,Sho1va,2,Sat Jul 4 21:52:22 2015 UTC,Arena fights also get much harder when your taking cracks the top 200. My main team consists of two 4's and one 3. 90% of everyone I see are in the top 100 with 5 and 6* teams. It's getting harder and harder to advance my tank in attend :(

FutureFight,3c4of4,ign-Dextr0,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:15:42 2015 UTC,For sure. I was hoping this would open more discussion about Arena match ups. Vision is most certainly a must have and the consensus here that Iron Patriot and Black Panther are top tier heroes also holds true I think. I don't think Spider-Man is there yet. The dodge boost actually needs to be higher    But who else? And how to combat them. I think Black Panther gets handled by Vision and Iron Patriot. I think Iron Patriot gets handled by Vision. Vision has to be taken by down a purely energy dealer that has decent evasion. I can only think of Green Goblin and maybe Malekith but I question their hardiness against him.

FutureFight,3c3qgc,orpwhite,5,Sat Jul 4 15:53:17 2015 UTC,"I used the stress over MAA, CoC, MMH and (briefly) MPQ. This game? The only thing I miss on a day to day basis is 'getting farther.' I'm not constantly comparing myself to others thanks to a lax PVP arena and, instead, feel motivated to move forward because ""I want ___ too!"" rather than ""RNGesus! I need that to progress!"" or ""I missed the event?!"" or ""AWWW! When will I get something useful!?""  I have dropped more money on this game than the others combined AND the devs seem to listen to their players. AND (yes, more) I used to play console games and get tired once defeated. This game? Less money, more fun, less time... but that's good! Summer! :D"
FutureFight,3c3qgc,Zephyraine,4,Sat Jul 4 17:49:56 2015 UTC,"The thing about this game is about how the F2P model is actually done right. Most games including PC F2P MMOs have set the standard such that players feel forced to fork out cash to get something they want. To make things worse, sometimes the buyers are still subjected to RNG even after paying. These items are also not obtainable in any other way in game. Many 'rational' people and even developers themselves argue that the whole point of these things is business and everyone needs to earn a living and profit. But look at Future Fight. People are still investing actual money in this game and they don't feel like they were being forced to do it, myself included. I have never spent a dime on mobile games, yet I willingly do so for this, why? Because I don't need to be forced to make a purchase for what I want. I don't want to get a character just by buying because that's how F2P works. That whole mentality and the execution of that business model where players should not be given a choice is plain wrong, yet the whole mobile game market decided that's the way to go. Arguably, there are certain premium characters such as Black Cat and Malekith that are not farmable. However just look at the amount of crystals that Netmarble has provided since global launch, so far I've seen at least 100 crystals for free thru notice twice, 500 crystals free due to iOS connectivity issue (which was given to android users as well!), and the 25 daily crystals which was updated a few weeks ago (let me ask you which game dev will put farmable premium currency as a daily thing). To add to the 25 crystals thing, essentially you will be getting around 700 free crystals in 28 days which is pretty much a free uniform a month. Which again, uniforms are not obtainable in any other means but Netmarble lets you 'farm' it assuming one has the patience. But that's the point. Options. in F2P model.  See F2P model should be about having options to allow players to choose whether to speed up game progress or minor premiums. However the reality is that most F2P models in mobiles often make premiums at a ridiculous price and the game will never ever consider distributing any viable methods for allowing players to farm the premiums with 'business' or profit as the excuse behind it. Little do they know that actually allowing players to farm premiums, they actually make players feel like they should buy the premiums instead. It is all about planning and managing the game's progress. Eitherway, sorry if I digress but I just want to say how amazed and happy I am with Netmarble and their way of managing this game."

Up to that point, I had not used Malekith at all, used Spidey/Venom considerably.  Malekith goes back into Best Condition, Venom and Spidey still haven't.  Kept playing missions with them, maybe four or five hours later, Venom and Spidey get their Best Condition back.  The only thing I can attribute it to is being IN a mission stops the timer for said character, leaving the character in a team does nothing positive or negative."
FutureFight,3c3usi,TheRoonis,3,Sat Jul 4 14:45:47 2015 UTC,"The game does indeed need some polishing and balancing, but since it's only been out for a few months we should give NetMarble some time to sort things out.  Personally I wished that special gears offered more than flat stat bonuses/resistances. They could've added special effects to your skills or made the gears themselves a bit more interesting than colored bars and circles. Examples would be some artifacts from the Marvel universe itself- Spiderman's web shooter adds a minor slow to your skills  or an Yggdrasil leaf that reduces your skill cooldowns by one second; off the top of my head."

I'm not saying it's useless, my IM does dodge much more and he does sometimes dodge some very fatal incoming, but he's definitely not dodging 45% of them. I would say dodge is a decent plus and surprise me sometimes but far from being a reliable defensive measure."
FutureFight,3c3usi,Zephyraine,0,Sat Jul 4 19:05:51 2015 UTC,"it's dodge, it's RNG.  I've got characters with 40%+ who has dodged full cycles of one hit specials."
FutureFight,3c3usi,hou_f,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:08:00 2015 UTC,"Ye i get it, what I mean is the unreliable nature of dodge makes it less OP than it may look.   This game has a lot of multi-hit specials which also makes dodge less effective. So I think the current design is not too bad.   Besides I am still curious if X% dodge ignore means ""I'll ignore that much flat % of you dodge stat"" or ""I'll ignore X% from your dodge stat""."
FutureFight,3c3usi,hou_f,2,Sat Jul 4 19:17:17 2015 UTC,"I see your point but dodge IS as OP as it seems. Your multi hit specials are not as great as they seem because the hitstun of multi-hit specials are caused by the first hit, meaning if the opponent dodge just ONE of the muti hit specials they will just run through it. I'm saying this from experience from playing Warmachine against these 30 to 40% dodge geared opponents in Arena. In case you're not familiar, War Machine has a very safe skillset where everything breaks and hitstuns the enemy, essentially making the target unable to do anything to you as long as you spam skills. But I fought a 35% dodge Cap America and a single dodge allowed him to come straight to War Machine while War Machine is still Repulsor shot or Supressing fire. Same for another 35% Spiderman. I don't have to remind you that they dodged the single hit Armored Clash which takes away his insta interrupt/break move which can be deadly when missed (example Aether Bolt can be stopped immediately from Armored Clash but upon dodged = Goodbye HP, same for Web Shot).  So you probably got REALLY lucky that your hits are still hitting, but I suggest you fight more dodge build opponents and you'll begin to see its OPness. I mean if War Machine can be rendered vulnerable from playing safe because of dodge opponents, what about other characters with far less spacing options or slower skills? Think about it."
FutureFight,3c3usi,Zephyraine,2,Sun Jul 5 03:51:34 2015 UTC,"I actually run Ironmania with War Machine as my ace. And I also put dodge gears on my Ironman(about 50% dodge now) in the same team.   I haven't tested it through like you do but I think sometimes I still see people got hit-stun when they went into the age of Suppressing Fire and Repulsor Ray (you know, AI sometimes does that)? And minigun barrage certainly breaks people since it does over 10 hits. And also Armored Clash actually hits twice in close range.  The dodge thing has just came out for like 3 days so yeah I haven't fought against a lot of those opponents but I have used a lot of my ironman these few days just to get the feeling of it, and he gets hit plenty. He dodges much more obviously but not enough to call OP.  It would be really sad that I am really lucky when I am not using dodge build heroes and really unlucky when I am using it myself lol.  I am not saying any of you guys is wrong but I think this is really new and we can give ourselves and the gears some time to see how it goes. And if it really breaks the game I am pretty sure NM would do something cause of our constant complains."
FutureFight,3c3usi,inkara,2,Sun Jul 5 04:16:18 2015 UTC,I am actually just as scared by dodge as you and any fellow war machine lovers. I am putting a 33% crit gear on him at the moment but I have a 48% ignore dodge gear prepared for him anytime I feel like I no longer hit people enough with him.

FutureFight,3c1rjl,ign-Dextr0,3,Fri Jul 3 23:56:13 2015 UTC,"The fact that I can get a lot of my favorite Marvel characters in FF was the deciding factor for me. I got tired of playing CoC just to get those high-ranked heroes but to no avail.  FF's overall gameplay is so much better compared to CoC. The heroes' basic attack in FF fits well with how they should. Up to now, I don't know why almost all of the heroes' basic attack in CoC is punching. Iron Man punches instead of using his repulsor blast, Hawkeye is punching instead of using his bow and arrow. It just doesn't make sense. lol"
FutureFight,3c1rjl,yoonjay,3,Sat Jul 4 01:44:29 2015 UTC,"I like fighting games and I loved the idea of a Marvel fighting game on mobile. I played Contest of Champions for awhile but as soon as I saw a lot of characters having the same animations I instantly got turned off. I started to see the amount of reskinned characters that made me think that the developers aren't trying their best to make them unique. Atleast make their ending pose different.. Add the lottery system and that's it, blatant cashgrab.  At least in MFF animations looks somewhat different granted I do see similarities between a few characters."
FutureFight,3c1rjl,neilliyo,2,Sat Jul 4 04:12:30 2015 UTC,"I tried CoC for like 5 hours until I realized the kind of game it was. With FF, I don't think I've invested so much time on a mobile game aside Minecraft, Kingdom Rush, and Gurk III. Seriously, FF is absolutely amazing and it feels like I'm playing a never ending arcade quarter machine (which is great cause I love arcade games). Love it and glad we have you on board."
FutureFight,3c1rjl,trekstark,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:46:16 2015 UTC,Outside of not having cutscenes this is a better game than MUA2 (not that that would be hard)
FutureFight,3c1rjl,SageofLogic,2,Sat Jul 4 04:13:10 2015 UTC,I started CoC and quit right away because it was not my type of game. I enjoyed FF more and the game style was more appealing.
FutureFight,3c1rjl,BobbySmithGang,2,Sat Jul 4 01:54:36 2015 UTC,"It's kinda criminal that it's CoC that'll be getting an apparent ongoing tie-in comic coming this fall, while we don't get such a thing for FF, which actually has a compelling story that can be told thru comic form. Imagine comics explaining how and why the enemy versions of heroes we encounter in Dimension Rifts turned out the way they do. (Yes, they do allude to that in the dialogue segments within the game, but a little expansion never hurt anyone.)"

FutureFight,3c1rjl,DarklordVor,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:32:04 2015 UTC,I quit CoC because it was like going to the casino and using slot mashines and if you're a newbie and try to actually play the contest for new heroes you're shit outta luck because every high level player plays those also. The characters don't even have special move sets a lot are just copies of each other including Thor's and Ronan's special. Even the special character based crystals don't guarantee THE ACTUAL CHARCTER. I sued over 400 of those free Punisher crystals and didn't once get punisher.... Ah... Memories. Needless to say FF is much much much much much much better
FutureFight,3c1rjl,BlameReborn,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:12:02 2015 UTC,also FF has better character models than CoC. almost like marvel heroes.

FutureFight,3c3u0i,WesFaram,3,Sat Jul 4 14:37:59 2015 UTC,"That truly does depend on your personal tastes and how long you intend to play the game for.  Since I already unlocked every character in the game, I got Falcon's 'All-new Captain America' costume as I really like him in the comics, and once my crystals replenish I'll go for Iron Patriot since it's a limited time offer.  In my opinion, if you intend to keep playing for a while, why not try to unlock as much game content as possible?  There will always be time to level up your team."
FutureFight,3c3u0i,Rich_DR,2,Sat Jul 4 14:43:26 2015 UTC,"Everyone's priority list will probably be different, but I'd suggest:  1) Vision - Undoubtedly causes the biggest change, as well as improvement, out of all Uniforms. A must-buy, makes a great character terrific.  2) Ultron - The best tank in the game IMO, and each of his uniforms give him a huge advantage over a particular class. I'd recommend the Mark 1, as Combat enemies are the most abundant in the game, and extremely useful against Bullseye and Ock in Siege.  3) War Machine - Top-tier character, the 10% stat increases make him even better, and the stun bonus isn't bad either.  The other Uniforms aren't that great IMO, you could just save up crystals after buying any/all of the three I mentioned for an inevitable Spider-Man Uniform if you plan on sticking to JI as your main team."
FutureFight,3c3u0i,TheRealSpidey,2,Sat Jul 4 14:50:00 2015 UTC,I'd say iron patriot and captain falcon since they are limited
FutureFight,3c3u0i,Axeltheking,3,Sat Jul 4 17:21:57 2015 UTC,And Captain Falcon makes the character usable.
FutureFight,3c3u0i,SageofLogic,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:50:15 2015 UTC,Get the uniform for whichever character(s) you intend on playing the most.    I personally only have Vision's uniform because he is far and away the character I use the most and the other characters I want to max don't have uniforms. I use my crystals on bios and energy recharges for rift farming.
FutureFight,3c3u0i,Ashy_Larry_1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:49:01 2015 UTC,Buy the uniform for the character you will absolutely focus on. That's 750 crystals for a single character so make it count. Judging from your main team it seems that you are in no rush to buy any of the available uniforms right now.   You can wait for new Spidey and Venom uniforms in the future. God knows Spidey has worn a lot of clothes and the devs are bound to make some for him.

FutureFight,3c5ydg,IrmaGoodness,3,Sun Jul 5 16:55:23 2015 UTC,That's uhm... Pretty much the go-to team here.  To a point where I don't even play those characters and still got my Ronan to 5-star because of the undeniable strength of the team.

FutureFight,3c40s1,Doc_Whooves,0,Sat Jul 4 19:46:50 2015 UTC,This. Only thing is leap should go first as it hit-stuns/breaks allowing you to safely pull (pull doesn't always stun).
FutureFight,3c40s1,Spedwards,2,Sat Jul 4 16:16:39 2015 UTC,"I never use Leap. Unlike similar moves like Goblin's rain and Spidey's swing, you're not invulnerable during it so you can take damage.  The Pull has 100% stun if it hits. If the enemy Dodges, you won't pull them so you don't have to worry about the stun."
FutureFight,3c40s1,lnfidelity,0,Sat Jul 4 16:39:08 2015 UTC,I don't use the leap very often (if at all).  I could have sworn I've pulled in Ronan only to have him start running around.
FutureFight,3c40s1,Spedwards,2,Sat Jul 4 16:49:32 2015 UTC,"I boss with Malekith quite frequently, I've only seen it where the enemy Dodges that the Stun doesn't work. I could be wrong but I figure it's just like every other status effect."
FutureFight,3c40s1,lnfidelity,-1,Sat Jul 4 16:52:22 2015 UTC,I wonder if Fear interferes with it. Say you pull them in but you strike fear so they run around?

FutureFight,3c40s1,lnfidelity,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:36:03 2015 UTC,Sometimes fear does interfere when pulling (boss will still be pulled near right to you). But you'd still be able to pull out aether bolt right after

FutureFight,3c407z,TheLostOne3,2,Sat Jul 4 15:39:24 2015 UTC,I was leaning toward Power of Angry Hulk as well. I want to make him a damage dealing tank so I wanted an ISO set that helps with both. None of the 8 ISO sets help with both of those so I settled with Angel of Death with the plan of adding two Chaotics that will boost attack and defense/HP. Thus boosts his HP and helps his attacks and improves his survivability. I would be curious about other people thoughts.
FutureFight,3c407z,Ashy_Larry_1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:32:03 2015 UTC,I'm leaning toward angry hulk too once I hit 6*. Seems silly not to go with one that boosts attack and defense for Ronan and that one appeals most to me  I'm running silent night now and it's not a huge game changer to go without imo. He can take punishment well anyways.
FutureFight,3c407z,Gpaint,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:26:10 2015 UTC,Not sure if the shield effects stack or not. Everybody seems to go with the hp recovery sets to regain some health without needing any recovery orbs.

However, if it's the same percent chance, they will, in fact, trigger simultaneously (Only the passive's Shield will activate) and you'll have to wait the combined cool down.

FutureFight,3c3b5d,tegeusCromis,0,Sat Jul 4 13:36:43 2015 UTC,True though nothing has been said to confirm it is because of Independence Day.  The All-New comic series was only released recently so there's a perfect reason for the Falcon uniform and they could have just added Iron Patriot because he was in high demand.  It is safe to assume it's because of Independence Day though.
FutureFight,3c3b5d,Spedwards,2,Sat Jul 4 13:45:58 2015 UTC,Actually the in-game announcement does say it's for Independence Day: see here.  Though it's also a safe bet that these costumes would have made it in anyway. It just made sense to time it this way.

FutureFight,3c1vfj,Treypm,6,Sat Jul 4 00:06:42 2015 UTC,You can always use clear tickets to clear high level missions with a full best condition team. There isn't much else other than doing all bonus missions and getting as far as you can in VS.
FutureFight,3c1vfj,-Harute-,2,Sat Jul 4 00:26:00 2015 UTC,Best condition applies to clear tickets? I didn't know that.
FutureFight,3c1vfj,eyeseeyoo,2,Sat Jul 4 09:33:51 2015 UTC,"Yup, and it varies depending on the mission. In terms of non ticketable missions like people have said for bonus missions, it's very low there, but Daily missions yield around 90-100% extra gold :D."

FutureFight,3c1vfj,palmermarc,3,Sat Jul 4 02:05:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, but sometimes you might need to save up for ranking a few heroes to 4 or 5 stars, as well as saving up to deck out one character with iso. In that case, I would spend every penny, otherwise I won't go below my limit."

Then the double bio event came around so I ended up with a lot of people ready to rank up, and finished the event broke as hell.   So my best advice is just be happy with what you have, and refrain from any big spending for a few days if you really must see big digits. Then spend it wisely when it's time to bump up a character."

To me, the real issue is your spending. Assuming you are using all your energy every day, and completing all daily quests, I don't see how you can constantly be running out unless you are rolling a lot of ISOs, doing a lot of ISO enhancing, and/or upgrading a lot of skills. Where is the gold going? Perhaps consider if some of that expenditure could be cut out for the moment. Personally, I don't much see the point in raising non-main character skills beyond 20."

FutureFight,3c1vfj,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:43:16 2015 UTC,Gold flows out really easily. My skills on all my characters including mains are at 21 max right now. I've spent a lot on upgrading/rolling ISOs (burns through 100s of thousands easy if you have bad RNG). Plus character upgrading (I have 10 5* characters) and upgrading gears.
FutureFight,3c1vfj,eyeseeyoo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:36:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree. Which is why I think the real solution to gold shortages is to take a good hard look at one's expenditure, and figure out which should be one's priority at the moment. There is no limit to the amount of gold you can spend if your goal is something vague like ""make everyone more powerful""."

FutureFight,3c346h,ArabianAftershock,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:22:05 2015 UTC,"personal opinion, since I've thought of this before:  I think some levels have no dialogue because nothing new would be added to the story.

FutureFight,3c26jw,SageofLogic,2,Sat Jul 4 05:04:52 2015 UTC,"Her powers are essentially the same as Ant-Man's, so I'm not sure what more you want her to be able to do.  I love Janet as a character, but functionally she's the same hero."
FutureFight,3c26jw,lnfidelity,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:16:07 2015 UTC,She has her bio-blasts which allow her to be a blast type with a few similar skills sure but so what? There are plenty of characters with 1-2 highly similar skills.

He may not be the ""best"" but I do thoroughly enjoy his play style. He just seems so enthusiastic to SMASH!"
FutureFight,3c1noj,Gpaint,3,Fri Jul 3 23:06:17 2015 UTC,That's a good observation. I do like his skills! They did a really good job on the model too. He looks pretty scary.

FutureFight,3c1noj,eyeseeyoo,2,Sat Jul 4 05:19:56 2015 UTC,Black Bolt is a good example of a late bloomer. His 2* version sucks but at 5* he's a beast. Same with Thor.
FutureFight,3c1noj,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:45:30 2015 UTC,"Perhaps they do become really solid heroes at 5-star, but would you call them ""insanely strong""? That's what I would apply to heroes like Vision or Gamora or WM. Unless the final skills of BB and Thor are truly absurd--like, Aether Bolt level absurd--I don't see how they can compete with heroes with no weak skills and a devastating final skill."
FutureFight,3c1noj,eyeseeyoo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:00:02 2015 UTC,Black Bolt's 5th skill is one of the best AoE - massive range and damage.  Thor's 3* and 5* skills are both AoE lightning skills that pack a huge punch with the lightning booster gear. I wouldn't put them in the same tier as Vision or WM but they're both up there and fun to play. I'd hate to see every single Arena team as a Vision/Gamora/WM team.
FutureFight,3c1noj,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:20:49 2015 UTC,"That sounds fair enough. I look forward to getting them to 5* in a couple of weeks. Still not what I think of when I hear ""insanely strong"", though."

FutureFight,3c1noj,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:53:11 2015 UTC,"No one, actually. As far as I can tell, the heroes people love at 5-star are the same heroes people love early on. I'm not ruling out the possibility that there are heroes who are great at 5-star but bad before then, but if they exist, they're not widely known.  There are heroes who are known to be great at 3-star and bad before that, but that's a different issue."

I got him to 5* just because I was hoping be be awesome but I just can't stand how long it takes for him to recover from using his abilities. The amount of times I've fired off his 2* or 3* skill only to have a laser pop on my immobilized self is ridic
FutureFight,3c1noj,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:09:08 2015 UTC,"He's kind of terrible against Doc Ock for that reason. If you must, just stick to stun and basic attacks (and beam when absolutely safe). But that's a waste of his abilities; use him against Bullseye instead."

FutureFight,3c1noj,lnfidelity,2,Fri Jul 3 23:14:51 2015 UTC,I'm curious why specifically those characters are better? Stat-wise?
FutureFight,3c1noj,Ashy_Larry_1,6,Fri Jul 3 23:19:43 2015 UTC,"Hulk is big-bodied, putting him in the same boat as Kingpin and Venom as far as Combat heroes are concerned.  Hulk and Kingpin both have awesome leadership, but that's pretty much the extent of Hulk's usefulness.  Kingpin and Venom both have reliable Break-causing attacks (this is when the enemy has a graphic that looks like a shield cracking), which gives the enemy a 1-second stun and will interrupt any skill. This in and of itself makes Hulk limited in boss fighting.  Kingpin and Venom both have ranged attacks that allow them to eliminate their big-body vulnerability (taking damage without dealing damage).  Hulk does okay, but just doesn't shine like some other characters. If you compare him to the small-bodied Combat characters like Black Panther and Nebula, he's just really bad. ;("
FutureFight,3c1noj,MegaMohsi,2,Fri Jul 3 23:44:17 2015 UTC,It's a damn shame that such a powerful character like Hulk has no skills (at rank 3 anyway) that cause a break while same rank Winter Soldier has 2 such skills

FutureFight,3c1noj,MegaMohsi,3,Sat Jul 4 00:37:59 2015 UTC,Hulkbuster is not a top tier Combat hero.  Lower damaging skills for how insanely long his cast animations are. Not to mention you whiff 1/3rd of the time on them when on autoplay.
FutureFight,3c1noj,HankPymWillHitYoGirl,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:46:52 2015 UTC,"his first 3 skills do pretty good dmg, arc reactor burst is a bit disappointing plus his passive grants him physical immunity for 10 sec, imo he's top tier"

His auto attack and skill animations are horrendously slow, he whiffs skills His passive is the best part of it his kit.  He has some good gear stats, but it all fits in very underwhelming kit.  BP Kingpin Venom Nebula Luke Cage Maybe Groot (Not sure as I do not have him at 5* quite yet)  That's a list of combat characters I would consider better than Hulkbuster. That would put him mid-tier right along with Hulk."

FutureFight,3c1noj,SageofLogic,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:54:55 2015 UTC,"Agree with this. The fact that Hulk's skills don't break already makes him a lower tier combat hero than Venom, Kingpin, etc. He has decent stats. Decent, not great. He is not super tanky (see Ultron, Ronan), not high enough damage (see UVision, Black Panther), and add to that, he does not have the speed to cover that up (see Spidey, Gamora, Sharon). Hulk is not Ghost Rider bad; just not top tier.  Same goes with Hulkbuster. Maybe tankier than Hulk, but even slower."

I want to make a second team with him as leader+black widow and gamora to take down any blaster heavy teams in arena but other than that I don't see much use for him.
FutureFight,3c1noj,Gpaint,3,Fri Jul 3 23:19:57 2015 UTC,"I think the main reason people haven't shown much love for him is because none of his skills ""break"" leaving him relatively vulnerable for attacks.

Such as higher break so he can safely get up in an enemy's face, maybe slightly faster movement speed, and a boost to defense (which yeah, a 10% increase may suffice, so if they ever release an outfit for him, that should be covered).   For a character that's arguably a huge fan favorite, and has been a pain to get bios for since pre-launch, he really should have the makings of a top tier."

FutureFight,3c1noj,ConcealedTerror,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:23:59 2015 UTC,Honestly damage is the 1 only thing that Hulk's doing ok(not great) in this game. Plus at 20% hp Venom's damage is not very very bad either. His skill's scale buff up a lot.
FutureFight,3c24j7,danieldaypumpkintits,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:34:32 2015 UTC,"Team attacks don't matter a whole lot, so not sure why it matters. Strikers give you way more damage over time, so stick with what you got.  The only thing Team attacks are good for is Special No Limit, because you want to burst the boss to finish easy levels quickly."
FutureFight,3c24j7,lnfidelity,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:09:09 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. The only plus I would say for the team attack is it is sort of a skill cool down in that you can unload your skills, do the team attack and have your skills recharged to unload again."
FutureFight,3c24j7,Ashy_Larry_1,0,Sat Jul 4 15:04:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Team Attacks are basically a once per mission thing. They don't even do much. Just a couple thousand extra damage.  A major flaw in the team attacks are when 2+ characters have attacks that push the enemy. E.g. Created Ones, using your attack on a single opponent is a guaranteed waste.  As you said, strikers are a lot better as they will come out multiple times per mission and deal the exact same damage they deal in the team attack."
FutureFight,3c24j7,Spedwards,2,Sat Jul 4 06:10:13 2015 UTC,"I'll disagree. Strikers are pretty useless to me and even detrimental at times (I click to switch, but that person is striking). I don't need a striker to come out while I'm clearing a mission. However, I can choose when I want to use the team attack, and that's for the boss. A team like JI has a great team attack, and it's a free use of Web Shot. Now, if you also have Spidey as an ally team-up, then you can spam Web Shot, and just unload on a boss while barely taking any damage.   Yeah, some team attacks aren't that great, but I still like being able to say when it happens. It's like an extra skill, though pretty much a one-use."
FutureFight,3c24j7,Thesparkone,0,Sat Jul 4 08:23:25 2015 UTC,"The only downside to strikers (as you pointed out) is being unable to switch to them.  Other than that, they are much better than team attacks."
FutureFight,3c24j7,Spedwards,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:30:50 2015 UTC,"I agree that striker synergy is more important than team attacks, but I also think you vastly underrate the strength of the team attack. It's definitely not just ""a couple thousand""."
FutureFight,3c24j7,tegeusCromis,0,Sat Jul 4 08:49:02 2015 UTC,"It depends on the character's skill. Some skills just don't do as much as others. For the team attacks I have seen, they generally use the weaker skills (not always the case) or push-like attacks."
FutureFight,3c24j7,Spedwards,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:34:13 2015 UTC,"Sure, but even weaker skills deal more than a couple thousand even at mid-levels. By the late-game, we're looking at tens of thousands when the team-up uses at least one strong skill. I just had the duo attack of my lvl 42, 5-star Gamora + lvl 36, 3-star Nebula deal 20k+ damage to Doc Ock in stage 5 of today's daily mission. That's not nothing!"
FutureFight,3c24j7,tegeusCromis,0,Sat Jul 4 09:55:59 2015 UTC,I haven't used a Team Attack since my Ultron was Lv30 so it sounds like things have changed.
FutureFight,3c24j7,Spedwards,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:00:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth giving it a go. Might not change your final assessment--like I said, I do value striker synergies higher, since those can get you many bonus skill uses in a fight as opposed to just 2-3 in the team-up--but it's a joy to see three high-level heroes take out a huge chunk of the boss's lifebar in an instant."
FutureFight,3c24j7,tegeusCromis,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:02:43 2015 UTC,"To add to that, if you use the character that has the quickest attack in a team up, you can throw in a lot of Normals while the boss is being hit-stunned to death. imo, that's where a majority of damage comes from. Like getting three extra Normal hits from Venom is around 7 to 8k damage.  Still, I can do the same thing when a Striker comes in, I just can't choose when it happens so my reactions has to be higher."
FutureFight,3c1mrx,Blitqz21l,2,Fri Jul 3 22:49:13 2015 UTC,"Resetting doesn't give you Revenge back, meaning you'd total 25 wins including Revenge. You need Top 50 to get 875 reward, not Top 100.   I end up at Top 500 without any crystals spent and without carryover, so I'm pretty sure I can get to Top 100 with one refresh, making me earn an extra net 100 crystals or something every other week if I carried over a set.

Stick to three main heroes and you'd be able to rank them up absurdly quickly by selling most other bios you farm."
FutureFight,3c2mv1,tegeusCromis,2,Sat Jul 4 05:27:42 2015 UTC,"This is very true. A way to possibly solve this issue is add a cap to how many biometrics you can sell per day/week.  But I'm halfway to rank 6 Ultron. After that, I'd just sell all my Ultron biometrics."

What is a game for you is a business model for the devs.  You can make this proposition only because there is reasonable provision of bios but yours would in fact end to be a competing bio outlet. If they gave in your idea they would likely have to compensate the losses, probably resulting in lowering bio drop rate.  In the NFL they say: don't mess with what is working."
FutureFight,3c2mv1,Woes_oh_noes,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:51:31 2015 UTC,"I completely understand that. As I said, it was just an idea I had. Kind of a ""what if"" or ""wouldn't it be nice if""...  But to be honest it could actually entice people who would have never had enough crystals to get a 1,650 or even 1,100 bio pack to spend a few dollars to get those extra ones they need when a really good offer pops in.   At the end of the day though, I do think they already kind of implemented this, it's just really cheap and not free. The Stark cash is a good deal, just have to be able to be patient and save those crystals."

FutureFight,3c1hj1,TheRoonis,2,Fri Jul 3 22:09:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know why everybody thinks that because Dodge seems strong, everybody is going to run Dodge, and hence we should all run Ignore Dodge to counter them.  I've read that Ignore Dodge maxes at 45%, while the Dodge gear maxes at 35%. This means that with Ignore Dodge, you have a 10% Dodge advantage, so it's better if you are only facing people who run purely Dodge.  Nebula, however, will most likely run Lightning Damage gear, leaving her Dodge at a negligible %, so she now has 35%(45%?) bonus damage over you, while you have the advantage of ignoring her negligible dodge...good job I guess? Same goes for people running literally anything not dodge-related (crit rate, etc)"

My point is that dodge is so popular ignore dodge should be the damage increase of choice.   Outside of nebula lightning and goblin poison, the crit increases aren't even that great so the other damage increases suck.  Ignore dodge against crit/poison/lightning will be better than one of those boosts against dodge (speed characters with team and set bonuses are >10% dodge commonly)  In your example of nebula with 45% lightning compared to ignore dodge you then said that it's the same advantage for crit etc, when it's really not.    Your original point was ""why do people think we should run ignore dodge, dodge and other damage boosts are better"". My point is dodge is awesome, which increases the power of ignore dodge, which you are now saying is the original point.    Outside of nebula and goblin, every character should run dodge or ignore.   *and in the nebula and goblin case, they are only more effective against ignore dodge.  They are gimped against dodge as ignore dodge would be better on these characters in that matchup."

Let's assume you use Thor as a pure caster—reasonable IMO, since his basic attacks aren't too fast and he isn't that tanky.

FutureFight,3bzsmp,CoherentInsanity,2,Fri Jul 3 20:22:08 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling it's supposed to be used as a distancing thing. So if a mob or boss has you cornered and is right in your face, hit it to push them back, gain some distance, and punish them."
FutureFight,3bzsmp,tegeusCromis,2,Sat Jul 4 05:59:14 2015 UTC,I'm sure that's right. Too bad it would make a whole lot more sense to just run away manually and then use the skill (if it came without that initial hit).

FutureFight,3bzsmp,BossBattleE,2,Fri Jul 3 17:17:09 2015 UTC,Just started using him with Yondu and Star-Lord and I've been very impressed. Disappointed in myself not investing in him earlier and wasted time with heroes that didn't really pan out as I thought they would.
FutureFight,3bzsmp,EdgarDom81539,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:02:52 2015 UTC,"Not as bad with uniform. Placing him far from mobs is a chore, though, his only niche on this game is being the ranged hero with the highest range but the high movement speed of mobs totally ruins it unless you can stun them on sight. Not helped by the fact that his skills don't place him as far as possible from the enemy as quick as Gamora's, allowing for easy breaks."
FutureFight,3bzsmp,yoonjay,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:15:06 2015 UTC,"As I posted just a few minutes ago, I have this fondness with archers. So, that's why it is natural for me to root for Hawkeye. I definitely loved how he was portrayed in the second Avengers film.  Back to MFF, I want some opinions on whether strengthening him is a good idea. Yes, I know that if I love a certain hero, just play and have fun with it. But, I want to know from someone who made him a 4*/5# if it's worth all the effort."
FutureFight,3bzsmp,tom641,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:39:36 2015 UTC,I think he's a bit underrated. I ran him for a while early on because he was the first champion I got from the first dimension chest during the tutorial and I replaced Widow with him.  Then this sub helped me realize Cap wasn't that great and I replaced him with Widow and ran that until I finally started unlocking more characters.  He does decent damage and can clear waves with the best of 'em. He is stuck in place while doing skills though. I remember he was my go to guy for grinding the box destruction missions where you get 1 shot if you touch the overpowered lasers.

FutureFight,3bzylf,punkren,3,Fri Jul 3 16:08:56 2015 UTC,"I gave it a go, it's not really as OP as I thought before that.  I put a +35% on ironman and he's having around 45% dodge now, and he's still only like dodging 1 out of 5 hits. So, % is one thing, reality is another."
FutureFight,3bzylf,hou_f,3,Fri Jul 3 16:32:57 2015 UTC,"Well, there are also resists and crit rate/dmg, not to mention dodge ignore, which directly ignores dodge and is available at a higher % on special gear than dodge. It all depends on who you face in the arena, and since u cant see their special gear before u battle them, its a risk ure gonna have to take. For example, if u equip dodge ignore on a character and fight someone who has little to no dodge but instead has crit rate, you'd prolly have a disadvantage but will beat characters that fully utilize dodge. If u equip crit rate but fight someone with high dodge(say 60%), u'd miss half the time but usually the high dodge characters are speed characters, and crit rate's usually used on combat characters ( venom, panther) so u'd also take less damage and possibly be able to kill the opponent. Somehow i feel dodge is affected by class but cant confirm definitively.  Tl:dr; dodge gives a huge advantage, but is not broken. There's ignore dodge that counteracts it. Plus, 50% doesnt help the hero dodge half the hits thrown by the opponent.  Prolly 2/5? :/"
FutureFight,3bzylf,crash100200,2,Fri Jul 3 16:49:21 2015 UTC,"I feel like there is a lot of talk about the special gear, dodge, dodge ignore, etc. as it relates to arena. Honestly, I don't gem for arena, nor will I, so I sit back and collect my 220 gems each week. Especially since its so easily to tailor your fights against an easy opponent. For me the application is much more related to VS. Then again I'm probably far behind a lot of people on this board (8 rank 40s, 5 of them with 12 gear).

FutureFight,3bzylf,toysoldierxiii,2,Fri Jul 3 15:00:49 2015 UTC,"Another thing to note is that it also triggers dodge-based abilities easier now, like Black Widow's uniform and Daredevil's mastery. So you can probably integrate all that into a nice team when build right."

FutureFight,3bzylf,ign-Dextr0,3,Fri Jul 3 15:25:05 2015 UTC,i saw in other thread its possible to reach 70% dodge so you are saying this will increase the value of dodge by 70%. but where is the number that will be increased by 70%? and how much is 30% miss one attack in how many hits on average? i remember some orange sets in gear to show dodge numbers so i will check the game now :)
FutureFight,3bzylf,ign-Dextr0,0,Fri Jul 3 15:55:13 2015 UTC,"i'm just telling you how most (like, all) games handle it, that number is usually a hidden flat value  i'd like to know, when you have 70% dodge, do you only get hit 3 times on a 10 hit beam?"

FutureFight,3bzylf,chaoticheartld,3,Fri Jul 3 20:43:43 2015 UTC,"I think ign is trying to say there might be a hidden calculation that goes into deciding if a hit lands or not, of which your Dodge score is only a part of it. I.e. the calculation may not be as simple as:  if (Random(1, 100) < Dodge)  {  You miss;  }  It may be closer to:  if (Random(1, 100) < ((Dodge * (difference in level * 0.1)) * typeModifier)  I.e. there might be a whole hidden calculation that goes on to determine if an attack is dodged or not, of which the Dodge stat is only a minor part.   I think this unlikely, though, as it would make no sense to then show us Dodge as a %. It would be INCREDIBLY misleading to us. If they wanted it to just be a part of a hidden calculation, then they should have given us the Dodge stat as a flat number (i.e. ""Dodge: 492"" instead of ""Dodge: 20.2%"").   There is some extra calculation involved, though, as you are more likely to miss your attack on an enemy higher level than you, and some people have reported it seems Type advantage also plays a part."

FutureFight,3bzylf,HoodooX,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:45:53 2015 UTC,I know what you are saying and I assume the same.  The upfront 'values' on the character sheet are rarely the reality of what is used in calculations.  There are allllllllways hidden values in these types of games.
FutureFight,3bzylf,Ashy_Larry_1,0,Mon Jul 6 17:31:26 2015 UTC,"Thats not necessarily how it works. I imagine its more like you attack, there is a process that then uses a 70% likely to hit that then determines whether or not you do hit. Just like how if you flip a coin, you could end up with 10 heads in a row even though you should end up with 5 tails and 5 heads. My Vision has a 50% Critical Rate, but he certainly doesn't do a critical hit every other time"
FutureFight,3bzylf,andaleo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:09:24 2015 UTC,Quick question regarding crits. I'm assuming crit dmg is displayed as the bold yellow numbers right? Cause in that case I get more crits than I expected with 9.1% crit rate on my lvl31 4* 3 mastery Vision.
FutureFight,3bzylf,Ashy_Larry_1,3,Fri Jul 3 15:27:49 2015 UTC,Nope if the number is yellow it means its a type advantage. So your blast Vision without a uniform was dealing damage to a combat type character. It will be grey against a speed type character and white against a blast type character. The criticals are the ones with an exclamation mark at the end regardless of color

Setting aside the fact that 30% does not equal 1/3, this statement is entirely correct. OP did not say ""every time my character is attacked three times, the enemy will miss once""."
FutureFight,3bzylf,Ashy_Larry_1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:02:44 2015 UTC,True. Over all the attacks on that character 30% of them should be dodged. I guess my point was to just say that it might not manifest itself that badly (like those 60%+ dodgers out there) in any given match up because of such a small number of attacks so it might not be as overpowered as it seems at first glance. Poorly stated on my part

FutureFight,3bz6ks,ArekkusuRin,2,Fri Jul 3 14:17:30 2015 UTC,huzzah! Special mission farming goes back onto the back burner...
FutureFight,3bz6ks,y2fitzy,2,Fri Jul 3 10:15:54 2015 UTC,"Ooh, in two minds about this.    On one hand 4 energy is great, on the other hand I'm 155/320 on Ronan and not certain that the GotG missions won't get replaced when the new Ant-Man content drops next week so will be doing the special missions as usual but cramming in as many elite missions that I can with spare energy.

FutureFight,3bxvzt,Grand_Savage,2,Fri Jul 3 08:43:44 2015 UTC,"I made a comment on his post. The one thing we need to know is do drops impact each other? I've always assumed that Mob A drops Item X and Mob B drops item Y; completely independent from one another.  If stages tend to have roughly the same total # of mobs, his tables make complete sense. If they have completely varying # of mobs OR if drop rates vary from item to item, then his tables wouldn't be reliable."
FutureFight,3bxvzt,lnfidelity,2,Fri Jul 3 02:09:37 2015 UTC,"I, in general, agree with you. The only exception is that in Normal missions, the boss always drops at least one material box. If there is only one material available for that stage, you are guaranteed material per energy just by completing the stage."
FutureFight,3bxvzt,Grand_Savage,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:36:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize boss was 100% drop. You are correct then in this case, if you are struggling to get even 1 per level, go for a stage where it is the only item available."
FutureFight,3bxvzt,tegeusCromis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:18:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I think the stages with more mobs have more items to drop, therefore kind of negating the effect (unless you need 2 or 3 different items for your upgrades)."
FutureFight,3bxvzt,tegeusCromis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:41:14 2015 UTC,"If the two factors simply balance out each other, why not go for the stage which will give you more stuff overall?"
FutureFight,3bxvzt,OrdinaryPanda,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:44:15 2015 UTC,"Because you may wish to use energy effectively. You can get 3 drops of what you need, or 1 drop of the item you need and 2 different ones that you may not need"
FutureFight,3bxvzt,AsteroidMiner,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:28:43 2015 UTC,"If that is in fact the likely outcome, ""negating"" is the wrong word. To negate an advantage is simply to wipe it out, not to impose a disadvantage on top of that.  Plus, your numbers don't match up. We were talking about a scenario where the stage with more possible item drops also has more mobs. To then compare 1 needed drops and 2 unneeded drops against 3 needed drops makes no sense."
FutureFight,3c0c9n,SirBenLightstorm,7,Fri Jul 3 16:46:01 2015 UTC,There have been tons of threads about both uniforms. I suggest you look for them.
FutureFight,3c0c9n,tegeusCromis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:53:38 2015 UTC,"For me, I bought the Iron Patriot and debating on whether to get the Captain Falcon costume. Iron Patriot is amazing and I love the looks and I noticed the damage right off the bat. The stun is super helpful in mob situations,area,vs, and etc. I'm running Uvision, War Machine, Falcon and its pretty fun. The play style suits me so I might invest on Captain Falcon."
FutureFight,3c0c9n,BobbySmithGang,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:56:31 2015 UTC,"Yeh IP sure looks awesome and I'm definitely gonna buy it. I'm just curious if there is any other changes that come along with this uniforms while I'm saving up for it.  As for Captain Falcon, I strongly recommend it. The old Falcon is so lame to me that I barely play with him. But now the uniform turns him into a brand new character. It's just so much fun."

FutureFight,3c0c9n,NGC2359,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:43:45 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, Falcon wasn't that bad before. Sure, the uniform helps him in areas, but it's a bandaid. Play who you like, and they'll be good. You only ever fight AI opponents anyway. The grind to get a previously-ignored Falcon into a playable character would be crazy long, and in that time you could make your current mains a god.   That being said, if you have an interest in them, it's good. War Machine's costume is nice enough with the 10%, but the added stun effect isn't anything to spend money over. Again, you either used him before and want him improved, or you haven't and it would be a pain in the ass to get him decent. If you're new to the game, I'd say go with both. They both team up with Vision to have a really well-rounded team."

FutureFight,3c06lk,tegeusCromis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:07:14 2015 UTC,"Id go for critical rate for ironman, but if he has like only 120% critical damage, i think the dodge will be better."

FutureFight,3c06lk,hou_f,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:53:32 2015 UTC,"Crit dmg is another story for me , i put one one vision because he has atleast 10% crit rate w.o team bonuses and he has an ability that can hit for multiple time ; his laser means that i can get more chances for it to be critically hit."
FutureFight,3c06lk,knightzeemo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:02:35 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't crit rate still be better? Let's assume the special gear we're talking about is 30%, and that Vision has 10% crit rate and the base 125% crit damage without a special gear. With the crit damage gear, you'd have 10% chance of 55% bonus damage, so crits would be contributing 5.5% to your base DPS. With the crit rate gear, you'd have a 40% chance of 25% bonus damage, resulting in crits contributing 10% to your base DPS."
FutureFight,3c06lk,tegeusCromis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:57:18 2015 UTC,I know it sounds like mathematically worth more for crit rate. But I have hawkeye with 45++% crit rate and he doesnt crit that much not 1 outta 2 much. My vision has like 170% crit dmg now so I at least can crit once per 10 attack including skills and autos rotation and doin 12k dmg with one density shift to a boss is awesome.

And even if it did, the norn stones type you use on a character stay the same as the base class even if a uniform changes the character's class. For eg.

I have found how I can get out the most damage as well. I'm changing his 4th gear options all to Crit Damage and equipping the Crit Rate booster. Should be giving me over 15% extra damage overall.

FutureFight,3bzdau,hou_f,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:17:34 2015 UTC,"Crit rate booster is obviously better than crit damage booster with currently achievable stats. Look at it this way: the contribution to your damage is crit rate x (crit damage - 100). Your crit damage - 100 starts at 25%. Your crit rate starts at what, 1%? The conclusion is clear."
FutureFight,3bzdau,tegeusCromis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:03:52 2015 UTC,I calculated before and Crit Rate boost was less (although very small difference) than the Crit Damage boost (assuming that I get a 50% Crit damage booster). Iirc I got 13.25% compared with 13.5%.

My IP's having 44%+ crit rate and 12x% crit damage now.  What I think is since IP's hitting many many times with his skills (like around 30hits for 1 round of skills) thus making critical very effective and reliable. We are not betting on one big move on him.  Besides, don't joke you sir don't need that to beat Bullseye :D"

FutureFight,3bxhz3,SJArcher89,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:00:36 2015 UTC,I'm currently leveling up my Falcon as well. I might so sure if Vision gets all the bonus from WH's leadership. Thanks to this thread I decided to try out Avengers A team and its pretty badass. I hope I can get my Falcon to around lvl 30-38 from this weekend.
FutureFight,3bxhz3,Sho1va,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:30:40 2015 UTC,"So is Avengers A!... the best team now? Or is it still UVision, Ronan, Ultron?  I already have my team that I play for fun (Spider-Man, Daredevil, Punisher) and I want a powerful team, just in case I ever need it..."
FutureFight,3bxhz3,-Harute-,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:36:05 2015 UTC,That team that you're using now is incredibly OP. People do not notice but the consist stunning and blinding can really be farm-able.
FutureFight,3c0717,ecwrocks,6,Fri Jul 3 16:05:15 2015 UTC,"I just hope they don't replace the GotG special missions, I need to get my Ronan!"
FutureFight,3c0717,Lanceuppercut47,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:08:57 2015 UTC,i don't seem them replace them because why would put all the work on make models for the mission just to replace them ui change because their are likely going add a 2th tab for the antman mission
FutureFight,3c0717,Blitqz21l,2,Fri Jul 3 16:13:58 2015 UTC,"it can create more demand to play hard if you rotate special missions in and out.    Even the person you responded to is proof of that.  ""I need to get my Ronan!""  Creates demand, thus purchases for energy, etc... to farm them hardcore"

Ant-Man and Yellowjacket are a basic must with this update.  Sandman would be an interesting character. I think I'd rather Wasp though."
FutureFight,3c0717,Jplato09,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:12:59 2015 UTC,dr strange i bet is coming in that update because he was part of the Kree-Skrull War but the other 2 could be red hulk sandman Enchantress too
FutureFight,3c0717,Jplato09,2,Fri Jul 3 16:19:05 2015 UTC,I see you're going off a clearly fake picture that has a very low chance of happening?  Just because he was a part of the Kree-Skull war does not mean he will get added.
FutureFight,3c0717,bigboydaddy5,-1,Fri Jul 3 16:22:33 2015 UTC,yea true because quicksilver and scarlet witch was part of that war too and their would be getting add in the update but yea im based of that pic
FutureFight,3c0717,SageofLogic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:24:47 2015 UTC,"My only wish is they add Super-Skrull to the game, because he is my favorite antagonist and I would love to be able to play as him. I do think they will add Antman, Yellowjacket and Wasp, or maybe trade wasp with Sandman or Strange. From those, Strange would be preferable.   Besides that, I really hope they don't remove the GotG special missions and had a tab with the new ant-man missions. Now, in the article about the new things coming with the update, it stated 2 new skins, which I'm guessing are not the IP and Falcon ones, so I'm really hoping for a symbiote spiderman and either a Cap Marvel skin or a skin for one of the new heroes.  This will be a good update I hope."
FutureFight,3c0717,Blitqz21l,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:20:26 2015 UTC,yea it seem like The Kree-Skrull War have a big presents in that update and if that the case cap marvel will have a skin and super skrull dr strange quick silver or Scarlett witch could be any of the other 2 chars and i dont seem them but all that work into gog mission just to remove them so their just proble add a tab

FutureFight,3bxiox,OptimusYale,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:47:05 2015 UTC,He didn't agree with what I said. He just realized that you could see behind the barrier. He s still talking about him being transparent instead of translucent or something.   It is a bug with the destructible not being visible Through the reduced opacity of a character with the special dodge gear.
FutureFight,3bxiox,AkaTobi,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:01:27 2015 UTC,"I agreed with you. I thought they intended for him to be translucent, think shiny shells at the beach (reflective). They were intending for the graphic to be transparent (like glass), so that you can see through it.  Since they intended it to be transparent, they indeed had a graphical error with the destructible being invisible."
FutureFight,3bxiox,Grand_Savage,-2,Fri Jul 3 03:44:30 2015 UTC,"WHAT?! Are you just messing with me? What are you talking about.   He is translucent - semi-see through (not like a seashell) Not transparent - fully see through (like glass)  they most likely just made the special invisible gear change his opacity, therefor rendering the user to be able to semi-see through him and see the environment of the mission.   but because the destructible barrier is its own entity and not part of the normal mission environment it needs to have its own coding variables set so it can be visible through an opaque character. But it wasn't, so you can see through him and see through the barrier to the mission environment.   I don't know what you are talking about when you say you thought they meant him to be translucent (like a shiny seashell) and not transparent. He is translucent."
FutureFight,3bxiox,cy27,5,Fri Jul 3 04:00:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to argue when we both understand what's going on, you're really uptight for essentially no reason.  Most people don't consider what he is as translucent, it's mostly transparent. Like a parachute or tissue paper is translucent, things that let light pass through. If you can distinguish the object on the other side, it's transparency that you're dealing with."

Arguably one of the top 3 heroes in game and DD is not slouch either.  Memories of columbia: You lose out on Spidey but Elektra has incredibly mob clearing abilities.  Or by using Deadly Sisterhood and Death Dealers you get the 3 bonus for a standard 3-team bonus, even though Nebula obviously won't benefit from Gamora leading."

FutureFight,3bxp4z,Gpaint,3,Fri Jul 3 02:41:31 2015 UTC,WM is definitely better. Poor Hulk suffers from MODOK syndrome without the upside of having skills that are unique enough to get around being a huge target.

FutureFight,3bxqjs,EdgarDom81539,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:56:18 2015 UTC,There's really no meta possibility in this game as it stands. we need better brackets and matchups. With the way things stands you just reroll your matchups and avoid whatever flavor of the month you don't like.
FutureFight,3bxqjs,EdgarDom81539,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:29:45 2015 UTC,That's a good point actually. I keep forgetting the arena system isn't setup too well yet
FutureFight,3bxqjs,lnfidelity,-1,Fri Jul 3 02:29:27 2015 UTC,Scary. Waiting this gets fixed by Netmarble as this totally defeats the point of special gears allowing for customization.
FutureFight,3bxqjs,malach1constant,3,Fri Jul 3 01:36:37 2015 UTC,"Being that the nature of this game is basically single player and from all that I can tell netmarble pays very close attention to their metrics. I don't think it was a mistake, nor will it get nerfed. I doubt it's a coincidence that two of the better drops were put on the least farmed rifts."
FutureFight,3bxqjs,tegeusCromis,2,Fri Jul 3 01:48:15 2015 UTC,"Mmmm, they actually pay attention to their playerbase, specially on their forum/customer attention. And even though is single-player, unfair advantage is unfair advantage on arena. There have been posts on the forums about how Vision is incredibly broken and the devs have shown interest on them. So, we'll eventually get nerfs. That's the nature of every game with a competitive metagame."
FutureFight,3bxqjs,tegeusCromis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:41:09 2015 UTC,My point is that it isn't competitive at all. Every single person has a 10 game win streak. No one ever loses. That's not competitive that's single player. Most people only go for low hanging fruit and they will continue to reroll until they get a matchup they can guaranteed win.   We need to all post on netmarble forums to have loses remove half the points that the person who beat you gained. I guarantee that little change will remove all the crap 2* p2p teams in the top 100 bc everyone will continue to pummel them into the lower brackets.   Then the top will really be the top. But I'd also want assists removed too bc that's bs. I have all level 45/5* characters as assists. That's just ridiculous.

FutureFight,3bxqjs,hou_f,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:00:46 2015 UTC,"What we have is a big risk/reward mismatch. When I'm on a 10 game win streak, if I lose one match I lose:   Rank points for losing the match 55 potential ""win streak bonus"" rank points 25 honor points   And if I win a particularly challenging match, I might benefit by 2-3 rank points. There's no benefit whatsoever to taking risks, and there's far too much downside.  My feeling is that losing honor points is too much downside for Arena. The risk should be entirely about ranking. Give us 50 honor points for playing a match, regardless of outcome, as a way of promoting activity. That's what honor points are for.  Once that's fixed, people will care about rank in the arena because, well, I'm doing it anyway, so I might as well try to get as high as I can and maximize my crystal payout. Adjustments can be made to risk/reward strictly based on ranking. Take out assists completely or at least allow assists on the defending team. Remove win streak bonus points. Do some work to make it a challenge to face a team of equal strength (even though the attacker will always have an advantage via selection, ordering, and manual control)."

The system in play is not even a shell of competition, it's pve grinding."

I did agree with his saying give people 50 honor win or lose but I think there needs to be a system that actually fosters good builds and well played teams.

FutureFight,3bxqjs,PorkBunGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:44:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, I would love a system that eliminated assists, rewarded Honor tokens for win or loss (so no de-incentivizing hard matches), AND matched people up randomly (that way you COULDN'T just seek out the easiest high-point player on your 13th refresh). To keep it fair, perhaps even give a choice of 3 opponents, but you had to choose one of those 3. In that case, ranking would mean a LOT more than it does now.   Granted, there would still be the problem of simply spending crystals to get to the top, but I don't see NetMarble removing that. It earns them too much money from crystal sales, and they made such a wonderful game I find it hard to begrudge them that.  As to this Reddit community owning the top half of 100; I say it is pretty much a guarantee. Just reading the official NetMarble forums will show the gulf of difference in knowledge and skill between the average player and the community here. Everyone involved in this community have done a damn fine job of fostering knowledge and the sharing of skills.  When/if they ever form guilds in the game, I personally think a Reddit group is a sure-fire great idea."
FutureFight,3bxqjs,lnfidelity,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:43:05 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more. I always pick the highest rank people in the list (unless he's got heroes way way way higher level/rank than me which i know i would be 100% losing) just for the challenge.   Other than deducting marks on loses I think reducing the freedom of choosing opponents would be helpful too. Like you have no/limited refresh quotas per fight. And also shorten the opponents list every time. One of the problems right now is you can actually CHOOSE a far weaker opponent to fight on purpose.

Use your weak team like one or two wins at a time rather than as your tenth fight.  The people you Revenge Match against will be lower point totals than you, and since the points you get are based on differential, you want to do Revenges as early into the day as possible.

That's the team I roll in PvP 95% of the time, I just solo 1v3 with Spidey.  I want to get Revenges finished as early into the day as I can, because the people who attack you have less points than you, which will boost the enemies that you can attack when you refresh during the day.

When the 3 appear from bottom right, move into position and use electronic field.  Run up to the right hand side field then to the left and then back to the opening of the room and use beam once lined up.  More should appear in that opening and the AI should then do a leap+beam then a leap clearing the last bad guy out and onto Ronan.

Most probably the same logic applies to Google Play. I was playing it on an Android phone before and switched to an Apple. After installing, I had to start the game first (lvl 1) then sync with my Facebook (orig). My Game Center synced with the lvl 1 as soon as I started playing. So yeah."

I mean, you get 4 assist heroes for cryin' out loud! I like it when it happens, totally not complaining, but it doesn't make sense.  The expensive gear, skill, iso, mastery, ranking investments pay off every once in a while!  Maybe those fools you suffer are hoping for miracles and a lot of points for crystals at the end of it?    So do people lose points in defeat?  I assumed successful revenge took points away, so I take on players close in level that I don't suspect will avenge themselves to keep my points high as possible.

FutureFight,3bwl00,Sho1va,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:32:09 2015 UTC,"On that subject, I wonder if Cage with this booster makes him even more viable. Possibly even Hulkbuster, since he's got one skill that can cause a Break if it connects."

FutureFight,3bwl00,Sho1va,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:40:41 2015 UTC,"So it's definitely subtracted and not multiplied? i.e., if I have Ignore Dodge 50% and go up against someone with Dodge 60%, they will dodge ( 60% - 50% = ) 10% of the time and not ( 60% x 50% = ) 30% of the time?"

I just thought it would negate 15% of the time that a target rolled a dodge, but if it completely nullifies a 15% chance to dodge, that's pretty powerful.  Lots of characters have one-hit attacks, not to mention all those characters that have crowd control effects that only activate on one hit."

Starlord shldn't be fighting speed characters all the time, but its a nice boost when he does :) but seeing as star lord's first two attacks are 1 or 2-shot attacks, dodge booster could prove valuable :)"

I was pointing out the usefulness of bullseyes mastery previous to the update.  If someone has a messily 20% dodge you are only hitting 80% of the time.  Hitting the 20% extra would be 25% of the damage you were doing without it.    Crits aren't double damage, it's a rare mechanic.  I salivated as soon as I saw this one."

FutureFight,3bw2qp,SistarSoyu,6,Thu Jul 2 16:58:50 2015 UTC,"Yea, sure. War Machine is already a great character. You add 10% to all his stats and it's already worth it. Added stun to one of his moves is a nice bonus. Plus, it looks pretty awesome. Definitely worth it.   Startup screen said it's only available for 2 weeks so might want to get it while you can.

FutureFight,3bw2qp,Drugs_and_Hugs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:16:45 2015 UTC,So it just gives the stats bonus and the stun effect right? Because I just got Falcon's uniform and it's amazing! Two new equipment and two new skills. I strongly recommend it.
FutureFight,3bw2qp,SirBenLightstorm,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:07:52 2015 UTC,"Yup, exactly. Gives the stun effect to his clash move. 10% to his stats like all his uniforms.   I also went ahead and bought the Falcon uniform. It makes his character a lot better. And again, he looks a lot more cool."
FutureFight,3bw2qp,Drugs_and_Hugs,3,Fri Jul 3 17:50:20 2015 UTC,"I bought it immediately. I can say to this hell yes. WM is on my PvP team as the Venom counter for the 95% of JI teams, which he does very well at due to BLA > STR, Stun Resist, etc. Having him have a stun on top of his existing move, +10% stats, is just plain incredible. Throw on top of it all the fact that it looks awesome, and it was an instant decision for me."

FutureFight,3bw2qp,BossBattleE,2,Thu Jul 2 23:21:54 2015 UTC,"The 10% stats alone are worth it. That's close to what a rank up gives, so it's almost like getting a free star.  War Machine is a fantastic character with an excellent leadership. Definitely worth it. The stun is just icing."
FutureFight,3bxvtz,MegaMohsi,3,Fri Jul 3 01:39:47 2015 UTC,"Its possible, since the flash sales, we haven't had any other item sales outside of crystals. Maybe a discount on the new ""festive"" costumes, though some people might rage if that occurs. :P"

FutureFight,3bwa88,Ben882,3,Thu Jul 2 20:26:48 2015 UTC,It's not malkith in specific. The glitch happens when you are mastering a character that is on a team with bonuses or leadership raising the invisible stats.
FutureFight,3bw0hx,Sqube,3,Thu Jul 2 16:41:54 2015 UTC,"1) ranking-most important up to 5 star 2) gear- adds flat numbers to stats 3) skills- up to level 22, after that its very expensive and not cost - efficient, until you rank up till 4-5 stars, then if you have money max skills for ur main team. 4) iso-8- adds flat percentage stats to your existing percentages, very important at high levels, aim for 6-iso sets for level 40s, until u get to 6 stars, then reroll at will. 5) mastery- adds around 3% stats every star, so for members, master till 2 or 3 stars and leave it unless u have alot of norn stones. If its your leader, max it. Once u get all your heroes and spend the rest of your days just hunting bios, feel free to max mastery for maximum stat gain."
FutureFight,3bw0hx,crash100200,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:11:08 2015 UTC,The popular myth of not ranking up skills past 20 is a very bad one in my opinion.  It is very much worth it to rank up skills to max for your main dudes.
FutureFight,3bw0hx,Sho1va,2,Thu Jul 2 18:04:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But I'd like to add, ONLY when you have a huge surplus of gold and not much else to work on. You get probably the least returns on your gold spent for skills past 20-25, compared to everything else.  Besides ISOs, upgrading skills is probably the biggest gold sink in the game."
FutureFight,3bw0hx,theorycl,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:18:00 2015 UTC,"My suggestion would be to do 2 skills on your highest rank/favorite character to max. Make sure to pick the two best skills. Use that character as your lifeline for everything, especially unlocking bonus 8. Once at bonus 8, between that and VS you should net at least 200k a day?"
FutureFight,3bw0hx,Sho1va,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:30:41 2015 UTC,"Oh yea i forgot to add that in, sorry the text gets really congested in mobile :/"
FutureFight,3bw0hx,crash100200,2,Thu Jul 2 18:10:24 2015 UTC,"The simple answer is: All of the above.  If I had to rank them in order, it would be:   Ranking Up (Obviously this opens up more skills and higher levels, as well as opening up ISO spots) Master (This is completely based on the character. It can be everything, or nothing.) Gear/ISO 8s (Gear and ISOs add to your base stats, so they are equally as important) Skills   The reason skills are so low is because they are percentage based. If your base stats are minuscule because you have no gear/ISOs, then adding points into your skills are going to have very minimal return on the investment.   The higher your gear and ISOs, the bigger ROI you get on your gold investment into leveling your skills."
FutureFight,3bw0hx,palmermarc,3,Thu Jul 2 16:53:34 2015 UTC,"I read awhile back on here that anything less than 4 star crystals are a waste, is that true? Because I have only like 2 of those and I have held off on giving any of my characters iso's b/c of that."
FutureFight,3bw0hx,Ileumn,5,Thu Jul 2 17:12:37 2015 UTC,"I don't invest in anything less than 3-stars, and those only to combine them up to 4 and then 5 stars. However, in the process you will also collect a lot of 1- and 2-star ISOs. It's a good idea to equip at least the 1-star ISOs on everybody to get their set bonuses. I equip 2-stars on my best people in anticipation of getting better ISOs down the road, but I use most of the 2-star ISOs to enhance better gems.  Keep in mind you don't need to unequip an ISO to replace it. Equipping another ISO on top of it will destroy the current ISO, but won't cost you anything. If you just have a 1- or 2-star ISO in the slot, it's completely disposable."

FutureFight,3bvxos,ecwrocks,5,Thu Jul 2 16:19:30 2015 UTC,"Dodge % on Black Widow with a Uniform is pretty straightforward. The uniform procs on dodge. Also dodge on some (or all) team members led by Daredevil. Same reason. Crit % on a Hawkeye with a uniform. It procs stun on crit.   Right now, for everyone else without an obvious synergy, I would guess dodge if they are currently squishy and/or hard to kite with. Crit % if they're already durable or kite well.  I'm also trying recovery rate on toons that have healing ISO-8 bonuses, but my gut is that's not optimal. Kind of fun to solo a 5* Ultron in arena vs. a 4* JI team and finish the fight at 100% health (on auto)."

FutureFight,3bvxos,eyeseeyoo,3,Thu Jul 2 16:24:13 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you're referring to here with Thor. ""Call the Lightning"" and ""Battle Rage"" both say that they are Lightning attacks. ""Thunderstrike"" is Energy and ""Hammer Throw"" is Physical."

His two lightning skills both hit for massive AoE damage + the special gear he'll clear out mobs really fast. If you look at first two skills only - Vision's pretty average and Starlord is useless.

FutureFight,3bxo62,Sho1va,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:43:16 2015 UTC,"PvE or PvP?  PvE, really everyone should go with Crit Chance unless they have an elemental damage they can boost.  PvP, slow hitters probably need Dodge Ignore, fast hitters can use Crit Chance.  I only use offensive stuff personally."
FutureFight,3bxo62,lnfidelity,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:03:50 2015 UTC,I suppose PVP since whatever build used will probably suffice for any of the PVE as the game is currently.   Ronan is a slow hitter but at 5* he isn't using auto very often at all so he appears fast. Not sure how to resolve that one. If the spideys and dodge become a problem I might go the ignore dodge route but I'll probably just go crit first

War Machine and Falcon have 3 Elite missions and Vision has 2 Elite missions and a Rift.  Ronan/UniVision/Captain Marvel or Ultron. This is a Universal powerhouse team due to Ronan's disgustingly OP leadership. Special missions allow for easy Biometric acquisition and vision has 2 Elite missions and a rift.

The key is to have good strikers with you - Spider-Man and Hulk Buster are great because one jumps in when you attack and the other jumps in when you are attacked. I'm able to get 12 or 13 completed missions every time I unlock the unlimited half hour. That means I can run 34-36 Groot missions a day. Been getting 23-28 biometrics out of it. Wish I'd figured all of this out earlier, I waited a week before really jumping in. If I get a good team up (level 40 blast hero or level 45 anything) then I can finish a single run in as little as 1:34. Usually it's 1:45-2:00. Add in the down time between each run and it works out to 12 or 13 runs unless something goes catastrophically wrong.   Groot's gear and ISO-8 still need some TLC from me, but I look forward to using him in Arena once I have him kitted out and level 45.

FutureFight,3bybr2,jasonah93,2,Fri Jul 3 08:23:10 2015 UTC,"When working with ISO-8 There are 3 main buttons  Enhance  The Combine button is what is used to level up an ISO-8 which has its powers denoted in 2 ways (Stars, and levels) Enhancing increases the ISO-8's levels which is shown with a +1  at the top left of your ISO-8 image(varies depending on level)  Combine  Once you level up an ISO-8 to level 5 (+5) you will be able to combine the ISO-8. This requires 2 ISO-8 of the same kind(color), amount of stars, and level (5). The highest amount of stars an ISO-8 May have is 6. When you have an ISO-8 That is level 5 its Enhance Button Will be replaced with Combine  Select  This is used to Select which ISO-8 you wish to combine or enhance INTO another   NOTE: Like spedwards said its easier to stick with higher ISO 8 to enhance, a 2 star  ISO-8 gives you more towards an enhancement than a 1 star will. Most people also only level up their 3 star+ ISO-8 because of the amount of gold required before hand, i follow this method even though i personally haven't tested"

FutureFight,3bx31p,SpendingChickens,2,Thu Jul 2 23:36:34 2015 UTC,"Power of angry hulk is definitely the best 8-iso set for vision, it's pure attack power. Hawk's eye is good, but u prolly dont need the dodge or skill cooldown that much. I would suggest u go for power of angry hulk."
FutureFight,3bx31p,crash100200,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:24:20 2015 UTC,That's what I went with. It's almost perfect for Vision and it has 3 Chaotics with the potential of five + to attack ISOs    I actually rolled in to Hawk's Eye first time for Ronan. I'm not so sure if that's the one for him.
FutureFight,3bx31p,Spedwards,0,Fri Jul 3 02:53:26 2015 UTC,Hell no. Ultron's Hatred
FutureFight,3bx31p,Spedwards,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:20:08 2015 UTC,"He did say best 8 ISO set.     Disregarding that, Power of Angry Hulk is superior to Ultron's Hatred. It provides the same bonuses except at max it's 8.5% instead of 7%, and a 12% rate to boost attack 20% instead of 9% rate to boost 15%. You do get two free ISO slots, which ideally would be Chaotics but Power of Angry Hulk requires two Chaotics anyway. The only difference is you swap out a Dodge ISO for an Absorbing ISO, again superior because of potential All Defense over Dodge (if you value that)"
FutureFight,3bx31p,Spedwards,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:16:41 2015 UTC,"I assumed he got ISO-8 the wrong way around.  Two slots is ideal however you do not want Chaotics. They are not reliable. You are better off going with Amplifying or Powerful.  Vision doesn't require defence. Absorbing or Nimble, doesn't matter. Vision is a cannon. His whole goal is to kill the enemy before they can deal enough damage to take him down."
FutureFight,3bx31p,Spedwards,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:40:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed but none of that answers how Ultron's Hatred is superior to Power of Angry Hulk.    Disregarding the chaotics is a fine thing to do, but just because they are unreliable doesn't mean they aren't better. In the long run you should be able to get to rank 6 + attack chaotics.    You are still giving up 1.5% in All Attack, All Defense and Critical Rate, 1.4% in Attack Speed and 8.1% in Defense Penetration plus the proc rate difference as well using Ultron's Hatred over Power of Angry Hulk. I would have thought you would be more in favor of Spy Tactics then considering that swaps out All Defense with Critical Damage    I get where you are coming from though. I would rather attempt to fill those slots with Chaotics that have + Attack than settle with using Powerful or Amplifying ISO and give up that 8.1% Defense Penetration"
FutureFight,3bx31p,Spedwards,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:50:06 2015 UTC,20% proc chance over 9% isn't going to matter. Vision hits fast. 5% proc damage increase is almost nothing. Small increases in bonuses aren't going to matter too much. Two Chaotic ISO-8s with Attack stats == Two Amplifying ISO-8s with Attack stats. Other stats make no difference. Two unenhanced rank 5 ISO-8s will increase attack by about 2% which makes up difference in set bonus.
FutureFight,3bx31p,Phil2512,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:02:20 2015 UTC,"Right, agree to disagree then. You say the other stats on the Chaotics make no difference, I say I'd rather have them than not. A Chaotic with +100 Energy Attack and +200 HP (as an example but really anything else, Critical Rate, Critical Damage, Defense etc) is much more valuable than a +100 Energy Attack Amplifying ISO. You say the small % increases don't matter, I think they add value. Plus there is the 8.1% Defense Penetration.    All told, there is enough value, to me, in those bumps that makes Power of Angry Hulk far superior to Ultron's Hatred taking into account the difficulty of obtaining rank 6 + Attack Chaotics ISOs over rank 6 Amplifying/All Attack Powerful ISOs"

I play this game all day because my situation allows it without going into detail. And every time a team gains best condition I switch and get shifters. So I basically get shifters thought the whole day. I let my teams rest and then do it again. Works every time.

FutureFight,3bvzn0,tegeusCromis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:49:15 2015 UTC,I rolled that too and kept it. I like destroyer for pure damage personally. Also if you're running Ronan the attack and defense bonus from that set stacks nicely with his leadership
FutureFight,3bvzn0,Gpaint,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:36:27 2015 UTC,"Destroyer is a real head scratcher for me. I'm not sure what to go for him. His gears have him set up as an attacker with Critical Rate, Critical Damage, Skill Cooldown but could also be set up pretty well as a defensive unit.  Skill Cooldown is only given by: Escape Artist, Huntress of Heaven, Divine Power and Hawk's Eye. I don't really want a proc on Skill Cooldown so I'm not really looking at those.    Caveat is I value chaotics. As an attacker I am loathe to pick Hawk's Eye over Divine Power because with Divine Power you can have 4 chaotics. Only issue is Divine Power's proc sucks, I don't really care for a Movement Speed boost and you also lose +8.1% Dodge for those two extra chaotics. Not sure if that is enough of a downside to pick Hawk's Eye over Divine Power though.    As a defender the options open up a bit more I think. Huntress of Heaven is a great one for that, Bloodthirst, Animal Instinct, Silent Night.    I prefer the attacking build so when I get around to it, I think I will be using Divine Power on Destroyer"
FutureFight,3bvzn0,Ashy_Larry_1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:02:56 2015 UTC,"My only issue in using a cooldown as part of the ISO bonuses and not a proc is that I don't have a full set of 6* ISOs to use (I don't even have one!) in order to get that full values shown whereas with something like Angel of Death, a set of 1* ISOs will proc the same percentage each time.  I've got Angel of Death on Ronan and it works perfectly, okay it's not everytime but when it does kick in, it is noticeable and am weighing up losing Bloodthirst's shield to do so."
FutureFight,3bvzn0,Lanceuppercut47,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:35:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely my post was almost purely theoretical. Currently I only have ISOs on Vision and Ultron and wish I didn't have them on Ultron!    That's a very good point about the proc values. Those don't scale like the base bonuses. In that case, Angel of Death looks really good. Also Martial Arts Master is worthy of consideration I think."
FutureFight,3bvzn0,Ashy_Larry_1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:49:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly, for 4 trash ISOs you have a more substantial reduction  than what the equivalent permanent bonus set could get you.  Edit: as an example Divine Power with a 2* set = 3.3% reduction but a 1* AoD set, 15% which gets me a second off Ronan's specials but that 3.3% does nothing for my Venom."

FutureFight,3bucvh,Gpaint,2,Thu Jul 2 05:52:04 2015 UTC,"You can easily go higher than this though since it's a 3* mastered Spidey, with Black Bolt and Daredevil for dodge bonuses, green Dodge gear rather than blue, and his 3rd gear rollable bonuses are all HP rather than dodge.

FutureFight,3bucvh,creamcityjw,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:53:28 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of things are becoming viable now with special gear.  With a high-end Crit Boost, you can achieve 40% or higher Crit Rate.

FutureFight,3bucvh,Malekith24,2,Thu Jul 2 06:14:05 2015 UTC,"At a guess, I would expect Dodge builds to become a thing pretty shortly. For characters that had the main weakness of being squishy (due to low Defense or low HP), this will give them a large dose of survivability they couldn't otherwise get elsewhere. Even getting a character's Dodge to 50% means they will take, on average, about 50% less damage than they would have before. If one focused heavily on dodge through equipment, ISO, skills, and these new special gears they could probably top out well above 50%. Fighting something that avoids all damage from 4/5 of your attacks would be a nightmare. It means they also avoid any debuffs/CC/Breaks attached to those attacks as well.  I also expect this means Star-Lord's passive and Bullseye's leadership abilities will gain a bit more value."

FutureFight,3bucvh,Lanceuppercut47,2,Thu Jul 2 23:18:24 2015 UTC,"Dodge will not become meta due to the fact an ignore dodge item which can mitigate 45% dodge exists.  If you run a dodge tank team against people with such an item you WILL lose that matchup more than you'd win.  People  who are overreacting  to this and suddenly go all in on the dodge mechanic will be wildly disappointed.  I will keep 45% ignore dodge on my Ronan/Vision/Ultron  team and still keep it on autoplay and watch my rank climb.  That being said the item is going to be AMAZING for all forms of pve including VS. However for arena it's going to fall flat.  So for my pve adventures I'm def throwing dodge on BW, Spidey, DD, etc."

FutureFight,3bucvh,tegeusCromis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:35:08 2015 UTC,"Well, it is, because dodge based builds were not very highly sought after before this update because you're running glass cannons who don't do as much damage as high tier teams already, while relying on low dodge %'s to compensate.   Dodge is never going to be ""meta""  when it comes to arena. It's just silly to think otherwise."
FutureFight,3bucvh,chaoticheartld,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:38:23 2015 UTC,"The dodge gear on its own is so effective that I don't see why you wouldn't just throw it on whatever hero is best. What else are you going to use? Crit? Web, when you can negate that skill entirely with a timely break? I don't think so.  I agree that it's not going to be smart to go all-in on dodge, but that does not mean we won't see the dodge gear everywhere."
FutureFight,3bucvh,HankPymWillHitYoGirl,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:42:30 2015 UTC,"If we could simply replace our special gears on the fly, WITHOUT it also destroying the previous gear, I would agree with you. As it is now, though, in order to counter a possible Dodge build I would have to put Ignore Dodge gear on all of my arena characters on the slight off-chance I run into a Dodge team. This means I can't put Crit Rate or Crit Damage, or even one of the Damage Type Modifiers on them; all of which are much better choices if I am going up against anything other than a Dodge team.   In addition, putting the Ignore Dodge on my best characters (which are almost always also my arena characters) means I gimp them for VS and other parts of the game.  What I am trying to say is Ignore Dodge gears aren't going to eliminate the usefulness of Dodge gears, because Dodge gears are universally good on characters (in arena, VS, missions, rifts, etc) while Ignore Dodge is ONLY good in Arena against Dodge builds alone. Most players simply aren't going to use Ignore Dodge unless they are either a) pure Arena players or b) Dodge builds become so prolific it becomes the only way to advance in the arena. This means there will likely be more Dodge users than Ignore Dodge users.  The best strategy is likely to be to have one Ignore Dodge character in your Arena team JUST to counter-act full-dodge characters. Either that, or run with Star-Lord or Bullseye."
FutureFight,3bucvh,EdgarDom81539,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:27:49 2015 UTC,No one said it would stop people from going dodge but it will make it so you won't see it become meta. VS and all forms of pve is a cakewalk without the items. Why put crit or crit dmg on your characters when the only troublesome hurdle would be dodge teams?  I see your  point but the other special gear options seem moot when pve is a joke already before they even existed. There isn't much of a reason to have anything else unless you're  a specialty  character like GG or Nebula who use specifically Poston or Lightning.
FutureFight,3bucvh,Spedwards,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:58:39 2015 UTC,Giving Dodge this big of an increase only screams for problems. I'm waiting until they eventually nerf the Dodge increase or at least give us more options to Ignore Dodge other than the special gear. Every hero is going to get more customization options.
FutureFight,3bucvh,chaoticheartld,-1,Thu Jul 2 18:51:38 2015 UTC,Dodge is still going to be useless in Timeline Battles IMO.
FutureFight,3bucvh,Spedwards,4,Thu Jul 2 05:59:32 2015 UTC,"Not so sure of that. Having a 60% dodge rate means you will avoid all damage from 3/5 skills. This is VERY significant; more significant, even, than what a high Defense rating provides as far as damage mitigation goes.   It won't be useful on everyone, but for characters like Spider-man whose main weakness was being squishy, this adds a large amount of survivability to them they couldn't otherwise really get elsewhere."
FutureFight,3bucvh,chaoticheartld,-2,Thu Jul 2 06:32:31 2015 UTC,"Having a 60% dodge rate means you will avoid all damage from 3/5 skills.   False. That's an average, not a guarantee. It is totally possible to never dodge with a 90% dodge rate.  For characters like Spider-Man who have low defence, Dodge isn't going to help them.  Take Vision's Solar Energy Beam for instance. This hits about 5-6 times. Spider-Man might dodge one or two of those hits but he's still going to get hit by the others.  It just takes a few hits extra to take him down, if he's lucky.  Defence is a guaranteed thing. Dodge is just something you hope for.  On the attack front, it's the same for Critical Rate and Defence Penetration. Crit Rate isn't guaranteed whereas Defence Penetration is guaranteed."
FutureFight,3bucvh,Spedwards,6,Thu Jul 2 06:36:45 2015 UTC,"I think you are over-estimating how much mitigation defense actually provides. It isn't exactly linear, but from my tests even a few hundred extra Defense only knocks off somewhere around 10-50 damage a hit; not a significant amount. Meanwhile, a single dodge can knock off thousands of damage. If the dodge only happens rarely (say, with a 20% chance or so), then over the course of a battle, the Defense will probably mitigate about the same or more. With a 50%+ chance, however, unless the RNG just seriously screws you over, the dodge will definitely mitigate WAY more. Dodging two 5k skill attacks will ALREADY mitigate more damage than even 500 extra Defense will."
FutureFight,3bucvh,chaoticheartld,-3,Thu Jul 2 06:47:50 2015 UTC,"Defence isn't as great as a complete miss, you're right there, however the only place I'd worry about Dodge is in Timeline Battles (as I stated) but those fights only last 10 seconds tops. What's Dodge going to do? Extend it by a couple seconds?  Dodge is also hard to increase as any Mastery or Passive only increases it by a small amount. Defence on the other hand gets massive improvements.  With a Rank 5 Ronan's full mastery, you gain +30% Defence. That's a whole lot better than +60% Dodge in my books."
FutureFight,3bucvh,Spedwards,4,Thu Jul 2 06:59:48 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but the other thing to remember is Defense does nothing for Debuff/CC/Breaks. A dodge, however, completely negates them. A character with a 50% dodge rate is going to ruin all types of usually 100% safe combos/multi-hit skills as well as play havoc with characters that depend on their CC.   Dodge the right part of Spidey's web shot, and you avoid being cocooned completely. Dodge Ronan's hammer drop, and not only do you negate a large chunk of damage but you also negate his fear. Dodge Malekith's grab and you SERIOUSLY ruined his day in all type of ways. On and on.   With Defense, you still take some of the damage and ALL of the CC/Debuff."
FutureFight,3bucvh,chaoticheartld,-1,Thu Jul 2 07:29:57 2015 UTC,"Defense does nothing for Debuff/CC/Breaks. A dodge, however, completely negates them.   That's actually not true! I called in Black Panther as an assist while I was webbed. Spider-Man dodged the hit but still started to bleed.  Dodge Malekith's pull and he'll teleport to you.  Defence > Dodge."
FutureFight,3bucvh,Spedwards,2,Thu Jul 2 07:36:12 2015 UTC,"That is interesting on the bleed. I know if you dodge the right part of Spidey's web, it will not cocoon you. Same thing for dodging Daredevil's stun, etc. Dodge Black Widow's bite and you do not get electrified.   Not sure if Bleed has some sort of exemption there, but most other forms of Debuff/CC get negated if you dodge them."
FutureFight,3bucvh,crash100200,0,Thu Jul 2 07:39:15 2015 UTC,"Well Black Panther and Gamora's fear is a randomly triggered status effect, much the same as Malekith's fear.  Probably has something to do with that. The effects you mentioned are caused by specific skills."
FutureFight,3bucvh,Spedwards,3,Thu Jul 2 07:52:58 2015 UTC,"Well, if spidey took the whole brunt of vision's solar beam and avoided none of it, he would probably have died, regardless of his extra defence cos that's an extra 1 or 2 hits, which give massive damage not mitigated by dodge. With dodge he actually has a chance of surviving for another few seconds, probably to web u and cast a few skills to take down your hp so, very useful.  Crit rate also provides a chance to cause significantly more dmg. Say your crit rate is 50%, and crit damage is 130%, that means u have a 50% chance on every hit to cause 30% more damage, INCLUDING SKILLS. Defence penetration does give 100% chance to cause extra damage, but i can bet it wouldnt be an extra 30% of your total damage,and with a 50% chance every hit, defence penetration loses by a mile. ( not to mention, there are no defence penetration special gears YET).  Bottomline, some of us like to live dangerously :D"
FutureFight,3bucvh,crash100200,-2,Thu Jul 2 10:33:02 2015 UTC,Vision's Solar Energy Beam causes hit-stun. You're not going to be using Web Shot.  Critical Rate is the exception to the argument (as you state) as you can stack it incredibly high.  Critical Rate > Defence Penetration. Defence > Dodge.
FutureFight,3bucvh,crash100200,2,Thu Jul 2 10:48:09 2015 UTC,"Unless he dodges it, which would give him time to use web shot, provided that the dodges come from the last two hits. And provided vision is a hero with a super high attack stat, that can end most heroes (not just spiderman) with a few skills, wouldnt comparing defence and dodge in relation to what is possibly the strongest hero in the game be a bit unfair? Say if spidey dodged daredevil's stun, or venom or ronan's fear.. that would definitely be dodge>defence :)"
FutureFight,3bucvh,Spedwards,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:57:03 2015 UTC,"Or heck, even density shift or microwave pulse :)"
FutureFight,3bucvh,crash100200,0,Thu Jul 2 10:59:15 2015 UTC,"You will only dodge 1 or 2 of the hits, because they are fast hits, you'd be lucky to only get the first part of Web Shot in before you are hit-stunned again."
FutureFight,3bucvh,Spedwards,2,Thu Jul 2 12:28:05 2015 UTC,"Say 60% dodge, that's more than half a chance to avoid an attack. Depending on luck, one can avoid some hits, none at all, or all of them. Provided that vision kinda owns everyone now, a 60% chance for a possible chance to shave off more hp from vision compared to if u just threw everything into defence and face tanked him is invaluable. So, dodge > defence :)"
FutureFight,3bucvh,tegeusCromis,-2,Thu Jul 2 13:04:31 2015 UTC,"You can't rely on Dodge. It it 100% possible that 60% Dodge never procs in a year of playing. Improbable, but possible.  Defence is always going to work, it's always going to lower incoming damage.  Defence > Dodge."
FutureFight,3bucvh,tegeusCromis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:19:49 2015 UTC,Do we even know the numbers? How much does defence lower damage by? We can't possibly compare them without knowing what we're comparing.
FutureFight,3bucvh,Spedwards,2,Thu Jul 2 22:38:01 2015 UTC,"Defence is a guaranteed thing. Dodge is just something you hope for.   That cuts both ways. Put yourself in the enemies shoes: would you rather be guaranteed to hit on every attack, but deal somewhat less damage each time, or would you rather deal somewhat more damage per hit, but have a 60% chance of missing completely?"
FutureFight,3bucvh,tegeusCromis,-4,Thu Jul 2 07:18:45 2015 UTC,"I'm actually looking at it from what you called the ""enemies shoes"" because there is no way in hell I'm using Dodge."
FutureFight,3bucvh,Spedwards,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:25:42 2015 UTC,So you would rather miss 60% of the time than do less damage on each attack? That's odd. I thought you liked certainty.
FutureFight,3bucvh,lnfidelity,-4,Thu Jul 2 07:27:25 2015 UTC,"I'd rather miss 60% of the time. It's not going to matter at all. Worst case, it will add about 6 seconds to each fight."
FutureFight,3bucvh,Spedwards,0,Thu Jul 2 07:32:44 2015 UTC,"6 seconds is a long time, I kill entire teams in 6 seconds, lol."
FutureFight,3bucvh,lnfidelity,-3,Thu Jul 2 08:16:37 2015 UTC,"So do I. Though for teams that are all rank 5, full mastered, it's usually 10 seconds per character (on average).  6 seconds may be a long time but it's not a big deal when my Vision still has 70% of his health and Ultron has 100% of his 34k health."
FutureFight,3bucvh,tegeusCromis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:20:53 2015 UTC,"It's still one or two skill rotations for me to kill your characters, if you miss half of your attacks, it could be an extra 10 - 20 seconds while you wait for your skills to cool down twice.  I'm too busy farming other stuff to be farming Iron Fist Dimension rifts, but I'll do this eventually."
FutureFight,3bucvh,mikemil50,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:27:32 2015 UTC,"But if your victim had gone for defence boosts over dodge (if that was possible), it also wouldn't matter. That would also just add a few more seconds to the fight."
FutureFight,3bucvh,Spedwards,2,Thu Jul 2 09:18:27 2015 UTC,It's also totally possible to never get hit with your dodge at 5%. So what?
FutureFight,3bucvh,mikemil50,0,Thu Jul 2 13:32:02 2015 UTC,It's also totally possible to never dodge.
FutureFight,3bucvh,Spedwards,2,Thu Jul 2 14:16:52 2015 UTC,"Right, that's what you said the first time."
FutureFight,3bucvh,mikemil50,-2,Thu Jul 2 14:18:50 2015 UTC,And I haven't changed my stance. Your point simply has no value to the argument.
FutureFight,3bucvh,Spedwards,3,Thu Jul 2 14:20:33 2015 UTC,"Your* and it's a counter to your argument. You say that even having 60% dodge is irrelevant because you could still get hit with every attack. That's just as possible (actually, less so) than dodging every single attack. But oh, I'm sorry.

FutureFight,3bucvh,Sho1va,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:26:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for correcting my typo, a little bit hectic at the moment. Yes, you can also dodge every single hit. As I have stated for the flip side, it's unlikely. No one is right, this is just opinions and we are having a civil conversation as to which is better. I'm sorry you got your panties in a twist over past events. Once again, let go of the past and move on. You seem to be the only one not over it. Grow up."

Honestly he crit a lot before the gear update and keep in mind his passive has a 5 second cooldown and that 1 second stun is more like a ""break"" imo. The update certainly helped and I think he's as good as he ever was, but it's not like he's God tier now lol  I am very happy that they fixed Yondu however and that alone has made Hawkeye more valuable"
FutureFight,3bvb11,Pathogen1991,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:35:35 2015 UTC,"Hawkeye used to be REALLY bad, slower attack speed than Ghost Rider and his feet rooted into the ground on basic attacks.  Plus one of his highest-damaging skills has him run up to the enemy in the most unsafe shoryuken I've ever seen, and doesn't work well for his rotation.  This left a bad taste in my mouth.  Admittedly, the buffs they've added to him, with his movement and attack speed as well as his costume makes him very viable now... it was too little too late for me, since I clear VS9 daily without his help."
FutureFight,3bvb11,lnfidelity,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:46:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.   Having your basic attack, run into melee range and then jump away is pretty laughable.  Run in, get pounded, then jump away.   Maybe if he crits on initial jump in, that would be better and as thus make it worthwhile, but in VS, jumping into a boss and all that ends up doing is getting your ass pounded."

FutureFight,3bvb11,Vexxunite,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:52:35 2015 UTC,"Hawkeye requires you to manually play as he's a ranged/kiting character. Not really someone you'd auto play--which is why a majority of players tend to steer away from him and go for tankier characters like Capt. America, for example.  That being said, with the new crit booster and Hawkeye's uniform bonus--I'd say Hawkeye just became VERY viable in all aspects of the game. The ability to stun every 5 seconds without even having to use a skill, even if its just for 1 second, would be pretty game breaking.   I'm currently working on getting him up to speed."

FutureFight,3bumda,v_iral,3,Thu Jul 2 10:41:13 2015 UTC,"Makes sense thematically, but that would be a very, very special uniform if it changes the character's type, skills, and stats. How much would they price it? And where will the excess bios go?"
FutureFight,3bumda,Spedwards,-4,Thu Jul 2 08:29:52 2015 UTC,Free uniform since the character was basically free to get.  Excess biometrics get converted to Iron Man's.  (I have completely thought this all through).
FutureFight,3bumda,Augmentedforth,2,Thu Jul 2 08:32:55 2015 UTC,"Nooo, let's not do that. I have invested soo much in Hulkbuster, I don't want to see that wasted...unless he gets merged with Iron Man's stats, then I think I'd be ok."
FutureFight,3bumda,Spedwards,-2,Thu Jul 2 07:58:57 2015 UTC,"If it is done, you'd get everything back.  All the gold you spent on upgrades, all the materials used on gear, all the ISO-8 used."

FutureFight,3bumda,Spedwards,0,Thu Jul 2 08:08:21 2015 UTC,"I can't see why someone wouldn't be.  Having an extra character is just a waste in itself. Then you add all the extra gold, materials, and ISO-8 used to upgrade yet another character.    Something I just thought of though, if they can change character class and skills with a uniform, what's stopping them from making ISO-8 sets different as well? For example, Iron Man has a Bloodthirst set but when you change uniform, Hulkbuster has a different set."
FutureFight,3bumda,Ben882,3,Thu Jul 2 08:13:12 2015 UTC,I don't see how that would benefit NM though. A lot of work to reduce a key character to a uniform. I think it generates more crystal spent as flash sales than as a 750 uniform.  Not to mention the impossibility for them to surgically refund crystals spent and drops for 10m players
FutureFight,3bumda,Spedwards,-1,Thu Jul 2 08:22:26 2015 UTC,"If anything, it helps them. Make it a free uniform.  All biometrics upgrading Iron Man are now also upgrading Hulkbuster. Two for the price of one. Good deal.  You don't spend crystals on characters, not directly at least.  Also, it would be incredibly easy to incorporate him as a uniform."
FutureFight,3bumda,hou_f,3,Thu Jul 2 08:29:24 2015 UTC,ISO-8 sets changing with uniforms will require them to change the data structure and I highly doubt any developer would welcome that change lol
FutureFight,3bumda,Spedwards,-3,Thu Jul 2 08:26:32 2015 UTC,"It would take two lines tops. One in their database, and another in their source.  It's probably the easiest part in the process."

FutureFight,3btms4,v_iral,2,Thu Jul 2 02:34:55 2015 UTC,Impressive lineup man Congratz!  I know this seems outta place but can you recommend me some good captain america's series?   How bout the all new cap is it good?
FutureFight,3btms4,knightzeemo,2,Thu Jul 2 01:38:21 2015 UTC,"Everyone will say to start with Brubaker's run. The Winter Soldier is good, no doubt, and it meets Civil War (which leaves a love-hate feeling in most people). So that's a good place to start, but honestly I feel it gets complicated after Civil War (and during) and afterwards there's just too many crossover series to know what's going on. I don't have all the time in the day to research what to read next, so I just don't.   That being said, if you know the basic WWII stories from Cap (he fought Red Skull, died in a plane crash, etc) you can pick up on the 1968 series. It feels more like watching TV episodes. Every book adds something to the grand story, but they can almost always be read independantly of one another. It's just Cap going out and kicking some ass.   As for the new cap, I think Sam Wilson (Falcon) is killing it. In a good way. He isn't perfect -- He throws the shield and misses, or only hits one guy, but he tries and has the same patriotic sense of right and wrong. I didn't like the Mighty Avengers run, because there's this weird thing going on where half the good guys are now bad, and half the bad guys are now good (weird brain switch things, I don't follow it). I didn't like Falcon's debut as Cap be about him mercilessly killing thugs, so I stayed away up to now. Might give it a shot later on. But his Captain America #1 was pretty good, and so far his other stuff has been solid. There's a bit you'd have to know before heading into it, but it's nothing wikipedia can't clear up.   For now, do some Winter Soldier. Dable in Civil War afterward (it's basically Captain's series anyway, but there's a lot of branch-off series that tie in). And if you want, read the old stuff."

I tried Civil War, then Infinity, then the stuff after that, and I just can't keep following it. It's too demanding at this point. There's so much happening in other comics I'm not even reading, but it's assumed by the writers that I know what's going on.   And this new thing? Where 616 is gone and they're trying to rebrand themselves? It's just too... ugh.   I'll stick to reading the 50+ years of comics from the past that I haven't read yet.   Some of the new stuff is good (Thor: God of Thunder, Captain Marvel, New Falcon/America). But I doubt I'll be following the main events anymore. Too confusing."

FutureFight,3btms4,Lanceuppercut47,2,Thu Jul 2 08:09:15 2015 UTC,"Well, in the newer Captain Marvel comics, War Machine (who is now just Iron Patriot all the time) is dating Cap Marvel. So despite his 4-book run ending, he is still IP in the marvel universe. And since they had him do the new paint in the movies, I knew it was a matter of time before he got the uniform.   I'm honestly surprised they made one for Falcon, though. I know he's the current and new Cap A, but Bucky was the captain for a time too, and I thought they'd go with that since most people assume he'll take the mantle if/when they kill off Chris Evans' Cap in the MCU.   I just used Falcon as a main because I like Falcon.. turning him into Cap is only a plus! But I wanted that Iron Patriot armor so bad... I just couldn't ignore War Machine until it came out. I knew I'd regret it if I did."

As in Goblin's first goes from a 112% to 146%.  If that is the case it is still a good thing but not omgwtf gamebreaking like a total damage increase would be.

FutureFight,3buket,NexusKnights,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:49:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's ""bad"" at all. Players like TimTan ($9k+ spent, has more or less everything one could possibly want) do not harm me. On the contrary, they allow us all to play the game in the first place. And I (at VIP 5) do not harm you (assuming you are near F2P). MFF is not a competition.  The real reason NM doesn't just halve the price of crystals is that they probably sell more this way. A limited time offer presses our impulse buy buttons. Meanwhile, players for whom money is no object will still buy exactly as many crystals as they want, so NM gets to make double from them during non-sale periods."
FutureFight,3buket,tegeusCromis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:51:03 2015 UTC,"Im VIP 5 as well. I can see what you mean about impulse on a limited time but all the packs in reality cost the same for $ to crystal ratio. If I could, I would just spam the cheapest pack, however  with the way it is set up people need to spend more money for more crystals as they will need to get larger packs each time. Im guessing thats why they do it."
FutureFight,3buket,NexusKnights,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:01:17 2015 UTC,"Heh, I'm surprised you're so concerned about disparities, then. ;P Nah, seriously, so long as advancement without paying remains as possible as it is now, I don't see the harm in paying players getting more bang for their buck all the time, rather than just during events.  Of course, as we've both pointed out, NM probably makes a lot more money this way. Which is fair enough."

FutureFight,3bskno,HyperColored,7,Wed Jul 1 21:50:21 2015 UTC,I haven't invested in Hulk past the initial 3-star rank but:   skills do not break most skills are slow and leave hulk very vulnerable to hits after the fact big frame and somewhat slow movement - very vulnerable in VS

FutureFight,3bskno,DeadlyInfestus,2,Wed Jul 1 22:44:57 2015 UTC,"Far from it. Completely slow, long animations, low defence and low damage.  Just because he's hard to get does not mean he's good."

FutureFight,3bskno,HyperColored,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:47:28 2015 UTC,Cap with his alternate uniform is worth it so he can tank during missions. He's a defensive stalwart.

But in my view, you can get other combat heroes (like Venom) to be equally effective with much less investment. So I'd say (1) if you go for Cap A, go all-in, and (2) only do this if you really like him as a character or if you really like his ""face tank everything"" play style."

FutureFight,3bskno,carbondusk,-1,Thu Jul 2 04:24:45 2015 UTC,He's not too bad once you get used to his skill set. I just think that he (and Blade) need to get their animation times shortened as that's their only problem.

FutureFight,3bskno,timjenkinss,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:13:44 2015 UTC,Drax I feel will be pretty good at 4/5. I have him at 3 and Fighters of the Galaxy is still a fun team.
FutureFight,3bskno,SageofLogic,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:08:09 2015 UTC,"I'm hopeful but not super optimistic. I rushed him to three stars right away and then found that between his mediocre buff skill and the slight vulnerability lag in his first skill that he basically couldn't do the same job as Luke Cage, to whom he's most similar. I haven't bothered to work him up to 4 though, so perhaps he'll improve there."
FutureFight,3bskno,Extranationalidad,2,Wed Jul 1 22:12:27 2015 UTC,"His 4 and 5* stuff look good on paper and I keep picking him up in Flash Sales with people I want more like Gamora, Angela, and Starlord"
FutureFight,3bskno,SageofLogic,2,Wed Jul 1 22:14:19 2015 UTC,His passive is broken and I'm struggling with trying to explain it to cust support.  5 star skill is similar to his second - good damage PBAoE (plus a stun) but a bit of a windup and will often miss characters that move a lot.
FutureFight,3bskno,toysoldierxiii,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:23:54 2015 UTC,Well that's depressing. I was hoping to be able to run Fighters of the Galaxy because Angela and Gamora are beasts.
FutureFight,3bskno,SageofLogic,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:30:07 2015 UTC,"I still love his basic attack, his buff, and his leadership but yeah the skills are lackluster. Definitely not terrible but not great either. I think getting the passive fixed will help a lot."

FutureFight,3bskno,SageofLogic,2,Wed Jul 1 22:39:54 2015 UTC,"To be fair his buff is unquestionably the second best in the game behind Groot's. 20-25% all defense increase 70+% of the time is no joke, and it triggers attack procs (not a huge deal but occasionally useful) plus a teeny debuff on enemies it hits.  But yes, all four of his skills have a bit of windup and recovery."
FutureFight,3bskno,toysoldierxiii,2,Wed Jul 1 22:28:52 2015 UTC,I think it would be helpful if you list the level and mastery of the hero being reviewed. This would give us a good idea of your experience with the hero and not opinions based off of 1 or 2 star heroes.

FutureFight,3bskno,OCDPandaFace,2,Wed Jul 1 22:38:30 2015 UTC,I'm having trouble thinking of a single other hero who is comparably bad against bosses and who is not considered bad. Got any examples in mind?
FutureFight,3bskno,tegeusCromis,2,Wed Jul 1 22:42:45 2015 UTC,"TBH Ghost Rider is supposed to be one of the strongest heroes ever walked the universe, and so you can see the disappointment here.  His leadership and passive does almost nothing except against himself and destroyer, his basic movement is, I can't even call it average, and his skills are all just average. The contrast between reality and expectation is too big."
FutureFight,3bskno,hou_f,2,Thu Jul 2 07:19:26 2015 UTC,"From characters I put time into, I dislike:  Mockingbird (buff for the 3rd skill sucks, she's also weak and fragile, she really needs stuns)  Elektra (so much windup on her moves and she's paper frail, also needs a stun)  Iron Fist (how is he so slow? one inch punch is awful)  I pretty much dislike anyone who has moves that are long combos but don't cause heavy hit stun/break/stun."
FutureFight,3bskno,SuperShadowStar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:25:03 2015 UTC,"""Terrible"" Class:  Blade (kit is too slow for a melee character)  Punisher (really slow and no flow to his ability animations)  Iron Fist (just glaring holes in his kit for a melee attacker)  Rocket Raccoon (he is like a blast punisher? his kit is just wonky)  ghost rider (get him motorcycle! ill just wait here... god, this chain is so heavy.)  Drax and Yondu (they both suck... just, yeah.)  ""Just, not great"" class:  Falcon (without his uni. spidey, dd, gg, winter soldier, and the ladies are all better speed types)  Black Bolt (his kit just does not combo well, he is awkward to play)  Mockingbird (too many better versions of her in game, use gamora or elektra or widow instead, but she's not ""terrible"")   In my opinion Venom (lot of disagreement from the community, which i love. causes people to reevaluate characters which is a good thing.  I went back and tried playing him differently, and he is a worthy character for villain siege but i wouldn't take him to arena or use him to farm.  He doesn't have a damage immunity, his mastery is fairly useless and no innate hp in his gear.  he's not a tank. i stand by that.  but he can be moved and positioned to get a 3 ability break lock combo on all of the bosses.  because he needs to be positioned like most characters, i wouldn't use him against doc ock, but anyone else he will do well against.)  Bullseye (hes really stationary. hes a squishy turret)"
FutureFight,3bskno,TheDessertFoxx,3,Wed Jul 1 21:40:18 2015 UTC,"I'm totally with you except for Venom, who at 3 stars can regularly take more than 50% off a Destroyer several levels above him and absolutely crush any equally leveled VS boss."
FutureFight,3bskno,Extranationalidad,2,Wed Jul 1 22:05:04 2015 UTC,"yeah, i just... i dont know. i am not feeling him.  he's like ronan without the survivablity and AoE.  I've got a level 40 venom 3* and a level 40+ destroyer wrecks venom. I am not a bad player and i can generally only trust him to knock off about 30%.  His animation times mean he is eating charges and beams when others wouldn't. against a 4* destroyer? maybe 15-20% off.    Bottom line i get more out of other combat characters."
FutureFight,3bskno,TheDessertFoxx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:38:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, you must be using him very incorrectly. I have a level 40 3* Venom and he takes down the level 41 Destroyer by himself. Every one of his skills breaks, and he's fast, so you should never be taking charges or beam hits. The only incoming damage should be meteors and Obliteration Wave, and even those are dodgeable if you're watching the skill clues. When I fail to beat overleveled Destroyers with Venom, it's almost always because I ran out of time, not because I died.  EDIT: Destroyer's entire skill set is telegraphed, so you should almost always know when charges are coming, followed by the beam. As soon as he charges, or the moment that you'd side-stepped the beam, fire off 1-3-2 then run a circle. Don't stay TOO tight to him or you're vulnerable to the stun blast and the big AoE wave."
FutureFight,3bskno,Extranationalidad,2,Thu Jul 2 15:12:03 2015 UTC,I was using him incorrectly. as soon as i stopped thinking of him like a tank (my favorite and best character is luke cage) and used him as a combat dps he started to play a lot better for me.  like anyone you just gotta put him on a bosses hip and then start your ability combo.
FutureFight,3bskno,TheDessertFoxx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:25:51 2015 UTC,"Plus, he's got one good Skill that can pretty much guarantee a Break (the one where he leaps forward), which is very useful for Versus and Siege fights."
FutureFight,3bskno,Marc_Quill,-1,Thu Jul 2 01:12:20 2015 UTC,his charge doesnt connect regularly enough against any even semi mobile enemy and the pause at the start of it begs to be broken.
FutureFight,3bskno,TheDessertFoxx,2,Thu Jul 2 01:33:18 2015 UTC,"Then you're using charge wrong. Use it on enemies that you've already broken or who are in the middle of a skill (like a beam, for instance) or who are charging up a skill with a bigger wind-up than Venom's.  Venom needs a bit of thought, but that doesn't make him bad."
FutureFight,3bskno,tegeusCromis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:25:16 2015 UTC,"Just specifically in arena i still wouldnt use him.  Luke, HB, and even Cap A with uni will shrug his stuff and break lock him in return.  His lack of a damage immunity hurts him there. I revisited him in siege and he is decent. If you put him on any boss with a beam attacks hip he will punish them for it. Can do plenty of damage and specifically his auto attack has a VERY high dps to it."
FutureFight,3bskno,TheDessertFoxx,2,Mon Jul 6 01:28:55 2015 UTC,In my opinion Venom (slow and his abilities immobilize him. he doesnt bring anything that a character with a better kit doesnt already have.)   Venom is pretty unanimously considered one of the best Combat characters. D:
FutureFight,3bskno,lnfidelity,0,Wed Jul 1 22:04:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah i've gone into it on other threads. His attack is slow and pushes which causes some positioning issues, he is stationary for the entirety of two of his abilities and pauses before his charge, he doesnt have a useful defensive passive, his team up assist whiffs too often to be relied on.   His almost saving grace is his 5 star because a cc is what he lacks. unfortunately it is a cc that causes the target to wander around and his ability targeting locks onto where he is pointed and not the target.  Venom is outclassed by at least 3 other combat characters at 4* and most of them at 5+  i LOVE seeing venom on an arena team against me."
FutureFight,3bskno,TheDessertFoxx,2,Thu Jul 2 01:31:20 2015 UTC,"His skills seamlessly chain into each other, are incredibly safe (especially considering his damage and bulkiness), and Fear works really well if you know what you're doing.  Even aside from his absurdly high damage and sturdy stats.  I feel like you're just not using the character properly, because his kit of skills is one of the best in the game."
FutureFight,3bskno,lnfidelity,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:45:58 2015 UTC,"more power to you man.  i use him for villain siege.  if i had his fear i'd use it then his 3*, then charge, and then his second ability. that would probably combo well.    but a five star venom is pretty low on my list of biometrics to farm and at 3- 4 stars getting off the first break on a boss with venom gets him hit every time. He's not THAT sturdy.  I dont know, to each their own.  I'd just suggest other combat types to the OP."
FutureFight,3bskno,TheDessertFoxx,2,Thu Jul 2 02:16:22 2015 UTC,"I start every combo with his Tendril attack. That attack on its own can be used to kite indefinitely, and is a guaranteed Break.  Tendril into Charge, Fear into little spirit things. Tendril into Charge into spirit things without Fear. Or just run around and Tendril all day."

Venom - Luke Cage, Black Panther, Hulkbuster, (maybe hulk) Rocket - Malekith, Star Lord, War Machine, Iron Man, Red Skull, and I think Modok"
FutureFight,3bskno,TheDessertFoxx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:27:05 2015 UTC,"Venom > Cage, and HB  Rocket > SL, IM, RS, and MODOK  Also, you judge them on their own quality and now whether or not some other characters may be better."
FutureFight,3bskno,Thesparkone,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:35:40 2015 UTC,I get your point. I would recommend that players avoid investing in them until other characters who are better are built up.
FutureFight,3bskno,TheDessertFoxx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:58:15 2015 UTC,"That's a tall order when it comes to Venom. Good luck getting BP ranked up before Venom. Same for Hulk and Hulkbuster—that is, if they were actually better than Venom. Which they aren't."
FutureFight,3bskno,tegeusCromis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:39:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Hulk and venom are about equal now that ive looked into them more.  HB's passive and luke's mastery put them ahead and BP rift farming is indeed a pain in the ass, but his ranged break and daggers abilities put him ahead of venom for me."
FutureFight,3bskno,TheDessertFoxx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:31:11 2015 UTC,"I agree that Venom deserves his popularity. I'd place only Black Panther above him and Nebula tied.  I really disagree that Rocket > MODOK, though. MODOK is a beast. The chair blast-off is awkward, yeah, but the power and safety of stun --> basic attacks --> skill 3 shouldn't be underestimated. Against some enemies, you can fit the blast-off in after skill 3, too."
FutureFight,3bskno,tegeusCromis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:37:57 2015 UTC,"Rocket is safer, does more damage, and is probably a decent bit faster now. You can start off with MODOK's chair attack on Doc Ock's stage, but you have to be more careful with him. His 3rd skill can pinball you into the lasers. Though, I wonder what MODOK can do with the new Mind Damage booster, but doesn't he only have 1 Mind attack before 5*?"
FutureFight,3bskno,Thesparkone,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:20:53 2015 UTC,"I haven't played post-patch Rocket; maybe that will change my mind. But before this, I preferred MODOK by a large margin for his anti-Bullseye utility. The long stun plus hit stun from the pinball attack mean Bullseye rarely gets to even try to attack you. Safest blast hero after Malekith, Vision and WM. (Which, yeah, is three heroes, but they're three of the very best heroes in the game, so I don't hold that against MODOK.) I don't like him so much against Ock for the reason you stated."
FutureFight,3bskno,tegeusCromis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:27:54 2015 UTC,"For Mockingbird, I would only say level her up if you are running ""SHIELD Divas"". She's not bad when paired with Widow and Sharon. But she's not very good in other team combos."

As of now, these are the only three colours ive seen on special gear and unless netmarble decides to release more tiers, which provide higher % than the already insane numbers and break the game.

FutureFight,3bswes,Spedwards,2,Wed Jul 1 21:54:17 2015 UTC,"I hope they double the amount of siege waves personally!  It's free bios, no energy cost and you don't lose anything other than time."
FutureFight,3bswes,Lanceuppercut47,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:40:05 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm so far away from that. I do have a few key characters lacking, such as War Machine, Kingpin, and Daredevil. I suppose they could help. I have so many 1 stars I've just completely neglected since I don't have energy everyday to farm them. I may only be 52/160 for Ultron but I'd still rather do his missions than say Green Goblin, even though I'd like to rank him up. It's frustrating."
FutureFight,3bswes,Spedwards,2,Wed Jul 1 22:18:16 2015 UTC,"At the moment, after I got my main 3 characters maxed, I would run 1 of my mains, with 2 characters. When the first character hit Lv40, I'd replace him with the 2nd character and add another one to the team. If you don't use clear tickets and use this team for all your daily runs, characters will start levelling up quickly.  Ranking them up can be an issue. I only have enough energy to farm 8 character's biometrics daily (3 of which only have 1 mission). Whenever I can though I'll get biometrics for my lowest ranked characters."

Typically, that meant getting everyone universally to 2-star, then 3-star, etc.   With every character at 3-star, low to mid-30s, you should finish off Villain Siege, then can go do whatever you want."

FutureFight,3btj9m,tegeusCromis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:56:55 2015 UTC,I have a feeling they will change the percentage stat boosts in some way soon. I can't imagine a character having 50% dodge or crit rate to be intentional. I may be wrong though.
FutureFight,3btj9m,-Harute-,2,Thu Jul 2 01:01:20 2015 UTC,Even a 50% crit rate is still only 50% chance to hit for what 25% more? The new damage boosters are 100% chance to hit for 50% more damage.  Crit isn't double it's barely 20%+ more
FutureFight,3btj9m,Sho1va,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:11:17 2015 UTC,"Even if that's the case for critical hits (which is still a bit much IMO), what about dodge? 50% chance to take no damage just doesn't seem right."
FutureFight,3btj9m,-Harute-,2,Thu Jul 2 01:23:00 2015 UTC,I just got a level 5 dodge item it's 32% not 50

FutureFight,3btj9m,Sho1va,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:18:04 2015 UTC,"I might try to get one of those and run him with DD lead, and BB for even more dodge. It will be awesome :D."

FutureFight,3bsmez,Moozie76,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:42:48 2015 UTC,"that is correct, but then they would technically change timezones.  Arizona for instance doesn't do daylight savings time, they move between pacific and mountain time.  As I said, no one in the US is on standard time right now. Arizona should be on Pacific Daylight time, and in fall they go to Mountain standard time.  EDIT: I just did some more research, and according to dateandtime.com, arizona is technically listed as being on MST, which right now is the exact same thing as PDT. it is 2:50pm MST in phoenix and 2:50 PDT in Los angeles. I have never heard of them sticking with the MST, i have always seen them switch timezones. So I stand corrected, but my original point is it is easier for most people to just say eastern time, and let the people in places that don't follow DST to figure it out."

FutureFight,3brlxy,mistermeh,3,Wed Jul 1 16:15:00 2015 UTC,Might get fixed before the maintenance in a few hours.  Report it to Netmarble though just to make sure.  However I have seen a bunch of people using Iron Patriot so they don't seem to be having the problem.
FutureFight,3brlxy,Spedwards,2,Wed Jul 1 16:19:11 2015 UTC,I can't get to their website at work. Can I report through the game interface somehow?

FutureFight,3brlxy,DrEntly,4,Wed Jul 1 16:47:40 2015 UTC,What. Are we supposed to work?
FutureFight,3brlxy,Zephyraine,2,Wed Jul 1 16:53:54 2015 UTC,"if you goto the mobirum official form, this has already been posted by the devs, they are working on a fix. Should happen with the maintenance  http://www.mobirum.com/article/detail?cafeId=futurefight_en&bbsId=75&id=10787"
FutureFight,3bpygn,Scar_Stream,11,Wed Jul 1 05:18:11 2015 UTC,Hopefully the next update addresses dimensional rifts.   I would like to see either a cost reduction and/or take out the rising cost upon using a stage. Plus maybe rotate some characters out and add in new ones.
FutureFight,3bpygn,Syllogistic_Panda,2,Wed Jul 1 07:31:39 2015 UTC,"Recent updates gave us a new dropable in rift, special gear."
FutureFight,3bpygn,mnmuhaimin,2,Wed Jul 1 19:30:33 2015 UTC,"Yea, I saw that, which isn't too bad, it adds at least another incentive to run rifts, even if the costs aren't changed.   Definitely going to be on the hunt for rifts after the patch."
FutureFight,3bpygn,Syllogistic_Panda,9,Wed Jul 1 19:33:04 2015 UTC,"Or, they should just lower the energy cost. Make it like Special Missions."
FutureFight,3bpygn,Thesparkone,7,Wed Jul 1 06:28:21 2015 UTC,Yes especially after the launch of special missions it's like NM is trying to discourage us from running rifts.
FutureFight,3bpygn,hou_f,6,Wed Jul 1 08:32:00 2015 UTC,Agreed. I always run rifts on stage 1 for the Dimension Debris and bios are just a bonus. I only farm them aggressively for bios if I'm close to a rank up.
FutureFight,3bpygn,Gpaint,2,Wed Jul 1 05:52:53 2015 UTC,Same.
FutureFight,3bpygn,IKADIXA,3,Wed Jul 1 07:52:13 2015 UTC,Even though I am new I find the drop rate just okay even though I am still at the lower stages but what I find not okay is the cost of energy for the successive runs. It is just too much.
FutureFight,3bpygn,CountHalphas,2,Wed Jul 1 08:18:33 2015 UTC,This is why my rift heroes doesnt rank up. I Dont want to waste too much energy for those debris.
FutureFight,3bpygn,Bulilitrawr,2,Wed Jul 1 10:41:42 2015 UTC,...And now we're forced to do these energy sinks for the new special gear. Great.
FutureFight,3bpygn,kaige,4,Wed Jul 1 11:21:05 2015 UTC,"Apparently, this post touched a nerve for someone. Downvotes for everyone it looks like."
FutureFight,3bpygn,Augmentedforth,2,Wed Jul 1 07:10:26 2015 UTC,"I dont think its more of the touching a nerve more like a complaint that is rather common. ""This sucks blah blah I do alot of missions I get nothing or JUST one and i want this or that to change"".   Most of the comments here are ""yeah I like it too."" Which doesnt add that much, Its like commenting ""THIS"" on someones comment. Why comment 'THIS' when you can just upvote for visibility or add something?   Also I kind of agree with OP but change a few things around like using energy and topping it at 1 everytime but maybe lower some of the original cost at the start.   P.S Some of the downvotes are uncalled for but thats the case for Reddit in general."

FutureFight,3bt8xg,Pedruska,3,Wed Jul 1 23:25:47 2015 UTC,He's not too bad once you get used to his skill set. I just think that he (and Blade) need to get their animation times shortened as that's their only problem.
FutureFight,3bt8xg,Spedwards,2,Thu Jul 2 00:19:40 2015 UTC,"except if he's not the worst character, someone else will be. You can't just continuously buff the worst characters because there's no point to it."

FutureFight,3bsd6u,tegeusCromis,2,Wed Jul 1 19:43:50 2015 UTC,"Not really. Just tried it. Didn't work.  What we do know is that if you force quit the game before using up all 10 (invisible) charges of best condition, the charges reset to 10 again. Do this and you need never lose best condition!"

FutureFight,3bqh42,xerxes3117,2,Wed Jul 1 10:02:12 2015 UTC,What's being implied is that everyone will equip web resist gear thus weakening Spider-Man's skill set.
FutureFight,3bqh42,Lanceuppercut47,2,Wed Jul 1 10:20:17 2015 UTC,yup and there'll be other resists too which will weaken other heroes ... but yeah spiderman gets affected the most cuz he needs webs almost everytime for his combo
FutureFight,3bqh42,xerxes3117,5,Wed Jul 1 10:27:21 2015 UTC,"There is the GR specific fire boost, hahaha, good one Netmarble!"

FutureFight,3bqh42,tegeusCromis,3,Wed Jul 1 10:58:25 2015 UTC,yea well said .... thats where netmarble did a right thing ... you cannot unequip special gears .... so that would be like just wasting the slot for spidey only .... also i think the special gear won't be very easy to get
FutureFight,3bqh42,xerxes3117,2,Wed Jul 1 11:54:48 2015 UTC,Am assuming you can simply overwrite a new one in there like how ISO works..
FutureFight,3bqh42,Lanceuppercut47,2,Wed Jul 1 14:25:29 2015 UTC,"No need to assume. It's stated right in the news post:   Once you equip special gear you won't be able to return to the previous state. If you change it to other special equipment option, the previous one will vanish."
FutureFight,3bqh42,tegeusCromis,3,Wed Jul 1 15:57:46 2015 UTC,hope that doesn't make him OP :D
FutureFight,3bqh42,xerxes3117,2,Wed Jul 1 11:55:12 2015 UTC,I doubt it'll be on everyone. It's actually a waste. Spiderman can easily be defeated now without web resist. Putting that on your characters basically limits your special gear to only arena. Id much rather use a gear that helps with all phases of the game. Not one I can play 10-15 times a day

FutureFight,3bqh42,Spedwards,2,Wed Jul 1 13:22:46 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, still very strong. I would mostly be okay if there was an equivalent that boosted physical or energy damage by 10%, to negate that effect."
FutureFight,3bqh42,lnfidelity,2,Wed Jul 1 15:43:15 2015 UTC,"Probably would be though it doesn't negate it (not exactly at least).  10k damage + 10% = 11k.  10% off 11k is 1,100 so 9,900 damage.  900 damage difference."

It sounds like a lot but compared to a specific boost such as war machine's leadership, he gives a 30% boost to physical attack. I know the draw back of that is anyone who is a energy attacker doesn't get the leadership boost but it's all about balance."
FutureFight,3br4v3,tegeusCromis,3,Fri Jul 3 13:02:51 2015 UTC,"A difference of 6% is significant, but 24% is still a lot. Anyway, I'm not saying Punisher's leadership is top-tier, but we're comparing it to Blade's here, not WM's. If Blade's leadership ""makes him usable"", so does Punisher's."
FutureFight,3br4v3,ign-Dextr0,3,Fri Jul 3 13:19:29 2015 UTC,"great for early game, starts to wane in late mid, mostly because he has only 2 skills until 5 *  mine is at 4 * lvl 37, i think he's ideal leader of EoK team.  he starts out slow, but now that i have +10 atck / mvmt speed on his gear, he can keep up quite well  phenomenal mob clear, both skils can hit up to 12 - 15 targets, so you can kite with spidey run speed, switch boom boom like a shotty  regular attack not very reliable, but skills damage are decent, blind will usually be too brief to make any difference, since late game characters will have some crowd control stats   his gear has two native speed buff, he starts out slow, but not that slow once you gear him +5 and up  imo a great character design with respectable strength and weakness"
FutureFight,3br4v3,y2fitzy,2,Wed Jul 1 16:44:05 2015 UTC,"I only have him at 2 stars, but he's easily the most disappointing character I've played with. So slow, doesn't seem to do a lot of damage (though that may be because he dies so damn quickly in VS)  I want him to be so much better"
FutureFight,3br4v3,TheDessertFoxx,2,Wed Jul 1 15:23:41 2015 UTC,He is acceptable at clearing and is nice when teaming in.  His kit is methodical and you spend more time positioning him than you do damaging and the pay out feels small when you do.
FutureFight,3br4v3,Ben882,2,Wed Jul 1 21:46:47 2015 UTC,"He's slow, not the best and all but he is a different kind of badass. Blasting ninjas at close range with a grenade launcher is its own reward and you forget how unefficient he is."
FutureFight,3br4v3,Shansation,2,Thu Jul 2 07:30:37 2015 UTC,"I have a Punisher at level 45... He was pretty awful in the beginning and still not the most amazing of my characters but serviceable. His animations and attack effects look awesome, but slow speed and above average special damage (and only 3 offensive skills) stops him from being great.  He can usually take down or heavily damage a high level VS villain (stage 7 or 8 (Doc Oct, Destroyer, Ronan). For the destroyer his slow run speeds makes getting out of the way of some attacks (especially the PBAOE one) inconvenient.  His burst damage is respectable but not particularly high, even with the buff on. (the lack of a 4th attack power hurts him in this department). 2 of his specials push him backwards when firing, which usually helps him get out of the way of beams and attacks but can occasionally throw your into attacks that you don't wanna get into.  Attack animations are kinda slow as well, even with his equipment all 9++. His play style best suits a ""slow kite and make 1"" attack type play, ""lure a boss attack out, side step and make make 1 attack"". So move make 1 basic attack, then move again, try not to be greedy.  He does okay for Villain Siege and PvE, haven't had much experience with him in Arena. Wish his damage/Cooldown was faster to make up for his lack of damage or Raise the damage to make up for the lower number of specials/slow attack speed."
FutureFight,3br4v3,Lanceuppercut47,2,Fri Jul 3 03:00:54 2015 UTC,"Slooow!    Not current RR slow but he's semi useful against early level Destroyers, maybe up to about 3-4 possibly?"

Sort of Ronan-esque in that regard - not good but makes others so much better he is worth the spot."
FutureFight,3br4v3,Thesparkone,2,Wed Jul 1 14:27:07 2015 UTC,"Eh, Ronan has 3 really good skills at 3*. Punisher? Not so much. I don't see the comparison at all."
FutureFight,3br4v3,toysoldierxiii,-1,Wed Jul 1 15:44:02 2015 UTC,"Standard beam, stupidly slow and telegraphed average damage swing, and slow and telegraphed average damage bubble which has knockback and fear - the two worst statuses for a slow melee character. No, I would not call Ronan's skills ""good"" for anything but overleveled (to make sure of one-shots) mob clearing."
FutureFight,3br4v3,Gpaint,2,Wed Jul 1 16:33:55 2015 UTC,"sooooooooo clear you have not put much into Ronan, if at all. For anyone that reads this I promise you Ronan is top tier and nothing like described here. When you first get Ronan he will feel like weaksauce but once he has his 4 skills he is a force to be reckoned with. Vision and Ultron have become benchwarmers and Ronan pulls all the weight in Arena, VS, and Missions.   Call me Bias but Ronan was every bit as good as we all hoped for when seeing his leadership"
FutureFight,3br4v3,Thesparkone,2,Fri Jul 3 06:03:38 2015 UTC,"Huh? The beam isn't slow at all, and it's pretty safe for me against bosses. Then, he has a nice AoE that causes fear, and his hammer swing has knockback. You don't even have to wait and counter with him, and he's not that slow. I'm not sure why you're trying to make all of his skills sound as worse as possible. And, you want to compare him to some super slow guy who just stands there throwing grenades while being vulnerable and his 3rd skill is just a small boost to his attack?   I'm not sure how you're using Ronan, but it doesn't sound like you're using him very well."

FutureFight,3br4v3,DrEntly,3,Wed Jul 1 18:20:44 2015 UTC,"BEAM is the only thing that misses while they run in fear.   Ronan turns with each strike if necessary. Can't say i have had this ""missing"" problem."
FutureFight,3br4v3,toysoldierxiii,0,Wed Jul 1 18:37:31 2015 UTC,"I never said the beam was slow, nor did I make the claim that the two were the exact same. I said:   Sort of Ronan-esque in that regard - not good but makes others so much better he is worth the spot.   And I stand by it. On their own they are both mediocre AT BEST but have traits that makes them desirable in teams.  And yes, knock back and fear are indeed terrible on a super slow melee character. He wastes too much time re-positioning."
FutureFight,3br4v3,tegeusCromis,2,Wed Jul 1 18:12:53 2015 UTC,"Are we talking about story bosses? VS? Arena? Some context would be nice. I happen to find Ronan to be good at all of these, but the way you use him has to change depending on which. I   Anyway, relating all this back to Punisher, the difference—even accepting that you're right about Ronan's skills being awkward—is that Ronan's skill rotation at 3* does a ton of damage. Punisher's? Not so much."
FutureFight,3br4v3,toysoldierxiii,0,Wed Jul 1 18:38:54 2015 UTC,"So you would put Ronan in the A-tier or S-Tier in all modes? I can't see that and would love to see him handle BE or Doc equal level solo, I'd love to see him solo some of the late 7 elites at 40, and I would love to see him even take a full auto 1 for 1 in the arena without his leadership in play.  Until I see that I stand by my original assessment of B-Tier plus, just like Punisher - can't carry a team individually but has traits that can push others higher (leadership and teams)."
FutureFight,3br4v3,tegeusCromis,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:15:50 2015 UTC,I'd love to continue this conversation but I think Spedwards might get annoyed at us. ;) Maybe a thread on Ronan's power level as an individual hero is in order?
FutureFight,3br4v3,Gpaint,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:38:40 2015 UTC,Ronan can clear on auto all of these mentioned and much more. He CAN do it without his leadership but I don't see why gimping him would make him appear better in your eyes? If a hero has an excellent leadership skill it would be foolish not to use it.
FutureFight,3br4v3,LingWong,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:07:22 2015 UTC,"i see alot of ppl saying he is bad, and they have him at 2 and 3 stars lol, ppl give up on him because his 3rd skill is a buff, and a good one at that. I have him at 5* 10+ gear 25+ skills with bloodthirsty set and with his passive he doesnt have time to auto cause theres always a skill thats off cd. I dont even have leader skill 5 yet only 3 and havent rerolled gear yet unless it was energy damage, so he's still just gonna get better ...So 3rd skill is a buff with first and second being really good. There are heroes with 3 skills at 3* and those skills are meh Ill give you the slow thing but im gonna try to reroll fix that[rant over]"
FutureFight,3br4v3,Extranationalidad,3,Thu Jul 2 17:38:52 2015 UTC,"Your rant doesn't actually say anything good about him though. All that you said in that entire paragraph is that you've invested in gears and skills, and correctly identified the fact that he has a buff skill at 3 stars."
FutureFight,3br4v3,Zephyraine,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:37:19 2015 UTC,"Yea...I don't think you even like Punisher yourself. Even with the investments that you made, you didnt even finish investing in him all the way which probably mean you're not that impressed by his potential or just plain not interested in maining him. Or you're just lying about 5* because you didnt even MENTION his 4th skill, something which usually is the last chance for a character to be decent.   All you said is this: you think the first 2 skills are good albeit slow, third skill is good, and that you geared him to 10 and above, skills lv 25 and halfway mastery. That's not exactly the best sales pitch in place where you're supposed to be boasting about the advantages of the character. I mean EVERYONE is saying that his first 2 skills are slow and the buff skill isn't worth it while you counter and just say that it is really good. So why exactly is it good? You never even mentioned the reason.   For the record, you CAN'T re-roll fix a slow attack. Even if you do stack Attack Speed stats, it's not gonna make Punisher go super fast or attack faster. The slow part of him is inherent and the only way it's gonna get better is if the dev's give him a buff in attack speed. So saying that you're gonna re-roll fix that just seems like a waste of gold because you're essentially trying to make his attack speed go from snail speed to slug speed."

FutureFight,3bs5ye,swingking8,3,Wed Jul 1 21:00:23 2015 UTC,"How is he locking himself in? You should, at a minimum, get enough 1-star ISO in a week to give his main three their default set and get the boosted damage/defense from it. Just change it later. At Lv30, he has four slots, so he can even have some flexibility with the slots.  I added 2-star ISO to all 45 characters to give them their default set at the minimum. Then adjust accordingly as I got resources."

Since, i suck at grinding xp i would just do a long term battle using a low lvl than short term using a high lvl. I dont trust the chain of rage and 3 slash due to some of the enemies can attack even their flinched. For example, i use rage on bullseye then i 3 slash him. While im performing my slashes he can slash me back which really hurts. The leap attack sucks so much because of its slow animation, low damage, and no breaks"

Yes you could easily farm the Ronan bios but it doesn't mean you're paying 1100 crystals for 50 Malekith bios.    You spent 550 crystals to save yourself 2-3 days worth of spam farming Ronan. Now you can use that energy saved to farm other bios or hey guess what? Farm Ronan bios anyway because now you're already 50 bios closer to next rank than you were before.

Assuming they can complete 12 speed clears at level 40 in the 30 min no limit time frame that's potentially 24 runs plus the 10 daily limit.     So, if they're lucky enough to get a drop on every single run then that's 34 bios in a day.    For those with 5* now it's possible that all they've done since GotG patch is just farm Ronan non stop. That's some serious dedication though."
FutureFight,3bpkr4,hoju83,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:36:17 2015 UTC,I do each level 40 run in 1:35 - 1:50 mostly on auto. Just move the characters when they're stuck in a slow field. Usually a level 40 leader that's helping two level 30+ strikers to level up.   About halfway to 5* and that's with missing quite a few days. I get 20 bios a day quite easily.
FutureFight,3bpkr4,dtwn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:11:49 2015 UTC,Ok after reading this I tried it out myself and managed to get 32 total runs in (10 daily and 22 from 2 no limits). Running level 40 I ended up with 25 bios so 50 in 2 days is definitely doable.

FutureFight,3bpkr4,tegeusCromis,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:00:05 2015 UTC,Your perspective is valid but doesn't make your initial comment any less wrong. To say that this deal is like paying 1100 crystals for 50 Malekith bios is the same as saying that 50 Ronan bios (and the little extras in the package) are worth nothing to you. Obviously they are not valueless; they just aren't something you personally would spend premium currency on.
FutureFight,3bpkr4,Kinrubich,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:57:07 2015 UTC,lol. malekith's bio is hard to get. even i just need 10 to 4. i bought the rare 100 malekith bio that flashed. haha now i am so tempted to push 5 since im almost halfway. haha  though i only planned to stay at 4* :D

At my current rate, I won't get to that level for at least another 4 years.  $9,107 sounds like a kid that has a bunch of money handed to him for whatever reason, an adult in the same boat (gogo trust fund), or a successful adult with lots of disposable income."

FutureFight,3bqtxf,Spedwards,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:36:17 2015 UTC,So is the impressive thing supposed to be that this is done on Auto? Because finishing the game should be possible with high-end 3-star and definitely 4-star with most characters. Some of the crappier characters will need the stat boost and extra attack from 5-star.
FutureFight,3bqtxf,lnfidelity,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:08:57 2015 UTC,"I think so. Auto and he didn't switch characters at all, although using the team up attack and an assist was a negative I think.

FutureFight,3bpztw,Gpaint,5,Wed Jul 1 05:32:26 2015 UTC,"Can't say whether its worthwhile or worthless definitively, but i think attack speed only affects basic attacks and not skills. If that is true, you're sacrificing possible attack damage (which also improves skill damage) for attack speed."

FutureFight,3bnio5,KenzouKurosaki,3,Tue Jun 30 20:36:02 2015 UTC,New Falcon is SO GOOD. They fixed his raptor strike so he doesn't spin past enemies. His shield toss has been upgraded from caps mediocre toss. Replace vertical descent with shield toss and swoop does extra damage and instead of shooting guns he shoots these vibranium bat looking things. And the 25% rate attack is a red vibrantium bat that flies through an enemy. He attacks hard and fast. Massive upgrade. Gonna buy patriot and visions uniforms and really rock Avengers Assemble
FutureFight,3bnio5,Youndu4You,2,Tue Jun 30 21:11:12 2015 UTC,Sounds awesome! That being said I hope buying a uniform doesn't become the standard way of fixing mediocre heroes. I hope sometimes they just improve bad skills :-)

Time and time again she would team up with Spider-Man. If someone like Venom can get a Spider-Man team-up, Black Cat should as well.

FutureFight,3bn02o,Vexxunite,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:18:11 2015 UTC,What do you mean it doesn't suit him? It's the costume directly from the comics. And his costume is EASILY one of the more detailed Captain America costumes.
FutureFight,3bn02o,germost,2,Tue Jun 30 15:28:49 2015 UTC,"Despite all that being true, one could quite reasonably think the costume still doesn't suit him. :P I find it kinda goofy myself."

FutureFight,3bn02o,germost,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:36:04 2015 UTC,It looks weird. The shield (wich he doesn’t use anyway) looks like a paper version of cap's shield. And as i stated before. I don't really care for Falcon in general... maybe why I don't really like his costume.
FutureFight,3bn02o,Vexxunite,3,Tue Jun 30 15:37:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with the shield, it looks a little weird, but he does use it for the shield toss skill.

FutureFight,3bop9x,Gpaint,4,Tue Jun 30 22:30:32 2015 UTC,To achieve the feeling of floating head of doom I recommend 3* minimum for maximum effect

FutureFight,3bop9x,Bootshine,4,Tue Jun 30 23:26:23 2015 UTC,"His 3* skill is ridiculously good with such a low cooldown and the invincibility, and he obviously has the best blast leadership in the game. His second skill isnt all that good, but I think the first serves its purpose. Plus I like his teams."
FutureFight,3bop9x,ssj4ric,3,Tue Jun 30 23:47:37 2015 UTC,"I agree, the first skill is actually rather good. It is a ranged large-area AoE that does decent damage, not over-long animation, AND most importantly has a guaranteed break on it. Makes it rather useful in multiple situations. The third skill is still his best pre-5 stars, though."
FutureFight,3bop9x,eyeseeyoo,3,Wed Jul 1 00:13:49 2015 UTC,The built-in strafe moves on the 3* skill also actually make him a half-decent auto-play blast character.  Much less bloodtanking with autoattacks... looking at you Iron Man...

And added stun effect for Armored Clash as the only additional bonus to the costume? It's like Warmachines costume totally got shafted when compared to Falcon's bonuses. Anyone who plays WarMachine will probably know that Armored Clash is already a safe skill that breaks the opponent upon hit. In addition to that, we usually follow up the Armored Clash skill with supressing fire, which hitstuns the enemy as well. Stun really isnt needed."
FutureFight,3bmh5q,tegeusCromis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:44:23 2015 UTC,"I'm glad. WM's skills are perfect as they are. I'm perfectly happy to get a nice skin, some stats, and hopefully a cool passive."
FutureFight,3bmh5q,Zephyraine,2,Tue Jun 30 12:48:46 2015 UTC,"He technically only get more stats. Falcon gets like 3 bonuses along with 2 new skills. Warmachine gets 1 bonus that is redundant.   I know i seem like I'm nitpicking but its only because Warmachine is my main and seeing his costume getting shafted compared to Falcon is a little depressing.  EDIT: Sorry I'm blind, Falcon gets 1 bonus that activates based on ratio. But still more than WM's costume."
FutureFight,3bmh5q,SageofLogic,4,Tue Jun 30 12:51:54 2015 UTC,To be fair Falcon NEEDS everything he can get and Warmachine is already a super solid character.
FutureFight,3bmh5q,tegeusCromis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:14:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, just realised the video showed the bonus. (And totally missed the bit of your post above explaining it. Oops. Perils of posting on the go.) Hmm. I see your point re: redundancy, but a couple of extra basic attacks while stunned could be nice to add into the rotation.  To each their own. I main WM too and I'm happy with what we're getting. I'm fine with Falcon getting a bigger boost. Lord knows he needs it."
FutureFight,3bmh5q,Zephyraine,0,Tue Jun 30 13:07:07 2015 UTC,"Actually you made me realise that his whole rotation requires changing with the costume. Armored Clash -> Supressing Fire will be a wasted rotation since the Stun effect will be wasted due to Supressing fire already doing hitstun. Essentially it's either using Armored Clash as the last skill in the rotation to finish up with basic attacks, or go Armored CLash -> a few basic punches - > Supressing Fire  EDIT: Don't you think that swapping the Costume Bonus for Falcon and WM around would benefit each other better? Falcon's + Phys Attk boost activation based on 25% ratio while attacking bonus is better for WM since he has Supressing Fire and Beam attacks that can Proc ratio stuff like crazy. Falcon on the other hand has alot of single hit skills, in which having extra Stun on those attacks will help him more."
FutureFight,3bmh5q,tegeusCromis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:15:08 2015 UTC,"Yup. Detracts a bit from the combo's elegance, but should be quite effective. I like the VS implications: you don't always want to dump your whole combo on Doc Ock at one go, so the option to go clash --> basics could be handy.  Swapping the bonuses around would probably be a bit too awesome for WM! I fear humanity was not meant to wield such power....."

FutureFight,3bnnjr,arykmax,4,Tue Jun 30 19:01:48 2015 UTC,"I suspect they'll simply add the missions. First, if they retain a single special mission quota of 10 entries per day, players will still be forced to choose. Want to farm Ronan all day erryday! Then you're not going to be able to get any Ant-Man bios. There's still that temptation to use crystals. Secondly, they went through a fair bit of trouble to create that campaign content. I doubt they will cast it aside so readily."
FutureFight,3bnnjr,tegeusCromis,2,Tue Jun 30 19:40:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would be rather strange for them to put all that effort into all of the new mob models and animation, plus all of the art and coding that went into the level design, and then throw it all away after a month or two.   I am guessing they will just add on new Special missions and keep the old ones each time they add new content. As you said, though, they also probably won't increase the 10 entries a day, which means eventually it is going to be very difficult to choose who to farm."

FutureFight,3bnnjr,cannonmax,2,Tue Jun 30 20:19:35 2015 UTC,"I predict that the 4 characters of these 5 characters to appear in the game: Ant-Man, Wasp, Yellowjack, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Here's why...  The original Kree-Skrull War involved Captain Mar-Vell (the original male version that died of cancer) and the Avengers, when Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, Wasp and Goliath (aka Ant-Man) were part of the team. If I remember correctly, Rick Jones was also part of the storyline but I don't foresee him being added right now. Annibus was part of the storyline, but he's probably tied up into the FF properties so I doubt he'll appear in the game. I can see Ronan popping up as a boss in Kree-Skrull War missions.  If they are sticking with the movie tie-in, I think Yellow Jacket stays and Wasp is dropped. If they are sticking to the Kree-Skrull War storyline, they drop Yellow Jacket and keep Wasp."

FutureFight,3bnq16,MegaMohsi,4,Tue Jun 30 18:15:03 2015 UTC,The problem is if they replace the special missions there's a whole bunch of characters behind a paywall.
FutureFight,3bnq16,rhysappa12,3,Tue Jun 30 18:11:03 2015 UTC,I don't think they'd do that to that many characters at once. Especially with how popular Ronan is and with how many team bonuses Drax is in.
FutureFight,3bnq16,SageofLogic,3,Tue Jun 30 18:55:52 2015 UTC,"Sadly while this is my biggest fear right now, I think that's the route they will take.  Increases demand for crystals and makes GotG flash sales valuable.  Lets hope for a chapter tab.  There is enough paywall content already."
FutureFight,3bnq16,cbarbera,2,Tue Jun 30 19:01:30 2015 UTC,On a side note I've calculated that if I farm Ronan hard and get a minimum of 15 bios a day I should have him at 6 stars right before the movie drops.
FutureFight,3bnq16,cbarbera,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:03:02 2015 UTC,"It's not as simple as ""remove farming; increase crystal demand; profit"". They need to give us enough to keep us hooked, and they know it. That's why there are always some accessible heroes and some ""chase"" heroes, like Malekith and (to a lesser extent) Gamora. I think they will keep the normal GotG heroes accessible in order to keep people playing."

FutureFight,3bnq16,ign-Dextr0,2,Tue Jun 30 20:10:13 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence on this one.  One the 1 hand, getting rid of, or swapping the special missions makes sense, that way people aren't overwhelmed with stuff they need to do with their energy.  And then swapping the special missions every week or 2 to make farming the toon you want to farm feel more necessary.  Sucks this way, but lets face it, its a tried and true way to create need.  I woiuld guess the other option is just to add a 2nd special mission tab or page 2.  Personally, Im in favor of option 2, but that's because I'm a little behind the curve in farming GotG toons."
FutureFight,3bnq16,Blitqz21l,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:24:07 2015 UTC,"I recommend yes. I expect they will replace the special missions and perhaps rotate them. It has to do with the economics of a free to play game. Having characters whose availability is time-limited keeps people playing over time because we will want to take advantage of every opportunity to acquire them. Even characters that aren't as great (Yondu) will have increased value if they are time-limited.  I also don't see a great way for them to do multiple chapters in the interface, which they would have already known they were going to do before the rollout of GOTG. So that also points to Guardians getting replaced (and, again, maybe rotated back in seasonally)."
