I would sometimes give up my lunch or whatever food I have if I had the opportunity to. For example, I had bought some sweet buns and had some leftover items like a Ensure. A man/boy asked for some change so he could buy some items from the salvation army. My dad gave him some money and I offered him some food. I didn't know what his living conditions, but it made me sad what he said to me after I gave him some food. I asked him if he was hungry and if he wanted food. He said yes. He also told me that he hadn't eaten for days and God bless. :( I saw a thing where someone installed a neighborhood refrigerator for locals to put food donations and anyone who needed it could come take what they need. I thought it was an amazing idea."

randomactsofkindness,3adfbx,0Fsgivin,2,Fri Jun 19 23:57:39 2015 UTC,"Correct. Because the (listed) issue was that the flight was delayed due to air traffic control in Houston which is apparently something outside the airline's control. However it was a 45 minute air traffic control delay and a 42 min baggage loading delay (as the baggage loaders were understaffed and this IS within the airline's control). The Captain and the flight attendant on my delayed flight made sure I knew this fact so I could let ""customer service"" know. However the agents refused to do anything because apparently United's policy is to go by what caused the ""greater delay"" - no matter that if the baggage delay hadn't happened I would have made my flight.  The supervisor I spoke to at the airport was so incredibly rude to me while I literally begged her for help.   Anyways, I could complain about the situation that caused this and United for days but I really wanted to take the positive and remember what these people did for me."

randomactsofkindness,3a2h83,bubonis,3,Tue Jun 16 18:36:36 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to share, I'm really interested if you strike up a conversation and what kind of reactions and stories you're getting, and / or if you chat with homeless people other than when you're giving care bags?"
randomactsofkindness,3a2h83,Kamala_Metamorph,3,Wed Jun 17 05:55:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I kept meaning to answer this when I wasn't on mobile and kept forgetting about it until now. To answer your immediate questions...  My approach when I'm with my daughter is a little different from when I'm solo. When solo, I typically approach the person and ask if I can sit next to them. I then introduce myself and we shake hands. I'll tell the person that I noticed him (or her) out here and my daughter and I make these backpacks to give to people in need. I'll hand him the backpack and tell him that I hope the things inside are useful to him.  More often than not we'll have a chat about his situation. I'll usually approach it by saying something like, ""If you don't mind me asking, and if you don't want to talk about it that's cool too, how did you get to this situation?"" I get all different kinds of answers, but a common one I hear often is from people who have gotten swindled out of their home. Apparently it's a common scheme where a person (or couple/family) will pay the landlord but the landlord doesn't pay the mortgage, and after awhile the bank forecloses on the property and the renters are on their asses. Or the person is subletting from someone else and that other person doesn't pay the rent. Losing their homes and/or jobs due to drug or alcohol abuse is actually a pretty uncommon excuse that I've heard, though many have told me that drug use (especially heroin) is rampant in the homeless community. Usually I'll offer to buy them lunch; if there's a few homeless people around I'll buy a pizza and a 2-liter and they'll share with each other.  I've learned a lot about the homeless ""lifestyle"" through these chats. A lot of the Manhattan homeless people I've run into have gym memberships, which I first found kind of surprising but it was explained to me that the cost of the membership (which is nominal at best) gives them regular access to a hot shower, clean toilet, wifi access, television, and of course the exercise equipment which many have told me helps keep them distracted from the drug culture.  There's a few homeless people that I see on a recurring basis, and I do talk with them when I don't have a bag to give them. There's a M/F couple that I first ran into about five months ago who have told me point-blank that my care bags have saved their asses more than once. Simple personal hygiene products, particularly ""girl stuff"", are in great demand in the homeless community; I regularly include a bottle of shampoo/conditioner/body wash, deodorant, toothbrush with toothpaste, safety razor, and hand sanitizer with my backpacks and I'm told by many people that those are more useful to them than food. A couple of months ago I started creating ""girl stuff"" packs — tampons or pads, sanitary wipes, and several Pamprin tablets in a little Ziplog bag — which I will hand out separately from my care backpacks (no need to give them to men). I've virtually gotten marriage proposals over those."
randomactsofkindness,3a2h83,Kamala_Metamorph,2,Wed Jun 24 16:16:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering! I'm glad to wait for this reply. This is great. I'm so glad that you talk to people. The landlord thing is awful. I love the ""girl stuff"" packs. Hey, I mentioned grocery store gift cards to you in another thread of yours, since you probably don't carry around these backpacks all the time.   Last year, I asked about how to strike up a conversation, since my life is so different that I couldn't even imagine losing my safety net, and the sub gave me some good answers. That's one reason I asked you about your chats, because of this thread that just asked us not treat homeless people as invisibles. Also, I've pointed people to this thread about care packages too, you probably know most of it, plus you've talked to your target audience, but you still might be interested.   So then my followup question ~ Care packages are awesome but they are band-aids. A couple of years ago the guy who did Year of Giving partnered up with a homeless guy so that they could motivate each other. Anthony was chronic homeless, and has actually been housed for a full year by now. One thing that I couldn't help noticing was how much energy it took for Reed to get help for just one person.   So do your people talk about, (or do you have any thoughts,) about how they can get off the streets? Either big picture stuff or even just the individuals you talk to."

In Las Vegas there are panhandlers at pretty much every Freeway off ramp and major cross streets.  After seeing news articles of people panhandling and then driving off in new cars I have become a bit jaded towards that method of donations.  I also feel that giving them money will encourage them to continue panhandling rather than pursuing a job.  I know that isn't true of all of them, but I would rather find a situation like I did and contribute money to someone who is generally putting their money to good use.  If I was to help a panhandler I would rather give them food or something rather than cash."

But I do know a panhandler personally, and he's getting disability and/or food stamps because he's unable to work. Back when I was young and naive, I think I supported a panhandler who slept in the park near my bus stop. I finally wised up and bought him a couple McDinners."

I just hope it makes people feel a little better about life, getting those little comments on their posts. It's something small you can do and it doesn't cost anything."

I used to wander a local Goodwill or thrift shop, perhaps a grocery store and buy or give money to someone whom looked like they needed the pick me up.  I have gone to local shelters and talked to the counselors and asked which of the women/men were in job training programs, had jobs and perhaps needed a new outfit, a hair cut or a mani-pedi. Just to give them confidence.   I have often found a mother whom might look frazzled and asked them if I could buy them a coffee/tea and sit and talk with them.   Just remember an act of kindness doesn't have to be big, it can be even carrying an older person's groceries, helping someone just to know that humanity isn't gone.. and people still care and want nothing in return."

I stuck it in my car, thinking I'd look the person up (no addresses anywhere, just his name) and only a few months ago, recalled that I had it. I ended up locating the guy and found his email address and he was most appreciative. He gave me his address (from out of state) and I mailed him his belongings. Cost me maybe $2. Even though I'd said it was not necessary, in return, he sent me a $5 bill for my trouble and a brochure for his self-owned business. I checked out his website and it's really kind of awful. He's an older gentleman and from the looks of his site, I'm guessing he designed it himself and has little to no graphics/website know-how. I happen to be a graphics/website design kinda guy and I have so many things I should be doing, but a huge part of me REALLY wants to rebuild this guy's website someplace and just give him the username/password and say ""Enjoy it and good luck to you.""

However, he did mention that the next time he's in town (he lives 500 miles away, soo..) he'd be honored to take me to dinner. I did make a beautiful site I'm proud of, though.

In 2010 I was living in Branson, MO and eventual moved in with a very nice girl who was originally from Seattle. As it turns out, we were both hopeful to make our stay in Missouri temporary. We decided to move to Seattle together, visiting my dad in North Carolina for a month or two in the process. I wanted to show him I was happy and making something out of my life. Unfortunately our relationship desolved, and I was left abandoned in North Carolina with everything I had planned for the past year voided.  I am so glad to say that I was determined not to let anyone change what I had set out to do! I pulled together what money I could, borrowed a little more, and took off across country to Seattle, WA.  My life here has been a never ending thrill ride since! Coming to Seattle (and maybe doing it by myself) has really changed my whole perspective on life! If you cant have fun where I live, somethings wrong with you!  TLDR: Im so grateful that I decided not to let anything hold me back or stop me in accomplishing my dreams.

We haven't done it in a while, as I was a struggling student for a few years, but it's something I want to return to. We didn't pay off lay aways, but we would obtain information about local families who needed extra help. Normally we would contact things like food banks etc, tell them what we planned and ask for info like How many kids, gender, clothing size, preferred toys, needs and wants. We would raise money and then go on massive shopping sprees to fill the order. We always had toys and clothes for the kids, a few nice items for the parents and when possible, a box of food from a donation drive. We would wrap the stuff, label the items ""Girl age 10"" etc and then a very discreet representative would deliver the boxes to the homes.   The whole thing was so satisfying. I don't think I've ever been as proud of that as I have been about anything else I've done. It's motivating, sometimes challenging and a lot of fun. Anyone who can do their own version of helping a family for Christmas, I highly recommend it.

Ok, basically go to the layaway counter and tell them you want to pay off someone else's layaway. They'll give you the option of paying some, or the entire balance. Sometimes you can tell them your budget and they'll look for something in the price range. If you pay it off, they will notify the customer that it has been paid off and is ready for pick up. Some stores say pick up must be within 5 days after final payment. Sometimes I'll leave a balance of $1-$10 it won't be like a ticking time frame to pick it up.  Hope that makes sense!!"

Everything she has is in that car, she lives on the floor in someone's house which is very sad because she has a kid. I don't have much but I want to help her with what I can, I know a few bucks will make her day. I want to help her not because I feel bad but because I've been there, I had nothing, and lived in a closet. I know how it feels. I'm trying to find ways to make some extra cash but it's hard. I know she'll appreciate whatever I do for her, especially because we didn't know each other that much, and the smile of that little boy's face made my day. Give and you'll get back😀. This is awesome"

randomactsofkindness,2l9jsv,Purplesparklemonkey,3,Wed Nov 5 01:17:29 2014 UTC,You're really bolstering yourself more so than spreading kindness.  Saying a 25 dollar gift card is worth millions to him just because he's homeless is a bit of a stretch and kinda sounds douchey.  If homeless people couldn't find food they'd be dead so he obviously can feed himself.

If you live your life to the fullest you might get the same satisfaction as these people are getting. Homeless men and women live their lives being called names, shouted at, and sometimes abused physically. They beg for change to eat and even buy drugs or booze to feel some escape from their troubles, they sure don't consider a hair cut and shave! I have personally learned to just be kind to them, if i don't have anything to physically give them, i give them my ear and heart.

LONGGGGG story short----she just got her masters', teaches in an innerinnerinner city poverty stricken area which is an extremely intense experience.   They have NO books, no computers, usually no paper, no writing utensils.  I could go on.  She spent 1500 just in Aug to get ready for school.  She is taking two super specialized courses that will make her very coveted as far as spec ed and reading spec ed.  They however are right after school for the entire school year!  They were all day the week b4 school started so she, with her OCD, had to set up her class AFTER those classes at like 3pm and come in Sat and Sun to do it.  Other teachers got three full days to do it.  And one last thing----she was just diagnosed w/ a nerve problem in her arm which is extremely painful 24/7, so she set up the entire thing w/ this pain, including not being able to grasp/hold things.  BLAHHHH!!  I'm not trying to be negative at all, she always has a smile on her face and is positive minded....your post just prompted me to tell her story also.  I'm going to mention to her that she needs to post on r/rass cuz she still needs alot of supplies....she only wants the best for her kids.  Congrats on being a new teacher.

He was busy with work, but even so, he made the effort to spend time with me with lunch, talking, and gaming. More so, he reminded me the importance of taking care of myself and pushing forward and never giving up on my dreams. So ya. I know the feeling man. Good job and keep it up. You may not feel like it, but I can see that you are an inspiration to him that he chases after.  :]"

As I was explaining this to my friend who was sitting in the passenger seat, a guy on the pump opposite of mine overheard me, walked over and handed me 20$, and this was no small amount of money to me at the time.

My mother has been a teacher for over 25 years and always tries to help out students that she sees potential in, but knows they don't have the greatest lives at home.  She has mounds of my friends and all my old clothing at her house, and always gives it to underprivileged students.  She's middle school, so there's no prom stuff.  But she goes above and beyond to make students lives much better, and is one of my biggest inspirations.  There's always a few students she helps out each year, and she always calls them after class offering things to help (i.e. pencils, notebooks, paper, clothing, backpacks, and any school related items.)  She loves making a difference, and calls me every day she sees one of the students wearing a pair of my old shorts or a friends shirt.  I know OP is probably a great guy, and there are plenty of teachers out there like my mother who take note and will do anything to give them a better quality of life."

randomactsofkindness,21hmby,ITwitchToo,1 point,Thu Mar 27 07:34:18 2014 UTC,"Damn. I've had two experiences with stray dogs. The first one, it was dark and pouring outside, the dog walked past me on the sidewalk. I thought the owner was just behind, so I didn't do anything. But the dog got 20, 30, 40 meters ahead of me and still there was no owner around. So I started running, trying to catch up. This was on a quite busy street with a lot of cars, and with the heavy rain you couldn't really hear anything at all. I tried to go slower as I approached the dog, and I was able to get close to it, but when I tried to shepherd it out of the street and into an idle parking lot it it started running away from me. And I figured I was just scaring it, and that it would do something stupid in panic (like run into the street itself with all the cars). So I let it go, I felt like there was nothing I could do. At least the dog stayed on the sidewalk as far as I could see.  The second time was just a few weeks ago, also in fairly busy streets, but in daytime and with full sunshine. This street had a lot of people on it, which is why I didn't pay much attention to the dog. He was walking towards us and we passed him, and I expected the owner to be right around the corner. But we passed and I didn't see anybody calling him not to get too far away. After 20 meters or so , I looked back and he was still on his own. In hindsight, and after reading your story, I wish I'd turned back and tried to do something. I was with somebody else and we had our plans, and especially with the previous experience in mind I was afraid of doing anything that might cause the dog to get scared and jump into the traffic.  If it happens again, I'll not give up so easily. Any tips on how to react in such a situation?"

In an emergency situation, get someone to call 911 immediately  It's quite common to forget, and you could be doing chest compressions for 30 minutes if you didn't call right away.  Further...  Designate someone to call 911, i.e. ""You, in the red shirt, call 911!""  When you yell out to a crowd, people don't tend to take initiative. If you single someone out, they are likely to take action.  Stay safe!"

I've learned so much from forums like /r/writers, /r/lose it, /r/makeupaddiction, /r/ askhistorians, /r/forage... I could go on and on.

I did something similar recently, that took a bit of time and effort, but i'm still reaping the benefits.  Over on Facebook, I got over 50 birthday wishes on my bday this past week.  Over the next two days, I responded to each and every one with a personalized note, telling the person how much I missed them, what they meant to me, or just that I couldn't wait for our next concert outing together.  They were very specific, and heartfelt, and I am STILL getting responses from my friends saying how touched they were by my response.  It makes me feel good to make others feel good!"

I was gonna just tape them to the door and leave, but I didn't have tape!   Typically, even when approached by a person I know is going to hand me some stupid pamphlet on the end of the world, I try to have the common courtesy to at least listen and politely say no thanks.

randomactsofkindness,202wic,imnotlegolas,1 point,Tue Mar 11 03:32:48 2014 UTC,"I agree, simply because it's also very true. When I was going to school I would always go to a trainstation. I had to wait for busses and trains. I waited for about 10 mintues every time.   Every single time someone DID talk to me it was trying to sell something or a homeless person asking for money.   Now I try imaging someone walking up to me and handing me a 5 dollar/euro bill and I'd feel suspicious. I surprise myself while trying to imagine this. But it's true. I'd feel like I have to give something in return or there's gonna happen something later (camera's?).   Kinda makes me sad thinking about it."
randomactsofkindness,202wic,Bissje,4,Tue Mar 11 01:22:06 2014 UTC,"I´d propably react the same way. When I´m walking through the city I usually am on a way to a specific point. I don´t even enjoy the sights, I´m just in travel mode and wont even let something good stop me.  I think it has something to do with breaking somebodys routine or rather his path in that moment.  You stop them in their train of thought and make them stop on their way. Now they have to deal with something unexpected. Of course the first reaction is not to be open but to be defensive. The thought that something good might be waiting doesnt even cross their mind. Because the way most of those people live is like this: work hard, earn enough money, try to save it, budget your money. You need every dollar, every bit of what you spend you have to think about. So the thought of getting somebody a coffee for nothing in return is not in their line of thinking.  Then the questions begin: Why would somebody do this? Spend his money on people he doesn´t know? Too good to be true. It seems weird. And all these thoughts happened in that one second that you stopped them. Defense : ""no, thank you."" Back on the path.   Thats what I think is in most peoples heads, anyway. But dont get me wrong, I think its a very nice gesture and the 2 people that got a coffee sure had a great story to tell. So feel good for this random act of kindness. One at a time and maybe someday the collective mindset will shift! : )"
randomactsofkindness,202wic,imnotlegolas,1 point,Mon Mar 10 22:06:45 2014 UTC,"Good point. Breaking someone's routine takes them out of the comfort zone, so a 'no' is easier said simply because they get to get back to their comfort zone as soon as possible."
randomactsofkindness,202wic,Coelha1717,2,Tue Mar 11 01:23:16 2014 UTC,"I don't think that it's what you were trying to do, that people couldn't get, it's how you were trying to communicate it. We are conditioned to not accept pamphlets, or think someone wants something when they engage in conversation. I'm sure if you'd paid for the person in front of you in line, people would have been more receptive. That's what i've done, or the person right after me. That's when they're engaged, ready to place their order, and ready to listen to a friendly offer. Marketing people like to call this a touchpoint. Find appropriate touchpoints for random acts of kindness, and believe you me, you will make lots of peoples' days. Have fun! And great that you're making an effort :)"
randomactsofkindness,202wic,ademnus,1 point,Tue Mar 11 07:49:46 2014 UTC,"That's usually what I do, but this particular day, there wasn't anyone behind me, and the barista working the register refused to let me just give him $10 to cover the next set of drinks.

randomactsofkindness,202wic,RorschachBulldogs,2,Tue Mar 11 07:54:39 2014 UTC,"Starbucks is pretty expensive for a cuppa joe. yes, I know, it comes in flavors with frilly whipped cream made in expensive machines and sought after by everyone (except me) -but it aint cheap. So, I dare say anyone who goes to that Starbucks can totally afford it. It is a kindness you are offering, but in general it seems to have elicited, ""hm, thanks"" and a bit of a smile. What you have run into is a wee bit of snobbery.  My suggestion, in addition to not allowing these people's reaction to dull your most worthwhile kindness, is to inscribe those envelopes with ""free coffee"" and put your same message within, but leave them to be found in places where you know some people who cannot afford that 5 dollar mocchalatteiatoamericanosuprema will find it. (I think I just made my spell check explode)  Drop some in a student lounge or a YMCA or hand one to a homeless person. Something where your kindness will not only be appreciated but perhaps even needed (even if it just starbucks stuff. I know if I was a starving homeless guy 5 bucks even at starbucks could buy me some food).  I know the satisfaction can come from seeing the beaming smile but sometimes simply the knowledge that someone got an anonymous surprise that changed their day is enough.  And no, don't ever let these people's reactions change the wonderful heart you possess. Not everyone can see past their own blinders."

Me personally, I get groceries for some elderly homebound folks.  They never asked me to.  I offered.  Because I'm going grocery shopping anyway, right?  I collect their lists and money, go for them, and drop stuff off on the way home.  I've been doing it for more than 2 years and just recently told my friends and family about it.  Because to me, it's no big deal.  I do it because someday maybe I'll need help and I hope someone would help me."

Like beautifulsouth00 said, do things for others knowing that if no one ever knew?  That would be just fine.

randomactsofkindness,1zbym2,hardtoremember,1 point,Sun Mar 2 08:12:38 2014 UTC,"For helping the homeless this is what we do. In our cars we carry:  New socks (also called white gold)  Hygiene products including tampons, toothbrushes, toothpaste, deodorant, combs, nail clippers, sunscreen etc  Non perishable snacks and bottled water  In the winter we also carry gloves and beanies   You can get all of this stuff really cheap between Walmart and the dollar store and have plenty to go around. All you have to do is pull over or stop for a homeless person and ask if they need any of what you have and they'll tell you. Homeless people are some of the nicest people you'll meet and they appreciate it a lot when someone actually stops to talk to them.   One time I was giving out socks to homeless people on one of the bridges on the strip and when I handed this one guy a pair his face suddenly lit up and the next thing I knew he was in the air jump hugging me! One of my very favorite experiences."

Is there a post office in a closeby city that you can drop the letters in to throw them off the scent a bit? Because I mailed them from the post office, they were postmarked one of the bigger cities near me. (I live in a very small town) So it completely threw everyone for a loop.  Surprisingly I thought by fessing up that I'd be taking all the mystery and fun out of it for the people who received my notes. Instead they were more excited to actually realize who it came from because in some ways, it meant more to them vs some ""stranger""."

You guys have bare bones, get people in and out of situations, and need to save their lives while you're bouncing around in the back of a rig.  Trust me, I know how hard it is to tube somebody while laying in the middle of a street, trying to get them on a backboard, with people standing over you and you're losing them the whole time.  I do not envy EMTs and paramedics.  we have to work together, be strong for and support each other.  we're a team.  don't let anybody tell you otherwise just cuz you don't work in their facility."

He handed over $465 of his own money to zero out the accounts of the children who were potentially affected – many of whom were already on reduced lunch that cost just 40 cents a day.   Is that all it took to feed these kids for the school year? Can we start a fund to pay for more schools?
randomactsofkindness,1x7pgx,ademnus,4,Thu Feb 6 21:41:48 2014 UTC,That's exactly the first thought I had.  I can't believe they were starving these kids over $465.
randomactsofkindness,1x7pgx,s1ugg0,5,Thu Feb 6 22:36:30 2014 UTC,"Well, I could be wrong, but I think it's not the same school. I think this man went to his nearest school and made a difference, and that's awesome. But I don't know what the costs were at the school that started this all.  However, what I do know is that the original school threw the children's lunches away right in front of them. If the issue were costs, trashing food certainly didn't fix that. And to do that to children is unspeakable.  But rather than work myself into a lather over this monster, I'd far prefer to channel positive energy. Can we make like a kickstarter or something to raise money for school lunches for impoverished kids? Is there something more apropros than kickstarter? If it only costs like $500 per school, we can raise some donations I'm sure. Probably never enough to handle every school in the nation, but heck -even a handful of schools is better than none."

I start walking out all embarrassed when the guy who was behind me shouts for me to come back and said he'd pay for it. My $6 lunch or so was paid by a guy I didn't even know was behind me. I couldn't stop smiling while I worked. It's a great feeling."

Today I got pulled out of class to go get it because a girl had found it the same night. She left a note inside that said she thought one of her roommates took $3 out of it so she put $3 from her own pocket to replace what had been taken. Then she looked at my school ID and dropped it off for me. And I still have no idea who she is"
randomactsofkindness,1viawc,Sigfan,0,Thu Feb 13 04:00:37 2014 UTC,"When I was younger, I left my wallet (I was 13 and my life savings of ~$35.00 was in the wallet) in a rest stop in New Mexico.  My family was on our way to the Grand Canyon and to visit my grandfather.  I realized I left it about 30 minutes after we got back on the road, but it wasn't enough money to worry about turning around for since it just had my dependent military ID, social security card, and cash in it (/sarcasm) so I figured it was gone forever.  When we arrived home about 4 days later, my wallet was waiting for me at the post office.  A couple from Washington state found it and removed $1 from the wallet to cover the postage of mailing it back to me.  Couldn't believe my fortune.   I've been trying to stay ahead in the Pay it Forward game ever since.  :)"

randomactsofkindness,1u0zm1,KANahas,3,Mon Dec 30 17:43:05 2013 UTC,"That's pretty rad.  In 2002 I had just moved to a new city 3000 miles away from my friends and family, and about 1500 miles from anyone that I knew. On Christmas Eve, I was scheduled to work the dinner shift in the kitchen of Olive Garden. (I didn't know anyone in town, so why would I request the night off?) Closed up at 8, finished cleaning up and clocked out shortly after 9.  My rental place was at the far other end of town, about 5 miles away, and I had no car or bike, so I'd been using the bus since I moved in. Like any other night, I walked to the bus station at the nearby mall, sat down, and started reading. (I was reading Lord of the Rings.)  I kept checking the time, checking the bus schedule, and wondering what was up. After about a half hour had passed, a car pulls up and a boy, probably 8 years old gets out. He asks me if I'm OK, and I say I am. He asks if I know Jesus loves me. I pause, and look up. His dad, driving, waves at me. I say yes. He hands me an envelope and tells me, ""This is for you from Jesus, Jesus loves you."" Then he gets in the car, and I slip the envelope into my book.  Ten minutes later, a mall security car pulls up. The officer tells me that bus service stops on Christmas eve at 6. I grumble some thanks and get up, prepared for a long and boring 5 mile walk home on Christmas eve.  It wasn't until I was almost halfway home before I opened the evelope. I was expecting a letter about how Jesus loved me, or some kid's prayer they'd written during church service.  Nope. $40 cash. Which was great, because I was broke as hell. My energy restore, I damn near skipped the rest of the way, stopping at a gas station for a couple packs of cigarettes and some beer. Happy day!"

As I walked out of the pre-op area sobbing after he was wheeled to surgery, I heard my name being called out. My friend/coworker surprised me and was sitting in the waiting room so that I wouldn't have to sit there by myself. She brought all of these treats! I have to say though, having someone to talk to while the love of my life was in surgery made me more grateful than words can ever express. Our families live out of state and none of our friends know what has been going on yet (most were traveling for the holidays and we didn't want to be a downer so we will tell them after), so it really meant so much to me to not be alone. :-)"

We have had a very difficult couple of weeks as this all happened so fast (also, my husband is only 29) and completely turned our lives upside down. We had to cancel our trip to go home for the holidays, which was of course sad not only for us but for our families... but the kindness of our loved ones (family, friends, and coworkers included) has helped so tremendously... Sometimes you think you are strong enough to get through things alone and it's only when someone steps up to help that you realize how much you really need them. Our families have even mailed us gifts and filled our little tree to brighten up our holiday. Today my husbands boss sent us a big box of baked goods with a note that said that she figured we wouldn't be able to do a lot of baking this year so she thought we would enjoy the treats. People have really come through in our time of need and I am forever grateful for their kindness. All the best to you and have a merry (and healthy) Christmas!!!"

The website went mad and now we've got three events planned for my son, Callum. People rock!  ""G'day,  My name is Jared and I'm the father of a little ten-year-old boy called Callum.  Callum has had some challenges in his life you might say.  He was born with a muscle disease which hasn't yet been diagnosed but it's similar to muscular dystrophy; very weak muscles, poor respiratory system (meaning many trips to hospital with pneumonia), and a lot of other issues.  Because Callum can't engage in sporting activities- he gets around in a wheelchair- he's learnt to get interested in other pursuits, and his obsession for years now has been exotic cars, in particular Europeans.  Cal's favourite thing in the worldto do is to stand on a particular corner at Double Bay (very wealthy suburb of Sydney) and ""car hunt"", which means spotting great cars, talking about them, talking about his ""top five"" favourites, a list that's changing all the time, and just generally immersing himself in supercar trivia.  The reason I'm writing this is because when I asked Callum a while ago what would be his favourite thing for Christmas he said, ""Well, Dad, I'd love a drive in a supercar but I know that can't happen.""  I don't know how this letter will be received, whether you'll think I've got no right to ask someone whether they'd do something like that but I'm just a dad who wants to do uthe best for his young fella, a boy who's had a rocky road in his ten years.  If I had the $2000 I'd hire a car from one of the supercar hire places but I don't, so I'm asking anyone who might want to help a little guy achieve his dream of having a ride in a supercar whether you could take Callum for a ten minute drive?    The attached photo is of Callum in front of a Bentley in Point Piper, a favourite car hunting spot.  I hope you can help but if you can't Callum will still be looking out for your car and we might see you at a traffic light sometime.  He'll be the excited one.

When we placed the money on the vending machines we felt like we appeared to be vandals...odd.  We have been making it go beyond even our 25 days of Christmas Kindness by just holding doors and other small things.  It is having an affect on our sons too.

Very confident, patient and always concerned about his students.  But I never even realized he had that power.  Like a fool I even questioned how he could add credit from a different institution and he said since they weren't conferring a significant degree like engineering or nursing but a generic degree, I think they put ""social sciences"" on my diploma, it was acceptable.  I was ecstatic as you might imagine."
randomactsofkindness,1s10zj,badassgirl,3,Wed Dec 4 00:07:32 2013 UTC,"Lol, you questioned him. He saved you loads of time and money! I suspect that you are a pretty good student for him to do that. Wish all teachers could be as caring and proactive as your professor."

He was impressed with that and the fact I'd gotten into PA school.  You are right.  It would be wonderful if all teachers were like him."
randomactsofkindness,1s10zj,chalkchick0,2,Wed Dec 4 01:07:32 2013 UTC,This is heart warming but I'd like an update. Are you a P.A. now? How has your career choice worked out for you? What kind of facility do you work in? Did you have any financial aid? Have you paid it off? Please tell us more about how your life is going now. I'm quite interested and I think  people considering a similar career would be too. Thank you.
randomactsofkindness,1s10zj,chalkchick0,4,Wed Dec 4 20:01:59 2013 UTC,"I entered night school in 1994 and was accepted into PA school (Trevecca Nazarene) in 1996.  The episode I related took place in the Spring of 1996.  I did graduate with my class in 1998.  In fact we were only the second class to graduate intact in the 20 years the school had been open.  I passed my boards in December of that year but I still did not have a job.  I'd applied all over Nashville where we lived without success.  Since I had my own painting and wallpaper hanging business I had a steady and adequate source of income.  I did not have an benefits though, like retirement or medical insurance. I was extremely frustrated.  A classmate told me that a prison he'd done one of his clinicals at was hiring.  My wife suggested I apply there, live near the prison for a year and then return with experience to get a job in Nashville.  We'd lived there almost 15 years, raised our kids there and had tons of friends.  Moving temporarily to get experience made sense so in March 1999 I applied.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons does a background check before your interview and then a more thorough one if you get hired.  Because of that I didn't interview till May and was hired August 15, 1999, almost exactly one year from graduation.  I did well at the job and I enjoyed it.  Prison work is unique and you are either suited to it or you aren't.  I was.  I earned the respect of both the staff and the inmates by being firm, fair and consistent.  After several months my wife realized I was very happy there and suggested we move to Kentucky.  So that's what we did in May 2000.  When we sold our house in Nashville we used part of the proceeds to pay off my student loans.  You have to understand that I worked every off day during my two years of school and I borrowed as little as possible.  We'd refinanced the house so I could go to school but we were fortunate because the city did improvements to the urban neighborhood we lived in and property values went up quickly resulting in significant equity when we sold just 3 years after we'd refinanced.  My tuition was $21,000 a year so I only borrowed $15,000 for living expenses over the two years.  I had single classmates who borrowed $90,000 for tuition and what I thought were extravagant living conditions.  My advice is live as cheap as you can, work and spend as little as possible.  When I started as a PA my income nearly doubled from what I made as a construction worker so I could have made the payment if I'd needed to with little effort.  I worked 9 years at the prison in Kentucky.  I would probably still be there but in 2007 my wife passed away from breast cancer and because of my grief I wanted to be near my brothers and sisters in Massachusetts.  When I looked into federal government openings in Boston for PA's there was a prison job but FDA was also hiring.  So I applied to both, got offered both jobs and decided to try FDA.  That was December 2008.  It turned out to be a great choice.  I did inspections of factories for 3 years and once I'd achieved some progress in my grief I decided to move to FDA headquarters in Maryland to be near two of my three children.  I now review evidence from inspections done by others, among other things.  I've been here since January 2012 and it just keeps getting better and better.  I now make about 4 times what I did as a house painter and I have full benefits.  If this generates questions I'll be glad to answer."

Most cities have a resource center for the homeless. Call your local center and ask if they have Christmas wish lists, that have not been filled yet, for those they serve. Ask your local hospital if they need books, stuffed animals, toys, blankets, etc. for the patients in the children's or senior's wings. Bless you and good luck."

From the site:   Random Tweet of Kindness is a website which enables anyone with thirty seconds and an internet connection to make someone's day anonymously.  The idea was born from the notion that in a world full of negativity, we could all use more kind, gratifying words in our lives.  With Random Tweet of Kindness, all you have to do to make someone's day is choose a friend from Twitter, type in their username along with a few kind words, and click send!

On the way my dad showed this image on his phone to her and called her an angel (I was in the back seat so I had no idea at the time). I saw this post on Facebook today and it all clicked together in my head.  They're people we see on occasion but not really close friends. I just thought it was amazingly sweet and touching when I realized it was my mom. I am very lucky to have such a considerate family.

You see, they feel guilty and paying you that $10 is their way of feeling fine with it. You did something nice, but they paid for it. Case closed. They paid you back equally and that makes it fine.  However, if you refuse the money reward and make sure they know it was an act of kindness, it will stick more. Sure they might feel guilty, but it also sticks. They carry it around, knowing you did something so small but kind for them without getting a reward. That's how random acts of kindness works. It shows the good in people, and makes it spread, or at least create a little seed in people's heads that make them aware of kindness that is left in this world.  Getting the money makes it an equal trade. A nice trade, but a closed trade, if you understand what I am trying to say."

I posted to the local subreddit asking for some moving help and said I'd pay them $50 or whatever seemed reasonable for gas and a couple hours of their time.  When we got done moving, the guy tried to refuse my money, saying he just wanted to be kind to someone in need. But he was so goddamn helpful and I had recently started a really good job, so I pressed him to take it. When he repeated the thing about doing something nice, I told him that if he really didn't want the money, he could go buy himself a beer and leave an outrageous tip for some lucky bartender.  TL;DR: If you really feel bad about taking it, use the money to leave a huge tip somewhere, buy sandwiches for some homeless guys, or something like that.

I often didn't have lunch, and would go to class hungry. One day a week, my schedule had my advanced English course right after lunch.   The teacher would pull me into the hallway and ask me if I had eaten anything for lunch. I would say no (not like I had too, my stomach did the talking for me). He would give me a toonie (2$ coin for non Canadians in this sub) and tell me to go to the cafeteria to get a muffin and small carton of milk.  I hated drinking milk, I thought (and still think) it tastes disgusting, especially out of a carton. But because my teacher gave me the toonie specifically for the muffin and milk....damn straight I drank that milk!  After class I would try to give him the change left over, and he told me to ""pay it forward"". In memory of him, whenever I do something good for someone and they want to pay me back, I just tell them to ""pay it forward"", and I always think of my English teacher.  edit to add: still learning how to work reddit, this was supposed to be a reply to a comment further down."

It was the 24th and I had gone to the post office to check the mail, then made the two-hour drive to my in-laws' house. Got there and wallet was gone. I completely panicked: gift cards for Christmas were in there, as well as some cash. I looked in my car, but I didn't want to ruin Christmas so I toughed it out and quietly told my wife when I had a second.  We went home a few days later (26th? 27th) and was planning on cancelling all my cards later that day when I checked my mailbox--and there it was, scratched to hell. Looks like a truck ran over it, but everything was in there, not a cent missing. There are definitely still good people out there."

It's good karma to give. With a small amount like that, what if he does buy a beer? That's his karma.  A couple of months ago (I've already posted this), there was a lady at the QT counting out dimes to buy gas. I asked her if she was trying gas and she very sheepishly told me yes. Clearly, she was embarrassed. I never carry cash, but, as luck would have it, I had found a $10 in my jeans when I got dressed. I put the $10 on the counter and walked out. If she spent $5 on gas and $5 on cigarettes, good for her. I gave with no strings attached."

If they are willing to go hungry because a 6 pack is a luxury to them, I think we should respect their prerogative, IMHO.  An unfortunate series of events put me into poverty, albeit briefly, about 10 years ago. There were many nights where I chose to drink my dinner to escape the hell my life was. After things improved, I stopped drinking. It's hard to know unless you've been there. Don't get me wrong, I had an apartment, although it was a shit hole. But, I had no money for gas and very little for food. The alcohol dulled the pain. I'm so thankful that those days are behind me and I'm in a position now when they should never return.

It took another 5 or 6 phone calls but she stuck through it with me and was very patient. I told her she was wonderful and asked her to transfer me to her manager.

This is a project I started last year, and we ended up sending over 100 packages.  You can nominate someone you love to receive a free homemade gift. There doesn't have to be a specific reason why; we are just wanting to uplift people. Last year we sent packages to long lost friends, teachers, elderly, bullied kids, sick family members, preachers... anyone you feel deserves a gift to let them know they are being thought of. Our goal is to uplift and inspire people to help others, and to be kind.  You can also volunteer to send your own package. You will have until December 31st to send whatever you would like, and will be randomly matched with one of our nominees. After signing up, you will be matched and sent the your nominee's information, reason they were nominated, and by whom.   We have people send knitted scarves, embroidered gifts, picture frames, cookies, fudge, brownies, pumpkin bread, small gift cards, notes of comfort... it is entirely up to you what to send.  I hope that some of you can participate! I'd love to be able to send out over 250 packages this year! You can start submitting people or volunteering on August 1!  Thank you!  SammieB :)"

randomactsofkindness,1iy4b2,dapperslendy,-1,Wed Aug 7 05:08:24 2013 UTC,"Don't brag, that's my only piece of advice. I am not religious but I love that in the bible somewhere says something along the lines of giving to others without being known. If I ever get rich, I plan on giving money not to charity, but enough to individuals to change their lives. I would help them get started, help them stay hygienic, help them to save money, and then help them to move into an apartment. That is what I plan on doing somewhere in between finishing school and starting a family.  I am so happy you continued this cycle. I plan to pay it forward by doing what you did, except keeping myself out of the loop. When I finish baking (I work at a fast food chain/coffee house) I will tell an individual that the person in front payed it forward. I plan on choosing this person by whoever doesn't have enough money for their order (you'd be surprised how often people don't have enough money to buy what they want, and how embarrassed they are of that).  Remember: You don't always have to spend money to make a SIGNIFICANT impact on somebody's life. Just say, ""Hi,"" and ask how people are doing."
randomactsofkindness,1iirvi,shnifin,11,Wed Jul 17 23:23:56 2013 UTC,"honestly, i would take    She has always been so nice and so I started charging her for smalls instead of larges. After she noticed that, she started giving me little tips. A scratch off one day, a dollar the next. It was nice and always made me smile. It was never about the money, as one dollar isn't an amazing gift or anything, but it helps and I really appreciate the thought.   This part and put it in a thank you card, and give it to her. no money needed. just a nice card. it will make her day."
randomactsofkindness,1iirvi,Maharog,3,Thu Jul 18 05:19:14 2013 UTC,Best. Advice.
randomactsofkindness,1iirvi,unkreativ,6,Wed Jul 24 05:07:39 2013 UTC,"Since she obviously likes coffee, why don't you give her a gift card to Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts with the remaining ten dollars? I know that Starbucks also sells these cute gift packages with like a mug and a bag of coffee placed inside the mug all wrapped up nicely. You could say something like, ""I thought I would buy the last cup of coffee for you"" or something like that! :)"
randomactsofkindness,1iirvi,fildon,7,Wed Jul 17 23:48:24 2013 UTC,"All you know about her is that she remembers you. So use that. Your gift to her should be about the memory of the little interactions you had each day. Even if only buying coffee.   So to do that. When she comes in on your last day, ask if you can get a coworker (or anyone) to take a photo of the two of you standing together, perhaps at the counter, perhaps with her just having got her coffee. Then give her the photo.  It's cheap, simple... and it will mean something."
randomactsofkindness,1iirvi,XLK9,5,Thu Jul 18 01:44:16 2013 UTC,I agree. I wouldn't buy her anything with the money she gave you. She wants you to have it and she knows you need it more than her.

randomactsofkindness,1iirvi,TheBaconReaper,2,Wed Jul 24 18:20:09 2013 UTC,"This might take too long to do and I realize it might be too late for more suggestions but just in case: You could make your own scratch card with the $10/cup of coffee/real scratch card as a prize, pay for said prize in the gas station and ask someone to give it to her when she presents them with your scratch card. Maybe write a nice message on it as well. Here's a tutorial on making your own scratch card: http://www.cupcakesforclara.com/cupcakes_for_clara/2012/03/the-make-your-own-scratch-cards-tutorial.html"
randomactsofkindness,1idq0m,Freckled_Boobs,3,Tue Jul 16 01:14:17 2013 UTC,"I'm interested in this.  How do I go about ""adopting"" a school supply list?  My mother is a teacher, so I know the burden that school supplies place on teachers and parents, alike.  I want to give some child the gift of being the ""cool kid"" with all of the cool school supplies."
randomactsofkindness,1idq0m,rossk10,1 point,Tue Jul 16 02:47:24 2013 UTC,"I'm so glad you want to participate!   Many retailers in my area put the supply lists inside a display in stores before the school year starts. I just pluck one from there.   For adopting a parent's list, just ask that parent for the list. Often the schools will have teachers upload a materials list to their school website.   As I mentioned in the original post, default needs for most schools are paper products of any type (paper towels, cleaning wipes, tissues). Things like hand sanitizer, disinfectant spray, cleaning solutions, bleach, can come in handy. Default supplies for schools of all ages are pencils, pens, notebook paper, single subject folders.   Happy shopping!"
randomactsofkindness,1idq0m,bubonis,3,Tue Jul 16 02:55:16 2013 UTC,"My daughter just finished kindergarten. During orientation at the beginning of the year the teacher made a specific request that any class library books be returned in good condition as they're paid for out of her own pocket. Afterwards I cornered her and asked her for clarification; surely the school is paying for books, right? Nope. Not only did the school not pay for books, they also didn't pay for things like cleaning supplies, classroom decorations (even the educational kind), or school supplies like crayons and craft supplies.  I was blown away. Mind you, this is a ""blue ribbon"" school so you'd think there would be some good news here. Nope. So I made it a point, every month, to buy a $50 gift card for the class. Barnes & Noble was particularly good as she got an educator discount; $50 turned into about $75 with her discount and some selective purchasing from the clearance tables. Oriental Trading cards provided supplies for the holidays, and a local store provided classroom decorations.  At the end of the year the teacher showed me the updated library. She was able to add about 75 books to the library, and all of them had a little sticker in them that said ""Donated by (Bubonis' daughter)"" which was pretty cool."

randomactsofkindness,1i72n1,samx3i,15,Sat Jul 13 02:24:24 2013 UTC,"THE FULL STORY:  My wife and I were trying to go the gym, but as we were walking to our car, a Japanese woman was flagging me down. It was obvious she couldn't speak English, so a little pantomime show took place and I realized her car wouldn't start. I had her try it and it was dead. Right away, I checked the headlights. They were in the ""on"" position. I tried to explain to her that her battery was dead and we'd give her a jump.   Problem is, when I checked the trunk, we didn't have jumper cables. We exchanged phone numbers and I played a game of charades to explain that we'd go buy some, come back, and jump her car. I didn't want her to have to wait around outside; it's Texas in July and hot as hell.  We come back with the jumper cables, call her up, give her a jump, and the car starts fine. She's all filled with gratitude and tries to pay us, but I explain jumper cables is something we should've had anyway, so she didn't owe us anything.  Tonight, she knocks on our door and gives us this cake, and this card. Man, this card. She drew a little cartoon character of her adorable Japanese self being grateful.  When you have an opportunity to do a kindness, do it."
randomactsofkindness,1i72n1,TheGreenBasket,7,Sat Jul 13 02:28:58 2013 UTC,That is absolutely amazing story! It sounds like you really helped her out in a pinch.
randomactsofkindness,1i72n1,TheGreenBasket,7,Sat Jul 13 04:23:31 2013 UTC,"The only hard part really was trying to communicate. She was able to get through to me that her and her husband just moved here (San Antonio) from Japan two months ago, so she didn't know any English. She knew enough."
randomactsofkindness,1i72n1,TheGreenBasket,4,Sat Jul 13 04:32:02 2013 UTC,"My S/O and I are planning on moving to Japan next spring (hopefully). A little body language seems to go a long way, and they are taught basic English in school so she might've picked up a word or two here and there.  It sounds like you did a great job to explain things even with the limitations. I know if I were her, a little kindness if I was unable to communicate with anyone would just mean the world to me. If you are able/willing to, try to talk again or write her and her husband back. It's very lonely to be that isolated because of language. Little things mean a lot more."
randomactsofkindness,1i72n1,TheGreenBasket,2,Sat Jul 13 04:40:36 2013 UTC,I do believe we've made a friend. We have each other's phone numbers. I suppose the only road block is communication. Any suggestions?
randomactsofkindness,1i72n1,epicrat,4,Sat Jul 13 05:14:08 2013 UTC,"Well, the Japanese are very big on ""local"" gifts or foods. Even if you go visit another prefecture or city for a weekend, it is expected that you bring something native from that region back to work or your friends. So if you ever want to give anything, I'd recommend something locally-made or grown.  Communication is tricky, but entirely doable. It's actually pretty fun to figure out, as long as you don't get tied up with making sentences perfect immediately. Making dinner together was really, really fun when I had a language barrier with some visiting Japanese artists. Invite them come over for dinner to experience an ""American"" dinner and have them help out in the kitchen. Japanese cooking is very different. I'd recommend making jasmine rice no matter what you make though, haha! I'm starting to really understand why it is such a staple- it doesn't feel like a meal without it for me anymore. It was fun for me because I would point and say something in English and they would say it in Japanese, etc.  If not cooking- baseball games, festivals/parades, or sight seeing are also popular activities for summer. They'd work well as they don't rely on conversation, but can go at your own pace.  Honestly, if you are able to take them out (they may politely refuse a few times first to give you a heads up), that'd be so amazing. I hope when we move to Japan, that someone like you would be willing to hang out with us. It gets me really scared and sad to think about how difficult the first few months will be before we get ""used"" to daily life all over again."

randomactsofkindness,1bh83v,molsonbeagle,2,Tue Apr 2 04:38:08 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I was gonna say that. What kind of society we live in that we have to be completely surprised and excited just getting a get well card when you are sick? It's such a small gesture but should be normal. Caring for your fellow humans and all that."
randomactsofkindness,1bh5h3,kittykatkisses,4,Tue Apr 2 00:05:44 2013 UTC,"So the random act of kindness is that you took the package to its rightful owner?  Am I the only one that thinks that is the obvious thing to do? Even thinking it as a 'random act of kindness' because you could've kept it is kinda sad. Not to OP, but just in general, in this world. I keep seeing similar things popping up here, what seems normal to me, but others find it to be a raok."
randomactsofkindness,1bh5h3,imnotlegolas,1 point,Tue Apr 2 13:06:54 2013 UTC,"The kindness was more in taking it to the guy instead of dropping it off in the postbox next to my mail box. If I had done that, it would have gone back to Blizzard he would have had to figure out something was wrong, find out what was wrong and then request it be sent back. That would have taken a couple of weeks I think.  And I have to be honest here, if it had been my address but the wrong name I would have kept it."

randomactsofkindness,1b70st,ACatNamedUpVote,2,Thu Mar 28 22:13:01 2013 UTC,Not sure about getting help from the VA or any other government office it's usually a game of hurry up and wait also lots of red tape. unfortunatly you usually have to get some kind of public forum where attention is drawn to the issue. try contacting as many local news papers or news stations. i would also google historical preservation i know they have several african/american sites and distribute grants to help with things of this nature.

I thought about removing this topic but it comes from a good heart, and that's why I thought it'd be important to let it be. It still shows an act of kindness. It's just good to learn to recognize when to help and when not, or how to help in other ways. Such as to charities who support rape victims."

I loved what you said here -  ""You see, when the goodness of your heart eclipses other thoughts and feelings, you just want to help in anyway you can."" I feel that way often!

randomactsofkindness,190hyp,seaboat90,1 point,Tue Feb 26 18:33:11 2013 UTC,"your intentions and heart are in the best place possible but you have to remember that this is a classic ruse used by many desolate and homeless people trying to get money from you for whatever. I've heard it all. I need some gas money to get to this town to see my kids, I need it to see my friend, this or that. I used to give when I was your age but in hindsight I realized I was tricked. I don't know what happened in this particular situation but just be cautious next time."
randomactsofkindness,190hyp,Freckled_Boobs,6,Fri Feb 22 16:59:08 2013 UTC,"However, OP did what was right for OP. If the recipient had less than stellar intentions or was being misleading on purpose, that's for the recipient to take up with her higher power/conscience/whatever.   Just because there are dirtbags who take advantage doesn't mean we should dismiss others because of that. It's not our place to judge whether or not a person really needs the help; it's our job to help other humans when we have the opportunity."
randomactsofkindness,190hyp,seaboat90,3,Fri Feb 22 17:19:18 2013 UTC,"you're right, these acts of kindness are more for the giver than the recipient. What I'm saying is that as you get older, you'll be able to better allocate the resources you give to benefit others so that what you're doing can actually help a person rather than just make you feel good. I felt really good when I gave the guy money who was desperate to go see his kids. Years later, I realized he was trying to score meth. didn't change how I felt then but it did change how I feel about it now."
randomactsofkindness,190hyp,Freckled_Boobs,3,Fri Feb 22 18:41:39 2013 UTC,"I'll be 36 next month. I still do these things.   OP did exactly as I would have. Rather than giving money, bought a meal. I'm much more comfortable doing that and I suggest to others to do the same.   Not that it makes it okay, but you could've saved someone else heartache by providing meth money. Depending on how desperate the user was, he could've terrorized a family by breaking in to steal stuff in the middle of the night.   It's strange how things fall in place like that sometimes!"
randomactsofkindness,190hyp,seaboat90,3,Fri Feb 22 18:47:00 2013 UTC,"no you're totally right, that's a great way to look at it. also, I'm very much on the meal bandwagon. if someone asks me for some money for something to eat, I'll offer to buy them something and good number of these people accept it. I'm totally okay with that."
randomactsofkindness,190hyp,Freckled_Boobs,2,Fri Feb 22 19:10:30 2013 UTC,"A couple summers ago I did something similar. There was a man--who I'm pretty sure is a county jail regular for public intox--standing at the entrance to a strip mall. In this strip mall is a HUGE Kroger grocery store that has to be 5 acres or more, Sonic, Captain D's, Longhorn, Panera, Five Guys, Starbucks, and a Japanese restaurant. On the same street as this location are no fewer than a dozen more fast food & casual sit-down restaurants.   Then there were the shoppers. There were a gazillion people going in and out because it was summer and kids were out of school.   He was out there with a sign stating that he was a hungry veteran.   It made me physically ill that not one of those people who were out eating or shopping offered him even a $1 cheeseburger from Sonic. I bought him what I could afford at the time: A decked out double bacon cheeseburger with large tater tots, large drink, and an ice cream sundae.   He cried as he thanked me over and over.   When I shared the story with my friends, I got very much the same reaction from most. ""Why did you do that? He's just a lazy ol' ______! You were taken for a ride!"" and so on.   If that's what being a gullible fool feels like...well, I'm happy to be labeled as such :)"
randomactsofkindness,190hyp,peachiebaby,1 point,Fri Feb 22 19:23:46 2013 UTC,"I do realize this and agree with what you say, but I think buying food for someone generally prevents them from buying bad things with the money you spare for them."

You know what, even giving these people food isn't going to help the real problem behind their suffering, even if they are hungry. Give a guy a sandwich and he's good for a few hours. What next? he's still poor, still hungry, but hey! you feel good about yourself and you can come to a place like this and tell the whole world about it!"
randomactsofkindness,190hyp,peachiebaby,1 point,Wed Feb 27 15:46:05 2013 UTC,"yeah that's the big issue here. i just think, i am more empathetic than most people (not saying other people are bad, it's probably even a weakness of mine)... so much so that i feel compelled to help out.. even if it doesn't end their suffering or fixes the main point behind it. it just feels painful to see someone like that. i don't know how to deal with it or understand how others can walk past it, emotionless lol"

randomactsofkindness,18vsze,RaptorGoRawr,1 point,Wed Feb 20 14:07:37 2013 UTC,"People not reacting is a psychological thing. I'm not sure what the term is but this is what I remember.  The larger the group, the less likely it is that someone will help. Everyone thinks ""someone else will help"" either consciously or unconsciously. But in small groups or when alone, people are more likely to feel the need to help. Probably because of fear of being blamed later if they don't help. In the larger group, blame is distributed among the whole group.  I have heard if you need help in a situation, don't just expect someone to help. Look for someone that seems like they could help the most(like a large man in a physical situation or a  kind looking woman to help a small child) and point at them and say ""I need your help."". They will be much more likely to assist you."

I was living with relatives nearby so at least my rent and utilities were taken care of. But any special food (and I can drink regular milk) that I wanted I bought myself so I didn't eat too much of their food be ausw they are both retired and older. I also had to buy any teaching supplies I needed for lessons with my own money.   One day I'm at the grocery store on the way home from teaching and I grab a few things I absolutely had to have like milk, bread and a few things to make lunches with for school. I also decided it had been a long week and I made a small bag of that mix and match candy that some stores have.  I get through the check out and the bag of candy puts me over the amount of cash I had to spend. So disappointed I ask the cashier to please out back the candy and sorry for the problem because I only have enough for what I absolutely needed. The guy behind me told the cashier not to put the candy back and to ring it up on his order. I thanked him and he said of course. We all deserve a treat once and in a while and I wouldn't want you to have to choose between milk and candy.   This was four years ago and I remember that day perfectly."

Stick them all in one thread, maybe. I don't know.  It's like we just move from one self-centered thing to the next here. Actual kindness is a rarity."

randomactsofkindness,18bam3,imnotlegolas,3,Mon Feb 11 20:58:28 2013 UTC,"It's difficult to define what goes here and what doesn't.   I agree, that perhaps the chinese food thing felt like boasting a bit too much, and didn't 'feel' as good when you read about another random act of kindness, like for example this guy who went to Africa and took pictures, helping out the kids there. It's a kindness that he did and shared with everyone, but it was nice to see.  There are other examples such as those. The point is, we cannot exactly discriminate between someone being proud of giving a dollar to a stranger and someone saving people from a burning house-type of kindness."

randomactsofkindness,185sgc,powelly,2,Fri Feb 8 23:03:23 2013 UTC,I have seen more than one story where affluent individuals stopped by thrift clothing shops and struck up quiet conversations with certain people then handed out twenties or hundreds to people who most needed it.

I was at a discount store the other day and lady in front of me had a little boy, 2 or 3 years old. He picked up a little toy car from the end cap and showed it excitedly to his mom, She was a great mom, agreeing most wholeheartedly about what a great car it was and how she was impressed that he had noticed it. But then in a low voice she whispered to him that, ""I know you like it honey but we can only buy these groceries today."" Apparently he had heard this before, so he didn't cry or throw a tantrum, he just set the little car back down with a sad look on his little face. The little toy car was only $3. I picked it up when my turn came to check out and asked the cashier to scan it and then tapped the lady on the shoulder and asked if I could give it to her little boy. The smiles on her and her son's face were priceless!"

It's not like they just gave him a job or a place to stay for a month and let him go on his way. It sounds like they helped him for a while or committed to helping him get his career started. He must of had lot of info on them like names, addresses, phone numbers.   I'm sure there's more to the story.. I'm not judging him, I'm just wondering what happened. I agree that fame must of kept him super busy. Also, i agree you shouldn't expect anything in return... But showing gratitude, especially when you are fully able to, is just as lost in this world as kindness is. You don't have to repay, or reward people.. I just imagine I'd personally keep them in my life if i was him. Maybe he didn't have the time or resources to look for them? Or was busy? I dunno.

I'm thinking she'd go above and beyond a note.  My suggestion is to Twitter the heck out of these people with a bold message, maybe even with a link to a photo collage short story of your lives together, how poor you are, how much you still want to give an awesome gift, etc.  Edit: Be sure to include in your story how that celebrity's work helped give you and your fiance moments together that you cherish."
randomactsofkindness,16fmoz,Freckled_Boobs,1 point,Sat Jan 12 14:35:05 2013 UTC,"In general, a lot of celebrities, even the really famous ones, will send things like autographs out to you if you ask them for it. This can usually be done for not that much money (maybe about $5 per celebrity, which really isn't that much).   Here's a couple of sources detailing how to get autographs. This one explains in general how to get a celebrity to send you something. This one explains the process in greater detail, and even gives some celebrity addresses toward the end (most of them are younger actors, but I did notice the list included Lady Gaga and Katy Perry).   Basically, though, all you have to do is find out a celebrity's address, send them a letter, and you'll usually get something back. If you explain in the letter that you're doing this for your fiance as a wedding day gift, I suspect that many of them will personalize either a picture or a note for her. You'd probably have even better luck if you emphasize how much it would mean to your fiance to have that specific actor's autograph--why she has a fondness for that person in particular. Even if they're not personalized, I bet she'd love to have some autographs of her favorite celebrities, and she'd be very happy that you went through all that trouble just for her.   Anyway, I hope this helps."

My gynecologist told me that there wasn't much they could do and took me off their system. I then moved to uni where the new GP just told me to carry on what I was doing unless I wanted to see if it was IBS (tried that, tablets made everything worse, couldn't move out of bed for 2 weeks).  Tried most things these days from gluten free, dairy free, meat-free diets, through to eating nothing but salad just to see if it had an effect.

randomactsofkindness,1652tn,msm_deli,2,Tue Jan 8 15:39:03 2013 UTC,thank you for your kindness.
randomactsofkindness,1632co,Conquerd,8,Sun Jan 6 23:07:11 2013 UTC,"Thank you. I'll be taking care of the styling around here mainly because besides the little moderating there was before, it looked pretty bad as well.   Of course that is also open for suggestions. It shouldn't be the biggest deal ever, but if we can even enlighten one person with positive stories around here, it's worth it. In my opinion, anyway.   edit: And to be realistic, I think we shall see an decrease in activity. Especially now we are banning requests, especially game related. A lot of the recent people came for the game give away. The point is just that all those things are being done by bigger sub-reddits then this one, and our focus should be elsewhere."
randomactsofkindness,1632co,imnotlegolas,2,Mon Jan 7 00:19:59 2013 UTC,"I don't know if you copied and pasted the style from /r/cringe or what, but the upvote arrows say ""cringe-worthy"" when you hover over them.  Just thought you should know."

randomactsofkindness,1632co,scethao,3,Fri Jan 11 00:03:21 2013 UTC,So can you tell us a little more of what we should expect to see or rather your goals for this sub?
randomactsofkindness,1632co,scethao,5,Mon Jan 7 02:07:20 2013 UTC,"Quite frankly I am figuring this out as we go along.  For starters though, we want to steer clear of the whole gaming codes and begging aspect of what this subreddit became. We are looking to head more towards showing the good people can create if they try. Teaching offers, recognized charity, links to random kindness throughout reddit, things of this nature are what we're looking for... We would like to make a real contribution to the reddit community as a whole. The rest will come with time and experience. This is also why I asked you for your input.  Tell us what you want!"

randomactsofkindness,1632co,imnotlegolas,1 point,Mon Jan 7 05:25:34 2013 UTC,"Will do, but it should be noted the ban is not complete. You can still offer games. For example, if you are feeling generous and would like to give someone a game on steam, if you have some old games you no longer use and would like to give them to someone. What is not allowed is begging for games, posting codes, etc.    EDIT: Requesting games is not permitted in /r/RandomActsOfGaming.

randomactsofkindness,15v2mt,mandilew,1 point,Thu Jan 3 03:04:43 2013 UTC,"I second ASL Pro and recommend Signing Savvy. There are actually a TON of free and cheap sing language resources available. Youtube has some good videos and channels. For fun, there are people signing to popular songs, like CaptainValor and allyballybabe. But there are also pretty decent videos for beginners: Expert Village is one, then TWYHblog, aderi9, signlanguage101, and everydayasl.  If you can buy from Amazon, legally download, or borrow... there are some awesome books and potentially useful software that can help, too. The Complete Idiot's Guide to American Sign Language is one of my favorite books, actually. It may be helpful to get a phrase book, a vocabulary book, a grammar book, flashcards, and a beginner's guide. Oh, and my library in Colorado had TONS of these ASL resources. So definitely check your local libraries or local college libraries.   I also used Instant Immersion American Sign Language Deluxe software and though it has mixed reviews, I found it quite helpful as a tool. You might consider having either DVDs, software, or both.   If you're not American, then sorry I couldn't help."
randomactsofkindness,15v2mt,belovebepeace,1 point,Thu Jan 3 04:06:03 2013 UTC,"I know it sounds silly, but there is a kids show, called ""Signing Time"" and it's fantastic.  It teaches with cleaver songs and repetitive motions.  You could probably find it online.  The other suggestion I have is to go to your local value village (type store) and look in their flash card and book sections."
randomactsofkindness,15v2mt,i12burs,1 point,Thu Jan 3 04:20:56 2013 UTC,"I know it sounds old fashioned, but try buying a book with the alphabet and a few basic signs, and try to memorize them.  Then look around your community (especially your university) for Deaf Club, or Deaf Dinner, or Silent Hour-- these are places where the deaf community where you live will meet to chat, eat, and just hang out.  Honestly, the best way to learn sign language is to try to communicate with deaf people!  Even if you just know the alphabet, people will be extremely patient with you while you try to communicate.  Brace yourself at the beginning, though.  Deaf people can seem like assholes be very blunt, but it's just a part of the culture.  One of my first times at a Silent Hour, a girl told me that she liked my dress but I was a little too fat for it.  She meant nothing malicious by it, and I laughed about it, but that's a perfect example of how there is a whole culture around sign language and deafness.  A good book for learning ASL:  Learn to Sign the Fun Way by Penny Warner  It looks like a kids' book, but I promise it is helpful.  Best of luck!  PM me if you want any other book suggestions, too!"

randomactsofkindness,15rwaq,Doamax,4,Tue Jan 1 17:18:46 2013 UTC,"Because that is what is available on amazon. I dont actually buy food online for myself bc it is a bit less reasonably priced than just going to the store. However, if i use an amazon wishlist, the giver knows I am getting food, not something useless like soda or whatever. I also tried to include prime items because it makes shipping cheaper. Plus actually 4 boxes of special k for $12 is not too bad really, and I have gallstones so I have to be careful about the fat I intake. 20 grams of fat a day can be hard."
randomactsofkindness,15rwaq,epicrat,3,Wed Jan 2 03:08:47 2013 UTC,"Well that makes sense, and I didn't realise it was 4 boxes, a single box down under is $6 at the super market.

Since I made an account and am posting for the first time, I guess I'll throw in my hand. I would actually prefer if you could help out a friend from another site. Her Autistic roommate left her soon to be without a house if she cannot come up with at least $300 in the next few days. I'm sure he doesn't know any better, but he was supposed to pay their rent. Instead he got upset, went home to his parents, cancelled their lease (it was in his name), and spent the money they gave him for rent on having his truck towed. I'd hate for her to be homeless, even if it's just until payday, because someone who has mental problems used all her money. If you can spare some change to help her, her Paypal is kyranogaara[at]gmail.com and she only has two days to come up with the money.  I, myself, am an artist for hire. I have been trying to take on more art commissions out of charity for her and donating the profits to her. Unfortunately, I just found out Monday that I have arthritis (I'm 24), and my hands are refusing to let me draw tonight because it's raining. As much as I want to be able to hand her the money myself, my own family is suffering because of my inability to keep up with my work. I have 8 pages of art to do as it stands, and I need at least one more paid for and done by the 25th or I will have overdrawn both my debit and credit accounts.  I understand all this sounds hard to believe. If you want proof, there is plenty, but you may have to join another free site to see it or I can try to take some screenshots. =/"

I have no idea how one would come across a TENS Unit, but I'm sure I can get that at some point through insurance. A VERY hot heating pack, preferably moist heat - good ones that don't either only get warm or break down after 3-6 months - they're around $60 or so, and it works well with the TENS Unit to help reduce my pain. Another expensive thing I need is a new O2 Sensor.   But if any of those things are too expensive and/or not to your liking... I also need a spark plug and that's like $7.

Mainly groceries for my aunt because she has two children and isn't well off at all (she broke her back and can't work). I have a lot of family members and it's one of those situations where I don't want to leave anybody out and I obviously enjoyed making them happy. Unfortunately, even though I have been working a temporary christmas job I didn't plan ahead, and now I'm stuck with only £50 to last me for this month. Of course, my rent is paid and I'm not going to die of starvation or anything like that, but if someone asked me what the main thing would be to make me worry less it would be a month system one bus pass for Greater Manchester. I think they're about £70 or something like that though. I'm going to find it difficult to travel to and from work and college so I figured if you're offering anything, that is what I would request at this time.

Whenever your pile gets up to $100 go into a store and scope it out for someone who looks like they could use it and buy everything they have for them. Also if a kid asks their parents for a toy or something in a store that their parents can't afford, ask the parent if it would be okay for you to buy it for them. Just a few ideas."

randomactsofkindness,15edeu,IceBankMiceElf69,20,Tue Dec 25 00:42:58 2012 UTC,its probably becuase of the guy who gave away steam games for a couple of hundreds of dollars. And that gave the subreddit alot of attention so now other people also want games.
randomactsofkindness,15edeu,sneaky113,9,Tue Dec 25 00:44:11 2012 UTC,"Yup, and now people are going to the length of lying and making up stories to desperately get a free game when they can go to the store and buy a prepaid visa or master card.

randomactsofkindness,15edeu,hershay,2,Tue Dec 25 08:59:55 2012 UTC,seriously.  especially something as petty as CoD Black Ops.  Some guy was begging for it and then got all pissy when someone said they wouldn't give it to him because he didn't want to give anything to a brony.
randomactsofkindness,15edeu,soupdogg8,1 point,Tue Dec 25 09:09:36 2012 UTC,This subreddit has been dead for a while. No mod activity whatsoever. I created /r/Randomactofkindness after trying to make this subreddit active again. It just needs filling.
randomactsofkindness,15edeu,Xibyr,10,Tue Dec 25 12:12:34 2012 UTC,Fully supporting this thread.
randomactsofkindness,15edeu,Cheffrin,8,Tue Dec 25 02:53:27 2012 UTC,might aswell rename it /r/givemefreeshit
randomactsofkindness,15edeu,imnotlegolas,7,Tue Dec 25 04:52:40 2012 UTC,"Personally, the requests are the only way I can give. I don't just have stuff (like games, for instance) ready to give away, but I can get something that somebody needs or wants. Nobody is obligated to give anyone from request threads anything, but I would rather have the choice.  I'm a new subscriber, btw. I just found this place and I think it's pretty awesome."
randomactsofkindness,15edeu,kristekitty,2,Tue Dec 25 05:31:47 2012 UTC,"That's true, and I really don't have a problem with answering requests but it should just be under another subreddit like /r/freegamerequests or something... Also I would hate to think I gave a free game to some over privileged kid as apposed to someone who really needs a light in their gloomy lives because one's story was more moving over the other you know?"
randomactsofkindness,15edeu,imnotlegolas,4,Tue Dec 25 06:34:10 2012 UTC,There is. http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming does this.   This subreddit is overflooded with spam and not moderated. Go to the newly created /r/Randomactofkindness for a moderated subreddit.
randomactsofkindness,15edeu,kristekitty,1 point,Tue Dec 25 10:50:14 2012 UTC,"or there's this which already has almost 15,000 people there if you'd like to check it out..."
randomactsofkindness,15edeu,Xibyr,2,Tue Dec 25 13:00:14 2012 UTC,"Yes, I've mentioned this several times before. People can easily go there, not here."
randomactsofkindness,15edeu,sallurocks,1 point,Tue Dec 25 13:01:38 2012 UTC,"i see it once but whatever.  frankly, i figure it should go up a few times since folks who whine about other subreddits usually are to lazy to actually look for it! after all, they could just downvote and move along instead of crying about what they don't like but since they don't, i figure they'll want it handed to them several times..."
randomactsofkindness,15edeu,Xyreon,1 point,Tue Dec 25 13:25:48 2012 UTC,"I understand what you mean, but most of the time it is impossible to know. For me, though, it doesn't really matter. There will always be someone more deserving, or someone with a better story, but despite that, and how small the gift may be (especially in the case of games), I still feel that it is worthwhile. It is still an improvement from where they were before.  As far as I can see as well, most request posts are clearly labelled as such, so perhaps that could be an official rule? Then it would be easy for people who don't want to give that way to avoid. If the sub became mostly games request posts, then I would definitely agree.   EDIT: Hmmm, there seem to be more request posts than I originally thought."

randomactsofkindness,15edeu,sylvannia,1 point,Tue Dec 25 19:44:25 2012 UTC,Maybe we should have a subreddit for people begging (ONLY FOR GAMES) and writing stories
randomactsofkindness,15edeu,jon_delight,1 point,Fri Dec 28 21:55:40 2012 UTC,"I just joined this sub to see what it was about. At first glance I feel like I'm walking through a homeless village except it's more like a middle-class neighborhood and instead of being in rags, all the kids are decently dressed and standing in front of their parents' nice homes just asking strangers for things as they pass. A very dystopian experience so far."
randomactsofkindness,15edeu,BassNector,1 point,Tue Jan 1 05:59:32 2013 UTC,"Yeah, the begging is a bit of a turnoff on this thread. The one that really blew my mind was in /r/randomactsofchristmas this landlord wanted 1200 bucks so he didn't have to kick out his tenants, claiming ""it wouldn't be helping me, it would be helping them."" Wow, some people have no shame. ""I can't afford a present for my child"" No issues with that, I am sure it was a hell of a lot harder for a dad to post that then some teenager posting, ""I don't make friends well, give me $1000 dollars for a new computer"" That's just pathetic."
randomactsofkindness,15edeu,Cheffrin,1 point,Thu Jan 3 17:13:03 2013 UTC,I agree completely.
randomactsofkindness,15edeu,BassNector,1 point,Mon Jan 7 04:24:35 2013 UTC,"Unfortunately in this world no matter how much they have some people will always want more. I volunteered in a refuge and lots of people donated products for the children and the clients and many clients would be so greedy and take loads even though they didn't need it and those who were less forward got left out unless we monitored and allocated goods out which became the policy later. When I was young we had no technology and only enough to meet our daily needs and I am sure many were much happier and certainly more social. Giving makes you more happy than taking and those who are multi millions certainly will not use all the money in their life and cannot take it with them. Our life here is so short let's all be fair and those that have too much make a difference to others, and those who have little through no fault of their own can  benefit. Those who have enough all your daily needs are provided for, be content. The secret to life is contentment. Too many games and too much technology lessen one to one social skills and friendships. The frugal threads are a great way to pick up tips to live for less and purchase items for less. Just thought Saving used to be the way to buy things and more pleasure and value from the product then. Another tip to buy the game not when it first comes out but later when people are selling it off or the shops reduced it as more coming out."

randomactsofkindness,15edeu,indomara,3,Tue Dec 25 03:59:44 2012 UTC,"The thing is how would you know if they are superfluous??? I could make up a story right here and you would have no idea:  I'm currently staying in a hotel in Harrisburg but we live in Manahawkin. Our house was devastated by Sandy and our family is low on money this year, I'd hate to ask but my little brother never asks for anything he's such a good kid I would love to be able to get him some games! If you can find it in your heart or wallet please donate a game to him from me! His steam I.D. is: Cheffrin  Thank you and bless you!  See how easy this believable story was to create? And now me being the good little brother may get a huge influx of games even though I've never even been to Manahawkin!"

EDIT: I never said anything about games, I said there are people who need help. You know, with basic toiletries and stuff. Or they need a new blanket or something. Don't ban requests altogether.

Thank you for what you've done for all these people that im sure has rippled onto more and more people. For bringing the holiday spirit to everyone through a random act of kindness with nothing asked for in return.  After having read this I went out to the local Gamestop and Target's electronics department saw a massive line of last minute shoppers. Asked if anyone was buying any games for their children and flipped the tab. With how tight the holidays can be for people I had never seen so many tears of joy and received so many hugs at one time in my life.  When they asked why or what the catch was, I told them ""It was a random act of kindness that I thought I'd pass along"".

For those who missed out I'm deeply sorry but I hope that you find joy in some other way than a random person on the internet giving you free games. Remember to pay it forward.  Give the FM13 feeling, give the AC3 feeling, give the Borderlands 2 feeling, give the Chivalry feeling to someone else. People need that in the world and there's not enough for that."

MArc bought a sweet little elderly lady her groceries.  Marc made a huge bag of food for a local homeless boy with special needs that always comes by looking to   do any work for a few dollars to buy food for him and his sister  Marc will be traveling with me to the West Coast and any service personnel seen along the way in the   airport terminal, will receive a solid handshake, a huge thank you for serving our country, and if they   are buying coffee or a meal it will come from Marc.  $1000 check on a windshield  ?$100 worth of subway gift cards have been sent to victims of Sandy in Marc's name!  ""I'm doing to photo shoots today free of charge for two single moms that otherwise could not afford   pictures of their families....I am doing them to honor Marc, who loved his family more than words as   proven by your star in the sky""  10 meals to Marc's neice, Emily's, 100 Meals for 100 Days Fundrasier for the families in Wareham.  10 meals to Marc's neice, Emily's, 100 Meals for 100 Days Fundrasier for the families in Wareham.  Marc helped a young couple today who could only scrape together $1.00 for gas. Marc gave them $10.00 more.   He asked them to pay it forward and do something for someone else and tell them Marc did it.  Marc bought a family's groceries today. ""Are you kidding me??? Thank you!!!"" ""Thank Marc... And someday pay it forward...""  Marc just bought a $20 gift card and left it at the register for the benefit of the next few customers.  This morning Marc bought breakfast for the car behind in line at Honey Dew.  Marc received a call for help at 3am from his pretty yet irresponsible teenage neighbor & her friend. They   were stranded on the street in Onset without a ride home. Marc just brought those 2 young girls home safe.  I baked a ton of cookies last night (white chocolate chip cranberry macadamia nut cookies). The Seaport   Hotel is across from my office, and outside of the hotel, there is always a long line of taxis. I (on   Marc’s behalf) just went down with a plate of cookies and treated all the taxi drivers, along with the   hotel doorman, a couple hotel guests and a few passersby to some homemade goodness! When they asked what   this was for, I said, “it’s in honor of Marc. Enjoy your cookie, your day and pay it forward.”  On Christmas Eve, Marc will be gathering a basket of books from our family for the pre-schoolers!"

Marc made a huge bag of food for a local homeless boy with special needs that always comes by looking to   do any work for a few dollars to buy food for him and his sister  Marc bought 4 rolls of wrapping paper for a woman who had 4 children with her in stop and shop and was   counting her money to see if she had enough She thought it was a joke at first. I explained the story and   she said with tears in her eyes her children thank you and she will carry on this good deed. I never   thought this was possible. I guess everything happens for a reason  Marc has bought lunch for 3 guys that didn't have money.  Marc paid for the man behind me at Dunkin Donuts this morning.  Marc left a $25 gift card at Sinners and Saints.  Marc bought groceries for a young mother with 3 small children at Shaws today...when the grocery clerk   told her that a young man named Marc paid for them, she said I don't know Marc but he's an angel. I   noticed she was parked near to me in the lot & was crying at her trunk, I asked if she was ok and she said   she was going to bounce a check today so she could buy the stuff she needed for her kids and then an angel   had already paid for her groceries.  Marc will be dropping off toys this weekend in Bourne for needy children.  Marc donated $20 to the Wareham Police Department Association for their good work!  Marc bought someone's Christmas tree tonight!  Well, Marc just bought funeral flowers for a woman who could not afford them for her mom's funeral.  Marc is volunteering at the international market place in Hawaii, he is wrapping gifts and collecting   donations for homeless children  Marc took an at risk youth out to lunch for their birthday  Today a bag of food was donated to the homeless ...honoring the life of Marc. What a great way to bestow   blessings on others.  Decas School PTA is creating a store ( Evergreen Village) where kids can buy gifts for family for the   holidays. Just little things it sounds like. My fifth grader asked tonight if he could donate ten dollars (his savings) to the budget envelope for a   kid who otherwise might not have money to buy gifts! Thanks so much for finding a venue for our kids to see real life examples of paying it forward.  I am making donation to help women with breast cancer this month, in Marc's name.  Marc donated $10 to the red cross for the ""sandy"" victims via text message after watching Sons of Anarchy   season finale. They asked for donations at the end of the show. Thanks Marc. Happy Holidays to your whole   family  Marc gave out the last of the 10 envelopes in the early morning hours today!  Marc helped a woman out with her resume."

I have a library full of actual literature, but sometimes I need junk food for the soul...  And at those times, I reach for highly consumable Dean Koontz novels.  There's a delightfully bizarre one that I reread on occasion, in which the family motto is ""Where there's cake, there's hope...and there's always cake.""    Think about it.  Birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, baby showers, promotions, home-comings, and house-warmings all generally offer cake.  I'd don't even particularly care for cake, and yet the promise of cake always cheers me a little, because where there's cake, there's hope.  So buy a box of instant cake and some frosting, and share it with your folks and your cousins.  If cake doesn't give you hope, the delight of those around you will."

You just got bumped up to number 1 on the list, so sorry to everyone else... but yeah. I'm Jewish and I don't get to do enough Christmas things, so this is gonna be awesome. I'm really glad to hear you're doing well. Is there anyway you can look online and find a Christmas tree skirt that is similar to what you like? Or can you tell me how big your tree is?"

If that's too much, then a pillow of whatever you'd like would be just as awesome. In exchange I'd like to write a song for you if you'd like. I'm studying to be a musician and if you give me a style of music you like I can give it my best shot!

Assuming you're in the US, have her explain her situation to her state's (or maybe the state of origin?  I haven't checked..) Office of Child Support.  They should help with enforcing the payments, dealing with back payments, etc.  If push comes to shove, find a local law school.  Those places tend to have a handful of qualified individuals willing to work pro bono to establish themselves within the legal community.  What she'd be looking for is a garnishment of his wages, which is a cut-and-dry situation if they have a child support summary on file with any court system.  You mentioned she no longer qualified for food stamps.  Has she applied for WIC benefits?  Again, depending on the state, often this is an option after other benefits expire.  Wish I could throw some money her way, but I work in research and live paycheck-to-paycheck myself.  Hope the legal attempt at help helps...

randomactsofkindness,13yqwr,YogurtShaker,0,Thu Nov 29 17:33:15 2012 UTC,"I think this is very sweet, but next time you see a child throwing a fit because their parent is either choosing not to let them play anymore or genuinely cannot afford it, maybe save the tickets for next time.  At 5 a child is perfectly capable of understanding that they cannot get everything they want, and that they should not misbehave just because they are upset.  When you said the child was not very understanding, I imagine they were crying or throwing a fit of some sort.  I'm not saying that it's wrong to give a kid a buttload of tickets, but it's better to give it to a kid that is behaving and say something like ""I saw how good you were acting and since I don't need these tickets anymore, I was wondering if you wanted them?"" this way the kids know that their good behavior will be rewarded.  If you see them crying or talking back or otherwise throwing a fit, and you give them something to cheer them up, then you're instilling in them that bad behavior will be rewarded in the long run."

As a current student who tutors Oral Communications I & II (I suspect this class is the equivalent of oral communications, consider yourself lucky! We had to not only make a video, but also give an in-class demonstration to a room full of instructors!)  Some constructive criticism: Smile! This is above all else the most important thing you could improve on. You seem bored with the subject you're teaching by not having any enthusiasm. This will leave your audience bored from the beginning, and the first rule after introducing yourself and your topic, is to gain the audience's attention.  Clean your room! The mess in the background is very distracting, especially when you don't have the audience's attention.  Add background music to the sections where you are demonstrating the use of your long-board, this will add excitement to the video. I disagree with adding music in the background as you're speaking, this can make you hard to understand, or may serve as a distraction to viewers.   And lastly, HAVE FUN WITH IT! If you have fun making the video, your audience will give more attention and enjoy your video too!"

Are you answering and talking to them or ignoring the calls? If the former, this is one of the worst things you can do. Just picking up the phone and talking to them usually helps, even if all you can say is ""Listen, I know I owe X dollars, I know I'm overdue by Y time, I just don't have the funds to make a payment right now. I'm doing Z in an attempt to get the money I need, and anticipate being able to make a payment on D date.""  It's rare that they'll do anything other than make a note in your account, but being flagged as a person who is attempting to cooperate vs. someone who is avoiding contact can have a big impact later on.

randomactsofkindness,119rsj,AliceHouse,2,Thu Oct 11 08:08:12 2012 UTC,"First off... it's ok to cry.  now, i was in a massive break up once. a marriage ending one. and my partner did it because they wanted to be ""happy"" and i just couldn't do that for them. but during that time, i did a lot of research. i studied a lot about relationships. and a bit about happiness.  there are secrets to happiness. and the best you can do is research it yourself. reddit has a variety of places right here that can help. /r/getmotivated, /r/happy for example. as well as just using the search bar.  really, the best thing i've found is taking deep breathes, and having a conscience, non-judgemental appreciation for the moment. the idea of living in the now. which will be mad helluh hard for you right now. you will be hurting, you have reason to hurt. and it will take a while to recover.  but you gotta make good choices for yourself. one thing i've learned is that ultimately, we're the only ones responsible for our happiness. no one can ""make"" us happy, we can only let people encourage the happiness within us.  as far as your ex goes... well, she's made her decision. maybe she's not a great of person as you though... maybe she's being terribly misguided... either way, don't hate on her. but don't get too attached to her again. be nice to her, be a friend. just remember, you can only help her so much.  and take care of yourself. make sure you're eating right. go outside for a walk. listen to some good music. and make sure to get enough sleep, but not too much.  if nothing else... then this always cheer me up: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNrXMOSkBas"

Sing it out loud as often as possible and I'm certain you'll be at least a little bit cheered up.  Also, although the other person told you to contact her, I'd actually suggest you just don't involve her in your life any more. You can cope on your own, and considering she left you and pretty much immediately went off with this other guy (indicating she probably had intentions of doing so from the start), having her around is just going to drag her down.  Go out and do something active that takes your mind off of it - The best thing might be to go to the gym, since you'll: a) become buff, and thus more happy with yourself and b) be so tired afterwards that you'll sleep better and your mind will be clearer. Alternately, join a group, do some volunteer work, learn a language, etc. and you'll reap the same benefit (minus the buff part)  Maybe in a couple years or so, when you're even more sexy and awesome than now, she'll go ""Damn.. should've stayed with that one"". But it'll be too late. You'll have found someone who doesn't toy with your emotions like that."

randomactsofkindness,10qpu3,AFDIT,1 point,Mon Oct 1 11:24:57 2012 UTC,Have you tried kickstarter or something like it? I think this might increase your chances of this working greatly.
randomactsofkindness,10qpu3,Alekij,2,Mon Oct 1 04:55:21 2012 UTC,"The problem with Kickstarter and other crowdsourcing options is that there's very little intractability with the users. You can offer options, but you can't get feedback on a project and change it up in the middle of it. The biggest problem is that I can't do ""Vote on a design"" with Kickstarter, so I can't get early feedback.  The closest thing I could do with Kickstarter would be to have the users pay for the T-shirts and a silkscreen press, and then I could sell them a set of premade designs or one that they make up. But let's be honest here, I'm not going to invest my entire life into something that has a great chance of failing. I should go to a printer, get a quote, and make my measely $1-2 profit off of their print.  The good thing about Reddit is that it's a community-based popularity platform. I can see what's popular and why it's popular. Then I can make a couple of variations on an idea, I have an estimate on the risk I'm about to take, how many I am able to sell, what kind of bulk discount I can get from a screenprinter, and how fast I may be able to sell them. This way, I can determine if this is something worth persuing."
randomactsofkindness,10qpu3,Alekij,1 point,Mon Oct 1 06:44:50 2012 UTC,"True. Different idea:  Start a subreddit. Let people post ideas as pictures. Most upvoted post get's printed.

Outside sat a man and his dog, obviously homeless and in dire need of a decent meal.  My son who is seven noticed he was homeless and looked hungry, he asked if we could take him food. I suggested he and my husband go ask if he would like to join us for dinner.  They went out and talked to him and he tied up his pooch and came in. The waitress was shocked and asked if we wanted to just get him his own table (as he was kinda smelly and you could see her cringe). I told her no, he would be joining our table. He sat and talked with us a lot, while he ate and enjoyed the non-judgmental company. When we were done we put all our leftovers in one bag for him and his dog so that they too could enjoy another meal. He was so amazed that we just asked him. It was a truly goo learning experience for my son.   I think what you did was a great thing, and though just your leftovers, was someones meal, someones hope for another day.

randomactsofkindness,10g7rg,kamajo8991,5,Wed Sep 26 02:21:18 2012 UTC,"I cannot remember the name of the study and wasn't able to find more information on it, but one of my professors in college told us about a study in which homeless people were given prepaid credit cards and told they were credit cards. The homeless were told to buy what they really needed and bring back the card when they were finished. the cards only had about 50 bucks on them and nearly everyone of them were completely honest and bought what they really needed. some bought food, some bought shoes, some bought shirts, but they never spend more than about 30 dollars. I think there was only one person who really tried to run away and used the entire amount. I thought that was really extraordinary, considering I wouldn't think of trusting an average joe with my credit card, but a homeless person is almost completely trustworthy. If anyone has anymore information on this study, please let me know!"

randomactsofkindness,10e1g5,SockBramson,13,Mon Sep 24 12:47:58 2012 UTC,"Offer to take custody of the girl if she wants it and the mother allows it. Even if its just a school year thing. If you can afford it, while it will be a burden, in the long run this may be an option for you and your fiancee."
randomactsofkindness,10e1g5,jennyrodo,11,Mon Sep 24 14:26:36 2012 UTC,"I would talk to a local children's advocacy agency and ask for advice. There is a National (and confidential) helpline available - 1-800-422-4453 (it's a US number - http://www.childhelp.org/pages/hotline-home)  Going over there and talking to the mom (with your fiance) might be worthwhile, but you have to understand that she's an addict and she may become defensive/hostile/etc. Do you care about the relationship she has with your fiance? Offer her information about alcoholism. Recommend programs. If you're in Canada (like me) this is probably more straightforward. If you're in the US... I don't know what options there are. She makes shitty decisions, but your fiance doesn't have to support her in visiting her dirtbag husband. Being assertive is hard, but occasionally has positive results. Fiance should try it.  Consider that grandmother may be your only in-house ally in making the girls life better. Can you talk to her? The fact that she smokes weed is pretty irrelevant, so I'm not sure why you mention it unless it's resulting in extra abuse towards the kid?  Other things: Can you take this kid in if it comes to that?  Also, you could post this in /r/assistance people might have more suggestions/recommendations"
randomactsofkindness,10e1g5,MeShellG,3,Mon Sep 24 14:07:14 2012 UTC,Also: http://www.helpguide.org/mental/child_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm
randomactsofkindness,10e1g5,MeShellG,10,Mon Sep 24 14:11:30 2012 UTC,Why don't you call CPS? That family should -not- have that child.
randomactsofkindness,10e1g5,duckduckmooses,4,Mon Sep 24 12:59:49 2012 UTC,"Would you be willing to take custody, OP? You may be eligible for a small stipend to help care for her."
randomactsofkindness,10e1g5,justbeingkat,3,Mon Sep 24 21:16:38 2012 UTC,"That's what I was thinking, but didn't want to start some dramatic conversation.  Depending on how well off OP is, and how things could play out, you could possibly take custody of the child."
randomactsofkindness,10e1g5,duckduckmooses,3,Tue Sep 25 00:41:49 2012 UTC,"Small is an understatement.  My partner and I just applied to be foster parents and they pay around $250/month for each child. (we don't care about the money, just want to help kids... but it's slightly silly, and hasn't changed in our state since the early 80's)"
randomactsofkindness,10e1g5,i12burs,3,Tue Sep 25 01:35:49 2012 UTC,Worth noting though I understand the sentiment - sometimes CPS is worse than being in a seemingly shitty home situation.
randomactsofkindness,10e1g5,MeShellG,3,Mon Sep 24 13:46:18 2012 UTC,Sometimes. There's a lot to think about with it.  The child needs to find a better home placement. Those parents probably won't change in the slightest... Doesn't matter how much you yell at them.
randomactsofkindness,10e1g5,duckduckmooses,2,Mon Sep 24 13:47:41 2012 UTC,"I won't rehash what everyone else has said, but I can add this: if you do talk to the grandmother, or your fiance is able to get through to the girl's mother, I would encourage them to put the little girl in counseling immediately. Seeing what she's seen and being in that kind of an environment 24/7 is terrible for a child, and the damage is already being done. Counseling will really help her and a counselor can assess the child's emotional and mental state.  I mention this because my Mom used to work on a child study team with troubled children (likely older than the girl you're speaking about, but probably with similar backgrounds), and she worked with a child psychologist. Whenever she hears stories like this one, it's the first thing she says. Even if the child loses a parent, they should be put in occasional counseling, just to ensure they're alright and not developing depression or harboring feelings they don't know how to express.  Please let me know if there is anything we can do for this little girl. Is her birthday approaching? If it isn't, perhaps you can post in r/RAOC (RandomActsofChristmas)--and link to this post--as the holiday season approaches, and we can order her a bunch of things, mail them to you, and then you can give her a Christmas she'll never forget!  If you and/or your fiancee have the time, maybe she can visit the girl a little more frequently and help her plan a Halloween costume (to take her mind off of things), make it from scratch, and then take her trick-or-treating for 2 hours on Halloween or something. Kids love to have something they can look forward to...and candy lol. Or perhaps you can offer to babysit her on certain evenings, depending on when you get home from work? This might give the girl a chance to experience a less turbulent and more normal household, plus you can help her with her homework and establish a routine of asking her how she's doing in school and how her grades are, etc.. And who knows what she's eating for dinner (you guys probably have better meals!).............or if she's even learned things like brushing her teeth at night before going to bed.  Thanks for being so caring, btw. It's very moving that not only your fiance, but you, care so much. Often, children are forgotten when adults become embroiled in their own lives. It's nice to see that there are people who are willing act as the child's advocate when they don't have one.  Edit: grammar"

They also offer great ideas at that age. This way you get to not only spend more time with them, but you also make time for yourself in your creative endeavors."
randomactsofkindness,107rt3,4facevalue,3,Fri Sep 21 15:10:45 2012 UTC,"I would love to. Unfortunately, there are two major problems here:   My oldest child is three. My youngest is one. The games I have designed are geared towards, at a bare minimum, eight-year-old language and reasoning skills. Any game I presented to my children would be immediately crumpled, torn, and chewed upon. I barely see my kids. Even if I could somehow playtest games with them, and even if I spent every minute I have with them doing exactly that, it wouldn't be nearly enough, and they would bore of it very quickly. Playtesting a game is not remotely the same thing as ""we're going to play a game."" It requires analysis and feedback which young children cannot reasonably provide.   EDIT: A third problem. ""Make time."" I have no mechanism by which this can be accomplished."

Don't you have access to a computer lab? Talk to student services - you might be able to ""check out"" a laptop for the year. If you use student loans to pay for school, a lot of lenders will give you petty cash that you can use for supplies (which is probably the worst option but one to think about). Your town may also have libraries with computers you can work on.  You have options for sure. Make sure you look into all of them.

randomactsofkindness,wq861,negative13,2,Tue Jul 17 23:07:56 2012 UTC,Well you will most likely have a better chance when it is selected for a daily deal as it will probably be a 75% off deal. It's still $23 now but with a 75% off sale then it would be $7.49 :D  Good luck though!
randomactsofkindness,wod5d,tuttut97,16,Tue Jul 17 01:23:31 2012 UTC,"I could seriously be less stressed with some extra money.  I'm about to not have car insurance unless I can come up with $58 by Friday, and the kicker is if I don't come up with that money, it'll be automatically deducted and then my rent check will bounce and my landlord is already annoyed that I had to pay rent late.  My gas light in my car just came on, so biking to work is going to be a bummer after tomorrow.  I need some basic groceries like milk...  I have $0.19 to my name, and my entire next paycheck has to go to rent immediately.  Not being able to make last month's rent has killed me!  I'm just having a rough few weeks.  If I can make it to this time next month, I'll be golden, I just need to make it to this time next month."

randomactsofkindness,wod5d,momoffiveky,5,Tue Jul 17 01:27:41 2012 UTC,Its purely up to the community. I am a little in dept but I have the means of helping someone that really needs it.
randomactsofkindness,wod5d,jkhamilt27,16,Tue Jul 17 01:28:28 2012 UTC,"Well, I suppose there's no harm in asking, I guess.  As I have posted before, I have a baby girl. She's 2 1/2 right now, and is going to the opthamologist for the first time in the morning because she has two styes, one on each eye. They keep getting worse, so they need to be drained. The doctor is going to be doing a complete eye exam, which my insurance will not cover, so that's going to be $40 right there. I owe $100 to my electric company because it's been so damn hot here that we cannot do anything but use fans all the time.   I hate to bring this up, because it makes me feel like a failure as a mother, but my daughter grinds her teeth and I think she may have chipped a tooth. I would love to take her to the dentist, but I can't because the dentist that takes our insurance won't see her before the age of three, and the pediatric dentist won't take our insurance and I can only imagine how much money it's going to cost me. Needless to say, I feel like crap.  Other than that, we could always use the money for food and rent. I do not make nearly enough money, and they're cutting back my hours because I sell jewelry for a living and no one is buying right now.   So yeah. I don't have cancer, I just can't seem to get ahead in life."

People want to see before and afters, and since you're so early in your journey, at least put a before up.  You mention doing weigh-ins, so show us!  Blogs with only text are boring. Three posts, 2 product mentions.  Kinda weird.  Combined with the spartan layout you have, this kinda looks like one of those spam blogs.  Pictures will help, more content will help. You won't get any ""real"" followers until you've lost some weight.  Everybody tries to track their calories for 1 week, not everybody can keep it up for a month or more.   Good luck with the weight loss and with the blog!"

Source  The President doesn't have the statutory authority to create new grounds for permanent residency, so no ""DREAMers"" are being given Green Cards.  Your friend is already getting the only benefit offered (not being in removal proceedings).  If she's a student she can probably stay here on an F-1 visa and then apply for an employment based immigrant visa.  She should consult a competent immigration attorney ASAP, and not an online petition."
randomactsofkindness,w8rj1,piranhas_really,3,Mon Jul 9 00:16:46 2012 UTC,Gotcha. I understand this more now. I just posted it after I saw it to help her out. Thanks for the info!
randomactsofkindness,w8rj1,GordonGartrell,2,Mon Jul 9 02:12:12 2012 UTC,"piranhas_really gives good analysis and advice, especially the part about finding a competent attorney. One interesting wrinkle I want to point out though is her possible protection under the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA).   This is no place for a tutorial of a complicated law, but what the hell... I'll try to give you a little taste of it anyway. In pertinent part, my understanding is that it allows someone like this girl (i.e. a derivative beneficiary of a parent) to not count the time it took to process the underlying immigrant petition (Form I-130) against her. This is the first of two steps in this particular process, the one that likely ""began in 2003,"" based on the language in the change.org petition.  For example, say it took 1 year to process this I-130 way back in the early 2000's. Instead of ""aging out"" on her 21st birthday, Lauren could add this year on and not actually become ineligible until around her 22nd birthday. If a visa were to become available anytime during the year in between, it would be hers to claim!  I'm not saying at all that Lauren will be eligible, but the numbers just about add up, of course depending on how long the I-130 remained pending. The State Dept. is currently issuing visas in her parents' category that were filed on or before April 15, 2002 (not that far off!).   Moral of the story: like piranhas_really said, the family needs to see a good immigration attorney. And there are lots of really shitty ones, trust me. If they haven't, and you know the family, please pass this on and urge them to do so.  Mandatory disclaimer: the above is just friendly advice, etc... and based only on the little info given in the petition, so could be entirely off base.  Best of luck!"

It's in depth stories that capture reddits heart and this community could be so powerful if people would play the game and tug on reddits heartstrings.

randomactsofkindness,w7pzn,DatPhyzixTeacher,3,Mon Jul 9 02:12:59 2012 UTC,"I don't mind at all. And I do plan to try to create a more in depth background story tomorrow, just plain exhausted tonight.  I am a 41 year old single Dad. I have got into this situation primarily from being under or unemployed for the last year. I worked one job that as 2 days a week for almost 9 months with the continued promise of fulltime ""soon"". I did continue to look for other jobs during that time after it became apparent that it was leading nowhere. I never found anything that could give me more than I was making and that didn't conflict with the hours I did have to work both. Eventually, several months ago I found a job landscaping for a lucrative wage, but was once again only being called in for 2, sometimes 3 days a week. Eventually, I was down to only 1 day a week when someone with 20 years experience was hired. I had essentially gotten to on call status. This job was under the table so there was no collecting unemployment even.  Through the generosity of friends and family I have been able to pay my daughter's health insurance, keep a roof over our heads, and put food on the table. Paying the bills has been a matter of what do we keep from being shut off right now. I am and always have been a hard worker with a great work ethic, but times have been hard for everyone including the employers. I have applied for so many jobs over the last year I can't even begin to count.  As I mentioned in a comment above. I managed to secure myself a job just today, in my industry even. It is fulltime and seems like a perfect fit all around. That being said, it is going to earn me enough to ""get by"" and I am still going to be carrying all this personal debt. I don't believe in credit cards, because they are a way of living beyond your means, in this case, I was just trying to meet mine and my daughter's needs. I honestly wouldn't care if I had to carry debt with a credit card company. The reason people were willing to loan me the money is because they knew I was ""good for it"". And unfortunately right now. I am not.   My story is not terribly different than a lot of people right now. It took a lot for me to swallow my pride and ask for help in such a general way. And the opinions swing wildly on that. One friend considers it shameful and one thinks it's the bravest thing he's seen anyone do. I don't know. It is very embarrassing, but I know I need help."

Thinking I still had health insurance from a previous job, I got x-rays. Turns out I didn't and I got a $750 bill in the mail.  I did a thing where I asked the hospital if there was any way I could work out a plea for mercy or help and they hooked me up with a group and some paperwork that helped reduce my bill from $750 to $25 bucks after a few weeks.

Also, Dawn dish detergent and a flea comb will be your BEST FRIEND until you can get the medication.  However, do NOT wash the cat with the Dawn after you've applied the medication as if effective strips it off the cat.  Learned THAT the hard way.

My daughter is only 7 weeks old, which is considered newborn, but she's 11 pounds and doesn't fit some of it anymore. There's clothes that still fit her that are labeled ""Newborn"" and some that are 0-3 or 3-6 that fit her now. Baby sizes are really weird. And word of advice, if you get anything from WalMart, it's HUGE. I have a couple of NB onsies I got her that are still too big. She'll probably be in them around 3 months. Thankfully, I only got a couple."

Do you have a jump drive ( a usb drive that is 800mb or larger )   check out both linux options I have used both and currently run Mint.   You can follow the steps in linuxmint to install it onto a jump drive or even burn a CD. They hold your hand in each step so it is really easy to do. My mom has even done it.   Why linux? Well simple they make versions that will run on that computer it is newer and much better then xp.  Almost all the software you would want and need is free as well.

I'm 10 years out of high school, but if someone was putting something like this together for one of my favorite teachers, I would gladly chip in.    Honestly, I'm not sure it's legal to run a multi-state lottery like this...  Another thought, is would people be willing to reduce their prize?  It sounds like you've only made enough right now to cover the prizes, which is a little rough.  Perhaps your donors would be ok with splitting their prizes if there are only 150 tickets sold.  Same average value per ticket, teacher can still go on a trip, just not as nice.  Good luck!"

Apply for food stamps for yourself. You can get up to $200 a month depending on your income and living situation, and of course where you live. He can apply for unemployment. You or him may qualify for other benefits. Did you apply and get financial aid? Is there money left over? Try that. Have a yard sale. Do couponing, even with food stamps. Order free samples and such online which includes things from shampoos to food - http://www.reddit.com/r/freebies There are many different places around the country in which you can go to for food and shelter. Shop cheaply. More importantly stay productive, get a job if you haven't already, even if its just a few hours a week because I know you have school and show your dad the resources to find another job asap. Try craigslist and snagajob. Second most importantly is: DO NOT LET THIS OVERCOME AND STRESS YOU AND DO NOT LET YOUR DAD SIT AROUND DEPRESSED.  Trust me on this one. I am almost 23, not in college, and I currently don't have a job. In the past 4 years since I graduated high school I have learned to live more simply and do what I can with what seems like the little I have, but always remember compared to many people in the world, I have by far, enough. I've also learned that sitting around sulking in what stresses you only  makes things worse and it can consume you for much longer than you'd expect. Do not let this happen to you or your dad.

randomactsofkindness,uxfr3,fix_it_with_gaffer,1 point,Wed Jun 13 23:17:18 2012 UTC,"I agree with tabbee. Your dad should stay active and positive. The two of you have to make a plan, put it on paper and follow it trough. These kind of problems tend to make people feel helpless and apathetic, because it seems there is little to nothing you can do about it. Especially in the long(er) run. Being unemployed leaves a lot of free time, and with no job or other activities there is nothing to do but get depressed.  Your plan should cover the following things: 1) a COMPLETE oversight of your financial situation. All your financial obligations, all your debts (if any) and all your cash (down to the loose change underneath the couch). Make a list of all the monthly costs.  2) Think of anything that can generate income. Apply for government help like tabbee suggests. Sell some stuff on e-bay. But DO NOT include possible help in your financial oversight before you actually have  received it. I am not familiar with the American welfare system, but I imagine it could take some time (months even) to get your application approved (or even denied).  3) cut all costs that are not vital. Do it now. Do NOT take on any new loans, try to get rid of any debt if at all possible. It will save you money in the future  4)Since you do not know how long this situation will last you have to prepare for the worst. How hard will it be to find a new job? I don't know your fathers situation (education, experience) but try to estimate how long it might take for him to find a new job. three weeks, six months, a year. Do not be to optimistic. If he finds a new job in two months you loose nothing if you prepared for a year, but if it takes three month longer than you have planned for you have a serious problem. Since the first steps thought you how much money you actually have, you can now plan how to make it stretch for as long as you think you need.  5) What options are there to find a job. (any job)  Job-agencies, listings in newspapers, online advertisements. And writing open application letters to companies. He should make it a daily routine to check all the channels where he could find a job, write letters make phone calls. Every morning from 9 to 12 or something like that. Do this every day. Routine is important. Do not give up (I have written over 350 letters to find a job and did more job interviews than i care to remember.) This will not only give him something constructive to do, but it will also make him very good at applying for jobs. Which is a useful skill in his situation.  6) I would strongly advise him to make a list of other constructive things for him to do, and put them in a daily 9 to 5 schedule. Again, routine is important. This can be anything from fixing things around the house to learning new skills, working out etc. Volunteer work is also a good option. The point is keep a sense of purpose in life. It will not hurt if these activities contribute directly to his chances of finding a job, but not all of them have to. Stay physically, mentally and socially active.    7) The above steps should generate some air to breathe. Being unemployed can be a wonderful, enriching experience, once you can let go of the feelings of guilt, worthlesness etc. If you manage to get your basic needs (housing, food etc) covered somehow, please feel free to enjoy the benefits of having a lot of free time. Use this time to learn, experience and grow.  I hope this helps. And I am sorry of some of this sounds patronizing, or stating the obvious. It is the best advice other people gave to me, and based on my own experience. I have been without a job a couple of times in my life, from three weeks to almost a full year. (I still worked 12 of the fifteen years after I graduated) The full year of being unemployed was the worst, and I have spend almost 5 years cleaning up the financial mess it left me. Most of that mess was because I did not have a plan, took on loans I expected to pay back in a couple of weeks but could not, I lost my routine and had nothing to do but sink into my problems.   For the last three years I have been running my own rather successful company, which was part of my own plan to generate income. It has now become my full time job, and I am even generating jobs for others. I hope things will work out for you and your father.  Good luck!  edit: English is not my first language, still hope most of it makes sense."
