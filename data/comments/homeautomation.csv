homeautomation,3e1usc,angaaron,2,Tue Jul 21 08:49:26 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the Xbee RF Modules are for connecting to an existing or creating a new zigbee mesh network.  Are you connecting to an existing ZigBee hub?  If not, having a two node ""mesh"" doesn't make a lot of sense.  I would suggest selling those Xbee RF modules and going with either:   One ESP8266 so your Arduino with the sensor can connect to your webserver on the Internet directly over your own WiFi AP.  You could then use your second arduino and eth shield for another project. Two pairs of NRF24L01's to create a 2.4GHz wireless bridge between your sensor arduino and your Arduino with Ethernet shield.  Each arduino would need two radios to be able to Rx/Tx, so if you only want one arduino to send the photodiode state, then you really only need one on each for unidirectional communication.   I went with the first option for a weather station I built.  It's just an arduino nano with multiple sensors and the ESP8266.  The arduino sketch polls the sensors every 5 minutes and sends the serial commands to connect to thingspeak and POST a URL containing the sensor values.  The web server on the other end takes the variables from that POST and plots them on a graph.  I highly recommend ThingSpeak for something like this.  You can also just forward your purchased domain to your TS channel instead of setting up, securing, and maintaining your own webserver/DB."
homeautomation,3e1usc,drbudro,2,Tue Jul 21 18:30:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed on most of this. Doing an ESP wifi chip will definitely be easier than doing Xbee plus connecting it to a base station like a PC + creating your own host software on pc to bridge xbee to internet. Plus you need pc on all the time, or another arduino with Ethernet. Twice the work.  Those transceivers you linked... I think you only need one per node, not two, since they can send and receive. I could be wrong, just glanced at the docs. But that's not different than using two xbees at that point.   And very neat about thingsmart, no need to reinvent the wheel for hosting."

It works beautifully and there's something amazing about being able to lazily yell at Alexa to turn the lights off as I lay on the couch stuffing my face with cheetos.  Highly recommend! I already have a Z-stick and a bunch of outlets/switches setup in InControl running on a home server. I worry about having so many different groups setup, but it seems to work ok as is. I use the incontrol app for some things, and any voice activated lights I want I just purchase another Cree bulb for $15."

I didn't have to use the Wink app anymore and the delay between pressing the button to activate the light didn't seem to matter as much when using the voice controls. There are still problems with the hub, but at the price and with how smoothly it works with my echo, those problems aren't as bad anymore.   Wink does deserve some credit though in that the hub is much more reliable than when I first bought it. Light bulbs don't randomly desync from the hub. Robots are more reliable and it doesn't, at random, forget all the robots and shortcuts I program.   I think Wink owes Amazon a great deal of gratitude. The eggminder is still garbage though.

IIRC, OpenHAB doesn't work with any locks, so if you want to manage locks you will need a standalone hub.  If you just want Hue lights, you just need the hue bridge and don't necessarily need to do anything with OpenHAB.   What are your concerns when it comes to a hub? If you explain a bit what you want to do, you might get a better recommendation.  For instance, I have a Staplesconnect, and it works fine for me, but the app is pretty bad, and there's no official API.  Thing is, I don't ever have to use it because all the manual controlling I do with it is controlled by Pico remotes.

For Zwave devices, reporting their status is optional on a model by model or brand by brand basis. Something to do with ?Lutron? patents. Insteon pays for them, some Zwave do and some don't."

If latency is your complaint, cloud is not the way to go...   I also noticed that upon launching the app it would think all my lights were off when they were indeed on. I'd tap the icon to turn them 'on' (which would leave them on) and then once again to turn them 'off' and it would do what it's supposed to.

Overall HA technology is far from mature with every manufacture deciding their tech is best. And no full complete way to integrate everything without initial setup pains.  At present cloud based from anybody is hit or miss. Any network glitch causes missed events and actions My current house with Vera as the main controller took about 300 hours of setup to make the house truly automated and not just the ability to control lights with an app. With local control my Vera is way better than 99.999% reliability. A wink hub at my office that controls 4 sets of lights is about 80% reliable and the issues are always failures of the Wink cloud servers causing missed events. I would feel confident with life and safety devices on a locally managed hub but I would not at present trust any cloud based offering for anything other than novelty or non critical application."

For my audio I'm using a program called multizoneaduioplayer http://www.multizoneaudioplayer.com/ This great program runs alongside homeseer and offers a REST api. It allows you to map zones to sound cards. So I bought 3 usb pci-e cards with 4 usb ports on each. I then bought 12 12"" usb extenders and 12 of these guys http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MSS6CS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage Using the application I can tell it to map the kitchen audio to sound card 1 living room to sound card 2 etc etc. Then I bought 12 3.5mm to RCA cables, this will allow me to send the audio signal from the little usb sound card to an amplifier or receiver. Then you just hook the speakers into the amp or receiver and audio works jus fine. Using their API you can do all sorts of things like find playlists, skip songs, pause, play, play spotify etc etc. I'm building all of this into my own custom mobile app so when you want to play audio it will popup with a selection of what to play followed by what rooms you want it to play in.

The big differences between us and HomeSeer (and by the way, though we are competitors, we also work together in some ways, for instance we support the HomeSeer Z-Wave interfaces):  1) We're fully integrated, no need to install plugins or rely on third party developers to maintain critical drivers and features. Many plugins on HomeSeer carry additional costs, that doesn't exist in the CastleOS ecosystem.  2) They have a broader base of devices supported (especially legacy devices), but at the trade off of configuration complexity. In short, depending on the devices you want to integrate, HomeSeer may be the only option. But if CastleOS supports the devices you want to use (which is likely if starting anew), you'll find setting them up far simpler with CastleOS.  3) Whole home voice control is a CastleOS-exclusive feature  4) Support... the CEO of CastleOS is on Reddit replying to you :)  Those are the big differences we like to highlight. HomeSeer is a solid product and has a long history, in fact long before starting CastleOS, I was a HomeSeer customer.

homeautomation,3drwxm,fyrilin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:53:33 2015 UTC,The biggest problem is that you specified USB or WIFI connection to your computer.   Why? it should make things easier with triggering a command from my pc instead of a physical button.
homeautomation,3drwxm,speshnz,2,Sun Jul 19 12:00:16 2015 UTC,"It is actually easier (to implement) to use buttons because with a computer you have to deal with the interface between the two.  However that's not too painful and I can give you some python code that works for me.  Also, I just realized that the trinket has onboard usb so I was wrong about that - sorry.  The attiny does not, though, so you would have to use a separate interpreter (maybe the avr programmer?  I don't know, I've never used the attiny)."
homeautomation,3drwxm,speshnz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:28:24 2015 UTC,you need to interface the micro with the PC or to something that can do wifi (like say an ESP-01 board or something)   with a button all you need is one pin and some basic read pin state command. With anything else you need to handle communication between the MC and the PC or wifi device/
homeautomation,3drwxm,speshnz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:30:44 2015 UTC,Well it has to be from the PC because the whole point of this is to turn my AC on when I'm near home using my phone.   It shouldn't be a problem to simulate a key with a shortcut on my desktop right? I can take control of my PC remotely with apps like Remote Desktop from google.
homeautomation,3drwxm,PurplebeanZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:17:53 2015 UTC,"You dont need to do that from your PC. infact doing it from your PC would be an order of magnitude more difficult.  You could do what you want, without a PC for about $10 using blynk and an ESP8266.  Or just an ESP8266/nodemcu with node.js  Its possible that you could pull something together using IFTTT with its geolocation and the IFTTT maker channel to do an http put request to the ESP8266 when you got within X of your home. (i.e. automatically change your AC when you got near your house)"
homeautomation,3drwxm,Ginseng,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:39:54 2015 UTC,"I'm by no means still comfortable with simple controllers like the teensy or attiny85 and the ESP8266 looks even more complicated. I know only C so I don't know how to use node.js.  I see in the instructable that they use 3V, which is not common with the smaller controllers I know of and BASIC which I don't know.  Are you sure that it's less complicated?  Blynk looks cool though."
homeautomation,3drwxm,speshnz,2,Tue Jul 21 21:04:24 2015 UTC,"Thats the thing.  If you're going to make something, then the easiest way would be with a micro to handle the pulse encoding for the IR transmitter.   the problem is how to remotely get the information to the micro to tell it to turn on the AC (or adjust it)  If you have the micro connected to your PC via USB with a serial connection then you need to have some mechanism to send serial ""commands"" to the micro to get it to do what you want. So you have a multistep process phone talks to PC over wifi/internet, PC talks to micro over serial on USB, Micro talks to AC over IR.  You need a way to gateway commands across the PC, effectively you're using the PC for nothing other than an expensive wifi to USB serial adapter. Which if you want it to work would require you to write something to handle it. (unless you remote desktop and send commands over a serial console to do it.)  The ESP8266 you can talk to it directly via wifi, it works as long as its powered. doesnt need a PC to be on to work.  Something like this should allow you to use C and the arduino IDE to do what you need  https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino  I've not used it yet, so i'm not sure of the limitations.  Otherwise there is a pile of information about creating webservers on the ESP8266 natively using a number of languages (most likely including C) LUA is really common with the ESP8266 and really easy to use.   What i mean by less complicated is you could add the IR transmitter to the ESP8266, code the device add a power supply and you're done. Log into it the ESP8266 via a basic web interface to adjust the AC and you need nothing other than the ESP, the IR and a power supply."

However, I cannot speak to whether or not it improves anything, as I've only had my Edge since November and it's been UI7 only.  Vera, to their credit, has been releasing monthly firmware updates for the thing and things have gotten better for UI7 - I no longer have devices cropping up when they shouldn't, for instance. That's about the extent of the improvements on my end, though. The Vera iOS app is junk and has been since January (not sure if that works with UI5) - homewave & VeraMate make life tolerable with the thing.  If you feel like completely rebuilding your setup, go ahead with the upgrade, I guess? If you had other more important things to spend that time on, go do that first, and wait for Vera to make things a little better before you do."

homeautomation,3dnapg,questr,2,Fri Jul 17 17:38:38 2015 UTC,"All good questions, let me help where I can...   Can I use the Lutron Pico remotes as just a basic on / off button for lighting?   The Lutron Pico remote pairs directly to a Lutron Caseta device, whether that be a switch or a module or other Lutron Clear Connect product.  It is similar to Insteon P2P/Z-Wave Associations in that the routing control is outside of the hub, it is kept in the device' chip's memory, so when you press the ON button on a pico remote, the Caseta switch turns on the load immediately.  You can do this with anything except if you use a pico remote to send a command through the hub to a z-wave or philips Hue device, there may be a slight lag in the execution as you are going through the hub as in a scene you created.  There are many accessories for Lutron Caseta/Pico such as the Wall Mount Kit, the Pedestal, the Car Visor, etc. You can mount the Pico remote right on the wall using the wall mounting kit, and mimic the exact look of a hardwired wall switch but the remote comes out and works like the battery operated remote it is.   Secondary after reading thru the various hub devices right now it seems like staples connect is a good choice due to the various devices and standards it supports   We do not have any direct experience with the Connect hub, but according to the specs it does support Z-Wave, Lutron Clear Connect, Bluetooth and Zigbee which includes Philips Hue.  Thats not bad although one of our Contractors does not like it and shelved it in favor of a VeraEdge, and I do not hear too many good opinions of it.  Also, I don't think it supports Nest or Belkin WeMo, IFFFT or Insteon yet but it is supposed to in the future.  All that being said, its affordable and if it doesn't work, then throw it away and buy something better.  You get what you pay for with these cheap $50-$80 devices if you ask me.    Just my opinion, but again, try it out and see if you like it!  Hope that helps."
homeautomation,3dnapg,haworld,2,Fri Jul 17 19:34:11 2015 UTC,I thought there were restrictions as far as what a pico can control on wink and staples connect.  Can it control hue bulbs on those platforms?
homeautomation,3dnapg,rad_example,2,Fri Jul 17 19:50:28 2015 UTC,"That may be true, I was assuming that the Connect would be able to use the Pico as a trigger for events on other protocols that it supports.  But, the comment from /u/ShawnParr below seems to indicate you can, at least for Ge Link bulbs and the Nest."
homeautomation,3dnapg,haworld,2,Fri Jul 17 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"The Staples Connect hub allows you to use the Buttons on the Pico as a trigger for any activity or mode. One caveats here is that to non-Lutron devices the dim up and down buttons appear as one button. So if you are controlling a non-Lutron device a 5 button Pico only has 4 usable buttons. And Lutron devices always see those as dim controls regardless of other settings in the activity mode. As such you shouldn't use the dim buttons as an off/on for an activity that has Lutron devices.   As a sample in my office space I have 5 GE Link lights, 4 in a ceiling fan, and one in a alcove space. I have a Pico mounted on the entrance way. The on button sets all at 50%, off turns them off, the favorite button sets them all at 10%, and the dim buttons set them all at 100%. Obviously I prefer the light levels in the room at 50%, unless it is late when I want them dimmed. But I left the option via those dim buttons for 100% as my wife likes her lights retina burning. That room has no other Lutron devices installed than the Pico stuck to the wall.   I use the wall plates for the Picos in our Den where they look like the regular Lutron switches with an extra button.   I'm not sure why Staples/Zonoff can do this, and Wink can't/won't, but it makes the system way more versatile. And much cheaper (no need for lamp modules as triggers for robots). The Staples Hub also does its communication locally rather than everything going cloud and back, so the system is very responsive."
homeautomation,3dnapg,ShawnParr,2,Fri Jul 17 21:27:19 2015 UTC,"I have a mixture of Lutron and Zigbee. I started with Wink, but switched to Staples. If you want to control a non-Lutron device with a pico then the Staples hub is the only way I've found to do it.   With Wink you can only directly use a Pico remote to control a Lutron switch or lamp module. You can then create a robot to watch that other device and turn other things on/off. At least as of February that's how it worked. It was also painfully slow. Tap a button on the pico and it would take 3 - 20 seconds to turn on GE Link lights.   The same setup with Staples Connect allows me to map the Pico buttons to any activity (or change modes). I have two rooms that only have GE Link lights and Pico remotes. And when I hit the button on the Pico the lights come on within a second. You usually can't tell the difference between that setup and just hitting the button on a wired Lutron wall switch. It really makes the system ""real"" where when I used the Wink it felt like a toy.   I don't have any z-wave, but the Staples Supports them. I'll probably start adding some micro switches next month. It also integrates with my Nest, although it can't use the home/away to trigger events at this time, although you can use activities/modes on the connect to set those on the Nest.   I've recently installed Picos in our cars so that when we leave the house the off button sets the Nest away, and turns off all the lights. The on button then sets the Nest to home, and turn on the entrance lights to the house.   I don't see many people discussing Staples Connect here, so let me know if you have any questions as I'm now using it to drive everything in my fledgling system.   (Posted from mobile so please forgive typos/autocorrects I missed.)"

homeautomation,3dmd77,123Adz321,5,Fri Jul 17 13:10:06 2015 UTC,"I am an early bird backer of the CastleHub on Kickstarter. I can’t wait to get my hands on it, and start using it to automate my home.  I’ve played around with the trial version of CastleOS while I’m waiting for the Hub to ship. Here’s a few points from my initial experience with CastleOS thus far.   The user interface isn’t great. I’m a web developer, and I know I have very little design skills. Its easy to tell CastleOS has been designed by some software engineers, and not designers. Which can make it hard to work with. The user experience feels “clunky”. I had some frustrating moments constantly getting logged out when trying to enable Zwave, and add a Zwave device. I also found out the hard way that you can’t change the temperature units on the admin account from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Doing that will log you out too. That can only be done for user accounts. Scheduling also breaks if your computers date format is in dd/mm/yy format. Lack of documentation. There’s no wiki, or anything like that. There’s a forum, with some posts from Chris about how things work. But simple things like a complete list of voice commands don’t exist. The only one available is a condensed list on the forums. Supported devices are a bit misleading. I purchased a Kinect v2 for my CastleHub, as it was listed (and still is) on the CastleOS website as a supported device. However as of today the Kinect v2 does not work with CastleOS. I was also going to get a CM15A X10 controller, but after reading u/haworld post, looks like that won’t work. I can’t see that info clearly documented on the CastleOS site. So for me, X10 is not supported. Supported protocols are misleading. When I backed the CastleHub, I assumed the hub would ship with support for Zwave (as it was listed), and that was it. It wasn’t until I asked a comment did I find out that I would need to purchase a separate USB stick to enable Zwave functionality. This was only fixed on the website a couple of days ago.  Communication from Chris can be hit-and-miss. Chris is good at offering free support to everyone, but there’s so much on that sometimes things get missed. Since the CastleHub Kickstarter campaign ended, there’s been zero updates issued to backers on Kickstarter. Only a comment a couple of weeks ago after someone else complained about the lack-of-communication.    Before the Kickstarter campaign ended, I read a post on the CastleOS forums that read “there’s a lot of dangled carrots here”. Which I think is true. u/chriscicc can be pretty vague in his answers and timelines. “Support for x is coming soon”, “a new secret feature”, “something else that’s unannounced”. You can see from the CastleOS forums that sometimes months go by with promised features and deadlines that don’t eventuate.  At the moment, there’s a lot of things riding on the release of their new API. Which if it’s all that its cracked up to be, will open CastleOS up more to developers, and address some of the UI/UX issues above. However, until the API and Hub are released, its anyones guess.   For me, I can’t wait to get my hands on the Hub and the new API. With the promised ability to write our own drivers and scripts, CastleOS could really be a one-of-a-kind system. If I buy a new smart thing next year, and it has an API, I can hopefully make it work with CastleOS. Using the Kinect for voice controls means I don’t have to send my voice to the cloud for processing either."
homeautomation,3dmd77,phil1019,2,Sat Jul 18 11:54:58 2015 UTC,"Hey Phil! Let me reply to a few of your items...   The user interface isn’t great   We're very, very proud of our UI, but we'd also be the first to admit we're not done with it yet. To date, we've focused on functionality over form. Virtually all of our competitors have done the opposite, put form over functionality. The end result speaks for itself...   Another thing to note, especially when comparing it to starter hubs like Wink, Vera, and SmartThings, is CastleOS is built to scale to any size home, where those instead are designed around the ""light"" automation user. What I mean by that, is have you ever tried to load a full device or room list for a large home on one of those apps? It's not pretty...  So we tried to strike a balance between the two, and I think we were very successful in doing so. But there is still a lot of work to be done!   The user experience feels “clunky”   Sorry but I have to say this :) The setup guide specifically states to only use the admin account to create a user account :) Is the Z-Wave issue you were having resolved though? Also we have a fix in the works for the international date bug in the scheduling...that is just a bug, international dates are fully supported throughout the rest of the system.    Supported devices are a bit misleading   You raised this in the forum and we addressed it...there is now a prominent note stating which radios are included and that some protocols will require an external radio or adapter. We are also going to add the Wiki matrix you suggested.   Communication from Chris can be hit-and-miss   We did post to Kickstarter that all updates will come through the website. I hope you understand that you guys are just a fraction of our total user base, so we're consolidating all updates for all users to the same singular place: our website. As far as I can tell, the vast majority of KS backers (including you) have created accounts on CastleOS.com.   “Support for x is coming soon”, “a new secret feature”, “something else that’s unannounced”'   We've put out regular releases over the last few months, including last week. The new scripting feature will be out tonight! But the rest of the stuff about secret features, well, they're secret! At least until we announce them, which will be soon :)  Thanks again for backing us, and we look forward to you getting your CastleHUB!"
homeautomation,3dmd77,chriscicc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:11:59 2015 UTC,"Hey Chris :)   The setup guide specifically states to only use the admin account to create a user account :)   I guess this is one of those things. To me a user account is someone that doesn't have as many privileges as an admin, so can't add devices, change system settings etc. I assumed a user account was for someone just to turn on/off devices. I'm also going to admit, I'm a male and never read any form of instruction manual or guide ;)   Is the Z-Wave issue you were having resolved though?    Yeah I eventually managed to get it working. But I've only got the one device at the moment, so once I move into my new place I'll start expanding on it with sensors and light bulbs.    We are also going to add the Wiki matrix you suggested.   And this is why I think CastleOS has a lot of potential. As you said you've put functionality over form, and now you're starting to open up CastleOS to users more. With things like a Wiki, and taking others suggestions on board, you're really setting yourself apart from the others.   I hope you understand that you guys are just a fraction of our total user base, so we're consolidating all updates for all users to the same singular place: our website.   Hmm I understand where you're coming from. But I'm sure there are others like me that backed the CastleHub without knowing what CastleOS was. I check the forums daily, but there are others that don't have the time to. Also, the forums don't push information out to all the backers, they have to come to you. I only stumbled on the photos you posted of the Hub the other day because I read every unread post. Once again, because I have to ""hunt"" for the information, rather than it come directly to me. I would say less than 25% of people who have a Hub on preorder have seen those photos.    We've put out regular releases over the last few months, including last week.'   Yep! And each regular update is fantastic. Its good to see a product thats maintained and evolving.    At least until we announce them, which will be soon :)   Maybe I'm not good with surprises, and I need to know NOW ;)"
homeautomation,3dmd77,phil1019,4,Sun Jul 19 00:23:11 2015 UTC,"We have been testing CastleOS quite a bit lately.  Very good so far, we are using X-10, Insteon and Z-Wave devices to date and are pretty impressed.  Just installed their Android app from the Play Store yesterday and are checking it out right now, really a very nice app and easy to use.  Testing is on going but first impressions so far are that it very well could make a HUGE impact on this market as I have not yet seen a software app or OS that has as much potential as Castle.  As an early adopter of Homeseer back in 1999, I can see CastleOS being a major competitor to HS, they still have a ways to go but from what we are seeing so far, they have a good chance to be as good as HS.  Their use of scenes are probably the best and easiest to use and create that I have ever scene! (lol pun intended!).  The Intelligence Settings are amazing, Chris and the team has made something with huge potential there.    I really think we may see this as one of the main software controllers for the HA market as the capabilities of using this program as a bridge for multiple protocols is amazing...I am looking at their supported protocol list right now, reads Ecobee, Hue, Insteon (which includes X-10 if you use the old 2242-222 hub but I would recommend the 2413U instead (both are compatible for use with X-10), nothing but issues with the old hub to date - more to do with Insteon than CastleOS though as it never worked that great to begin with), LightwaveRF, Nest, TCP, UPB and Z-wave.  I know Chris has Lutron Caseta/Clear Connect coming soon, as well as Zigbee.  I would like to see direct X-10 support via the CM15A someday, in lieu of going through an Insteon modem, as there are so many users of the CM15A still to this day (I spoke to a fellow using a CP290 this week, and another still using a CM11A as a side note) and now that Insteon has removed X-10 backwards compatibility from their devices, that may become an issue for alot of older users.  We have been having alot of problems testing Aeon Labs' new Gen5 devices to both a VeraLite and VeraEdge on UI5 and UI7 respectively.  Working with Aeon Labs directly IS solving most of the issues but this week we decided to see if CastleOS had any similar issues.  Absolutely no problems whatsoever, so kudos on that as well, guess its just Vera that has issues understanding the difference between Gen5 security encapsulation and the old series 300.  Castle has a hub in kickstarter right now so you may want to consider checking that out as well.  Overall, I want to clarify that we ARE still testing...these are just our first impressions but to date am very pleased with what we are seeing.  If anyone is interested, post back and let us know, we would be happy to keep you up to date on our progress and ongoing thoughts.  We will probably post our results on the blog as well."

Now, that has a lot to do with how the Kinect processes the audio, and is contingent on how much local CPU you have available for it.    By the time you configure a PC with enough power to really handle it, you're several times over more expensive than an Echo.  And then you're saddled with the adventure of maintaining a PC.  Whereas the Echo is set-and-forget simple.    The Echo, apparently, WILL function in other countries, but not all services will be accessible due to each country's licensing requirements.  Mainly the music stuff, but no doubt other services will have to deal with regional issues as well."

Unless you're throwing something before the Core2 era at it, it will be just fine.   Secondly, the performance of the microphone is 100% dependent on the implementation of the software. The vast majority of software out there that ""supports"" the Kinect, does so without taking advantage of the noise cancellation and beamforming capabilities, among others.   Apples and oranges and all that... :)"

Right now I use NFC tags that guests at my house can tap to gain access to the music, lights, etc. Beacons would great for letting a person know that there are things available to them in a room. We have whole house audio even in the bathroom and the first time people see it they scoff like it's ridiculous, but when they go to the bathroom the music always kicks in.

The regular Hue bulbs do a really shitty job of green for reasons unknown to me.  My only issue with the Bloom is that when my lights transition to a sunset mode at night, the Bloom has a roundabout way of changing from white to orange.  It actually looks green for a minute or two while it is shifting.  I don't know how you go from white to orange via the color green but whatever.  Other than that my Bloom has worked fine.

There are a host of factors that make it difficult to tell how close a phone is to an iBeacon including clothing, body position and walls and furnishings.  Bob Kressin gave a talk a few years ago where he suggested putting several iBeacons in each room as the most effective way. I'd suggest looking into triangulation algorithms, or, more realistically, using a motion sensor."
homeautomation,3dhpci,phughes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:21:35 2015 UTC,"Hmm ok. I'll have a look into his talk.   I don't think motion sensors would be the answer. Motion and presence are not the same.

Both are easily expandable, and both support the use of Android phones, as long as you install their hubs or controllers.  Both are very capable of handling more than just a few lights or switches, thermostats, locks, and garage door openers.    Both have garage door opener controllers and for the most part will work with almost any garage door opener.  I don't think the Chamberlain is very supported in the industry, other than in their own app, or by Wink.  Personally I wouldn't touch Wink, Quirky is trying to sell them off right now.  A couple more notes for you...   Make sure you have neutral wiring run to your switches, very important and will make your HA life a whole lot easier if you have them.  Most HA switches will NOT work without a neutral. Consider a multi-platform bridge/hub.  The entire HA industry is in a huge flux right now and I would not own a hub without it having the ability to control more than one protocol.  Some examples are CastleOS (zwave, x10, insteon, upb, Philips hue, ecobee, nest, voice control and more...zigbee coming also and lutron caseta), Homeseer (zwave, insteon, x10, upb, voice control and more), ISY 994iZW IR PRO controls zwave and insteon as well as infrared, or for a good video surveillance system, the IpDataTel gateway 3.0 which does Z-Wave and zigbee coming soon.  Also don't forget Smarthings (zwave, Zigbee), Staples (zwave zigbee and lutron clear connect). Then you have the new Zipato Zipabox which controls zwave, zigbee infrared, 433MHz, and more.

Lutron PD-6WCL is a good choice but only works with other Lutron Clear Connect devices or the Lutron Bridge (either native or the Homekit compatible version), the Wink Hub or Staples Connect. Works with all dimmable loads. Z-Wave Leviton VRI06 one of the best z-wave brands on the market but not cheap. Works with incandescent loads only.  Does not work with dimmable CFL's, some dimmable LED's may work if you consider minimum load requirements and/or use of a dummy load. Z-Wave GE 45612, a low end product but this particular model has been discontinued.  Works with incandescent loads only.  Does not work very well with dimmable CFL's, some dimmable LED's may work if you consider minimum load requirements and/or use of a dummy load.  We do have 2 brand new units remaining in stock. Insteon Model 2474DWH is a 2-wire dimmer.   The only exception to the ""no neutral"" rule for switches are the Lutron PD-5WS-DV, but it requires a fixture module installed at the fixture itself in order to work, in addition to the local switch in the wall, but it still may be an option for you.  A similar option may be to use z-wave or insteon inline micro modules, if you absolutely cannot run a neutral to the switch box, or don't want to.  Hope that helps!"

Liked it well enough, though it may be a little tricker to find outside of a contractor type setting.  Switched to a Trane XL624 installed with the new system because I needed the ability to control a humidifier.  This one has also worked very well.  I wanted to play with a dehumidification mode, so I got a CT-80 with the Z-Wave USNAP module -- this one was a disaster.  It was 7-8 degrees off out of the box, even after adjusting the offset it still just didn't feel right; my wife and I constantly fiddled with the temperature where with the previous ones we'd just set it and let it do it's thing.  It also didn't report back humidity over z-wave and would randomly just stop reporting back at all (though you could still change setpoints) until I'd hit the reboot button.  I didn't care for how the wires are at the top either -- there just wasn't enough room to work with them easily when you have a lot of wires.  Switched back to the XL624 and that's what I'm staying with for now, until something more compelling comes along."

Based on a few quick Google searches, I'd suggest searching for DMX led strips so you can use the DMX OpenHAB Binding to control them.  Once you have the lights configured in OpenHAB, you can begin to investigate controlling them from the Echo.

I'll add in motion sensors once they're setup and going, maybe tweaking the timer to a lower value.  Primarily I want to use it in our 2nd house that will be unoccupied for days to weeks at a time, so it'll turn down the heating to a low level, turn the gas water heater to pilot mode, maybe run a little fake someone's home lights. Then, on our way up I can trigger it to be ""occupied"" and the house will be nice and warm when we get there.

If its a on/off switch or push button its is a simple as putting your wifi enabled relay into the enable circuit.   What type (Inverter, CHW, VAV, ect) and Brand is it? Practically all big name brands have option cards available for start/stop, run status, fault status, ect. which you should be able to plug in no worries. Thats if it's a standalone or VRF split.    If its just a plain old FCU (Fan in a box) on a chilled/heating water system you wont have much luck without switching the supply, or more properly switching the contactor that starts it. You will need a licensed electrician to touch 120VAC, especially since its likely on a Circuit Breaker and not a RCBO.    Disclaimer, I am an electrical designer not an electrician, so the legality of touching these units yourself to do LV work i am unsure about.

They ALL should turn off when you turn them, completely, whether you dim to off or a single press to off.    I just tested both a Linear PD300Z and a GE 12718 with a 60W incandescent bulb, to test this, and both actions turned the bulb to zero or completely off. Next I plugged in a 7W LED and this is where most people get concerned.  LED's do not dim to zero off, most of them go to around 5-20% only unless you use single button press to off, when they normally will dim to zero.  That is pretty standard for all switches, although they do perform with a little more variance when using hardwired dimmers as opposed to dimming modules.  Hope that helps!

I don't use it, but I'd still do it because I'm almost certainly not going to own the house forever and it'll make it more appealing to a buyer. And if you're building the house, putting the wiring in should have negligible cost."
homeautomation,3d6a4g,Spearhartt,6,Tue Jul 14 18:44:08 2015 UTC,"Run wire everywhere and do it now while building, but if you need to keep to a budget there's nothing wrong with running CAT5e, and there's no reason to run RG6 anywhere unless you are planning to have satellite/cable.  Double up your CAT runs to all of your even possible TV locations, so you can have network AND potentially a balun. Make sure to identify a safe, dry, and climate controlled location for your rack. Assuming your end game is to one day have a fully automated house, distributed audio and video should be included in your plan.  Consider going ahead and running the audio wire to all possible speaker locations in your house, at least two pairs of 16-2 or one pair of 16-4 to each room. Leave it tacked up in the ceiling but document where and what stud bay.  Make sure to never run audio parallel to electrical. Always cross at a 90 degree angle and don't put any volume controls closer than 8"" to a light switch. This is all to prevent any buzzing or feedback later on.   For any rooms with home theatres/surround sound, keep in mind you can go either in ceiling, in wall, or surface mount for typical 5.1/7.1 systems. For the newer Dolby Atmos systems keep in mind that you don't want your typical surrounds in the ceiling, do them as surface mounts or in-walls. The reason for that is because the Atmos system has a specific slot for ceiling speakers and you would be messing with your soundstage by having too many speakers in the ceiling.  As far as gang boxes go, for all your low voltage wire you don't have to worry about getting deep boxes, in fact you can get OPEN boxes that have a loop in the back for zipping your wires to.  Once all your wire is ran you can go as slow as you want and not have to worry much about extensive wiring costs. Now your next step is to either create your own ecosystem or find a major player to bring into your house and get everything going.  Some things you may want to consider for the future: - Audio Matrix - Video Matrix - Centralized IR control (Control4, Crestron, etc.) - NAS drive for music/movies - HTPC/Server  TL;DR: wire now and wire more than you think you'll need. It may get expensive, but it'll be a quarter of the cost of a retrofit later."

The hub is going to be located in an unfinished basement and then when the basement is finished will be set up in a dedicated home theater closet   How could I put all of my cable boxes in the basement. Just have hdmi runs? Or is there a more efficient way now"
homeautomation,3d6a4g,Spearhartt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:59:15 2015 UTC,"You can use a video matrix to send all your hdmi runs over CAT5, and you can also have send/receive IR over the baluns.  I personally would want CAT5 drops everywhere. If you have network somewhere you can add any devices in that location for the future."
homeautomation,3d6a4g,dfmz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:26:21 2015 UTC,"Also, run your cables yourself if you're DIY. It's not hard at all and it'll save you a ton."
homeautomation,3d6a4g,Spearhartt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:27:06 2015 UTC,"It's not hard at all and it'll save you a ton.   Yes, it will save you a ton, but it's only ""not hard"" when you know what you guarantee 're doing. Network cable has to be laid in very specific manners so as to operate correctly and remain interference-free (high voltage cables and network cables don't mix, for example). Ask you electrical if you're not sure."
homeautomation,3d6a4g,dfmz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:26:42 2015 UTC,Follow the same guidelines with your data as you do with the audio cables. Cross at 90 degrees and don't run parallel. I work for a company that builds these houses every day. We've never had trouble with interference and I promise we don't spend too much time planning out how the cable is routed. There's just things you avoid and you're golden.
homeautomation,3d6a4g,Spearhartt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:37:06 2015 UTC,"There's just things you avoid and you're golden.   Exactly. The thing is, most people aren't familiar with the ins and outs of electrical/audio/network cabling.  My job is to install very high-end home automation, networking, audio and security system. I see bad cabling that interferes with my job every single day, occasionally even from big names in the business. My point is, most people don't realize that the way you install cable is governed by precise rules and the type of cable you choose has an impact on how your system performs. To me, this is far from a trivial issue."
homeautomation,3d6a4g,dfmz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:14:22 2015 UTC,"Call it what you want dude. We work in the same field, and I'm telling you I've never seen it be an issue in our installs. There's a handful of principles to follow and that's it. We do Crestron and AMX installs all the time. From high end residential to large scale commercial and I promise we don't fret over more than just keeping it all at a 90 and not running parallel."
homeautomation,3d6a4g,Spearhartt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:18:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not calling it anything. I'm just pointing out that we often run into issues caused by poor cabling. Sometimes it's due to a poor choice of cable, sometimes is a half-assed job laying the cable and sometimes it's just fraud, plain and simple.  Here's is an example of fraud: in case you can't figure it out from the pic, you're looking at ""fixed"" CAT 6 cable. We caught this one just last week in Turkey (the country). Upon closer inspection, there were ten more like this one. These cables were meant to transport an HDBaseT signal. Needless to say, all of these cables had to be replaced. It's one among many examples of things that can go wrong in a cabling job. Laying cables too close to a heat source, laying network cables next to a transformer, etc. All examples of poor workmanship.  My greater point is: cable is king, so long as it's been properly installed. :)"

homeautomation,3d6a4g,steevel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:58:22 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't know a good quick guide off the top of my head. I can check around after work and see if I can find you something.
homeautomation,3d6a4g,Spearhartt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:04:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks my plan was to run 2 cat6 runs to each bedroom, office and living room   Good start.   Should I add rooms like the laundry room, pantry etc???   Look at it this way: cable is cheap in general and a lot cheaper to install when the wall and ceilings are open that when they're closed up. So, trust the A/V installers and spend a little more money pulling cables everywhere you might need them later.  Keep mind that cable is king and that it's a lot more reliable, much faster and interference-proof than RF (wifi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc.).  Don't use Cat5. Cat6 is the standard today and yes, do pull coax cable, even if you don't need it today, you might tomorrow. It might also be a selling point when you flip the house a few years down the road."

Could you clarify what balun, audio matrix and video matrix are and what they bring to the table? My kitchen/bathroom/upstairs project is currently on hold while I figure out exactly what to put where :-)"
homeautomation,3d6a4g,SparrowDC,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:39:59 2015 UTC,A matrix takes all your sources and switches them against all your end points. It can function as both a switch and a splitter. An 8x8 hdmi matrix can send 1 bluray source to 8 TV's or to only 2 of them and another source to the other six. Audio works the same way.
homeautomation,3d6a4g,judgemonroe,6,Tue Jul 14 11:40:38 2015 UTC,I just built my house a year ago. Run all the fucking network cable you possibly can. Then run more.
homeautomation,3d6a4g,MJAT,2,Mon Jul 13 23:29:24 2015 UTC,"So for those of us even more noob-ish, I am perplexed that in our world of wireless communication that all the comments revolve around running cable throughout the home. I am planning to build a house in a couple years, so could someone please simply explain why a home needs so much cable with everything being wireless these days?"
homeautomation,3d6a4g,J_Pelletier,4,Tue Jul 14 03:12:44 2015 UTC,"Wired connections are better than wireless connections, across the board, and there's no reason to suspect this will be changing. This is true of audio and video applications, as well as general networking. AC wifi is fast but the penetration at 5ghz is terrible.  When the opportunity exists to install copper in the walls, there's just no substitute.   Edit: security sensors actually work pretty well over wireless. But they're necessarily bulkier and have to battery powered. I've had them for over a decade here without any false alarms or missed triggers. But then their RF is relatively low so they have good penetration. Same with automation protocols like zwave."

homeautomation,3d6a4g,HighNoon03,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:26:23 2015 UTC,I'm installing Ubiquiti UniFi AP in my house to improve wireless signals and those use POE (power over ethernet) so it's really nice to have cables everywhere. This way I have Zero-Handoff Roaming everywhere with very good signals and speed since each AP are wired to my TOUGHSwitch
homeautomation,3d6a4g,GreatTragedy,2,Fri Jul 17 14:17:49 2015 UTC,"Echoing what others have said: CAT6 to each room, RG6 anywhere you ever plan on putting a TV, audio cabling for sound (either music or surround), HDMI v2.0a cabling (v2.0a/HDCP 2.2/18 Gbps) to media areas, low voltage cabling for security.  A minimum of 2 (or even 4) CAT6 to every occupied room is a minimum now: most baluns will use up 2 (e.g. an HDMI over CAT6). I'm in a condo and I ended up running 20 jacks:   6 in the living room: 2 behind the wall-mounted TV (TV, Ambilight), 4 behind the TV stand (Playstation, future HomeRunHD) 2 in the bedroom 4 in the office/2nd bedroom 2 in the office closet (for the printer) 6 on the breakfast bar: 5 for the router (VLANs), 1 for the all-in-one   If you're doing IP cameras, wire in additional CAT6 runs so you can run power-over-Ethernet and a network DVR instead of coaxial.  Unfortunately, I didn't have access before they put up the drywall else I would also have done:    USB extensions to certain areas: e.g. plugging in a USB stick in the living room port that connects to the media server in the closet low voltage power cabling: to run LED lighting instead of having to use individual adapters everywhere   You can check out my build at www.TheSmartHome.ca."
homeautomation,3d6a4g,HighNoon03,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:13:54 2015 UTC,"I just had a house built 6 months ago. Everyone will tell you to run conduit (usually PVC) to every room in the house but if you're using  a typical builder that will be crazy expensive. I used a very reputable builder and they were reluctant to even quote me for conduit. It would have ended up being $7k-$8k. It's a large house, but that number is still outrageous.  Having a million Cat5e drops is also nice but you have to balance cost with necessity. My builder charged $150 PER CABLE, even if 4 cables were going to the same wall location and all run together it would have been $600. My dreams of running 4-6 Cat5e to each room were quickly crushed.  Good luck!"
homeautomation,3d6a4g,judgemonroe,2,Tue Jul 14 01:07:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's kind of crazy how much they charge. They usually won't let you do the runs yourself before drywall goes up either. It's kind of weak."
homeautomation,3d6a4g,judgemonroe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:20:42 2015 UTC,Exactly. I asked and was told I couldn't do any runs myself. I thought about doing it anyway or paying off the LV contractor to do some extra runs but decided it wasn't worth the risk. Maybe with a fully-custom builder things would be different.  I really wonder if all of these people that recommend conduit/cat6/speaker wire everywhere really have that in their own houses... I only recall seeing one post ever where a guy had conduit to each room.
homeautomation,3d6a4g,ussurfer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:50:24 2015 UTC,"I put 6 cat6 and 2 rg6 in every bedroom and ""media location"", some conduit but not as much as I wanted, and a bunch of security runs. Speakers run to six zones.  So it's possible, but it's really easier to write it down than to get it done.  Asking about DIY LV work came early in the process. If they hadn't allowed it I would have kept shopping for someone who did. Luckily my builder isn't one of the Chinese-menu bulk builders so I had a lot of input and control over the build without it being ""custom"".   Edit: the builder did express surprise at how much cable I ran and agreed that I saved a fortune."
homeautomation,3d6a4g,dfmz,3,Tue Jul 14 13:43:01 2015 UTC,I am fortunate that the builder is going to let me run all the low voltage cable that  I want with no problems at all.  Will save me a small fortune
