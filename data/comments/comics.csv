comics,3dxol4,The_Derpening,20,Mon Jul 20 16:08:36 2015 UTC,The answer to that is to just take out a book and read. The cat will immediately hop back on in between your eyes and the book and fall back asleep. You then put book away and take your nap. Everyone wins.

I believe that there are about a dozen common different kinds of breast cancer, which means at least a dozen different optimal routes for therapy.  Identified cancer + proper therapy for that type might slap another 20% on your odds for successful outcome and significantly delayed mortality.  And another weird part is that all of these efforts desperately need volunteers with breast cancer for their human trials.  So, if you get breast cancer, your best bet is to:  1)  Rent an efficiency apartment in a breast cancer research node. 2)  Get the most accurate diagnosis of your particular cancer that you can. 3)  Shop around the research efforts to get the best deal for therapy. 4)  Never, ever procrastinate or allow anyone else to waste your time.

Not every comic has to have a joke per se, but in this case it's a satire of how politicians are so trigger happy when it comes to talking about what ""the people/the average Joe"" wants and thinks and are more than happy to project their opinions on an otherwise silenced electorate (like in a dictatorship, NK for example).

It barely took the edge off so that I could stop screaming from the pain, and made me itchy; but no ""high"" feeling at all. Was so bummed after hearing about all these experiences.  Although I'm pretty sure it wasn't going in IV very well because my arm ballooned to twice its size compared to the other. They never did anything about that either.

comics,3dua7r,CordycepsFungus,2,Mon Jul 20 04:07:06 2015 UTC,"The iv thing may have something to do with it. But the itching sounds like you definitely got some.  Itching is the after effect though,  not when you are high. In my case I had been on a machine that gave me some whenever I pushed the button.  It works well but didn't really give enough to feel high.  After a few days they 'weaned ' me by giving shots on demand.  I don't think I had been pushing the button much because the weaning shot is what knocked me for a loop. They say that drug addiction is all about chasing that first high and you'll never get there again.  I think they're right.  I got several more shots while there but none like that first one. And all were the same dose (I asked )."
comics,3dua7r,coolshifts,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:24:10 2015 UTC,"Itching is a known side effect of morphine.    As far as not getting that high feeling, it is well commonly known (among health professionals) that you do not get ""a high"" if you are in a lot of pain, because the body uses every bit of the morphine to manage it.   I'm sorry I couldn't find a study online to back up that tidbit - it's more of a ""truism of nursing"".    Also, it is likely that your dosage was insufficient.  Many places have a cap on how much morphine they can provide, but information is becoming available that shows that for those in extreme pain, the maximum dosage does nothing.  There are studies for this one.  Here's one I found."

Some old biddies (her words) were nearby, critiquing her technique in not-really-quiet whispers. Things like, ""Young mothers always hold the baby like that..."" and ""The child clearly needs to be burped more often,"" etc.  My mom got pissed, walked over to one of them, held out the baby, and the lady took it by automatic reaction. My mom went in and sat through the rest of the service. She came out to find two older women with an infant who had not stopped crying the entire time. She took her baby back and left."

People sometimes see things that you don't. I've definitely gotten unsolicited advice that I thought was good.  Obviously, if someone won't back off after you say ""I got this"" that is a different story. And I am sure people have relatives that will do exactly that.

comics,3dvg5t,icecoldteddy,6,Sun Jul 19 23:21:52 2015 UTC,"It could be a defense.  A worthwhile discussion to have. But the main focus is obviously, I hope, on the hypocrisy.  Edit because of down votes:  I'm saying it could be a defense used by those who support the Confederate flag. It wouldn't make them right. It is just something they could say. A conversation on the topic would be a valid debate to have."
comics,3dvg5t,lackflag,4,Sun Jul 19 23:23:50 2015 UTC,"It is an interesting joke because it works both ways in the abstract. Of course, when you get to the specifics of what the flags might be represnting, things get a bit more comlicated.  edit: Thanks for the downvote! Pretty shitty comment, am I right? Clearly, I was just trolling whatever side you're on in this imagined debate you are having with nobody."
comics,3dvg5t,grizzlyking,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:08:40 2015 UTC,I think it reads much more as a defense than hypocrisy unless this is parodying a news story or something similar that i missed

comics,3dvg5t,finalcut,3,Mon Jul 20 13:05:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't think people were trying to ban the confederate flag from society; but rather they are trying to get our government to not fly the flag on official state-owned property.  That's a big difference.  I don't really see why a government in and of the US should fly a flag that represents treason against the US. Equally, I don't think the government should fly a flag that represents the subjugation of part of it's people either.  The government SHOULD actually try to be looking out for the people.  However, if some random person wants to fly the confederate flag on the back of their pickup, on in their front yard, or on their shirt, or whatever - their welcome to.    Various stores have, in an effort to be non-offensive, removed the flag but that has been a voluntary action. I do not believe anyone is attempting to pass a law that makes owning or selling a confederate flag illegal. Such a law would clearly violate the constitutional protection of speech and would not survive legal challenge."
comics,3dvg5t,MyNameIsDon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:10:33 2015 UTC,Shouldn't they be ordered to remove those israeli flags then too?
comics,3dvg5t,GodShapedBullet,3,Mon Jul 20 16:19:03 2015 UTC,"Who is ""they""?  Also, if you want to start a campaign against US government buildings flying Israeli flags feel free... But I don't see why anyone would need to wait for your success to remove Confederate flags from government buildings.  You are kinda just introducing non sequiturs here!"
comics,3dvg5t,MyNameIsDon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:00:22 2015 UTC,"A surprising amount of government officials. All that Israeli violence is certainly controversial, anf if government buildings shouldn't display flags for political opinions, then they should probably take down the Israeli flags too.   I don't care about the implications of the flags themselves,  I'm just saying you can't just favor one thing because it's popular. There's more than just the confederate flag hanging around, so it's either any can stay or all must go. That would probably include SPECTRUM/pride flags, POW flags, and any other generally accepted flags. The price of freedom of expression is a few racist assholes being slightly more visible to more sensible people. Sounds good to me. If the people hate the display, vite in a guy who will take it down."
comics,3dvg5t,GodShapedBullet,2,Mon Jul 20 22:20:50 2015 UTC,They did that!  The confederate flags are being brought down because legislatures are voting to take them down!  What's your issue here?

comics,3dvg5t,WendyLRogers3,7,Mon Jul 20 02:41:35 2015 UTC,"This raises a very good issue, that when Mexican citizens migrate to the US looking for work, only some want to integrate and become American citizens.  Others want to retain their Mexican citizenship, and send much of their earnings to their family that remain in Mexico.  Unlike other waves of immigrants that are in a three generational pattern:  first generation old world, second generation not really a part of either the old world or the new one, and third generation that are fully new world; Mexican integration is multi generational all at the same time, and in the same family.  Mix and match.  For example, grandparents that are US citizens but do not speak English.  Some parents that are legal and others that are not, and half integrated.  And children that are illegal, but fully integrated and who have no connection with Mexico.  But in the final analysis, if they want the benefits of citizenship, then they need to become citizens, while enjoying their ethnic cultural identity, to patriotically embrace their new country as Americans."

They were termed The Boxers by westerners and were part of a nationalist movement that attempted to fight back against western influence in China:  ""By the late 1890s, a Chinese secret group, the Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists (“I-ho-ch’uan” or “Yihequan”), had begun carrying out regular attacks on foreigners and Chinese Christians. (The rebels performed calisthenics rituals and martial arts that they believed would give them the ability to withstand bullets and other forms of attack. Westerners referred to these rituals as shadow boxing, leading to the Boxers nickname.)""

Katanas deserve much better than that. Much, much better than that.I should know what I'm talking about. I myself commissioned a genuine katana in Japan for 2,400,000 Yen (that's about $20,000) and have been practicing with it for almost 2 years now. I can even cut slabs of solid steel with my katana.Japanese smiths spend years working on a single katana and fold it up to a million times to produce the finest blades known to mankind.Katanas are thrice as sharp as European swords and thrice as hard for that matter too. Anything a longsword can cut through, a katana can cut through better. I'm pretty sure a katana could easily bisect a knight wearing full plate with a simple vertical slash.Ever wonder why medieval Europe never bothered conquering Japan? That's right, they were too scared to fight the disciplined Samurai and their katanas of destruction. Even in World War II, American soldiers targeted the men with the katanas first because their killing power was feared and respected."

comics,3drrq6,nasirjk,4,Sun Jul 19 04:58:47 2015 UTC,"I know this is just a joke, but to lay out the facts, katanas were nearly worthless.   If you've got a malnourished, poorly armed, completely unarmored peasant to harass, that's a fine weapon to do it. Well, ninjas were malnourished, poorly armed, completely unarmored peasants and they took on samurai, so maybe that's not quite true. If you want to ritualistically kill yourself, the weapon will work wonders, it is just perfect for slowly, painfully killing yourself. Now, if you were fighting an actual warrior with with armour, you'd put down the katana and get a real weapon.  The reason they were used in WWII was for ceremony, nobody planned to rush into battle with a katana against machine gun fire. But since nobody on the other side had armour or proper close combat weapons, they could come in handy in some remarkably specific and rare circumstances."
comics,3drrq6,Pinksister,3,Sun Jul 19 05:26:33 2015 UTC,"Katanas were not completely useless. They weren't fantastic swords, in general, no, but they were quite good for the poor-quality ore medieval Japanese weaponsmiths had to work with. Katanas were designed to be slashing weapons, and a good blow could do serious damage, even to another armored samurai. Aside from that, it's hard to call any sharp piece of iron completely useless, but that's just me being pedantic.  Also, ninjas weren't really malnourished peasants. In fact, I've read a lot of sources that claim they were usually lower-level samurai. Regardless, taking out samurai wasn't really a concern for them, as they were almost always used for scouting and reconnaissance, rather than assassination, and if they were in a fight it usually meant their mission had gone wrong somewhere down the line. And the assassinations that did occur were often expected to be suicide missions. But anyway, whether or not a ninja could take out a samurai would depend on which one was a better fighter. If there were ninjas that were peasants, they probably couldn't, since peasants spent all their time farming and the ones that were pressed into military service were generally given only the most basic training. Also, and I know you didn't say this, but ninjas didn't wear all black. That would make them stick out like a sore thumb, which is a terrible idea for a spy."
comics,3drrq6,featherfooted,2,Sun Jul 19 06:24:17 2015 UTC,"Yup. The biggest two problems Japan had in advancing sword design was the lack of high quality steel, and the isolation they experienced. Both meant that you usually weren't going up against someone in plate armor, or the like."

That, combined with the fact that everything expands to allow a baby to pass through, which is going to be a lot larger than a penis, and pretty much any trauma that is able to be seen would be if a weapon/something non biological was being used.  As for anal trauma, that's usually easier to see, but if it's just regular ol' anal sex, there isn't going to be much.  I've handled a fair number of sexual assault cases and have never seen any sexual damage, even in cases where the children were 6 years old. (but in the ""better"" ones, they had contracted STDs so we had some forensic basis).   Most sex assault cases are a woman/child saying they were sexually assaulted....the end.

I'm gonna bet that's why people prefer imgur, because they don't get the shitty popover ads using lightbox.  EDIT: The bonus comic kinda reinforces my point."
comics,3dqb34,Dutchcrafter,32,Sat Jul 18 21:58:00 2015 UTC,The only problem I have with links to the site of the creators is that some of them are absolute garbage. They are slow or cluttered with things you are not interested in. Most image sharing website just show the comic and nothing else. Sometimes something related to it or an album it's from but it usually takes up so little space that it's no big deal.  It would be great if everyone shared the source of not just comics but anything on reddit really. I mean even if you copy and paste it on a sharing website at least place the source in the comments or something. But the sad truth about linking directly to the creators site often results in a sub par viewing experience for the reader. Get burned often enough and people stop clicking on those links all together. In other words: bad apples spoil the bunch.
comics,3dqb34,Dutchcrafter,18,Sat Jul 18 17:15:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a bittersweet state of affairs right now for comic creators. Audiences not only like free, but immediate. That is hard to compete with, unless you offer bonus material (which I do).  In the past, I have direct-linked to the post on my site because I run ads on it (good beer money). I've had a few Soopah strips rise to #1, but they don't stay there for long. An imgur-hosted comic quickly replaces it.  This particular strip (hosted on imgur, obviously) is a test to see how much interest the comic can drum up to send people back to the site. So far, the numbers are about 1/20th of what they would be if I direct-linked. However, everyone who has stopped by has stuck around a bit (low bounce-rate, high pages-per-session). Quality > quantity, I guess."

comics,3dqb34,flexgap,3,Sat Jul 18 19:30:04 2015 UTC,"On my phone, what happens with most sites is that all the side stuff loads but not the comic.  SMBC Comics loads fully every single time rapidly, and he has that hidden button thing. So it annoys me when he posts to imgur.  There's another comic that does hidden and loads quickly, and I prefer the website there too but there's a third which has a hidden panel but doesn't load properly and I just skip the comic altogether. Can't be arsed sitting here waiting for my progress bar to make that last 10% that loads the actual comic and then clicking in the hidden spot and waiting for nothing to appear.  It's not that I hate the comic. It's just that I can look at another one instead that doesn't involve me staring at nothing for 10 s first."

comics,3dqy21,stepintoyou,4,Sat Jul 18 20:10:38 2015 UTC,"Indeed I do! When I was working on my Masters, I helped draw an entire Coursera lecture on the topic. You can take the class here:   https://www.coursera.org/course/innovation   There's a lot more to the idea of how creativity comes about, but, in most cases, solutions emerge when we have a box to work in. If ask to solve a problem, we are more likely to be able to solve it if we know such things as when the deadline is, what the clients want, what are budgets at.   Another example is if you were an artist, and were asked to create a mural. In order to get paid, you had to paint something I liked in a timely manner. If told to do so without any guidelines, you would be looking at the dreaded blank, white canvas. You might end up going through analysis paralysis because you don't know what I wanted. Now, on the other hand, if I said,""  I need a mural painted of the New York skyline with these colors by this date and your budget is this and add these motifs in"", you would probably be more confident of what you paint and why.   Creativity is actually a process. In the process, there is a ""Blue sky"" moment when everything is basically allowed without criticism but eventually you have to come to a physical solution. Constraints allow us to create with confidence and justification and funnel down ""what could be"" into ""what can be.""  :)"
comics,3dqy21,bosco10382,2,Sat Jul 18 21:44:20 2015 UTC,"Love this. I'm writing my MA thesis now and the idea that we need boundaries in order to creatively learn might be another citation to add. The irony, specifically, is really neat; we need the box in order to think outside of it. It would be interesting to think about the degree to which constraints are needed. There must be a fine line between too few and too many constraints, similar to the (somewhat antiquated, mind you) idea in education called the zone of proximal development, suggesting that someone learns best when the challenge is ""just right,"" not too difficult and not too easy.  Love it. Thanks :)"

comics,3dmjuw,mikeball,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:33:59 2015 UTC,As long as you do it properly it's not against code. Something like that certainly isn't hard but I can think of a few mistakes a homeowner might make if they do it themselves.

comics,3dmjuw,mikeball,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:17:52 2015 UTC,"Among other things yes. Also it's probably 8/3 AWG which means you have both a red and a black hot. You can either make a split receptacle or cap one hot off and just do a normal receptacle; if you decide to do a split receptacle then you have to break the tab on the hot side of the plug during installation. You also need to get a 15 amp breaker since your new receptacle is only rated for 15 amps. If you're doing a split receptacle you need to get a 2 pole breaker.   Of course this is based purely on a hypothetical situation and other things might need to be considered as well. And people wonder why I won't do quotes over the phone.    needs to be 'certified'?    Technically, yes. At least in Alberta code dictates that any and all modifications to your electrical system need to be inspected by a city inspector. This isn't really followed too closely and most inspectors would be annoyed if they drove all the way to your house to inspect a plug."
comics,3dmjuw,duartmac86,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:58:25 2015 UTC,"Ya I just capped off one of the hots on either end. The wire was running to the breaker box but wasn't connected to anything.

Moderate tans are natural for people who spend time outdoors, if you don't want a sudden change from tan to pale where your clothes usually are, you probably want to go tanning at the beach or at a parlor to ensure you have a universal color across your skin, the only other way to do that is to avoid the sun entirely. Otherwise you end up with much darker arms and legs below where your shorts are, and pale as fuck body and upper legs/butt.   You're still going to have tan lines regardless unless you tan in the nude, but some people do that.  Not all tans are orange or a dark leather color, don't act like they are."

comics,3diihe,ERR0R404namenotfound,8,Thu Jul 16 19:26:41 2015 UTC,Yes because every joke can only be done once AND NEVER AGAIN. I mean honestly when has there ever been an occasion where two people thought of similar jokes. I mean in all the years that thats been a warning on those pill bottles that person alone was the first person to ever make that joke.   TLDR: Grow the fuck up.

comics,3diihe,ERR0R404namenotfound,5,Thu Jul 16 20:11:54 2015 UTC,There's a difference between blatant joke stealing and making a similar joke as a comic they may have never even seen before. Not to mention that the jokes been used many times before that comic even existed.

comics,3diihe,ERR0R404namenotfound,5,Thu Jul 16 19:11:35 2015 UTC,Ok wow you're basically using the Hitler was fallacy right now just because some jackass said something similar doesn't make my argument wrong these are different circumstances and a different type of media. Also that's a very small portion of my argument you're trying to discredit.
comics,3diihe,RichardBachman,-3,Thu Jul 16 18:20:12 2015 UTC,"I made a Carlos Mencia joke.  You said it was different because Zach had probably never seen this comic and it's just similar not the same, which is exactly the defense Carlos Mencia used.  What the fuck does that have to do with Hitler?  And since we're on the subject, why are you automatically assuming Zach wouldn't do something like that?  You have zero facts yet you're defending him.  I think it's safe to say your opinion may be a little biased.  I don't know one way or the other.  Maybe he stole it, maybe he read it 2 years ago and just forgot about it, maybe it was completely unintentional.  Don't know, don't care.  I just posted a link.  Sorry if it painted one of your favorite webcomic artists in a bad light but getting mad at me for pointing it out doesn't change anything."
comics,3diihe,darkshaddow42,3,Thu Jul 16 18:32:42 2015 UTC,You're assuming Carlos Mencia told the whole truth and not just what people wanted to hear. Obviously that's what he's going to say when accused of stealing.
comics,3diihe,ERR0R404namenotfound,2,Thu Jul 16 18:59:04 2015 UTC,"First off I didn't say probably I said might and I said it as an addition to my point not the entire point. ""What the fuck does that have to do with Hitler?"" nothing im saying the tactic you're using is the same tactic as people who say shit like ""Hitler was a socialist"" in attempt to discredit an argument.  ""why are you automatically assuming Zach wouldn't do something like that?"" why automatically assume he would?  ""I don't know one way or the other. Maybe he stole it, maybe he read it 2 years ago and just forgot about it maybe it was completely unintentional"" and here is why im upset. You're arguing that the original comic has some sort of fucking copyright on a joke that Ive heard thousands of times before they even existed.  I honestly don't really give a shit about smbc hell I didn't even know the creators name till you mentioned it its just I hate the stupid fucking ""Calling out"" bullshit people do here, I mean really is it so hard to believe that they came up with such a simple fucking joke on their own. I mean I could understand some fucking complex joke that they had to have copied but this is literally a joke about fucking male boner appreciation and popular pill warnings.   Also the tone shift from sarcastic anger to somewhat depressed is making me feel bad sooo yeah sorry if I put you in a bad mood."

You could be a pauper, a king, a homosexual, mentally challenged, a woman, a man, a person with androginous features or genitalia, etc. So, you have to make the rules fair for everyone, in theory.  One failure I perceive with this example is that sometimes people fail to be empathetic and will create rules that punish homosexuals, for example, because they believe that they would deserve punishment if they happened to be homosexuals."

comics,3df0qc,Word-slinger,5,Thu Jul 16 03:07:49 2015 UTC,"Regarding the example of doctors and nurses, I don't think it would happen because the scope is much larger: you would want to plan an hospital to run as well as possible, because in fact you have greater chances to be a farmer and a farmer needs an hospital to run as it should in case he/she needs it.  Americans tend to defend the fairness of the wealthy, but I think the flaw with this method is a very different one: unprotected minorities.  For example: if you are born as an american-indian (which has low probability), with your own culture and language, chances are that rules have not been thought for your specific case. But it does not mean that you deserve to be forgotten in society... in this case (and I thought a lot about it because I am in a vaguely similar situation) is to be in a different society with a different set of rules that apply to the specific minority so it does not get bulldozed by the larger society."

For a TV show a series is rarely finished before broadcast. A movie can take a few years to complete.  Can you start with a few smaller units? Complete those and see how it goes.  On the story aspect, it depends on you. You sound like you might be a perfectionist. Would you be able to move forward if you don't have the full script completed? My own take is to go with an outline and let the story develop organically.  I have some experience with a drawing and writing project (but it wasn't a comic book or web comic). I think I would have been less stressed out if I had the entire project fully written and drawn before releasing it (which I did as I went)...but would I have ever finished (being a minor perfectionist as well)?"

Just like you'd roll with unexpected things in your real life. Have you figured out how to make the best of what the world has thrown at you? Hah, me neither. But it's your story so it should be just a bit easier to control. If you think of how much control Lucas wanted and got and how much his control has not made people happier with his works, you can feel more at ease letting the universe have your work of art even if it's not ""perfect"".  One thought that comes to mind is that you can leave some issues of missing foreshadowing for future issues. Like, look back issues that go into more detail. There's always room for continuations in a great story.  Come back later and ask again. Or try some other subs or forums. I hope you get more feedback. Good luck."

All those rainbows with purples (including the one in the comic) are a waay too common misconception. This is a real ""rainbow""/spectrum. For our eyes to perceive purple we need to receive a mix of red and blue. No star emits the right mix of blue and red (there's always too much blue, look how the graph in the first video/commentaboveyours rises to the right/blue). These stars emit lots of ultra-violet and x-rays but we can't see those.  Purple only exist in our minds. To be honest (this is more about neuroscience and philosophy/qualia) colors aren't a direct quality of wavelengths. Your eyes/mind will perceive green even if your eyes react to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" wavelengths simultaneously (mixing a smaller and bigger wavelength won't cause a middle wavelength btw). Colors are more linked to brain-states. That's why synesthetes can ""see"" colors from music.   Pink/rose is a whitish red, brown is a blackish orange. Purple/violet exist when the two ends of the visible spectrum get ""connected"" in our mind, so our mind sort of closes the visible spectrum (a line, a linear thing) in a circle, the color wheel."

comics,3ddg9t,calvindog717,2,Thu Jul 16 00:18:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah the wheat explanation was very confusing. I think what he means is that the frequencies that scatter the most are higher in the blue frequency and have a decreasing drop in both sides. That doesn't mean that infrared/x-rays aren't present, but they're much less representative of the frequencies scattered in the sky than blue.   This is also why the sky isn't deep blue, the other colors are also present and lighten the already present deep blue to create sky blue."

comics,3ddg9t,Krail,10,Wed Jul 15 18:53:57 2015 UTC,"why isn't the sky violet?   Because, although the most common frequency is violet light, what we end up seeing is a ""weighted average"" of all the different frequencies of light, with ""weight"" corresponding to the extent of scattering.  That weighted average is processed as ""sky blue"", which on the scale from violet to red is pretty far towards the violet end of the spectrum."

comics,3ddg9t,dirckb,3,Wed Jul 15 18:49:04 2015 UTC,"Why isn't this answer correct? I mean, it abstracts away an entire layer but essentially doesn't any answer hide some of the technical details? At some point And isn't that enough for a really young kid?   Saying ""because of Rayleigh scattering"" is just as much hiding some technical details unless you're willing to explain photon scattering and quantum energy levels."
comics,3ddg9t,fuzzybunn,21,Wed Jul 15 19:18:52 2015 UTC,"Why isn't this answer correct?   It isn't correct because the sky ""is"" red or yellow or orange when you look towards a sunset. One person can be looking at the same section of sky as you are and see a completely different color.  It's like looking out a window with a blue background and saying ""the window is blue."" No. The window is clear, you are seeing the color coming from behind it.  It's a similar thing with the sky. You aren't seeing the color of the sky, you are seeing the light waves that have been scattered towards you.  I get your point about ""hiding technical details,"" but I think that the statement made by dirckb, while funny, is actually untrue."
comics,3ddg9t,EatATaco,2,Wed Jul 15 20:19:43 2015 UTC,"I think it is arguably correct.  Color is the scattering of light waves, yes?  Air, like water, isn't completely transparent, or else the sky would be black.  Water is less transparent than air, so it doesn't have to be terribly deep before it is visibly blue.  The color of the sky does change when the angle of the light changes, so does that make sky a prism?  Hmm..."
comics,3ddg9t,dirckb,3,Wed Jul 15 20:48:51 2015 UTC,"We tend to call something's color based on what wavelengths of light it reflects, not what it scatters. Obvious exceptions are the sky and (to a lesser extent) water. But I think the latter two come more from an early misconception of how these things work just sticking with the language.  Certainly, even though a window is not 100% transparent either, you wouldn't refer to it as anything but ""clear."" Maybe a better example is a prism. It is going to refract white light into lots of different colors, but if you just look at one, you would probably call it ""white"" or ""clear.""  Furthermore, obviously, the sky is highly transparent because you can see clouds, the sun and the stars through it quite easily.   The color of the sky does change when the angle of the light changes, so does that make sky a prism?    I wouldn't think so as the definition of prism is pretty specific, and (I believe) works on refraction, not scattering."
comics,3ddg9t,EatATaco,2,Wed Jul 15 21:37:01 2015 UTC,"Scattering is reflection.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_scattering  ""Most objects that one sees are visible due to light scattering from their surfaces""  Air scatters light and is therefore visible.  It is mostly transparent, but only mostly.  Something is a specific color because it reflects more of the light that our eyes detect as that color. Air reflects more higher frequency light and let's lower frequency light pass through more easily; a solid object would absorb the light that isn't reflected. We see blue because the reflected light is scattered and bouncing around in all directions, not bouncing directly back to the source.  Sunlight changes color as the sun passes through more atmosphere; near sunrise/sunset the angle of the light increases the effective depth of the atmosphere, and more of the higher frequency light is reflected, and reflected thoroughly enough that it effectively blocked and doesn't reach the ground.  So air is a filter that reflects (""scatters"") and passes light differently, depending on how thick it is.  The sky is also a prism, because it refracts light and can change the apparent position of objects.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction  ""blue is scattered more than other colors"" http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/  ""blue is scattered more than other colors""  == ""air is blue""."
comics,3ddg9t,dirckb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:00:52 2015 UTC,"You have a few facts wrong, but correcting them is inconsequential to the discussion.  Using your exact logic, windows are the color of whatever is behind them, and mirrors are the color of whatever they are currently reflecting.  If that is your definition of the color of something, then you are right, the air is actually blue. But it is also red and orange and yellow and black and white and . . .well, every color because any color can get to you through the air."

comics,3dbvq3,SplintPunchbeef,-1,Wed Jul 15 16:14:35 2015 UTC,"I feel the original has a lot better pacing, and reminds me a lot of classic comics rather than internet ones. The ones you and the other people made are much shorter than provide less of an emotional experience due to their shortened lengths. Plus you ruined the comic maker's comedic timing."
comics,3dbvq3,onFilm,10,Wed Jul 15 15:00:37 2015 UTC,twice as short? half as long? english is strange.. :)
comics,3dbvq3,kradek,3,Wed Jul 15 12:34:59 2015 UTC,"TL;DR Half is a discrete value, short is a reference. Twice as short must refer to a shorter version of the original, so Glampkoo used it incorrectly.  People will technically understand ""twice as short"" as half if they already know the lengths of the original and short version, but it still doesn't make sense because the original object isn't short of anything. You can calculate how long the original object is (12) if you know that the shorter version is half (6).   Something can be ""twice as short"" if it is referring to something else that is shorter (6 panels) than the original (12 panels). To say it fully, a 0 panel comic is twice the amount shorter than the short comic (6) is of the original (12). You are subtracting 6 twice from the original.   So no, don't use ""twice as short"" to say that something is half as long unless you want to make people uncomfortable or think you failed English class."
comics,3dbvq3,Cardboard_Mantis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:03:23 2015 UTC,"thanks. i would use ""half as long"" if i wanted to say i made something the size of (1/2)*its_original_size... if somehow that escaped my mind, i would use ""twice as short"" as a synonym.   i would use ""twice as shorter"" if someone else already made it ""shorter"", say from 12 panels to 10, and then i managed to reduce it to 8.  but since people use ""i made it 1x bigger"", ""i made it 2x bigger"" and ""i made it double the size"" as synonyms in my language, who knows :)"

The deliberate pacing takes away from the frivolousness of the joke and gives it real weight, standing in stark contrast to the common set-up in the first few panels.

comics,3dij8t,a-very-confused-goat,2,Thu Jul 16 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"I'm sort of on the same boat as you, but here's my take on this:  Get a website, start uploading stuff there now. Get a twitter account. Get a tumblr account. Once you have a few pages on the site, post a link on reddit, see how that works out. Do some fanart on your style of stuff that's going on right now (e.g. movies, comics, etc.), it will help you practice and maybe a big account will RT your stuff and give you a bit of exposure. Draw, draw, draw. Then maybe draw some more. Then show people; repeat.  Some indie publishers have a policy on submissions, it's not like you can just send whatever, whenever. Go to your favorite indie publisher, check out their website, maybe there are some guidelines on submissions. Also, if you have a few chapters on your website, or at least enough for someone to decide if they like your stuff, then start asking them directly on twitter. If someone decides to pay attention, then maybe they'll see your body of work and right of the bat they'll get a glimpse of your stuff.  It's all a combination of hard work and luck."

But the general demographic shift in the world these days is that people from northern european backgrounds, which includes most redheads and blondes are electing to have fewer kids.  And, as a recessive gene, you need both parents to have at least one copy of the gene, so the recessive gene won't get more scarce if redheads all start having kids with people with no redheaded ancestors, but it will express less frequently."

comics,3d8ve6,SchunderDownUnder,77,Tue Jul 14 18:41:21 2015 UTC,"You have no idea. He has a personality like a swift kick in the ass. He always has to be in control of the conversation. He does this thing where he will talk about something but be really vague about it so that you have to ask him about it to continue the conversation. He is cheap. My family isn't of any particular cultural background but, because my maternal grandfather brought the last name McBaine with him, he uses that as an excuse to wear a kilt. When my mother died, he showed up to the funeral long enough for his boss to see him and then left. I became the custodian of my mother's technical assets after her death and discovered that he had been emotionally torturing her for years via email. He was responsible for notifying his son from an earlier marriage about my mother's death and his solution was to send a single Facebook message and not follow-up to confirm he got the message. My nephew didn't find out until nearly a year had passed.  I could go on. . .he is a real fucking ankle biter of a person."

comics,3d8ve6,Gh0stw0lf,26,Tue Jul 14 20:01:10 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who wants more Gary stories? Because I do. I want more gary stories.
comics,3d8ve6,Ladderjack,12,Tue Jul 14 20:52:42 2015 UTC,"Okay, sure. . .this could be cathartic.   My earliest memory of him is at the age of four.  He was babysitting while mom was away for a couple hours and I was supposed to get a bath.  I remember sitting in a bathtub with probably two inches of cold water and the lights in the bathroom turned out.  I was still wearing a little T-shirt.  I remember being scared and mom being pissed when she found me. Until the age of six, I called him ""the angry brother"". I was riding in his car when I was eight and he was 18.  At a ""T"" intersection on a country road, I leaned forward to look at oncoming traffic, which of course blocked his view.  Rather than tell eight-year-old me that I was blocking the driver's view of oncoming traffic, he instead chose to slam his open palm into my chest, pinning me bank against the seat and bruising my chest.  I looked at him, stunned. . .and he was glaring back at me with fury in his eyes. In addition to the fertility treatments, he has received financial help from my parents over the years, which is family shit and no big deal.  (For those of you keeping score at home, that does mean he spent $30,000+ of someone else's money to have children he clearly couldn't afford to raise properly.)  However, he has quite vocally insisted throughout most of his life that myself and my other brother have been the recipient of more assistance of that type than he has and that it is proof that my parents held him in a lesser regard.  The fact of the matter of course couldn't be further from the truth (as my brother and myself know how to plan ahead and don't live our lives reactively). . .except for the lesser regard part.  My father will hopefully never see him again or I might have to deal with whatever happens with a 72-year-old man murders someone. His second marriage was to a hideous pig-faced shrew.  My nephew, a product of Gary's first marriage, was having issues with his step-father and so his mother sent him up from San Antonio to live with Gary.  She was not at all pleased with my nephew's appearance back in his life and did everything she could to push him out of the nest.  My nephew ended up at living at my parent's house at the age of 14.  In one incident, a Playboy magazine ended up at my parent's house somehow, in all its tasteful airbrushed glory.  With my nephew in the house, it quietly disappeared and then reappeared in another place several days later.  It was opined that my nephew had been curious and made himself familiar with the contents.  (At the age of 14, with marginal access, I would have been worried if the damned thing didn't disappear for a few days.)  The hateful shrew married to Gary, now pregnant, cited this as a clear indication that my nephew was depraved and couldn't be trusted around her babies.  This thereby cemented his removal from my brother's house and life, and he soon returned to San Antonio to live with his mother.  When I asked my brother about his abject rejection of his son from his life, he replied, ""I already have one broken family, I didn't want another.""  My nephew from that point on had felt rejected by his father and resented him. The hideous pig-faced shrew that my brother married was one in a long list of recipients for an email about decorative baskets or some such shit that middle-aged white women like.  She engaged in several ""reply all"" responses carrying a conversation with her sister, not realizing that she was broadcasting her insipid shit to everyone.  In that conversation, she said to her sister, ""things are gonna change for us because now I have the grand babies so I have the power"".  Shortly after that revelation, my parents were no longer allowed to see the grandchildren. Much like my family, my brother's wife's family has also largely rejected them and have cut off contact similarly. My nephew died last year from something highly preventable that will remain private.  My brother Gary, rather than travel to San Antonio, where his son had been for the past ten years, where all the people who know my nephew and remember him and care about him are, he elected to have a memorial service at his church here locally.  My nephew had not lived in this area for over ten years and the people he had known had been in their early teens. . .and had since been through their most formative years and probably had little attachment to my nephew.  So, my other brother and my father and I manned up, flew to San Antonio and attended the funeral service for my nephew so that at least someone from my brother Gary's family would be on hand to represent the father's side.  We met people who had known my nephew and could feel the warmth he brought to people and tried to share our memories of a younger man we had known to try to heal their sadness.  I'm glad I did that. . .but angry that my rotten brother couldn't be a man and do the right thing.   I tried for a long time to keep our family whole and keep him in our circle.  But he proved to me over the years that he didn't want that.  Admitting that was hard, in the end. . .but you can;t live someone else's life, even for the sake of people you love."

comics,3d7a3u,Zeppelanoid,365,Tue Jul 14 19:50:54 2015 UTC,"So I've probably spent way too much time thinking about what I would wish for if the situation somehow ever arose, and I could never really come up with something that I didn't think I would either regret later, or just would probably actually not make me happy in the long run. Plenty of cool stuff sure, Id like to fly or have a couple million in the bank, but nothing that stood out as ""yeah, that's what I want. No doubt about it."" But this made me realize that ""being hot"" really is the right answer, isn't it? like I don't think I'm all that ugly now, but wouldn't life just be better if you were provably hot? especially if you never had to worry about not being hot anymore.   I mean yeah, If we're talking Genie (djinn, however you want to spell it) wish, you have to worry about some stuff. Like you could end up like in the comic but not in a funny way, or you could only be seen as hot by other dudes (or chicks, depending on which you DON'T want) or some shit like that. But really thats the risk you take with all Genie wishes, and I think this one is really the best you can get in terms of payout (unless you take the ""I wish to be happy"" cop out).  TL;DR- Your first wish from a Genie should probably be ""I wish you  to not misinterpret or add ironic, surprising, or negative consequences to any of my wishes, including this one, but to give them exactly the effects I intend."""
comics,3d7a3u,wamsword,166,Tue Jul 14 03:58:18 2015 UTC,"Just a personal observation, but it seems to me that the the multiple wish granting genies are usually out to fuck you, or at least give you exactly what you wish for, even if that's not what you really meant, obviously. BUT the Genies that offer to ""reward"" you with a single wish usually give you the spirit of what you ask for if they can. Like here, until she fucks it up, he is passing on a easy chance  to set her on fire and going with making her a ""10"" the best interpretation of her wish. Still when someone, anyone, offers to make your dreams come true, choose your next words carefully. And, if you just didn't save their lives or release them from bondage, might want to call a solicitor."
comics,3d7a3u,DukeOfGeek,72,Tue Jul 14 04:38:32 2015 UTC,"I always thought I'd wish for the ability to heal anyone or fix anything, including myself.

comics,3d7a3u,dizneedave,58,Tue Jul 14 06:55:40 2015 UTC,"Not being able to turn off the ability is pretty classic double-edged sword wish material. Also, if you said ""no ability to harm or destroy"" to the genie, you'd be unable to break anything, meaning you'd constantly be starving but be regenerating those dying cells. Good luck in your own wished-for hell."
comics,3d7a3u,FeierInMeinHose,16,Tue Jul 14 08:46:42 2015 UTC,"This could go on forever, I guess.  No matter what I come up there's always a possible downside.  What if I implicitly said, ""with the ability to turn this ability on and off at will""?  There's a reason I said ""the well-meaning one wish genie"".  The genie wants to help me, not torture me for eternity.  As a thought, though.  If I couldn't help but heal everything, would I really be hungry or would my cells be perfectly healthy and well nourished at all times, not requiring any sort of nutritional intake to survive?  Would I even require food?  Like I said, forever."

I've watched enough superhero shows to know to keep that stuff under wraps as long as you possibly can.  You can't do it for the glory and you have to have a trusted group of people willing to protect you.  Even if people did find out, it seems...crazy, doesn't it?  Nobody would believe you."

comics,3d7a3u,TastyBrainMeats,4,Tue Jul 14 16:24:33 2015 UTC,"I think the safest an most useful choice would be money, especially if put on the spot with limited time to think. You'd be fine as long as you don't ask for so much money it would cripple to economy, like $10 trillion, and the authorities don't assume you stole it and arrest you. A nice $100 million maybe.  It's nice to dream about all those cool super powers. But, as Cracked articles are fond of mentioning, without supporting powers your wished for power wouldn't work very well. You want to turn invisible? Great, your retinas are now invisible and you're blind. You want super speed? Great, but you didn't ask for protection from acceleration or air resistance and you just caught fire. You want to fly? Great, but again with no protection from air resistance or acceleration you can't fly very fast; and without breathing apparatus and a warm jacket you can't fly very high.  Omnipotence? Remember to specify a keyword so every stray thought that pops into your head doesn't become real.  So I think that in the world we live in, money would be the most practical choice while still allowing you to lead an awesome life. Sorry to be boring."

If you have more than one wish, then the first is to prevent the genie from creating more restrictions than the ones he specifically mentioned, like Aladdin's genie.  The only wish you really need after that (or instead of if only one wish) is to have the powers of a genie without becoming one. If that isn't possible, then wish that you can wish to be a person whose attributes and life can be as detailed as you wish to make them. Can I be a rich, gorgeous genius living in the year 3000 with precise customization of appearance, life circumstances, abilities, etc?  Lastly, wish that the wishes must be exchangeable within 180 days if you're not completely satisfied.  PSA: If you have more than one wish, then make sure that the last one is to strip all genies of their powers, both present and future. If not possible, then wish that any future wishes cannot affect the manifestation of yours in any way. You don't want to cock this whole thing up."

comics,3d9fn0,deepdarkfears,28,Tue Jul 14 15:16:23 2015 UTC,That would actually be a rather humbling and profound beginning to an afterlife.
comics,3d9fn0,dirtyuncleron69,14,Tue Jul 14 18:17:32 2015 UTC,Yeah depending where you die it could be really pleasant.
comics,3d9fn0,Egon_The_Crab,2,Tue Jul 14 18:50:48 2015 UTC,I'm gonna run to the playboy mansion and die in a closet or something brb

comics,3d8xdd,Burekas,26,Tue Jul 14 12:41:44 2015 UTC,"It's the same thing that makes you wonder about whether you're going to jump when you're on top of the building.  It turns out (said a recent article in New Scientist) that this isn't because we have a death wish.  It's your mind instead reminding you that this small action would have grave consequences, that gently stepping off the building or pouring the drink over someone's head would result in a great deal of unpleasantness.  I have to say, this makes me feel a lot better about it - that it's a safety measure and not an urge to self-terminate!"
comics,3d8xdd,TomSwirly,45,Tue Jul 14 18:37:53 2015 UTC,I suspect most people have experienced the urge to randomly deck someone who didn't do anything to deserve it.  I wonder where that comes from and why we have that desire.
comics,3d8xdd,knylok,23,Tue Jul 14 14:55:31 2015 UTC,There probably some research on Intrusive Toughts

comics,3d8xdd,azoolie,0,Wed Jul 15 10:13:37 2015 UTC,"That was a surprisingly relatable comic.  I work at a small family owned company, and literally everyone there is Mexican. I like them all a lot, but sometimes I wonder what would happen if I called someone a beaner."

comics,3d8xdd,azoolie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:10:20 2015 UTC,"No, for those unaware, Mexican cuisine contains a lot of beans, and likewise, racists refer to Mexicans as beaners.  But again, I like my coworkers a lot. It's the best job I've ever had."

I also can neither confirm nor deny the correlation of this event to the presence of a similar beard on my face.  Just sayin'."
comics,3dcfqq,myketronic,5,Wed Jul 15 13:24:44 2015 UTC,This literally makes no sense to me at all. Someone with higher intellect please halp!
