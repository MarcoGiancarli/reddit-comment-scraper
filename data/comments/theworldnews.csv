theworldnews,3dctbu,magdaddy,4,Wed Jul 15 14:26:51 2015 UTC,"The solution to this is easy.  Allow member and subreddit filtering.  Hide subreddits you dislike, and filter any comments from those subscribed to them.  This way reddit doesn't lose anything diversity wise, while making the experience pretty and safe for those that get uptight over whatever they chose to be uptight about.  I personally want an age filter.  Under 22?  Filter.  This way what's seen is what one prefers to see, without sacrificing the diversity of the user base.  I am not racist, but I personally am interested in what communities like that are like.  A lot of what I take from reddit IS being able to witness fringe communities to get a better understanding of what their hot topics and arguments are, and disprove them.    If you want a win win win solution implement this easy change, and the whole community will benefit in more ways than trying to keep hate away, while simultaneously supporting that purpose.  Do it.  The majority love unfiltered, and this is a site to learn what other corporate entities shouldn't allow.  So the community moves on.    People want to express ideas and argue, and the moment you start to police the conversations, the Internet will find an alternative.  The users provide the content, and you provide a message board for discussion.  It will not be hard to reproduce, and when the community leaves, reddit dies, just like digg.  Setup filtering.  It's the only, and realistically best way, that will have more benefits than the problem you're trying to solve - and solve this problem as a side effect.  Cheers."

Like, the kinda thing where other people just shake their head and walk away or smile and nod their head? I know a 19 year old white girl who claims she belongs to ""La Cosa Nostra"" (The Mafia) and she swears that Jeff The Killer is real, because she's met him, of course. She also has a Blackbelt. A TRIPLE Blackbelt.  She's so used to telling dramatic lies for her entire life for whatever reason(attention, narcissism) and her parents and friends either didn't call her out on it, or they encouraged her. The rare person that does tell her she's full of shit? Her identity is rooted in her lies. Good luck.  THIS is exactly like that.  /end rant. Had enough of these people lately. Can you imagine having to deal with a 19 year old girl who claims to have met Jeff the Killer? She has no idea how to carry on a back-and-forth conversation. Bring up any topic and she'll ignore what you said and use it as an invitation to talk about herself.  ...end rant for real. I promise."
