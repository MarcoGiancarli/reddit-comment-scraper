notebooks,3dr4se,albynomonk,3,Sun Jul 19 01:48:52 2015 UTC,"So Tomoe Rive Paper is not thick; it is very, very thin. Because of this, you will be able to see some of what you write on one side on the opposite side as well (show-through or ghosting). That being said, it doesn't allow ink to bleed through at all, meaning that the opposite side is free of ink for you to write on.  Whether or not you WANT to write on the other side is really personal preference. I would check out the pictures of the Tomoe River Paper pad over at JetPens as they did a very nice job taking them (the videos are awesome to watch as well). I feel that the show through in their pictures is almost more obvious than you would normally get since they have lots of lighting behind the paper.  In my experience, I can see the ghosting at first. Colors pop so well on this paper that, once you write on the other side, the show-through is hardly noticeable. The notebook you posted looks really cool. It's hard to find large quantities of Tomoe River Paper for a decent price. I feel like I've heard of this site before, but can't remember where."
notebooks,3dr4se,glah,2,Sun Jul 19 14:37:49 2015 UTC,"Yes-ish. It's definitely thick enough to allow you to do so, but there will be some show-through. How much is dependent on the nib and ink that you're using. I don't have a sample at hand, but there's some pictures in this thread. You can also just go on Google Image Search for ""Tomoe river show through"" or something like that."
notebooks,3dr4se,Razithel,2,Sat Jul 18 17:42:45 2015 UTC,Yes post #19 illustrates the position well.  I was hugely nervous ordering my Hobonichi because of this.

I'd offer a photo for the OP but I think it is one of those things that is difficult to capture without good light and I'm not set up for that just now.

Customizable page layouts so you can have sections for pre-printed calendars, blank pages, and lots of other page types. Only 140 pages though... Rite in the Rain: Their ""fabrikoid"" books. The standard size has blank page options. The bonus here is that you wouldn't have to worry about all the important thing in your notebook getting ruined if it gets wet somehow. Moleskine: Gasp! /u/glah suggested Moleskins! But their ""chapters"" notebooks are sectioned which might suit you. Sketchy Notebook: Unique in that it had page templates you can use. The pages can tear it if you need, which might be nice if you want/need to remove some to scan.

This guide does, however, offer some nice suggestions on things that could complement your notebook. Organizing Your Notes. A ""Japanese hack"": foreign and a hack so it's double cool. This is a good method for labeling pages to find easily without using tabs. Essentially you create an index in the back (or front) with labels on separate lines. Then you color the edge of each page in the notebook on the same line as that label. This way you can quickly reference your index and see the pages corresponding to each label (e.g. ""code,"" ""class notes,"" ""crochet pattern,"" etc).     So that's all I've got right now. I'm on mobile so I may have missed something; I'll update later if that's the case. Good luck on your search!"

If you're looking for a good replacement, my two favorites are the Miro pocket utility notebook and the Hobonichi memo pad.  Those are my favorite notebooks at the moment. I'm leaning towards the Hobonichi memo pad right now; the Tomoe River Paper is just so nice, and EVERY. SINGLE. PAGE. is removeable which is basically one of the hardest things for me to find. And they're only about $5 for a 3-pack which is insane! The bummer is that shipping from Japan is kind of expensive so I'm just planning on ordering a bunch when I buy my next Hobonichi in September.  The Miro is super nice too, though. Lots of pages compared to most other pocket notebooks (68 vs 42) and the thing is super sturdy. Plain white or black, available with dot grid/graph/ruled/blank, and dirt cheap (~$1.50 each).

If travel is the purpose, then every ounce and square inch counts when you have a bag full of stuff to drag around.  I really like our 390-4F; it's our smallest hard-bound book.

It's a little disconcerting to have to re-orient the notebook to read consecutive pages.  That said, top-spiral books take up exactly half of the desk space of a side-bound book of similar size without the discomfort that you mentioned.  Our top-spiral books come in 3x4, 3x5, 4x6, 6x9, and 8.5x11.  The big books have a much firmer backing than the others, so I tend to prefer that one for note-taking.  The 6x9 version is right at your price point, though.  Our stuff is geared more for utility than luxury.  The paper is tough and water-resistant, but demands that you use pencil or ballpoint pen.  If you find that going class to class and moving around a lot is hard on your gear, then I'd definitely recommend our stuff.  Muji likely has some affordable stuff, Field Notes has a 'Steno Pad', Rhodia seems to make a lot of top-bound books, and there's one more 'luxury' pad that I'm thinking of whose name is eluding me (I think it has Tomoe River paper?)."

You could get a ScanSnap or Neat Scanner type which have trays for holding multiple pages; that way you don't have to manually feed the paper. Those can be expensive though ($200+).  I have a Brother mobile scanner that I bought a few years ago and has served me very well. If you do end up going the route of personal scanner, though, consider color and duplex options. Duplex scans both sides.  You could take pictures with something like ScanBot. The nice thing about this method is that it detects the edges of the paper (usually) fairly well so you get something that generally resembles a pics of paper rather than a paper on a desk or what have you. Obviously this method is quite time consuming.  You could, as you mentioned, send it to someone to scan for you. There are services that can keep the binding intact (expensive) or cut the binding (still expensive but less so).  You could convince a neighborhood kid that the scanning work is fun and have them do it for you.  That's all I've got. I looked into this heavily a while back because I hate having piles of paper and like to scan it whenever possible. The scanner I bought does pages one at a time, but once you get into the groove it actually goes pretty fast. I've really liked it. Good luck in your hunt!"

I feel that they restricted the use of the notebook with complicated form-based templates, instead of enriching the notebook with useful reference material.  Our military Field-Flex books, for example, are very often complimented for their field reference information.  Moving forward, for specialty books like these, I think we're going to make some changes.  While we're moving quickly away from specialized stuff, I can see us doing some short-run projects in the future for specialized audiences.

notebooks,3cocyr,glah,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:29:08 2015 UTC,I'd suggest splurging and spending the extra dollar or two to get one of the 3 ring binders that has a tab that you can press to open it up. The quality of the those are a lot better and will hold up through the semester. For paper it will depend on what you want to use. I have a friend who is majoring in Physics and Math and he uses blank paper for notes since a lot of his stuff needs modeled. Depending on how many classes you have you may want multiple smaller binders or one big binder. Either way I'd pick up a pack of dividers with your binder then separate out your classes and if you only have a few classes the pack of dividers can last you two or three semesters.

Our Dura-Rite stuff is aimed at more extreme applications like scuba diving, for instance.  It's a synthetic blend with a somewhat plasticky texture.  It's superior for long-term submersion, but has some tradeoffs.  The unfamiliar texture, expense, and pickiness with inks used are common complaints.  Yupo paper is good stuff, but I think it's highly specialized.  Our standard Rite in the Rain line uses a treated, wood-based paper that feels more familiar and is amply resistant to water for most applications."

notebooks,3c80zf,untilthegameiswon,3,Sun Jul 5 23:23:42 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't have access to the kind of commercial offset or letterpress printing that I would guess FN uses, but you could still get good results with a standard laser printer. The key feature to look for is the ability to feed the card stock through flat. Most printers wrap the paper around the toner cartridge during the printing process (thus the printed paper emerges on the same side as the blank paper entered). This doesn't work for thicker/card stock paper that can't bend as easily.   However, many printers have a setting for card stock, which feeds the paper through straight without bending it. You would need to read the manual for the particular printer model to find out exactly how it works, but I think it's fairly standard for most laser printers to include this capability.  Another option would be to take your file to a copy shop (i.e. Kinko's or Staples) and have them print it for you. Pricing is usually pretty reasonable, and most of the places I've used allow you to bring your own stock in to print on.  As far as setting up your file to print, a simple Word document would be sufficient. Use a text box the same size as the notebook cover, and make sure you print a test out on regular paper to double-check size and text placement before printing on your actual card stock.  I hope this helps."

notebooks,3c80zf,untilthegameiswon,2,Wed Jul 8 12:05:20 2015 UTC,"First, are you sure that your printers don't have that feature? It usually doesn't use the straight feed unless you choose ""card stock"" or ""heavyweight paper"" in the Paper Type setting of the print dialog box. Otherwise it will print normally by bending the paper.  If you do need to look at getting a new printer ... I asked a friend who does a lot of printing on card stock for her Etsy shop and she uses a Canon Pixma that she got from Walmart (I think) for less than $100. Just make sure when you go shopping that the printer you choose has a rear or straight feeder that doesn't bend the card stock in the printing process.   I hope this helps."
notebooks,3c80zf,rockydbull,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:00:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I check and there appears to be no way to direct feed it in. I have a brother j430w and a samsung ml2510 if that helps.

notebooks,3c80zf,knoxawe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:07:58 2015 UTC,You can likely run it through a regular printer depending on the thickness of the cardstock.  You can also silkscreen text onto paper really easily too.

If the template you chose has an image on the cover, but you don't want one, just delete it and move the text box up (or down).  There will be place markers set up for you to add your text to.  Now, if you want a page size your version of Publisher doesn't have as an option, you have a bit more work.  When you open the program and select New, that's where you will see both the template list, and also the selection of blank page sizes that are pre-formatted.  You should also see something called ""create new page size "" or ""custom page size"" depending on your version of the program.  Click on that, and fill in your numbers.  Voila!"

I was just looking at them the other day and they're nicer in person than they appear online, seriously. The 5.5x8.5 isn't really bulky, plus it has pockets and a pen holder built in. It's a bit wider so the pages sit in farther from the edge vs. the plastic cover. They look very professional. When I use up the calendar I have I will probably upgrade to the leather cover. If only I could find the purple in the junior size!  If you want to customize, I just had a cover made at Staples, 10mm lamination. It's nice and thick but still flexible. I'm working with a non-standard size, or I would have picked up the leather instead.   Check on Etsy for a ton of printable inserts. I think there are some covers too. Things marketed for the Circa will work.  I have that Circa punch and it works well for about 4 sheets at a time. The locking sliders are fragile so be careful with those. One of mine falls out a lot. I like print handouts and reference items so that they fit half a US letter sheet and then punch and insert.   I really love it as a work planner and notebook.

They have water resistant ""wipe-able"" covers front and back; are stitch bound and very fountain pen friendly (with sturdy, heavy paper).  I used these notebooks for years.  They are not thin notebooks as I think they have 96 sheets (so in the A4 size they will last you a while!). I used to have to really look for these but I think they may be available at EuropeanPaper.com now.   For something different I have recently switched to Quo Vadis ""Habana"" notebooks.  These have a cream colored paper which I really like, for a change of pace, and have semi-hard covers front and back somewhat similar to Moleskines (and the Webby notebooks made by Rhodia).  The paper is a little thinner/lighter but still very fountain pen friendly (the paper is very similar (I can't say exactly but they seem to be so) to Rhodia Premium ""R"" tablet paper which I also recommend and use at work every day now).  These are very high quality, stitched notebooks but are expensive if budget is an issue and these definitely come in ""blank"".  I get mine at EuropeanPaper.com.    I recommend videos on youtube by ""pelahale"" where he reviews and discusses fountain pen friendly notebooks in some depth.  Apica Premium (Japanese made) notebooks are one of his favorites; they lay flat, are stitched and have wonderful fountain pen friendly paper.  There are other notebooks that he (and I) like such as Nmemosyne notebooks (both of these are available from jetpens.com) but at one time, I believe, were only available only in spiral bound (I think that may not be true now).

Being able to copy and paste and type fast will enable you to pretty much get all the info without processing it but that means you will have to come back to that eventually to process. If you write the info down because you won't be able to put everything down you will have to think about what to write down this is the processing.

I'm always a little dumbfounded when I see pot smokers get all excited about the smell of it. Especially when they compare different strains. But then, I'm sure other people find it weird when I sniff a book or my tarot cards. To each their own, I guess.  I don't think I've ever tried hemp paper. I have a spiral notebook with sugar cane-based paper, but I think it's way too thin. Plus it's not white, which bothers me. I'm also looking at cotton paper, but I'm wondering how FP friendly that would be, since the fibers of the paper seem to be a big factor in terms of feathering and absorbency.   Then again, after looking into the main factors of paper, it seems like a delicate balance between being absorbent enough for faster dry times, but water resistant enough to prevent bleed-through. Then there's the opacity and show-through factors. Every paper I've seen seems to have some kind of issue with it, even the famous Tomoe River paper.   I'm also wondering if hemp paper is more expensive because of some kind of modification that paper mills have to make in order to include hemp in the manufacturing process. Maybe I should find a forum of paper manufacturers to talk to, if such a place exists."

Very strong, very opaque for the thickness. Seemed to age well. Utterly horrible with fountain pens, though; feathered terribly with anything I tried. Though I can't remember if I ever used an iron gall ink on it. Hm.  Anyway, there's no reason (other than cost, due to miniscule demand) that a FP-friendly hemp paper couldn't be made. The one recent production that I'm aware of emphatically wasn't, though."

notebooks,3bdar2,PenPocket,3,Sun Jun 28 03:43:30 2015 UTC,"Nanami paper has a few.   I just bought a LIFE Sunny but have only written on a single page so my observations are few.   It's expensive, but I like the leather-like cover and the colored page edges. I splurged.  The paper is heavy-ish, like Leuchtturm rather than ultra-thin like Tomoe River. It also has a bit more tooth but it takes fountain pen ink well and really is smooth - just not as smooth as the Tomoe River paper I've been using in the Nanami Seven Seas Writer. There is very little show through to the other side of the page.  The paper is lined. I thought I'd hate lines after dots but I don't mind at all. I wish it had 7 mm line spacing rather than 8 mm - seems overly big. The Apica Premium CD has 7 mm lines and almost went for that instead. I splurged on the Sunny.  Paper For Fountain Pens has a B5 Tomoe River notebook. I have the A4 version and it is very well made. However, it is blank so you must use a grid or line guide under the page if you want nice, even spacing. I wish Nanami would make a version of their Seven Seas notebook in B5."

I want to see how the binding holds up, even though it's nowhere near professional grade. But it actually lays flat, which I'm over the moon about.  It's roughly a B5 size, with 160 pages. I really like the size and feel of it. I made my own book cloth using heavier cotton for more durability, and paper is 80 lb text stock from French Paper.   It's not perfect, but it's a pretty good start for my first hardcover. I had a blast making it. I'm thinking of using heavier paper, and the lines need to be much lighter. I'm open to any other suggestions on how I can make the next prototype even better."
notebooks,3bakh2,CodeOfZero,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:35:08 2015 UTC,I love those endpapers! Did you design them yourself? And I assume it's linen-covered like a Baron Fig? Have you done an ink test? Also—this is my personal preference—if those lines didn't extend all the way to the edges I would seriously consider buying one. Are you going to do a Kickstarter like Code & Quill?
notebooks,3bakh2,CodeOfZero,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:37:06 2015 UTC,"The endpapers are one of my favorite parts! I did design them, and realized that I really like the process of creating patterns. I plan on doing different themes, possibly all book-related, for different models.  The cover is almost like a twill. It's a heavier cotton, which I think would be good for added protection. And I think I agree with you about the lines. In the two spirals that I made before this, the pages have a small margin, and I like it better that way. It helps keep my writing a bit neater. Also, the lines are supposed to be much lighter, so that they blend into the page once you start putting down ink or dark graphite. I wanted to do a combination of lines and grids (like Doane), but with college ruled lines, since I like writing small. I'm trying to come up with my own proprietary system for the page markings.  And though I have written in it, I haven't done an ink test per se. But the 80 lb paper does still have a bit of show through, so I thinking of bumping it up to 100 lb text stock.  Once I get the details right and make a working prototype, I do plan on doing a Kickstarter campaign. I started with Livreate, but I did some thinking and designing, and decided to ""rebrand"" my company as Cheshire Paper Co.

Some of the paper got screwed up when I got them cut to size, but I ended up using them to make pocket notebooks, with the extra endpapers as covers.   I was going to do a ribbon marker, but with this binding method, the ribbon could end up falling off, since the spine is so flexible and mobile.   I am looking into making the paper more FP-friendly as well. I've learned a lot just by reading through the posts and comments here. I haven't used a FP in a while, so I hadn't really thought about when I first started this process in May. But I quickly became aware of the need."

Bleeding with a felt tip pen? Fuhgeddabahtit. And once I got into fountain pens that restricted my choice of notebooks even further. My current journal is sorcery, I swear, because it was only about $10 at Target or Walgreens yet I get zero feathering and little to no ghosting or bleeding with fine and medium nib pens. It's even got 200 sheets! So while I still have time I'm scouring the globe for a suitable successor. Your Alice notebook looks very promising indeed, which says a lot!"

It's super quick to whip up custom pages either on the computer or with a photocopier, and any time the planner stops working for me, I can just switch up the page design. You can add sections for different classes, or for contact info, or just for note taking, and every month or so you can move out your old calendar pages and add a new month to the back, so you don't have to lug around old and irrelevant calendar info.

notebooks,3b2fgb,applejade,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:36:48 2015 UTC,Ah.  Yeah I have trouble finding one I like that's not really expensive!
notebooks,3b2fgb,lbsmith5,2,Thu Jun 25 17:40:12 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the prop department probably made that up. It's kinda what they do...  That being said, Paperchase used to make something fairly similar - soft faux-leather cover, thick, grid paper - around a decade ago. Or rather, they used to sell such a thing, branded by them. No idea who actually made it. I can't immediately find it on their website, but their website is kind of horrible..."
notebooks,3b2fgb,jsolares,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:23:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I thought that the prop department may have come up with it. But surely something similar exists.
