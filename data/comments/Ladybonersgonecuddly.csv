Ladybonersgonecuddly,3dmmhg,Julienb,2,Fri Jul 17 18:08:47 2015 UTC,"i know you're not hurting him, I understand cats. Just saying this photo is not a very ""ladybonergonecuddly"" photo. maybe post this in a different subreddit or something."
Ladybonersgonecuddly,3dmmhg,sunstorm77,3,Sat Jul 18 03:37:07 2015 UTC,"Picking up a full grown cat by the scruff is painful and potentially harmful in regard to the cats size. The cat "" chills"" out because you have put it in a position of pain that with movement causes more pain. Not to mention the cat is likely humiliated every time you do it. Maybe you should look up picking up adult cats by the scruff, you seem to have no idea what you're  doing / talking about."

I've had a few cats that I was a little rough with, but I also knew that THEY were a little rough and could handle it. You aren't doing anything to him here that's hurting him. Irritating him, perhaps, but not hurt - especially since it's obvious that his weight is on the box and you're just tugging his scruff a little bit."

I have seen some of your cuties in action, but have never observed a ferret for an extended period in person. Do they do that adorable surprised waking-up thing that dogs do when you silently place food near them? Pretty sure that seeing that would make my life complete."
Ladybonersgonecuddly,3dkbcn,PM_ME_YOUR_CHARM,2,Fri Jul 17 05:23:10 2015 UTC,I think yes. Jack if he's asleep and hears me move the food bowl or pick up the bag he'll get up and then try look for me. Not exactly the same but it's pretty close.  If I can find the tripod for the better camera that was used in this picture here I'll be able to get video of it for you. My normal camera isn't terribly good for low light.
Ladybonersgonecuddly,3dkbcn,PM_ME_YOUR_CHARM,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:07:12 2015 UTC,I imagine ferrets as being rather hard to sneak up on/surprise with food gifts in front of the face. Jack waking up and blearily scurrying about looking for you sounds heart-melting though.

Ladybonersgonecuddly,3bk6lm,PaulaJTK,21,Tue Jun 30 02:01:52 2015 UTC,My uncle has a 450 acre animal sanctuary in Indiana and the best shot of interacting with any of the animals are when they are youngins.  http://i.imgur.com/A5YRHLfh.jpg These are 3 grey wolf pups (13 weeks old) we got to play with in their cage for 30 minutes. They loved some belly rubs http://i.imgur.com/elR099c.jpg

Ladybonersgonecuddly,3aodv5,Emma__I,2,Mon Jun 22 14:29:33 2015 UTC,Would you say they are more messy/work than conventional pets? (asked by someone with 3 huge dogs and a ferret)
Ladybonersgonecuddly,3aodv5,CrossEyed-FishFace,4,Mon Jun 22 15:35:15 2015 UTC,"they are highly intelligent, require a lot of attention like a small child,  can be very messy/noisy, bites can be very dangerous if you end up with one that becomes frustrated in captivity (happens often), and there is a high possibility it will outlive you. i help run an avian rescue,  and i do not recommend them as pets.  if you choose to go that route anyway,  please have a plan as to where they will live once you pass. it is very difficult to place older parrots who can become depressed once they lose the one human they've become highly bonded to.   feel free to ask me any questions."
Ladybonersgonecuddly,3aodv5,Emma__I,2,Mon Jun 22 16:38:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   I read they could live for 80+ years and was considering getting an older one so that it probably wouldn't out live us. Also, I definitely don't have the skill to get a baby. It would be my first bird so I'm a total novice. Would you recommend starting with a lesser commitment bird? Is it even the same ballgame to have a parakeet?"
Ladybonersgonecuddly,3aodv5,CrossEyed-FishFace,2,Mon Jun 22 18:50:07 2015 UTC,"a bird really doesn't belong in a cage unless it is a free flight aviary. they are social creatures that are meant to be around other birds and to fly freely. that being said, if you truly feel that you need to have a parrot in your life,  look into rescuing one that is already displaced. purchasing from a store or a breeder essentially supports the disgusting way that parrots are captured and brought into the country.   may i ask what you are hoping to achieve by homing a parrot? do you intend to let it fly around your home or to cage it? are you planning to clip their wings to prevent them from flying away? are you willing to have more than one parrot so they may have companionship?"
Ladybonersgonecuddly,3aodv5,CrossEyed-FishFace,2,Tue Jun 23 00:52:01 2015 UTC,"I've always been an animal lover and a non-mom. So I will always need a sweet little someone fluffy to take care of... I currently have 3 dogs who are all getting pretty old. I wasn't planning on getting any new family until all our dogs have passed and ive grieved, but I know it's coming and I was just thinking about the future.   I'm pretty open. I always thought parrots were cool but I know I'm not qualified to have one without loads more research. It's more of a hypothetical at the moment. I would probably let it hang out in the house, but I get the impression that this is way more like having a kid than than I realize."
Ladybonersgonecuddly,3aodv5,Emma__I,3,Tue Jun 23 02:07:18 2015 UTC,"Think of it like having a toddler that never grows out of that stage and has a bolt cutter for a face. I love my Yian, but caring for a large parrot is not for the faint of heart. But if you have the dedication, I feel like they make far better companions than any other pet."
Ladybonersgonecuddly,3aodv5,CrossEyed-FishFace,2,Tue Jun 23 03:44:04 2015 UTC,"Bolt cutter faced toddler made me laugh.   Is yours destructive? Are there any remaining uncut bolts in your place? More importantly, could I train one to assist me in a jewelry heist or a prison break?"
Ladybonersgonecuddly,3aodv5,vetworker24,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:18:55 2015 UTC,"Lol, as long as you give them plenty of ""appropriate"" things to destroy, they'll leave the others alone. Yian is good about only chewing on her toys. But sometimes she does get a little overzealous. As for the burglary, you might want a pet that's a little quieter than a macaw. Personally I think it would be neat to teach her to open a beer bottle."
Ladybonersgonecuddly,3aodv5,vetworker24,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:55:57 2015 UTC,"as a fellow animal lover, i have a feeling you may be better off adopting another dog. while caring for a parrot can be a loving and enjoyable experience, it does face its unique set of challenges and possible issues. many parrots become very angry, noisy, and destructive once they've reached sexual maturity. in captivity, it is common for them to self-harm by plucking out all their feathers and sometimes even habitually chewing themselves to the point of blood and injury.  parrots are a wild, exotic species. as a whole, i do not believe exotics are meant to be kept as pets. however, there are plenty that disagree with me as exhibited by the large number of exotics in need of rescue once their caretakers: tire of them, improperly care for them, and/or pass away with no remaining family willing to take on such a large responsibility.   feel free to contact me privately if you have any questions in the future."
