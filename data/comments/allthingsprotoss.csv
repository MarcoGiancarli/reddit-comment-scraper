allthingsprotoss,3e5e0k,skanetiger,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:17:57 2015 UTC,"You just want to build your first pylon with any probe as long as soon as you hit 100 minerals, if you want to forge fast expand in pvz I would rally your 9th probe to the pylon spot. You should normally go 9 pylon 13 gate 15 gas with 2 chronos in order to provide the basic pvt 1 gate expand opener. Number of probes on gas varies greatly depending on what build you want to do. For example, making 2x gas at 15 and putting 3 probes in each immediately gives you enough gas to make a star gate straight after your cyber core finishes, thus this is the build everyone does in pvt if they want to make the fastest possible oracle, however you're committing a lot of probes to gas early on and thus won't have a lot of mineral income! I do the 2 gate safe expand in pvp (link on the sidebar) where you put 2 probes in each gas when you make them until you put down your 2nd gateway on 20 supply where you add an extra probe to each gas. It's difficult therefore to give general advice on the amount of probes you need in your gas, any good build will have the amount of probes in your gas worked out based on how much gas you will need!  Hope this was helpful, please ask anything else you're unsure about!"

allthingsprotoss,3e5e0k,KOUJIROFRAU,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:38:58 2015 UTC,"Here's a video of ToD explaining the optimal execution of a standard gate 1 gas core opener. This should answer most of your questions.  In general, you should think of it this way: the optimal time to build things is the instant you have the money to build it. Ideally, your probe should be sitting on the exact location where you intend to place a building. For example: in a standard build order that says ""13 gate"", this means your probe should build a gate exactly when you have 150 minerals, at the time when your supply count is coincidentally 13. If you're building it when you have, say, 160 minerals, your timing is slightly off. Or, if you command a probe to build a gate when you have 150 minerals, but it has to travel for 5 seconds before it actually builds the gate, your timing is also off.  This concept of precise timing based on money spending will guide every build order you want to learn. Check out ""Must see mechanics Day9 Daily's"" for far more thorough explanations of basic spending mechanics."
allthingsprotoss,3e4dib,BUFF4LO,3,Tue Jul 21 21:30:27 2015 UTC,"Carriers with adept/sentry support are pretty good.  I would open 4~6 phoenix then go straight into a third and carriers. Since zergs are skipping roaches, adpets are REALLY good defence against ling attacks. By the time a 4 base zerg attacks, you will have 4~6 carriers and enough adpet support to hold it off.  After their first big attack, it starts snowballing into protoss favor and if you want, harass with the unload interceptor thing. You will most likely have extra gas so put that into storms/archon."

LoTV economy gives you faster gases, which makes tech builds better. Besides, carriers got a built time buff in LoTV.

Zerg can crush a lot of them with mass queens + a spine in each mineral line and spamming lings.

allthingsprotoss,3e0pc7,RichSaila,3,Tue Jul 21 01:39:53 2015 UTC,"This is all the point of view from someone who has watched streams by pros or other Master/GM toss  Adept is well used for early harass, is damn tanky(5 stalkers shoot at 1 and didn't die in 2 volleys) She is inbetween in the usefulness. Tankier than Stalker but no anti air, more mobility than Zealot but attacks really slow.  Ability can be used for any of those, also baiting the enemy away from whatever you might want.  Skytoss is alive an well, even Tempest builds are a thing(thanks Rotti)  I have not seen any carriers personally but Ive heard good things  All-ins are still important, with lotv expansions are far more important and everytime you harass you're potentially all-in. Ive mostly seen PvP/PvT and the match up seems almost the same, harass, defend, harass and starve out the opponent from new expansions.  number 7 I cant answer as I haven't seen enough forcefield usage to say its worth while but I cant imagine they would make that less useful. I will say though, it's very map dependent on how much you use them.  Colossus is dead to me, Disruptor is okay but doesn't do enough damage to anything beyond tier 1 units. Storm is better."
allthingsprotoss,3e0pc7,WickedMakoto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:07:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the answer, first of all.  About the Adept: Is she used in any base compositions, then? Or do they still usually consist of Stalker/HT/maybe some Archons with Zealots as the buffer?  With Storm being the go-to AoE now, are there any safe expand buildorders to get there or is it all about harassment and pressure to buy time now?"
allthingsprotoss,3e0pc7,WickedMakoto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:26:36 2015 UTC,"Adept: She's used almost always as part of the opener, they act as a ranged buffer option.

Not that i know of, personally I've been just being really fluid and trying to adapt to the situation."
allthingsprotoss,3e0pc7,raghavr,3,Tue Jul 21 21:17:10 2015 UTC,1.Adpet- Harassment early game. Being ranged helps in taking out workers and kite slow lings  2. Her ability is to kite and helps her surivive a bit more to ge intel on the enemy base 3. used in pvt vs bio. Not seen it elsewhere 4. Not seen this unit at all in streams 5. Air openers work vs zerg i guess - and oracle vs terran for early harass.  6. Not seen too many 7. Seems to be all in late game crushed by bio ball or mass tier 1/2zerg units 8. Not seen ravager used at all wierd  I wish people played lotv more ;/
allthingsprotoss,3e05f8,SpiritSTR,3,Mon Jul 20 22:58:11 2015 UTC,"Alright, you did make one small mistake making the sentry before the MSC which let the lings do a bit more then they should have but that didn't really affect the game much. You had all the tools to stop him but you ended up screwing yourself by running back into your natural which let him have a concave at the expense of you for no reason (also allowed him to pick off all of those buildings from saftey). It is definitly a difficult build to deal with on that map because of the positioning of the natural and the 3rd but the main way you should go about dealing with it is cannoning up the natural ( 3 or 4 cannons) with a few sentries (around 2 or 3 is fine) and parking the MSC in an area where it can quickly overcharge the natural and timewarp in the center if necessary (somewhere around where ur cyber was). If he chooses to try to attack into the cannons you can simply FF it off with the natural sentries and then use ur main army to section off half of their army and kill it a 3rd or half at a time. Sorry for the wall of text i suck at formatting.  TL;DR cannon ur natural with a few sentries and use threaten with ur main army at the 3rd to try to section off anything you can if he tries to break the nat."

allthingsprotoss,3e01p9,OyHereWeGoAgain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:29:33 2015 UTC,"Well I'm going to say your main problem is the units you are choosing to produce. Zealots are all fine and dandy for the early game to deal with any ling floods u might have to deal with but they just don't scale into the mid game at all vs the tier 1.5/2 units of zerg like roaches (they do fine vs hydras but not when they have a roach wall as well).   The game on Dash and Terminal you actually should have won if you had time warped his army and then used ur zealots to kill his roaches/hydras instead of trying to save it all for the recall. You did have the energy to spare one timewarp and then still recall if stuff got too sticky. Another thing I've noticed is that you do not really ramp up ur production to match your eco. You do a good job of keeping ur economy up to a reasonable level compared to the opponents you played yet you did not use that advantage because you stayed on such a low gateway count. A good rule of thumb on that is 1base = 3/4 gates and 2base = 7 gates and 3base = 9-12 (depending on robo production). You probably noticed in those replays that you floated a considerable amount of money and imagine if that was turned into all stalkers or something.   Lastly one of your bigger problems is you are not utilizing sentries at all which you may not feel you need now but when you get to platinum and especially diamond level you will HAVE to have them in ur play. ~8 or so.   TL;DR change up your composition to have stalkers instead of zealots after the first 5 minutes, embrace the love of sentries, ramp up your production to match your economy.   Hope that helps __^"
allthingsprotoss,3e01p9,jamileon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:33:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I tend to get stuck on 4 until I notice a 1k float, then I usually make too many...

The immortal from the robo is unnecessary (most of the time immortals in general vs terran are unnecessary), instead just make stalkers and drop a robo bay as soon as you can and make 2-3 obs while the bay is building. He went mines and cloaked banshees that did a decent amount of dmg, and since you had a forge already you should have put a cannon at each mineral line. And you attacked into his natural that was a PF without colo range, so that fight was never winnable pretty much.  *Edit: if you have more stalkers instead of that immortal it's easier to target down the medivac and shuts down a lot of drop aggression."

allthingsprotoss,3dun51,tmluke12,4,Sun Jul 19 17:18:15 2015 UTC,PvZ is a nightmare. As protoss in the beta (the by-far worst race) you have to be very aggressive. Against zerg you have to constantly be on top of them with drops or at least some kind of aggresive scouting because you absolutely need to know if RHL is their army type or if they are going mutas. You have to be the reactive race now because the zerg deathball is unbeatable. I have done stargate openings with about 3-5 phoenix and then went for an 8 gate void ray attack once i reached about 3-4 voids. Against terran you haveto be very aggressive with drops and have to use disruptors in your main army. I find the best comp against bio is to play Disruptor-Adept-HT-Chargelot. 2 gate adept openings are a very effective build against terrans. Beating mech once they reach about 130 supply is near impossible unless you blindside them. The only way has been to slowly whittle their army down and economy down and contain them on 2-3 bases. You have to abuse their lack of mobility (even though they have cyclones T.T). Army comp against mech seems to be Immortal-Disruptor-Adept-Chargelot-Archon (i suggest 2 robos and using DTs for archons because you will be gas starved)  All in all prepare to have a hell of a time trying to win as protoss because it is a super weak race. I have played over 400 games on ladder as all 3 races and can honestly say that Protoss needs a complete rework. If you have any more questions feel free to message me
allthingsprotoss,3dun51,incens,2,Sun Jul 19 18:21:48 2015 UTC,I didn't think toss was as bad as it seemed for a while as I was winning on unranked for the early weeks of the beta. However now that people have figured out my shit and we are on these just god awful maps I think it's probably worse than ever. It feels like my time is best spent trying to figure out how to best hide that I'm just doing adept all ins instead of actually trying to win late game.

allthingsprotoss,3dun51,incens,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:24:47 2015 UTC,Naw dude the disruptor was super op and toss needed to be toned down because disruptors were just making hydra lurker not viable.   The next patch in a month and a half will reduce the tempests cooldown on their ability by 8 seconds and make recall on the mothership core cost 6 less mana. Then toss will be buffed enough to win everything. Also the color of stalkers will be slightly adjusted and another map without walls just 900 destructible rocks everywhere will be the standard.
allthingsprotoss,3dun51,avengaar,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:42:14 2015 UTC,I just started playing the Beta and I find the Disruptor really really strong... then a friend told me it was nerfed to dead in the last patch. I mean... he is not weak right now right? I mean... he just kills everything... how can that thing be even better? (it costs too much but it could not be more damage I think)
allthingsprotoss,3dun51,Saipen,2,Sun Jul 19 18:53:30 2015 UTC,It kills like 5 units max now. It's good in little skirmishes but when a wall of bio/lurkers/cyclones hits you and vaporizes half your army before your disruptors explode it's not that impactful for 300 gas.   It probably costs more than the 5 units combined and will have about as much impact for the rest of the fight.

allthingsprotoss,3dsl4t,LarrySellerz,6,Sun Jul 19 01:31:05 2015 UTC,"You want to be making them non stop up until 75. Even if you aren't on 3 bases yet you want to keep making them so that when you get your 3rd up, you transfer workers over and instantly have the saturation boost instead of needing to make a lot more after it finishes, thus meaning you don't see the boosted income for a few more minutes after.  An easy way to know that you have 75 workers is when you're on 3 bases with 3 on each gas and 18-19 on minerals on each base."
allthingsprotoss,3dsl4t,Gemini_19,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:17:55 2015 UTC,"16 on minerals is optimal, you get diminishing returns after that. People have written detailed analysis on this, if you are interested.   As for third base, there's no solid answer. Someone from a higher league can expand on this I'm sure, but generally, when you can afford it, and feel you can defend it.   You can also keep producing probes in anticipation of expanding, over saturating your nat. When the third completes, just transfer the excess probes to the third. I've played games where we skirmish for a bit and it delays me putting down the third, but I kept producing probes. By the time the third is done I almost have enough probes to saturate it already."
allthingsprotoss,3dsl4t,Endoroid99,2,Sun Jul 19 02:17:25 2015 UTC,"well you shoullllddddd resplit your rallies once you hit 16 on the nat. You'll get a lot more money that way since probes #17 and 18 on a mineral line are still like 90% efficient, compared to probe #24 which mines like shit."
allthingsprotoss,3dsl4t,willdrum4food27,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:46:19 2015 UTC,"In addition to what has been said so far:  Your build order should instruct you as to when to expand (or try to expand). If you aren't using a pro build order, I suggest doing so, since it will help a lot. Standard build orders frequently have small pauses in probe production when taking the natural, and provide you with the units and infrastructure to defend your expansion.  If for some reason you're not following a build order (like if you're trying to macro out of a failed all-in, or you're using a simple opening build that produces a reactive macro game), taking a 3rd varies per matchup, and scouting information. Generally in PvZ you can and should take faster 3rds against expand-heavy opponents, macro zergs aim to have at least one more base than protoss. PvT and PvP you're usually safe to take a 3rd around the same time your opponent starts their 3rd. There are lots of exceptions depending on what your opponent is going for; for example, it's fine to stay on 2 base against zergs that you notice are staying on 2 base for an extended time, since they're either doing some weird cheese (safe assumption that should prompt you to scout them more thoroughly), or for some reason crippling their own economy on purpose, in which case you're ahead.  tl;dr use a pro build that tells you when it's ok to expand, otherwise, you need to scout enough to decide if you are safe to ""make expand and then defense it"""
allthingsprotoss,3ds8d0,biggiesmalls_is_god,4,Sat Jul 18 23:24:31 2015 UTC,"Make a gateway/immortal army (immortals are super great against seige tanks) and then just don't let them expand. Park your army outside his base, use observers to track his movements, and then just expand all over the map and choke him out.  It's hard to break a turtling terran with seige tanks; few units benefit from the uphill vision advantage like they do. But it's easy to contain them, and once they run out of resources they'll have little choice but to try and take the fight to you (an inherently disadvantageous fight with seige tanks because it requires they unsiege), at which point you just kill them."

Even if the tempests survive, you're not going to have much left, its alot like fighting lings with void rays.    You want an army that can break thor hellbat tank (collossi, immortals, void rays, etc), and then you work your way into tempest.  The goal should be to have a composition that can a-move his until he gives up on the more mobile style and settles for turtle to slowly eke out a 3rd.  Then you grind him away with tempests as you no longer have the specter of the massive juggernaut a-moving over your stuff."

Seemed like you were good until the last fight but your 3 archons vs way more chargelots might have gotten you. Seemed like he had more fodder plus got another warp in of them during the fight before you replenished.
allthingsprotoss,3doq2y,Boredfast,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:14:25 2015 UTC,"I would've built more probes once I saw it's 3gate robo opening. Also your chronoboost actually hits 100% saved up very early, work on that. And build more probes, you could've had a lot more probes than him. You forgot to research +1 attack when your forge finished. Just in general you're very inconsistent and bad at building and chronoboosting probes, you get supply blocked and your build execution just isn't very good.  You aren't very good at scouting either. You put down a blind 3rd and meanwhile, your opponent went up to SEVEN gates vs your 4. If he a-moved his army crossmap at that point he would've just won the game right there. You got the better end though because he decided to not attack and go for a late third (completely randomly for no reason at all apparently). That's why you need to scout a lot. If he had went for a 3rd earlier than you, and started probing, you would've been WAYYY behind and just lose.  Finally you scout but end up with an incomplete scout in which you missed both the additional gates and his 3rd. Why don't you send more? You have 4 sentries with 6 available haluc but you refuse to send out more until a lot later.  You forget +3 for a while.  So your execution is just very sloppy, you're not building probes when you should, you forget to chronoboost them and sometimes forget to start producing them. This leave you with a very slow and weak economy. You would lose very fast vs someone that handles his build properly, this time your opponent wasn't very good at this so you were both in a similar position.  In the last engagement your army should've been positioned in a concave above the ramp. With better build execution you could've also had way more gates finished when he attacked in (just start addin' them when you're maxed and start banking money). Also, timewarps are crucial in PvP engagements. You ALWAYS want to get them down on his army if you can.  Your main is also a big weakness for you. You only have one cannon. Some players warp in like 5 dts and 5 zealots in main and suddenly you need to pull back your army there because cannons won't do and you have no detection. Then they attack your 3rd/4th/5th meanwhile. So you need to build better defense in your main and reinforce weak spots at 3rd/4th/5th etc in case of similar warpins."

Also mobility really isn't the big issue with protoss right now in LotV, the main issue is the other two races can reach their mid game power spikes faster then we can which lets them get overly ahead in the game if they abuse it right. I'm not sure how to fix that but I'm sure blizz is thinking of something. As for your second suggestion, I can't think of really any scenario where that would be a worthwhile addition to the game."

allthingsprotoss,3dlonv,Anthony356,0,Fri Jul 17 18:07:31 2015 UTC,"Actually immobility is the problem with protoss. It's why we need photon overcharge to take a third base, it's why it's so hard to defend dual drops, it's why it's so incredibly hard to defend more than 3 bases. Protoss's immobility and inability to effectively split into small armies (that arent total garbage unlike small marine marauder balls).

All of those range from moderately to extremely mobile and that is nearly half the units protoss can make. The warp-in mechanic allows our race to be very forgiving when caught out of position. So no, immobility is not the problem. You are right on our small armies being less effective then primarily terran small armies (not so much zerg) which kind of goes into what I was saying about the other races being able to reach their power spikes faster then protoss."
allthingsprotoss,3dlonv,Anthony356,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:21:13 2015 UTC,"Say you're playing on terraform and you're sitting in a very standard position with your army, in that nook between the natural and the third. If a terran player boosts in and drops 6-8 marauders in the main base, there is no way you get there, even with blink stalkers, before those marauders kill your nexus.   Also i wouldn't exactly consider adepts or colossi fast. Both have an average or below average movespeed and have movement mechanics but that doesn't necessarily mean you can get them to a place any faster if those mechanics don't come into play (for example, walking from my natural to my main, oh wow my colossus saved about a quarter of a second walking up a cliff instead of the ramp right next to it. Or if the adepts would have gotten there before the 10 second timer anyway).  Gateway units being generally garbage in small numbers and warpins being more vulnerable means that warpin mechanic won't save you in those circumstances nearly as often anymore.   Ask players, they'll tell you the same thing i am. If you get caught across the map and a terran drops your base you have 2 options, recall or baserace. Your units aren't fast enough to get back before the terran ransacks everything. It was like this a lot in WoL, don't know if you played it, which led to stale games because protoss players were so scared to move out because of the threat of drops. mobility has been and still is a major problem of protoss."
allthingsprotoss,3dlonv,jamileon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:31:00 2015 UTC,"Aight so when I said ranging from moderate to extreme mobility I mean that some of the units I listed have moderate mobility. Adepts are very mobile when they need to traverse long distances and Collosi are fairly mobile themselves when defending multiple bases at times. disregarding the fact that those blink stalkers should be in ur base instead of with your army like every protoss ever, yes they might have difficulty getting to the nexus in time to defend it if they are in ur army. but if you honestly believe that warping in ~7 zealots won't buy you the time for those blink stalkers to get there to kill the drop you are being a bit silly.  Collosi come in handy a lot for defending multiple locations on maps like Coda when you are defending from ur 4th to your main by using that cliff. Are they optimal? lol no. But just cause they dont have 4.25 movespeed does not mean they have no mobility and can't defend multiple spots. Am I saying that collosi have the same mobility as speedvacs or mutas? nope, im saying that protoss is a fuckton more mobile then mech terran or broodlord infestor or any of the actually immobile units in the game. As for the changes legacy made to warp-ins all it really changed is that you can not hold a middle finger to the other races and warp in zealots up their asses, you have to warp them in further away and then send them. Ya it's less effective but it gets the job done 9/10 times on equal footing.  Oh and I did play WoL where I was high masters, and I have a solid 80 or so games of legacy so I think I don't have to ask other players to double check if I'm right or wrong since I'm not theorycrafting"
allthingsprotoss,3dlonv,gregjazz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:50:19 2015 UTC,"Isn't army immobility something that all races encounter late game, though? I always leave a little supply for harassing late game for zealot/DT warp-ins, or blink stalker hit squad. Little things like that to harass your opponent's economy or production go a long way."

allthingsprotoss,3dlonv,incens,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:48:36 2015 UTC,tldr?
allthingsprotoss,3dlonv,Anthony356,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:06:16 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem that protoss currently faces is late game viability. It is almost impossible to take a third against a Terran or zerg who isn't completely retarded. Also past 10 minutes our units are just absolutely horrible in fights. The adept and disruptor are nice, but i think they need to do units like the colossus justice because right now there is no reason to build a colossus at all. And i think they need to re work the warpins because we need it for defense and in its current state it is pretty bad. I don't think a MSC change is away to go and this suggestion sounds like it could be a little broken but hey we probably need some broken stuff to help protoss rn.   TL;DR Im sad because protoss is buns past 10 minutes into the game in LOTV"
allthingsprotoss,3dlonv,incens,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:03:09 2015 UTC,"Protoss isnt that bad mid-lategame, i promise. Go tempests in PvZ, as in like 4:30 fleet beacon (i prefer 13 pylon 14 gate 16 gas 17 gas (2 on each) 18 forge cyber (3 on each when cyber finishes) +1 immediately when forge finishes, adept, msc, nexus, stargate, oracle.)  You use tempests to zone and disintegrate any lurkers, broodlords, ultras, overseers, queens, whatever that you see. Stasis mines are set up behind/near your army as a backbone to fall back on if he gets aggressive. You move out with your first tempest and it's essentially a parade deathpush until the end of the game. You macro up behind it of course, but you can't afford to lose map control against lurkers. Here are a few replays (keep in mind I'm diamond, i don't play perfectly):   http://lotv.spawningtool.com/901  http://lotv.spawningtool.com/900  Against terran i go 1gate expand adept drops into fast twilight for adept shield. Then i max(ish) on gateway + immortal and a few mixed in disruptors. Bio trades semi poorly with gateway immortal, especially if there are good disruptor hits."
allthingsprotoss,3dlonv,Anthony356,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:22:35 2015 UTC,"The thing is once a zerg sees tempests you are screwed because corruptors rekt the crap out of them. Also Tempests are a HUGE investment and if you make them to deal with lurkers the zerg will just destroy you with RHL. . PvZ is near impossible in its current state, having played both Protoss and Zerg. PvT Midgame isn't horrible, you're right, but right now a protoss army CANNOT compete with a mech army that a terran can deathball with and there is nothing that can be done to counteract the deathball. The current protoss simply cannot fight the terran lategame whether it be Bio or Mech. Protoss lacks mobility against bio and strength against mech."
allthingsprotoss,3dlonv,Seldentar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:57:45 2015 UTC,"Stop playing like it's HotS, it's not. In PvZ if they invest in corruptors that's less gas for lurkers or ravagers and because you're only making 3-5 tempests in your army, the corruptors are useless against everything else.   In PvT bio can be dealt with lategame with pure gateway immortal. You can add in higher tier units,  but if they don't tech up you don't have to either. Adepts are really good. I havent played against mech so much though so i don't have a lot of comments on it."
allthingsprotoss,3dlonv,incens,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:59:53 2015 UTC,That isn't true. I've been watching Nightend's stream (he's top 5 GM in LOTV) and he always manages to take his 3rd against some of the best Terrans and Zergs that are playing LOTV (oGsTop/Vibe/etc.)   From my experience playing LOTV taking a 3rd is easy but getting past 3 or 4 bases without dying or taking too much damage is really hard.  If you're having trouble just taking a 3rd you're doing something very wrong.
allthingsprotoss,3dlonv,aiurlives,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:51:54 2015 UTC,You can take a third but defending it is near impossible. That's the issue im running into. You can't even argue by far that toss is incredibly weak in LOTV. Just because a GM player can make it happen doesn't mean a diamond scrub like me can ;). Also most of the player base on this game is not GM (duh) and therefore this example doesn't really speak too much about the games balance. I have played over 400 Games of LOTV so im not just a whiner. I have played all three races

allthingsprotoss,3dik25,Barrykinz,2,Thu Jul 16 19:51:50 2015 UTC,You won that game. optimal would be a replay were you losed.
allthingsprotoss,3dik25,Barrykinz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:32:32 2015 UTC,Right on. Here is my latest loss. http://ggtracker.com/matches/6061767  Haven't played in the past two weeks as I'm waiting on my new keyboard to come in. Had to send the old one back due to faulty switch.
allthingsprotoss,3dik25,Barrykinz,2,Thu Jul 16 20:35:05 2015 UTC,"Okay so first of all I want to mention some things which are really important especially for lower league players.    1st “Try to improve your macro mechanics!”  If you look on your replay at ggtracker you should already have noticed that you had a spending quotient of 62  which means that you spend your money like a gold player. You should always try to get this value to around 80  (Grandmaster). It does not matter in which league you are. This value just tells how well your macro mechanics  are.    2nd “Get a solid build order!”  When I looked your replay you played a quite inefficient build. I would bet that you do not copied it from a good  player. So feel free to go on “imbabuilds.com” or comparable sites and search for a good and solid opening.    3rd “Never move out before maxed! (Lower Leagues)”  This is a quite old Protoss rule but it is still one of the best rule in lower leagues and the fact that you disregarded  this rule was one of the main reasons why you lost this game. The rule is: “Do not move out before you are  200/200 Supply”. This is a quite good rule because players in lower leagues can not deal with a Protoss deathbal l. What you did was attacking with lots of Zealots, Immortals and Storm after a very inefficient opening which  results in you having less units than your opponent had.     4th “Take your third Base rather early than too late!”  Taking your third is not that big of a deal. It costs you 400 Minerals and give you a lot of an economic advantage  over your opponent if he will take it much later than you. If you is able to attack you and you have to cancel it you  may lose 100 Minerals but this risk is absolutely worth it. If you get better you will learn how to scout and decide if  you can already take a third or not but just try it out. Whenever you have money over (which you should have a lot  because macro is not that good in lower leagues normally) just place your third.    So after this quick tips I will come to the actual analysis:    Your game started with you placing a 9 supply Pylon which is completely right. But after it finished you do not  Chronoboosted your Nexus which is a huge mistake! When and how to constantly Chronoboost is one of the most  important things a Protoss needs to learn! Below Masters league it is enough if you just always spend your  Chronoboost and never have any energy on your Nexii left. So Chornoboost your economy as long as you do not  have 66 Probes (full saturated bases) and after that just Chronoboost your Upgrades/Tech.    A quite “little” thing but also important is your Mothershipcore. You delayed it quite much. In my opinion there is  never a reason for skipping your Mothershipcore unless you are a Pro-Gamer and want to hit an important timing.    So the next “big” thing I noticed was you getting a Robo + Forge right after your Cybercore and way before your  first expansion. This is a huge mistake in my opinion because Robo/Forge are buildings you want to play macro  games and if you stay too long on 1 Base you will fall behind but I will not cover that anymore now because I  already said something of you should go search a solid opening build order! =)    Your first expansion finished around 9 minutes and at this point I noticed a lot of mistakes. First of all your Forge is  inactive which is really really really bad because you want that upgrades especially if you get your Forge as early as  you did. I mean you got your Forge on 1 Base and then you are forget to research the next upgrade? Makes not  that much sense at all. So try to remember while playing that upgrades make a HUGE difference in fights. Your  Robo was inactive too which should also never be. You have 400 Gas at this point were you could have made  observers. Just anything. Tech units are much more important than Gateway units!    At the 10 minute mark you started your Twilight Council and followed it up with a Templars Archive for later  storm. But just at the 12 minute mark where your Templars Archive finished you took your gasses 3&4 which is  extremely late. But that leads back to your bad build.    You double expanded now at 15 minutes which I think is a kinda good move because you have like 2000 overmins  but even than its way too late.    Now your 130/200 supply army waddles across the map and you attack into tanks which is your next big mistake.  You should never engage in tanks if you are not absolutely sure that you will win the game through this. Instead  you could use the fact that your terran opponent is building defensive units and expand even more or you could try  to make a warpprism with dt’s to be annoying in his main base which will cause him to send some of his bio (or on  your level his complete army) to his main which allows you to attack into the tanks because most of his army is not  there.    Well just to say that. You could have won that fight with proper micro but micro is not the thing you need in lower  leagues. You need to understand when to expand, when to make which unit and how to macro. So next time just  tech up to colossus and attack him when you are 200/200 supply.    So basically you lost because of your bad macro and your even worse build. (Almost every game below diamond is  lost because of bad macro) So try to improve in that. GGtracker will help you with that. Upload all your played  matches to ggtracker.com and look your spending-skill. Focus in games on spending your money and executing  your build and you will see success in very short time.    To give you some timings that you can follow for expanding:  Try to place your first expansion at 4 minutes.  Try to place your third base at latest 10 minutes.  Now make one more Nexus every 4 minutes and defense it. ;)    I hope I was able to help! =)  By the way, this was my first written replay analysis so pls be gracious."

allthingsprotoss,3dii87,somerandomtoss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:02:32 2015 UTC,why would you block escape path with buildings?
allthingsprotoss,3dii87,DarkTurtle7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:32:37 2015 UTC,This would be from opening with a reaper wall. I've found that some terrans will do a 3 or 4 mine drop and will smartly start where you have an opening and drop towards the wall. So if you have just a little delay in reaction a lot of probes won't get out in time. Obviously mini map awareness is key but that's easier said than done.
allthingsprotoss,3dii87,somerandomtoss,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:03:03 2015 UTC,"It might be me but I don't get reaper walls at all. In your experience, how often does it stops terran from scouting your tech?"

allthingsprotoss,3dii87,willdrum4food27,9,Fri Jul 17 16:29:30 2015 UTC,"I have a couple ways I like to catchup in the matchup, pends on when I fall behind and how.   slow 3rd and double ups. just playing super defensively and try to get a upgrade advantage hoping he plays aggressively and allows you to take good fights.   Go fucking kill him. If I open blink--> robo, and lose a lot or workers to mine/hellions. I just can sometimes cross the map and go for the kill.   fast as fuck 3rd. This is what I usually attempt if I lose my workers in a trade (ie kill the shit that killed the workers) but don't think I can counter attack. Can work. super scary. (can hide the 3rd if you want I guess).   DTs. self explanatory. Usually only do this if I fall behind later into the game.   super fast storm. Skipping colossi or stopping colossi production, and/or skimping on upgrades to get faster storm and praying they overcommit to Vikings or I get a lucky storm.   if the drops do no damage and you kill the drops you are quite far ahead. this lead will either represent itself in a faster safe 3rd and/or an upgrade advantage. remember these drops delay stim by quite some time. If the medivacs don't die, they will keep dropping and have a chance to make up for their opener at any time and faster 3rd wont be as easy."

The only thing you can do is play the best you can.   As for Terran being behind if they don't do damage with their harrass, well let's look at the facts: if the Terran is going mmm then he will need barracks , factory,  star port, which are the same things he needs for wm drops so he's not going in a different tech path to get there, hes making the stuff he would make anyway. It's not like opening robo and going for dt harrass where you have to go a completely different tech path just for dts which are useless except for the harass. So Terran is not really behind unless they lose their drops completely."

allthingsprotoss,3dii87,Kami1996,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:46:53 2015 UTC,"My advice, as a Terran would be to tell you what I lose to even after putting a Protoss behind. What I generally die to varies into two counts so I'll break it down that way.   A) I die to an all in. This is a great move especially if you've managed to kill units. So, if you can slam straight into any ""lots of unit kill"" you can win. The last time I did a great mine drop, my opponent went straight into blink, marched across and wrecked me. He was masters, so I'm assuming that was a solid move.  B) The next thing that works great is solid response that pins your opponent back so you can catch up. What I normally face here is either dts especially dts from a warp prism. This really pins a terran down because dts are demons and they can help equalize that number of kills.   Hope that helps."

allthingsprotoss,3djx9o,Saipen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:38:15 2015 UTC,"Right. Tho your first max in PvP will almost always have a decent amount of zealots in the composition.   Later on in the game, when you/your opponent can get +10 archons zealots aren't very good except for warpins.  One common thing that a lot of players do, is they'll stop making units at around 175~ supply, then they'll fly a warp prism to their enemies base and warpin 10 zealots + 4 DTs into the enemies main. Not only can you do damage with this attack, but it also can pull their army out of position so that you can snipe their third/fourth."

Zealots should be warped in mid-fight and used to flank the opponents collossi, which really screws with their targeting and does alot of damage since the zealot arent lining up vs archons or such."

allthingsprotoss,3dhmq4,Morbidius,2,Thu Jul 16 10:06:09 2015 UTC,I've been using warp prisms for a 10ish gate all in against Terran with some success. I get a warp prism early to keep units alive against cyclones then transition into adding a twilight for adept armor and a ton of gates. It should hit around the time the terran is trying to take a third with a good bank for a full round of units warping into the terran main. It seems to be the best way to force an engagement where the terran can't kite me across the map with cyclones. I don't think the strategy is that great but it's one of the few things I think somewhat works against cyclones.
allthingsprotoss,3dhmq4,avengaar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:07:59 2015 UTC,Double immortal 8 gate mass zealot which was popularized by naniwa in hots may be an option. Then you have adepts aswell and roach/ling or even hydra should get rekt by this.
allthingsprotoss,3dhmq4,Saipen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:18:29 2015 UTC,Id say it auto loses vs lurker/hydra and you have to invest into scouting and being safe vs zerg more so than you did before in LOTV so I don't think it's that viable.
allthingsprotoss,3dhh64,AmssoBador_Spacelot,7,Thu Jul 16 08:44:43 2015 UTC,"Go gateway expand with gateway near your nexsus, and scout after that."
allthingsprotoss,3dhh64,somerandomtoss,5,Thu Jul 16 08:57:49 2015 UTC,open 13 gate scout with probe 14 gas 16pylon 18 core  21 nexus 21msc this is just a normal gate expand build order it is bad vs a 14/14 speedling all in but you can still hold if you play well this video should help dealing with early ling aggression https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxrYbXWNEo4 a very good thing is to start a zealot once you have the minerals at 19 supply and cancel it if you don´t see an early pool and build the natural. on 4 player maps it can be hard and very random. against a random player you can´t play ffe. another thing you can do is to open with 2 gases and put 2 workers in each so you have a good start in pvp and if it pvt or pvz you can just pull them out of gas and continue with your normal build order for the matchup
allthingsprotoss,3dhh64,jumanjii_sc2,2,Thu Jul 16 09:01:35 2015 UTC,"I open every matchup the same - pylon next to my nexus, 9 scout and 13 gateway. If I scout cheese I put a forge down and wall in a cannon, if not I get cyber and expand along with mothership&warpgate and place a pylon to start walling at my natural with a forge / gateways.   The next part I don't know if its advisable or not as most players go for a halluc scout, but I get a zelot out to scout asap."
allthingsprotoss,3dgahc,Oldnewprotoss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:14:00 2015 UTC,I've found that this build works great on this map as long as you keep your scouting probe alive (for proxy pylons).   also with the build you need to factor in the extra sentries you need in order to stay safe due the crazy vulnerable natural.
allthingsprotoss,3dgahc,soverylonely,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:23:10 2015 UTC,You can't FFE on that map but I understand the concept anyway. I get ling bane all ined more on this map than map ever. There are so many openings to your natural.
allthingsprotoss,3dgahc,avengaar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:33:40 2015 UTC,Against zerg just take an early 3rd ans tech to +2 blink... I mean as soon as your third is up and you have your simcity the zerg can only try to attack at 2 locations... I think this map is really good for protoss against zerg. Especially in macro game.
allthingsprotoss,3dgahc,Saipen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:57:34 2015 UTC,"why are you having issues not allining? If you actually go into detail with what you are having issues with it might be easier to help.  The map is solid if you gate-cyber expand pvz as the free 3rd makes up for the slightly inefficient opening (and if you get an ovie kill with faster stalker its nice). The only thing I find myself doing if the game goes long is killing part of my walloff in the nat to allow faster access to the rocked off attack path. PvT terran cant reaper expand because 10 gate mamacore rush is a free win vs it, and stargate openings into some phenoix are super strong on the map because it covers the airspace and the 3rd is easy."
allthingsprotoss,3dgahc,willdrum4food27,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:09:04 2015 UTC,Well one thing that always destroys me is a run by through the the third after I take my expansion. I find it hard to all the entrances to my natural and I usually lose around that time if I go for a macro game.
allthingsprotoss,3dgahc,willdrum4food27,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:25:57 2015 UTC,doesnt take any more buildings the on like coda really. Takes 2 buildings and 2 pylons to wall off nat completely. The only difference with that is that a single cannon cant cover both walloffs which makes FFE and nexus first kinda shity but doesnt really make a difference for gate-->cyber-->nexus. You can have your army in 1 spot that covered both the 3rd and the nat (with a guy in the walloff) which makes it easier to hold said third then like on coda where they can put their army between the 3rd and nat.

allthingsprotoss,3dfl3v,Immadawalrus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:56:26 2015 UTC,"Protoss really isnt a reacionary race, it's a build order oriented race. Usually your best bet is having a build order in mind because when you sit back and play reactionary higher level zergs will just take more and more expansions which puts you more and more behind. Sure you can try to take 2 nexi in the beginning to help combat this, but usually Zergs will tend to play greedier because it benefits them more offensively to be greedy then it does other races."

allthingsprotoss,3ddrag,Jemmie13,4,Wed Jul 15 14:00:34 2015 UTC,Practice using force fields. I know its difficult especially at first but good force fields make zerg players very sad pandas.  Honestly even okay force fields to choke out lets say half of their banelings will change games immensely.
allthingsprotoss,3ddrag,quigglesworth,2,Wed Jul 15 14:11:52 2015 UTC,"hrm. ok so if we just gonna ignore the obvious answer of making more stuff lets go through the rest. The most straight forward answer to banelings is Forcefields and aoe. forcefield stop the banelings from hitting shit and colossi or storm erase them very quickly before they can hit shit.   Simple enough there.   the next answer is looking at cost efficiency. banelings are really only cost efficient vs super clumped up units, specially clumped up zealots and sentires. Not so much vs everything else protoss has. So if you army is pure stalkers and you just fan out a little, despite all the banelings hitting your shit, it will be more cost efficient for you then him and it gets even worse if the banelings are hitting super tanky shit like archons or immortals.   Kiting you have to be careful with. Since if you over kite or over run away, you are actually just doing no damage during the fight and the payoff to apm required isn't thaaat high if the banes have speed (apm is a limited resource, special at low levels, if your kiting saves 2 stalkers while you forget to warp in 10 more its not worth), specially compared to just making a concave before the fight."
allthingsprotoss,3ddrag,willdrum4food27,2,Wed Jul 15 14:17:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks guys.. I do struggle to just ""make more stuff"" vs zergs a lot of times..They apply constant pressure for the whole game it seems. So I am having to replace units a lot and the army isn't growing nearly as fast as my other match ups.   So My tech to the tanky units is always slower vs Zerg.  My other match ups I can usually say ""ok I messed up macro here, or I shouldn't have taken a fight here.""  vs Zerg I just feel like I am closing my eyes, making units and its a toss up to see what happens."
allthingsprotoss,3ddrag,willdrum4food27,3,Wed Jul 15 14:40:57 2015 UTC,"zerg is always the hardest matchup for new players. Mainly because its hard for newer players to know when zerg is greedily droning or making nothing but units. My general advice in this matchup for new players is to have a timing. Not necessarily allin, but have a timing where you attack the zerg with X. Without this just constantly playing defensively vs zerg will just result in things like a bunch of muta randomly showing up or zerg being on 80 drones and 5 base when you on just putting your 3rd down etc etc. This isn't a problem in higher leagues when your macro is more crisp and you have good scouting and game sense, but yeah try attacking :)."
allthingsprotoss,3ddrag,Saipen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:00:44 2015 UTC,Banelings are really inefficient units against protoss because all units are so extremely tanky compared to zerglings and marines. Try to get archons or colossus out. As soon as you have these banelings will not do anything to you. I assumed you lose macro games against banelings right? You do not lose against baneling busts? Btw. Learn to force field is always a good advice. As long as you do not have tier 3 units you will need them to survive. Maybe its a also good advise for you to stay defensive if you see banelings until you have tech units such as colossus or archons. Gl hf young protoss brother!

Its important to not care about your rank or you will get mind blocked every time you have a losing streak.
allthingsprotoss,3dau1z,CHAZTATS,11,Tue Jul 14 21:01:45 2015 UTC,"There are a couple things you can do.     Open with a 2-gate expand and push with 4 adepts.  You can do some brutal damage if they don't react well, and usually zerg will overcommit lings to deflect.   Open blink to deny any ravager play.  If you suspect cheesy 1-base ravager play, open robo instead and get an immortal out to shut it down.   Some zerg don't really have a grasp yet of ravagers, in which case VRs can really do damage still.   You need to get an early stalker out to deny drops in your base.  An early adept can do wonders against early ling harass.    With lurkers, you absolutely cannot allow zerg to simply stroll up to your doorstep and camp.  If you see lurkers coming, you need to force zerg into burrowing.  Disrupters are huge help here, especially if Zerg decides to clump up his lurkers (you don't even need detection then).  Alternatively, you can kill his hydras with disrupters and allow voidrays to clean up the lurkers.  DO NOT decide you can simply a-move into an army that is backed by lurkers.  You will find out very quickly that it's a terrible idea.    Drop play will be very helpful, especially disrupters or even adept drops.  Dropping 4 adepts into a base can do decent damage."

Then you expand when you have enough after the 4 Adepts. You can also stop at 2 Adepts and expand at 27 but I feel like you need 4 to do enough damage vs a good zerg."

I of the opinion that an oracle for initial harass, stasis mines and then revelation (VERY IMPORTANT VS LURKER/INFESTOR/VIPER) are crucial to the match up and so I've been going adept voidray and foregoing disruptors all together.

allthingsprotoss,3dau1z,jgwink2,3,Wed Jul 15 05:43:28 2015 UTC,I've never been so salty as I was last night playing ranked ladder in LotV. I had 350 games in LotV unranked ladder but the combination of the new maps (which are crazy hard for toss) and the extreme amount of varing builds zerg can do makes playing any sort of macro game near impossible. I understand having the zerg favored maps in HotS because toss is considerably better but putting them in LotV is just making toss nearly unplayable.  I've gotten mass ling bane bust/dropped like 5 out of 20ish games against zerg.  What the heck is the answer? I can't deny him just ferrying speedlings into my main and attacking my front or my fucking 90 backdoor rocks that every new map has. I honestly played like 80% of my games on Dash and Terminal LE which I now have vetoed because of how ungodly hard to hold anything it is. I'm pretty sure that map is the worst map to ever make it into HotS.  The response to lurkers is just so vastly different that the response to everything else that playing macro games without have mass carriers is pretty much impossible. Sentrys are just fucking useless against zerg if they get out lurkers. I keep nearly killing zergs (20-30 worker leads) then I just get torn apart by lurker pushes trying to play adept immortal sentry stalker.   I think I need to take a break from LotV because it's just making me angry. The all ins I'm loseing to are just straight up bad.
allthingsprotoss,3dau1z,avengaar,5,Wed Jul 15 12:39:02 2015 UTC,"its the beta. I want the beta to be full of the worst possible maps for protoss so that the game will be balanced around those maps, and not have to deal with that shit later when they stop patching as often."
allthingsprotoss,3dau1z,willdrum4food27,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:43:21 2015 UTC,Lol you raise a good point. I feel like somewhere someone at blizzard is looking at the ladder and is like uh 12% of people are playing protoss and their win rate vs Zerg on Dash is 24%.... We should probably nerf the protoss deathball more so they have to expand in order to balance them.
allthingsprotoss,3dau1z,avengaar,2,Wed Jul 15 15:17:30 2015 UTC,"1) Open forge, get +1 ground and +1 air early. Can proxy a cannon to mess with their natural if map allows for it.   2) Do 4-gate pressure + prism zealot bombs to slow down hydra ball and buy time, get 3rd and stargates behind it.   3) Get carriers (they poop on hydra with upgrades)  4) Tech to HT to combat inevitable vipers.   Storm-carrier-chargelot is unkillable for zerg atm. Problem is getting there, but these little prism drops can help a lot. You need 4 gates and +1 to make it effective. Bonus points if you add sentries and do ramp blocks.   Edit: I have to warn that this build kind of dies to ling-muta, but nobody plays that atm in LoTV."
allthingsprotoss,3dau1z,Ozy-dead,2,Wed Jul 15 11:57:34 2015 UTC,I saw PiliPili playing LOTV last night and at the time I tuned out he was 33-0. The few games I saw vs Zerg he did an Adept push and expanded behind. It seemed to be working very well so I'd give that a shot.
allthingsprotoss,3dau1z,pilosh,2,Wed Jul 15 14:18:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, PvZ is completely winnable as long as you play your cards right. I always open 1gate double gas forge into fast oracle. You get +1, cannons, and a nexus fast enough to defend safely from drops and other bullshit, while also having map control with stasis mines. Then you transition tempests, and later carriers. Once your first tempest comes out you can take a 3rd and just play aggressive on the map for pretty much the rest of the game. You zone with tempests while having 1-3 stasis wards as a backbone near your pylon, then you just pick away at stuff, kite with tempests, disintegrate what you can, and eventually you'll kill enough that you can push into him and just end it.  Here's a few replay links (keep in mind i'm diamond, these games aren't perfect): http://lotv.spawningtool.com/901/  http://lotv.spawningtool.com/900/  You can also look up any videos by FalconPaladin PvZ LotV's with Walnut playing, those are much older with less refined builds but the overall theme is generally the same."

allthingsprotoss,3dau1z,southernstorm,2,Wed Jul 15 05:32:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think the comp is an issue, zerg's end game comp is great and can fight anything toss puts out. The issue is getting there. Against colossi comps viper tie the gap super well since both blindling cloud and abduct are great vs them. But with stalker sentry immortal storm comps that constantly push and recall its harder to get that late comp to stabilize since while vipers are still fantastic they aren't nearly as good as vs colossi comps. That's why zerg tempo play has been very popular since if you can keep protoss at home you have an easier time getting the comp you want.   One would think the answer would be infestors instead of vipers (or both) and some zergs are starting to do that, but infestors are much less safe in the fights then vipers are and with the fungal projectile it is dodge-able although it makes the sentries forfeit. Infestors might be the answer as is and zergs just need to practice with them more, or they would be a good thing to buff to make zerg not have to rely on pressure to make it through the midgame (but really is that a bad thing since its what terran does in both matchups as well). and hell it could be the complete opposite and zerg might go the way of the terran all together and the answer might just be additional refinement in zerg tempo play, as we see zergs beating great protosses with this type of style.

I haven't wanted to play toss since everyone's saying it's in such a weak spot, so I've been playing zerg, and I <3 lurkers. There was one game where the guy was doing the gateway-only units comp, which I guess is a real thing, but it kept getting shredded by lurkers. OP or not, at some point you should stop throwing your army away for basically nothing.  Does toss have a way yet of countering lurkers? Do HotS Colossi out range LotV Lurkers? Do we maybe need the range back just to deal with Lurkers?"
allthingsprotoss,3d7qxv,avengaar,2,Tue Jul 14 12:59:25 2015 UTC,"Nope. HotS colossus are the same range as lurker, and lurker deals bonus damage vs Colossus, so it's definitely not the way. Also, you usually need stuff in front of the colossus... Anyway I was always in favor of the colossus nerf because the unit is boring. It needs a redesign and re-purpose right now.  Yeah, I agree with you. Adepts do round out gateway comps but it just can't deal with it. You need range (tempest), or double disruptor on top of a lurker (which is really not viable, since you waste two disruptor charges to kill one lurker, every 30 or so seconds. It's awful)."

Last season I played on 2 accounts: one, my diamond account, which I burned my bonus pool on and not much more; the other, a messing-around account which I played a whole lot, but frequently left league and threw games on to keep the mmr low (silver-gold range). I also ended the season with 0 bonus pool on the higher ranked account, and ~100 bonus pool on the second account. The diamond account was given access to LotV beta, the other was not.  Best course of action seems to be to play your best and keep your bonus pool low. I don't think there's anything else under your control which could increase your chances."

""little"" misstakes are huge mistakes if they happen that early in the game becaue upgrades are supposed to finish at the right moment when you need them (same with units) and if the opponent is aggresive you have nothing to defend. tbh i would have left if i lose natural nexus. this should not happen if you are on 2 bases. hope this helpes. just execute the build better scout more for drops with obs or playons around your base and split army to defend more bases once he starts droping ( this is the hardest part)"

Don't know the exact timings of course so would have to check :). And yeah of course you CAN win if he scouts what you are doing, but that's on him.

allthingsprotoss,3d3nlw,LarrySellerz,4,Mon Jul 13 06:58:29 2015 UTC,Nexus first doesn't really work in PvP and pvt because you can't really hold early pressure. In pvt you don't have anything to stop the reaper and in PvP you can't stop the MSC stalker poke.
allthingsprotoss,3d3nlw,nax0rz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:21:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you don't know this or if you're just trying to keep things simple so that the OP can understand it. But I thought this was worth mentioning, just keep in mind this is NOT advisable in lower leagues (or even on the ladder for the most part). Anyway, I'll just say it... you can actually get a zealot out and not lose any probes to a reaper in PvT if you defend well. And it's not nearly as hard as it sounds imo.   What you have to do is cut probes at your natural, have a good simcity, then let your zealot tank the damage as you micro it back and forth against the reaper. Once it gets too low on hp, you send it to the back of your mineral line and your other units should be pretty much out at this point. Your simcity here has to be a little specific. It's a little different and map depent. You want to wall the back of your mineral line on each side rather than a single side fully or almost fully.  Of course, you still have a little less gas than when you open msc expand and your early nexus won't give you any edge other than an extra chrono boost or something. But yeah, you can make do with nexus first on certain maps even if your oppoent opens reaper.   Once again, I do NOT recommend opening nexus first in lower leagues. But I think it's a nice build to have up your sleeve against certain players in custom games, since a lot of players are very predictable.   I've even done this in PvP against very predictable, passive players who like to cut scouting. It's surprisingly effective if you know who  you're playing. But yeah, this is obviously an extreme approach to metagaming, like sOs going proxy 2 gate twice in a row against herO in the IEM finals. And believe it or not, players like Naniwa and Rain have lost to nexus first in PvP. Naniwa lost because he refused to scout as usual, and Rain would always open with an expand build at the time and the map was whirlwind so... yeah. They metagamed him pretty hard on that one in proleague. A very interesting choice of strategy."

I don't have that much trouble with reapers, I usually send out 3-4 workers to chase it around while a zealot spawns, and just keep making probes. I can usually hold off even very heavy reaper harass because I can lose workers and still come out ahead.   PvP is really my main problem. So are cannons a viable alternative to gateway units for early defense? I havn't really been able to get them to work :(. I normally only make zealots, should I make stalkers instead? They get kited for days without charge. I like making zealots so I can save gas for archons  Another question I have is how do I know roughly how many zealots I need at certain times, in order to hold off common timings? Sometimes I get greedy with tech and get burned, where if I just spammed zealots for a while I could have held off the attack.   Ive gone nexus first every game so far and it's working out OK so I don't want to switch until I can't win anymore. I just made gold today! been playing about a month"
allthingsprotoss,3d3nlw,Gemini_19,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:08:12 2015 UTC,I usually send out 3-4 workers to chase it around while a zealot spawns   This isn't good LOL. How are you not losing all of those probes? You never want to be chasing a reaper around with a bunch of probes since that alone probably makes the economic boost the Nexus first gives you obsolete.
allthingsprotoss,3d3nlw,Gemini_19,2,Mon Jul 13 17:07:09 2015 UTC,Really? I feel like its better than just letting it hit my probes. I think it works because they mess up their macro when microing reaper in low leagues. I've watched replays where I lose like 10 probes to a long reaper harass and I still have more than them once it ends.
allthingsprotoss,3d3nlw,Gemini_19,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"That's hilarious. But once you get better and play vs better people they will be able to micro and macro at the same time. And lose 10 probes to a reaper is disgusting. That should be literally game ending.  The economic benefit you get from a nexus first over a 1 gate FE is so negligible when you add in the how much more difficult it is to defend reapers.  1 gate FE gives you all the eco you could need with a perfect defense vs reapers as well.  However the thing you're supposed to do if you don't have a stalker or MSCore out to deal with the reaper, you micro back the probes that are getting targeted and then try and surround the reaper quickly with other probes if they try to be greedy and go for the kill. However it's usually hard to get the full surround so the split second you realize it won't happen you need to send them back. Having probes aimlessly chasing a reaper around does nothing but destroy your economy and should be losing you the game."

My micro vs reapers is meh, but it's not the worst, and i rarely lose more than 1 or 2 probes. I have my highest win rate vs. terran at 64%, so I'm not struggling too badly with them.   Vs. protoss, is there really no way for me to hold a 1base stalker timing with nexus first? Do cannons work? Also, should I be walling off vs zerg? ling runbys are annoying"
allthingsprotoss,3d3nlw,avengaar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:33:22 2015 UTC,Nexus first straight dies to literally every aggressive opening in PvP. It won't work out.  And yes absolutely you should be walling vs zerg.
allthingsprotoss,3d11zr,pikebot,7,Sun Jul 12 17:10:46 2015 UTC,"One thing you have going for you is that you're lower level, and that's not meant to be an offensive. What's it's supposed to mean is you have a lot more options open to you for what to do.   A lower level protoss who's turtling and massing carriers MAY not get detection, whether it be with an obs, oracle, or with cannons. If they don't have detection, DTs will rekt their worker lines. In case they DO remember to get detection...  Blink stalkers are a way to go, as you obviously found out. Were you microing the stalkers at all? You don't have to be PartinG with your blink micro, but even saving a handful by blink back could increase their effectiveness exponentially.   Finally, I think Stargate would be the best answer. Just make sure to keep up on your air upgrades if you go this route. You can mass phoenix (with basically a 1:1 ratio for stargates to bases you have, I think). If you do this don't forget about the range upgrade the phoenix have. A) You'll be able to engage from further away if you rush in, getting at least one entire extra volley off before the fight starts, and B) it'll be easier to kite the carriers. Or you could just go mass voidray, which I think it's one the strongest Protoss compositions in the matchup (just takes for fucking ever to get there). I'm pretty sure I've been able to semi-consistently and on time make 3 voidrays off of 3 bases. The final option is Tempest, which I think still do bonus damage to Massive air units (and I'm assuming Carriers are Massive). If not then they are still great kiting units. Tempest are slow, but so are Carriers. You can just let one volley off, move back, let a volley off, move back, over and over, until you've witted them down.   Also something important to remember is you don't want to a-move against carriers. Your units will prioritize attacking the things that are attacking them, which are technically the interceptors. Unless you have a lot of DPS in your army (like mass marine does), it'll probably do you more good to focus down the carriers themselves. Also speaking of interceptors...  Storm those fuckers. Storm is not very useful in PvP since most Protoss units have a lot of health. But you know what doesn't have a lot of health? Interceptors. And every time you kill one of them they have to be remade at 25 minerals a pop. Might sound cheap, but you can't replenish those things all day long, especially if you're denying him mining expansions. You might have to storm your own units too, since that's where all the interceptors will be flying around, but you'll probably kill them before the storms kill your own units. And once their interceptors are dead the carriers can't deal damage anymore. So all long as their all dead, all of your units could be left with 1 HP and their is nothing the carriers can do to them anymore."
allthingsprotoss,3d11zr,dundent,3,Sun Jul 12 17:43:44 2015 UTC,"I actually did make a wave of Templar with that in mind, but then I realized I'd forgotten to get Storm, and I needed to move on his third right the damn now to keep him from getting anything out of it, so I immediately merged them into archons.   I was basically blinking my stalkers under them and then focus-firing them. It seemed better than trying to blink-micro them away given how long carriers' attack range is.  Yeah star gate play would probably have been good. Only reason I didn't go for it is that I don't Stargate much, so I wasnt super confident in my understanding of the match ups there.  Thanks for your detailed response!"
allthingsprotoss,3d11zr,Dezib,2,Sun Jul 12 23:17:29 2015 UTC,"storm is definitely the right way to go.  also, voids>>>>phoenixes vs carriers, since phoenixes do 5x2 damage to them and carriers have huge armor. also carrier dps is too high for phoenixes.  if you're going to go stalkers, you should really blink under them to have more units fighting.  another thing: if he is going carriers, he will be floating minerals, so he'll be massing charge zealots and maybe a few archons to go along. pure stalkers are not gonna cut it there. so you'll want a few zealots, maybe a few colossi or archons, storm, voidrays and the rest of your money in stalkers i guess. amove the zealot archon, shift-click focusfire the voidrays and stalkers and storm between your and his air units and on his carriers.  a few other things: just go kill him if he makes carriers. either he will be going them off of 1 stargate, which means there aren't enough to make that much of a difference, or he will have 2 stargates, meaning he is constantly having 700/500 in his production que, not fighting. so attack early.  also, guardian shield is amazing vs interceptors, since they have many attacks with even more missiles on low damage. a carrier has 8 interceptors with 2 shots per attack each and an atk cooldown of 3 seconds, so you reduce the damage of each volley by 32 with guardian shield and by 16 per armor/shield upgrade.  third: get detection, mothership tech is the same as carrier tech."
allthingsprotoss,3d11zr,Saipen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:47:24 2015 UTC,I agree in storm. High templars and archons are thr reason why air play does not work in pvp at all. Even mass voidray is countered by it. Phoenix get feedbacked. If he gets tempests it will get a little bit tricky but then blink stalkers would be the right choice.
allthingsprotoss,3d11zr,two100meterman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:15:57 2015 UTC,"I'm only Silver with Toss, but I think that was the right response. Carriers are so expensive, and if he's on 2 base he only has 4 gases available, I think you were in more of a position to throw away units if you're up a base and using lower tech units.  If he got a critical mass of Carriers it would be bad, but w/out a 3rd that is hard I think. If he did somehow secure a 3rd, then maybe you would ned blink stalker/archon? Not sure tho."
allthingsprotoss,3d11zr,_ROG_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:12:48 2015 UTC,"He should really be dead before he gets enough carriers to be effective. Most player's option when the enemy goes carriers is the ""just go kill him - hes going carriers"" option. Normally it doesn't matter what you have really. Carriers are so damn slow that if you went for pure zelots you could probably win just by killing all his workers. Im just a bit concerned that you are focusing on unit counters rather than macro and preventing the oracles from doing crippling damage. It was probably only because he had done such damage that made it seem like carriers are a viable build vs stalkers."
allthingsprotoss,3d11zr,_ROG_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:08:35 2015 UTC,"Well, that's pretty much what I did - I backed off to get blink and my third up, and then I pumped huge numbers of stalkers at him until he died. I'm quite aware that at my level having more stuff beats having the stuff that counters his stuff almost every time. And I don't think carriers are a viable build at all, the moment I saw them was a moment of pure joy as a game I thought I was going to lose horribly turned into a game I most definitely could win. I only made this post out of curiosity - you see carriers so rarely that I genuinely wasn't sure which units do well against them.   (Losing so many probes to the oracle harass was definitely my bad; this is one of my first times playing PVP since HotS was released, so I was focused on protecting my expansion from any aggression rather than watching out for oracles. I'll know better next time)"

I didn't want to be that pretentious guy who says ""Macro more"" to every question lol but I noticed others hadn't stressed it as much as normal. Just thought I'd check you knew."
allthingsprotoss,3d11zr,_ROG_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:08:54 2015 UTC,"Carriers take too long to come out. Way too long. You should be able to either do significant damage to him or get both an economic lead and counter his army composition.   In fact, I think you can probably do both. My guess is that taking an extra base and doing a chargelot archon push is probably doable. And you can probably start getting tempests behind your push if need be. Needless to say, you don't wait until he has too much stuff to do this push. I can't say for sure this would work either because mass carriers is so uncommon, but yeah you should be able to straight up kill your opponent if you scout and understand in what situation you are and what your timing window is.  Nobody should be allowed to tech to carriers in PvP willy nilly, unless they're turtling really hard to the point attacking is just stupid. In that case, you'll probably be better off outmacroing him - take more expansions and counter his unit comp.  If you do end up taking the macro route for some reason, you have tempests, which not only come out faster but are also a hard counter to carriers. There's pretty much no point in going carriers in PvP, tempests are just straight up better. They come out faster, cost less supply, have superior range, have a lot of hp as well, counter pretty much all stargate units and colossi (it's fairly important to get storm against mass voidrays though), can be used to focus down archons... they may not have as much overall dps as carriers, but if all you want massive dps against ground units then you need colossi.  EDIT: Actually, I think they've nerfed tempests recently, haven't they? I haven't played after season 1, so I don't know what's up. Either way, if you play your cards right, carriers shouldn't really be a problem."

allthingsprotoss,3d05sb,Golle,3,Sun Jul 12 11:53:17 2015 UTC,"You can just not at first. Terran army is high dps low health. So scvs up front significantly increase the life of the units.  Toss army is low dps High health plus some high power units. So pulling probes is a fractional increase in the buffer units hp, while scvs like double the health of the bio.   The reason why toss pull probes latter is because the only reason to pull probes is to keep power units a live or if the dps of the terran army drops low enough for it to help. So once all the force fields are gone and all the zealots are dead probes can actually keep the fragile units more safe."
allthingsprotoss,3d05sb,willdrum4food27,3,Sun Jul 12 12:21:08 2015 UTC,"The reason why toss pull probes latter is because the only reason to pull probes is to keep power units a live or if the dps of the terran army drops low enough for it to help.   Also the longer the fight goes on the more skewed the terran army becomes towards a marauder-heavy composition, and marauders are (obviously) much worse against probes than marines are."
allthingsprotoss,3d05sb,SidusKnight,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:40:03 2015 UTC,that's a great point.
allthingsprotoss,3d05sb,Dezib,3,Mon Jul 13 06:51:56 2015 UTC,"SCVs have 5 more hp than probes, can repair each other,  be healed by medivacs, don't get in the way of terran units since they are all ranged, and terran has a second worker the mule.  Probes just melt and get in the way of zealots. So not a great idea to pull them  unless you have no other choice."
allthingsprotoss,3d05sb,blinkSCV,0,Sun Jul 12 22:23:43 2015 UTC,"Main reason: Because Terran has Mules, and most of their good things are mineral heavy. They can partially compensate for losing most of their mineral workers by dropping Mules.  Speculation: Also I figure Terran tends to have more CCs then Protoss has Nexi, so they can reproduce worker lines quicker.  Further speculation: You don't pull probes for the main fight for the same reason Zealot/Archon is dead: Widow Mines. Take the choke to the natural (or anywhere outside of the naturals) on Cactus Valley. You could take all of your probes and line them perfectly from wall to wall of one of those chokes, and I'm guessing 3 to 4 (maybe 5) widow mines could take out the entire line in one go. Now there's something to be said about absorbing the first volley with workers so your main attacking units don't take the hit, but it's still not great. If you don't pull probes and lose the main engagement, you have a chance to still win the game if you can defend the counter attack. If you do pull probes and still lose the engagement, you now have no probes, so even if you do get your army out of their there is now no hope of winning the game."

Yeah, 12 marines could shred 20 probes, and 20 SCVs could overwhelm 5 stalkers, but how does that disprove what I said? And where are those numbers even coming from? Hell, 12 stimmed marines could shred 5 stalkers too.  And I never even said they were just as effective. At most I said Terran has better fallback economy after losing all their workers. Want to make another comparison? Take a unit tester, play protoss, and kill all of your probes at the 12 minute mark. Now play terran and kill all of your SCVs at the 12 minute mark. See a difference? Terran has Mules, and can continue to get mineral income if they lose a bunch of workers.  Great (belated as hell) contribution to the discussion, m8."
allthingsprotoss,3d05sb,dundent,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:07:33 2015 UTC,"You are wrong because the game is over as the result of the push one way or the other 95% of the time. Who gives a shit about econ. Scv pulls are because scvs greatly increase the army strength of terrans vs no storm. Not really much else to it.  Terran has mules, toss can remake workers faster and both really don't matter here"
allthingsprotoss,3d05sb,willdrum4food27,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:00:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand the strength of an SCV pull, but the econ is important if the terran push is stopped. If the push works then terran wins, big whoop. If the push is held with minimal losses, it IS the toss' game to lose at that point. But if the terran has any breathing room for things like harassment then they might still be able to crawl their way back into the game, regardless of how slim those chances are. Maybe they get off some lucky widow mine shots, whether it be on worker lines or on the main army.  If the terran push also killed a bunch of probes and both sides are on equal worker amounts (or close enough to it), then terran has the advantage because of the mules. Yeah, toss can chrono out workers, but still.   Okay, maybe the econ isn't the MAIN reason for why terran pulls the boys, but it is a strength nonetheless."
allthingsprotoss,3d05sb,dundent,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:54:45 2015 UTC,its an after thought at best and not a big one. And yeah if workers are even toss is behind in econ scv pull aside. So mules is what allows them to pull 5 more workers with the same econ as if they didn't have them. meh

allthingsprotoss,3cx5e5,AndDuffy,2,Sat Jul 11 15:41:35 2015 UTC,but I kinda don't know how to break the habit of F2.   Disable it and force yourself to use actual hotkeys. It's the only way and I highly HIGHLY suggest you start doing that immediately.  SC2 doesn't really benefit from using extra buttons like in other games. Everything you need to press is right there for you. The only thing I have set to my 2 mouse buttons are one of the camera locations for my ramp/wall off and also the idle probe selection.
allthingsprotoss,3cx5e5,Gemini_19,2,Sat Jul 11 16:11:26 2015 UTC,"As Gemini said, I unbound the select-all army key.  F2 is a camera hotkey for me.    I personally would avoid using too many buttons on your mouse.  It's too easy to misclick a button on the mouse and do something you don't want to do.  I have a Steelseries mouse with side buttons and I don't use them.  I had to unbind the buttons entirely because two of them would zoom the camera in and out and I'd accidentally hit those buttons.    The thing about the F2 button, as a Protoss, is that it can cause some big issues.  Now that you've moved into Platinum league, you're going to notice things such as better Terran drops, etc.  If you start using F2, you're going to pull your observers out of position.  Moreover, if you've placed stalkers in your main to prevent drops, or if you have a zealot in your wall to avoid ling runbys, you're going to grab those units and pull them out of position.  Get into the habit of assigning units to groups the moment you warp them in or the moment they pop from a building.  This will help you avoid the F2 key."

allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,aiurlives,5,Fri Jul 10 21:39:22 2015 UTC,"That's basically what you're dealing with here. Knowing what tech to get to counter your opponent's tech is important, but sometimes you just can't get the scout in time and you have to throw something down without having any information. And knowing what to do after that point is vitally important.  Robo vs Twilight: Pretty cut and dry. There are two possible things you want to do with a Twilight: go blink or go DTs. Robo counters both of these, at the same time if you opened Robo. Immortals will shrek Stalkers, with or without blink (will require micro + zealots if they have Blink). And observers will provide vision of DTs so that the rest of your units can shrek them. Best part is you could go sneaky LotV Lurker mode on them and hold your fire until you can guarantee the DT kill. Because unless the DT player has a really good eye, he won't know you have an observer until his DT is already being attacked. This will require some map awareness and slight micro, but can be done. If you opened with Robo you can make an obs first (with or without chrono) and then start immortal production. And it should be noted that you want to go into colossus production basically asap, because one of the biggest factors in determining who wins a PvP fight is who has more Colossus. Think of it like Roach vs Roach. If you have 10 more roaches, there is very little the other guy can do to win the fight, if micro'd properly.  Twilight vs Stargate: Less cut and dry. Two things will consistently be coming out of that Stargate: phoenix or oracles. Oracle can provide detection for DT, which is super important to keep in mind, and Phoenix can wreck your shit if they go unchecked. The accepted non-stargate counter to a stargate opener is Blink. So you need a stalker ball. There's always a chance they could start making voidrays, which you NEED to know about. Keep up on your scouting. You don't have overlords you can sac anymore, but you have a good second best (if not better): hallucinations. Sentries are not free units, but energy is. And the longer the game goes on the less important forcefields are going to become. So as the game goes on don't hesitate to use sentry energy to make a hallucinated phoenix to get a scout of basically everything. It's as effective a scout as an overseer is. If you aren't scouting and they make voidrays unchecked, you WILL lose. I think the only way to properly ""counter"" voidrays, at least with Twilight tech, is with Archons. And Archons are super expensive.  Stargate vs Robo: You know what kind of units come out of a Stargate? Flying units. You know what a Robo can NEVER make? Units that attack up. Voidrays will absolutely destroy anything that comes out of the Robo, so if you make them just be sure not to get into any dicey situations against stalkers. Oracles are another great scouting tool, and can REKT an unprotected mineral line. Phoenix are great harassment units, if you have the micro for them. And one thing to keep in mind is that Phoenix are pseudo-spellcasters. You may see their pick up beam used most often to harass workers, but it can be used to great effect in an engagement too. If your opponent has nothing but blink stalkers, there really aren't many good targets to pick up (although sometimes taking 3-4 stalkers out of the fight can mean the difference between losing an engagement and winning it). But do they have some pesky immortals tearing your army a new one? Pick it up. Are you trying to walk up their ramp to kill them, but a sentry is being a cheeky bastard and forcefielding you out? Pick it up.   Fast expand vs DT: DT wins. End of story. Does the non-DT player not have detection? DT wins. Everytime. No exception. EDIT: May not be entirely factual, but if they skipped detection tech/units it's really bad for them. Or if you rushed into DT before they got detection tech up after the nexus. Also I figure even if they do get detection tech but not enough units to actually kill DTs, you're also going to be in a good spot. I played some practice games a while back to make my stargate opener safe vs DT and discovered that a DT rush hits at 7:00, pretty consistently. If you want to use a robo to get an obs, you need to start it exactly 1 minute and 30 seconds BEFORE you need detection. That gives you enough time for the robo to finish and for you to chrono out an obs. At that point a DT opener is almost entirely shutdown. Two things are important to note about DT openers, however. The first of which is it's popular right now to go DT --> fast expand behind it. Do with that what you will. The second thing to note is I broke my own ""record"" for rushing to DT in the last PvP I played. I saw only 1 gas on the first scout, so I knew either it was going to be a 4gate (no detection) or not very tech focused (very likely no detection, unless it's specifically prioritized). Do you want to lose to DTs? Because that's how you lose to DTs. On the followup scout after my cybercore finished (so when his finishes too) I scouted a Stargate. So IF he made an oracle and kept it at home, my DTs would get shut down. I also ""saw"" a second gas, but I was already committed pretty heavily to DTs and didn't notice it. What he ended up doing was going into phoenix (made 4 through the whole game) and was going to try to do a 3gate pressure/push with them. Probably because he kept seeing the only thing I had in my main was 1 stalker to defend the mineral line from flying units. What he didn't scout was my DT shrine and 2 quick warpgates. I played the 2gate DT rush crisply enough, cutting every corner I could without losing before DTs were out, to get DTs in his base at 6:30, maybe 6:40. That's at least 20 seconds(!) faster than what I thought the fastest possible time was. And every second matters when DTs are being made. It was instantly gg. If your opponent has a detection producing structure (robo and/or stargate) you shouldn't immediately think your DTs are dead. First of all you need to keep in mind that just because you can SEE the DTs, that doesn't mean the DTs are DEAD. Second, you can still kill the pylons powering the structures (or the structures themselves) before detection comes out. Know what you call a robo player who didn't make an obs while you're DT rushing after you kill the pylon(s) powering his robo? Dead. You call him dead. Do you know what you call a stargate player who couldn't desperately chrono out an oracle before you kill the powering pylon? You call them telekinetic. Because they are using their computer from 6ft under the ground.   General engagements: Like I said, PvP can sorta be compared to Roach vs Roach: whoever has more shit wins the fight. At least after forcefields stop being relevant. But even then forcefields will not save you early game if you cut too many corners. They are useful, but not useful enough to save your ass if you're already dead (either literally or in the numbers game before the fight happens). It's also important to note that the current meta's end all, be all, epitome of protoss power composition right now is Colossus/Archon/Immortal (in order of importance), with zealots sprinkled in with leftover minerals. That's is the endgame composition right now. The only thing that can ""beat"" it is SkyToss (I think), but if you're playing against SkyToss you should have already won before they're composition can beat Colossus/Archon/Immortal."
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,dundent,2,Fri Jul 10 20:54:42 2015 UTC,FYI 10 gate DT will hit around 5:40 (I think) and that is the fastest possible time you can get them. However if you see 10 gate into double gas it's DT/Proxy Oracle so just get cannon for ez win.
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,Artikash,2,Fri Jul 10 22:17:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've noticed this before. I've had diamonds call me a hacker when I either scout the obvious proxy locations and find their stargate or make phoenix to counter their proxy oracle (etc) after scouting double gas and no third pylon in their base. It's fairly obvious what you're doing. I don't see the DTs as much in PvP (granted PvP is the least common matchup on ladder right now), except for what I do. I've gotten pretty good at triple DT at ~7:00, if not slightly before.  The one game I've had so far where I got shutdown was the guy that was ALSO going DT, but got a safety robo back home. Also he didn't make 3 DTs, so he had units to defend at home. I yolo'd it hard and wasn't even mad.  Although... now that I'm around mid-masters, won't maphackers start to slowly become a thing? I'm willing to accept he was either A) playing safe, or B) not playing completely balls to the wall, and I'm not going to cry hacker every time I get countered like this, but I think it could actually start happening now. Good stuff."
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,dundent,2,Fri Jul 10 22:29:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't read everything, but I appreciate when people put effort into writing stuff in a manner that's easy to follow like you did. It's probably a good overview.  That being said, DTs don't straight up beat an expansion opener at all. In most cases, these 1 or 2 gate expands come with early detection, which shuts down any DT harassment pretty hard.   You'll be able to get a nexus behind it, yeah... but you'll be behind in economy. Your initial statement couldn't be more misleading. For such a plain statement, your answer is a little too elaborate. It's more like ""The DT player won't be able to do any significant damage and consequently fall behind in economy."""
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,vhapteR,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:08:44 2015 UTC,"To be fair I've only just started to truly dabble in DTs, so I haven't had first hand experience in every situation. However the one or two games of PvP I have played where the other guy got a quick nexus I did swiftly close out the game.  About when would nexus first get detection, whether it be robo/obs or stargate/oracle? Apparently ~6:00 is the absolute fastest you can get 1 DT in their base, and ~7:00 for my 2-3. Could detection (and units to kill DTs) be out before the DTs get there?  EDIT: Also I edited the big post to be slightly less misleading. I have a lot more experience with Stargate and Robo openers."
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,dundent,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:16:43 2015 UTC,"Nexus first... uh, people hardly ever go nexus first in PvP. I've done that myself a few time, but that was a blind hard counter to players who cut scouting all the time and opened DTs or did passive openers like 1 or 2 gate expand blindly.  So I suppose you're talking about a 1 or 2 gate expand with a nexus before your robo (nobody goes 1 base robo anyway... at least not passively or without any other tech).  I've done a lot of DT rushes succesfully in the past, probably more than any other build. I stole 3:45 twilight build (right after your cybercore finishes) from pros before those who don't follow the pro scene even knew about it. The fastest you can get inside your opponent's base with that build is about 6:30 and that's if you send a probe in and proxy a pylon, which probably won't go unnoticed against anything other than gateway all ins.   In that case, a fast expanding protoss with sentries will certainly be able to prevent DTs from getting inside his base. You can hit his expansion with DTs, but as long as your  opponent doesn't delay his robo for too long (5:00-5:30 is standard iirc), he'll be perfectly fine iirc.  If there's one build that is painful to play against when you open DTs, it's definitely 1 gate expands. And I'm talking about DT rushes, let alone regular DT builds that don't get such a blatant twilight (proxy or not, the fact that you're either going proxy stargate or dts is blatant).  As for crazy 10 gate DT rushes, I won't go into that because that's a very vulnerable build that dies to early pressure very easily, because you're simply hoping your opponent won't cross the map and start dealing damage immediately. I guess it can be an extremely powerful metagame build against certain players, but it's still a gimmick on the ladder. Not very reliable. I mean, 3:45 twilight probably isn't as good as it was a year ago anymore, but it's still far more stable than a 10 gate DT rush."
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,vhapteR,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:46:21 2015 UTC,"""Nexus first."" Wat. Yeah, I meant gate expand. Don't know what I was thinking, wrong matchup.  How crisp I execute it really varies, but here's a replay of me getting 3 to his ramp at 6:40, and in his mineral line at 7:00. Got another one where I was in the mineral line at 6:40, but that was A) with only 2, B) the pylon was basically the same distance from him as a good in-base pylon would be, and C) I knew I could cut SO MANY corners to rush DT.    5:00-5:30 is standard iirc    That might be the standard, but I know that it'll take 1 minute and 30 seconds to get an obs out (with chrono), so 5:30 would put the obs out at 7:00. Which is the average time for DTs to start killing things.  And it may be blatant that you're up to something, but unless you already have an answer started (or you IMMEDIATELY throw down a blind reaction that is correct), the answer probably won't be done before whatever you're doing shows up. Stuff takes too long to build. And there's less scouting for an expand in this matchup then the other ones. ...I have had so many terrans type to me something like ""weird build"" when it's 5:30 and my nat is still not down. And then a little over a minute later 2 voidrays and 3-4 stalkers show up in their natural. Half the time it's completely unscouted (and the half where it is, half of THAT time it works anyways).  I can't remember what drove me to start going DTs (maybe because PvP has been kinda rocky for me, but I almost never see it so it hasn't held me back), but I definitely know I immediately start going into it if I'm expecting a 4gate. Or at least if I see chrono's on their warpgate. Against 4gate your DTs are getting out either at the same time or before their first warp in is happening (since you're both chrono'ing the warp gate like crazy), so all you need is 1 DT at home and 1 DT in their base and the game is over. And if they're also rushing DT, well... I have more of them. The game I linked we both went DT, but I had 3 and he had 1, and he threw down a 5:30 robo (my robo got thrown down just in time to temporarily block his DT from getting to the mineral line... maybe a little late), so after I killed that pylon I could have basically just base traded with him."
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,dundent,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:25:55 2015 UTC,"I guess I didn't make it clear, but my point is that you can easily force field to buy time, so as long as your robo isn't too late you'll be able to prevent DTs from actually taking down your expansion. Force fielding your ramp until an observer comes out shouldn't be a problem at all, so your main will be perfectly safe.   If you're up against a more ""standard"" twilight timing (after your first stalker + msc + wg, just like in a blink build), that's even less of a concern."
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,vhapteR,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:16:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes more sense. I always like getting sentries for this very purpose, more often than not. ...and then the DTs show up when I'm look away from the ramp.  I haven't seen many sentries when I show up in their base. Normally I just find some stalkers. ...probably because they know some shenanigans are up, but they're preparing for proxy oracle. Either way I haven't played enough PvPs, especially against early expand, to have a reasonable idea of what I should be finding when I get there. So what you're saying is mostly the first I'm hearing about it. Again, I only JUST started going DTs."
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,dundent,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:25:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see. PvP has a lot of builds to choose from, but they're all very different. I for one hardly ever go stargate, and whenever I do it it's just a cheesy proxy stargate all in.  Robo expands in PvP generally get a sentry first so you can send a hallucinated phoenix or oracle to scout slightly before the 6 min mark. With 1-2 more sentries behind it, you're very safe against DTs. The real question is whether you can defend your nexus.  In that situation you mentioned, the tricky part is that a proxy oracle can hit really early, but they're usually not that hard to scout. Yeah, scouting around with your gateway units can be dangerous, but you can still scout with your msc briefly and remain active with your scouting probe.  I'm say you're wrong in that some people may prepare for proxy oracles and forget the possibility of DTs. That can be a tough call sometimes. But if they do commit to a regular gate expand and you go DTs, that's not good for you.   Keep in mind this is a very specific scenario where you do a 3:45 proxy twilight (which is somewhat similar to a proxy stargate, but not exactly the same because you can start your msc+ wg earlier), get scouted, and your opponent may choose the incorrect response. It can be a tricky situation, but it's by no means representative of DT builds in general. There is also 3:45 in-base twilight into DT rushes (which can be canceled as well) and ""regular"" DT builds that hit quite a bit later (not my thing to be honest)."
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,vhapteR,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:47:50 2015 UTC,"Macro/defensive Robo openings have always been my favorite. Started dabbling in macro Stargate openings this season (after losing HARD to phoenix openings too many times... come on, man, I want to be awesome like that too!). I've always preferred being the passive/defensive player, and I got pretty good at defending against aggressive players. It's usually the, coincidentally also, passive players that kill me. Almost never see them, and I can't get out of defensive mode quick enough to keep up in the macro and not lose 5 minutes later because they have more stuff. I've been roughly enjoying my YOLO DTs, though. They've been fun. Speaking of...   DT rush (which can be cancelled as well)   Dafuq? Hell no. When I've gone all-in, I am going all-in. I am either about to win by a mile or look like a complete noob in about 2 minutes after I throw down that Twilight. I'm going to Leroy Jenkins that shit.   I should go back to macro though. I'm not purely chasing a promotion anymore, I should get comfortable with playing straight up again. Except in PvT. Fuck PvT."
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,dundent,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:05:59 2015 UTC,Any fast expand build will auto have detection for when DTs hit. Almost all non-fast expand builds will too.
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,Emyndri,5,Sat Jul 11 22:04:52 2015 UTC,"-ish. There is adjustments you can make based on scouting and damage you can sneak in dispite being ""countered"". There are also the  1 base 2 techs builds. Like its not uncommon for oracle into blink to beat out a blink player, or a blink build to find enough damage vs a robo player. Also the 2 base tech builds like oracle into blink, or going blink and proxying  a star once you scout the robo build. There are some build orders in the archive. The most common build that I have been using and seeing lately is the 3 gate blink -->robo."
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,willdrum4food27,2,Fri Jul 10 14:57:43 2015 UTC,"I've been a big proponent of the 1 gate 1 robo expand. There's a build with a day9 walk through, IIRC it's cranks builds. Basically  12/13 gate Early 14 gas, 15 gas, pylon Cyber at 100% Msc + sentry + warp gate Pylon Scout Nexus then Robo Two more sentries Two more gates  From there you can either expand or if they've gone early aggression you can cancel and just keep pumping out immos   Immortal --> observer or observer --> immortal depending on scouting results   Only real weaknesses I've found against this build are oracle or void ray which should be scouted if the build is executed properly. It's still weak against those two but it's just takes a lil practice to deflect and you usually come out way ahead or just straight up win the game.   Generally you will have two or more forcefields to block any 4 gate nonsense, immortals in time for blink, obs for dt. If they fake pressure just hallucinate and scout, and I usually find the number of immortals is enough to beat their army comp if they've expanded, and bait an overcharge.   Alternatively you should be ahead in the expansion game if they don't go straight up aggro.   From there you just rally immos and gateway units if you are attacking, and you will sustain some losses but you can generally overpower them even with shit micro like mine :)"
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,xhollowpointx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:36:11 2015 UTC,"I hear you on that, but generally I've found that if they pressure with stalk you just keep them out until you get an immortal or two. From there it's a matter of widdling down their army and you should be ahead in tech as is.   It's not your typical pvp where an engagement is just super lopsided and the game ends. I've had the most success by hitting a three immortal timing, ffing their ramp and destroying the nexus if they expand.   It definitely does have weaknesses and isn't sound proof, but the scouting and making sure you're not late on anything drastically increases the efficiency of the build.   The generally theory is that you are getting really far ahead in tech, while getting a rather early expo for pvp. Your Msc will have an overcharge for 4 gate, sentries to keep them in your nat and when the first ff runs our, you immos should be out and ready to clean up.  Granted I'm on the cusp or masters, and I'm sure higher level opponents would find holes in this, but I've only had a few players be able to scout the build, see what is happening and react accordingly so they aren't miles behind. It's a pretty uncommon build, but it definitely has its place."
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,xhollowpointx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:48:04 2015 UTC,Zzzzzzz accidently deleted my post fucking mobile lol. Eh the issue isn't their pressure the issue is them sitting under your ramp with ffs. Then expand waaaaay before you. Or you just run into a faster expand build that you are simply behind against. Immortal pushes are extremely weak to forcefields so getting anything done with them (dif maps help or hurt more) simply shouldn't happen. To me thus sounds like a build that's good at beating people worse then you along the lines of dt robo. And yeah the general weakness to star play is no fun (even worse then dt robo)  edit: to me I just feel you are better off going to 1 extreme or the other. Do the full dt robo or a defensive blink robo or do the gate FE.
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,willdrum4food27,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:10:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah the scouting is the most important part of the build. Everything should line up to deflect any early game bs with the exception of proxy all in sg builds, but you should be able to scout that. If they're going for straight stalker/zealot sentry aggression the over charge and forcefields should let you hold, with minimal losses. Go watch the day 9 video, he explains it in great detail.   Somewhere in here, at work currently:  http://day9.tv/d/Day9/day9-daily-665/  Edit: it may be p2,p3,or p4. Overall good walk through to watch though!"

allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,willdrum4food27,-1,Fri Jul 10 17:45:16 2015 UTC,"Ummmmmm, getting ahead while playing as safe as possible is the entire game. It's a balance of being as greedy as possible with regards to resources/tech while ensuring that you are safe against aggression/minimizing losses, whether that be standard play or all ins.   This build satisfies those requirements, taking into account a good majority of the bullshit intended to break you in the early game, with a few exceptions. For that we must scout and react accordingly.   If you review the build, the nexus should be finishing just before your robo is finishing. From there you need to identify if there is a push coming and the composition. Timing will be everything, you may need to cancel, you may need to eat some shield/hp damage points on the nexus, but you will be able to hold if you react accordingly. This identification will dictate your response/usage of the robo and gates.   While there are exceptions if you want to play devil's advocate, please try to keep the meta in perspective and realize that for the better part of both games, pvp has been hyper aggressive. That's not to say it's always this way, but as far as ladder is concerned I rarely see a two base build from an opponent, where I did not set the tempo with this opener first.   Very rarely do I see any super early expansions in pvp as there are simply too many different types of aggression that will put you behind/break you.  Perhaps that's different in higher leagues, but idk I'm just a poor diamond pleb.   I personally have not seen any Ps willing to risk 2-300 gas to keep me contained either. It's simply too risky imo.   90% of maps don't have one ff ramps leaving the natural, so a well placed Pylon on the high ground in your main will allow you to warp in units, giving some buffer to the oc, allowing you time to get your immortals out and in a good posture.   The game is very similar to playing a guitar. The small licks and demonstrations of finesse make for entirely different styles and outcomes. There's no one build that satisfies all these requirements, you still have to perform the finer points of the game, but you have to experiment to find them out and when to use them. It's not as binary as you are suggesting, IMHO.   Also before we get all condescending with our little emotes, why don't we review then vs than.   Build a is better than build b. If I do this, then I do this..."

allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,willdrum4food27,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:52:43 2015 UTC,"You didn't even review the build lmao. You're arguing that an opener is weak because there are a couple of weaknesses to it, while it covers a broad range of aggression. Nexus finishes before 4 gate and blink, overcharge buys you time. It's like you're arguing that an opener is weak because if you dont scout, it has chinks in the armor. No opener will be 100% effective, especially if you dont scout. The only way to be ahead on expo timing, and hold the counter is if I don't scout and let you sit there. A simple hallucination should show you how many probes are mining if they've expanded, and their army composition. At this point you counter or go an alternate route to try and get back the advantages you gave up, or explore additional options. He ffs me out of my base? I put a Pylon on the edge and warp in, or chrono a wp out during the oc to drop some immos. Your expansion stands with small reactions."
allthingsprotoss,3csxgu,xhollowpointx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:55:20 2015 UTC,"Im gonna be honest with you. The probability of facing cheese in pvp is greater than that of facing a macro styled build.

Getting +1 out that early is super strong."

allthingsprotoss,3cq0k2,incens,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:54:48 2015 UTC,You can play Disruptor Stalker/Adept vs the composition but you have to out position your opponent.  Force fights away from small choke points so you can dance away from Lurkers.    You can always play base trade vs Lurker players if you are good at keeping your Observers alive.
allthingsprotoss,3cq0k2,phantommonster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:45:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah the main strats have been explained. You really don't beat them straight up. The things I usually do are:    2 Adepts from 2 gates off a 17 nexus first into a fast twilight for shield upgrade and 5ish more gates for a big gateway all in follow up. This hits before lurkers are really to much of a factor. I usually send 2 adepts into the main and have them Shift-click target fire down all of the drones while the main attack pressures the third or natural.  sit back and mass carriers off a fast 3rd base. I find this boring but it really is the only way you can fight zerg straight up without having a ton more army supply than them now.  Endless hurassment with lots of observers adepts and stalkers keep the zerg on less bases than you with a few disruptors. I don't think this strategy is that good because how difficult it even is to kill a single lurker if it has any protection at all. If the zerg builds static and spreads lurkers you pretty much just lose because you don't have the ability to mass carriers really.    Also if you thought roach, hydra, lurker was strong try fighting hydra, lurker, viper, ultra without mass carriers. I don't think its really possible outside of maybe like 10 disruptors hitting everything."
allthingsprotoss,3cq0k2,avengaar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:30:59 2015 UTC,can you elaborate on the 2 adepts from the 2 gates? When do you build the gates? Do you build a forge?
allthingsprotoss,3cq0k2,4rChon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:02:52 2015 UTC,I want both the gates to be up when your cyber core finishes. So after the nexus you drop your gateway at your front. No forge until much later. I didn't get bane busted 3 times on ladder today so I mean that kinda kills it.

If you go robo they can just go for some mutas and stall you until they get a lot of lurkers and support, and if you go straight air you become vulnerable to a lot of early pushes I think"

allthingsprotoss,3cltos,ReachH,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:47:12 2015 UTC,I feel like the golds aren't that bad on this map since you can harass behind the minerals.

allthingsprotoss,3cn7ni,Billythisis,2,Thu Jul 9 05:27:59 2015 UTC,"You add your gateways pretty late. I would cut probes when you have 6 at your natural, to lay down the +2 gates and robo then just resume chronoboosted probe production right away. With the timing you used in the replay, the earliest you could've warped in was when he was moving into your base. Also, your mothershipcore is way out of position. Once the stalkers pop your MSC should be positioned between the natural and main so you can overcharge any nexus instantly. In this game, your MSC was so far away that the Terran got time to move up your main.  So pause probe-production at 6 at your nat, then add the gateways + robo and remember to position the MSC better. When your gateways finish with warpgate, you can just instantly warp in 3 additional stalkers to help defend these kinds of pushes.  The 2nd game is just poor decision making and bad execution. You spot 2rax and gas so you know there's aggression coming your way. However, you forget to build your first stalker for 20 seconds and chronoboost probes instead of the stalkers. It's especially important to chrono stalkers after you've spotted 3 reapers. Vs this you can actually just do the standard buildorder but cut probes from 1-base until you've put down all production (3gates + robo). From there you just defend from 2-base and macro up while making sure you take no probe-losses. There was no reason for you to move out with your stalkers, you just had to defend. If the Terran commits to that many reapers without getting any value out of them, it's basically just free-win for you if you don't take damage. But your entire build was just messy: supply blocks, forgetting to build probes, losing probes, NOT SPENDING CHRONOBOOST etc. So next time, just defend and keep doing your normal buildorder but chrono stalkers and make sure to set up a good defense."

allthingsprotoss,3cn7ni,aihyur,2,Thu Jul 9 13:04:20 2015 UTC,"You should always get blink! In both games. Every time you open twilight you get Blink. Go Blink -> go up to 6 probes at nat -> add 2x Gates, 1 robo -> resume probe production."

So if you're not going to be aggressive with the stalkers, I'd recommend u chrono probes instead."

And to be fair my absolute worst protoss matchup back in the day was PvZ, because I felt like I had no idea what to do (granted this was during the height of Broodlord/Infestor).

When it's time to macro and take engagements my APM can get over 200, when I'm really on point. Generally it's somewhere between 100 and 150. And the longer the game goes on, aka the longer the average is exposed to my APM when shit is actually happening in the game, my average climbs.

Protoss is for sure a stylistic race (twilight vs robo vs stargate openings for example) so as far as what is the best build for you it comes down to what you enjoy and what lines up with your skillset the best so yeah peak through the archive and see what looks like your cup of tea (they are also arranged in chronological order)  There is also this link in the sidebar
allthingsprotoss,3cezma,x_kuro,2,Tue Jul 7 11:51:53 2015 UTC,"Once you identify that it's happening.  If you don't have enough units to defend both bases, simply transfer the probes to one base, there is no point in risking them and you will simply lose trying to run from one base to another. I don't know how you start, but people I think mostly do 1 gate expand into robo, make sure you have two stalkers from that first gate and block the ramp to prevent helions to come in, let them roam on your natural since you don't have any probes there anyways. And obviously start making observers and more stalkers and so on. I think these builds are really weak against two base pushes, assuming your didn't lose anything to harass."
allthingsprotoss,3cezma,VELL1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:56:16 2015 UTC,"For me, I've always had success with quick stargate openers vs this.  Not only does the oracle enable scouting, but it also deals enormous damage vs mines and hellions, as well as providing detection.  I specifically go straight up to stargate before nexus and make a pair of oracles (personal choice, 1 oracle is fine too) right off the bat.  If the terran is coming at me with hellions a second stalker holding on the ramp +the oracle will sweep him.  If he's going drops, making a nix +the 2 oracles is an almost guaranteed kill, as he cant drop anything without the oracles gibbing it, while the nix will eventually kill the medi, and can lift the mines before they burrow.  3 rax can be a bit of a hassle if you slip on your macro (and if you're like me, nix collossus in general is a game of inches until 15 minutes), but if your disdain for handling factory outweighs your lack of confidence in your ability to hold stim timings, you should give it a go."
allthingsprotoss,3cezma,Elcactus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:47:52 2015 UTC,"I hate widow mines.

For defense, i have 1 stalker and msc to deal with reapers and i leave a probe to check for their move outs and when they move out i warp in 2 sentries and then if it's an all in i'll warp in 2 zealots after that. If it's super heavy pressure the two photon overcharges plus forcefield to keep them from running into the main is enough to keep them at bay until i get dts."
allthingsprotoss,3cezma,AmnesiA_sc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:03:45 2015 UTC,"Basically, having observers and pylons around the map are the best counters to these drops. Map control and observers (make at least 3 against terran) are critical and can prevent a plethora of drops. I usually keep one to the sides of my base and keep one with my army.   Also, if you're teched enough, keeping a hightemplar in each nexus is a solid strategy. It can feedback the medivacs and the stalkers can clean up the job. Remember to warp in zealots when you see a drop because stalkers aren't as strong at defending.   For the hellions, its all about keeping your calm and not panicking. Most terran get lots of probe kills from the hellions because the protoss doesn't move the probes or moves them without thinking. Try to make it so you get the least casualties from the hellions. Also remember that if you lose 4, its not the end of the world. Stay focused on the game and think of it as a minor setback."
allthingsprotoss,3cezma,kirisakichann,-2,Tue Jul 7 22:11:18 2015 UTC,You should counter with blink after defending.
allthingsprotoss,3ce39w,Artikash,5,Tue Jul 7 04:54:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah your build is ridiculously greedy, but also you're quite late on your gateways.  You put them down at 7:30 when they could have gone down at 7 minutes. That gets them finished by 8 minutes which is right before this push hits. So you could honestly still do the build your doing but just making sure you get the gates down at the time you actually can, and you should be fine.  3 rax pushes are a bit difficult but since they're so heavy on the units, remember that they're quite low on SCVs so its ok to pull all the probes immediately if you think you wont hold it so that you can instantly snow balll the fight into your favor. If you pull a lot of probes at the start then he will firstly back up and rethink the engage, but also won't kill as many because more will be doing damage. This means that his units will die faster obviously. It's actually worse to pull less because it's not as intimidating and it won't make them 2nd guess their attack, so he'll just engage and you're guaranteed to lose every probe you pull.   You also overcharge very early, always make sure you wait until he's actually in range otherwise that is wasted seconds that the nexus isn't firing. And if you can try to block him from going up the ramp with the probes so he stays in overcharge range.  However if you get the gates up in time and just warp in constantly you should be pretty OK anyway without having to sac that many probes.  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR you can do a different build that goes stargate and 2 oracles first into 2 extra gates while getting 2 stalkers out of the first gate and apply pressure while he's pressuring you at the same time so he loses SCVs while he already doens't have many to begin with and then you clean up at home with 3 gates worth of production. That's how I like to go about it."
allthingsprotoss,3ce39w,Gemini_19,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:17:45 2015 UTC,"I see, will make sure to make the gates at 7 from now on. However, I usually put down the nexus cannon a few seconds early so that it's hitting enemy units immediately when they come in to vision. Is this a bad idea?"
allthingsprotoss,3ce39w,Gemini_19,2,Tue Jul 7 05:53:03 2015 UTC,You should really wait until he's farther in so that way if he decides to retreat then he's taking damage the entire time he's leaving.

allthingsprotoss,3ce39w,gregjazz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:19:54 2015 UTC,Yeah you need to judge it based on when you see the army coming. But in the replay you overcharged a good like 2-3 seconds before he was even in range so that was also some wasted shots.
allthingsprotoss,3ce39w,JustSomeCollegeGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:30:01 2015 UTC,"Whenever I do a 1 gate expo build, I usually get a sentry after the first stalker.

allthingsprotoss,3ce39w,gregjazz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:48:39 2015 UTC,I find myself strapped for gas a lot so I try not to make sentries in PvT until ~9 mins. Low ground robo gets colossi to the front lines a little bit faster and it's harder to scan.
allthingsprotoss,3ce0w6,Tasmya,8,Tue Jul 7 04:30:20 2015 UTC,"If you're new to protoss and new to the game overall, I'd recommend learning the 4 gate.  It's a classic protoss all in strategy that teaches you all of the basics for the game and the race, likehow to follow a build order, rudimentry micro and macro, chrono boost management, unit matchups (what to do when they respond with lings, or roaches, marines or marauders, etc) and  managing a spell caster in the form of the mothership core.  You should move on to more macro based builds once you have this down, but it's a good starter strategy."
allthingsprotoss,3ce0w6,Elcactus,2,Tue Jul 7 15:08:50 2015 UTC,"if you want to achieve playing at a competent level at this game, then my advice for starting out is to focus on making workers and spending money.  (start with one base, and as you  get more comfortable with these two steps (called macro), move onto taking more bases!). micro is the other side of the game, where you try to utilize your attacking units to their highest potential.  it's easy to get too focused on micro, but i promise you, if you put most of your effort into macro, you will have much more success in the short term and long term of playing sc2.   if you are just playing for fun, try out all 3 races, possibly by playing as ""random"", and just try to play the way that you get the most enjoyment from.  gl and hf on ladder :D"

allthingsprotoss,3ce0w6,notjustjon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:31:50 2015 UTC,"so in terms of good unit compositions (this what we call your attacking units that make up your army) there are many that are viable on the highest level of the game for each match up (protoss vs zerg or terran or protoss).  until you reach this level of play, you can make pretty much any unit comp work if your macro, decision making, and mechanics are good enough.    the simple answer to your question, is that for protoss, your basic gateway units (zealot, stalker, sentry, to be exact) become pretty weak on their own in the later stages of the game.  to alleviate this weakness, you generally want to mix in stronger units into your unit composition. examples of this range from the ground aoe units, such as colossus and high templar (for storm).  other popular options include immortals, voidrays and archons.   now, this is the response i would give someone that is playing near the highest level of the game, the alternate response is that you can literally make any unit composition work if your macro and mechanics are good enough.  this is why in my first comment i suggested just simply try to make as many attacking units as possible and not worry about the micro or unit compositions as of yet."
allthingsprotoss,3ce0w6,McVomit,3,Tue Jul 7 22:34:10 2015 UTC,"Play the campaigns! Unfortunately the first two campaigns are for Terran(WoL has 4 Protoss missions in it :D) and Zerg respectively, but you should still play them just to get a simple understanding of the basics of the game and rts' in general.(I honestly believe that if all bronze/silver players played the campaigns until they could beat them on hard then they'd get into gold)  Once you do that, you can start working on the mechanics of Protoss. I'd suggest checking out the ""youtube series"" section of the sidebar. As well as the IMBAbuilds link below it. Of course, if you ever have specific questions you can always ask them here!

allthingsprotoss,3cb2y0,taomcdohl,2,Thu Jul 9 21:02:22 2015 UTC,"Here's my experience, as someone who started in bronze in 2013 and has slowly worked his way to diamond.  Every time you promote for the first time, you're going to go through growing pains as you learn the meta of the league, understand the speed increase, and generally get beaten by people who will punish you for loose builds.  Now that you've hit gold league, you need to find one build per match up.  The thing about Protoss is that we don't have that ""generic macro build"" that zerg and Terran can use.  Terran can just promote up by refining a single build that branches.  Zerg as well.  But with Protoss, we're very dependent upon specific builds and timing windows.  As you promote, you'll those window will shrink.  The window for a 4-gate in silver league is MUCH wider than in Master league (as an example).  You WILL lose games when you first promote.  Each loss is a victory, though, in that you have a learning experience.  If you need builds, you can check out imbabuilds.com."

allthingsprotoss,3cadyi,skanetiger,6,Mon Jul 6 10:31:45 2015 UTC,"When I was first starting in SC2, a masters player in one of my old clans just told me to 4 gate every match up until I got out of bronze. Their reasoning was that it teaches you the basics of unit control, reading/memorizing build orders, macro as well as gave me a few wins which really boosted my early confidence.   9 Pylon 12 Gateway + Probe Scout [1] 14 Assimilator 16 Pylon @100% Gateway: Cybernetics Core, Zealot[2] @100% Zealot: 21 supply-> Stalker @100% Cybernetics Core: Warpgate Research @50% Warpgate Research: 3 Gateways (4 total) @90% Warpgate Research: Proxy Pylon   Literally, do this every game. Remember, many of these Korean builds were made with the meta in the Korean pro-scene (Proleague, GSL, etc.) Things like battle-cruisers aren't really happening. Thats just my 2 cents. Dont overload yourself with a build you may not understand. Start small then work your way up. Again, I may be totally wrong and one of these higher level toss players may have a better way of learning, but that's just what I did."
allthingsprotoss,3cadyi,gkconnor91,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:48:21 2015 UTC,I will give it a try this evening and see how it does me. Bronze seems 75% Terran at the moment so this should be a good way to pressure them early. Any suggestions with regards to the comp from 4 gate? All stalkers? Mix?
allthingsprotoss,3cadyi,KOUJIROFRAU,2,Mon Jul 6 10:57:02 2015 UTC,"For the unit composition, it depends on the matchup.  PvT - Prioritize stalkers against marines and zealots against marauders. Add sentries if you need forcefields and haven't ended the game yet. PvZ - Prioritize stalkers against roaches/slow lings and zealots against speedlings/large numbers of slow lings. Sentries are always useful if you badly need to spend gas. PvP - Prioritize stalkers always, and warp in zealots if you run out of gas. Make sure to always hit your warp in cycles."
allthingsprotoss,3cadyi,VonBlood008,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:43:14 2015 UTC,"To add to this; I wouldn't make more than 2 or 3 sentries until you feel like you have time to do something else while attacking and warping in. Especially vs. Terran, just pop Guardian Shield (amazing against Marines) and focus on controlling / warping in more units until you feel comfortable enough to add Forcefields."

Didn't really scout so guess I need to focus on doing this more. Thanks everyone for the advice! Any tips with regards to micro and positioning? In the first game my zealots got blocked behind the stalkers at the base of the ramp. I am guessing having them in front is important!
allthingsprotoss,3cadyi,SexBobomb,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:18:09 2015 UTC,What did you learn after 4gate? I managed to get gold with 4gate only last season. It was my first season as well and it was actually hillariously easy. But now i dont know what to do. Tried 1gate fe a lot but didn't really worked well since im bad at scouting and reacting to things they throw at me.
allthingsprotoss,3cadyi,gkconnor91,2,Mon Jul 6 11:23:46 2015 UTC,"One build per matchup, just go on imbabuilds and find something that looks fun and keep trying it, it doesn't really matter what - don't let anyone tell you what build to have fun with or suits your playstyle - macro, cheese, whatever, constant repetition and refinement will get you advancing"
allthingsprotoss,3cadyi,IWatchFatPplSleep,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:31:59 2015 UTC,"IMO, at gold you should be developing your play style for the way you want to approach the game. For example, if you like one base silliness, you could do stuff like 4 gate warp prism, proxy robo, proxy tempest, proxy void ray. I like skytoss, so I started doing stuff like carrier timings, mass oracle, chargelot voidray."
allthingsprotoss,3cadyi,IWatchFatPplSleep,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:30:27 2015 UTC,I guess I was trying to develop a play style too early in my SC2 life. I am not too keen to be a cheeser (is 4 gate a cheese?). I am more interested in building the later game army comps but the frustration of dealing with Terran has led me to feel like I need to be better at early agression
allthingsprotoss,3cadyi,IWatchFatPplSleep,2,Mon Jul 6 14:07:11 2015 UTC,"The way I've always seen it :   Bronze - Cheese Silver - 1 base all in Gold - Early 2 base all in Plat - Late 2 base all in/3 base all in Diamond - Macro (i.e. Late game) Masters - Don't know, will tell you when I get there"
allthingsprotoss,3cadyi,KOUJIROFRAU,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:26:27 2015 UTC,Interesting the Diamond guy who has been giving me advice told me to nail down 1 gate fast expand and I would get through quick. It does me well for winning 60% of my games but then if I meet a silver or someone going for terran mass air I get destroyed.
allthingsprotoss,3cadyi,gkconnor91,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:49:36 2015 UTC,If we all went Macro all the time it would be better in the long run because we would improve our skills quicker. But I see so many gold and plat players who try to go macro but have no idea how to defend an all-in. I just don't think it is a great idea to aim for a 3 base economy when you can barely control  1 base worth of units/production.  I'm diamond and I struggle to keep up with a 2 base economy some times. I lower league player doesn't know how to respond well to their scouting information. So instead of making a fuck ton of mistakes trying to learn early game scouting I think you time is better put into learning to control 1 or 2 bases and how to defend cheese.  Just my 2 cents though. Most important thing is to have fun.
allthingsprotoss,3cadyi,IWatchFatPplSleep,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:47:53 2015 UTC,After 4 gate I did 3 gate robo every matchup.
allthingsprotoss,3cadyi,Zebrahead_III,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:23:54 2015 UTC,"Not exactly an accurate build order if you're talking about the 1 base 4 gate  9 pylon chrono 11th probe 12 gate chrono 13th probe 14 assimilator 16 pylon @100% gate, cyber @100 minerals, zealot @100% cyber, warpgate (chrono constantly) and 1st stalker stop probe production at 16 on minerals, 3 on gas @450 minerals, 3 gates (should be immediately after your second chrono on WG research) @100% 1st stalker, 2nd stalker start proxying pylons as soon as you get the money, you can place about 4 and still hit your first warp-in of 4 stalkers. Benchmark: 1 zealot 6 stalkers at ~5:35; 5:45 is the latest you should be warping in.   You can send your probe scout out after the 12 gate on 2 player maps if you're very paranoid about cheese, after the 14 gas on 2 player maps if you're slightly less paranoid about cheese/on 4 player maps if you want to comfortably scout the opponent's location, or after the cyber core on any map if you feel confident."
allthingsprotoss,3cboiv,OneManMagicShow,3,Mon Jul 6 17:39:29 2015 UTC,"I think I can prolly answer this. The current pro meta is blink stalker sentry and most people like to copy pros. The current zerg meta is a lot of timings attacks then blords if the game is still going.  There are reasons for this meta but that's not really the topic here. So that makes forge openings and stargate openings a little off meta, so less people are gonna do them.   Then blink sentry can be very aggressive and what not. But frankly being confident and aggressive with it isn't very low level friendly. Its more mechanically intensive, more scouting based etc etc. So lower level protoss just bottle up hoping to hold some sort of roach hydra push they expect to hit them instead of scouting and moving out on the map and using blink FFs and recall to take good trades.   also EU has a reputation to have less allins."
allthingsprotoss,3cboiv,willdrum4food27,2,Mon Jul 6 19:15:07 2015 UTC,"I understand this and i completely agree with you , but dosent make you protosses valnurable to zerg timings? I mean i practised a hydra-speedling push into roach-hydra-viper timing strategy for  severel days and now my zvp winrate is 100% ( havent lost a single zvp for 3 weeks) . Due to the fact that you play passivly , any zerg above gold can practise a build for days to perfect it and because of the fact that you dont interrept us with agression zergs should have an easy time executing the timing perfectly and kill the protoss. Then why dont we see this? I just dont get it why zergs are stupid not do like this. :))"
allthingsprotoss,3cboiv,willdrum4food27,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:34:09 2015 UTC,"yes being passive does 100% make you vulnerable to later timings. But there is a reason they are low diamond ;), they are prolly carried by the games that zerg does something like a flat hydra ling allin that you wouldn't want to push into, hold it, get ahead, then counter later. Or zergs that aren't hitting crisp timings and what not (like if your viper timing is hitting at 16mins instead of 14 and he has a bunch of Templar and storm) or by having better micro then their opponents. Frankly it is far from true that any zerg above gold can execute a build crisply. Hell I hit a masters zerg yesterday that was floating 1k/400 ish resources while burrow roach allining me (macro hatch was super late). Executing a crisp timing and then controlling it half decently is enough to get you masters (more or less, prolly need to add in some ok cheese/allin Defense) at this point."
allthingsprotoss,3cboiv,avengaar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:39:48 2015 UTC,"Harassment units don't as easily fall into standard PvZ comps (oracle, pheonix, dt, warp prism) and are a large commitment for a very gas hungry race.

Gateway + tempests is really good in my opinion, and I'm sure gateway carrier would be too.  Here's a game casted by a buddy of mine with that style played by me: http://youtu.be/NScTKqsC7gI"
allthingsprotoss,3c8mq1,Anthony356,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:36:53 2015 UTC,"I saw both of your casted games. I really enjoy the use of adepts within these builds. They really fill a nice early-mid game role that was severely lacking in HOTS skytoss builds. I'm going to give it a shot with carriers and see how it goes. I think adepts plus the skytoss buff will make PvT carrier timings (a la Pigbaby) much more effective. For PvP, ill just give a 4 gate with adepts a try lol. They seem to really fill a role that allows toss to be much more diverse in their mind-late game tech."

allthingsprotoss,3c3c79,Wolfkiller443,2,Sat Jul 4 10:37:44 2015 UTC,"Do not take this the wrong way, but in Silver anything is viable. The biggest thing holding you back are your mechanics, and in some small part scouting.  The lower leagues (Bronze-Gold) are a stomping ground for cheesers. The key to promotion and getting up towards plat is being able to hold, deflect, and punish cheese. And it's going to be cheese of all kinds. There are a million ways to ""effectively"" cheese in Silver. And by ""effectively,"" I mean manage to win. The best you can hope to do is work on your macro, keep up worker production, try to not get supply blocked, and getting scouting information (preferably in that order).   In PvP at least, 3gate robo depending on how you do it is good because you can use the gates to deflect a 4gate, if controlled properly, and the robo will protect you from DTs. In PvT... robo is good at giving you detection for Widow Mines. In Diamond it seems like every goddamn terran is doing this stupid widow mine drop. It's so good, and so goddamn annoying to deal with. I've started just either 4gating, proxy 2gating, or 3gate proxy voidray'ing to cheese out either a win or a loss early. If the game isn't over by the 10 minute mark, I've spent more time than I want to in the game. In PvZ I know that there are ways up opening with a gateway, and not just always FFE'ing, but... I don't feel comfortable doing it. I NEED to FFE just to feel safe.  But again, macro macro macro. The person that manages to keep their production queue filled the best will win the match, more often than not. Don't worry about if something is viable or not yet, you can make anything work if you get good enough at executing it. Zealot/Archon in PvT was killed in the the higher level meta by how good widow mines are, but in Silver you can still make that composition work. And more than likely make a couple people rage because they think it's so imba because they didn't beat it.  Try out the race, see if you like it, and see how you like playing it. Each tech choice has it's benefits and weaknesses, and you'll discover all of that as you play around with them. And remember, the most important thing that you can work on right now is macro, scouting, and most importantly staying calm while you play. Also learning how to use our spellcasters (sentries, HT, oracles, etc) effectively wouldn't hurt. You may or may not know this, but Psi Storm is HATED in the lower leagues. If you can tech into storm and learn how to use it well, you will probably win a lot of your (PvT and PvZ) games."

I would recommend learning to expand and then get 7 gate robo, you could forge fast expand or 1 gate expand just remember to always wall vz zerg"
allthingsprotoss,3c3c79,vpercevic,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:56:39 2015 UTC,Not even close to viable but you'll still beat everyone with it if you get your macro good enough.
allthingsprotoss,3bzjg3,MagicRover,3,Fri Jul 3 12:30:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with ROG about early cannons, I've been going early blink with a cannon at main and natural for mine drops which I see in over half of games. It makes life much easier at the start and then you can get map control with blink before going into colossus.  Another thing that really helps is building pylons for vision when taking a 3rd. I know this might be a waste of resources if Terran keeps picking them off, but it's really helpful to have 2 or 3 along main drop paths with observers covering air paths. Even if you aren't watching the mini map they will often unload to take out the pylon and bring your attention to their location. Plus you have forward/harass warp-ins :)"
allthingsprotoss,3bzjg3,DarkTurtle7,3,Fri Jul 3 15:17:16 2015 UTC,"Well, to take a third base in PvT you pretty much need blink. Without blink it's close to impossible to kill off the medivacs if the Terran controls it right. The 2nd most important thing would be map vision. You don't necessarily need 5 observers covering every drop path but you could have one observer outside his base to see if he is moving out with his army. If he hasn't, you can safely spread your army to deal with the drops because you know his whole army won't be pushing half your army from any position. Therefore he is limited to drops, and stalkers can be placed in your main while the rest of your army can be positioned at your third, UNTIL you know he is pushing out with his entire army, because then you will need the stalkers to kill the vikings.  Also, remember to position your MSC between your natural and main so you can overcharge faster if he drops you. Then you have to make a decision judging by how much he dropped and how many units you'll need to pull to defend. A 2-medivac drop could probably be defended with the pre-positioned stalkers, overcharge and warp-ins for instance, while a 4-medivac drop might require you to pull parts of your army to defend.  Buildorder and execution is also a huge point in this matchup. If you mess up your build, forget to make probes, take worker-losses, delay anything, you can easily be stuck with way less units than what you could've had if you executed your build correctly. A good example of this is forgetting constant colossus production/getting supply blocked. That way you can easily end up with 1-2 colossus less when he pushes you.  in the later stages of the game, when you want to start looking into taking a third and moving out to finish the game, you want to spread HTs and cannons around your bases. If you don't, the Terran can just drop you every time you move out and base-trade you to the point where you'll lose even if your army is 10x stronger than his.   Also, if you're struggling a lot with taking a third you might want to try DT-drops into a third. It can make it a lot easier."
allthingsprotoss,3bzjg3,aihyur,3,Fri Jul 3 13:46:15 2015 UTC,"Well, to take a third base in PvT you pretty much need blink.   Or phoenix."
allthingsprotoss,3bzjg3,Gemini_19,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:18:47 2015 UTC,I think phenix are the best. Throw a star gate down once you have third colossus on the way and make two or three phenix; make sure threw the game you keep three they always useful! they force drops ships back. They also ensure the drops will die! Stalkers let them get away too much n look for another spot.
allthingsprotoss,3bzjg3,Ichoose23,2,Wed Jul 8 17:10:34 2015 UTC,"YOu need more than 3 phoenix to deter drops, especially when they start doing 2+ medivacs.  Getting them after 3 colossi is also extremely late and past the time they would be of the most use."
allthingsprotoss,3bzjg3,Gemini_19,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:34:51 2015 UTC,i use them in conjunction with with units and chase them off the map. if you know there are two drop ships outside your base just waiting for u to move u cant ever attack(this u can argue but i like peace of mind!). 3 phoenix make them leave and stop the dropping. Im not sure the timing i use them most if its to expand to to attack after ive secured the 3erd. they are just too good to not make vs a T. theyve really made dealing with drops so much easier cuz you just kill them and thats the end!
allthingsprotoss,3bzjg3,Ichoose23,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:59:46 2015 UTC,I'm not saying they're bad but that the quantity and time you're using them is off.  You should be getting them when you start colossus production after an oracle opener so that by the time they try to do the first 10 minute drop you'll have 4 or 5 that can easily kill the medivacs.  If you make them as late as you do then they're already going to be on a high viking count and looking to go into ghosts and the drops are going to be more than 2 medivacs so 3 phoenix will do nothing to stop them. Sure it'll keep them from idling but if you're gonna make them for mid game you might as well do the 5-8 so you can actually kill the drops instead of just dissuade them.  I play a lot of phoenix/colossus in PvT so I'm pretty familiar with out the interactions work.
allthingsprotoss,3bzjg3,Gemini_19,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:02:24 2015 UTC,There isnt enough gas for that is there? Oh i see now. you really dont make many stalkers and dont get blink right away? I was thinking more on the concern that it feels helpless to push out vs T cuz they just going to drop so when i get to that point is when i like to add the phynox and make sure they skies are clear.
allthingsprotoss,3bzjg3,Ichoose23,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:28:55 2015 UTC,Yeah no you don't get blink or many stalkers. You use phoenix to defend vs drops and if they don't notice they will get smashed and you can do a good counter attack to end the game or just have a really big advantage taking your 3rd and going into storm.
allthingsprotoss,3bzjg3,Gemini_19,2,Wed Jul 8 19:31:07 2015 UTC,"6 stalkers in the main to stop drops (6 stalkers 2shot medivacs), main army between natural and third. msc between two or three of the bases dependant on the map.  one obs behind your main, one in the main attack path, possibly also spotting drops on the natural (on maps like King Sejong Station) and one in front of his natural, outside of the turret range, but in a spot where it can potentially see moveouts and drops.  once you are on three bases, after you add the standard 4 gates (to 10, to be able to hold scv pull), you can afford to build a cannon in your main and one other base of your choice (I usually do on the third). Spending those 900 minerals will leave you with enough gas to start templar archives (aim to start it at 12:00, so you have storm ready by 14:00), +2/+2 and charge (you should already have blink here)  if he drops the main, kill the medivacs first and warp zealots. if theres 3 or more medivacs you can overcharge.  if he drops the natural, you have the msc, your army and zealot warpins closeby for overcharge.   a drop on the third doesn't do anything differently than a ground attack to the third, since your army should be extremely close. Just kill his army.  No matter which base he drops, only use the units that are at that base (unless it's an obvious doom drop), since he will try to attack somewhere else at the same time. you can always warp zealots or dts to defend and you should always pull probes from the mineral line.  Later on you just put cannons and hts where you want to defend."
allthingsprotoss,3bzjg3,Dezib,2,Fri Jul 3 13:58:53 2015 UTC,"the issue with that defense setup is he can do larger drops in the main clear the stalkers and leave, or he can do bigger pushes at the 3rd and snipe the nexus before you can stop him. A lot of pros have been splitting their colossi as well as their stalkers and then use good obs placement combined with good judgement of how much army is all of terrans army  so seeing just  a piece should inform how to spilt up units.   Not to mention if you just have 6 stalkers and dont see the drop come in and focus fire the medi, even a 2 medivac drop will clear the stalkers at pretty much no lose (or of course the medivacs get a good angle past the stalkers)."

They are just so good vs mid game protoss"
allthingsprotoss,3bzjg3,HikyHiky,0,Sat Jul 4 12:47:26 2015 UTC,you dont need stalkers in your nat. you only make 6 stalkers and then go zealots.
allthingsprotoss,3bzjg3,Dezib,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:33:19 2015 UTC,"At the risk of being called a total noob, im gonna say it anyway. Cannons. I really feel like they are underused. One early on in the mineral line basically makes widow mine drops way less effective, and just adding more as time goes by in key locations act as a deterrent for drops, gives you a bit of time to respond appropriately if they do decide to commit, and reks medivacs with enough. I know lots of people use high templar at home too for feedbacks/storms, but im normally too afraid of it getting sniped or missing the storm etc.  One thing I'd say is make sure your nexus and photon cannons are sniping medivacs instead of bio and keep a bit of supply free for chargelot warpins to clean everything up on the ground. That combo normally means they run away and try to defend at home, or they lose the base race because I can focus most of my attention on their side of the map and they cant kite zelots/ focus fire the correct things and defend easily.  You would laugh if you ever saw my natural on Vaani."
allthingsprotoss,3bzjg3,_ROG_,2,Fri Jul 3 14:40:26 2015 UTC,"Cannons are OK, they buy you a few seconds. Stimmed bio chews through even multiple cannons too quickly to be considered a defence, more just a bit of a handbrake slowing them down."
allthingsprotoss,3bzjg3,coldazures,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:02:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah Im not saying cannons alone will beat back a doom drop xD, I just think throughout the game they have different roles against terran drops, but always useful ones. Using them to snipe medivacs while zelots tank is a great way to defend and not take horrible horrible amounts of damage when your in the situation of ""oh shit my deathball is in the middle of the map."" If its a base where they have to fly in like vaani, it is very worth it imo."

IMO the best thing in a pylon block is that it can destoy a zerg build order (yes we have those too :D ) because there are guys who learn the exact time when to take a building - for example 5:50 - instead of the supply.  What i would advice is to always check if there is a drone hiding or not.

I like to block the natural and cancel the pylon at the last second which is when most zergs will just have taken the third. I then try my hardest to cannon rush the third if they don't have vision on it. A second cannon rush can then be started in the natural if they start to consentrate on the 3rd.

allthingsprotoss,3bqzgf,Phybe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:46:06 2015 UTC,I was trying out different ways to defend against this with a friend yesterday and the only time I managed to win was when i went forge first and sent a probe to check behind the rocks at 13 supply. Then you can cannon the hatch but make sure to have the cannons cover all of the rocks so the zerg can't destroy them.

Again, with Moonlight Madness, you can place a pylon on high ground of the opponent's backdoor third and warp in w/o needing to break down the rocks."
allthingsprotoss,3bpwyf,taomcdohl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:19:05 2015 UTC,"idk. I had dash instant veto'ed but when I figured out a much easier way to wall off I unvetoed it and holding judgement since its prolly one of the easier pvt maps of the new ones (baring any gold base or random tank builds that might appear later on).   Moonlight, so far pvz seems doable 3rd more then takeable tho nat to 3rd/4th distance is a pain for dealing with some army movements. But pvt will prolly be hell on that map with airspace wrapping around the whole map. So pvt might earn this map a veto.   Terraform seems generally all right. lots of counter attack routes and proxy pylon spots. Not too vulnerable to drops even tho 3rd is a tad far. Little quick on the rush distance but overall there is nothing on this map that makes it worth a veto.   And then there is bridgehead. No vision through main walloffs makes drops harder to defend, it has a proxy hatch spot, abuse- able cliff over the 3rd, 2 FF wide main ramp, and general back rocks issues. Its reminiscent of expedition lost, and should have the same treatment. Don't veto it if you want to allin on it, since allins on it are quite strong. Prolly deserves a veto otherwise.   this is just my  preliminary outlook on the maps. For sure might change later on."

For a lower level player super detailed scouting isn't really nescessary, you just need to be looking for the major things. When the opponent is expanding, what tech is he going for, where his army is positioned etc., and then respond accordingly.   Just scouting something isn't enough though, you also need to know how to respond to what you scout. I can't go over everything in this post, but watch some pro games and pay close attention to what they do in response to specific things."

allthingsprotoss,3bpfmm,ikmtgv,2,Wed Jul 1 20:48:39 2015 UTC,or they have partinG micro and somehow kill all of your reapers with workers
allthingsprotoss,3bpfmm,rorosama,3,Wed Jul 1 23:34:21 2015 UTC,"Like has been already said, this is a REALLY big question, but I'll try to go over the basics for a probe scout.  Vs toss: you want to 13 scout.  First, have it do a lap around the edge of your main and your natural, this will let you spot any sort of proxy things.  When it gets to your opponent's base, look at his gasses.  If he only has 1 geyser after 18 supply, he's probably going to gateway all in you.  If he has 2 with 2 probes in each after 18 to 20 supply theres a good chance hes going to gateway rush you as well.  Anything else could be some form of tech, try to keep your probe in his main until you see him build a mothership core (you can tell hes making it because the nexus glows extra bright) or a stalker (which is probably the first thing he's going to build from his gateway after the cyber core finishes.  Once you see one of these, run the probe away, but keeping the probe in his base until then forces him to either delay tech or let you scout it.  Obviously if you see him drop tech you should react accordingly.  A final point here is to count his pylons.  If he has too few (say, you're at 17 or 25 supply and you only see 1 or 2 pylons in his base (respectively) and no others building, he's probably trying to proxy tech, either a dark shrine or stargate.  PvZ:  I open nexus first of in this MU, so I scout on 9 to avoid getting shrekt by 10 pools (the probe will get there before the nexus and in time to drop the forge if you pull from the main as your scout arrives), and you should strongly consider doing the same if you want to open forge so you can cannon rush any sort of greed.  The big one here will be his pool timing.  If you sweep his base and you see a pool already down and more than halfway complete, it's probably a 9 or 10 pool. You can hold this with ffe on most maps but it could get close in terms of sealing off in time.  If the pool is about to finish/finished, then its a 6 or 7, and you're gonna need some probe footwork to make this defense.    If there's no pool or it's just going down when you get there it's a normal opener and you can relax for a bit.  After that, try to stick around in his base with the probe for a bit to see if he takes gas.  If he doesn't you're pretty much clear to play however you want,as usually any attacks will require early-ish gas.  If you do see a gas, or just want to play safe, keep an eye on his 3rd.  If theres nothing down by 5 minutes or so, bulk up your defenses a bit (you shouldn't really need to go all out, most toss openers only need slight additional contributions to defense to hold on against most things).  It's important to have a feel for when the lings will pop out based on when he makes the pool, and you want to have your probe be long gone by then, or it will die.  You'll need to get the ability to feel it out through practice.  I'm not really sure what gate openers do about scouting, though most people skip the probe scout due to the gate expo queuing up a zealot that will make deflecting early pools pretty trivial if they show their face.  PvT:  I don't probe scout in this MU because I open in base fast stargate and nothing a terran can open with besides a really committed 2 rax is going to do much against my pair of oracles.  You can sweep your natural for proxy 2 rax, but overall probe scouting will be of little use beyond determining his spawn location, as terrans can and often will wall off the tops of their ramps, and marines or reapers can easily be out in time to deny any real information.  If you decide to poke in with your mothership core (really the only other way to get into his base besides opening stargate), the important thing is to see whether he has 3 rax or a factory.  Factory is almost always a sign of incoming harass, while 3 rax is more defensive.  edit: and yes, this is the BASICS of only early scouting.  Welcome to Starcraft."

But it uses the nexus. and the mineral line is open.   like this http://imgur.com/c1jfo23  because of course the other wall off doesnt actually work for FFE cuz that back pylon just dies.

allthingsprotoss,3bk0bz,TheSkunk_2,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:57:44 2015 UTC,IIRC the 1 rax 1 depot wall can only be done on the low ground of most ramps because you have to wall 2 less squares for some reason. If you do MSC+2 stalker poke against that they're pretty screwed.
allthingsprotoss,3bk0bz,fortunefighting,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:02:16 2015 UTC,But there's no low ground maps where this is possible this season?

allthingsprotoss,3bk0bz,fortunefighting,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:11:28 2015 UTC,But with a depot less to wall it off they dont have to spent the minerals earlier. kind of every build order that is not CC first has you run into a wall (every?) game.  On Vanni they at least have to start the second depot early and you kinda know something fishy might go down.
allthingsprotoss,3bk0bz,fortunefighting,2,Mon Jun 29 22:06:21 2015 UTC,"Ok yeah I get it. It's like Nimbus, but you still want to scout for the off chance they don't wall off and so you can just get information in general. Seeing if they make a reaper or marine first is still extremely valuable information.  Also since there are rocks at the top you can do some early poking like the other person is saying."

allthingsprotoss,3bjm34,DonJimbo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:07:10 2015 UTC,Ive found that you can wall off the front with just one pylon and two 3x3 structures and then place the other pylon near the 2nd open entrance so you can wall it off with one other 3x3. This makes an FFE slightly more reasonable.
allthingsprotoss,3bjm34,Dahktor_P,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:51:08 2015 UTC,It only takes one pylon to wall the back open entrance.
allthingsprotoss,3bjm34,Artikash,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:03:08 2015 UTC,"couple things about that. You don't need the pylon in the front wall, you can do it with just the 2 3x3 structures (and only need 1 pylon for backdoor). And FFE is still NOT reasonable since you have nothing to defend the back door pylon, so simply zerg openings 4 lings will kill it for free. That walloff is fine for gateway expands."

allthingsprotoss,3bjm34,IWatchFatPplSleep,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:49:43 2015 UTC,"it can be blocked with a single pylon but there is also a destructible rock there to make it a 2 pylon gap if destroyed.   bigger issue is the golds.

I haven't played this map so my opinion my vary in the future,  You are right about the gold though, especially since there isn't much space behind the minerals making it easy to wall off.

allthingsprotoss,3bk4iq,Elcactus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:06:20 2015 UTC,Yeah it's just your preference I suppose. I'll have to play a bit on Moonlight to see if it's really that bad since the back door rocks are so far away and have more health.
allthingsprotoss,3bk4iq,Gemini_19,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:07:43 2015 UTC,It is a pretty solid map for PvZ because you can abuse pylons over the rocks and harrass their nat/3rd but PvT. idk how to even play it. No amount of observers can cover all the drop angles to the main
allthingsprotoss,3bk4iq,jamileon,3,Mon Jun 29 22:20:57 2015 UTC,"I've had pretty good success on Moonlight Madness.  The two strats that worked best for me was either taking the forward natural, walling that off completely (gateway, core, pylon) with a cannon or two behind it, then just expanding out the backdoor eventually taking the middleish base as a 4th and parking your army around the middle. Tempests are pretty awesome on this map too, plus the little highground pod between the middle base and the corner base allows collosus a semi safe spot to defend.  I've also had success not even taking the forward natural, just walling off my main ramp, taking the backdoor base as my natural, then the forward middle base as my 3rd. Having the single wide ramp, walled off at your main is really hard for anyone to break into. Can just park 1 or 2 sentries by it and they will never break up that ramp and will be forced to either drop in or go around and attack the ""backdoor"" path which is actually now your main path.  if you take the ""forward nat"" as your 4th it's much easier to defend your 4 bases by planting a few tempests over the deadspace between the middle base & your main.  It's a very interesting design because to me the forward ""natural"" is actually kind of risky and I think it's almost safer to just ignore that base.  So, I suggest either wall off the forward nat completely, making you 100% safe from any early push unless they either break down your wall or kill the back rocks, or wall of your forward natural ramp, place a sentry or two to hold that ramp indefinitely and take the backdoor base as your natural and go from there.  If a player is going to backdoor you, as long as you're quick to lay a forcefield on the ramp you're pretty much safe."
allthingsprotoss,3bk4iq,Rerolled_Tonight,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:09:36 2015 UTC,You've made a strong enough argument that I unveto'd Moonlight Madness to attempt this a few times.
allthingsprotoss,3bk4iq,phantommonster,2,Mon Jul 6 02:53:23 2015 UTC,"the 3rd doesn't seem that bad on that map. PvZ the 3rd is pretty free. Zerg has to break down rocks to get to it, so you shouldn't have an issue getting sim city down before they have a chance to attack it. Then if you have good vision meeting the zerg army at whatever choke they try to go through to get to your base can also be an easier option then defending at the low ground.   PvT seems much harder since rocks delay terran less and there is sooooo much airspace on the map.   on the plus side there are some pretty good proxy pylon spots."
allthingsprotoss,3bk3mb,Joshjayk,3,Mon Jun 29 21:37:52 2015 UTC,"In lower leagues it's perfectly fine and acceptable to scout in every match up and every game at 13 supply after your gateway. You will get to the other base early enough to scout any early cheese to give you enough time to react and it doesn't completely destroy your economy like a 9 scout does.  In PvP it will help to do a little scout around your base and natural before sending it across the map to see any gateways or cannons that are being made near you. Since you'll get to the other base too early to see things that you need to, you can spare the time looking around your side of the map first.  In PvZ if you're doing a FFE (forge fast expand) or Nexus first you can scout on 9 to see if they're going for any super early pools so that you can be extra safe."
allthingsprotoss,3bk3mb,Gemini_19,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:56:15 2015 UTC,"So in general I look for a few things Gas usage Expansions and production or the lack there of. Early against protoss and terran a 13 scout from gateway is standard.  In pvp i scout around my base looking for a 2 gate or a probe who is looking to cannon rush. If I don't find any of these things I end up at their base around the time the cybercore is finishing.   I want to see a couple things. How much gas they have mined, how much chronoboost they have, and how many pylons/gates they have. 2 gas at this point with quite a bit mined likely means Stargate, Blink, or DT's.  They should have 3 pylons. If you don't find all 3 there is a proxy tech or a pylon near your base for a likely warpgate attack.  Saved up chronoboost is most likely for a gateway attack but this almost always occurs with only 1 gas.  Against terran all I need to see is their gas timing. Usually its either none (early expansion, or a ton of marines for early pressure), about 50 mined (probably reaper), or about 100 mined (early factory, could be widowmines, hellions, or banshees. From this mostly I just want to know how quickly I need detection or units.)  Against zerg it depends on what you are doing as far as standard scout timing. Either off gateway or off first pylon in a FFE.  I mostly FFE and my goals are to make sure there isn't an early pool, ie one before I get there. Then if no pool try and block the natural hatch ~2:10. If they don't have a hatch by 2:30 I go look for a pool again. early gas could be speedlings, roaches, or fast lair (usually mutas).  A zerg will most likely have a 3rd hatch between 3 and 6 minutes. If there is not 3rd hatch at 6 minutes add more sentries and cannons as a 2 base all in is likely on the way.  So midgame I would say starts around 5 minutes or so and lasts until around the point where most builds can max out ~14 minutes or so.  What I am looking for now is: Composition Army positioning Expansions  Starcraft is a game of information. If you know exactly what they are doing then all you need to do is prepare a suitable response, whether it be defense or aggression. As a protoss in this part of the game observers and hallucinated phoneixs tell me most of what I need to know. Also I have found it invaluable against terran to have a stalker near the exit to their base to see if they are doing some sort of bio pressure.  As you move into the lategame you should know what their composition is but you also need to know what they may remax on and be ready to handle something like a mass muta switch, roach hydra remax, switch from blink to Zealot/Archon etc.  From http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/2zdzr4/how_to_scout/"

allthingsprotoss,3bbt0r,ZambiesInc,3,Sat Jun 27 18:44:37 2015 UTC,"obviously a standard 14 scv scout is going to help you a lot with scouting. I would recommend scv scouting every game until you get to a level where you feel confident playing without it, which obviously isn't the case for you currently.  I'm not sure how much game knowledge you actually have, so I'll break it down as if you were very new to the game:  when your scv gets into the protoss' base, the first thing you should be checking for is gas & pylon count. The protoss should have 2 pylons and 1 gas, assuming they are playing standard. If this is the case, you don't even have to worry about sending your reaper immediately to the protoss' base, as you really have nothing to be scared of in the immediate future.(unless they went for some sort of 10 gate, in which case you need to bunker up asap homie)  Send your reaper to different spots around the map where probes may be hiding, and you can even furthermore solidify your position in the game. At around the 3:20~ mark, check with your scv if the protoss is making a zealot. If they aren't producing a zealot, try to get down an ebay block if you can, as it's almost certain to put you WAY ahead. (league like diamond and below, ebay blocks are insanely OP, protoss players don't prepare for them, and it's an easy way to quick huge leads from basically nothing) Once you identify your toss opponent is committed towards macro play (they are making a natural) you want to start scouting with your reaper for tech at around ~5 minutes. Poke in with your reaper and try to get information, but try not to lose it. Once it get around 5:30, if you still haven't scouted any tech i suggest suiciding the reaper and even scanning if that doesn't work.   If your opponent has 2 gas (and likely only 1 pylon) by the time your scv scout gets there, you need to start to prepare for some cheesy play. use your reaper to scout around the map, and start an ebay relatively soon to have a turret up by the ~5:10 mark. Even after you've defended the initial oracle, assuming it's an oracle, it's important to get a scout to see whether or not your opponent is transitioning into macro. If you get to their nat with your reaper and still see no nexus, go full defensive-mode. You're likely going to have to lift your natural cc and just defend on 1 base, with a bunker on your main ramp preferably. Assuming your opponent is actually committing on 1 base, and isn't just making some hidden base, getting stim and medivacs out basically means that you just win. So all you have to do is be defensive until that happens. If you've noticed, it's extremely important to continually scout at various key timings within the game, so try not to lose your reaper in these kinds of games.   note that scouting 2 gas doesn't always mean it's going to be some sort of cheese, simply that cheese is far more likely. there's also the fact that players in your league won't always do things that make sense, so always be cautious and not afraid to put down a blind turret or two if you're confused. Even if you waste 200 minerals on turrets, having decent macro and multitask will more than compensate for any small early game disadvantage you find.  So, that covers 3 gate oracle, 5:10 oracle, and fast 1-base dt builds.   When you say ""warp prism dts"" I'm assuming you mean dt builds that come after a standard 1 gas macro opener. Builds that start off with a standard ~5 minute twighlight and 6-6:45 robo, but verge off into dt tech instead of the standard blink. To tell the difference between blink and dt, you need to be watching for a few key things.   1) gateway count. dt builds will generally stay on 1 gate until very late (trap's dt drop build doesn't get gateway 2&3 until the 8 minute mark) If it's past the 6:30 mark and your opponent is still on 1 gate, be suspicious for dts.   2) unit count. obviously, protoss' has to sacrifice their unit count when going for such a tech-heavy play. if you scout the protoss is staying on a especially low unit count, be wary of dts.   3) proxy pylons. again, against standard openers I suggest using your reaper to check for nearby probes looking to make proxy pylons. If your opponent is throwing down proxy pylons, and you're able to scout one with an early reaper/marine, be worried about dts. While dt drop builds obviously don't NEED proxy pylons to get dts into your base, many toss' will warp in the first dt using a proxy pylon, as many builds don't have the warp prism getting to your base until nearly 45 seconds after their dt shrine finishes.  4) twilight chrono. many protoss players going dts will fake-research blink once you get near their council, but if you scout a protoss who opener ~5 council not once his council is completed, it's more often than not dt.  in lower levels, it can be fairly hard to know 100% what the toss is going for, so don't be afraid to start 1-2 blind turrets if you still are uncertain of what the toss is going for. You don't even have to finish them. You can stop building them at 99%, and simply cancel if nothing comes your way. (and obviously finish them if you see dts or oracles)  I'm actually not sure exactly how to scout 2 base colossus allins, but I assume a lack of forges + high gateway count will be an obvious tell. Once you scout it, you can either set up a HUGE concave with mmm in an open area where the toss will be running into, or make like 4 bunkers on your natural ramp and hold while you pump out 2 vikings at a time. which of these 2 options you should choose is probably pretty situation, and I don't think I'm good enough to tell you what to do when.  this was literally just a huge ramble by me, so sorry for that. But I hope some of this can help. If you have any questions, or you feel I didn't really touch upon something you would have liked to know, just comment again clarifying what you'd want to hear."

allthingsprotoss,3bbt0r,MiddlingPenguin,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:10:44 2015 UTC,"let's say you scout that protoss opened council first (council thrown down at around ~5 minutes)   if you scan this protoss at, let's say, 6:30, and he isn't researching blink, then it's probably going to be dts. Otherwise he would have opened council first and literally not used it at all, which makes no sense.   i reread that sentence and it made no sense, sorry.

allthingsprotoss,3bbt0r,Trevorrrr,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:13:30 2015 UTC,"If you just open standard reaper it should be fine for scouting and scans. If you are worried you can send the scv after your rax is done to scout, this helps if they opened say 10 gate so you can get a bunker up."
allthingsprotoss,3bab2l,Oldnewprotoss,3,Sat Jun 27 07:45:56 2015 UTC,"When I play against terran, I will typically scout at 17 on a 2 player map or on 13 on a 4 player map. If I see them beginning to wall off, I hardly ever take my probe inside because (being baddie) I will lose my probe almost all the time because the asshole terran will build his second depot early just to get my probe. And personally I hardly ever get information that makes losing the probe worth it.  So typically I never see inside the base with my probe scout. At this phase, scouting terran is about what you don't see just as much as what you do see. I don't really think seeing the gas is important because since Hots I almost never see terran go gasless expand.   Don't sit your probe outside their base, you want to move in and out so it doesn't get killed when he moves out. You need to check for his expansion. If I don't see a CC up when I check after I put down my Nexus (21) I will assume he's going to be aggressive early on. I will poke up his ramp and try to see what's on his barracks, can I see additional barracks, what units does he have (just marines or are there marauders). If you don't see any units, he's either hiding them or going for something like widow mine drops or something. I usually don't care exactly what he's doing because preparing for one thing at this stage is preparing for most things. I always go early robo in PvT, even if I'm opening templar, because I want observers. If you go later robo, just make sure you build a sentry soon early and you'll have a hallucination around the same time as an obs would be out anyways.  Generally I am playing pretty greedy, depending on my mothership core, unless I don't see an expansion or I see a lot of barracks, units. In that case, I get my 3 gateways earlier than normal and start warping in units beforehand. But there have been many times when I haven't started warping in units until he kills my scouting probe on his way across the map, but with mothership core and a few warp ins I usually survive quite nicely.  Edit: Btw, this advice is for below diamond. If you are above that, then don't listen to me."
allthingsprotoss,3bab2l,WolfBro,3,Sat Jun 27 10:04:17 2015 UTC,I don't really think seeing the gas is important because since Hots I almost never see terran go gasless expand.

allthingsprotoss,3bab2l,burn78,2,Sat Jun 27 18:47:41 2015 UTC,I always scout after cybercore.
allthingsprotoss,3bab2l,Nagromcire,2,Sat Jun 27 15:00:26 2015 UTC,"If you can't get in at least see what's at the wall off around 16-17. If you see an early reactor or tech lab on the barracks walling off a robo is best choice so you can transition into colossi earlier; if you see a factory at the front with a reactor its probably a few hellions into widow mine drops. Also don't forget the power of hallucinated Phoenixes for scouting, they're essentially free if you get an early sentry"
allthingsprotoss,3bab2l,Dangle76,-2,Sat Jun 27 16:07:32 2015 UTC,"What league is this?  If you scout after 9 pylon, his base absolutely should not be walled off (on a 2 player map).

A 9 scout will always get in, right? Scouting on 13 after gateway seems a bit more iffy, as it will arrive when terran has ~18 supply (I think) and that's when they make their second depot.  Then again, terran should put his rax closer to his CC and not use it to wall off anyway."

If they wall off and you don't get into their main just open robo or stargate and assume it's widow mines.  I always open stargate against a wall off when I can't get inside and go into phoenix to harass the medivac and lift the mines.

allthingsprotoss,3atynd,turbodollop,6,Tue Jun 23 15:23:40 2015 UTC,One thing to add. Make sure the zealot or probe that complete the wall are on hold position. Building a wall without holes  take practice. I have played over 1000 games and occasionally  I still make holey walls when i rush them. It happens don't let it ruin game
allthingsprotoss,3atynd,taomcdohl,3,Tue Jun 23 17:35:27 2015 UTC,"This is a prime example of ""play with accuracy, not speed.""  People who rush their gameplay with the mindset of ""I have to play fast to get better"" often make repeated mechanical mistakes such as this."
allthingsprotoss,3atynd,turbodollop,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:02:24 2015 UTC,Playing too fast is definitely  not my problem. I play with a wicked fast 45-55 amp. I just don't play enough to know the right way to wall off all the maps.   I will think it's a wall and have a hex  open somewhere on the side. When I was playing every day this happened  way less. I am lucky to get a ladder session in every other week these days.

allthingsprotoss,3atynd,Ozy-dead,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:33:24 2015 UTC,"Anticipate putting down buildings.  Move your probe prior to getting 150 minerals so that the moment you have 150 minerals, your probe is starting the gateway.  You can move the probe when you have something like 110 minerals or so.   You KNOW he's 6-pooling you.  Save some chronoboosts for the zealots. The forge was pointless.  It was a waste of minerals when you needed zealots.  You were supply blocked as well.  That forge needed to be a second pylon.  You also don't need the second gateway, it can be a cybernetics core.  Just pull probes when he shows up.  If you get a good surround on the zerglings, he's done. In this scenario, don't take gas if you aren't going to make a cybernetics core.   As I said previously, PULL YOUR PROBES to defend.     You should've seen that your zealot never built because of a supply block, your gas was entirely wasted, and you freely allowed him to tear down your gateways.  He is severely damaging his economy in order to attack you early.  You need to defend with probes and your zealots to kill the early zerglings.  Once you do, you'll have a massive lead on him and he'll be unable to come back."

Place gateway/cyber at the ramp, but leave one pixel open (set the option to show build grid on, it really helps a lot). If you see a completed pool and some early lings, then chrono out a zealot and place it on 'hold' in the small opening. Your build order should be:   9 Pylon 13 Gateway 15 Double Assimilator 17 Pylon 18 Cybercore   If you think that he will keep building and sending lings, build a sentry or two to forcefield his lings, trying to trap a few within range of your zealot.

Confirm very early pool.  14 Forge behind mineral line -- make a cannon in your mineral line but slightly to one side to protect a gas geyser.  . . . When the lings come, make your probes surround your cannon by right clicking on it. Then press H to hold position. Keep making probes. Go back to work as soon as possible.  . . . Make a gas geyser and gateway within range of the cannon as soon as you can. Chrono out units.   A If he keeps coming on one base, add two more gateways and a mothership core, secure your second gas, and wall at the top of your main ramp. Expand to your natural as soon as you have a few warp ins and can deal with the lings. Zealot sentry is very good if you can use forcefields to prevent full surrounds.  or . . .  B If he backs off, expand and add two more gateways and a cannon at the natural choke. Make sure lings can't get in.  Note: When you get better, just make the 9 pylon and 14 forge at the natural choke. You would lose them if he rushed, but you would make a pylon and cannon in your mineral line before the forge went down. I'm just giving you a more defensive option to hard counter your cheesey friend. If he doesn't rush, then the cannon and your buildings make a wall at your natural.  http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/sc2-strategy/383628-protoss-versus-zerg-the-guide#1.1.2"

allthingsprotoss,3arm1b,snatchblastersteve,2,Mon Jun 22 23:10:47 2015 UTC,"I think the game1 wall was because he was afraid of hellions -- you'll notice Dream has roughly the same build every other game, and hellions are a part of it. He likely metagamed him (given they're teammates), and Merry Go Round is cancer vs T very difficult to get a wall up in time for hellions, so I think that was the point to that!  I don't actually think he was ahead g1; he did a good job of surviving. I think Dream signed his death warrant by not bothering to have SCVs repairing; otherwise it might have been close and the blink stalkers might have been able to claw Classic back into the game  G2 I think Classic was actually miles ahead, and then he donated all the collosus he owned? I feel like he crumbled in that game, which is unfortunate because it was also pretty dominant given that Dream is such a macro monster.  I think one of the cooler points to this series is that it turns out stargate openings vs T mightn't be as shit as everyone knows they are -- they've been a hallmark of Classic's play for a little while, and he usually always manages to eek out damage here or there with an oracle. I guess if you're a literal god that's unsurprising, but it's good to know that it's not an all-or-nothing tech path vT like it so often appears on ladder."
allthingsprotoss,3arm1b,bgbnbigben,2,Tue Jun 23 01:10:21 2015 UTC,eh I think you underestimated the effect of the double upgrade snipe in game 2. The instant that happened any type of lead classic might of had was gone. He didn't crumble as I don't think his last army split was bad or his micro was bad he just lost because split up bio with better upgrades is silly efficient.
allthingsprotoss,3arm1b,willdrum4food27,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:44:56 2015 UTC,"yes game 1 was definitely anti hellion wall, if you watch Dream vs herO, Dream went hellion every fucking game, and did so much damage. Classic definitely studiet the series and build his game plan accordingly."
allthingsprotoss,3aoxsm,dekrumel,3,Mon Jun 22 08:51:37 2015 UTC,"I only played ~50 games so far, it's not enough to be sure, but here is what I do:   PvZ: 13 pylon, forge, nexus. Attempt cannon rush, if failed - get +1 4 gate prism drops with a 3rd behind it, drops a mix of adepts and zealots. Put down 2-3 stargates, get 5-6 oracles, go fuck shit up, get carriers behind it. Plant a lot of stasis mines around ur bases.   PvT: 2-gate expansion into TC. I tried disruptors, didn't work, so I'm doing HT-archon-chargelot mix with heavy prism play. Storm drops, zealot bombs, etc..Lategame, I add 8-10 adepts to the mix to help soak up damage. So far, PvT sucks because cyclones are OP as fuck. Terran just sets up 4-5 clones below your natural, then pokes in with medivacs/rax/anything flying, and snipes a unit or two. I've been partially successfull by positioning archons to soak up auto-targeting, and storming/feedbacking w/e I see, but it doesn't work very well. But prisms are great for breaking the contain (warp chargelots behind enemy lines, do 2-prong attack and sandwitch T army).

With collosus being heavily nerfed, we really have no way of dealing with this kiting. Sure blink stalkers will counter cyclones outright but once the clones are mixed in with the army, its a PITA. Disruptors are shit as bio can kite back fairly easily and then snipe it once it fails to kill them. Disruptor drops are alright but...storm drops do it just as well and can be used in an army.  I've considered trying to go for carriers but I feel like that AOE air unit would destroy ceptors in the late game and honestly, a mid-game bio push would probably destroy me before I had enough carriers out."

Some common follow ups are      Robo->3 gates -> Robo bay/warp prism -> disruptor drop while taking a third or starting 1/1. Stargate (or proxy Stargate) -> oracle-> twilight/blink pressure (although this is mainly for PvP 3 gate or 4 gate adept/gateway pressure while teaching Twilight and double forge -> blink->zealot charge while defending with oracles/stalkers and taking a fast third vs T (make sure to drop down a Robo if he begins widow mine production 3 gates + fast third (honestly this is a risk and you should only do it on big maps, or have amazing scouting) you can go into anything from here but my favorite is a gateway/disruptor/warp prism army.       If you have questions about build specifics or want to practice on LotV PM me."
allthingsprotoss,3aoxsm,NaNiWuT,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:12:12 2015 UTC,"I have around 180ish toss games in LotV but I have a somewhat non-aggressive play-style that isn't working amazingly in LotV.  PvZ- I open 17 or 18 nexus first every game. I lost a single game to a zerg who went pool first and flooded lings but I think the benefit outways the risks. There's pretty much zero reason not to go hatch first as zerg right now. I play heavy adept stalker in the midgame transitioning into storm or disruptor drops if I have to. However if the game gets to the point where the zergs economy is good and you don't have a big ass army to stop the lurkers from moving out into aggressive positions your probably dead. Lurkers are stupid good and you need to design builds around killing the Zerg or crippling them before they can build significant numbers of them. I've had pretty much zero luck with skytoss builds with how powerful lategame zerg is. (Havn't played a ton with viper ""murder air button"" costing 125 mana now though). Trying to mass carriers usually leads me to getting dropped and hurassed over and over while they build up lurker hydra viper ultra which pretty much steamrolls anything but the most stupid expensive toss armies.   Oh yeah and the drop coming early leads to some extremely annoying pressure if the zerg knows what they are doing. No idea what the counter is yet but to keep all my units randomly sitting in my main. It makes holding a third even more difficult because there will commonly be 3 sided attacks into all your bases now with roachs, lings, and (god help you) lurkers.   PvT: I open 17 nexus first every game because I'm confident against reapers pre-core and stalker/adept not doing any damage. I then tend to go stargate with an oracle first if I think I can do damage otherwise I'll build around 4 phoenix to defend and to pressure the terran while teching to adept shiels+ blink+ storm.   PvP- I've always hated PvP and PvP is the whole reason I played mainly Zerg in Hots. It's just as shitty as ever as 90% of the games break down to either blink stalker wars or mass adept battles. I havn't won a single game where I tried to expand. Holding a ramp from 10 adepts isn't possible and they just end up slaughtering your mineral line if you try and kite them with stalkers. The only thing I've beat mass adepts with is blink stalkers where I was the aggressor. Understandably I am a somewhat weak PvP player compared to my ability in other matchups but it seems like a one base all in fest right now."

allthingsprotoss,3akjj6,Gemini_19,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:59:37 2015 UTC,"well my logic says that he spends 400 on nexsus cannon in your main, so you are free to invest in natural and stay safe as you have same amount of resources to use on defense, add to that defenders advantage and you are sure to hold. If he expands himself it will be later then your expand, and he will waste 400 minerals on proxy nexsus, which will allow you to pressure his expand. At least that what my theory crafting says to me."
allthingsprotoss,3akjj6,somerandomtoss,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:51:51 2015 UTC,"The thing with expanding yourself is that I don't think your natural will finish in time for his attack so you can overcharge. Even if you do you're also defending a much harder area (your natural) so you don't have the advantage of a small ramp.  Sure your natural might be quicker than his if you expand and he decides to as well, but he's still going to be on 2 bases while you aren't because you just lost your main to a proxy nexus. So in the long run he's still going to be ahead.  The 400 minerals definitely puts you behind, but not so much so that you just literally can't do anything anytime soon after it happens.  There's also the chance he notices you expand, notices that that means your defenses will be late, and just cancels the nexus and 4gates your defenseless base as well."
allthingsprotoss,3akjj6,Gemini_19,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:32:52 2015 UTC,"The idea is that even though you're expanding, you're getting your overcharge before he is getting his. He would probably just kill all kinds of pylons and follow up with some sort of voidray allin to win though."

allthingsprotoss,3akjj6,somerandomtoss,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:48:52 2015 UTC,No because the follow up is a 4 gate almost always. The best thing to do i think is to do a 4 gate attack yourself

allthingsprotoss,3ac2zn,estebomb,2,Thu Jun 18 21:59:27 2015 UTC,It's very likely that the way you're executing the attack isn't the problem. An attack like that can work fine in low leagues just by doing it right and simply having more stuff.  So if you could show a replay that would be great because we can't exactly see what you're doing wrong.

allthingsprotoss,3ac2zn,PulseReaction,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:42:14 2015 UTC,"For PvT try a 1 Gate FE into robo. It's safe as hell against pretty much anything a terran will be doing in the early game as long as your macro is decent. If you scout he hasnt taken a natural of his own put down another 2 gates right after the robo, and get obs and immortals. If he does a fast expand of his own get observers, blink and colossus.   For PvZ try out a forge fast expand into a sentry-immortal all in. It's an older build so you don't see it much in pro-games anymore, but I think its a good build to practice your Force-fields and army positioning as well as macroing on two bases. Basically just macro up until you have 2 base saturation, 3 immortals, and a bunch of sentries and zealots. Attack your opponent's third and try to keep his units from attacking your immortals by using forcefields.  These are really rough guides but I didn't want to overwhelm you with a fully detailed build order. If you want to look at a complete build order check out the ""Build of the Week"" archive on the side bar."

allthingsprotoss,3ac2zn,Emyndri,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:13:40 2015 UTC,In PVZ a gateway expand is gateway > Nexus > 2x gas> Cyber   eh I still think of cyber before nexus when you say gate expand in pvz (which is more then viable).

It's safe, with the oracle, offering early harass and scouting (don't lose the oracle!)  From there, you transition into a +2 blink.    The DT play is fun, but it's so highly dependent upon a lot of factors to go right.  Make sure it isn't scouted, get the DTs warped in a timely fashion, do actual damage with the DTs, etc.  Obviously, the usual stuff comes into play: Don't get supply blocked, stay on top of probe production, don't delay the build itself."

allthingsprotoss,3a9fcl,drock_davis,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"I can't look at your replays right now as i'm at work, but it sounds like you have a basic general problem of letting the zerg expand too much, since those two units are extremely gas intensive.  Also, the reverse switch is even harder to deal with at higher skill levels.  In general, the way this game is designed if both races have no pressure zerg will win every time.  So, the question is are you putting adequate pressure on the zerg at the appropriate times?  Scouting and contesting his expansions?  As a protoss you should always be able to know what the zerg is building and also force him to do certain things.  For example, if he's going hydras, are you making him buy roaches or are you letting him go slowling->hyrdas?  Even speedling hydra can be punished super hard by +1 protoss.  For me personally, I don't like all in builds like +2 blink stalker because it is so all or nothing, and better players will scout you.  It's a decent pocket build but not a go to.  My favorite build is the old school san 4gate expand.  It's scoutable but there's a ton of flexibility to it.  Also, if you have problems with hydras early, you also sound like you need to deny creep, which is related to your lack of pressuring.  masters since wol season 1"
allthingsprotoss,3a9fcl,GraVesc2,0,Fri Jun 19 21:31:39 2015 UTC,"Ok so I've watched  your replay and one thing I've noticed is that you have not enough sentry's for your composition. Your opening was kinda hit or miss so the game is not the best example but if you want to open gate expand into +2 blink stalker you want to have around 10 sentry's. Also I suggest to split your 3 dts into 3 bases rather than go for a hatch. Next thing is that i don't really like scouting on 9 with gate expand. Your opening should defend everything without scouting with good reaction. Worst thing would be 14/14 but you can scout later for that. Another thing, when you get robo try chronoing your obs and sent it to your opponent's main rather than keeping it with your army. You don't clear tumors and your obs could check for hive and what units spawn. Because of low sentry/obs you have not enough information. The biggest thing dealing with hydra into muta is information. Try making more sentry and send hallu right when you see him attack. It will tell you what kind of tech he has behind. Hope i help with my little rant :P good luck! First comment on reddit for first ever post so be kind :D"
allthingsprotoss,3a7spn,kirisakichann,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:12:52 2015 UTC,"For starters, scout on 13, inside your base and proxy locations, and check their gas and chrono boosts.  One gas, saved chronoboosts means a 4-gate or something similar.  Check the timing on the gateway itself.  Just use your own gateway as a gauge.  Is his way ahead of yours?  Probably a 10-gate. You can sometimes slip your probe into their base (you may laugh), and see what his tech choice is before his stalker comes out.    What build are you favoring right now that is getting you beat?"
allthingsprotoss,3a7spn,taomcdohl,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:22:40 2015 UTC,"i do a one gate expand with a fast robo. I'll havent been looking at chrono boosts, good idea."

The moment any Protoss sees the level of greed you're going for, they're going to just throw down gates and all-in you.   You can't 1-gate FE in PvP.  The only way you get away with something like that is if the other person decides not to scout.

allthingsprotoss,3a7spn,Gemini_19,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:35:01 2015 UTC,I'd suggest this instead. It's similar to the build he's used to already but a much safer version of it that really just doesn't lose to any form of early all ins.
allthingsprotoss,3a7spn,vhapteR,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:57:46 2015 UTC,Yeah this build is giving me a lot of success today
allthingsprotoss,3a7spn,Gemini_19,0,Thu Jun 18 19:53:31 2015 UTC,"Of course you can. Top pros have done this countless times.   It's not a build I'd do against a straight up 3-4 gate all in with 4 chronos on warp gate, but you can easily rule that stuff out by scouting if you're worried.   This is basically the way tech paths work in PvP: you can go twilight (blink or dt), robo, and stargate. Those who want to go robo either expand or get it behind some sort of gateway pressure, since 1 base robo isn't even a thing.  Robo expands can definitely do well against blink if you know how to defend properly. I'm just a top diamond player, yet I've managed to get a substantial lead against a 4 or 5 time gm player in practice once in this situation because I improved my defense considerably after we played 1-2 practice games. If I'd made better decisions in the mid game, I definitely could have beaten him."
allthingsprotoss,3a7spn,vhapteR,3,Thu Jun 18 00:13:43 2015 UTC,"Of course you can. Top pros have done this countless times.   Doesn't mean your average plat player can. Tao is right in that the build isn't exactly the most ladder friendly build, especially in lower leagues where a lot of that build working is dependent on scouting and extremely tight timings."
allthingsprotoss,3a7spn,Gemini_19,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:51:29 2015 UTC,"Gemini, he isn't right. In fact, what he said is clearly untrue:   You can't 1-gate FE in PvP.   He never said the build just isn't ladder friendly. He said you can't do it. Maybe you don't have faith in the skill level of our little plat buddy, but there's simply no reason for him to write off the build altogether.   What if he gets promoted soon? Is it still a good idea for him to have this close-minded view of the matchup?    Perhaps all he needs is some practice and good tips? This build can most definitely work in diamond league, so I don't think it's too far off for a platinum player to work on it. It may be map dependent, but that's something else entirely. In fact, a lot of PvP builds are pretty similar in this regard.  Simply put, you get a solid edge against DTs, may be able to get an edge against blink depending on the map and your skill, probably will have trouble against a stargate opener, and should avoid doing it against gateway all ins. That's PvP - sometimes you get an edge, sometimes you're behind.  What I can't possibly understand is how I deserve to get downvoted for helping the OP. How am I not contributing to the discussion when I was trying clear up a misconception that's even likely to confuse him once he gets promoted? Sigh..."
allthingsprotoss,3a7spn,vhapteR,2,Thu Jun 18 02:25:34 2015 UTC,"I might have just misunderstood Tao since, as you said, of course you CAN 1 gate FE in PvP. I was more clearing up what he might have been intending with less words.  Also my main goal when I help people or give coaching is always based on the long term, so I understand what you mean with the ""what if he gets promoted soon"" logic. However, in this case I don't feel this is entirely applicable. PvP is such a wide open and versatile match up, so there's no harm in trying other styles and builds. The build that I suggested a little farther up is extremely similar to a 1 gate FE, except that it's much safer and more reliable. I use it all the time in my games so it's not like that will hinder his ability to play the game in the long term, I'm just giving him another way to get to the same spot basically.  Also perhaps the people who downvoted you did so because of your ending comment about the GM. A lot of people don't like the ""oh I COULD have beat this super great player if only I did X and Y"" mentality so they might have just taken you the wrong way."
allthingsprotoss,3a7spn,Emyndri,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:41:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not talking about the build you suggested - trying a few different PvP builds is certainly a good idea.   Personally, I've never liked the 2 gate expand much because you get a delayed robo (not ideal against blink) and a few too many units with a later nexus. However, it's a great suggestion since itis an overall more adaptable build. You can even cancel your nexus depending on what you're up against. Definitely worth trying.  I see what you mean about the GM comment. Maybe people think that just because I'm in diamond? That's a pity. I just wanted to make it clear that my opinion - that this build isn't something to write off completely - isn't mere theorycrafting. I thought this discrepancy between our skill level could be encouraging for a plat player who wants to beat diamond players with this build and those who think it isn't viable anymore. Oh, well.   By the way, thanks for understanding. I feel a lot of people disregard long term improvement. As a guy who played wc3 for years back in the days, I know how important it was to practice good strategies even if you couldn't ""micro like X or Y"". After all, you can't develop skill without practice."
allthingsprotoss,3a7spn,vhapteR,2,Thu Jun 18 03:28:27 2015 UTC,"It gets pretty hard to hold off stargate allins with a 1gate expand. You also have pretty disastrous results if you don't scout a 4gate or proxy stargate in time.   Blink allins are possible to defend, but hard.   I think 1g expo can be a viable build but it's hard to do."
allthingsprotoss,3a7spn,taomcdohl,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:44:39 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of people say they believe blink vs 1 gate FE to be even. Personally, I find it difficult to trade against an expanding player efficiently.   Maybe it's just me, or perhaps people are being too greedy with their 1 gate FE and don't even cut probes to build their robo and gates asap - I've actually seen that a lot -, but defending is so much easier breaking an expanding player with blink.   Naniwa's 1 gate expand was really good against blink because he'd get his robo at 5:00-5:15... can't recall the exact timing, but you could definitely get a decent number of immortals out. Of course this is very map dependent, so on certain maps blink can be very deadly.  Stargate all ins can be very deadly, so there's not much to say. Unless you scout it and adapt your build, it's like a build order loss.   Dedicated gateway all ins (4 chronos on wg) shouldn't be a concern unless you're playing on a 4 player map. These strategies are pretty blatant, so the only thing that could possibly catch you offguard if you're not careful is a fake gateway all in into a quick nexus. I'll admit scouting does weaken the build quite a bit though, but scouting a 4 gate is easy.  On 4 player maps, even regular builds can get you in trouble if you scout a gateway all in too late. For instance, you don't want to be up against that sort of build if you're teching to blink, unless you're doing a safe 3-5 stalker rush before starting your twilight council.  This reminds me of Harstem. He said he went 1 gate expand on Deadwing once in a tournament when it was a 4p map. He was trying to do it in a way that a 10 gate wouldn't be so much of a problem, but if you can't scout the other player right away, it's still pretty tricky. But he was up against this no name guy who went fucking nexus first into gateway + forge and by the time he scouted him, he was even getting a forge upgrade (lol). So yeah, 4 player maps are stupid in PvP. :(  It's also very important to keep in mind that sc2 isn't only about playing on the ladder. In fact, I find it much more fun to play custom games since you can play the player and not just the matchup. That opens up a lot of possibilities, which are huge in a matchup like PvP."
allthingsprotoss,3a7spn,BringTheNewAge,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:05:52 2015 UTC,You get the award for being Mr. Literal.  :D  I literally just played a 1 gate FE.  Guess what?  Smashed it with a DT opener into a stalker/archon push to mop him up.  Pros pull it off with crisp execution and meta-gaming combined with maps.  Can you do it?  Sure.  But I wouldn't do it on ladder.
allthingsprotoss,3a7spn,paksat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:09:02 2015 UTC,thats whats getting you killed i would say 90%+ of my pvp games never go beyond one base for either player it is a very all in match up when you have to have very good scouting and control if you want to survive past the 6 min mark after taking a natural
allthingsprotoss,3a8c7p,SpiritSTR,3,Thu Jun 18 00:53:29 2015 UTC,"you execute your buildorder a little weird. When you have 6 probes at your natural you should cut all probe production to get 2x gates and the robo THEN resume chronoboosted probe production again.  Analyzing this replay isn't really rocket science. You lose your mothership core at his first push for no reason at all, then you completely forget to make probes.  You push out with stalkers without blink (never do that in the mid-late game) and lose two of them for the exact reason you shouldn't push out with non-blink stalkers. Then you don't have PO for his second push because you lost your mothership core earlier.  You get your robobay way too late for the opening Terran went for. If he opens with rax instead of factory you need the robobay around 8:00-8:20, for comparison, you took yours at 9:20.  Personally I like to play this exact buildorder by pushing out and being aggressive with the stalkers (with a reinforcement pylon). Usually if my opponent opened factory or is going into mech I can just kill them right there with blinking into their base or get enough dmg done while taking a third and macroing up at home (and that is EU high master/GM opponents)."
allthingsprotoss,3a6xl2,KrisitownGaming,2,Wed Jun 17 18:31:43 2015 UTC,When you're saying Mutas you mean Roaches right?
allthingsprotoss,3a6xl2,HanddesWaldes,2,Wed Jun 17 21:37:47 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, so much fail in this video.  First off, it's roaches, not mutas.  Those bat thingies? THOSE are Mutalisks (mutas).  Your wall had several holes in it.  You're lucky zerg didn't try a big ling run-by because you would have been overwhelmed and died.  You only need 3 workers per gas. Etc.  Your very first building after nexus was a forge, yet you didn't do a single upgrade!  Upgrades are crucial to this game.  When playing vs zerg you should, at minimum, start attack 1, even getting attack 2 before your first engagement.  Next up, you made ALL THE THINGS.  You made a robotics facility then only made a warp prism from it.  Don't do that; it wastes resources and makes your army weaker.  You should have at least made a couple observers to give you better map vision.  The key to this game is gathering and using your resources efficiently.  You should scout what army your enemy is making and make the proper units to counter.  You made a DT shrine right at the front of your base which is easily spotted by a scouting overlord, which means he can counter it simply by getting observation.  By the way, the zerg spore colony is a detector.  If you had killed that with your DTs first, that attack might have done much more damage, maybe won the game.  So, what did you do right? Aggressive expansion vs zerg is great, but you need base defenses at your 3rd.  You made a lot of gateways, which is good, but many of them were powered by just one or two pylons which can be easily killed and stop your production.  Probably the best thing you did was scout zergs base a lot to see what's up.  Not being rude but I'm honestly surprised you're in silver league.  You won because that zerg was just a little worse than you.  Keep practicing and watch replays of games you lose to see where you need improvement."

The last thing I want to do is discourage someone from playing my long-time favorite game.  We all started from somewhere and most of us sucked.  The only way to improve is play and lose a lot of games to see how to improve.  Remembering the names of units is not nearly as important as understanding what enemy units do and what you can make to counter it.  One last tip, in the vid you chose voidrays to counter roaches.  While this does work because roaches can't shoot up, roaches are super tanky and can take a lot of damage.  Zerg can also flood roaches much faster than you can make voids.  So, what can happen is zerg will destroy your base while your hand full of voids only kill a hand full of roaches.  Zealots, sentries and immortals are far more effective at killing herds of roaches early.  Search around for a build called the ""Soul Train,"" or an immortal sentry all-in.  Check out the builds and info on the right panel here.  Also check out Imba Builds.  Best of luck to you brotoss!"

If you chronoboost warpgate like twice with 3 gate robo you should have about 5 stalkers a sentry and an obs or 2 as it hits and an overcharge and it should be an easy enough hold (I usually rally both my nexus to my main vs gas first shit until I know whats up)."

allthingsprotoss,39y5j4,NorthernSpectre,3,Mon Jun 15 19:18:01 2015 UTC,This has been the most standard and stable PvT opener for months now. You can add a DT shrine and warp prism near when blink is finishing as well for some extra fun harassment spice as well.
allthingsprotoss,39y5j4,Gemini_19,2,Mon Jun 15 19:54:21 2015 UTC,"All of those builds work if you are scouting and doing them properly. Robo uses vision and map awareness to get better army splits to hold drops. blink uses more map presence to be able to cut some corners at home to get the army you need (also lets you spring back against aggressive factory shit). if you are doing a non-cheesey version of stargate turrets aren't the end all to stargate builds (1 turret does not cover the entire mineral line so with some hold position micro you can still harass, also scvs that are building things are always good targets) and envision lets you dealy/cut obs to catch back up as long as you don't lose the oracle (don't). And I don't know of a build that goes double forge before a scout.  so step 1 is pick a single build for now. don't blame the build blame everything else. When you watch your replays think of what you can do better in the scope of the build you choose (if you need a crisp build order check out the build order archive in the sidebar) before you start trying to look for different strategies."
allthingsprotoss,39y5j4,willdrum4food27,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:03:08 2015 UTC,"i would stick to going robo its probably still the safest because you got vision against widow mines.   and always put some stalkers at your main to counter drops, and place your mothership in between the two nexus to use photon overcharge."
allthingsprotoss,39y5j4,capbarg,0,Tue Jun 16 12:31:38 2015 UTC,"I like to go 11-gate, 3 stalkers into Blink into Robo.  It gives you the ability to shut down the reaper, pressure early, gives you a nice collection of units in the early game (you're not just relying on PO).    It's not exactly what Rotterdam does, but if you've ever watched his stream, it's similar to that."

allthingsprotoss,39xtgp,paksat,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:13:55 2015 UTC,"what i do is 3 gate robo and have 4 stalkers with an obs above it to deal with the hellions if they do a run by ill overcharge where he drops  if it's just a mine drop, then simply overcharge and target fire the medivac while using the stalkers to kill the mines  as for phoenix collosus, idk how you guys do it.. i always die if the terran is even somewhat active rather than sitting around waiting for his 2 medis to pop in the midgame"
allthingsprotoss,39xtgp,jamileon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:10:49 2015 UTC,"Phoenix collo is actually disgustingly safe in the current meta for PvT. You would defend those 3rax stim timings or early concussive timings the same way you would if u were doing an oracle. Just have two stalkers and a sentry, overcharge the nat, and FF the ramp to main. After the overcharge runs out you should have ~4 or 5 phoenix and that is more then enough to deter any additional aggression until medivacs."
allthingsprotoss,39xtgp,paksat,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:40:50 2015 UTC,"also, 3 g robo > twlight > dt shrine i think can be really really good vs this crap  chrono out a prism after your first 2 obs  1 obs to his main and 1 over your stalkers at all times, just how i do it personally"
allthingsprotoss,39ww8g,avengaar,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:43:02 2015 UTC,I just do a 2 gate robo expand and then i can hold just about all blink pressure/all ins. Immortals with a bit of support destroy stalkers. Just micro to keep them alive. DT Robo would be a good build i think since you hate blink vs blink and robo play. Most blink builds dont have detection in time for the early Dt's and even if they do you can keep them in their base while you crank out immortals. Dt robo also allows you to get a faster Nexus than a blink build.
allthingsprotoss,39ww8g,incens,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:50:05 2015 UTC,I always lose in the game of where are the stalkers going to hit next (main or natural.) Is it worth building any sentries or are you pretty much building stalker immortal with a few zealots?
allthingsprotoss,39ww8g,Gemini_19,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:54:29 2015 UTC,You should always have 1-3 sentries in PvP macro games for hallucination scouts and FF/guardian shield. Once you're on 2 bases you should have enough immortals where you can split your army up to the 2 spots where they're going to possible blink up and you should be fine.
allthingsprotoss,39ww8g,willdrum4food27,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:04:14 2015 UTC,"eh. 2 gate robo gets you a slower expo and BEST case you will be even with the blink player unless they are allin-ing (which they shouldn't be if they see no expo and should just put a contain with a couple sentries and expand). DT robo is a bad match for blink robo. DTs do no dmg and you can be punished if you try to take a faster expo behind the zero dmg dts, so your expo will most likely be later then his.  fast expand imo is the best option vs blink (obviously weaker vs stargate).   stargate builds aren't auto lose but you should be able to hold most blink pressure as long as it isn't gateway aggression first, but you expo will most likely be later and it will be challenging to get counter dmg done. Unlinke what vpercevic said, you want a robo with the stargate before expo, like this http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/2xraon/build_of_the_week_pvp_sos_phoenix_into_robo/  /u/avengaar"
allthingsprotoss,39ww8g,vpercevic,0,Mon Jun 15 20:24:03 2015 UTC,"You could go stargate and throw a few Phoenixs in the mix, stop the mothership from allowing vision then grab a couple of stalkers before they blink away"
allthingsprotoss,39ww8g,vpercevic,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:02:35 2015 UTC,With or without a robo? Pretty sure I would just die to the stalkers if I'm trying to build immortals and phoenix.

allthingsprotoss,39vvfe,GreedoShotKennedy,2,Mon Jun 15 15:30:44 2015 UTC,How did no one mention disruptor? 2 kill all lurkers in range and can be picked up into a warp prism after.   If they bunch up too much disruptors can wreck them and if the lurkers are spread out too much they are a lot easier to just pick off with anything ranged. Particularly blink stalkers which are a mainstay.
allthingsprotoss,39vvfe,AnthroGame,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:59:41 2015 UTC,Basically never let them get in a position you have to attack into. They are near unbeatable in high numbers on the ground. Force them to re-position or lose your whole army in 2 volleys.

allthingsprotoss,39vvfe,incens,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:50:28 2015 UTC,"Any splash will do; burrowed lurkers are immobile and make for easy targets. You can thin their numbers quite a bit before you actually engage them, just remember to spread your army when you finally do."
allthingsprotoss,39vvfe,norush_,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:02:33 2015 UTC,"Disruptor drops and out maneuvering are my main defenses. They take time to burrow, so if you can catch them in the middle of the map, you can take much better fights. You can also use disruptors and a warp prism, but you have to pick them up after every attack"
allthingsprotoss,39vvfe,MiTEnder,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:30:00 2015 UTC,"So it depends on the composition you're up against. Opening blink in LotV in PvZ is very solid.  Blink will wreck roach/ravager.  With that said, I've beaten lurkers with stalkers + obs.  You can do a blink stalker push and likely hit just before lurkers are a threat.  If they cut units to rush to lurkers, blink is a great way to mitigate the effects of lurkers.  If they have a ton of lurkers, they sacrificed their hydra/roach/ravager count.  Don't allow your stalkers (or any unit) to clump up.   If you're on top of your micro, you can dodge the lurker attacks entirely.  If you've scouted lurkers early, a disrupter will do wonders.  You don't even need to necessarily hit the lurkers with the disrupter, so long as you take out the roach/hydra units.  With those units dead, the lurkers aren't any trouble."

allthingsprotoss,39vvfe,avengaar,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:45:12 2015 UTC,Depends in the numbers
allthingsprotoss,39vvfe,-Yngin-,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:33:22 2015 UTC,How do you know how many they have until your already in to deep? Flying obs to close pretty much just gets them killed.

allthingsprotoss,39ud20,Biscuit85,3,Sun Jun 14 21:18:45 2015 UTC,"You scout their main, see nothing, look around for proxies, see this"
allthingsprotoss,39ud20,Artikash,3,Sun Jun 14 21:38:15 2015 UTC,And by nothing he means a lack of a 2nd or 3rd pylon (Depending on how early you scout him) nothing being researched on cyber/nothing being built from the gateway.
allthingsprotoss,39ud20,Gemini_19,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:51:38 2015 UTC,I usually scout on 9th. Thanks for the tip. What do I do if i know he is proxying it's either DT's or proxy stargate. Do I expand and do  mass blink stalkers or build a stargate and make phoenixes?
allthingsprotoss,39ud20,Gemini_19,4,Sun Jun 14 22:00:40 2015 UTC,"9 scout in PvP isn't really necessary and it's hurting your economy a lot. A gateway scout will get you all the info you need without completely destroying your economy.  Proxy oracle is the most common so going stargate into phoenix is great, but it depends on your opener and if you can scout what the proxy actually is in time.   Just getting some stalkers and sending the MSCore back after doing a check around your bases and proxy spots for overcharge and you'll be fine. If you can't find the proxy then you'll need a robo quickly."
allthingsprotoss,39ud20,MontyZ253,2,Sun Jun 14 22:36:33 2015 UTC,"Didnt watch the replay, but the number of pylons you can see in your opponents base while scouting is a good indicator.  Typically pylon number 3 you wanna look out for.  No 3rd pylon in his main when there should be? hes proxying something."
allthingsprotoss,39ud20,KOUJIROFRAU,2,Sun Jun 14 21:40:04 2015 UTC,"Can't watch replay right now, but here's how to scout.   Scout the opponent's main after gateway. 2 gases, 1 pylon and cyber being warped in/complete = proxy stargate. Prepare to defend from oracle at home. Scout the map, find the stargate, see what's being produced out of it. Sometimes players might proxy their 3rd pylon rather than their second in a more economic opening that delays the oracle but allows for a more aggressive followup. For this kind of opening you need to scout their main thoroughly after cyber completes to confirm their tech choice. If you don't see one, start looking for proxies and ensure you have access to detection tech appropriate to your build"
allthingsprotoss,39ud20,Moonlawl,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:43:20 2015 UTC,I've noticed only that his gas was super early but it was too late to deal with 4 voidrays.
allthingsprotoss,39ud20,amorrowlyday,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:44:02 2015 UTC,Once you know it's a proxy sg you see if he makes a stalker or msc with first gas. If it's a stalker that's chronoed it's a void ray most likely. Make sure your msc is back be hind the mineral line and try to kite with your stalkers til you can PO.
allthingsprotoss,39ud20,Artikash,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:05:30 2015 UTC,"Everyone else has already answered your question, so I'm going to take a different tact.  Do not care.  Proxy voidray is bad. Straight up god awful. The only thing worse is cannon-turtle voidray. You emphatically did not get proxy voidray'd. You were proxy oracle into voidray'd. That's almost as bad.   Your very first mistake was blind robo. You should be losing outright at that point.  From there you took 4 very expensive detours away from a substantial army: You got blind immortals (250m 100), a forge and a cannon (300m), a nexus (400m), and a second tech path(450m 450g). You can not afford this. You have to pick one. The forge and cannons with immortals will allow to reverse all-in if they all-in, the nexus is a waste if you do not see multiple phoenixes, and just the tech path puts you ahead if they anything besides mass phoenix.   Literally every single 1 base stargate all-in will kill you when you are this unprepared for it.  Then you lost your mothership core without doing anything with it. That all but guarantees that you will die to any 1 base all-in. If you get a photon overcharge off and hadn't lost your first phoenix to voidrays upon scouting them you would be on your way to 5 and a second overcharge when it elapsed and you will win that fight.  Tl;DR: Opening robo is only safe against a particular set of gateway plays. Every tech path can beat it if scouted, so probs don't do it. Do not start multiple different ways to defend yourself without KNOWING what they are doing. you simply can't afford it.  Phoenix beat voidrays, and both blinkers and archons beat them as well. Nothing else does."
allthingsprotoss,39ud20,amorrowlyday,3,Sun Jun 14 22:12:09 2015 UTC,"proxy oracle into 3 gate VR allin is a good build fyi, the nexus cannon is likely forced from the oracle so you just walk in with 2-3 voidrays and stalkers and win. Blind robo FE is viable as well, but it's important to scout with an observer or fake phoenix soon after and transition as needed if you go for that."
allthingsprotoss,39ud20,Gemini_19,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:36:18 2015 UTC,"Point 1. Both triple oracle and 1 oracle 8-10 phoenix variations on the stargate 3 gate all-in seem far more efficient to me.   Point 2. That's not really blind tho. Your opting to use scouting information to determine what to do with that robo, if need be you will also decide to not use it. As I pointed out in my response it is safe, but only if your being as efficient as possible with what you build from it, otherwise it might as well be a BO loss for many different builds."
allthingsprotoss,39ud20,amorrowlyday,2,Mon Jun 15 04:07:03 2015 UTC,"Proxy voidray is bad. Straight up god awful.   Honestly it's not that bad. If you're going vs a stalker heavy opening and they don't scout that you're proxying early enough to deviate and go stargate instead, then you sometimes just auto win because charged void rays kill stalkers absurdly quickly. You can kill 3 stalkers with one charged void ray even if they micro."
allthingsprotoss,39ud20,Gemini_19,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:17:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not positive since I can't do it, but wouldn't blink be able to reduce that count to 2 per charge and be done right around then?"
allthingsprotoss,39ud20,amorrowlyday,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:00:53 2015 UTC,You can't possibly have blink done when a proxy void ray hits. It gets into your base like as the 2 extra stalkers of a 3 stalker rush would be coming out.

allthingsprotoss,39s631,elevenoutoften,2,Sun Jun 14 06:04:00 2015 UTC,For pvt try 1 gate expo into blink robo. You want quick gas at nat and a robo bay. Then just double forge and go from there.   If you go single forge you can get storm as your 3rd or 4th colo comes out. For double forge you wait til much later (after 3/3 is done)  It's hard to tell. If you probe scour and it's obviously an 11 gate proxy you could chrono your stalkers and get a sg. if it's oracle defend and get phoenix. If no oracle you go oracle.

allthingsprotoss,39qsel,paksat,3,Sat Jun 13 21:14:22 2015 UTC,"Standard blink robo destroys this.  Like you said any stargate openers will 100% destroy this. Oracle opening will shut down DTs with ease and phoenix will follow when they see the stargate.   Safe macro DT/robo destroys this. They will have more DTs to their disposal to use in different spots. You need to put a lot more resources into defending multiple spots from DTs than if you got observers.   With the extra money you're putting into the stargate your nexus will be late which puts you behind vs normal macro openers.   With tempests sucking dick now, chargelot archon isn't as good as it used to be so you're going to need a robo at some point so the stargate just doesn't seem to give enough value compared to a robo.   The forge could also be delayed if you put too much into the stargate since you need to put resources into it early for it to pay off compared to later with a robo (takes a while for colossus to start and immortals don't come into play until after your expo is up anyway) so the gap to fit the forge in could be smaller. Definitely will be behind the standard maco opener.   I just don't really see the benefit that the stargate gives. Scouting with phoenix can be done with observers or hallucinations. One oracle and 1 DT harass is easily dealt with with overcharge and a few stalkers. So you're just putting yourself behind in almost every way just to make a ""different"" build that relies on them hopefully not all inning you and the gimmick of the random oracle after the DT.   The only way this works is if it's like the proxy stargate into proxy DT bullshit and you proxy both of them but just reversed."
allthingsprotoss,39qsel,Gemini_19,3,Sun Jun 14 02:08:13 2015 UTC,"I say, play 20 games with this build and report back.  :)  With the amount of gas you're putting into this build, I don't see how you're going to hold off a 4-gate.  Are you making a sentry?  If not, you're hosed because a 4-gate is going to hit you before you have DTs ready.  TC, Dark Shrine, stargate, 1 DT, 1 oracle: 675 gas.  And your expansion is likely later than someone who simply opened robo expand or stargate expand."
allthingsprotoss,39qsel,taomcdohl,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:55:51 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested in seeing how you make it work versus Pheonixes, oracle allins (3g 4g) and blink 3g/4gate.   Sometimes I'll go a stargate midgame, but I usually go stargate after my DT/robo expo is finished and I see that they have expanded."

allthingsprotoss,39qqup,paksat,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:07:58 2015 UTC,"I've been sitting at rank 1 diamond since the start of the season in 2v2 playing PZ for the same reason, trying to macro. Its just about impossible on most maps to play a macro game, especially if the enemy player has a zerg, a walloff doesnt work as well in 2v2.   All I can say is the best strat we've come up with short of cheesing is I take quick two bases into double stargate and void ray production, he goes 2 bases into baneling/zergling, this works well because void rays only really lose to hydralisks and marines, which get rekt by the baneling/zergling.  Since your enemy will always be cheesing you might have to amend the build with a quicker stargate for faster void rays, or if a toss is going blink stalker an immortal goes further than a void ray in smaller numbers."
allthingsprotoss,39pg7i,TTumbeNuss,2,Sat Jun 13 13:56:18 2015 UTC,Take your second gas and another pylon and get your MSC and stalker. Destroy the Ebay and go pressure with your three units while taking your natural base. If they don't have a bunker they lose the game pretty much
allthingsprotoss,39pg7i,incens,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:32:25 2015 UTC,"In the linked replay, the opponent did not even build an ebay, but I deviated from my build as I was afraid of one. What do I do in this case? If I pressure, he will probably kill my economy with a reaper."
allthingsprotoss,39pg7i,Gemini_19,3,Sat Jun 13 15:16:30 2015 UTC,You should be sending your probe a little before you have enough to make the nexus. I rally the probe down at 22 supply (zealot is making) and make 1 more so then it goes to 23 supply. Then if you see the ebay there you let the zealot finish and you take your gas and pylon.  Or if you see the SCV come into your base to scout early then I'll send a 2 probe with my rallied one to meet the SCV that I know is there and make it more difficult for him to place it and to kill the SCV faster if he does start it. It's like when zergs bring 2 drones down when they want to hatch first and you're trying to block it.
allthingsprotoss,39pg7i,Dahktor_P,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:33:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, the second probe sounds like a really good idea. I did know the standard procedure if the ebay has started already, but not how to prevent it. Thank you!"
allthingsprotoss,39pg7i,Gemini_19,2,Sat Jun 13 21:27:30 2015 UTC,"Send a probe to your natural before you have 400 minerals, if there is an ebay block finish the zealot. After that build the MSC, 2nd gas, a pylon, warpgate, and a stalker. After the ebay is destroyed start the nexus and continue your build as usual, though you'll probably need an extra pylon before the nexus finishes to avoid supply blocking.   edit:  the following is incorrect  Also keep in mind that most of the time a terran goes for an ebay block its when he went CC first, so you can sometimes try and poke with the zealot and maybe get a scv or two."
allthingsprotoss,39pg7i,Dahktor_P,2,Sat Jun 13 16:38:56 2015 UTC,"The 2nd part isn't true. It's mostly during a reaper opening so that way you're distracted on the ebay and the reaper has more free reign in the main.   It's actually less common during CC first openers because it will delay their build and they need everything as quick as possible for the build to work in it's defensive manner. Some people like Flash will do it but again, it's not actually common with CC first."

allthingsprotoss,39m6gd,OneManMagicShow,3,Fri Jun 12 18:37:47 2015 UTC,"toss is probably the most build oriented race as far as how important it is for the openings. Have you looked at a build for each match up yet? There is a build order archive as well as a wall off guide in the sidebar.   as far as general vision and map control for toss it comes down to observers hallucinations air units proxy pylons and blinksalkers (matchup, game time and build depending)."
allthingsprotoss,39m6gd,willdrum4food27,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:49:59 2015 UTC,I havent take a look at build orders yet. I think going for a relatively quick oracle wil be my style since I will have map vision with it. I know that in PvT they are epic and they are good in pvz aswell but how about PvP?
allthingsprotoss,39m6gd,willdrum4food27,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:10:22 2015 UTC,oracle openings are def a viable option pvp as well. Tho mechanically I wouldn't put oracle openings as the easiest builds in the world (apart from games that they have no defense for them). So take that as you will.
allthingsprotoss,39m6gd,Spqrhawkz,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:14:58 2015 UTC,"PvP the three common builds would be Blink Stalker, Oracle and robo expand. they kind of ""beat"" each other in a rock-paper-scissors fashion. The less common but still popular would be DT, somethign weird with phoenix's and (in gold league at least) a classic 4gate rush.  Robo expand is probably the most stable of these builds and the one that requires the least micro and game knowlege to excecute.  The other really important parts of pvp are identifying your opponents build. always(usually) go gate on 12 and immediately scout your base for a proxy 2gate, then scout around natural and obvious hiding places, use that probe to scout your opponent immediately after.  Check his pylon count, 2 pylons and 2 gas when you have 3 pylons means something is proxied, usually oracle, sometimes DT. 2 pylons and 1 gas means 4gate. There are a load of old guides on holding 4 gate out there, they might be a bit outdated, but the concepts will still be sound. While facing proxy stargate with robo expo it is super useful to kill the pylon powering the stargate or even the stargate itself, the threat of oracle vs robo expand isnt just in the oracle. Its in teh phoenix which continue to harass, and completely nullify your immotals and sentries in the fight,"
allthingsprotoss,39m6gd,AndDuffy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:45:13 2015 UTC,"I'm high-gold Protoss and I almost always open Stargate in PvZ. Sometimes I get the Oracle depending on the map but more often I just go straight to Phoenixes. They're great for killing overlords/queens/drones and they force the Zerg to play defensively. Also would probably fit your style since they're fast and give you map info. After you get your initial 4-6 phoenix (quick tip, it takes 4 to kill a queen with one lift), you can either transition to SkyToss or play normally and make Colossi."
allthingsprotoss,39m6gd,McVomit,2,Sat Jun 13 08:47:16 2015 UTC,"For map vision probe/proxy pylons, zealots, and observers are your new lings and overlords. Observers and zealots are more for mid/late game vision. Observers to spot drop paths and zealots to scout expansions, you can also use zealots to spot for army movement if there's a large area not covered by a xel'naga tower.  As for walling in, check the sidebar. Every season Gemini posts an album of all the ffe/reaper wall offs.  Edit: Completely forgot about hallucinated phoenix! They're super important for scouting your opponents base when you can't get an observer there in time/past detection."
allthingsprotoss,39m6gd,willdrum4food27,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:51:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I have an other question.When should i send a probe out for proxy pylons? Only when i attack or should i have a ""proxy-pylon-probe""out on the map since the start?"
allthingsprotoss,39m6gd,Spqrhawkz,2,Fri Jun 12 19:08:07 2015 UTC,"no to both. Obvoiusly if you are doing a fast attack you want your scouting probe to stick around and proxy a pylon for it, but usually you will start adding random proxy pylons for spotting, attack and harassment, in the mid game once you have good pylon coverage at home and want to start thinking about counter harassment and attacks."
allthingsprotoss,39m6gd,Endoroid99,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:19:43 2015 UTC,"Post-early game you usually want a probe or two out on the map at all times.  Pylons covering drop areas can save you life. 4 zealots moving in once you opponent moves out can win you games, slow reinforcements or give you the crucial time to get your collosus/immortals/upgrades finished."
allthingsprotoss,39m6gd,notjustjon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:29:12 2015 UTC,"I usually tuck my scouting probe somewhere out of the way on the map (assuming it survived the scout) so its ready to build a proxy pylon, but I don't usually build until I'm ready to attack"
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,avengaar,6,Thu Jun 11 14:17:12 2015 UTC,As a somewhat related comment does anyone actually think the immortal ability is fun? It's just more annoying crap to worry about for me. Immortals seem much weaker with this new active.
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,AnthroGame,3,Thu Jun 11 17:16:20 2015 UTC,"They may be weaker but I think its about 100 times more fun.  It adds actual micro.  When they try to focus the immortal you hit the ability on just that one and you save your whole army a fuckton of damage.  It makes a big difference in a lot of situations.  The immortal may be weaker for just a-moving into massive damage units like before, but its still very strong in the right situation and useful."
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,AnthroGame,9,Thu Jun 11 17:38:43 2015 UTC,But it's pretty much useless if the immortal isn't getting focused. To me it just seems like a babysit button I have to constantly sit and monitor in fights compared to using my apm to blink stalkers or forcefield or drop disruptors or something. Like you click away for a second and roachs murder immortals now. It was like the one unit you didn't have to pay 100% attention to.
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,AnthroGame,2,Thu Jun 11 17:51:14 2015 UTC,"If your immortal isn't being focused it definitely doesn't need the shield.  I mean, a lot of abilities are useless when they aren't called for...   You can still pop it when you pull back a low immortal regardless.  If you aren't pulling back immortals who are low in favor of blinking a stalker I'd say you're doing it wrong.  So theres still time to hit it.  Also keep in mind maybe they're not focusing your immortal because of that ability.  There are a lot of situations where taking the immortal down quick would be the best course of action, and now you have a more direct counterplay to that."
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,AnthroGame,4,Thu Jun 11 18:04:22 2015 UTC,It just feels so arbitrarily added to me. Like why not give thors an ability where you can click it and reload their ammo for 10% more dps against armored or give the colossus an activatable that damages units under it. Idk I mean we can add a million little random abilities to everything but it just makes the game feel more convoluted having expectations that players are going to use everything. I want to set up flanks and macro not play warcraft 3 on steroids.
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,somerandomtoss,3,Thu Jun 11 18:12:36 2015 UTC,"Like why not give thors an ability where you can click it and reload their ammo for 10% more dps against armored or give the colossus an activatable that damages units under it.   The ability fits exactly with the theme of the unit, and the ones you just listed are actually random, unlike the immortal's ability.  Because it takes a unit with a theme to be difficult to kill and takes it from passive to active.  An a-moved immortal is still a lot of hitpoints and damage, but a good player who can make effective active use of the ability can get a lot more out of it in a lot of situations.  If you want to set up flanks and macro, play Zerg.  If you don't want to have to micromanage your units to get the most out of them, Protoss isn't the best choice.  EDIT: Not being an ass, being serious.  Protoss is themed as the race with elite units.  The individual units you can get the most out of.  Obviously thats not universally true but thats the idea in a lot of cases.  You can't just have that be the case with pure numbers and passive shit on units, otherwise Protoss wouldn't be the 'elite unit' race it really WOULD be the newb race that people flame it for."
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,AnthroGame,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:22:44 2015 UTC,I just think we associate the shield with immortals because it exists. I'm pretty sure we could find justification for any random ability. The void ray ability is boring as fuck too. Why did they even change that?  I just don't see the associate with a unit being elite and having an ability. The idea of protoss being elite tech units already is struggling to work in LotV as spreading toss thin traditionally means death with their low gateway tech dps.
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,nideak,3,Thu Jun 11 18:43:07 2015 UTC,"I just think we associate the shield with immortals because it exists. I'm pretty sure we could find justification for any random ability. The void ray ability is boring as fuck too. Why did they even change that?   No. Thats what the immortal is designed as.  A unit that can take a real beating.  Soak a lot of damage.  Thats what its been sold as since the beginning.  Thats what the ability does.  The voidray is meant to do a lot of damage to armor and massive.  It is supposed to shred through heavily armored shit fast.  Thats what it has been always, and thats what the ability does.  I agree that the ability is boring on the voidray, because there isn't typically much decision making or challenge to using it well.  But that doesn't mean it doesn't make sense.  It fits with the unit's designed role, but is not relevant here because this is about the immortal, whose ability does take timing and micro to make a difference.   I'm pretty sure we could find justification for any random ability.   You gave an example of a Thor getting an active ability to do more damage to armor.  That is not the thor's role, so that WOULDN'T make sense.  Your other ability example for the collosus was to do damage underneath the unit.  The unit is long range siege splash.  A melee ability would not fit with the theme of the unit.  Neither would an ability that grants long range aoe against air on marines.   Or an ability that makes zealots have ranged AA for a period of time.  Because these don't agree with the unit's design.  If you can't tell the difference I don't really know what to tell you.  Whether or not an ability makes sense for a unit is nto contingent on whether or not you want that unit to have an active ability."
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,AnthroGame,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:47:18 2015 UTC,"I find that immortal in WoL/HotS is far more micro intensive, pulling back targeted immortals is way more micro then 1 button solution."

allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,iDareToDream,8,Thu Jun 18 06:22:12 2015 UTC,"frankly passive play is mediocre at best against zerg in hots right now as it is. Honestly what might be a good option for you is go back to hots and play more aggressive styles in hots to try to improve your multitasking in a more stable game as that will prolly be an easier stepping stone then trying to learn it in lotv. Like 3 base blink sentry with warp prism mid game pvz, blink before robo or stargate pvt, blink or star openings pvp, and then focus more on warp prism play coupled with active army movement.  As far as the current state of LotV, its impossible to know how the game is going to be  at release."
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,taomcdohl,3,Thu Jun 11 15:51:47 2015 UTC,"I'm just frustrated that they aren't willing to even try things like kicking warpgate to twilight and nerfing it, getting rid of forcefields and buffing gateway units. They've known for years now that toss is the most brittle race, entirely reliant on T3 tech to survive, and refused to do nothing about it."
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,SidusKnight,5,Thu Jun 11 15:48:02 2015 UTC,"We most certainly are not the most ""brittle"" race.  The issue is how our units scale as the game goes on.  Gateway units go from very strong to utter shit in the blink of an eye."
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,iDareToDream,2,Thu Jun 11 17:56:30 2015 UTC,"Gateways units go from very strong to utter shit in the blink of an eye.    That's what I meant by brittle. They just become a meat shield for the T3 tech units. Terran and Zerg can use T1 and T2 units even into the late game, but for toss those units basically do nothing."
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,HogwartsNeedsWifi,2,Thu Jun 11 18:00:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not the biggest fan of that aspect either.  It causes a lot of frustration in many ways.  For Protoss, watching our colossus get picked off by vipers can mean the end of the game, regardless of our other units.  On the other side, a Protoss army can become difficult to stop if allowed to reach that deathball state, regardless of your production.  There is a lot about Protoss that is exponential.  How are armies ramp up, how quickly gateway units can decline, the pacing of the matchups, etc.  That's also what makes the race what it is.  Even in Brood War, Protoss played in that fashion (though within the confines of BW).  Terran is the assembly line, steady as she goes and always producing.  For LotV, I'd say right now Protoss really lacks that early game means of dealing with some strong units.  I will say this: void rays are now more viable in early PvT with cyclones.  Opening stargate is a solid choice right now.  The things that keep us safe in HotS (MSC, forcefields, canons) are severely weaker against ravagers.  For me, I dislike the abilities.  But either way, I hope Blizzard gets their shit together now that Heroes of the Storm has launched.  Also: Happy Cake Day!"

Zerg tier 1 units are far weaker than tosses, what drugs are you on? Zerg doesn't even really have a tier 1 answer to mass blink stalker."

Zerg doesn't even really have a tier 1 answer to mass blink stalker.   Cracklings are wicked in late game situations, especially if toss is already maxed out, and can't warp in units to defend the base being attacked.  And you ignored Terran Bio, which forms the core of the late game army against toss when augmented with ghosts and vikings. Terran can use bio even into the late game and still have it be effective. For toss, no splash damage means auto-lose, because the T1 units are too weak on their own in a straight up fight."

allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,DonJimbo,3,Thu Jun 11 23:37:54 2015 UTC,"Zerg tiers are extremely simply defined- hatchery, lair, hive. In fact I'd say Zerg has the most defined tiers of all 3 races"

allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,BalefulWrath,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:13:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most would say 2.5 because they're lair tech plus an extra building morph. Just like broodlord can be considered 3.5 because of the greater spire tech morph"

allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,BalefulWrath,2,Fri Jun 12 07:32:18 2015 UTC,The game isn't finished yet. I suppose Collossi will either be un-nerfed or become cheaper. They are too expensive and too ineffective after the nerf. Zerg units will also probably get some stat adjustments.
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,thejames42,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:58:48 2015 UTC,I really don't see any adjustments to colossus coming. I think a lot of people are pretty firm on not wanting the colossus to play a major role in the game.

allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,taomcdohl,2,Fri Jun 12 10:47:09 2015 UTC,"Vs Terran the thing that actually changed is the fact that colossi now are definitely underpowered and not worth their price. I dunno how to play lategame vs terran because with Disruptors is virtually impossible to win (Terran lifts the units in medivacs). So the other choices are mass adepts (Which are vulnerable to Emps, but HEY, you need a shitload of emps), and ht compositions, which again are weak vs ghosts."

So we will have to hit them and hit them hard. So if in HotS toss was hated for turtling and Timings/all-ins, in LotV it will be hated for all-ins"
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,AnthroGame,-2,Fri Jun 12 08:28:19 2015 UTC,"Ive always played toss because im medocre at best.  I loved being able to scout and defend until exploiting a weakness.  It played to the strength of the race and my ability.  I just got access to the beta and havnt gotten to play much, but we will definitely be more micro intensive than the other races from what I can tell.  Disruptors are strong and ive taken out large chunks of armies, but its still not quite enough.   I think it will take multi pronged attacks and super scouting to make it, while zerg and terran become more turtle heavy with lurkers and widow mines."
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,Dezib,-1,Thu Jun 11 15:04:05 2015 UTC,"You do realize that's the point?  The very goal is to avoid deathballs and people just moving across with one giant army.  Blizzard wants skirmishes and harassment.  They don't want people just massing one giant army and moving across the map with it.  Yes, right now, Toss is at a disadvantage in LotV.  There needs to be some love.  But it won't come in such a way that encourages the deathball.  In LotV, you need to be harassing bases and defending your own."
allthingsprotoss,39g3q3,AnthroGame,3,Thu Jun 11 16:48:26 2015 UTC,I know but I don't think it impacted the other races ability to build deathball armies. Lurkers win every straight up fight and bio just needs medivacs and a few ghosts to be unstoppable.

For me, it's a ""deathball"" when you have a massive army moving around the map as a unit, which frankly every race does.  So for me it seems more like the Toss deathball got nerfed but every other one was left about the same or strengthened.  What to do about it? I don't know. They don't seem as keen on doing 'radical' changes these days either which isn't quite encouraging."

allthingsprotoss,39cmb0,Leoneri,3,Thu Jun 11 08:33:29 2015 UTC,"You can do gate openers. That's how PvZ was approached long before the game became macro-focused enough that FFEs were common.  You just make a wall at the top of your main's ramp using a zealot, gateway, cybercore.  I actually saw either Naniwa or HuK doing this on stream the other day, they started with the wall at the top of main, but once they scouted and saw nothing crazy was coming, they used the buildings to wall their natural and never finished the wall-in for the main."

allthingsprotoss,39cmb0,Endoroid99,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:30:36 2015 UTC,"Can you explain how this is safe? By going DT, you end up with fewer units trying to get to the tech, plus you have to build a robo. Granted you can potentially get some damage done, but if it gets scouted, it's so easy to stop. I played against a DT robo expand the other day, and i scouted the DS, and shut down his DTs big time"
allthingsprotoss,39cmb0,Abstrusity,2,Thu Jun 11 17:48:11 2015 UTC,"well let's see:   proxy 2 gate - as any build heavy adjustments needed and also needed to be scouted in time to hold  3WG/4WG all in - auto win, just make sentry to ff ramp, and warp in offensive dt or 2, and then at home to help defend.  Blink (all in/no robo) - auto win  Blink (macro with robo) - you have faster expand they are forced to stay at home to defend dt harras, you have access to immortals   SG all-in - also needs to be scouted and you can transition to blink stalkers, and don't get a robo at all. With good micro holdable.  Macro Robo - you are slightly behind on macro, but you have a lot of possibility to catch up with DT WP harras.  Macro SG - this is where this build struggles a bit, but you have early TC and early nexsus, so it is totally playable situation.  Seems that I covered everything, regarding your experience, I find that very few toss even on dia/low master level can keep up with multi prong dt drop-harras, they fall apart so easy (also it is really getting on their nerves making them slip at their macro). You get tech fast end expand fast (both of which are really good), you are a bit of vulnerable for some time, but you have strong harras to keep him at his base."

allthingsprotoss,39cmb0,jamileon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:35:32 2015 UTC,That's not a bad opener at all.  There are people in Master league who approach PvP that way.

I've gotten plenty of practice in PvP since 2011...mostly from when 4gate was the end-all be-all. Now that the meta is a bit different, I can 2gate robo expand into colossus, get early scouting, remain safe from DT, proxygate, stargate (sans proxy oracle rushes, but that's my fault, not the build), or 3-4gate openings. I think it was the best response I could muster that wasn't fully all-in. DECENT forcefields, decent scouting around the base, and you shut down so much of it that it's possible to beat players better than you through build order wins (almost) alone. I think I learned it from White-Ra. Now that 4gate isn't really in style in gold league, I might weave some of them in there, too. Now I just need a solid build order against Terran that protects me against early widowmine harass, but gate-robo-gate has been working well enough for that, too."

Also, if you wait too long and they get a decent stalker/colossus count, your zealots will get shredded and then the stalkers will go to town on your voidrays.    I actually had a PvP game, last night, where I opened phoenix into void rays.  I had scouted him going for charglot/archon/immortal, and he was more heavy on immortals.  In that scenario, chargelot/void ray just mowed through his army.  That said, I wouldn't recommend going phoenix in silver league.

allthingsprotoss,399i2t,somerandomtoss,2,Wed Jun 10 09:09:35 2015 UTC,"most of them are 21 nexus. Standard gate expand is  9 pylon  13 gate  14 gas  16 pylon  Cyber core as soon as gate completes, this should be 17/18  21 MSC, Nexus, gas, pylon, WG(cyber core should finish at about 21, so this should all line up.)  If you were going double gas, it would be   15 2xGas  17 Pylon  and then same stuff on 21 minus the gas, since you already did that  from here, builds will start to defer, but you're gonna want to throw down your tech choice pretty quick here, usually with your next 100/150 gas.   I wouldn't suggest it in PvP though, it's better to delay the nexus a bit to get some unit out. I usually expand somewhere around 30 supply, after i have my robo down, and an immo being produced, and a few units. By then i can defend my main using my immo, a couple of stalkers and photon OC.

Using this opening against zerg will put you behind in economy a bit. In lower leagues where macro sucks, you should be fine, but once you hit gold, you'll want to have a build for each. I write mine in a notebook and have it beside me.   For zerg I like forge fast expands, which is  9 pylon 14 forge 17 nexus 18 gate, , pylon, 2xGas, photon cannon Cyber when gate done  You place these as a wall at your Nat ramp, it protects you from quick zergling rushes. There's a link on the sidebar showing how to layout your wall  This will ramp your econ up faster. Although it delays your tech and units a bit."

It's too passive and it never got me anywhere. Her0's playstyle is something I always looked up to. Doing some crazy tactics with a few gate units, going into phoenix and expanding twice behind the harass. Now that is one playstyle that really looks fun to me, personally. Obviously it's hilariously difficult and he never scouted anything in any game I've ever seen but he is ballsy, I loved that.

allthingsprotoss,397l2c,Artikash,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:55:36 2015 UTC,max out on hydralisks and 2 vipers (more if you think your micro isn't good) and pull all carriers into your hydras and proceed to wreck the VR ball.
allthingsprotoss,397l2c,Elcactus,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:32:34 2015 UTC,"Hydra/queen is a bread and butter counter to anything that flies.  Maybe some vipers or infestors so he can't outmaneuver you.  Also, a big pack of speedlings forces ALOT of void rays in order to stop cancels on the 3rd, keep up pressure there and you'll slow him down so badly that you'll be able to remax multiple times before he has enough to push out."
allthingsprotoss,397l2c,VELL1,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:57:04 2015 UTC,"If he doesn't have storm - you can just a move to victory with hydras...  I actually used to do this build a lot, but in diamond zergs know what's up. Overall, you can use hydras + vipers, by abducting into static defense.  If he has a lot of carriers, just go for infestor and aim for interceptors. Even queens on transfuse actually do really well against air-toss."
allthingsprotoss,397l2c,IWatchFatPplSleep,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:41:07 2015 UTC,Surprised no one has mentioned infestors. Void rays tend to clump and fungal works quite well with some hydras to clean up.

The feeling of making masters (even with all the recent ""patchmaster"" talk which doesn't really bother me) after working hard on it sticks with me. I'm a more relaxed player, the game is more fun, I zoomed up into the top 2% on SC2ranks after clearing the 4% masters border. I offrace, I chat, I don't rage anymore, I don't think about balance.

If you still don't feel motivated after a break, then I don't see why you'd force yourself to play.   In terms of being demoralized, what helps for me is focusing on improvement rather than winning - but I think everyone has different attitudes that work for them."

I've been mostly focused on being a better player, but I've been wanting to get master for a while, and getting close but no cigar is really demoralizing.

allthingsprotoss,3940ry,_ROG_,3,Tue Jun 9 12:52:31 2015 UTC,"What happens to me is that I make a big push on the ladder.  At first, the approach is ""let's just get better and work on those mechanics!"" Then, I start to play people from the next league and suddenly my thought is ""I'm there!  Just a bit more and I got it!"" And now I'm thinking of promotions.    Then I get anxious.  Each loss is a step back.  Each mistake is glaring and massive.  I feel nervous, I only want to ladder when I'm in my peak form of rest and focus so as to not throw away MMR.  And now SC2 has become a job, not a game for fun.  It's VERY difficult to overcome the focus on promotion.  It really comes down to looking at the long-term.  It doesn't have to be this season.  It doesn't have to be next season.  If you stay the course in focusing on improvement and enjoying the game, you will form a stronger mental foundation that will carry you to Master league.  Don't force it, be patient, enjoy the journey and understand that Master league will be there down the road, just as diamond league was.  Remember those late night snafus at 3am when you were in Platinum league?  And yet, here you are in diamond league.  Make sure you're having fun."

allthingsprotoss,392row,ProtossedSalad,5,Mon Jun 8 20:57:46 2015 UTC,"More gateways, for one.  Put down a second forge, a second robo, just keep producing.  If you're at 200 supply, make some more gateways. Don't have stargates?  Make some. It'll help you remax faster after that big engagement.  Imagine taking a big fight, you trade rather evenly, and then you warp in a shit-ton of gateway units immediately to finish off the game.  On two bases, you should have at least 8 gateways, minimum.  Some Protoss make the mistake of thinking ""well, in a perfect scenario, I need 7 gates because that's the most you can produce out of efficiently!""  Those same people couldn't continually produce out of those gateways if they wanted to.  And then they have 2K/2K resources and they can't remax fast enough.  There's nothing like warping in 16 HTs immediately and making 8 archons.  :D"
allthingsprotoss,392row,taomcdohl,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:16:05 2015 UTC,"8? I was told 4 for first base, then 2 plus robo for each other base. Is that cuz of the robo?"
allthingsprotoss,392row,Brad1nator2211,4,Tue Jun 9 02:58:59 2015 UTC,"If you are constantly producing out of all those gateways perfectly, sure.  But you won't.  You'll get distracted with microing units, you'll get supply blocked, you'll be scouting, etc.  You need to get the gateway count up in order to spend the resources.  Let's say you and I play a game. As the game goes on, we both hit 200/200.  So you're building up this pool of resources, 2K/2K or more.  We're both on 3 bases, you have 8 gateways and 2 robos, I have 16 gateways and 2 robos. Then we have this big fight and we trade evenly.  Our supplies both drop down to 130.  Who is going to be able to resupply faster?   There's the mathematical count of gateways and ratios, and then there's reality.  And the reality is that you simply won't be warping units constantly.  Sometimes by mistake, sometimes by design.  You need to build enough production infrastructure to spend your resources.  Just today, I was watching several streams on Twitch.tv.  I won't name anyone, but I watched one particular diamond Protoss.  This person was constantly floating 1K/1K and didn't have enough gateways to spend it."
allthingsprotoss,392row,taomcdohl,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:37:46 2015 UTC,"I see your point. I only brought it up because that was how I was taught protoss, unil you can get more, 4 gateways for main, then 2 gateways and a robo for each additional base until you have resources to spend more."
allthingsprotoss,392row,Brad1nator2211,3,Tue Jun 9 10:29:18 2015 UTC,"I wonder if anyone has updated the Macro or Die maps.  You'd play (either against a person or AI) and if your money got over a certain amount, it would nuke your mineral line.

Probe up to 17, nexus, take both gas.  Follow it up with 17 pylon, cybercore.  Get out your zealot, get stargate when you can and into whatever you want with stargate.  I go oracle for some harass and scouting.  Keeping the oracle alive is a must in that scenario.    Is how I do it right or wrong?  I dunno, that's just how I approach PvZ, and it serves me well typically.  If Zerg cheeses me, it's typically a baneling bust and the oracle pops out just when the banelings will hit.

It also gives you the option to block hatch first and delay 3 hatch before pool.  It's not necessary if you're going a 1gate expand with gas though, as you'll already be safe to zerg cheese, and the option to delay the hatch first isn't that worth it"

PvZ/PvT I don't think anyone has a good idea of what's good right now.  I think Protoss is actually terrible against Terran right now in the macro game. I have no good builds besides fast carrier (which probably only works in the short term), with the colossus nerfed and the disruptor useless against good Terrans. There are 4 gate adept all ins you can do though w/ WP.  PvZ is also very good for Zerg. I've been playing a bunch of archon as Zerg with a low-mid GM zerg and we basically never lose macro games, and we've hit TT1+Kiwikaki many times. Lurkers are realllly good. Carriers are nice, but they'll never become standard since they're not that hard to deal with if the Zerg has a bit of experience against them. Disruptors own roach/hydra if you have good control, you really need to pick up disruptors with WP after they are used though.

Both mechanics can seem unfair from the other side because they sort of are unfair. I guess the unfairness balances out somehow.     Protoss player: I scouted his Ultra tech, made double robo, made immortal/Archon, won the battle with almost half my army left, moved onto creep for the kill, and was suddenly WTF jumped by 40 mutas de-powering all my production buildings that could make anti-air . . .    Zerg player: I have 5 bases to 3. I denied his proxy pylons and only lost a few overlords and 5 drones to his little 4 phoenix hit squad. I'm maxed on roach hydra, and I'm going to kill. WTF!

allthingsprotoss,38h6jh,InfestedNerd,5,Thu Jun 4 04:42:13 2015 UTC,"after the enemy loses his stuff you never know if the enemy is going to replace with swarmhosts, ultras, mutas or roach hydra, so if you left the enemy on max too much you HAVE to keep colossi alive in the fight and then build immortals, phoenixes (have the range up ready) and archons in the remax yourself.  or you just start trading with him constantly to never allow him to get a bank.  I find PvZ to be way easier in low econ games."

I mean A click with main army with guardian, select immortals and start to shift->attack each. Feedback queens if needed of if u have HT, make a warp-in -> go insta attack since ultras are so long to birth so u can catch 1-2 before another zergs attempt to fight. glhf~!"

But once protoss is able to get 5+ immortals with archon support (add storm/stalkers/colossus depending on the specific situation) it's going to be hard for any ultralisk-based army to win a fight.  one last thing, always remember to be targeting the ultras with your iimmortals. Some zergs may add lings or hydras to their composition, and you absolutely don't want immortal shots to be wasted on those units when their only job is to kill the ultralisks."

allthingsprotoss,38h6jh,MiddlingPenguin,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:31:35 2015 UTC,Sim city as in walls at bases? Sim city  above 2 bases is something  I'd like to learn more about.
allthingsprotoss,38h6jh,turbodollop,2,Thu Jun 4 13:47:34 2015 UTC,"yeah so generally against zerg it is very popular at higher levels to do walling for the 3rd base eventually due to the popularity of lings run byes when you are getting aggressive or taking a 4th (doing a complete wall to early can make it tricky to take certain fights). Then that aside when you scout ultras and don't have the proper comp yet, ultras are big ass units that cant fit through small gaps in between pylons. So makes walloffs with small gaps in them will cause ultras to freak the fuck out when A moving into you, and all the lings and hydra and what not, wont free the fuck out, so it lets you take a really good fight by essentially nullifying the ultras until they focus down the wall. Its a good way to buy time for immortals since smart zergs wont attack into the wall unless they know they can win despite it.  (also note not sim city based, if you are pushing out after clearing a zerg army you need to have recall available and/or send out hallucinations ahead to see that is popping out of the eggs before they surround you)"
allthingsprotoss,38h6jh,willdrum4food27,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:19:00 2015 UTC,"This, plus pylon walls at chokes to help keep ultras back due to being massive."
allthingsprotoss,38h6jh,KOUJIROFRAU,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:58:51 2015 UTC,"Scouting - especially in the later game when the Zerg has a bank and tech switches can occur - is obviously important.  Be sure you have observers in place and send hallucinations regularly.  If you do scout Ultras, you might first consider your sim city.  Use Gateways to create choke points, and add cannons at critical expansions.  Even if you don't have the right unit composition, a choke can work wonders versus Ultralisks.  In the mid-to-late game you might find yourself on Stalker/Colossus when the Zerg begins teching to Ultralisks.  With blink and large numbers Stalkers can kite, but they are not the ideal response.  Immortals are great, but it can be hard to know how many to make, and if you make too many you become vulnerable to a Muta switch.    For myself then, I might make a few immortals in response but otherwise begin an air transition.  As long as there are not too many Hydras, Void Rays with Prismatic Alignment will shrek Ultras."
allthingsprotoss,38h6jh,pureatheisttroll,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:06:23 2015 UTC,Obviously immortals archon but even blink stalkers aren't that bad with a good engagement if you see them coming out and don't have the immortals you need you could throw up some pylons or something for some Sim city warp in stalkers while getting your immortal count up
allthingsprotoss,38h6jh,PensiveLemon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:31:23 2015 UTC,Doesn't need to be the best wall ultras are fat just good enough to chock them up a bit also if you can feedback the Queens they will probably have for transfuse that will go a long way
allthingsprotoss,38h6jh,PensiveLemon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:34:38 2015 UTC,"A little tip if you know you are playing vs ling ultra and think you have the right army comp: Add cannons at your bases. Zergs with ultras will have highly upgraded lings that will shred your fringe expansions in runby's. If you can consolidate your expansions and beat the army, you are golden! :D"
allthingsprotoss,38h6jh,TrumpetSC2,0,Sat Jun 6 04:58:40 2015 UTC,"Nowadays, if zerg is on 4 bases and a Hive, which you should know, you should assume that after a big engagement there will be ultras. You can always confrim with hallucination phoenix. Ultras is a huge commitment from the zerg so the key is to be patient and defensive and fight them on your own terms on a choke, usually protecting your fourth. In addition to the immortals/archons frontline, I like having some dts in my army on that engagement. After you destroy the attack advance to kill bases and prepare for desperation mutas."

allthingsprotoss,38ians,avengaar,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:16:32 2015 UTC,"From my play, it seems protoss already has a ""bio composition"" (i.e. A cohesive comp that can go toe to toe with other armies without necessarily needing higher tech as much). This can be seen with gateway + immortal compositions. Zealots still have their uses too. They're the best harass unit for killing structures, as well as being able to mess up the targeting of some units (lurkers, broodlords, ultralisks, cyclones etc.) and can also get ontop of siege tanks without really taking damage. I think they have a pretty nice place, even though they aren't necessarily the ""go to"" army unit anymore."
allthingsprotoss,38ians,Anthony356,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:52:56 2015 UTC,I get your point but much of what I've read says that Zealots are completely shredded by most Zerg and Terran compositions to the point that Charge loses a lot of its value. Giving Zealots the Adept's armor/shield upgrade and/or their shade ability would make a ball of Zealots and Adepts very fast at moving around the map together and at teleporting into the middle of army masses as opposed to having to wade through Lurker insta-death.
allthingsprotoss,38ians,TrumpetSC2,0,Sun Jun 14 12:58:31 2015 UTC,"Funny kinda unrelated idea: I used to play at a high diamond level (I know, not that great, but still pretty cool) with a protoss ""mech"" style. I called it the golden armada because it used primarly gold units: Immortals, pheonix, collossus into carriers and high templar.  Now it sounds super vulnerable, but producing out of 3 robo bays and 2 stargates on 2 bases can hold a surprising amount of things. Its tougher now that everyone is more aggressive, but I still bust it out and win from time to time. It's actually a really fun way to play!"
allthingsprotoss,38fh15,schemestream,2,Wed Jun 3 21:31:43 2015 UTC,"no upgrades means he cant really deal with zerglings very well, trying to constantly run by with lings should keep them pinned back while you tech to mutas or to mass roach hydra ling.  flanking with roaches is always a good idea, have 7-8 roaches outside your base hidden and when the collo try to kite backwards bring them in to kill them.  If you can kill off the majority of the sentries (with roaches/lings), massed zerglings with upgrades can be fairly strong, especially as it leaves you gas to go mutas duraing/after the attack. Really you want to slow down the push as much as possible by threatening with run-by's then in the fight focus on maintaining a good concave and flanking/surrounding the protoss army.  Mass roach can beat this type of army, especially with no P upgrades, as once FF energy is low roaches will trade fairly evenly. try to bait out as much sentry energy early on. catch him coming out of his base and sacrifice a few roaches for 5-6 FF and a sentry kill or two (focus sentries with roaches that get trapped) make sure you have your own upgrades."

They can actually defend it more easily than a more conservative 3rd hatch.  This has been true in my experience as well, I was sangating for awhile and if they get their 3rd around 3:45-4:30, it works great, but if they get it around 3:00 they can hold it pretty well if they are good and end up ahead on econ.  I haven't figured out what the best response is exactly but I like to chrono out a stalker and send it with my mothership core to harass. This at least forces a few lings with minimal investment and can even kill a queen sometimes. Just make sure you keep macroing back at home while you are doing this."

Even if you play on a smurf at least realise what went wrong."
allthingsprotoss,38by7n,Radiokopf,2,Wed Jun 3 06:33:01 2015 UTC,"Radiokopf gave you excellent advice so I'll just expand on a few points:   Your build order in the beginning was inefficient. You want to get gas before the second pylon most of the time. This is the standard gate opener that you will want to use in that case. The harass with the warp prism was a good idea but it did very little and lost you 2 immortals. 4 zealots in the warp prism is safer if you do get attacked by roaches at the front. As already mentioned upgrades were slow. This is important vs zerglings especially, if you have more attack upgrades than your enemy has armour upgrades then your zealots will only take 2 rounds of attacks to kill a zergling instead of 3. Scouting is very important so that you can prepare for your opponent's army. In general you will be wanting to see when the hydralisk den goes down or if your opponent is making a spire, in this case you needed to know it was pure ling so you could get archons or collossi. PvZ is the matchup in which you will be getting your third the earliest. If you're not going for an all in you want to have it down by around 9:00 or you will fall behind."

allthingsprotoss,388kqi,MagicRover,6,Tue Jun 2 16:46:40 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion / POV, but I'd chalk it up to meta.  I'd wager a Terran at Diamond / Master would never expect Protoss to do a 4-gate.  The stacked energy on the nexus would likely trigger Terran to think a proxy oracle is inbound.  Seeing a 1-base Protoss might lead Terran into expecting, and preparing for, a 1-base blink build.  Because you're dealing with people who know and anticipate clean builds at somewhat accurate timings, they're not going to be prepared when a 4-gate hits.  You're essentially playing the meta game and doing something people just do not expect.  This is something I've seen happen to high diamond / Master league streamers.  They get caught off guard, and their initial response is ""this isn't even a build.""  Their play is based upon knowing existing builds and timings, so something unorthodox can (if executed well) catch them off-guard such as a 4-gate."
allthingsprotoss,388kqi,taomcdohl,11,Tue Jun 2 16:57:20 2015 UTC,The stacked energy on the nexus would likely trigger Terran to think a proxy oracle is inbound   if they scout a single gas and think oracle or blink they deserve to lose.

allthingsprotoss,388kqi,taomcdohl,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"By 4 Gate do you mean a simple all in once once warp gate finishes?  I have a terrible win rate vT. Something like <40%. If all I have to do is all in off 4 gateways around the 7 minute mark, thats what I'll be doing for now on."
allthingsprotoss,388kqi,Severson9,2,Tue Jun 2 17:37:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, 1 base 4gate. I guess there are some variations in how you do it but I make the first warpin around 5:40. And I only do it on 4 player maps to make it harder to scout.  This is the build order I uses if you wanted to try  9 Pylon 12 Gateway-probe scout 14 Assimilator <- 3 probes 16 Pylon @ 100 % Gateway Cybercore 18 Zealot ( no cancel ) @ 100 % Cybercore, Warpgate with constant Chrono @ 100 % Zealot, Stalker Go to 20 probes in total + 3 Gateways as you get the recources @ 100 % 2nd Stalker make 3rd Stalker make 2 proxy pylon ( you know where terran has spawned by now after scouting with the probe )  And then you Move out with the Zealot, 2 Stalkers and Warp in 4 Stalkers. Your ability to micro matters since you want to targetfire marines/kite/have zealots in front/ only lose 1 unit to mines and so on but usually it is pretty easy to win if terran doesn't expect it."
allthingsprotoss,388kqi,ssjGinyu,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:44:33 2015 UTC,FYI 4gate all in should hit around 5:50ish. You could try an 11 gate 3 gate instead but I've never seen that done in PvT. Tbh I've never seen a 4gate PvT since HOTS release either but 11gate 3gate replaced 4gate in HOTS.

allthingsprotoss,388kqi,GoldKey0,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:22:53 2015 UTC,"When does the drop hit? Probably after a 4 gate hits I imagine. Even if he gets the drop to your base, don't you still win?"
allthingsprotoss,388kqi,FlorianSC2,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:42:41 2015 UTC,"You can hold a 4 gate with just one reactored barracks, if he lifts nat CC to main and buils 2 bunkers and repairs he can basically hold forever."
allthingsprotoss,388kqi,FlorianSC2,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:06:19 2015 UTC,"A mine drop hits after the 4gate for sure but from my experience it is true that terran can just hold in his main with 2 bunkers, and then the biggest problem is rather that you are 1 base down..  But if terran makes only 1 or less bunkers or is not ready to repair you can still win but from my experience your micro matters a lot when you do a 4gate against widow mines."
allthingsprotoss,388kqi,ssjGinyu,0,Wed Jun 3 07:13:43 2015 UTC,"The problem with 4 gate is that there's no real skill involved in the executuon. If the terran doesn't scout it, he's fucked, but if he scouts it, you shouldn't be able to do anything at all. It's really just a gamble. You need your zealot + stalker out on the map to defend the probe, which means you cant prevent a reaper scout. I actually think the way to get the highest possible winrate with a 4 gate is if you proxy your 3 gates."
allthingsprotoss,388kqi,Emyndri,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:25:12 2015 UTC,"low mid masters players are still relatively ""bad"" and all ins/cheese will always be incredibly strong in sc2 because of how one misclick can cause a lost game and cheeses are often defended by the skin of your teeth so you come out ahead. With this in mind, 4gate and what not will get you very far on the ladder system but you won't actually improve as a player and the game will surely get stale and boring amounting to a time investment for some numbers on a screen that you no longer care about. The reason why I love SC is because of how difficult it is and how much there is to learn. Becoming as perfect as possible and working on mechanics so you can perform whatever strategy you want is why the game is so interesting, not picking gambling strategies and hoping that you mis micro last or that you get a BO advantage. At the highest level (which is the only level that the game is intentionally balanced for) 4gate vs terran is not at all viable. Blink is just straight up a better option."

It just seems to me like there is absolutely no struggle vs mech on GM level so I want to know what all tosses are doing that I'm not doing. And since you basically never see good players play vs mech I never get the chance to see how they would deal with it and all the small things they do.  Basically I just want to know if there is any standard, optimal way that all pros approach mech with.

Also having eyes on the front of his base so you can intercept his move out so he has to siege and unsiege repeatedly. Wayward zealot warpins for harass and flanks are huge too. If you do go for a straight up engagement you have to make sure you set up a massive, super wide concave and a few flanks. Hope this helps."

Random player here - and Terran is what I have played the most, and of all the matchups losing TvP as the T is the most frustrating.  It feels as if all things being equal Toss is at a considerable advantage, from a demand of micro in engagements while macro'ing back home.   Additionally, it is very difficult to scout and many of the cheeses look very similar so you can ""guess"" be wrong and get run over.  Late game, as terran you feel helpless against several different comps.  This has been my experience, but I've heard several terran players explain it the same way - the herp derp A move is real if you are plat or below."
allthingsprotoss,37x0tf,tyrs,5,Sun May 31 22:04:06 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you need ghosts. Ghosts make the matchup so T favored I don't think a lot of terran realize it. If you get EMPd you CANNOT fight the T army. At below masters though people bitch about the herp derp A move even though most terrans dont have the micro to do anyhting but that themselves. Not many terrans below masters can multi drop, and push a base and control it all, let alone use ghosts effectively. As for cheeses, just make more bunkers. Seriously. that shit is scary as fuck to push into. You think you have enough? add 2 just to be safe.

allthingsprotoss,37x0tf,Dezib,1 point,Sun May 31 22:22:10 2015 UTC,"In defense of lower league Terrans, I feel like newer Protoss and Zerg are taught that mechanics are important, but a lot of low league Terrans have this warped mindset where they don't realize how important macro is, which is especially true for a race like Terran where their macro mechanic gives them a ton of minerals (moreso than Zerg or Protoss whose macro mechanics allow them to spend their resources quickly).  They also live in this strangely toxic mindset perpetuated by other Terrans and idiotic Terran streamers that it's not mechanics but imbalance or overreliance on micro that holds them back.   Thus, I cannot count the number of lower league Terrans who take maxed engagements despite being behind in supply or floating thousands of minerals, and who have maxed out compositions of only marine/marauder/medivac that lack ghosts or have fewer vikings than I have colossus, lose, and then rage about how the matchup is imbalanced."

allthingsprotoss,37x0tf,GreedoShotKennedy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:22:58 2015 UTC,"I'll add to this as a Terran myself. When I was in diamond league, I didn't have the gamesense to properly scout and counter allins, so it was very frustrating to lose to Protoss players who proxied something, but I was never sure of what that was. At that level it is definitely easier to allin than defend it. But as I got better, this stopped being a problem, because I refined my builds and developed my gamesense so I could get pretty good reads off of not very much. But without that, it is extremely difficult in early game TvP, since most of the time you can't scout very much and end up doing coinflippy builds if you get frustrated. I wouldn't envy diamond terrans if I were you; they are in a tough spot until they put in a dedicated effort to improve.  TvP lategame used to not be very frustrating when I could successfully use ghosts but Protoss players hadn't yet learned how to play against them but from about mid-masters on up to the highest levels it's a hard road in the lategame. It's a strange matchup because there can be so many of these imbalances based on level of play alone, more than in TvZ at least, so a lot of Terrans feel frustrated because at their level, it is very difficult.

allthingsprotoss,37x0tf,Capslock2Q,0,Sun May 31 23:30:48 2015 UTC,"It might be bcoz of the engagements in lategame and early game cheese the toss can do. I've seen a lot of whining around plat - top diamond. That's where the a-move from terran isn't enough, but it's enough for toss still. Most dia/plat guys with 80-100 apm can't split vs storms so they die. On this skill level toss can a-move and throw few storms and win if the terran isn't controlling properly.   In short: it's easier to be plat/dia toss than terran in tpv.  Another cry level begins when the terrans learn to micro vs a-move storm toss army but start facing a toss in GM/top masters who actually microes the stalkers etc. Then the 2nd wave of cry starts again.  That being said I'm a terran and i often get flamed for dropping WM or going proxy rax vs toss saying how shit my race is.  It's not just terran who cries."

allthingsprotoss,37viph,coasterboard,2,Sat May 30 19:17:48 2015 UTC,"So, just to comment on the build, if you are going gate first, might as well do a semi-attack to force some units, otherwise you might as well do a FFE, at least you'll be better economically. If you don't want to engage early, at least take your 3rd around 6-7th mark, you have the units the defend it.  Overall the biggest mistake is lack of scouting. I mean if anything you were lucky he went standard could be mutas and you would lose the game instantly. You sent a probe down there, but didn't even know about his gas level or anything.   So then you made a push....and you were supposed to win the game, but then you FFed you zealots out of hydras...you were supposed to FF hydras closer to yourself to allow zealots to engage, instead, your zealots couldn't do a thing, still you had so much more army you sniped the hatchery.....and then recalled??? man, he had like 2 hydras and a roach....there was no reason to recall, you had the game in hand. He played so poorly in the begining and you were a clear winner up until that point. You could have steamrollered him, you had like solid 10-20 force field remaining as well. So anyways, that would be a game ending push that you missed.   Then he recovered, but stayed on roach\hydra. You had the right idea to have lots of sentries, especially your next engagement was so poorly located, he had a big arc on you, but yet you managed not to use a single forcefield....like this is the essence of your army. they don't do any damage, they are there to forcefield shit and make the guardian shield, but you activated neither. Storms were nice, but roaches do well against it.   Overall about the style. So I am actually trying to learn the same, gateway heavy style right now and it's hard as fuck, so I know how you feel. Zerg is my least favorable match up as well. Still. the style relies on your ability to attack at multiple directions and use your mobility to snipe shit everywhere. Put pylons all over the place. Instead of just dropping zealots head on into his army to kill the hatchery, fake an attack on some base...and THEN do it.   You also forgot to chrono the 10th probe, forgot to put probes on gas on your 3rd and could have used twice as many gateways."
allthingsprotoss,37viph,VELL1,1 point,Sat May 30 22:35:59 2015 UTC,"I agree; you (OP) were lucky that a muta ball didn't turn up on your mineral line and ruin your day from lack of scouting. Just a simple phoenix hallucination from your sentries is a cheap and fast way to get some useful info about his tech choices. Alternatively, poke at his base with some units early on to see if he defends with roaches or lings.     Likewise I think using forcefields correctly is a mandatory protoss skill in all matchups. You'll need to make a judgement about how big your army is compared to his and how the engagement might go. If you're about even, slice his army in half by placing an arc of 4 or 5 FFs through it. If you're easily going to win, trap his army in the engagement by placing FFs behind him. If you're going to lose, you might be able to place some blocking FFs directly in front of you to escape, but I personally am usually dead by then."

Build Order- I'm trying to go gateway first into nexus so that if I see a fast zergling rush, I can get zealots out faster. Is there any merit to that? Or would a 6-pool screw me either way?  Scouting- I didn't even realize I didn't hallucinate a phoenix. I usually do. I definitely got lucky there was no muta switch  Recall- I had been trying the most recent BOTW and gotten in the habit of recalling out after killing a third. I obviously should've just finished the job this time. Not the first time I've made that mistake and lost after being ahead.  FF- I have a lot of trouble casting more than 1 thing well in a battle. I tend to have all my units in the same control group and tab through the unit types. So by the time my storms are done, my sentries are dead. I should probably start putting templars and sentries in different groups right?  Thank you for the responses and for the other really good points you made about the replay. I have a lot to work on.  It seems like in PvZ especially, there are so many things I have to do right, and if I neglect any of them, it isn't even close.

I was playing super safe and felt like going down the ramp would have given me a massacre and him the win. So, I stayed on top kept my units spread and hold positioned. Took a single warp prism from the side of the map, went to his base warped in 3 DTs, bunch of zeeelots and the poor terrano was left with basically no econ and an army in front of my base. I found it funny that he kept up the siege while having his economy and production being destroyed.

allthingsprotoss,37ppqg,HymirTheDarkOne,8,Fri May 29 12:45:03 2015 UTC,Traditionally you would transition into an army with Zealots for tanking. Zealots benefit more from armor upgrades than shield upgrades.  With the nerf of the Swarm Host there's nothing really forcing you to transition. The shield upgrades benefit Phoenixes as well in the event of a Mutalisk switch.  I think it has some merit to reconsider Protoss upgrades.
allthingsprotoss,37ppqg,Wizzad,3,Fri May 29 12:51:30 2015 UTC,In Lotv I no longer get armor upgrades because of how massive the shields on adepts (the main tanking unit) are compared to their HP pool. I think armor may fall by the wayside.

allthingsprotoss,37ppqg,aihyur,1 point,Fri May 29 17:12:22 2015 UTC,"oh, well then I'm pretty sure you get shields right away. I've heard some pro players saying you shouldn't even get armor, but it might be a personal thing. Tbh at the point of the game when +3 is already finished I don't think it's the biggest of deals if you get +1 armor then shields, +1 shields or straight to +2 armor. But yea, shields definitely benefit you more when it comes to muta switches, while I assume armor is better vs ultra styles. I always skip armor for shields tho."
allthingsprotoss,37ppqg,ssjGinyu,1 point,Fri May 29 17:29:30 2015 UTC,I prefer going straight into shields. by that point in the game i'm either adding in air or archons and I have enough gas to make up for the slightly higher costs.
allthingsprotoss,37ppqg,southernstorm,0,Sat Jun 13 03:04:33 2015 UTC,however shields costs more than armor and shields... and id rather have those for an extra 50/50 than shields regardless of adepts ..
allthingsprotoss,37qzif,phapsubongtoi,2,Fri May 29 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"you are probably holding on to the build too tighty. The build isn't supposed to play for you. If you scout a ling speed all-in, or speedling to 3 hatch, anything cheesy. React accordingly. The build is a milestone to GET you to the point in the build. So depending on the scout, you should always tweak appropriately. Also, builds are usually very good when they can be flexible, and be tweaked but still get you to the end result. Which is for sure what this build does. Post a replay. Other than that Idk D= just general knowledge and going off what you gave"
allthingsprotoss,37qzif,M0ka,1 point,Sat May 30 04:51:07 2015 UTC,"hrm. I don't see why you don't have enough to hold. You have a forge and gates and  sentries. As your buildings start to die just rewall off and FF when you can. Can add some cannons and if you are able to scout the likely lack of 3rd or general lack of drones/large ling count you should already have a cannon or 2 up before it hits. If its a stupid fast ling allin, that is like gas before natural, I alter my build a lot vs that. But this sounds like a slower ling allin like off a hatch first."

allthingsprotoss,37i10u,StoicLoofah,2,Wed May 27 20:00:06 2015 UTC,I have used a very similar strategy and played against similar things as zerg. One of the issues I have with it is the zerg will pretty much be watching the build the entire time because no units that shoot up and can clear overlords will ever be built. Any all in that really has very little ability to deny scouting is extra risky. I think you can hold this build with any type of units as a zerg as long as you don't under respond the same way a 4 gate has always been.
allthingsprotoss,37i10u,avengaar,1 point,Thu May 28 18:20:36 2015 UTC,"That's a great point! I think that ""cheese"" inherently relies on your opponent not knowing what is going on, and how much a build relies on sneakiness versus lack of scouting versus denying scouting greatly affects its viability.  Do you by chance have any replays where you felt like your opponent did an exceptional job holding against it? I realize this is /r/atp, but it would definitely be informative to see the flipside of how this fails."
allthingsprotoss,37i10u,avengaar,1 point,Thu May 28 20:36:11 2015 UTC,"I don't have a clue what replay it was so sorry I don't have a good replay. However I think I can explain how it fails.   2 Player map the ov will eventually see the front usually before the adepts are out. In response to the 2 adepts:   start speed and don't mine more gas for now.  drop a spine in the main and the natural mineral lines and don't build any lings yet (might be overkill, queens would probably work as well but I like it because it lets you drone as hard as you want with no real threat of being overwhelmed yet.) Try to get up to 4 queens total and keep pumping out drones If the ov sees no expo after the 2 adepts and adepts are still being produced just don't over drone.  Running by a few lings to the toss front is really annoying because adepts are so slow. Lings banes roaches or queens can probably all hold off mass adept as long as you have a good engagement and don't them them endlessly escape back and forth with their teleport.   I do think the build has potential but it will 100% fade when people get used to it because it is very hold-able once people understand the response to adepts."

allthingsprotoss,379zgj,SexBobomb,1 point,Tue May 26 13:10:36 2015 UTC,I believe the general thought process is around the minerals for pvt at the front for pvz and close to the nexus I.e. lowest travel time possible for building probe for PvP just make sure not to clutter your main too much you're prob gonna be running a stalker after an oracle and you don't want to be blocking his route

allthingsprotoss,379zgj,SevenCityJP,2,Tue May 26 14:58:42 2015 UTC,"Here is the build order you need.  You also need to be constantly producing probes for it to work:  9-Pylon  (xD) 13-Gateway 14-Gas (put 3 probes in immediately upon completion) 16-Pylon @100% Gateway-Start Cybernetics Core @100% Cyber Core-Start Warpgate research and build Stalker ~20-22-Pylon  Stalker will be complete by the time the Reaper gets to your base to defend.  You can make a Mother Ship Core instead of a Stalker, but that delays warp gate and is not as fast moving as Stalker.  If you kill the reaper with the stalker, send stalker to his natural to scout/harass.  Reaper usually means a fast expand so you might be able to delay/cancel his Command Center.  But don't lose the stalker to units.  If it's well defended, just turn back and expand yourself immediately or try to put on some good agression.  You don't want to be a one base Protoss vs a 2-base Terran, so whatever you can do.  But then again, if it's Bronze, they may not know what to do with all the money they get anyway...  You can also place buildings behind the mineral line to wall off so if Reaper wants probes, he has to go through the mineral line, if that happens, select all probes and a-move to surround him.  You can also pull the one he's attacking to try and draw him in.  Or you can pull like 6 probes to chase if your Stalker or MSC is almost ready.  Reaper will still run from many probes.

As for my outplay comment, you obviously didnt understand that either, but I've gotten used to that by now. I said that he has to outplay his opponent specifically because chargelot archon is HARDER TO PLAY. If he expects to win 50% of his games after switching from colossus based play he is going to be surprised.   As for your last paragraph, I dont even know what you're trying to convey.

It works well as long as WM count is not too high. People get scared of 4-5 WM and start switching into something else....like unless he has 15 WM and uses them correctly, this style is very very very good. Even with a high WM count, just try to flank him and get into his base with everything you have and just storm whenever he tries to engage. This style is all about positioning and WM are tough to micro on offense, they are good as a defensive hold, but if he is out of the position, WM are just empty supply."

But wm are the better choice cause they don´t require high numbers. even one wm is effective and the burst damage is better cause you kill the zealots before they can do damage

In fact, it can catch Terran players off-guard since it isn't seen very often.  If a Terran just assumes Protoss is playing standard upon seeing a 1 gate FE, they will be in for a surprise when the Chargelot/archon train rolls in.  Master league and up?  Sure, it's not something to hang your hat on.  But below that, I think it's a build that all Protoss players should know and use to change things up."

Also i advice you to produce at least 2 observers and positioning them close on the most likely drop spots so that you can prepare yourself when spotting an incoming drop on the minimap.

allthingsprotoss,36wwir,EleMenTfiNi,1 point,Sat May 23 17:57:39 2015 UTC,"I guess they did hack.  First of all: the terran player placed way more bunkers than you usually get without scouting. It is normal to get 1 bunker on the ramp, but he got 3. Just before the attack he even added an fourth bunker. he could have gotten the idea that something was going on, because there wasn't a fast expansion going up for both the tosses. But then it is still an overreaction against not scouting.  secondly: Looking in the fog of war at the stalkers (suspicous, but possible).  thirdly: being quite consistent in dropping mules throughout the game, but saving loads of energy after the dark shrine is placed. You can forget to drop mules, but he even builds addons and refineries very close to his natural, and then ""not noticing"" the huge energy bar. Most platinum players will notice that. It looks like he was concious about the decision not using mules, and saving energy for scanning the DTs  fourthly: placing an Ebay without using it for upgrades, but instead for turrets on the ramp. There is no way the zerg would have spotted the DTs when the turrets went down. It requires some very serious game sense to put turrets up at your ramp for only DTs, if you fear possible harrass you get them in or just out your mineral line to be safe against oracles and DTs.  fithly: a moving to the path the DTs are taking, then scanning. You usually just sit down after you spot the DTs so you won't take any damage. But he went for the suspicous intercept.  i guess that is enough proof."

The DTs could've been spotted en route to the enemy base by the lings. Or the Terran player was simply looking at his army when they passed. DTs aren't very hard to spot, even cloaked.  As for the pylon, that is a very common spot to place a proxy pylon on this map and I'm not surprised he took a peak over there.

The zerg player sees the dts at your big ramp and a little after the terran starts missile turrets and is watching his units then sees the shimmer and scans.  As far as attacking undefended expansions its zerglings. It was more likely an intended run by that turned into lets kill this nexus.

More if they do a 2 base one.   Should I be keeping my stalker/observer combination at home the entire time I'm getting dropped?   You should have an observer on each drop path so you can see them before they drop so you can react.   Should I be backing up HTs and zealots with cannons?   Is there a reason not to?   what kind of early (any time before 2nd base saturation) offensive moves can I make to discourage widow mine dropping without leaving me too defensively vulnerable?   You don't. You wait for them to do it, completely destroy it, and then go counter attack because they won't have many defenses and they're in their transition period getting add ons and stuff."
allthingsprotoss,36wug8,Gemini_19,1 point,Fri May 22 20:14:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been trying to have my army out on the map - e.g. if I have 5 stalkers, I have 3 stalkers out poking, 2 at home. But I see how it's better to wait for the mine drop and then doing a stronger counter after a complete defense. Guess I have to check myself more when I want to posture aggressively but need more defense at home"
allthingsprotoss,36wug8,Gemini_19,2,Fri May 22 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"The thing is, is that you're not going to be able to do anything with that little stalkers that early so it's better to defend with them."
allthingsprotoss,36wug8,SkyBlaze93,2,Fri May 22 21:06:49 2015 UTC,"I would  13gate scout    Check the gas(gas mining) and if no repear is scouting your base you should play very defenseively. it's going to be either a factory  or 2nd rax with tech lab, but the chances are it's going to be a factory. after nexus go robo > obs leave ob in main and rally all probes to main base and keep all the stalkers at the main mineral line and have MCS at nat for front push. Leave the 13gate scout probe on the map for a 2nd poke at the terran nat after you place down your 2nd base. To check for their own 2nd base try to kill the SCV building it.   If you see the norm which is a scouting reaper   Make MCS and stalker after nexus try to kill the reaper b4 the 2nd stalker is out if you cannot kill the reaper before that, it's fine. Leave your base with 1 stalker and MCS to scout the terrans  main base. while the 2nd stalker and 3rd stalker defend off the reaper while you tech up to eiither robo/blink/stargate/forge. When scouting the terran with MSC and the stalker check the buildings if there either 3 rax or factory and starport. While getting your 2nd and 3rd gate, than ahead back your base and your obs ( 1 & 2) should be out in time. should have about 4-6 stalkers if timed right.   Tips for 2nd base def vs mine   When poking with the MSC and stalker. Leave the stalker in a position where it can shoot at units attacking the MCS. On MSC path in and out of the terran base. Leave the 1 first obs at nat mineral line. Send 2nd ob to main mineral line. Target fire with the nexus overcharge on mines if no stalkers around if stalkers are around and can shoot at the drop b4 it makes to the the mineral focus the drop ship. Pull probes by using location hotkeys to pull them. example F1 to jump to base that has the drop box the probes  than F2 to safer mineral line. making sure that the probes mineral walk.  No matter what happens as long as the mine does not kill more than 2-3 probes your in a good position even though you lost ""mining time""."
allthingsprotoss,36wug8,Burst3004,1 point,Sat May 23 06:50:09 2015 UTC,"I recommend 3 stalkers at the beggining, most of the openings count with it so your economy and tech dont will be affected. NEVER put 2 cannons per mineral lane if the terran its not hard dropping you (for hard drop i understand 1-2 drops per minute). Always try to avoid building cannons, they are a potential gateway because a gateway and a cannon cost the same  and a gateway will be more useful. I recommend you use a blink into robo build so the drops after the 8 minute mark will be more easy to defend. Until the blink is up its mandatory to have observers in the sides of your base to spot the drop coming. If the drop its already on ground warp in zealots, if you see the drop coming warp ht's or stalkers or them both, if you just want to leave a small force to defend posible drops place a group of 5 stalkers and a ht if you want. You cant pressure the terran before colossus if you are not doing some kind of all-in. Maybe a PvT Phoenix/Colossus build makes the terran more afraid of drops. You should try this builds:  -Blink into Robo  -Phoenix/Colossus  And work on you minimap awareness to spot the drops with your observers."

You can also try to bait them into storms with this.  It's quite intensive and tbh it's incredibly inefficient. You rely too much on stalkers, and chargelots which are easily countered by some siege tanks or widow mines, and I don't think you can really be cost effective that way.  Also since it takes so much of my attention to do it, my macro suffers a lot from it. But that's because I'm scrubby.  I still have to find a good solution though."

You do need to be careful with your oracle not to run into an early widow mine however. Build a few pheonix and use them to control drops and harass throughout the game.   Cyclones are pretty mediocre in big fights as well and are very reliant on kiting so once the game progresses they need a lot of support and planning to really be effective.

You are cutting the 2nd stalker that's pretty standard. the 2nd stalker lets you move the stalker to the watch tower or in front of their base without having to of killed the reaper. This lets you get reads on any fast push as it crosses the map. So that's why its usually gate>stalker>stalker>sentry. Also dat storm opening. Storm opening with no harass to pin them at home and no colossi fake. That's just praying you opponent is passive and doesn't scout your openings and start reactor mines.

I find I get rekt quite a lot when I take the third that early against standard terran play since I dont have enough units to defend on several fronts. Maybe my build just sucks though.

Currently i try to be more active on map with blink stalkers and try to catch some medivacs on the open field. Checking out that phoenix-style build that's floating around recently might be worth.

allthingsprotoss,36it8q,avengaar,2,Tue May 19 19:14:25 2015 UTC,"I didn't check the replays but here's some very easy advice:  Add enough Warp Gates per base. As a general rule of thumb try to have 3-4 Warp Gates per mining base. With 3 Warp Gates you will have more money available for tech and expansions, with 4 Warp Gates you will spend most of your money on units. This means that 3 Warp Gates per base transitions well into the late game, and 4 Warp Gates allows your attacks to be stronger.  Of course you should avoid being supply blocked. Try to glance at your supply and resources as often as you can. The more you aware of your resources and supply, the less likely you will float resources and be supply blocked.  This is easy advice for beginners. As you get better you can change it up or you can pick up a build made by a professional player.  Also if you're floating 1k+ minerals or you simply want more production, don't be afraid to put down some extra Warp Gates."
allthingsprotoss,36it8q,Wizzad,1 point,Tue May 19 20:37:34 2015 UTC,This is so helpful! For some reason I never thought about adding more warpgates than 4 total.. I always hit my expansion at around 16ish and get my harvesters out as soon as the last one finished at the new Nexus and keep myself from being supply blocked while pumping out stalkers/sentries from the 4 gates but never thought of making more gates.
allthingsprotoss,36it8q,rorosama,2,Tue May 19 21:48:27 2015 UTC,"Remembering to make probes constantly will alleviate some floating problems, as well as constantly making units. Stalkers vs. p & t, and sentries vs. Zerg as examples. Also keep a good amount of production going, as in not like having 2 gates on 3 bases"
allthingsprotoss,36k2c4,elevenoutoften,1 point,Tue May 19 23:30:50 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about proxy 1gate? Normally it leads into macro games, but it's very aggressive and a little cheesy. Here are some scenarios:   1) if it's not scouted it can have high potential damage and can win the game for the player (usually with a 3gate followup)  2) if it's scouted late OR the player doesn't deal with it well (IE it does damage), it can lead into a macro game where the defending player is behind.  3) if it's scouted and shut down, it leads into a macro game where the attacking player is very far behind (but not unwinnable)."

allthingsprotoss,36h5gz,OnthefarWind,2,Tue May 19 10:34:41 2015 UTC,"I'm loving my oracles, I experimented with 3-4. Their mine ability is sooooo good for zoning and map control. Even offensively, I can probably kill a hatchery with 1-2 VR and 4 oracles just by abusing the mines, even against full squad of hydra-queens. Right now I'm doing greedy fast 3rd expos off an oracle opening, but instead of transitioning out of it, I keep making them. And I can stall the enemy with mines ~forever starting with their natural ramp. They take so long to cross the map that I can fully saturate the base and get 10+ gates online before they make it.   Early adept pushes...I can't even compute the micro potential. I'm not bad at micro at all (hello wc3 background), but the amount of stuff I can do with them blows my mind, especially if you add a prism to it all. I tried 13 gate nexus into 4-gate adept push against zerg...it's VERY strong. if zerg had trouble dealing with 8 zealots in hots, he can now do ~0 against 8+ microed adepts.   I have very limited PvT experience so far, and haven't got a chance to experiment much. I've mostly played PvZ."

While I keep Zerg distracted with 4 adepts I prepare for a follow up 5 gate adept push while researching Blink and +1 and getting a third up. Once my third is up, I'll have Blink and +2 on the way and I transition to the HotS standard of Blink Stalker Sentry to finish the game. :)"
allthingsprotoss,36h5gz,TorkkSC,1 point,Tue May 19 16:09:11 2015 UTC,I made a thread about builds a few weeks ago.   PvZ  Every build is on a clock now with lurkers existing so the matchup has somewhat reversed in that way. Any builds need to be able to combat hydra lurker or kill them before they can get out lurkers. There are a lot of strong pushes or openings but allowing the zerg to build lurkers is probably gg or at least going to be very rough if you don't have a good amount of bases and storm/carriers. Once you get to like 6-10 lurkers nothing can beat them on the ground and attacking into them is completely impossible to trade efficiently.   So I guess when I'm doing a build I think about if I'm trying to combat lurkers or kill the zerg before they can get them out.   PvT   Far less reliant on tech units than before in my mind because of how strong the adept is against marines. I tend to play reactive and open stargate as terran has a lot of possible tricky openings where stargate is a strong counter. Phoenix remains to still be strong transitioning into adept zealot ht armies.   PvP   Played under 10 of them in around 150 games so not really sure.
allthingsprotoss,36h5gz,avengaar,-3,Thu May 28 18:28:26 2015 UTC,too early to talk about LotV considering there is no release date set.  On the other hand. Adept Rush into blink +2 is good against Z xD

If I were you, I'd concentrate on mechanics for a while before attempting to learn more complex builds.  that said there does not exist a 2 base all-in that works for all matchups; PvP usually starts with 1 base play while looking for an opportunity to expand safely, and while gate FE is a viable opener in PvT and PvZ, what happens after that diverges based on how the two races currently approach the midgame. 6 gate blink used to be potentially viable in PvT and PvZ but it's a bad build nowadays - it could work but only based on your opponent's mistakes."
allthingsprotoss,36fvv6,KOUJIROFRAU,1 point,Tue May 19 02:58:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replay, even though it's viable to get to platinum off of this build I just don't really like playing just 1 way. Heck, it's viable to get to masters purely by cannon rushing like breaking bad does.  Maybe I'll do some more 3 Gate Robo and then bite the bullet and figure out a 2 base build for each of the matchups, though I think in PvP as you said you expand when it's safe so I'd probably just stick w/ this build and learn how to macro out of it.  For PvT is a 2 Base Colossus Timing one of the better options?"
allthingsprotoss,36fvv6,KOUJIROFRAU,2,Tue May 19 03:03:25 2015 UTC,"hmm, lots of simple 2 base builds if you are willing to learn a separate one for each matchup (as you should be)  DT Robo expand for PvP is the easiest/safest (execution wise) way to secure a 2nd base, and of course DTs can potentially end the game as soon as they hit  2 base colossus is fine for PvT, I personally like a couple of 1.5 base all-ins in the matchup but they're not really different from 1 base all-ins besides mindgames/free room to transition out if you fail  PvZ has a plethora of 2 base all-ins so I guess you can look up and pick your favorite, immortal-based attacks are generally the simplest"
allthingsprotoss,36fvv6,KOUJIROFRAU,1 point,Tue May 19 03:17:39 2015 UTC,"Alright thanks. I will look for a 2 base PvZ w/ some immortals, and a DT Robo expand for PvP.  For 1.5 Base all in do I have 16 on minerals 6 on gas on 1 base and 8 on minerals, 3 on gas on the other base? Instead of a 3 gate Robo would I do a 5 Gate Robo since I have a bit more income, maybe get +1 attack, and attack when +1 finishes? Or am I way off the mark?"
allthingsprotoss,36fvv6,StacksOfRax,1 point,Tue May 19 04:20:57 2015 UTC,"1.5 base allin isnt strictly half income, by that I mean a build in which you do get your 2nd base and make a few probes until your timing hits, but you don't intend to fully saturate it. the old PvT 6 gate blink with ~11-12 probes at the natural is probably the best known example, zest's PvT proxy robo, macsed's PvZ 5 gate.  For a concept you're probably more familiar with, Zerg is probably the race with the most x.5 base allins, like speedling allin off 1.5 base, or 2.5 base roach bane allin - since Z is reactionary, it's relatively common to just stop making drones before full saturation if you see an opening and invest entirely into units."

allthingsprotoss,36dg5d,JdgeLearnedHand,3,Wed May 20 17:41:53 2015 UTC,"In my experience:   Full turtle is pretty bad in team games. If you defend, be sure at least one of you does a marine drop, oracle harass, or ling runby, asap, or even while you're defending. Don't ever cede 100% map control. Midgame synergies are much better than a late game doom army. This is less true on megahuge maps (see: old country) but usually, don't wait for late game tech like collosus, storm or ultras, a good synergy like stalker+hellion is incredibly strong if coördinated well. Whatever you do in a team game, do it 110%. Don't do a half-cheese, half macro, do a 3 hatch before pool or a 6pool. Cover your ally's weakness, or double up on cheese xor marco. 1-2 punches work very well. Hit the front with a ling baneling bust, and then drop dts in the back with a warp prism once the picnic has started. If you're the same race as your ally, doing something slightly different than your opponent is almost always better than carbon-copying their style. A goes terran ground mech, B should go skyterran. A goes dt cheese, B should do a warpgate cheese. A goes roach rush, B floods lings."

allthingsprotoss,36bp4g,4vengeance,2,Mon May 18 09:23:10 2015 UTC,It's an adaptation by me. I personally don't see a reason to not get a 3rd sentry since you have the time and gas to do it.

allthingsprotoss,36ddty,GGclass,3,Mon May 18 14:23:02 2015 UTC,"Except you're making one critical misassumption: that vikings beat nix.    They don't, nix are pretty cost effective against vikings, especially if you have a head start in making your nix (which you usually will).  There's always the risk that the terran will plonk down extra starports while you're on 1 or 2 stargates and just flood you out, but as long as you keep your nix production in like with his vikings, you should be golden."
allthingsprotoss,36ddty,Elcactus,1 point,Mon May 18 21:00:42 2015 UTC,"That also means you need to avoid getting stuck on cheap early game supply of gateway units in passive games, so you don't end in a situation where you can't keep up nix production because you're maxed out.   Also, a huge advantage of nix over vikings is their speed, meaning if you catch his vikings out of position he can't flee from you and you will usually kill everything for minimal losses.   You gotta be careful of randomly placed widow mines though, because two of them in quick succession can kill a handful of nix and with their speed, it's hard to fly out of range once you see them."
allthingsprotoss,36ddty,Kryptopsy,2,Tue May 19 20:05:44 2015 UTC,"well the goal is that you have enough colossi and phoenix so everything on the ground is melted before colossi die. If the Vikings attack the phoenix first the colossi will kill the ground army before they die. If the Viking focus the colossi all the Vikings should die and the colossi should still get some work done. Marines um kinda melt to colossi so that's not really a good option. The answer is a lot of Vikings (have seen people get a couple ghosts since phoenix do clump) or hitting timings. The phenoix colossi player will eventually usually try to add archons into his comp for some additional aoe on the Vikings as well (usually don't have time for storm and archons are usually fine since their only job is Viking killing). The plus sides of this comp is it should shut down any form of drop play and let you get some harass done. Also a lot of terrans generally don't know how to play against it so you can get an advantage that way. The downside is it generally isn't considered a stable comp, as you can see the style always only has short bursts of popularity in Korea until terrans remember how to kill it again (also maps play a big role in holding timings)."
allthingsprotoss,36ddty,willdrum4food27,3,Mon May 18 14:38:48 2015 UTC,"To just add to this a little bit:  On paper phoenix colossus itself doesn't really sound that good like with what OP said. One unit technically ""counters"" both the main units of your composition. However it's more what you do with your units that make the comp so good.  Phoenix colossus shouldn't just be used to sit on your ass doing nothing the whole game. That's obviously going to lose you the game. The huge benefit to phoenix/colossus is how well the early-mid game set up is and how it can push you to such a large advantage in the mid and then late game. If you can keep the phoenix a secret then the terran is more than likely going to try to drop you which is exactly what you want. Phoenix absolutely shut down drops. The thing that needs to be understood is that shutting down drops super hard really early leaves some huge widows open for you to do counter attacks. Once you shut down a big drop early on you instantly can move across the map and either straight kill them or pressure hard enough that it's very difficult for them to take a 3rd. Since you killed their medivacs early, they need to remake those to keep their bio alive which means that they can't produce enough vikings early on. This is the situation that gives you a huge lead going into the mid and late game. You put him on the back foot and snowball from there.  I personally don't like doing the huge balls off the walls phoenix colossus style with like 2 stargates and air upgrades and everything because at a point that becomes a little flimsy and I feel it doesn't take advantage of the early leads you can make with the comp. I transition into charge and storm once the 3rd base is up so that way you make the terran commit to vikings, but by the time they have enough to deal with your army you already have storm up as well so they're doubly fucked.  I've been going phoenix/colossus for a while now and still use it all the time and I win a lot of my PvTs with this style. Using it more as an early-mid game set up for an advantageous mid to late game instead of a composition for the entire game."

Generally, it doesn't work well, but is stellar against drop-heavy styles. Some maps have terrain that makes it very hard to stop drop play with regular defenses (6 stalkers, MSC), so people have tried phoenixes to some success.   Unless you are getting dropped into oblivion every game, the build is not worth it. It's cool too woop it out in clan wars every now and then, but for regular ladder it is not necessary to compete."

Your MMR has probably decreased a lot so you'll start of relatively easy.  What I like about it is that I can just have fun and not try to execute builds perfectly. My mechanics came back fairly fast and I now play in diamond (though I don't think I'm very high up). In my experience I win a lot of games in the mid to late game, if I survive the build that my opponent chose.  If you're not too interested in getting back into masters really fast I'd actually recommend just going for it and playing around, I really enjoy playing this way.  I'll probably start learning some builds soon to try and get back into masters, for that you can look at the build of the week archive in the sidebar."

They'll get some zerglings early on, a handful of roaches a bit later when I pressure, and then look for the green light to do a muta switch or maybe add some hydras, and then vipers...plus, holding their cheese builds just feels less exciting than holding PvT or PvP cheese, and the occasional loss after forgetting to put the zealot on hold position against mass speedlings never gets less annoying. /rant  Funny thing is I really love playing the same matchup from the Zerg side :P"

You should pretty much always go MSC before Stalker and WG. MSC right after you put down the nexus, then pylon > gas > WG > Stalker. There isn't really any point in getting the stalker before the MSC. The MSC will protect vs the reaper, will be out just in time for it and will start banking energy for PO asap."

allthingsprotoss,367xga,Gemini_19,1 point,Sun May 17 20:29:33 2015 UTC,"I've been playing since realise, but I'm trying to put myself into the shoes of these pros. The meta is so expand heavy, and oftentimes scouting is delayed, prevented or completely bypassed in order to get ahead. Why aren't openings such as nexus first or 1 gate expands punished when a properly executed 2 proxy or 3 rax is an auto win?"
allthingsprotoss,367xga,Gemini_19,2,Tue May 19 01:02:45 2015 UTC,Most pros scout in PvT. Only the super greedy ones don't.  Nexus first is very risky except on 4 player maps. Even then it's usually too high of a risk compared to the small reward you get. Reapers shut down nexus first too much.  Gate FE's however are 100% standard and normal and can react to anything. A simple 13 scout will give you all the information you could ever need. You simply don't go for the expand since you'll see that they're proxying when you get to their base.

I meant a FE Stargate that gets only one Oracle and transitions into Colossus Macro play.   The game that made me want to know is the Maru v Zest Proleague R3 Ace Match from last week.   Zest opened with Fe Stargate, got an oracle and went for a 2 base Colossus all in with no forges. So i'm wondering what time forges should be built (either one or two) in order to know what to scout for and when.   Maru did notice 6 gates and no forges at 9 minutes so i'm wondering if the gates or lack of forge is indicative of the all in or both.   THanks"
allthingsprotoss,3669gi,Dezib,1 point,Sat May 16 18:37:40 2015 UTC,"with this build theres not that many ways in which you can determine 100% whats happening. luckily for you, everything he can do can be countered by going for vikings after the first 2-4 medivacs and dropping early on.   he can go phoenixes and hide them, which will be really hard to scout, unless you drop him.  if he opens sg, a mine drop will automatically pay for itself no matter what.  if your drop sees phoenixes, take a third and make a 2nd starport for more vikings.   if you dont see any phoenixes, check for chrono on the robotics facility or for forges. chrono on the robo means allin, stay on 2 bases, make a bunker or two at the front and get vikings. consider leaving a marine behind his third.  if you see forges, expand. he's behind because oracles are expensive. you can also probably just scv-pull him, since he is lacking gas for 1.5 colossi/2 hts (you want to hit before hts anyways)"

I'd recommend scouting for proxy gates and cannon rush locations in pvp with a 13 scout.  When I scout for proxies I check the main and natural proxy spots and maybe have a look up the ramp at the 3rd on echo for instance.  Imo it is a much more effective scouting strategy for defending cheese because when you 9 scout your gateway is later than theirs even more than it would be.  Against a worker rush you just need to select all your workers and worker stack through them to the other edge of the mineral line and make sure all (or nearly all) of your workers can attack.

The no demotion thing is absolutely fucking the game up"

allthingsprotoss,361etk,willdrum4food27,1 point,Fri May 15 16:44:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think it fucks up the game so much as it is a misleading when you play someone in a certain league and they clearly don't belong there.   For me I keep hitting Masters league players that are for some reason in Platinum. When I see someone in a league lower than me I generally open up a bit more aggressive because it has a very high success rate but not when the player is actually of a higher skill than myself. It would certainly not be an issue if this happen only one or two times but I have hit a 10+ consecutive season masters player in plat more times than I can count this season.  That being said, I now assume that anytime I play anyone in plat they are really at least diamond and have changed my play style accordingly."
allthingsprotoss,361etk,aquanutz,1 point,Fri May 15 17:58:47 2015 UTC,"meh. The fact of it is, you are matched according to MMR no matter what their border is. So any increased success rate you feel with agro openings vs specific borders is more likely then not a placebo. Of course there is the 25 games new player thing that makes better players not get promoted until then, but they are still placing against equal MMR players (my smurf hit a GM in placement and only hit masters players after it while of course placing in plat, its not a very good smurf). So if you hit them on ladder, assume they are ~equal skill to you always. There is some exceptions with people passing through on fresh accounts, or dicking around in unranked, but no real reason to worry about that ;)."

I try playing toss without sentries but it's to difficult to keep yourself from getting flanked and surrounded with such slow units. Immortals just crawl around the map. It's probably even worse against Terran where stim into your face can pretty much end the game randomly whenever if you don't have sentries.

allthingsprotoss,35xz0j,BobbyAdamson,5,Thu May 14 18:53:51 2015 UTC,Here's my take: http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/17346936681?page=1#0
allthingsprotoss,35xz0j,SidusKnight,4,Thu May 14 13:32:41 2015 UTC,I agree with you completely. Starcraft has almost more abilities than WC3 units even though those were considerably harder to kill and the battles were so much slower. It's a little easier casting an ability on a unit that has 500 hp and most units will do like 10 damage a hit to it. Compared to how fast you can eviscerate a unit in SC2 before it can do anything.

allthingsprotoss,35xz0j,Dezib,-6,Mon May 18 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"... I sincerely hope you're trolling.  After I made masters as Zerg I started working on my protoss skills and the A-move potential is ridiculous. As toss, I'm just laughing at everything the opponent throws at me. Get deathball, a-move, win. It's the first step there that's kinda hard - actually getting the ball. But once the ball is there, you roflstomp everything."
allthingsprotoss,35xz0j,Krexington_III,9,Thu May 14 15:25:03 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what game your playing that vipers / vikings don't murder colossus based armys.   Coming into the protoss subreddit and saying all protoss does is A-move is probably an argument your going to not find a lot of people supporting.
allthingsprotoss,35xz0j,Dezib,-2,Thu May 14 15:35:37 2015 UTC,"...a game with high templars?  Yeah, I know that toss players are butthurt as fuck because their armies don't need control. It doesn't make it less true. Toss players instead need crisp builds and good defensive judgment. Toss players need decision making in very subtle details - zerg don't give a damn where we put our buildings, toss need to think base layout through on lots of levels.  The deathball does not need refined control. If you think it does, try getting into master league with one of the two other races - you will change your mind. Protoss demands other things of players than the other races do, is that so hard to come to terms with?"
allthingsprotoss,35xz0j,Dezib,1 point,Thu May 14 16:43:20 2015 UTC,"I'm a made masters as zerg the first season of HotS. I have probably around 2k games as zerg. I understand how the race works. Zerg is far more about making sure your rally points are good and to pre spread before fights then actually doing anything with the units during the fight. What kind of crazy micro can zerg even be doing? Are you playing like infestor, queen, muta, swarmhost, viper or some shit?  Your just stuck on the idea that just because half the time the toss can build a buttfuck of units so strong it doesn't even need to be microed that they never need to be microed. Yeah don't fight stalker, sentry, colossus with pure roach hydra. Toss can a move right through that shit. Don't try and throw armys that blow at fighting (muta ling) into slow units with poor harassment potential (toss units fight well.) The same thing happens in every matchup, oh the toss is still on gateway tech and the terran has stim? Push one button A-move in and vaporize everything. It's not a unique problem. It's just a lot more common for Toss to have an powerful lategame comp."
allthingsprotoss,35xz0j,A0G,0,Thu May 14 21:47:44 2015 UTC,"I see your point, and it is valid - except for the fact that Z has no deathball equivalent. What lategame comp can zerg bring to the table that can a-move through anything that toss can make?  Zerg units suck at fighting, period. That's why zerg need to do other things with their units than straight up fighting - don't you agree? Toss units, on the other hand ""fight well"" as you yourself point out. But not only that, they fight well when clumped into a ball - thus, without the need to be spread or managed in any way at all. Sure, if Z has broodlord viper, you might need to not fight and thus move your units back every now and then. But the toss lategame comps benefit in no way from spreading, flanks, concaves, or anything of the sort. Their preferred fighting formation is ""ball""."
allthingsprotoss,35xz0j,A0G,1 point,Fri May 15 12:33:48 2015 UTC,"The ball is about protecting the expensive tech units. Concaves are important as along as your not getting surrounded.   Zerg is about swarming with lots of units not protecting super expensive tech units most of the time. The zerg deathball of infestor broodlord corruptor was god for years it was very difficult to micro but it was extremely powerful and couldn't be fought directly. The deathball of swarmhost, spores, and vipers or whatever was somewhat deathbally in the way you could never attack it head on and it just slowly crawled at you. Did anyone think swarmhosts promoted much micro from the zerg besides don't let them go kill all your bases? I mean these comps aren't exactly the same as toss but I mean they are different races. Terran mech is pretty deathbally super gas intensive comp that neither race can attack directly into."

As well I should of been quicker with them force fields and maybe kept on making the immortals.

Easiest way to get a lead is just go for a fast nexus. DT cant punish it and will just be forced to be behind. Dt player only chance will be to try to play from behind or get back with DT drops. Hell DT cant punish nexus first even, so if you play on cactus you can really piss him off by doing that. As far as just outright killing him, dt robo can hold pretty much anything if it scouts it IMO but if denied scouting it can get trickier. Back when i did dt robo 90% of pvps I had a clanmate that was trying to figure out allins like that to kill me with very little success.

Whoops, mistake, that's easy to fix.  :)  You decide to go blink stalkers, what did you scout that made you decide to go robo and colossus against ling/muta?  Was this a conscious decision to go robo into colossus, or just a natural path you chose to take?  I'd highly suggest opening oracle.  The oracle is going to give you great scouting and early harass.  Even if you don't kill a single drone, the scouting you gain from the oracle is great, and thus it needs to stay alive.  The oracle really allows you to take a fast third if you'd like, given the scouting info you have plus the oracle's bug-zapping abilities if zerglings try to deny.  That's actually an ideal situation.  If zerg builds a bunch of zerglings to deny the third, and you zap them, that's larva that should've been drones.  So in a way, the oracle DID get a bunch of drone kills.  :)  From there, you can fast expand, go into robo, whatever it is you need to do.  You already have a stargate in case of mutas.  The oracle really allows you to scout constantly, casting revelation on zerg's force to keep constant tabs (this also typically discourages zerg from pushing, buying you time).    If you do decide on a fast third, focus on getting gateways made in front of the third.  Put HP up between zerg and the third to create a buffer (losing 2 gateways is FAR better than losing a nexus).  Lastly, always scout.  If you're not engaged with Zerg, you should be asking yourself ""what is Zerg making?""  Always scout zerg after an engagement, because Zerg has likely freed up supply and may look to tech swap into something that counters your army.  Staying on top of scouting is essential in PvZ.  Zerg typically will win a game if Protoss doesn't see a muta switch coming."
allthingsprotoss,35u2am,taomcdohl,1 point,Wed May 13 18:05:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I had been going Oracle, but someone recommended I try 3gate +1 with a lot of sentries to take my third, with forcefields/+1 Zealots you can take your third just as fast and you can scout with Hallucination. If I'm going Oracle, I still go up to 3 gates before the third, and use two gates to protect a cannon as I hold my third like I do with this build right? And I take my nat gases after the third/cannon/gates are put down, or do I get them faster going Oracle?   Let's just wipe away the forgotten blink. Whoops, mistake, that's easy to fix. :)   I had it by 8:10, thats too late? I don't think I forgot it, I might just need a faster Twilight.

allthingsprotoss,35rkwb,andrewrhodes_,2,Wed May 13 02:10:18 2015 UTC,I think he means scouting after gateway for like cheesy stuff. The sentry pushout is a scouting. Then he says to send 2 halluc to check if he's taking a fourth and what units he is making/tech he will choose. My pvz really improved once I started scouting after attacks.
allthingsprotoss,35rkwb,willdrum4food27,1 point,Wed May 13 04:19:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah like what the other person said, he's talking about looking for cheesey things or all ins or something. The build itself is so safe with the gateway walls and the zealot and the early sentries that you can hold basically anything with exactly what you're making and you don't need to make many adjustments. So you don't need to scout. After that though you want to scout with hallucinations to know if he's taking a 4th and what tech choice he's going for."
allthingsprotoss,35rkwb,andrewrhodes_,1 point,Wed May 13 17:45:07 2015 UTC,Yeah he definitely reinforces that scouting doesn't really matter because of the build.
allthingsprotoss,35rkwb,aihyur,2,Wed May 13 09:10:00 2015 UTC,hrm. Look at the timing. When would 3 base muta hit specially after some units being forced earlier. If its enough muta to be worried about you'll be at his front door with 9 gate blink before or as they pop. If its some silly 2 base muta you do scout for the 3rd. The way you get punished with this build is for not attacking. You have to know what you can attack into with this style in order for it to work.
allthingsprotoss,35rkwb,aihyur,1 point,Wed May 13 14:19:54 2015 UTC,The whole time my thought were on what to do if he's going straight for muta's and catch you out of position. MSC yes but he said that normally he doesn't make one..
allthingsprotoss,35rkwb,Graylien_Alien,1 point,Wed May 13 09:10:58 2015 UTC,"He said that normally he doesn't make a zealot, not MSC lol. If you don't make the MSC every push you make is an all-in because you can't recall, it's literally the only reason the 8:00 pressure works. No good player ever skips MSC in this matchup (or any matchup) and it's for a good reason ;)"
allthingsprotoss,35rkwb,LLLukeJ,1 point,Wed May 13 13:54:07 2015 UTC,"Mind you, 6 gases means HEAVY teching instead of units. Hence the 8:00 pressure kind of punishes that.  He can't have BOTH mutas counterattacking and enough roach hydra to deal with a 150/200 +2 blink stalker, mass sentry, immortal army killing off everything he has at 12:00.  The hallucinations scout for spire (spire is usually put down between 9:00 - 10:30 I think), in which case you would just go double stargate. And the ~8:00 moveout forces units from him to further delay mutas (if it would be mutas). And lings won't hold that third by themselves (ESPECIALLY if you keep warping in with a proxy pylon), you pretty much NEED roaches or hydras to deal with the push, so if he skips roaches/hydras to tech straight to mutas you would just kill his 3rd, queens and probes then recall before the spire even finishes.  Although mutas are VERY deadly if you mess up early game, like losing/heavily delaying your third, or losing all your units during the pressure."
allthingsprotoss,35rkwb,xabaddonx,1 point,Wed May 13 13:49:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like if that were me, I would've just gotten trashed by zerglings around the time that he was expanding."
allthingsprotoss,35rkwb,xabaddonx,1 point,Wed May 13 03:34:15 2015 UTC,"I've been doing this build in PvZ for the past few days. I love it. It feels a little dirty at first, but then I remember zergs have been wining with mass roaches for years and I feel less dirty."
allthingsprotoss,35rkwb,willdrum4food27,1 point,Wed May 13 09:23:15 2015 UTC,"I find the main thing that gives me problems is if they get alot of gas really fast and go for mass ling hydra. They are getting tons of hydra while I'm still making blink stalkers so I can't stop a fast 4th. I usually go for templar which can work but sometimes they outsupply me very badly so that I can't hold even with 3-4 storms, especially if they took a fast 3rd themselves.  Not sure if I should go for colossus instead of templar maybe? Would be more vulnerable to vipers though."
allthingsprotoss,35rkwb,xabaddonx,2,Thu May 14 20:05:21 2015 UTC,"I guess you would scout a fast lair and just push out? Make them pay?  Im not sure, i feel there is a 30 second window around 8:30-9:00 where the zerg goes from completely beatable to incredibly buff."
allthingsprotoss,35rkwb,willdrum4food27,1 point,Thu May 14 21:00:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I think it is probably something like you push out early with zealot sentry to force units / punish the fast 3rd a bit. Then push out again to force roaches / punish the fast lair (has to be before blink though I think). Then your immortals would be more effective and maybe you would be cost effective enough to hold.
allthingsprotoss,35rkwb,TrumpetSC2,2,Thu May 14 21:14:54 2015 UTC,"the little push out is nice, but to hold ling hydra you need solid micro and good positioning. FFs GS and blinks are key. If you try to respond with colossi at that timing, a viper follow up will be very hard to hold (still holdable if you scout it early and just cut colossi and stalkers to rush for HT (I like to squeeze out charge with this too) but going with tough). Blind immortals might also be delaying your storm, and you might be cowering from fights you can actually take, good upgrades blink sentry can kill a lot more hydra ling then you might believe."
allthingsprotoss,35rkwb,Artikash,1 point,Fri May 15 14:36:22 2015 UTC,What do you think about the skipping colossus and going straight for HT?
allthingsprotoss,35rkwb,MiddlingPenguin,2,Fri May 15 15:19:09 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you have the control for it its probably one of the best styles right now. With fast SH out of the mix and really fast viper timings being fairly popular it becomes a very solid option. Its a very different army to control and might take some getting used to. By default its strong against ultras so you just got to keep an eye out for muta and broods, and keep pressure on the map."
allthingsprotoss,35rkwb,andrewrhodes_,1 point,Fri May 15 15:37:59 2015 UTC,This was really good for about a month but most zergs can swat away this style now. Its a good thing to mix in though!

allthingsprotoss,35q4tq,zaiah7800,16,Tue May 12 16:22:58 2015 UTC,"you need to select 2 templar (of either kind, mix and match if you like) and then hit the archon button/hotkey.  a single templar or dark templar can't become an archon, it's a fusion between two of them, resulting in a tier 3 unit.  I don't know if you were hung up trying to find what building they come from or couldnt figure out why the button was unavailable in the unit card, but it's likely that you didn't have more than one templar unit selected if that's the case."

For supply even without range and even in an a-move phoenix will wreck Void-Rays.  If you add in just move command microing and/or the range upgrade the phoenix win in a landslide.  Which I believe is what the guy is suggesting as a new player, everything is basically a-move.  Of course if you add in storm and splash and lots of other units it becomes more complicated but, again, new player.  Its an option to start that is simple."
allthingsprotoss,35p56k,AnthroGame,2,Tue May 12 14:55:14 2015 UTC,"While the void ray player is low league, remember the phoenix player is too and babysitting phoenix micro like that for as long as required to kill mass void rays is ill advised and ineffective compared to storm/archons."
allthingsprotoss,35p56k,Gemini_19,1 point,Tue May 12 17:56:48 2015 UTC,"I agree that mass phoenix isn't the best play but if your opponent is literally only building voidrays, a low level player may have trouble actually engaging with a ground army if the other guy just flies around.  Mass Phoenix beat Mass Voidrays even in an A-move, without any micro from the Phoenix player.  So fi the opponent is literally just building voids, Phoenix is probably easier than storm for a new player.  EDIT:  So I mean if they're both just massing largely one unit and not really micro-ing (just a-move) the Phoenix will win."

allthingsprotoss,35nhqr,OyHereWeGoAgain,5,Mon May 11 23:15:13 2015 UTC,"I  really love 2v2 so I'll give it a shot. Take what I have to say with a grain of salt because 1) I'm only Plat (been stuck at Plat for 5 seasons), and 2) I usually play Toss-Toss in 2v2 with my brother. Playing double Zerg is our worst nightmare.   First things first, you need a build. Yes, it's not 1v1 and there is a lot more to consider, but not at our level and it's just as important to be crisp. At first I thought, ""oh nice, he's going FFE."" Then I was like, ""BAD ASS, he's going NEXUS FIRST!"" And finally I said to myself... ""What the flying F*** is my man MalReynold doing? Is he high?"" :) To nitpick, your opening should be so tight that a probe lays your first pylon at 100 minerals, not a second later, and PARTICULARLY not 50+ minerals later. Then you need to know if you're going gate expand or forge expand against ze zergs. If you aren't doing either of those two things, then you should be hitting with 2-3 gates and tech with the understanding that you're all-inning, or will have a very difficult time if you don't do some damage to your opponent's economy. I've found that in lower league 2v2's there are a lot of 1 base shenanigans. Your early scout should help you in those situations. Otherwise, I might recommend that you work out a strategy with your partner once you know the races that you're up against for the opening of the game. For instance, you could have FFE'd and had a cannon and wall at the front of the base to ward off ling all-ins and the like while your zerg friend expanded early.  When I play Toss-Toss with my brother one of us typically goes air and the other goes ground. Sometimes I will play greedy (nexus first) while my brother 4-gates, or goes 3-gate immo. If your partner wants to go ling-bane you're susceptible to air, so I might consider going something like Rain's 4-gate Phoenix pressure to assist your zerg friend in the early fight. Personally, I love this CJ Hero 4-gate warp prism into blink-immo build, and you can adapt these builds for better 2v2 play. With the CJ Hero build, you could hit with your 4-gate warp prism at their natural while your partner knocks on the door (baba-dook-dook-dook) with his ling-bane army.   Regardless, you will never go pylon-pylon-forge-3 cannons-gate. NEVER EVER! Particularly when you see that they aren't pressuring early. And I think in the initial stages, if you can execute a solid build that coordinates somewhat with your partner's and then hit TOGETHER, you will find success.   Other tips: your phoenix control isn't bad! You had a great moment in the game when you spotted an approaching ling army and pinged your partner to notify him of the impending shit-storm heading to your Third. Nice! Your micro was also fine in the battles you engaged in, but had you had a solid opener (that included some sents for hallucinated scouting and FFs) you could have easily held that third. I hate playing zerg, but scouting often with hallucinations helps even the game against an opponent that tries to tech switch, and force fields are your friend when holding a third. Also, if you're committing to phoenix early, I think you really should invest in range ASAP. Particularly when you know those muta are coming.   In sum: 1) You need a build to use as a guideline. None of that mass cannon before expand stuff, friend.  2) Try to coordinate your build around what your opponent is doing. If your opponent is going to go ground ling-bane, then try out a build that scouts and harasses with an early oracle into phoenix, or the Rain build I linked above, which I think could be deadly with an early 2 base attack from your zerg partner.  3) You need to scout with hallucinations to catch when zerg goes muta. Yes, you had phoenix and that was the right response, but it looked like it was a blind move, not a direct response to what you had scouted.  4) The rest will fall in place once you have a general plan and a build.   Lot of thoughts here. Hope they're helpful."

Yeah I open weird vs ling because ive been burned too many times by ling runby. to be fair those phoenix were a direct response to me seeing a spire or a muta pop, one or the other. I was floating a lot of mind mid game, you're right. We try to coordinate our attacks but I kinda went full retard. Here's a game where we did better at teamwork/micro/macro. Granted I got fucked early game but you can at least see our dynamic a little better."
allthingsprotoss,35nhqr,Spqrhawkz,1 point,Wed May 13 01:11:58 2015 UTC,"Me and friend used to be top 10 in masters 2v2 (a year or two ago, we havent really played much recently)  we almost always played random+random unless there was a particular strat we wanted that game.  2v2 is all about hyper aggressive builds and all-ins, and protoss is imo the weakest race in 2v2. Against double zerg taking and holding expansions is very hard, they can just pull you around too much and stop you from being able to defend.  You would probably be better off going for builds based off of 1 base toss and 2 base zerg that combo together quite nicely. 2 base ling bling with 3 or 4 gate stalkers (maybe with blink), 2 base roach with 5 gate +1 zealots, pure zergling with gas dump into zealot archon. And then look to expand later after either doing damage or establishing a lot of map control.  One last thing is that despite being ""the counter"" to mutas, phoenix arent THAT good. mass blink stalker sentry archon and storm is a lot more versatile and doesn't require as much micro. with phoenix you will end up having to constantly micro them, so much so that even pro players don't have the time to macro while micro-ing them to their full potential"
allthingsprotoss,35nhqr,Kluyasufoya,1 point,Tue May 12 07:22:08 2015 UTC,"no you need phnx, as protoss in 2v2 you need either phnx or blink + cols 100% of the time for any two base play.

allthingsprotoss,35ml52,avengaar,0,Sat May 16 16:24:21 2015 UTC,"I think so. It is probably because there was no /s tag and it is via text. You are also giving a sarcastic answer to somebody who obvi doesn't know much about the game, and starcraft fans tend to hate false info being spread lol"
allthingsprotoss,35p5as,Solid_Snoop,2,Tue May 12 11:03:18 2015 UTC,"On a serious note, regular 13-gate with proper placement of pylon and gate is more effective against 6-pool than any type of forge."
allthingsprotoss,35kl3w,iceman1212,9,Mon May 11 06:44:12 2015 UTC,"Ok so i'm watching the replay as I write this so I'll just write down stuff as I see it.  Your macro early game was pretty solid except you should have made earlier tech(robo bay/twilight/forges)  instead of all those gateways, you can hold off a lot of terran pushes with the nexus cannon and gateway units off 1-3 gates.  14 minutes and no 3rd yet, could expand earlier.  Use halluc phoenix to scout tech/expands, you have plenty of energy for it.  REALLY late forges.  Your vision with obs was really nice :) edit: but you had like 15 at the end of the game which is a bit too many, probably don't wanna get more than 5.  First engagement was really bad, never blink stalkers aggressively forward like that unless you know you have the fight won. Try and spread your units out before an engagement and have the zealots at the front to soak up the damage. Faster upgrades from your forge would have really helped for this fight as well.  4k unspent resources after this fight as well, but you have plenty of gateways to spend it which is good :) but try not to let it get that high, 4k is kinda crazy haha.  Fight at 27 minutes: your zealots all clump up and bug out at the choke of the supply depots and they aren't attacking, basically being useless, you should pull back here, don't fight in chokes with zealots. Also you have +3 armour which is nice but 0 attack upgrades which is bad, your archons are dealing hardly any damage to his units. You wanna get 2 forges in PvT to keep up with the double eng bays that terrans usually get or rotate between getting armour and attack upgrades, you can't completely neglect one or the other.  So the last fight you lose simply because you don't have any aoe damage, he was all clumped up, one storm would have rekt him and he didn't have any vikings either to counter collosi.  Sorry if its a bit scattered or comes off as overly critical, your macro is definitely above average for a silver leaguer but obviously has some room for improvement, just some decision making and poor engagements that lost you the game. There was also probably a lot of stuff I missed, hopefully a better player than me can fill in anything I missed or correct me on anything I may have said wrong. If you have any questions, hit me up :)"
allthingsprotoss,35kl3w,VB_Enthusiast,5,Mon May 11 12:03:29 2015 UTC,"This + your army composition was really bad against with what the Terran had, with 15 obs you should have had the info.   if the Terran goes for a maraudeur + tank compo, you could either :   add another robo and pump some immortals  add a stargate and a fleet beacon and get some tempest, keep out of range and snipe units, with your stalkers zoning out vikings   stalkers and colossus are not beefy enough to get in close with this terran composition.  But the main point is to spend your money, even with a bad composition if you have way more stuff that the Terran you can win this game decisively  also, you are not the worst protoss in the world."
allthingsprotoss,35kl3w,Mackguy,3,Mon May 11 12:37:00 2015 UTC,with 15 obs you should have had the info.   Just skimming through this thread and I see this.  LOL  Don't go over like 4. The rest should be pylons scouting. 15 supply in observers is so much wasted army.
allthingsprotoss,35kl3w,Gemini_19,1 point,Mon May 11 16:57:49 2015 UTC,"yeah, i realize now i was incorrect in the OP when i said that the # of observers probably didn't have an effect.  3 more immortals in my army would've gone a long way against his marauder and mech-heavy unit comp...  p.s. your youtube coaching videos (""started from the bottom..."") are awesome, esp. for learning PvP!"
allthingsprotoss,35kl3w,Infestor,1 point,Mon May 11 18:46:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for watching my reply, much appreciated.  I agree re: immortals.  Not making immortals was one of my biggest regrets, second only to not taking my natural gases on time (since that delayed my tech by 3+ minutes).  Re: Tempests - would the best use have been to pick off the siege tanks (and, eventually, Thors) from a safe distance?  I ask bc I have never made a Fleet Beacon (let alone a Tempest) in my 150 or so ladder games as Protoss (lol) so not sure how they are meant to be used in this match-up.  Re: spending money - tbh, I felt like I didn't have enough money for most of the game.  Aside from the short period of time when I was maxed on supply (which is what led to me banking a lot of money, almost 4k minerals), I felt like I kept my money decently low, no?  I could be wrong - I will rewatch replay.  I agree though that I did not play very decisively (bc of how I chose to engage in virtually every battle)   also, you are not the worst protoss in the world.   it really did feel that way last night as I was reviewing post-game stats - but it's good to have things to work on for my next game. thanks =)"
allthingsprotoss,35kl3w,somerandomtoss,2,Mon May 11 18:42:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reviewing replay and giving feedback - the more criticism, the better =)   you should have made earlier tech(robo bay/twilight/forges) instead of all those gateways, you can hold off a lot of terran pushes with the nexus cannon and gateway units off 1-3 gates.    This was a macro fail on my part - I took my two gases at the natural too late and, as such, I didn't have the right mineral-to-gas ratio to go for an earlier robo bay/twilight/forge (I usually like to put down robo bay at 6:30 so I can have 2 colo by 9:30 or so, with the help of chrono).  Since I ended up floating minerals, I just decided to dump them into warpgate infrastructure that I'd have to build eventually anyways...  I agree though, having more tech sooner would've helped me out in the engagements...    14 minutes and no 3rd yet, could expand earlier.    I would have loved to be able to take my 3rd by 10:00-11:00 or so but I chose to pump the brakes bc the Terran took his natural so late that I felt I couldn't defend 3 bases if he were to do multi-drops (off his 2-bases) at 11:00-12:00.  Is this flawed thinking?  (I didn't know at the time that my opponent wasn't prone to multi-drops.)  In other words, is it safe for the Protoss to set the pace of expansion in PvT?    you had like 15 [observers] at the end of the game which is a bit too many, probably don't wanna get more than 5.    lol, yeah, i agree, the protoss department of homeland security probably went overboard this time around =P    First engagement was really bad, never blink stalkers aggressively forward like that unless you know you have the fight won. Try and spread your units out before an engagement and have the zealots at the front to soak up the damage.    I rewatched it and I see what you mean.  In my paranoia to protect my colossi, I blinked my stalkers ahead for quicker access to his vikings - but in doing so, I blinked them ahead of my zealots, so the stalkers took the brunt of the DPS from the Terran army, which, ironically, likely resulted in me losing the colossi more quickly (bc they were my only anti-air).  Seems like the lessons here are: (i) let the zealots always act as the meatshield, and (ii) don't blink stalkers forward unless I know that the battle is decently in my favor.    4k unspent resources after this fight as well    Yeah, I started banking resources bc I was maxed prior to the fight.    Fight at 27 minutes...    I had nightmares about this battle last night =P.  Makes sense re: not engaging in choke with melee units and the fact that weapons upgrades would have served me well.  Would you have used a different unit comp for rebuilding army (instead of zealot/archon)?  Namely, would you have started adding immortals at this point?   I really felt foolish rewatching the replay and realizing I didn't make a single immortal all game against his marauder and mech-heavy army.    But thanks again for taking the time to write out your thoughts, very helpful.    It's ironic that I started out playing Terran (on a different account) but then decided to try out Protoss bc I bought into the stereotype that little-to-no micro was required in late game (which would let me continue to focus on macro).    I know for a fact that I never once lost a game in which (i) I made only MMM (no vikings) and (ii) in which I out-macroed my opponent.   That said, I'm not going to switch back as I find Protoss a lot more fun to play (bc they have so many unique/specialist units many of which have interesting abilities/upgrades)"
allthingsprotoss,35kl3w,sage_006,1 point,Mon May 11 18:30:11 2015 UTC,I'd rather have 0/3 than 1/2
allthingsprotoss,35kl3w,sage_006,3,Wed May 13 16:32:42 2015 UTC,"1st don't read in to generally accepted, cause it is a blunt lie most of the time.  2nd can't watch you game as I am at work, but if you are double his supply in workers, and have a lot of observers, in max army engagements you will suffer a lot, as your army supply is 40-50 supply less. The goal is to build as big army as you can with your better economy, and attack as you hit max, then you should be able to win him easily, but even if he manages to hold your remax would be much faster and stronger on the back of stronger economy."
allthingsprotoss,35kl3w,HazMatt082,2,Mon May 11 11:04:04 2015 UTC,"What people are saying here is pretty much on point. Just wanna add a couple things:  ALWAYS keep at least 1-2 pylons at your expansions. The power of protoss is to warp in wherever. The first fight when you lost your third, a warp in of zealots in front of the terran army as your main army with the collosus came in from the back would have been much much more effective. Sandwich him and get more surface area out of your zealots.   Why only 1 robo at the beginning? I love collosus/stalker in the early mid game but you have to out produce his vikings. You had the economy and the unit comp was fine but you got your second robo bay much much too late. You stayed in your base until you had 4-5 collosus, which is the right choice, but was 3 minutes too late. If you wanna go collosus from the start, double up the robo bay and hit him with 5 collosus before he can make the 10+ vikings he would need to properly counter it.   Then... why stop with the collosus? I assume because you saw the vikings. But you took about most of the in the engagement. 2-3 collosus with your zealot/archon would have made a big difference.   Micro your collosus, if his bio ball pushed forward to snipe them, walk them the fuck back. Meanwhile your zealots are tearing him a new asshole. I always keep my collosus on a separate control group  for just this reason.   People already mentioned this, but upgrades. Great that you had +3 armor. 3 armour zealots don't die. But they are nothing more than cannon fodder unless they are doing damage. Zealots do 2 attacks so attack upgrades are important too. If you really only want to go 1 forge (which with your economy is a strange choice) go to +2 armor then get to +1 weapons, then +3 armor then hit up weapons.   As most people said. You macro is fine for silver. A few little tweeks and you would have rekt him. Heed all the other things these guys have said. You definately have the skill to implement almost all of them without too much trouble.   Wasn't a bad game though at all. I fucking hate terran also... :P"

It seems I've incorrectly assumed up until now that I can't afford to constantly produce out of 2 robos (in addition to my warp-gates) off a 2-base economy.  I will try this out    You stayed in your base until you had 4-5 collosus, which is the right choice, but was 3 minutes too late.    Yeah, forgetting to take the gas at my natural set back my tech path by a couple minutes - I should have def had these colo sooner    Then... why stop with the collosus?  * In game, I decided to stop making colo after the first engagement bc I thought that colo wouldn't add much against a marauder/tank-heavy unit comp (given the results fo the first engagement).  But I agree - if the zealots/archons are tanking up front, then the Colo can dish out a lot of damage from a safe distance.  Micro your collosus, if his bio ball pushed forward to snipe them, walk them the fuck back...I always keep my collosus on a separate control group for just this reason.    LOL, it seems so obvious, yet for some reason I didn't do it during the battle (I think I may have been overly focused on taking out the vikings that I didn't realize that the bio did just as much, if not more, damage to the colo).  Lesson learned.  Also, can I ask what control groups you use for typical PvT armies?  Your comment re: keeping colo on a separate hotkey was rly helpful and I'm curious how you set up management of the rest of your army.    ALWAYS keep at least 1-2 pylons at your expansions. The power of protoss is to warp in wherever. The first fight when you lost your third, a warp in of zealots in front of the terran army as your main army with the collosus came in from the back would have been much much more effective. Sandwich him and get more surface area out of your zealots.    In this game, I thought it would be a bit suicidal to try to defend my 3rd with a warp-in while he was attacking it, only because he had so many tanks/marauders.  Flawed thinking?  At the time, I thought it would be better to sacrifice my third and give myself 2 warp-ins worth of an army before trying to take out the rest of his army.  I agree though re: the usefulness of having pylons at all expos      You definately have the skill to implement almost all of them without too much trouble.   Much appreciated =).  I'm definitely going to focus on the things listed by you and the other good samaritans in this thread"
allthingsprotoss,35kl3w,ameya2693,1 point,Mon May 11 19:08:13 2015 UTC,"I rewatched that battle when you lost your 3rd. It's true, a warp in right as they attacked would have been a bit futile. On a side note, however, you should have run your probes. In any case, your archons got stuck on a clump of zealots when you moved in, as well as the 2nd wave a zealots getting stuck behind the archons. A pylon on the other side of the terran army would have solved both those problems.   Another thing quickly about the fist engagement, don't stand in siege tank fire!! Taking 1-2 volleys isn't the end of the world, but the reason you lost your army is cuz you stood there eating all the siege tank shots, as soon as you zealots are dead, back up!! You would have killed all the vikings and had 1-2 collosus up instead of losing everything I think. So again, micro back :P  As far as my control groups go... I don't understand the common protoss mentality of dead ball, 1 control group, A-click. I always keep zealots separate and collosus separte. Zealots on 1, stalkers/immortals/sentries/VRs (if i have them mixed in) on 2, collosus on 3. That way you can send your zealots in to do their meat-shield/kicking ass and taking names thing, while blink micro/scoot and shoot with your stalkers/ranged units without your zealots dancing back and forth uselessly. Collosus on 3 allows me to micro my collosus back while the rest of my units keep attacking.   In any case it's all a learning curve. Keep it up mate. Just remember to keep having fun! It's the point of a game. ;)"

Have the stalkers focus on killing whatever comes out of the factory. You can even use nexus cannon if you want.
allthingsprotoss,35jhlt,halcyonmechanic,2,Mon May 11 04:16:04 2015 UTC,"You don't have to stop the landing, it's likely you won't manage to stop it from happening. Just chrnoboost stalkers, make a robo as soon as possible and get an observer.  If you do that well, the terran will only manage to have one shot of his mine and since you'll have see that coming you'll lose only one probe or two."
allthingsprotoss,35jhlt,tomve,1 point,Mon May 11 08:13:13 2015 UTC,"This is the way to go. You have to notice the factory before the first mine finishes, but if you focus the widow mines as they come out, you usually can force them to burrow before they make it to your precious probe line.  Otherwise, remember you can choose what dies to the widow mines- put a single sacrificial worker right above the mine, or remember your msc can survive a widow mine shot if she has full health."

allthingsprotoss,35jhlt,jibbodahibbo,1 point,Mon May 11 02:55:07 2015 UTC,Well in order for them to land the factory they also have to be paying attention to the factory and not macro. You just need to be faster.
allthingsprotoss,35jhlt,AmnesiA_sc,1 point,Mon May 11 03:20:12 2015 UTC,i remember thinking exactly what i needed to do (macro and stop the factory) but couldn't seem to do it. macro? factory lands im dead. focus on probe? the result above with failed macro. Here it wasn't a big deal and I won anyway but someone could get a free win by patrolling a proxy factory in random spots around my base.
allthingsprotoss,35jhlt,silverchloride,1 point,Mon May 11 04:27:48 2015 UTC,"First thing is that you should have an idea of when a proxy factory is coming. If you send a probe out on 13 to scout and it sees 100 gas already mined and you don't see a factory starting in base, it's most likely a proxy factory. As soon as I scout 100 gas mined I send a probe or 2 to proxy factory locations and can usually kill the scv as it's building the factory and then you're WAY ahead.  If they do finish the factory just get a couple of units out and kill the annoying factory. If you're playing super greedy and don't have gateway units, send 4 probes over to work on the factory until gateway units get out. If a widow mine pops out of the factory, try to kill it with the probes; as soon as it starts to burrow, send your probes back to mine. He then has to unburrow it and send it to your mineral line; there's absolutely no reason to not have at least 1 stalker out by this point with detection at least close enough to finishing that even if you have to evacuate your main it's not a big deal."

Works up to low-mid masters because opponents think it's blink, and react terribly. Opening is similar to 3-stalker PvP opening, and I put down nexust at 24 supply, and don't make 4th and 5th stalker. I use the money to put down forge and TC instead. Also, there is no need to chrono stalkers or warp, so all chrono is on probes. 3 stalkers make it to terran's ramp the moment earliest medivac leaves the base with mines, so 90% of the time they stay back to defend, and bunker up cuz they think it's a blink all-in.   Back home I safely tech up, and have an option to get DT's (which I sometimes do, but straight storm is better). I then get a hidden 3rd and place a robo. The result is:   1) Terran has super delayed natural and allowed me to get to 3 bases just with 3 stalkers and 2 gates  2) Terran loses to surprise DT's   3) Terran says ""fuck it"" and a-moves with marauder-mine across the map, and I lose."

allthingsprotoss,35jpn0,Ozy-dead,1 point,Tue May 12 12:32:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but the scouting is hard for T in this case. Reaper is usually dead (because it flies right into stalker + MSC and dies). Smart terrans scan my natural and see a nexus, but they are still blind about TC tech. Dumb terrans scan my main, see a TC, and still think it's blink. And the funny thing is - if T doesn't react (like, i don't see anti-blink reaction with my initial 3-stalker poke), I might as well make it a blink all-in :)"

allthingsprotoss,35gcab,iismathwizard,1 point,Sun May 10 09:36:20 2015 UTC,Ok thanks is there any reason why its better
allthingsprotoss,35gcab,vetiton,2,Sun May 10 13:13:08 2015 UTC,"It's more flexible play. 4 gate is pretty all-in, and helps practice a narrow range of skills, whereas 3 gate robo feeds nicely into a wide range of builds: from sentry immortal all-ins to super macro colossus deathballs.  Honestly, it doesn't really matter too much, you can win with either. However, mastering 3 gate robo probably demonstrates a wider range of ability than learning to 4 gate every game."
allthingsprotoss,35gcab,Brad1nator2211,0,Mon May 11 19:04:12 2015 UTC,"I do both, 4 gate with robo proxy but thats just me"
allthingsprotoss,35fsxb,zaiah7800,3,Sat May 9 22:57:44 2015 UTC,"up till 3ish you were doing pretty fine!  -when your gate finishes you immediately start a zealot and then wait for the money for a core? why? you've already got a probe scouting, why do you need the zealot?  -so you finished the zealot it sees the scouting probe and it gets one hit off. but you let it go. you know it's in your natural. not a big deal just a little strange.   -he sees your first proxy pylon so he knows pressure is coming. still not a big deal hes operating off just two barracks.  -7ish minutes. his scv knows you haven't taken your natural. he's taken his. (still operating off two rax so still not a huge deal.) the BIG deal here is that you're floating 1k min and 200 gas at this time. this is not great as you could've gotten both tech and your natural started by now.   -still no supply blocks! woohoo!  -9 minutes! 15 supply up from terran with map control! alright! (he's still going off two barracks)  -12 minutes: you gave up your map control to try and push up a ramp in which you had no high ground vision. 2 stalkers were shooting and the rest were just getting picked off as they weren't even in attack range thanks to that ramp. you lost a fight you should have won because of positioning.   1245: you've cut probes again. you're floating 1.2k minerals and are operating on 4 gates, no tech, almost no army, no gases at the natural.  15: you've seen widow mines. your stalker pressure has to go home. you have no detection, a stargate coming in, 2.6k minerals.  17 min: triple void ray production vs marine mine heavy army? (im actually just happy you're spending money right now :D )  19: ah yes the standard mass voidray style. hey that's great that it worked. against a more competent terran who would just make some marines and it'd be gg.   20-39: i think the terran lost the game himself...oh god I can't watch this anymore.  so as a bronze that was great! almost no supply blocks at all! early pressure! NICE!   take your fights more carefully. remember that mass voidray doesn't work unless the terran builds like...no marines. and be more active with your forces. and build probes. don't cut probes unless you have a darn good reason not to."

allthingsprotoss,35cj2l,JBroms,4,Sat May 9 00:12:18 2015 UTC,I have no idea how a ground composition deals with lurkers. Pretty much only zerg unit at the moment where I just cannot figure out a solution. Games that I have won involved zealot and adept counter attacks and drops while transitioning into carriers.
allthingsprotoss,35cj2l,Rinehart_sc2,3,Sat May 9 10:02:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm surprised you're seeing lurkers over ravagers.    Is it straight up lurkers?  What's the comp you're seeing?  You can treat lurkers like a cloaked siege tank.  Blink stalkers work pretty well in that scenario, you just need obs.  So either you go stargate and grab an oracle into blink, or you maybe open TC into robo.    Lurkers are pretty far down the path, compared to ravagers, so being aggressive vs a Zerg going lurkers isn't a bad way to go.  Perhaps you can open TC and go for a blink stalker push, then into robo. Forcing units will delay the lurker tech."
allthingsprotoss,35cj2l,taomcdohl,2,Sat May 9 04:05:43 2015 UTC,"Ravagers tend to be more of a problem early game, in my experience. As long as you're on top of your scouting Ravagers aren't a huge deal. Generally, it's roach-hydra-lurker, vipers later on. It's particularly annoying because hydras will just pop your observer(s) during the fight if at all possible. I suppose being aggressive isn't a bad idea. I've been going for a harass and macro style with a warp prism and a couple adepts."
allthingsprotoss,35cj2l,1android1dev,1 point,Sat May 9 04:38:37 2015 UTC,"dont forget that you can tag units now, right? Like, sniping obs isnt a thing anymore because new oracle?"
allthingsprotoss,35cj2l,avengaar,1 point,Mon May 11 04:28:53 2015 UTC,I've found ravengers to be really pretty unimpressive right now. I don't think they are anywhere as good as lurkers.  I think blink stalker theoretically is always good against any comp but if you ever let the zerg move across the map and have lurkers burrow you have to try and base race.  It's very hard to keep track of the zerg army once they have lots of detection and hydras. Also there is no way on the ground to break well positioned lurkers with hydras ability to kill obs and their huge range unless your army costs an extreme amount more than the zergs.
allthingsprotoss,35cj2l,pureatheisttroll,1 point,Mon May 11 14:42:01 2015 UTC,"CARRIERS.  I open robo or stargate, and as I take a third I harass with a warp prism and/or immortals to delay any attack.  I'll get two disruptors and go up to +2 attack, but before 10 minutes I put down two stargates, start +1 air attack/shields, and get ready for Carrier production.  I've had a lot of success with this, but there's obviously a few minutes before the carriers get out where you're vulnerable.  I haven't tried it, but Tempests/Disintegration might be useful for breaking lurker sieges.  If I defend my third, then I run around the map, drop interceptors, and recall."

allthingsprotoss,35cj2l,staticZA,1 point,Sat May 9 17:05:32 2015 UTC,"I treat them kinda like the old SH, just never engage them directly. Have warp prisms flying around, pull the zerg out of position and slowly widdle him down. It's either that or switch to skytoss, currently there is nothing protoss has on the ground that can come close to beating the lurker head on."
allthingsprotoss,35cj2l,Ozy-dead,1 point,Sun May 10 13:31:55 2015 UTC,"Carriers. No, seriously, take any HoTS build, but replace robo + bay with stargate + beacon, and make carriers instead of coloss. You may want your gases #3 and #4 slightly earlier though.   I've been doing stargate and skytoss PvZ builds in LoTV, and it's looking great. Oracle mines are amazing at defending 3rd, and VR hard-counter any early ravager push attempts. Don't forget to add storm in the very late game when on 6+ gases to combat corruptors and vipers though."

allthingsprotoss,35cvrd,avengaar,1 point,Sat May 9 04:44:26 2015 UTC,I take a 17 nexus first against T and Z 95% of games.    Zerg can sort of punish it with an early pool but whatever it's a pretty risky guess from them. I usually skip the forge against zerg for a while as well. I think ling pressure is somewhat viable but rare.  Terran will annoy you with reapers for a while if they scout you right away. But idk usually I might lose a probe or two but usually that means their reaper(s) die for it.    I like to pump out immortal adept sentry for the early game in most matchups now and see if I can put pressure on as it is strong against traditional comps from each race baring weird banshee or like fast muta play.
allthingsprotoss,35c7bu,rorosama,3,Fri May 8 22:22:36 2015 UTC,"Phoenixes are the hardest counter to mutas that protosses have. That said, if you especially want to all in, blink builds shouldn't lose to early mutas."
allthingsprotoss,35c7bu,LLLukeJ,1 point,Fri May 8 23:17:55 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not really looking for hard counters or anything, just something that'll make sure I don't die to like 10 mutas. Phoenix play is fun, sometimes, but usually I prefer pressure builds/all-ins. Are there any that incorporate phoenix play? Or is there an alternative of any kind (aside from blink all ins) that'll make sure I don't die to mutas?  Cheers for the post."
allthingsprotoss,35c7bu,LLLukeJ,1 point,Fri May 8 23:31:34 2015 UTC,"I guess some old chargelot archon all ins would work against muta openings, but then you'd likely lose to roach/hydra. I don't know of any PvZ all ins that use phoenixes, but a 7- or 8-gate should hit when your opponent has very few mutas, so you should be able to overwhelm pretty easily."
allthingsprotoss,35c7bu,Carbon234,3,Sat May 9 08:16:20 2015 UTC,"Typically it's all about the 8:15 hallucination scout. If you open with just 1gate fe into 3 gates and a forge, you can take your third with just a handful of sentries and like 3 zealots around 7:30. Lair finishes around 8 minutes if they've taken a reasonable timed third. So as I move to take my third I put down a twilight. From the scout you can see if they're doing some silly fast muta play and just choose either double SG or 4 more gates and chronoing your blink for a big all in.  I only ever do the blink all in if I really think the opponent is bad or if I know there is a clear sneaky path to get my army across and pylon down."

allthingsprotoss,35c7bu,taomcdohl,1 point,Sat May 9 19:42:24 2015 UTC,"Opening stargate is actually one of the more versatile openings you can do.  You can be aggressive, you can take a fast third, you can do whatever you want.  A robo or TC opening will more or less pidgeon-hole you into aggression.  With stargate, you go for the oracle and you NEED to keep it alive.  Not only do you get some nice early harass, but you now have endless scouting.  You will see exactly what he is doing, his units, etc.  Use revelation on his roach/hydra and you'll have constant tabs on him, and zerg will feel delayed.  Take a fast third and use the oracle to help defend vs zerglings.  Quick spire?  You already have the stargate.    That all said, you two several options: open stargate and go phoenix, attack him before mutas are out, use blink stalkers to defend until you can get phoenix."

allthingsprotoss,355lhf,skipv5,2,Thu May 7 12:38:53 2015 UTC,I always though that directly hurting their economy (Killing drones) was the best way to go?
allthingsprotoss,355lhf,ChrosOnolotos,2,Thu May 7 16:05:16 2015 UTC,Killing drones is better since you slow down their mining and force them to waste larvae on drones to catch up on eco. Killing 2 birds with 1 stone.  If their drones are well protected by spores then I guess killing larvae is the second best bet? Not too sure. But you do only get 1/2 the benefit (if not less) by killing larvae instead of drones.
allthingsprotoss,355lhf,Andrroid,1 point,Thu May 7 12:59:29 2015 UTC,One shotting larvae means not staying around for spore shots. You could also potentially pick larvae safely off if they are far enough away from the spore.  Killing larvae also means no army/reinforcements being built.
allthingsprotoss,355lhf,Gemini_19,4,Thu May 7 14:41:14 2015 UTC,Also no extra drones.
allthingsprotoss,355lhf,omgBBQpizza,1 point,Thu May 7 13:10:53 2015 UTC,I had a fun game recently. I went 2 oracle against 3 hatch. He pulled his drones to his main. I killed a few drones and a shitload of larvae and he just GG'd.
allthingsprotoss,355lhf,willdrum4food27,1 point,Thu May 7 14:39:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, usually spore cover the larva depending on map spawns. But if they don't go for it. Obviously if youre careful with your micro you can go for gas workers and what not instead. You wont really need revelation for a while so saving the energy on your first oracle isn't worth it imo (until lotv)."
allthingsprotoss,355lhf,hopefulFLIPPER,1 point,Thu May 7 15:16:34 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, I guess this makes it favorable for the zerg to spawn in bottom positions of symmetrical maps, so the larva is closer to the spore(s).  Probably one of the very few cases where position is relevant on symmetrical maps."
allthingsprotoss,355lhf,PinkHaro,1 point,Thu May 7 15:44:21 2015 UTC,"I used to snipe larva a bunch of times long-ish time ago. The only way this really impacts the game is when you go for a timing right afterwards. In that situation, killing larva is equal to killing their army. If you aren't going for a timing attack, it's better to save the energy and try to pick off transferring drones or for the other abilities.  Edit: This is also good to weaken their timing attacks as well but these situations are much rarer."
allthingsprotoss,355lhf,Kluyasufoya,1 point,Thu May 7 21:53:07 2015 UTC,Do you guys find using the oracle to reavl + kill creep spread is useful?  im torn between the micro it takes vs the annoyance it poses to the zerg
allthingsprotoss,355lhf,Dymix,0,Fri May 8 15:22:16 2015 UTC,"Well, you would kill larva that would (most likely) be turned to drones eventually. Why not just kill the drone instead?  If the zerg has evacuated the base, then I see the idea in sniping larva."
allthingsprotoss,355lhf,xenon_228,3,Fri May 8 21:59:42 2015 UTC,"dude, read the topic name. The most important part of this question is ""if he has spores?"""
allthingsprotoss,357gnn,rorosama,2,Thu May 7 19:09:30 2015 UTC,"so the big difference between zerg and toss is with toss build orders are actually important. Build order like those in the build of the week archive on the sidebar, have built in timings to scout for and hold random shit from the other races.   So take a look in there. As far as toss macro goes, you don't need to constantly build shit from gateways. Easy way to start is follow the gateway counts from builds, keep constant upgrades, teching, and robo production, then you can spend the left over cash on gate units. It can get more complicated then all that, but that comes from experience ;)."
allthingsprotoss,357gnn,willdrum4food27,1 point,Thu May 7 20:01:47 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the post.  So I have to follow builds to the T? Like EXACTLY? Wow that's really constrictive if so, it feels especially weird considering Zerg was just a freestyle, pretty much. You'd have an opening, and gas timings and that was it.  I've been struggling with teching up properly, and in time. When are some good times to get Storm/Collosus in PvZ/PvT. Also is PvP just cheese? Are there such things as Macro PvP? I've been proxy 2 gated/DT Rushed/Proxy Gate-2 Stalker Rushed almost every PvP I've played."
allthingsprotoss,357gnn,willdrum4food27,2,Fri May 8 00:57:57 2015 UTC,"following builds is pretty much your starting point. Yes you can tech things in based on scouting, but early mid game toss has a lot to do with hitting crisp timings, and you need a build in order to hit them. PvZ and PvT techs are highlighted in the builds. PvZ doesnt always get colossi, and doesnt always get storm. Its a very reactive matchup in the late game. PvT generally you open colossi and get storm after like 3 build pending.   PvP is a lot of macro. Higher level pvp goes into midgame and late game a lot. Bad players like to cheese because its easier."
allthingsprotoss,357gnn,Anthony356,1 point,Fri May 8 01:13:08 2015 UTC,"There are two things i want to point out really quick, then when i get back to my comp i'll edit in more.   Gas is SUUUPPPEEERR important. It's as important, all game long, as zerg gas when they're going mutas or whatever. Learn where you can and can't spend gas in your builds because it's definitely what you'll be short on most of the time. despite what everyone circlejerks about, controlling the protoss army takes a lot of skill and precision. Work on your FF's and blinks as well as tabbing through your unts to use all of your abilities quickly and efficiently. The protoss army isnt like zerg or terran armies in this sense: if you're not looking at your Z or T army and someone attacks it, you just back up and build more stuff. With protoss if you aren't paying attention at the wrong time for just one second you can lose the game. Zerglings are ontop of your immortals, vikings get shots on your colossus, gg game's over in a flash. Because you were busy macroing for 1 second."
allthingsprotoss,355nnp,phraust64,2,Thu May 7 08:59:18 2015 UTC,"FFE is not really feasible in PvP, as you are not able to be aggressive for quite a long time and cannons are not as good against stalkers as they are against zerglings.  PvZ is the only matchup where you can go for a FFE. Again, you are not able to be really aggressive here, but you could cannon rush his third, if he builds it too early.  Your other option is the Gateway Expansion:  http://imbabuilds.com/hots-protoss/hots-pvz/pvz-naniwas-gate-expand-opener/  Your expansion is a bit later, but you can pressure with 4 or 5 gateways without too much of a risk to keep the zerg from saturating his third.  This opener is also the standard build against terran, although you should not pressure in that matchup. Take a robo around 5:00 and you should be safe against widow mines and early bio pushes.  PvP is different, as you can not take an early expansion without being punished. I would recommend the 3 stalker rush that you seem to have encountered already. It provides you with early map control that you can use to deny proxy pylons/stargates, while also allowing you to pressure your opponent a bit, if you scout a ridicilously fast expansion."
allthingsprotoss,355nnp,TTumbeNuss,1 point,Thu May 7 09:45:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input! It really helped shine a light on the matchups and yeah that's true, I feel like I would be behind tech wise if I FFE vs P.    I haven't seen the gate expand opener so that's something I'll be looking into more, ty for the link and the tip about widows, I always have trouble with widow drops and I'm hoping that knowing to drop a robo at 5m mark would help me out there as I usually drop one really late (when they're already widow dropping)  PvP is something that I really have to work on more, it's my worst matchup and I typically stop scouting after the initial first probe, which is probably a bad thing because initial probe only really reveals so much ( 2gas, 1 gate etc ) so I'll be more mindful to scout more."
allthingsprotoss,355nnp,burn78,1 point,Thu May 7 11:09:44 2015 UTC,When you scout with your initial probe you should keep it alive and stay in his base to see if you can see him put down his tech or force him to make a msc and delay his tech for 30 seconds while he takes care of your scout.
allthingsprotoss,356v73,zestFanboy,1 point,Thu May 7 16:27:12 2015 UTC,"If it's drops killing you, leaving a cannon, 1 high templar and a couple of off-cooldown gateways to warp in is usually enough.

allthingsprotoss,356v73,Flanq,1 point,Thu May 7 16:35:04 2015 UTC,"How many gates do you often get if you play chargelot archon style? Also, do you add some immortals into the mix too? And do you think storm is worth getting early vs this mass marauders style?"
allthingsprotoss,356v73,LLLukeJ,2,Thu May 7 16:40:08 2015 UTC,4 gates per base is a good general rule of thumb.
allthingsprotoss,356v73,Flanq,1 point,Fri May 8 10:51:04 2015 UTC,4 per base is good but honestly with chargelot/archon getting like 14 on 3 base is okay if you're macro can be a bit iffy.

I did leave some cannons to protect my buildings in the main but the thing is, if the medivacs can survive to drop those marauders, my cannon will just melt so fast. Also, i'm just plat so my multitasking is not that good. The terrans often engage my army in the front and then use 2 medivacs to drop in each of my base. I can almost always push them back with my main army but by the time that happens, their drops could have done so much damage and the next pushes will just kill me."

allthingsprotoss,356zwm,Gemini_19,5,Thu May 7 17:23:47 2015 UTC,"grats you have no idea how to play protoss, and that's fine and dandy :). I cant think of a 4 immortal push that exists in any machup, and immortal pushes in general tend to be fairly allin but w/e :). You could start by actually learning real builds. The botw archive on the sidebar has some great builds to choose from. As far as transitioning into the late game, that has to do more with scouting reacting and your target comps. PvT and PvP have idea target comps that you can go for with minimal scouting while PvZ you have to know your opponents tech somewhat going into late game."
allthingsprotoss,356zwm,willdrum4food27,5,Thu May 7 17:33:46 2015 UTC,"You expand AFTER you put down 3 gate and a robo?  I think you might as well call it an all-in.

allthingsprotoss,356zwm,iceman1212,1 point,Fri May 8 02:20:51 2015 UTC,3 gate Robo is pretty much all in. At high levels it is an in. At low levels you can transition out if you do damage. You should probably be pushing after the second immortal rather than the 4th.  Without a replay this is guessing.

allthingsprotoss,352i44,Kryptopsy,5,Wed May 6 15:41:29 2015 UTC,I veto that map. But if I have to play it for clanwar/tourney and what not I take the far one not with the rocks. The rocked off 3rd is hardto hold with 2 entrances with LoS blockers and the fact the enemy army can wedge itself between your nat and 3rd. The farther base you can kill the collapsible rocks can delay pushes or limit their attack path to the easier route. You just gotta keep an eye on the back rocks.   hell a lot of the times I end up not taking that rocked off base until my 5th base lol.
allthingsprotoss,352i44,willdrum4food27,1 point,Wed May 6 17:43:29 2015 UTC,"same on all accounts - my third is typically the base that's adjacent to the natural (i.e., not the one through the destructible rocks from the main) and my fourth is adjacent to the third (i.e., the corner base).  imo, it's too easy for the opponent to stumble upon the base next to the rocks without intending to scout for bases.  also, given production/research facilities are in the main, i like to keep the rocks up."

allthingsprotoss,34ymi0,iceman1212,3,Tue May 5 17:21:48 2015 UTC,"Why do you need to get a forge after 1 gate FE??  A) 1 gate FE  - you build a gate and then start a zealot...but cancel the zealot at the last moment if you don't see any lings around. Then you are safe to expand and start your mothership. Once mothership is done, there is no way he can snipe anything at your base. If you see more lings than a mothership can handle, obviously start making zealots. But it's pretty hard for zerg to be ahead in this sittuation.   B) Once your expansion is warping in, start making a wall of gateways at the natural. Forge at that point is needed for upgrades, unless you would like to expand again, then canons definentely are of use. But if you are sitting on two bases, you can totally defend anything he throws at you with just gates. If you see an all-in coming - make canons as needed.    No, don't wall off the ramp. If anything happens you just hinder your mobility from natural to main. The only exception is if you do an all-in. Then wall it off in case he counterattacks and you'll need to sack the natural and defend your main.  No. ALWAYS cancel the zealot, unless early pool is incoming. If you don't see any lings by the time the zealot is almost made, cancel it for the expansion. At that point even if lings are showing up in the next 10 seconds after zealot is done (indication of 9-10 pool), your mothership is already on its way and will kill them. You might need to run with your probes a bit. NO. Don't even look at it, unless you don't see it for like 10 seconds straight. Then send a probe to investigate if he's making a hatchery or something. If he's trying to block the natural, just send the second probe."

(it was recommended to me, along with a macro-style blink-colossus build in PvT and 3-gate/robo in PvP)"
allthingsprotoss,34ymi0,VELL1,1 point,Tue May 5 19:32:44 2015 UTC,"I watched the replay, so I see what you were going for.   So that build leaves you vulnerable to those speedlings runbys at the beginning. I thought your opening was pretty solid, all of the pylons at the right time and so on. However, you don't need to chase that drone with your mothership. Also, if you are doing this risky build, leave a probe outside of his base, so you'd know if he's sending lings your way. But before you started the overcharge the situation was salvageable. You should have transfered all probes to your main and put a zealot in between mineral line and let him take as many lings as possible + mothership core would clean up the rest."

allthingsprotoss,34wpy0,Attica_Sc,1 point,Wed May 6 20:41:56 2015 UTC,When you realize it's a bio opening you can move out with the stalkers and kite them till they get to your base.  You should have 3 gates and blink before the attack. Just warp in and use po. It's very important  to run probes if he commits to the attack.
allthingsprotoss,34wpy0,Moonlawl,1 point,Wed May 6 22:47:32 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok. What if they go concussive shells before stim? How important is it to kite the bio before it hits the base?"
allthingsprotoss,34wpy0,Attica_Sc,1 point,Wed May 6 22:52:51 2015 UTC,You need to make the read. An early marauder means he delayed stim. The conc shells timing also hits earlier. Don't let the marauder hit the stalker and it's an easy hold.

allthingsprotoss,34wpy0,iceman1212,2,Wed May 6 21:44:50 2015 UTC,This one is very different. You start with Twilight council before Robo (not just the bay!). It heavly helps you against drop play and should give you an option to hold 3rax attacks.  If they go for a 10min push it gives you the option to be agressive until they have Medivacs and then delays the attack until collosus are ready too.
allthingsprotoss,34wpy0,Radiokopf,2,Thu May 7 05:58:10 2015 UTC,"Obviously this build does hold it, but what do you do vs gas first widow mine play. Either drops or reactor mines?  Or do you just get a faster robo in that situation?"
allthingsprotoss,34wpy0,BrianTTU,2,Tue May 5 11:42:40 2015 UTC,"Personally I pay attention to the clock at around 7:25 - 8:00 you need to be on your toes and paying attention for drops like widowmines, and if you see it fast enough, pull away probes and let one die until you can get fast enough observer."

A few other things that have really helped me against them is having a warp prism to do zealot drops. Void rays are slow so if he is out of position you can get some damage done. This can also buy you time if he is moving out and you are not quite ready yet.

allthingsprotoss,34skvl,KOUJIROFRAU,4,Mon May 4 07:54:50 2015 UTC,"Instead of a 4 gate, I'd say a 3 gate robo or 3 gate stargate is better. Easier transition and not nearly as all in-ish as 4 gate is (even though it's not that all in)"
allthingsprotoss,34skvl,Drundolf,2,Mon May 4 12:55:22 2015 UTC,"I think 4 gate is the simplest ""complete"" build that protoss has in the arsenal; gate-gas-core opening, early game scouting, single tech (warpgate), timing-dependent chrono, proxy pylon placement, warp cycles, and even a little gateway unit micro. It's not the strongest build in 2015, but it does introduce everything a good build order has with the fewest ingredients possible.  I agree that 3 gate + tech builds are definitely better, but the tech adds an extra and unncessary element that's not easy to keep up with for bronze/silver caliber players, or players brand new to learning and memorizing build orders."
allthingsprotoss,34skvl,KOUJIROFRAU,1 point,Mon May 4 16:33:58 2015 UTC,"eh its the whole argument of doing something shit to get success faster, or doing something mildly reasonable and getting success a tad slower. I see both sides of the argument, but frankly its long past the time where 4 GATE TO GOLD, was the golden standard."
allthingsprotoss,34skvl,willdrum4food27,1 point,Mon May 4 16:51:15 2015 UTC,"It is not about being promoted as fast as possible. The 4Gate is the easiest 1Base-Allin that Protoss has and is ideal to practice the basics of macro and micro. When he is able to warp in units and build pylons reasonably fast, he is able to move on to macro buils, regardless of his league."
allthingsprotoss,34skvl,TTumbeNuss,1 point,Mon May 4 17:08:49 2015 UTC,"never said anything about macro builds. 4 gate is a bad build. I started playing in copper league and have done a lot of coaching and in my experience I don't like the 4 gate approach to learning protoss and find it can create early skill plateaus. That's pretty much that.  Don't sit here and try to convince me otherwise like I don't understand it's merits. The plus side of 4 gate is it gets you winning right away, and winning is a good way to keep people interested."
allthingsprotoss,34skvl,willdrum4food27,1 point,Mon May 4 17:15:49 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile a 3 gate robo can be played as either an all in or just as an opening. Immortals and stalkers in combo should have you set in the mirror for the early game, a few observers will be awesome in all matchups but especially vs zerg and a tech to colossus will just decimate marines and marauders, a standard strategy in all levels of play, especially up to gold or so. If you're having a very long game, transitioning into storm will be awesome and maybe you can even throw in some tempests or something.  The build can tech into almost anything and I like it over a 3 gate stargate because there are times when your opponent has like 10 vikings and pretty much anything from a stargate will die but robo is great because, at the very least, observers stay relevant at all points in a game."
allthingsprotoss,34skvl,Drundolf,1 point,Mon May 4 17:32:31 2015 UTC,"though I am of the opinion that 4 gate execution can carry a player all the way to diamond, I definitely don't suggest that most people stick with it for too long. As soon as a player is merely able to remember the correct order of buildings and units in a 4 gate and starts to be skill capped by probe stacking, building timing sharpness, chrono chaining, and microing, I think that player is going to have no trouble learning any build order they desire, because they already have the rhythm of producing probes constantly and unconsciously while placing buildings and managing research/production. I've taught friends 3 gate robo only to find out that they can't even remember to produce probes while looking away from the game, at a build order skeleton, trying to get the buildings and supply lining up...from that perspective I advise new players to keep it as simple as possible. In an ideal world everyone should start with 3 gate robo but it's honestly overwhelming for many new players."

allthingsprotoss,34skvl,KOUJIROFRAU,1 point,Mon May 4 22:24:54 2015 UTC,"i agree with the suggestion of 4-gate bc it encompasses the various protoss mechanics, as KOUKIROFRAU nicely pointed out (as well as planned usage of chronoboost).    that said, it's important to know when to move on to builds that involve having 2+ bases.  i would say it's time to progress to more complicated build(s) once you're able to consistently do a 4-gate build in which you finish warp-gate by 5:30-5:45 and have your army in your opponent's base by the 6:00 minute mark.    once you're able to achieve these 4-gate benchmarks for 3-4 ladder games in a row, you're probably ready to move on to something more complicated (I wouldn't count AI or custom games)"
allthingsprotoss,34skvl,iceman1212,2,Mon May 4 17:49:11 2015 UTC,"One absolutely huge thing in bronze for me would be don't care if you win or lose. If you get cheesed/ blind countered/ mess up with micro etc... and it causes you to lose a game, dont care. Your metric for success shouldnt be ""did i win or lose"" but ""did i have 45 probes at 8:00 which i know is what i should be able to have while still getting my robo started at 6:15"" It might be a little dry and not the most fun way to improve at first, but its probably one of the quickest. FilterSC's bronze to masters series, whilst being outdated WoL builds showcases the mentality of how to improve quickly and efficiently.  For PvZ i would say that the infamous Parting Soul Train, despite being a mainly WoL build will still be super strong (i use and win with variations on it in diamond). Look at some of the VoD's listed at the bottom of the page and look at the timings that the pro players hit for their buildings/units/probe count. Aim to execute the build in the same amount of time as the pros. It will be hard to do (i still dont have perfect excecution 100% of the time) but looking at and analysing why you didnt hit the timing will allow you to focus your efforts on improving.  http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/7_Gate_Immortal_All-In_(vs._Zerg)  If you play on EU and want to discuss builds/play practice games etc feel free to message me, i love talking starcraft"

It won't hurt to try some 4 gates first to get a feel for toss though.
allthingsprotoss,34q494,blinkSCV,2,Sun May 3 19:22:47 2015 UTC,"As a fellow new Protoss, I wonder if there are variations of the 4 gate or is there an agreed-upon best build?"
allthingsprotoss,34q494,ckax,1 point,Sun May 3 21:05:08 2015 UTC,"well, it isnt a 4gate, but the 10gate 3gate can be very effective especially if it goes unscouted."

allthingsprotoss,34q494,Spqrhawkz,0,Mon May 4 16:57:29 2015 UTC,"4gate has a specific build order, always follow it it's the quickest way! Google it it'll come up :) but remember 4gate is a cheese so you'll never get the hang of the macro and meta of protoss if you only practice 4gate, and once you get to plat you'll find it never works! Also it's situational - eg if terran wall in then it's useless! You can't macro out of it either as it's an all in so if it fails you've lost - it's still strong though :)"

Anyway the aggressive builds that you mentioned aren't too hard to execute the builds themselves but they take a lot of practice to be able to know how to micro them correctly, explaining how to micro is kind of hard :P  vs Zerg I like going FFE, into DTs, into +2 blink stalkers.

Even if they have to make them so that they require zealot archon and cant fight alone I would be happy.   Speaking of Zealot Archon gateway armies, here is an idea that i liked: Their cost is begging for them to be good with DT archons because 600/300 would get you an archon, a zealot, and 2 adepts. That means 2400/1200 would get you 4 archons, 4 zealots, and 8 adepts.

allthingsprotoss,34ngqm,MilExo,4,Sat May 2 22:13:20 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with Gemini here. If you go for a 4-gate all-in and it fails,  you are probably behind in economy, tech and army. Unless you gain a significant advantage in at least one of these areas, it means that it is your opponents' game to lose.   As you have mentioned already, you will just get out macroed. Your options for getting into the game is to go DTs (which everyone should expect), or do something crazy like double expand or mass voidrays and hope that they don't attack you for a while.   As a general note, 4 gate is pretty much dead and can be easily countered. I even do a gas steal to force opponents into 4 gate because of the easy win. You need to rather go for 3 or 5 stalker pressure if you want something to transition out off."

allthingsprotoss,34lrqx,Kluyasufoya,2,Tue May 5 16:08:42 2015 UTC,Storm is also very effective as VR tend to clump.
allthingsprotoss,34lrqx,knowone752,2,Sat May 2 08:31:08 2015 UTC,"This. If your opponent is making several voidrays, storm will wreck them. Some archons are nice as well, but 2-3 archons won't help nearly as much as 4-6 high templars or so. You can easily spam storm like a mad man to bring voidrays down to less than 50% of their total hp, then immediately morph those high templars into archons to help you in the battle.  Of course, you still need some anti-air to finish off the voidrays, so a few archons will help, especially if they voidraays are still clumped. Blink stalkers also do fine if you already have them - that is to say, I wouldn't recommend teching to blink as a response to voidrays per se. All in all, you'll need some form of anti-air to kill the voidrays as storm will most likely not be enough to take them down, even though it deals severe damage to them.  By the way, if it gets to the late game, a handful of tempests can also wreck voidrays if you have storm support. It's a great combination because you zone out the other player with tempests, and when he tries to attack you can easily storm the voidrays. It gives you a massive positioning advantage... like, it's so massive I don't even think you can mess it up to be honest."

You had around the same mineral income, you just didn't have much gas.  It's your build order that downright sucks.  I mean I watched it to 15 minutes. YOU HADN'T BUILT THE WARP GATE RESEARCH UNTIL THIS TIME.  You also start a robo around 14 minutes, which is about 8 minutes too late.  Instead of building stalkers to fend off the oracle you build like 5 cannons. 1 per mineral line is enough.  The first building you made was a forge, but you didn't make any upgrades.  You need a solid build order. Your game is all over the place  Ofc there are some basic stuff like constant probe production (especially after getting harassed as successfully as you got) and chrono boost, which will need improvement, but it's not why you lost."
allthingsprotoss,34kht8,NeverGrown,1 point,Sat May 2 08:04:32 2015 UTC,Most of the problem is that you didn't react very well to that oracle harass and never really had the economy to build a bigger army.  Your opponent was economically ahead of you for a very long time after that oracle slaughtered half your probes and when you finally did bring in more income it didn't really matter because his army slaughtered yours and there's no coming back from the losses your took there.

allthingsprotoss,34erbu,illmatika,3,Thu Apr 30 15:26:15 2015 UTC,If you see them mining gas on your initial scout then know that a speedling opening is likely.  1gate expand isn't newfriend friendly vs. Speedling
allthingsprotoss,34erbu,stormsmcgee,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:28:37 2015 UTC,"so, what should i do against that order? ffe? i scouted 13 supply,   when i see gas(or not), at this time is 16~17 supply without gas."
allthingsprotoss,34erbu,vhapteR,2,Thu Apr 30 23:49:40 2015 UTC,"There's a set of specific reactions depending on what you scout.  Against a 14-14 opener, you can just get a zealot out, wall your natural with a cybercore and a forge after your nexus, and then add a cannon and get a msc. I don't recall if you have to delay your second gas to do that though, but I think you do.   Against earlier pools with speed, you can wall your main ramp and gateway expand instead. Having 2 pylons with a hex in between them for the zealot (or a pylon and a gate, or cybercore, etc) allows you to position your zealot in a way that only 1 ling can hit it. Pretty useful imo. You'll have to go double gas if you want to get your msc out asap, so you can't play as if you were going 1 gas msc expand. Early pools may require you to stay on 16/18 to get your zealot out asap and build a pylon asap. If you're on 17/18 when you spot the speedlings, you may need to kill one of your probes if the zergings don't target your scouting probe.  However, I didn't see a single speedling-related issue in any of the replays though. The title doesn't really make much sense to me tbh."
allthingsprotoss,34erbu,NeverGrown,2,Fri May 1 00:43:33 2015 UTC,"as for the 3rd game, you lost due to the economy.  Oracles didn't kill drones even worth their own price - He was still ahead of you in workers after they've done what they could. I don't know why you tried to kill that spore crawler and didn't move to the main/3rd with the oracle to get more kills O.o. Then again I am a platy scrub  Super late third, which eventually leads him to overwhelm you.11 mins  2nd game: Poor decicionmaking?  If you saw that many lings (90) why didn't you make zealots, which are that much more superior vs lings?  You don't seem to like cannons. That's a shame, cause zergs like doing these annoying ~15 ling counterattacks when you move out. Sentries alone don't pack the firepower to kill the lings fast enough."

allthingsprotoss,34gred,iceman1212,3,Fri May 1 00:40:07 2015 UTC,"When you're trying to defend your third in PvT against bio + vikings, force fields can help you prevent the bio from kiting. That means your colossi can actually do damage instead of dying without killing any units.   Also, most pros seem to spam guardian shields when dealing with scv pulls (3 sentries usually). It's also pretty common to hide behind one of your nexi in that situation so that your nexus tanks some of the damage. Picking off wandering vikings unprotected by bio with blink stalkers is pretty key too, but I guess that's not exactly what you were talking about so I'll leave it at that."

allthingsprotoss,34gred,Dahktor_P,2,Fri May 1 06:21:42 2015 UTC,"As a new player you don't need to be worrying really about having super up to date builds. Just making sure the build was designed for HoTs is enough.   As for your question about PvT, most ""standard"" builds are either 2 base all-ins or defensive macro styles, there really isn't much middle ground. This is because marine marauder medivac compositions are incredibly mobile and trade well with small groups of protoss units. This makes defending a drop at home difficult while also applying pressure to your opponent.   Thats all well and good for higher level players, but luckily for you none of that matters! For your level just focusing on constantly making workers, keeping yourself from being supply blocked, and keeping your money low is enough!   Try this build. It's a 2 base colossus all in that hits a very strong timing before vikings can feasibly be out for the terran. If you aren't able to kill your opponent just take a third and start making probes again. Most likely your opponent won't know the proper way to respond and you'll be able to go into a normal game.   Sentries are great in pretty much all situations. In every match up you want to have at least 2 or 3 of them with your main army at all times. Hallucination on it's own is enough to make sentries vital for every matchup on its own, regardless of guardian shield or force-field.   Force fields though are probably the most important spell however. In PvT you use them to keep bio from being able to kite and to keep the opponent from moving through a choke point. They are incredibly usefull but aren't the game deciding units that they are in pvz.  Sentries and Force-field in PvZ are probably the most important unit to have in the early and mid game, and are usefull throughout the late game. Because of the zerg larva mechanic, zerg is able to produce units more quickly than protoss will ever be able to match. In this situation the protoss has to use forcefield to break the zerg army into pieces and engage them one at a time, this allows the smaller protoss to trade incredibly efficiently with the larger zerg army. Watch how parting does it and do your best to emulate that, you won't ever be able to truly match him (most likely) but he's pretty much the best in the world when it comes to force fields."
allthingsprotoss,34gred,Dahktor_P,1 point,Fri May 1 04:35:49 2015 UTC,"yeah, i agree, i'm not too worried about being up to date on the meta.    i wrote this post in part bc i spent some time practicing a build which turned out to be from WoL...pre warpgate nerf, lol.    i'll give the 2-base colossus one a shot.    regarding sentries and FF usage - that makes sense.  it'll def take some practice for me to drop semi-competent FFs while in the heat of battle.  but it's awesome having all these abilities/spells to play around with.  very different from the terran / zerg early/mid-game which in my limited experience seem to require a lot less micro.

allthingsprotoss,34gred,theColonelsc2,1 point,Fri May 1 06:26:46 2015 UTC,about the 2-base colossus play - i took a closer look.  a question - it's building toward a 9:30 push with 2 colossi and stalkers/sentries - should thermal lance be done by the time we reach the Terran base?  i think the answer is yes because otherwise our force doesn't do well against 20 marines / 2 marauders / 2 medivacs and stim which is what he'd have if he went for 1 rax FE into 2 more rax
allthingsprotoss,34egia,avengaar,2,Thu Apr 30 14:04:14 2015 UTC,"if its gold first, unless you opened forge I don't know of a way to punish it. If its a gold 3rd, gateway pressure can still break that. You can try to go for plays that will abuse the spread apart base locations like stargate gate combinations, but yeah. Don't really have a good consistent solution myself, gold bases are dumb. You can always just play from behind, gold bases aren't actually double income since they have less patches, but they are a notable income bump with a lower worker requirement. They also do mine out faster."
allthingsprotoss,34egia,willdrum4food27,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:30:25 2015 UTC,Zergs tend to flood roach ling until your dead if you let them it seems like. They don't really let the gold run out in my experience.
allthingsprotoss,34egia,willdrum4food27,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:43:06 2015 UTC,"well then you gotta play it safe and slow, no real other way to go about it. Take a slow 3rd off the back of some stargate harass. Or just open forge every game. I guess you have the option of going gate forge, if you scout the gold after a gate expand and might be able to get a cannon rush off at the gold but yeah. Best bet on that one would be on expedition I think."
allthingsprotoss,34egia,DarkblueRH,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:51:41 2015 UTC,Really depends on the map too though.  Gold first on Vaani I don't think you can do anything besides cannon rush or play from behind.  Way too much open space to cross before you can be threatening.  On Expedition Lost I think gate-nexus builds can toss chrono'd zealots and MSC out at the hatch to trade really well while going for a 3rd.  Gotta watch for Z busting the rocks to your main though.
allthingsprotoss,34egia,colin13,2,Thu Apr 30 20:03:55 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on it as a diamond player: you see it a lot in pro games in order to create a timing with roach, lings, or in some rare cases hydras as well. The gold bases mine out faster and are more exposed. If the zerg doesn't aim for a timing then it's almost a disadvantage. A lot of players don't realize this.   So in my opinion, when a zerg takes a gold base, you should prepare to defend a timing with a ton of gateways, blink, and maybe a robo for detection. If no timing attack comes, drop your third and you should be able to attack and win."

I'm plat btw so I'm sure that makes a difference with how they are being used and controlled.   If I scout them early enough I still freak out a little but my reaction is changing. I've played a couple games where zerg has tried to use them like the old siege units with supporting hydras and corruptor/viper but without constant waves of locusts it just doesn't have the same effect and I was able to find a timing to push and win fairly easily.   I've also played a couple games where SH were used as a harass unit, and this is where they seem to shine and I still don't know how to react properly. They will get 5 or 6 SH maybe, and run up to my third or nat depending on map, bust out a wave of locusts and then hustle back to safety while my nexus gets shredded.   I feel like this is a much more efficient use and requires me to get better map vision and constantly scout in order to keep track of them. At the same time it's a risky maneuver and if the SH hosts aren't placed well or aren't able to make a quick escape then there's a lot of lost resources.   TL;DR: I think as a harass unit they are still viable and a threat, but against a full deathball they are not the power unit they once were."

The standard practice for zerg was to fight the protoss for their third, and once the protoss got their third, use swarmhosts to staff until the map ran out of resources.   When playing zerg, I used to specifically try to end the game by denying the protoss a third.

allthingsprotoss,34a24c,TheCrypticFox,-1,Thu Apr 30 07:33:26 2015 UTC,I do think the mass stalker builds your seeing top level pros is extremely difficult. If the zerg gets their army in a position near your bases you might just die. The toss needs a lot of space to kite across the map and force the zerg to endlessly back off due to poor engagements. If you at any point don't see a big flank you lose the game instantly. It's just playing on a narrow edge of relying on your micro for 15 minutes as you grind the zerg down.
allthingsprotoss,34a24c,Analtoast,2,Thu Apr 30 13:52:18 2015 UTC,As Zerg I haven't used them although I have some thoughts on how to incorporate them.  As Protoss they're extinct.

allthingsprotoss,34a24c,biedrik,5,Thu Apr 30 11:14:21 2015 UTC,"I don't see them too much. Broodlords are much more prevalent then they used to be with the tempest change. They are starting to appear some in progames, and the way ladder works more or less is ladder heros copying pro builds, so as we see more pros bringing out SH I suspect it to eventually spill into ladder. Regardless, the old skill floor of SH was waaaay to high, and SH turtle games were just boring, so even if other changes do have to be made balance wise (either way, for all we know new SH might be secret OP when people figure them out) any change from old SH is a good change."

allthingsprotoss,349cws,halcyonmechanic,7,Wed Apr 29 09:51:54 2015 UTC,"There are basically two varieties of this as far as I can see depending on your opening.   You go gateway expand: This should favor you. You chrono out a zealot and build a pylon. Send the zealot and some probes (3-6 depending on how long the hatchery has been building) and try to kill it before it finishes.  You go nexus first: Build a cannon, preferably so it both defends your wall and can shoot at the hatchery. Then send probes to kill it while the cannon warps in. Might need more probes than you would with a gateway first build.    The zerg invests a lot by hatchery blocking. Some lost mining time for you is not a big deal. It can be compared to a cannon rush against zerg. Zergs need to send a lot of drones to stop it, and are ahead if they manage to kill the cannons before they go up, even though they lost some mining time while defending it.   Hatchery block is like a cannon rush for Zerg. It will delay their game a lot if you kill the hatchery before it finishes.  I saw a post somewhere about the exact math of how many probes that are needed to cancel a building hatchery in time, at different stages in the hatchery building process, but I can't find it right now. I usually find it early fortunately, and kill it with 4-5 probes and a zealot."
allthingsprotoss,349cws,1lur1,6,Wed Apr 29 11:20:47 2015 UTC,"if you are going nexus first, and they hatch block you, by the time you go forge the a cannon the hatch will finish, and you will probably just lose the game. You need to just pull the higher probe count and cancel the hatch with probes. The math was done on this by someone on TL, and if you cancel the hatch with pure probes (7-9) you will be behind economically, but not as much as if you can never take a natural. I don't even know how much I would recommend the cannon response. If im opening forge I would use the money to cannon rush them as I kill the hatch with pure probes, as generally hatch blocks are a version of 3 hatch before pool. :)"
allthingsprotoss,349cws,willdrum4food27,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:57:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice :)
allthingsprotoss,349cws,Emyndri,3,Wed Apr 29 20:03:45 2015 UTC,"Another option that wasn't mentioned was either 5gate allin or immortal sentry 4gate allin.   Both of these builds can be challenging for a zerg to hold without the hatch block. With the hatchblock (you want it to finish) they can usually kill lower level zergs, and even some good zergs!   If they cancel the hatch, you can just expand and then 3gate pressure"
allthingsprotoss,349cws,WonkaKnowsBest,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:08:16 2015 UTC,If only my sentry micro was good enough :P Ill definitely try it when I get a bit better
allthingsprotoss,349cws,fernando_69,2,Wed Apr 29 21:40:52 2015 UTC,"3 1/2 options here.  Either 1) accept it's happened and throw down a forge/gateway and kill it that way and play from pretty far behind.  2) go nexus first in another place while getting a forge and just trying to take a farther third and connect them quickly, risky but can absolutely work.  3) do what pros do occasionally and pull 9 probes or so and surround it asap so they have to cancel and you're about even. he invested 300 minerals he couldn't use and you probably lost 150 in mining time.  3 1/2, don't let it happen if you see the drone, either from scouting or when you see it in base, pull 2 probes and play like zerg does when you're threatening to block them with a pylon.  Edit: Parting just did this ^ vs Dark on overgrowth in GSL not 5 minutes after and it worked."
allthingsprotoss,349cws,WonkaKnowsBest,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:57:28 2015 UTC,Thanks! Im thinking I'll just start sending the two probes down if I see his drone head for my nat instead of main

allthingsprotoss,3491o0,Dezib,2,Wed Apr 29 07:00:10 2015 UTC,"the only thing I think you have to look out for is gas first. Gas first mines hit fast enough to cause you issues with blink builds. Reaper into mines you first obs should be out in time, or at the very least out before the mine goes off the 2nd time, so that's holdable."
allthingsprotoss,3491o0,willdrum4food27,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:00:32 2015 UTC,"would I be behind, if it comes out after the mine goes off once? what if it kills 1 probe? what if it kills 5?"
allthingsprotoss,3491o0,willdrum4food27,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:46:39 2015 UTC,"I mean with reaper into mine it depends on the map when it hits of course but the obs comes out p much close to when it hits with that build. Of course if the obs pops are your main and the mine drop hits the nat yeah the mine will have a chance to go off pending on your stalker placement and what not, but its on you to pull probes or sack a probe still. Mines aren't fun when they can just sit there, and you cant clean them up right away. Which with gas first the mines hit that fast. Hell gas first proxy fact the mines hit before a robo build has an obs out. But yeah, obviously even with detection a good mine shot can happen, but you do have a higher stalker count then most builds and once you have blink the medivacs will be more killable, and you actually have the potential to counterattack if you held off mines very well."
allthingsprotoss,3491o0,Emyndri,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:11:15 2015 UTC,blink into robo is still the most common macro build in the current PvT meta.  Last night's WCS NA showcased both NA protoss players trying mostly blink builds with mixed success.

allthingsprotoss,347l5x,AGIANTSMURF,2,Tue Apr 28 23:52:34 2015 UTC,one good tip would be to place your pylon and gateway in such a way that the gateway covers the pylon and you leave a 1 zealot sized gap where you can protect it easily.   The goal is to be able to defend the pylon but move back into the gap so that he cant fight you 2 v 1 with his zealots while you wait for more units to spawn.
allthingsprotoss,347l5x,AGIANTSMURF,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:10:35 2015 UTC,This is an awesome idea thanks! i never considered building placement too much in PvP

allthingsprotoss,347l5x,AGIANTSMURF,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:13:02 2015 UTC,"having trouble picturing this, can you give an example screenshot of what you mean? In PvP I generally put my pylon behind the mineral line and completely block it in with gate (and cyber if needed)."
allthingsprotoss,347l5x,KOUJIROFRAU,2,Wed Apr 29 23:13:36 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/avvvGOu.jpg  all the red circles are spaces where only 1 zealot can fit. The arrow is the only real place he'd be able to try and attack you. but then he has to basically enter your mineral line and risk getting surrounded by probes before he has enough zealots to adequetly fight them. by that point you should have a mothership core out or more units or w.e you're using to defend.   The second pylon placement is a bit more optional, a smart idea might be to use it to reinforce the gateway incase the first one falls, but its a bit harder to tuck it somewhere it wont be focused down."
allthingsprotoss,347l5x,notjustjon,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:04:47 2015 UTC,thanks!
allthingsprotoss,347l5x,eathbau,2,Thu Apr 30 01:22:00 2015 UTC,"really happy to see you gg! that is the first step to winning in sc2.    but, what you wanna do vs 2 gate zealot is as soon as you scout it, cancel worker production, any gas you are making, and make a 2nd gate.    next, you wanna make sure you aren't gonna get supply blocked, but if you have any spare minerals it's a good idea to add on workers at this point, because you are assuming you will not only lose some workers while defending, but you need to lose some workers while defending because you will need to pull workers to fight with your zealots to usually defend this type of proxy 2 gate.  getting a surround on his zealots with your probes and zealots is ideal.  if oyu scout his proxy 2 gate too late, you want to typically go for 1 gateway, make a msc asap (stay on 1 gas) and make zealots in the meantime to saving up gas for stalkers.  again, you want to make workers with your excess minerals, this time though it's because the msc will take sometime to kill his zealots, so you will lose some workers in the process.    (i would 100% recommend not 9 pylon scouting!, it's the less efficient way to play, instead scout after gateway, but thoroughly scout around your main, nat and even sometimes near your 3rd base for proxy gates),"
allthingsprotoss,347l5x,M0ka,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:22:48 2015 UTC,Thanks a ton! yeah i'm using the Sos 3 gate blink hallucination scout so i don't really see what they are doing until like 6:00 anyway. I just check proxy spots after gateway
allthingsprotoss,347l5x,Infestor,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:13:32 2015 UTC,"When I scout proxy 2 gates, I usually go for 13 gate, 15 gate, 17 gate and outmass them in Zealots + destroy their proxies/tech at appropriate times."
