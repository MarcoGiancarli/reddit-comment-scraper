MakeupRehab,3e0n60,MouldyMug,6,Tue Jul 21 20:18:57 2015 UTC,"Probably my poor, long-suffering Stila Liquid Eyeliner.   I bought this over a year ago, used it for wings maybe 20 times, then got really frustrated with it. As it turns out, I'm not a wings kind of girl. The formula was O.K., but seemed patchy for the price, and the liner just didn't have too many other uses.   I regretted it, but it continued to mock me from it's cup on the counter. I went back to my gel eyeliner ways.  About two months ago, I was getting annoyed with the lack of staying power my gel liner had. It's hot and humid here in the southeast United States, and makeup can slide off of your face in no time. After a week or so of terrifying hobo-eyes, I finally tried the Stila liner again in desperation one afternoon.   Magic! It went on like it was new, made a nice, thin tight-line over the existing gel liner, and IT WAS STILL THERE FOUR HOURS LATER!!   Using it sparingly over the gel liner, just at my lash-line, was the saving grace. It never occurred to me to try it with other products when I first bought it. The gel under it really softens the harshness of the liquid line, and the liquid seems to keep the gel in place longer than it stays on its own."

When I first bought it, it was the wrong shade and the brush applicator didn't blend out the product enough (yeah, I was a super newbie to makeup). Stuffed it away in a drawer and forgot about. Then, a couple months later I came across it and was like ""wait.. Is this for my undereyes??"" Yes. Yes it is. And it's a great undereye concealer. Who knew?"

Two-ish years ago, everyone on mua was going on about orange lips and I jumped right in on that bandwagon. Didn't want to go full-on opaque though, so I thought that a lp butter would be a safe choice. The dang thing came off pretty bright though. I put off wearing it for the longest time until summer of last year where I wanted to to try it again on a lark. This time I blotted it with some tissue paper and it looked SO nice. Been using it as my summer color since then. I'm really sad that they've discontinued the shade and I wasn't able to get backups before I realized it. :("

Everybody raved about this foundation, so I bought it and even bought the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush to use with it. I pump it out, dot it onto my face, and blend. It was just awful... cakey, orange, streaky and caught on every dry flake. I set it aside ready to destash, and forgot about it for a while. A while later, a friend of mine did her own destash and gave me a 90% empty bottle in a different shade. I didn't have much hope for the formula but wanted to see if the shade matches, if only so I can use it to match other foundations in the future. Lo and behold, it was fantastic! The shade was perfect, the finish looked natural, and it was effortless to put on. It is now one of my favourite foundations and I've already repurchased!  To sum up how I made it work: shade 3.0 (original purchase) oxidized badly, causing the orangeness, and I applied waaay too much (one full pump) directly on the face which is why it looked cakey and wouldn't blend out properly. I now use shade 5.0 (summer shade, winter is 4.0; neither oxidize) and do a half-pump on the back of my hand, then dip the brush in my hand before applying on face."

Yesterday I was on the verge of destashing it, but then tried it just as a normal liner, and that was much better than I thought it would be. Will keep it now. Coincidentally, it works great with a light golden liner I wasn't sure about, so it's really two products redeemed."

I also upgraded from cream to liquid eyeliner (thanks KVD) and almost threw the brown one out.   However I couldn't find a good brow product that didn't come out slightly reddish looking. So I tried the eyeliner and bam! It works well enough. I figure I'll upgrade to an actual brow product when I use this one up."

I don't know if I would like it with a more cool toned bronzer but it's actually pretty with the one it comes with.

MakeupRehab,3dsyxj,dellaluce,8,Sun Jul 19 04:34:45 2015 UTC,What about pair your writing skills with your passion for makeup and post to MakeupAlley? That will give you a distraction from buying and will probably help other people.

MakeupRehab,3dr222,minnilivi,5,Sat Jul 18 17:07:30 2015 UTC,"What are your reasons for not reaching for your other palettes? Will those same reasons apply to this palette? I definitely think you should try out the other palettes in your collection for awhile to see if they meet your needs. The BECCA Ombre Rouge palette is permanent, so you can take the time you need to try out what you already have."
MakeupRehab,3dr222,bettertheangel,2,Sat Jul 18 17:18:05 2015 UTC,"Good point about it being permanent. I should take the time to rotate through what I have and make decisions on them so I can figure out why I don't reach for them more. I do live in an area where not many of my peers wear makeup, and if they do it's very understated--pretty much always the no makeup-makeup look. Sometimes I feel a bit reigned in by that. I've often had well meaning people in my life ask what I'm so dressed up for and ask what the occasion is when I put on makeup. Who knows, maybe by the time the fall sale rolls around I'll have ""room"" for the palette. Or maybe I will have forgotten about it by then! I do tend to get overly excited about stuff that's new and jump to purchasing because it's pretty, and forgetting to consider if I really want/need it in my stash."
MakeupRehab,3dr222,bettertheangel,6,Sat Jul 18 17:24:44 2015 UTC,"I wear bright red lipstick to work every day, and eventually people just stopped asking questions. In all of my pictures with other people on Facebook, I am the only person wearing a full face of makeup. If you are worried about the reaction you are getting when you wear anything that is out of the norm, then I think it might be beneficial and embrace that you are different. You have pretty, colorful makeup and it's a shame that it doesn't get enough love.   Of course, if you don't want to embrace color and want to stick to neutrals, then destash those items. However, you bough those items for a reason. Let them bring you happieness when you use them.   (Tell me to shut up if my opinion is out of line.)  Waiting until the fall sale is a good idea. Add the BECCA palette to a wish list and come back to it when you can save some money on it. That will give you time to start loving what you have. Plus, it will mean more to you if you plan the purchase rather than buying it on a whim."
MakeupRehab,3dr222,wake--up,4,Sat Jul 18 17:36:04 2015 UTC,Have you ever handled the other becca palette? I had it for a while and the packaging just feels too cheap to me. It's very lightweight plastic and I wouldn't trust it anywhere other than my vanity.
MakeupRehab,3dr222,kelsial,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:41:09 2015 UTC,I haven't! Thanks for telling me that. I was rather disappointed when I got the hourglass blush palette and felt how cheap it feels so I probably would be annoyed by this!

This could help with your destashing, or even finding you can create the look you're going for without needing to buy anything new."
MakeupRehab,3dr222,LemonX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:47:34 2015 UTC,"Have you thought about or done a depotting before? In case you already have colors similar to the ombré nudes palette, maybe put these palettes out in the place where you do your make up and use them. If you like it, and you want the shadows in one palette, you could depot them and put them in a z palette! I don't know how big your collection is or if you would even consider depotting as an option (if you love the packaging), but maybe you have dupes for the eyeshadows scatteres across your palettes already!"
