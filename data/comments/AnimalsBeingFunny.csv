AnimalsBeingFunny,35vnju,Elusional,7,Wed May 13 22:04:01 2015 UTC,"Wait.. you don't want them barking/howling when company is over and you shock them when they do but then you go and encourage them to bark and howl and rewarded them with giggles and attention when they did?? How are those mixed messages fair to them?  Do you even understand how you're setting them up for emotional and physical issues (shock collar)?  It appears you two really need to learn how to raise dogs. Find a dog behaviorist and work closely with them. Learn what howling is about (they do it to bond with you as their pack leaders, display their location when separated from you, and ward off others from their territory for starters) and learn how to administer reward and punishment consistently.   If you want them to stop howling, fine. Just don't encourage them to do so other times and then fuck them up by hurting them physically when they do other times."
AnimalsBeingFunny,35vnju,EmbroideredLexicon,1 point,Fri May 15 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"While I understand your point of view, I can assure you that the dogs do not experience the actual shock of the collar. We do not use the collar on the animals.  I can assure you just the humiliating effect of having the collar on is enough to correct the behavior. That is what they are afraid of.  I did not make a point to ""shock"" the animals into being traumatized. You are over analyzing the situation.  With that being said, I do understand what you are saying.  I have had interactions with many breeds of different canines.   I am aware of canine behavior do/do nots.  As far as your allegations of us physically harming them I am appalled.  I never hurt any animal, emotionally or physically."
