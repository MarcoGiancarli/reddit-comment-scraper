Thetruthishere,3e2vio,Etonet,5,Tue Jul 21 19:43:18 2015 UTC,"I mean there's always a chance of that. But there was seriously no place to hide anyone in that apartment. Unless she was Spiderman or something. And I don't think he would make someone jump out of a second story window. I don't think he even knew when I would be there exactly. The building did give you the creeps though, mainly at night. It was just so old."
Thetruthishere,3e2vio,twobitdandy,3,Tue Jul 21 19:48:50 2015 UTC,"spooky subreddit mixup aside, when you described how the girl looked at you with an expressionless face -- it gave me the creeps... I could almost picture it myself.  From what I've heard, when people see full-on apparitions like that (where they are fully manifested and in effect seem to appear as 3 dimensional people but with a certain 'yeah no something is def wrong about them' feeling), it can really shake a person up.   I almost thought she might be a residual spirit, just going about her usual loop through walls and doors, but she looked at you."
Thetruthishere,3e2vio,AshamedPakiHenna,4,Wed Jul 22 00:39:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah it really weirded me out. And now sometimes I'm afraid that I'm gunna see someone and they aren't going to be a real person. The only thing that was off about her was her super pale skin and that look she gave me. And it's like, in all of the ghost stories you hear about, it's dark at night and you hear all these noises and you know something is there. But this was broad daylight, had no idea she was some kind of apparition, I had literally JUST talked to the apartment manager minutes before. It was one of those instances where I had to ask myself afterwards ""Am I crazy? Did I hallucinate or something?"""
Thetruthishere,3e2vio,Fermats_Last_Account,2,Wed Jul 22 00:49:10 2015 UTC,Was she actually expressionless or was it more of that tired/pissed/eyes half open kinda look?  Did she open the door she exited out of?

Thetruthishere,3dzivg,NChick,5,Mon Jul 20 20:14:29 2015 UTC,"I totally believe that they stay with us.  We saw our old dogs (two of them, 10 years apart) who had lived their entire lives with us, after they had passed.  One had died at the vet's office and the other one had died in the house in her sleep during the night.  It wasn't just me that saw them, my mother saw them as well.  The second dog, who died when I was about 23, used to run along with us when we went from the living room into the kitchen, and on numerous occasions my mom would do this stutter-step thing and then stand there with an incredulous look on her face and say ""I just tripped over Buffy"" because the dog would get tangled up in her legs and my mom didn't want to trip over her.  You're not crazy, it wasn't a trick of the light.  It was your dog.  Be comforted by her visits.  She'll be around for a while, and then once she is convinced that you are OK, she will go on.  Don't be surprised, though, if somewhere along the way, you are drawn to adopt a dog just because it reminds you so much of your dog, because I do believe that they come back and they do find a way to find us and live with us again.  I had one cat with me for three different lifetimes.  It does happen.  I am convinced."
Thetruthishere,3dzivg,Ghyllie,2,Tue Jul 21 06:45:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, I wish she still visited me. She came to me again not too long after the above incident, but nothing since. She died in 2009 and I'm not in mourning but I think you never stop grieving a loss.  I could understand her having left some sort of imprint on that house, but I'm miles away now - do you think they can visit a building they've never even seen? I wonder how I'd go about asking her."
Thetruthishere,3dzivg,Ghyllie,2,Tue Jul 21 23:32:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know whether or not they can visit a building they have never been to.  All of our sightings took place in the house where they lived with us and had stopped for a good many years before we moved from there, so I have no point of reference on that one.  I hesitate to recommend an animal psychic because it's difficult enough to find a HUMAN psychic or medium who is on the up and up and not out to take people for a ride, I can't imagine how difficult it would be to try to find someone who can communicate with ANIMALS who have passed.  :("
Thetruthishere,3dzivg,butteryoatmeal,3,Wed Jul 22 00:03:40 2015 UTC,"It was no mind trick.  She was just doing what she always did.  She didn't leave just because her body did.  She probably still makes appearances now and then though you may not even be around to witness it.  Animals are every bit as aware and emotionally rich as humans are.  I will give you a couple of examples.  When my youngest was in elementary school, she got a couple of dwarf hamsters.  They were in separate cages, but then suddenly they wanted to be together and got along well.  And then not.  The female had a litter.  Then they had another litter a couple of months later.  We had a house full of hamsters.  Sometimes they got out and would go on excursions around the house.  They had fun lives as caged animals go.  They were friendly, happy, and full of personality.  They don't have particularly long lives though.  I used to mind my boss's and friends' dogs for them while they were away on holiday.  Two dogs in particular, who stayed with us periodically during and after the hamster years, would watch as ""something"" wandered around the edges of the floorboards or around and into their food bowls.  They would watch and sniff.  They would do this regularly, but not at their own homes.  Only here.  At the same time we had and have always had dwarf rabbits, the eldest of whom died recently.  She was thirteen years old.  She was extraordinary in that she was a true lady.  We never had to clip her nails or groom her otherwise.  She was always clean and neat.  When she got to be about ten, we would find her in death poses.  It was like she was rehearsing for her deathbed.  Scared the bejeezuz out of us at first.  She would change poses periodically.  But when it came to her real final days, it wasn't so pretty and certainly not what any of us would have expected.  She wasn't able to move anymore.  We had to prop her up so that she could eat and drink.  She was completely incontinent so we had to bathe her a couple of times a day.  My clairvoyant daughter (who lives in another country entirely) had a dream after a few weeks of this that this rabbit spoke to her, saying ""I died.  I finally died!"", but her body was still eating, drinking, and breathing.  She just wasn't there anymore.  About a week after that she finally passed.  I woke up at that moment and went to check on her first thing, not because of a dream but because I just felt something.  She was still warm but had finally let go of her tight grip on life.  Our existence is much richer than our current belief system would have us think.  Your own observations will show you that if you stop doubting and start knowing.  The truth is right in front of you."
Thetruthishere,3dzivg,butteryoatmeal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:15:51 2015 UTC,"If she was still doing it, it would be a real shame, because my parents (still in the same house) have never been able to... 'pick up' (?) the things I can (whether or not these things are paranormal in nature or tricks of the brain). They definitely believe, but they've never seen/smelt/heard things themselves. I witnessed a smaller and perhaps somehow spookier incident a little later, but nothing since. (I've also had experiences with another lost loved-one.)  It used to be fairly frequent, then a few years ago it stopped. It was a bit scary when it happened but I was always curious to try and figure it out, and would always call out and try to get a response of some kind.  Oh, I definitely believe. I'm just what you might call a skeptic believer... I think most things can be explained by tricks of the light/brain, other phenomena, or combinations thereof - and yet, I just can't believe that a being can exist, with thoughts, and feelings, and experiences, and worries, and doubts, and joy, and all the rest, and just. suddenly. stop. I just can't make that make sense to me, if you see what I mean."
Thetruthishere,3dzivg,OldSpaceChaos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:28:44 2015 UTC,"She was hanging around for her own reasons, probably trying to continue to fulfill her emotional duties within the family.  When both she and your parents were no longer in need of that, or if they got another dog, for example, she would likely have stopped at that point.    You probably did get a response when you attempted communication with her.  It may not have been readily noticeable though.  This is true for reasons I really don't understand, but I'm not a person who needs those explanations anymore.  It's far more beneficial, in my experience, to simply observe things without trying to figure them out.   Our logic/rationale in the physical world are not commutable to the other realms.  The physical is a particular set of conditions.  Trying to understand they whys and wherefores of the rest (and there's a lot more to existence out there than there is here) just won't ever work.  Feelings are our best tool when trying to understand things ""out there""."

I hadn't visited him in the hospital and had been feeling incredibly guilty about it, then had a dream one night where we were at a company picnic and he was in a wheelchair, I gave him a hug and we were both crying and we both knew it was goodbye. I woke up crying from it. IRL he declined quickly and passed away a couple weeks later. I still feel guilty about never seeing him in the hospital, but I take some comfort that maybe we did have our goodbye after all."
Thetruthishere,3dyjz3,wafflesalmighty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:02:46 2015 UTC,"The same happened to me, a year ago the 7th of this month. My grandmother had been battling heart problems and it came to the point where she'd gotten an infection in her heart. I visited her twice, the second time was when they told us about the infection after that I stopped visiting because she'd gotten to the point where she referred to all relatives as long dead family members. I was unable to handle seeing one of the women that raised me go through this. Not sure how long after that I was asleep trying to catch a bit before my work shift, and in the dream my grandmother was telling me goodbye. Now that I think about it this is the second time this has happened my great grandmother had this thing about lightly tickling me in a spot on my side, well the night of her passing I was in a haze of grief and sleep and was dreaming of her when I felt that spot be tickled and I felt something wash over me like a warm feeling or feeling of relief that she wasn't suffering."

I have no explanation for the beings running through your house, the creatures in the backyard... dude, sorry you're going through this. Perhaps grab a St. Benedict's medal for protection at a minimum, and consider reaching out to Amy & Steve from the Dead Files. If you're at your wit's end, ask them for help. Maybe they can get to the bottom of whatever is happening: http://www.helpmedeadfiles.com/  Worst case, they say no and you're back to square one. They might even be able to suggest next steps if they can't come out personally.  The attack on your pets may be a coyote. Totally a shot in the dark on this one, since I don't know where you live, but coyotes were a growing concern in my hometown before I moved this year. They go after pets, and their dens are often littered with remains of lost pets. I'm glad yours survived, but I think keeping an eye on them is best. Look into coyote and other predator activity in your town.  Good luck."

They just looked like little balls of fire or roundish candle flames moving across the sky. Definitely not any sort of airplane or satellite as they made no sound, and it wasn't an electronic light that they gave off. From what I remember, I'm pretty sure they always appeared somewhere  along the same path in the sky, moving either South or North. Sometimes they would start fading away and disappear completely. Some nights you would see multiple in succession, other nights you would only see one.   Edit: I also don't think it could be explained as ball lightning, as the nights I saw them were always sparsely clouded or completely clear."

As for more doll stories in particular, I have another one you might be interested in. My step grandmother collected dolls. Her entire house was filled with every type of doll you can think of from Barbies to the life sized dolls to the cheap plastic dolls to the really expensive, limited edition series. They were everywhere, always staring at you. I always used to hate spending the night at her house. Not just because of the fact that the dolls were everywhere, but also because I could swear that I'd hear them murmuring to each other in the dark.  A few times I was pretty sure I saw them walking around in the middle of the night too. I knew I wasn't dreaming because my sister saw the same thing. I don't care if the dolls were friendly or what. I just never enjoyed being in that house."

Thetruthishere,3dtflp,Bizrat7,4,Sun Jul 19 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"It's face often changed from happy, to sad, to angry, to basically whatever emotion is was trying to convey. I was not the only one who heard the doll. My mom often heard it making noises, but assumed it was the neighbor's baby (since we had a neighbor with many children across the street).   She became more suspicious after I would tell her the doll would end up in my bed and she knew that no one had moved the doll during the night (my sister was a baby at the time, she couldn't have done it, and my step dad was usually out of town).   The house the doll in the first story was in, was actually haunted. That is a whole other story I am not sure I can share here. I never knew if the doll was acting that way because it was just a haunted doll, or if it was being effected by the energy of the house in general. But any way you look at it, it was freaky.

Thetruthishere,3dohrx,HOKESmusic,6,Fri Jul 17 23:12:19 2015 UTC,"Very cool. Have had similar experiences with my father's father from smelling his famous cherry vanilla cigars when no one else here smokes them. no one wears cherry vanilla perfume either seeing as cherry smell usually makes me sick. I wear vanilla body spray sometimes but if you've ever smelled a cherry vanilla cigar smoke you know its very distinctively difference from perfume. Also he whistles like my father and I both but I can only do basic whistles only my grandfather could whistle like birds and whistle full songs. So I've been alone at home reading a book or playing a game (i never play with game sounds because it gets repetitive and annoying.) and hear a song being whistled. My sister when she was younger would stand up in her crib and say ""pop pop"" having never met my grand father but she would be reaching up as if wanting to be picked up. And when she was older she described him in his police officer uniform when the only picture we have of him in his uniform we didn't get until years later from our grandmother."

Some rehash for those who missed mine:   I was grabbed on the right shoulder, while fully awake but under the covers face down in my bed. In the dark. I had tugged the overhead light cord only seconds earlier. An unseen presence prompted me to speak as if speaking to my own father, though upon looking at my supposed conversational companion, I realized I could hear my father having a conversation elsewhere. During an overnight camping trip, a scary head rose out of a green campfire and made faces at myself and several others.  While on a date in a collection of artist's studios after hours, heard a demonic, canine growling and slobbering with no known source, though we scoured the place for any human, animal, or machinery or technical device that could have caused the sound.   Aside from the first encounter, which was tremendously frightening, I haven't found these experiences anything more than perplexing and entertaining. I'd repeat any of them in a second, even my initial grabbing incident."

Thetruthishere,3dlwpx,janetstOad,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"You know before I saw your video (after the boys had their little tiff over shadow people! Lol!), my first thought was how people want their videos on YouTube to go viral. Did you happen to hear or see the one of the guy that was dressed in a Gilly suit to look like Bigfoot (not sure if I spelled Gillies suit correctly, I even used my voice to record it in hopes my phone would spell better & understand what I meant better than I could! Lol) ? It's the camouflage suit either used in the military or for hunting. He was attempting to catch himself on video with witnesses, I ass-u-me, so his Bigfoot video would go viral, as I stated above. He misjudged the distance of an oncoming car that was innocently driving down the road when not only that car struck him, but another car behind the first hit him also. He was killed.  All for a video. It was also shot in the evening for obvious reasons.  People like that are making it hard for the paranormal community, the legitimate claims, a mockery.  I feel bad for the mans in the suit, but his judgment was not only bad, stupid & selfish, but what about the poor people in the cars? What about his family & friends? Not the way I'd want to be known to go out!  The drivers of these cars have to live with killing a person & the trauma for the rest of their lives.  Not to mention the people that at the very least, have either caught an actual Bigfoot or other paranormal phenomena and how now or in the futures credibility is shot to hell! It will forever put MORE doubt in the minds of people that are sceptics or if they weren't skeptical in the first place, they will be now.  My point is (finally! I apologize. I'm a woman & Italian & not only does it take me awhile to get to my point, it's hard to type & talk with my hands! Lol!), what you may have seen, could have been just what I was saying above. I couldn't tell by your video if that was even a possibility. Not trying to insult you at all or doubt you, it is just hard to tell his perhaps someone was in one of those skin suit thingies with contact lenses in their holes in their face!  I don't doubt you saw something & do believe in the paranormal, just check my DVR! It's just hard to tell in a situation like yours. Now, WHEN you catch that whatever that was in your house on video, well, that's a whole different story! Lol!  I only know what I've seen on television or heard people talk about shadow people on the Internet. But that's what my second guess would be of what you saw.  Sorry for the long post! Explanation above! Lol!  I really hope there isn't something following you or stalking you and it's one big coincidence for your sake as well as your brother who was kind enough to get you another batter! What I mean, again, is I hope you don't see 'them' in or around your home! Good luck op!"
Thetruthishere,3dlwpx,wingnutkj,3,Sat Jul 18 14:53:17 2015 UTC,"Hello Janetstoad. Since you talked so much I may as well address some of your points.   1.) I have heard of several stories of people getting hurt as they were dressed as big foot. These tales alone are like their own urban myth. I have not heard of the person being hit by two cars though.   2.) I did not see a person in a suit or costume. I've seen people walking on the country roads, this wasn't that. It also wouldn't have had the right proportions. On top of that this happened during a thunderstorm and I don't think someone would be in something like a morph suit while in a storm for shits and giggles.   3.) The point of the video was to show the road I came up on and the conditions for anyone curious and I thought it would lend the story more credibility. It wasn't to catch a shadow person/stick man on video, it wasn't going to happen. Unfortunately the video came out too dark to be useful which was disappointing. If I had a dash cam the night before I think I would have caught something for sure or at least I could review the footage. (If it got a brighter picture.)  4.) It wasn't in my home it was on a rural road that I drive on.   5.) I have not see the show Dead Files. However the notion that there are a lot more of these things is disturbing/intriguing. It is strange that there is a new phenomenon of stick men/shadow people after all this time."
Thetruthishere,3dlwpx,ElbowRage,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:24:22 2015 UTC,"Please don't think I was doubting your story! On the contrary, which is why I mentioned The Dead Files. There's more out there than any of us have heard of, I believe & I also stated the the psychic on the shows credibility, I think! I meant to if I didn't! Lol!  So that's what their called! A morph suit! My son HAD to have one when they were the latest greatest! Lol!  Part of me wants you to find answers as to what you saw, but part of me does not! I wouldn't want you to be put in danger not knowing what these things are capable of!  Your drawings & descriptions don't sound too much like the 'normal' if you will, stories of shadow people, though!"
Thetruthishere,3dlwpx,janetstOad,2,Sun Jul 19 05:20:40 2015 UTC,Here is a link to a recorded encounter 40 minutes from where I had my encounter. It also has a drawing with the jagged knees and elbows!!  http://kenny.anomalyresponse.org/indianafigure04.html
Thetruthishere,3dlwpx,Radium_Coyote,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:33:53 2015 UTC,That's scary as hell! Thanks for sharing that! Do YOU think it's a shadow person after I ass-u-me you possibly read about them to see if maybe that's what you saw?
Thetruthishere,3dlwpx,Thisdarlingdeer,2,Tue Jul 21 07:31:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know what I saw. I didn't really read up on the shadow people/ stick men extensively. However I doubt it was a shadow people for sure. No hat, no trench coat, and this was outside. It could have been a stick man, but people seem to have so many different types of stickmen I am somewhat skeptical of that, plus nobody mentioned the feature of the knees and elbows that stick out to a point.   I am reluctant to call it an alien, but I don't know about that.   Currently in my mind I call it a monster and what scares the shit out of me is that it was very real. I'm at that intersection every night and now it terrifies me. I need to contact the people at the website who created the report for 2004 and also go out in the daylight and get pictures and measurements."
Thetruthishere,3dlwpx,Radium_Coyote,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:55:40 2015 UTC,"I can tell how negatively this experience has affected you. I'm really sorry. I would probably react the same way. Probably worse. I'd be freaked out enough to check into a hotel with no sleeves & nice people that feed me pretty little pills to keep me drooling on myself! Lol! Don't forget the diaper I'd be needing!  What I've heard of shadow people that I've seen on the shows I watch very extensively (which by far does NOT make me the parapsychologist I actually wanted to be when I graduated high school in '84. Plans got derailed:( ) are that not all shadow people have top hats & look like that. In facet on one show, this man saw in the house he was living in at the time, some of the shadow people he saw looked like they were from the Victorian Era! He could actually seen the high collar on the long dress on a woman & her husband & child.  Come to find out these multitudes of people he saw going from one place to another consistently, were there for a long time because he met up with someone else he found that lived in the house and they saw them too. Like there was a portal in there.  Maybe that's what you found in that area. A type of portal where these things come & go. The question is, has anyone else had an experience in the same place as you? I'd check out some of the local legends in that area & in your town. It's possible others like you might have had and seen the same thing & someone else might know the answers to your questions.  I know, I know! It's a good idea huh? Just kidding. I just wanted to lighten up your mood for once since this has happened to you, I ASSume. I don't blame you. Please keep us posted if you happen to see them again or find anything out on what they are or learn anything at all.  Best wishes & please stay safe. Janet"

Thetruthishere,3dlwpx,Radium_Coyote,4,Sat Jul 18 01:10:03 2015 UTC,"Sure. At this point I guess I'll just chalk it up to Pareidolia and it being late. Two possible explanations are shadow people and stick men.   http://listverse.com/2009/04/24/top-10-bizarre-modern-paranormal-phenomena/ http://martinjclemens.com/black-stick-men-the-next-paranormal-fad/  Apparently the stick men are more likely to be alongside a road. However, I can't find pictures or drawings of what people have seen. The shadow people don't look like what I saw based off google image results. People have descriptions, but I guess nobody has drawn what they saw.   Since I will be there again tonight I am taking a camera with me and will take a picture of the places I saw them. Currently I suspect that the bushes where I saw the first one will just make weird shapes that would look like what I saw. Also that there will see a red reflector where I saw the thing with red eyes.   I will also take some bonus shots while I am out with the camera.   Fortunately/unfortunately my phone that I was going to use to take pictures with died today. It decided to overheat while charging and doesn't work. Yay. My brother is letting me use his camera and I am getting extra batteries to make sure it doesn't die. Hopefully it doesn't implode.   I got what I was looking for today though, learned about shadow people and stick people."

As much as I often say, ""perhaps you took that out of context""... there's not much possibility of that.  You are perhaps in some amount of danger.  These entities are colloquially known as ""shadow people"".  Usually, they're just going about business that does not involve you.

Shades, or shadow people, are pretty much incomplete or partially made souls. Think of them as the mentally challenged relatives of sentient beings. Some are helpful, some are neutral, some are pranksters, and some are just plain bad. I'd agree with the above statement, don't ask what, ask why.   If you can find a spiritual group (wiccans, pagans, christians, etc.) They should be able to help you figure that out."
Thetruthishere,3dlwpx,livensaurum,11,Fri Jul 17 20:55:00 2015 UTC,"This is such bullshit. Neither you nor anyone else has any idea what ""shadow people"" are. You have no idea what the underlying phenomena behind shadow people are and the fact that you act like you do helps to discredit the whole paranormal community. You are part of the reason paranormal events are still looked at like ghost stories and not investigated by mainstream science.  One person who sees shadow people could have a mental illness, another could be witnessing a natural phenomena or illusion, and another could be witnessing a paranormal entity yet to be explained or understood. I grant you that yes, some of those paranormal entities could be of a type with some sort of metaphysical/spiritual origin."

Thetruthishere,3dmqzs,BlitzChick,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:51:39 2015 UTC,"Chinese lanterns are basically a miniature hot air balloon-- a paper disk with a crepe paper 'envelope.' You put a candle inside, and the heat carries it away. I've seen a few colors, but most are red or white. They do flicker slightly, but they don't make fast movements or sharp turns."
Thetruthishere,3dmqzs,BlitzChick,2,Sat Jul 18 03:13:35 2015 UTC,"There's another thing similar to a Chinese lantern that someone taught me when I was in my teens. It's sort of a ""UFO prank."" You use a piece of newspaper (I think it uses a couple of layers, if I remember correctly), fold the corners together (this works best with a piece that's close to square-shaped), and pierce the corners with a toothpick to fasten them together. Turn it over and set it on fire. If it's done properly it will float up into the sky. It works like a hot air balloon, except that the ""balloon"" itself is actually on fire and will eventually burn up. The person who taught me that said it makes people report UFOs.  Please note that this is not a good thing to do and I do not recommend actually doing it. I'm just suggesting it as a possibility for identification. The wind would have to catch it to make it move like the object described in the original post."

Thetruthishere,3dk4rb,alecz127,3,Fri Jul 17 01:01:07 2015 UTC,Yes. So it was dark out but you could still see it. It was darker than the night so it stood out yet you could still kind of see through it. When it moved unnaturally I mean that it was almost glitchy and skipped across its path and also left a trail like a gas or fog that you could see but instantly went away. So it trailed too. when it turned around it did so instantly as well and cut immediately back the other way up the bridge. so the size was about the size of a soft ball maybe a little bigger. It moved very quickly like fast walking pace. went in front of us and back down in what felt like 5-7 seconds. It went across in front of us going left up the bridge and then right back down.
Thetruthishere,3disos,RonWisely,6,Thu Jul 16 16:43:02 2015 UTC,"The biggest question I have is can you be absolutely certain that neither you nor your mother touched (or even accidentally bumped) the light or any part of it's assembly while you were there the first time?  It's obviously very rusty and degraded. Any movement could have caused it to fall eventually, some time after you left.   If you're sure no one touched it at all, I would not advise returning to that place. You wouldn't want to go back out there and have something follow you home. You know, unless you're not concerned about that kind of thing and you really want to go back and try to figure out why it fell."
Thetruthishere,3disos,PM_ME_YOUR_FOIBLES,4,Thu Jul 16 17:23:58 2015 UTC,"I'm positive I never touched the fixture and I'm pretty sure my mom didn't enter that room when she went in.   I wish you hadn't said anything about something following me home because you reminded me of something that happened that same night/morning after we got home. I was showing my mom the pictures and telling her what happened and then I went to the bathroom. The guest bathroom in the house I'm renting has a light switch that operates the light bulbs above the sink. There is a ceiling light that the switch doesn't turn on. I haven't found a switch that does. I just assumed it didn't have wires running to it anymore. I was using the bathroom with the sink lights on when all of a sudden the ceiling light turns on by itself. I didn't even know it had working bulbs in the fixture. I turned the light switch off and the sink lights and the ceiling light went off. I turned the switch on again and only the sink lights came on, like normal. The ceiling light has not come on again since that night. But there have been no other spooky events in the house and its been a few months."
Thetruthishere,3disos,PM_ME_YOUR_FOIBLES,6,Thu Jul 16 17:48:30 2015 UTC,"That is a little weird, considering it's a light that is the object of interest here, but you're probably fine. If it were me though, I'd have the landlord take a look at the light. Just in case there's some problem with the electrical. I think sometimes unexplainable things happen not because something evil makes it so, but as a message of some kind that can help. Maybe the message is ""Get The Light Fixed"". Good luck!"

Thetruthishere,3dgxci,Whippety,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:53:21 2015 UTC,"To make your own, what you can do (and what I've done) is get 4 pieces of printer paper, and tape them together to make one large piece of paper. I had a glass coffee table with the perfect sized removable glass top to put over the board for a smooth surface. If you don't have that glass part, I would suggest maybe just a larger piece of paper to act as the board maybe a poster paper. With black ink, probably a felt so you can see more clearly, write the alphabet across the paper (as seen on a ouija board) and ""yes"", ""no"", ""hello"", ""goodbye"" as well as numbers 0-9. Use a cup (glass cup) as a pointer and viola. I heard somewhere not to use red ink so I used black ink. My friends and I made a ouija board when we were 13 like this... very creepy things happened. I kid you not, we contacted this thing whatever it was called ""nicholas axe"".. asked him who each of us was going to marry and it gave an answer of boys from our school to each of our friends and then when I asked about who I was going to marry it said ""me."" And I said ""don't you see a problem with that"" and it said ""ghost."" I got creeped out and we ended the session, put the homemade board under my friend's dresser, put the cup away in the kitchen cupboard and went outside to play on the trampoline. One of us had to go to the bathroom but no one would go in alone. Trying to be the brave one, I said I would go first and led the way all holding hands. To get to the bathroom, we had to walk down the hallway past her bedroom where we used the board. As we walked by her room, I just glanced in and I kid you not, the ouija board was in the middle of the room (where we had been using it earlier) and the cup we had put away was on ""hello."" We all screamed and it was a struggle to push through each other to try and get out of the hallway first and escape her place. Her parents had both been at work that day, and us girls were the only ones home. We had put the board away and stayed together the whole time so no one could have done that. Some strange things happened at my home after as well as at hers. I don't know if anything followed my other friend who was there. Unfortunately I didn.t learn my lesson and used it a few more times because I'm curious but that first encounter using a ouija board was terrifying!! I don't know what's out there, but there is something out there. It all makes no ""logical"" sense but something is going on, clearly"

Thetruthishere,3dgxci,SCOOTERDOLL,13,Thu Jul 16 22:44:20 2015 UTC,"Do not ever use ouija boards, fuck these incidents are too common. If you want to get rid of it, you can, you are alive, which gives you a tremendous amount of power over it, understand this. It's not like the movies at all, don't antagonize it, don't ignore it. You should loudly verbally tell it to leave, this is your house. Throwing salt around and burning white sage will cleanse your house. Do not feed it, typically fear, anger, ect can increase activity. Use the opposite to your advantage, use feelings of happiness, protection, love, and be firm, stand your ground and evict this thing."
Thetruthishere,3dgxci,alecz127,5,Thu Jul 16 08:16:50 2015 UTC,I thought acknowledging the spirit gave them power though?

Thetruthishere,3dgxci,of8dreams,6,Thu Jul 16 18:33:18 2015 UTC,Not acknowledging but asking for a proof of their existence or asking them to show themselves. Never ever do either.
Thetruthishere,3dgxci,alecz127,4,Thu Jul 16 14:14:19 2015 UTC,"No, that's bullshit probably propagated by people who are afraid and have no idea what to do, or don't believe its possible so they figure the best possible course of action is to ignore it and it will go away. People also think it's totally cool to mess with ouija boards, or people that think ouija boards are pagan/good magic so it's totally cool to try to play ""contact spirits"" and see how that ended."
Thetruthishere,3dgxci,poop_giggle,5,Thu Jul 16 11:10:57 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I didn't think it was true considering that to cast out the spirit you had to acknowledge it in some manner.
Thetruthishere,3dgxci,of8dreams,3,Thu Jul 16 11:27:53 2015 UTC,"for the record, telling someone who's already used it not to use one is .. eh    beyond that, the key is to remove fear. it is a very powerful emotion. it is a food source for some entities. you must not be afraid. when you're not afraid, their food source goes away.. if there's nothing there for them to gain from, they go away.   you cannot be harmed. and know, we all come from the same Source. we are all part of One Thing. don't let fear separate yourself from All. that entity is also from the Source you are from, One Thing. remember that you have more in common with it than you think. since you are so similar, know there is nothing to be afraid of."
Thetruthishere,3dgxci,alecz127,2,Thu Jul 16 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"Its important to me to repeat not to use them, someone might see it and be helped.

Thetruthishere,3dgxci,of8dreams,4,Thu Jul 16 20:37:37 2015 UTC,"gosh not even sure where to start.. for years, had some terribly dark, perverted energy fuck with me from about 12-21. since I hit puberty, I had a negative entity in the home. I'm not sure where it came from. thinking in retrospect, part of me wonders if it was something my mom brought home (she called it, ""the black hole""). who knows. my family was not happy, so it could have been any of us.   it would BLAST me with fear, with neg vibes. the ""hub"" of this energy was in a closet in the master bedroom. I was terrified of it. just absolutely, irrationally terrified of this closet, the room itself, of any dark shadow, etc. and just out of the blue, id be paralyzed by this fear. just unable to move, so afraid. of nothing! just in my room alone. years of experiencing this terror, the constant feeling of being watched, being harassed in the shower. was touched a couple times, hand and shoulder I think. not painful but firm. recurring weird sex dreams. years of this.   I told a coupla people, my best friend, my mom, my bf.. only those closest to me. they really did not believe me. my boyfriend at the time would chide me.. one time, he was over and kind of making fun of me because I wanted to close the door of my room .. always needed to keep my doors shut. he knew I thought I was being haunted. so he made me keep the door open (to try and prove a point?) and the darkness poured in, it LOVED what my bf was making happen and taking advantage of it. not only was it blasting more fear onto me, but it was smirking while doing so. I eventually shut the door.   when I was 21, I made friends with someone who was experienced with getting rid of energy. we had not related any kind of paranormal stuff with each other, prior to him seeing my home/room and saying, there's something in the room with you. once he identified it, he got it to go away, right away. an immediate weight was lifted. no words or incantations or anything.   over the course of the next year or so, I absorbed more and more of what he was saying. my friend/mentor had a very strong spiritual presence I guess, he grew up with it too and learned to overcome it throughout the years. eventually we stopped talking.. we met by chance in very strange/transitional times in our lives. if I believe in fate, I'd say we met to for this teaching, and left when he had done his work. there are a lot of details I am leaving out regarding him and his teachings. not all of it was pleasant.   now I'm fine, I can identify the negs cuz I was familiar with that feeling for so long. and I think I am finally (95%?) able to handle anything that wanders this way. I don't give off the same emotions, which means I'm not as interesting to anything, so I don't get much. I'm not interested in attracting it tho.   I live in this house now by myself. I sleep in the master bedroom. no panic attacks or irrational fear paralysis. no weird sex dreams. part of me really does wonder if it was all the crazed, paranoid mind of a sad yet very imaginative teenage girl, and not some disgusting, evil entity. who knows? I know how I feel about it.   Jesus fuck this was long  TLDR: had a scary few years with an entity, can deal with it now thanks to a ghost buster I accidentally befriended. or I'm totally crazy."

But aside from being annoying, what power does he truly have over you?"

I am in the same boat as you at the moment. Try blessing the house, saying some prayers, put up crosses, ect. I know for sure you have to want to get rid of it.

Thetruthishere,3dgxci,poop_giggle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:09:17 2015 UTC,"truly, i say to you, when the demon said ""i won"" he is referring to breaking apart youre marriage and making neither you or your wife to forgive whatever was happening. demons make things and distractions happen to keep you down. if you and youre wife can honestly pray, with your meaningful hearts, it will go away. prayers are like smoke and fire. small prayers are weak and fizz out on their way to heaven, but real meaningful prayers are like a hot furnace reaching towards heaven and providing a barrier, it is so hot demons cannot stand to be near and they have to leave. so pray in the name of Christ, our Savior, ask Him to come into your life and ask Him and His angels for protection, repent of your sins and forgive your wife. keep praying even if there are distractions, be strong, this too will pass"
Thetruthishere,3dgxci,Radium_Coyote,4,Sun Jul 19 03:20:10 2015 UTC,"Ouji boards are no fuckin games, son. That shit is all too real. Pretty much avoid anything that deals with communicating with spirits on any level. Ouji boards, seances,  crystal balls, that pendulum crystal thing and depend on how you uses them, mirrors and candles,   Pentagrams, trying to use spells, a lot of stuff people think are simply games but can have serious consequences.   You got yourself a malevolent spirit. And a strong one at that. It's takes a powerful spirit to move physical objects. Even more so to reveal itself to someone.  And it's attached to you.    Better go seek a pastor or some spiritual leader.  And if it helps look up info on Ouji Boards. Can learn some stuff like you should always select ""goodbye"" when your done. Never set them on fire, never invite them in (as in ""if you're here/real then move/do this!"")  Pretty much Ouji boards were used in witchcraft which somewhere down the road someone mass produced these, labeled it as a child's game and sold it to the public. Bad move there."
Thetruthishere,3dgxci,alecz127,3,Thu Jul 16 10:49:46 2015 UTC,"I'm taking time out of my busy schedule of drinking a lot of alcohol to suggest that you disinterest me.

Thetruthishere,3dgxci,tpm_,3,Thu Jul 16 18:14:33 2015 UTC,"There is nothing evil about witchcraft. Ouija boards are not witchcraft nor are seances. Magic and spells are not evil unless the ""spells"" are outright about harmful in which case I wouldn't even consider it real magic anymore, more so something some random person made up and the only thing you're going to get by trying to ""cast"" it is probably going to kick you in the butt maybe attract ""demons"". Crystal balls, those pendulum things, are associated, but these aren't supposed to be used to contact spirits, it's a fortune telling thing like horoscopes and are meant to be taken with a grain of salt. Tarot cards same thing. People who use these tools to try to contact spirits or scare themselves are probably being taken advantage of by things that they are opening themselves up to by wanting contact or fear. But I wouldn't doubt this would occur with any tools or objects, or nothing at all. Real witchcraft is doing what you will as long as you don't hurt anyone including yourself which would include all Christian morals and other religious morals. Witchcraft is about the earth and nature being respected and sacred. Anything else isn't witchcraft. Pentacles are good and mean the for elements and soul. Pentagrams are evil and used by Satanists. I think satanists just took our symbol and reversed it. It makes some of us not even want to associate with pentacles anymore : /"

And there's this sort of phenomenon I guess you could call it that comes up when people do ouija. People all over the world seem to get the same being that seems to be really malevolent and malicious. Supposedly, it calls itself ""Zozo,"" ""Zoso"" or other ""Z"" names. Some people even think it's some ancient Assyrian demon that had a similar name...that's further speculation though. Supposedly one of the guys from Led Zeppelin contacted it as well and that's why one of the symbols for their albums is called ""Zoso.""  Anyway, enough tin foil hat stuff. I guess you could look up stuff about ""Zozo"" and see if it fits your experience and if you can do something about it that way. Or at the very least look up stuff about how to get rid of spirits.  And as other commenters said...don't fuck with ouija boards anymore. It's very hard to get good out of them."

He is providing an anchor for it to stay, and as long as he keeps doing that, you won't be able to get rid of it.  He has to WANT to get rid of it for a banishment to work.  If he's refusing to listen to reason, the only thing your mom and grandmother can do is protect themselves.  If it were me, I would either demand that he leave or I would leave.  He may or may not come to his senses and realize the danger.  Unless and until he does, there is nothing you can do for him.  I'm sorry.    I would suggest that at the very least, your mother and grandmother begin distancing themselves emotionally and psychologically from him.  Physical distance would be even better, but they may not be ready to take that step.  They should try to avoid strong emotion since that feeds it.  Are they religious at all?  If they are, they might want to focus on prayer and religious objects for their own strength and protection.   You have my sympathy, OP.  My own father has had something dark attached to him since before I was born.

Thetruthishere,3dffi6,Radium_Coyote,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:03:01 2015 UTC,Once he realizes he got himself in deep shit I think that will make him understand. That and when he finds out it didn't work. Don't know what he tried to do though.

What you need to know about folks as you describe is that when they double down, they double down HARD.  ""It didn't work"" translates into ""I didn't try hard enough"".  The hump point is when they realize ""There's no amount of trying that would have worked.""  So few people reach that point, I'm honestly sorry for him.  I don't have better advice.

Maybe you can show him some YouTube videos of people who dabbled in it, but now they changed their lives due to it ruining them. Show him some people's stories of negative experiences with it.  It's going to take A LOT of this, but I wouldn't let up.  I'd pound it into his head how dangerous it is. Any negative thing I see or read, I'd show it to him.  Other than that, pray if you pray."

Thetruthishere,3d8kic,Cheechmarieee,8,Tue Jul 14 10:09:14 2015 UTC,"I have a theory that when you watch a movie or show that is scary or about the paranormal, it opens your mind to being more perceptive of the paranormal; or it makes it easier for paranormal things to happen.   For example, we believe my house is haunted (but not the first haunted house we've lived in). Whenever i watch shows like Ghost Adventures or a paranormal podcast, i always get that creeping neck feeling at random times. (I don't watch scary movies cause I'm chicken). I think this is energy feeding off my emotions/energy to make itself known. Or it may be curious as to ways it could communicate with this world/dimension, just like we're curious to do the same. When i watch podcasts with headphones, there is a normal amount of activity. If i listen out loud, things seem to happen more.  It could be that your cousins brought a visitor with them, or maybe all of yalls energy together (strong energy in your fearful states) helped something make itself known"

Things in this house have never been to bad (the house i grew up in was crazy active, but i believe it was because my brother and i were living together). I always talk to Tom (the spirit told my dad that was his name). I am always vocal about them not trying to scare us.  I really hate the idea of saging or cleansing houses. Where do the spirits go? What if there are innocent spirits that get kicked out when someone is mass cleaning their home? Are they left to wander this plane of existence alone forever?

Their entire form was covered in the same color, no splotches or anything, and they were not transparent at all. They were perfect silhouettes, however they didn't seem to have any clothing on (or at least any clothing that would alter the normal human shape). They did move a bit strangely at times (sort of stiff), and occasionally they would simply stand in the same place, (seemingly) staring off into the distance.

If I had not seen something I still would have no reason to lie because I'm like a lot of us, searching for the TRUTH."
Thetruthishere,3csa4a,alwystired,2,Mon Jul 13 07:50:29 2015 UTC,There are things I've seen that could be explained but that I can't explain. But just because I saw a dark figure once at a cemetery at night doesn't mean I saw a spirit. Maybe I did.
Thetruthishere,3csa4a,zorro1701e,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:49:55 2015 UTC,"Right. I agree. Very good point. What I saw was unexplainable in every way BUT something paranormal. Therefore it is paranormal in my opinion. However, I rarely talk about it because it only proves something to me.  I had to see it myself to believe as do most people I assume."
Thetruthishere,3csa4a,alwystired,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:59:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing, I have heard a few stories similar to this, with people experiencing the same thing in different places at the same time, especially when involving the death of someone close to them. It's very strange and interesting, definitely something I would like to investigate a bit more, and perhaps bring up on the show."

Knowledge of SSTV only really became widespread when they used it as a promotional gimmick for Portal.  But just imagine, you're driving along in a dark spot, middle ofthe  night, miles and miles away from the nearest anything, and your radio picks up a lone signal, and it's just modem noises.  But you know, modem noises mean someone's saying something.  You wonder what, you wonder who, you wonder why, and eventually you get around to wondering where... and it's when you act on that wonder, that shit goes weird."

Thetruthishere,3csa4a,halfbreed69,6,Sun Jul 12 17:49:28 2015 UTC,"When I was nearly 12, barely a month into grade 7, I had a terrible nightmare. I was walking to school and when I crossed the last street I needed to, I looked to my left and a small white car was coming right for me. I woke up right before impact.  I was pretty shaken that morning as I got ready for school. So much so, in fact, that I asked my mom for a ride to school. She rolled her eyes, told me to not be so lazy and it was gorgeous out. So I walked.  I met up with my friend on the way and we went together. I probably should have taken an alternate route, but this was the fastest and most direct way to school. When we got to the crosswalk from my dream, I stopped for a bit longer than usual and thoroughly checked both ways before crossing. This is the crosswalk on the left-hand side. They didn't have that other crosswalk there when I was a kid.  I got a few feet out and looked both ways again, and when I looked to my left there was a small white car speeding toward me. I don't remember anything between this point and waking up on the road to my stepdad's tear-streaked face above me.  But we had a friend waiting on the other side of the crosswalk for us, and one of my other friend's dads was outside his house about to go to work a few houses down the street, who witnessed the entire thing. My friend's dad called my parents, which is why my stepdad was there when I gained consciousness.  I guess the friend I was with in the crosswalk turned to run the wrong way, so I pushed her out of the way and she got clipped by the corner of the bumper and got a bruise on her hip. I took the full impact, broke my left leg in several places, was thrown 50 feet, landed on my left shoulder and completely shattered it and then my head hit the pavement and bounced. I have lingering physical disabilities because of this, and a permanent bump on my head (but no brain damage, thankfully).  It took a long time for my mom to forgive herself for not driving me to school. I've never held any grudge about it myself, and I know that if it had been my friend who was hit... her injuries would have been far worse, she might have even died. I was an athletic child built of solid muscle, a runner, swimmer and volleyball player. I wasn't small by any means, which kind of worked out in my favour since the growth plate fused in my left leg when it healed, so I had to get my right leg surgically broken to fuse that growth plate together as well. My legs stopped growing at 12 as a result, while my torso grew. I'm not weirdly proportioned, you wouldn't even notice unless I point it out, but both of my knees are shot and I can barely use my left arm. I wasn't an athlete anymore, clearly. Managed to get to 5'7"", probably would have been 5'10"" or so if my legs' growth hadn't been arrested.  Anyway, that was one of the weirdest things that ever happened to me, I dreamed of the future and it sucked."
Thetruthishere,3csa4a,Full_Metalix,2,Sun Jul 12 19:46:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing, such a strange story. I hope to use this on the show. I've had a few stories sent to me regarding premonitions, so I may hold this back and do a show, or at least a segment of a show all about this kind of thing.

Thetruthishere,3csa4a,duggy87,5,Sun Jul 12 21:38:45 2015 UTC,"The weirdest event of my life and one I have absolutely no answers for is a day I was feeling uncomfortable because of the heat and thinking about turning on a fan at the other side of the room.  It was a simple desk fan no remotes and you had to push one of the three buttons down physically on it.  The whole story really is it turned on itself just as I was thinking about getting up to turn it on, I should probably add I had a friend over who was also on the same side of the room as me and was a bit freaked out by the incident as well.  To this day he thinks I tricked him somehow but I didn't and have no explanation apart from at the time the fan tuning on seemed really out of proportion honestly important to me, I've never been able to repeat the stunt at times I've tried just because I do now believe it's possible.  Result is I believe in telekinesis or maybe the mind having a big effect on reality itself but don't really believe in anything else."

These events took place in the early 90's, when we were all in our mid 20's.  My cousin R, and her BFF D, have been friends since they were toddlers. I am a few years older than both of them.  They both grew up got married and wound ujp buying homes across the street from each other after they married and had kids.  Now D's little brother didn't get along with his stepdad so he lived with D and her family until he went to college a few towns over. Now D's brother had a really ugly red and green checked couch in his room. D decided to get rid of it so she asked R if she wanted it. R said yes and they had the husbands tote it across the street, and set it in the garage (R planned to reupholster it). There it sat for a few weeks.  R worked second shift and came in one night to find D's little brother asleep on the couch. She really thought nothing about it, went inside and went to bed.Upon getting up the brother was gone. She later decided to go to D's for coffee and to tease the brother for sleeping in her garage. They had no sooner sat down for coffee when the phone rang. It was D's mother calling to tell her that her brother had been run down and killed by a drunk driver on his way from class the night before."

There was one girl who I played with that had a large doll house that her father had made I believe. It was a huge house, fully furnished with nearly a dozen rooms and an attic. The doll house was probably 2 or 3 feet tall by about the same wide. It was sized for barbies and we'd play with them sometimes. I remember nearly every time we played with them and put them down to do something else (watch a video, play a different game or whatever else) when we came back they'd be in a different position.   I remember one time that we were curious as to why they did this so we took one of the barbie dolls and put it against a screen window a few feet away from the bed. Then we went away for about 20 or so minutes and came back to her room. The doll was now under a blanket that was at the foot of her bed. It was odd to say the least."

The morning i was going back home, i woke up knowing that my dad was about to open the door and tell me the bad news that she had passed. One minute goes by, rest assured my dad knocks and starts crying. It feels like she wanted me to remember her while she still looked healthy and not lying in a hospital bed."
Thetruthishere,3cmz7r,bigbuzd1,7,Thu Jul 9 04:25:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't have any dreams, but had those 'feelings' before.  Had them for both my parents.  For dad it was in 2001.  I was walking with my future wife around the neighborhood.  As we passed the local fire station the ambulance and rescue truck started rolling out.  I told he I thought they were going to get my dad, even though he was fine earlier.  We walked the couple blocks back to the house and there they were.  He had broken his hip.  For mom, it was almost 6 years later.  My wife and I were over the road drivers and we were in Delaware, where my family is from, but we lived in Florida.  I just had a gut feeling to get home, but we were too far to just drive empty.  30 minutes later the truck company begs me to take a 60 mile run that all the other driver in the area refused.  They told me they would pay for our gas to drive home to Florida if we took it.  I didn't ask them for that, this was their first offer.  We were in Florida by the next afternoon.  Mom was fine, I took her for sushi and crab legs and a ride in the big truck, which she really enjoyed.  I couldn't figure out why I had such strong feelings of dread, to get home as fast as I could, because everything was fine.  I made plans to take her to see dad's grave in 2 days even.  Well, she never made it there...not in the way I wanted her to.  The next morning she tripped over her cat, cracked her head open on a kitchen table...a table I removed several months prior because of the pointed corners, which she had put back in there.  She ended up bleeding to death after being unable to reach any of the emergency pull cords."

My birth mom actually selected them after getting to know them.  I was fortunate enough to have been reunited with my bio mom and she was able to meet both of them again when I was 26....quite a few years ago, and she was able to thank them for raising me so well.  I just recently met my bio-dad a little over a year ago, as well.  Bio parents and I have a very strong connection (those 'feelings' I was talking about) whereas my adoptive parents never understood what I meant when I tried to explain.  So even though I lost the ones who raised me, I feel I'm fortunate to have found my birth parents...it helps."

I knew my father was dying in the hospital, but I wasn't able to be there. I was up late, upset and crying and trying to  pass the time until about two o'clock in the morning when I suddenly got very calm and realized I should go to sleep, because he had died.  I called the hospital the next morning and indeed, his time of death had been at two in the morning. I would chalk it up to coincidence except for the emotions involved in it. I went from very frazzled and crying, upset.... to just calm and sleepy. Like a switch."

What I was most expecting was either a critical medical thing with my dad (which I had no reason to expect--other than being up in age, he's healthy) or the daycare my dog goes to telling me she got in a horrible fight and needed emergency surgery or something.  The feeling was so strong that I kept my phone with me the entire time I was riding, which I NEVER do.  I never even take it into the barn, it stays in my car.

Thetruthishere,3cmz7r,msurveycorps,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:13:24 2015 UTC,"I've posted this before, but someone suggested I add it to this subreddit.  When I first started dating my fiance 10 years ago, he was telling me about his family since I would be spending Thanksgiving with them for the first time. While he was telling me about his grandfather (whom he loved very much) a thought popped into my head: ""He's going to die this year."" The thought was in my own voice and it was instant as if I knew this for certain. I felt terrible at the time for thinking such a thing and didn't know where that could have come from.  Fast forward about 8 months and his grandfather is very ill and living at home with a 24/hour nurse. He had cancer and the family knew that he would pass away any day. His grandfather seemed to accept this and didn't seem to want to linger. We lived in another state and didn't get a chance to visit him at this time. One night I had a dream that I was sitting on a hospital bed in a dimly lit bedroom of a private home. Next to me, a man was lying under the covers, but I didn't see his face. I was sitting by his head, looking towards the foot of the bed.  In the dream I said, ""your hours are up. Shall I write them?""  The man replied ""Yes. Write them.""  I'm not sure if he meant for me to write a letter to his family or to write his hours (whatever that means). I reached across him to the nightstand where there is a pad and pencil. Before I grab them, however, I woke up. I didn't just open my eyes,I woke up in the dramatic way people do in movies when they are having a nightmare; gasping and sitting up quickly. I wasn't afraid or anything, I just woke up as if I had been yelled at or startled. After a second or two I get my bearings and I realize that my boyfriend's cell phone is vibrating on the other side of the room. I go get it and see that his mother is calling. I knew instantly why she was calling at 2 in the morning. I shake my boyfriend awake and let him answer the phone. He got the news that his grandfather passed away that night.  I suppose that's why his grandfather came to me, to make sure that his grandson got the call. My boyfriend doesn't believe in anything paranormal and out of respect while he was grieving, I didn't tell him about it for months."

It was when the ""Help me"" was uttered that freaked me out. To give you a better idea of the breathing I heard before forcing Ben to hang up, it sounded almost like growling (or at least it sounded much more aggressive).   This would be a first for me personally. I used to hear footsteps upstairs as a kid and thought I saw a white form follow my sister in the darkness of the patio at night (also as a kid). I had chalked it up to me being a child with a very vivid imagination. Haven't experienced anything until today.  I've had a number of friends mention how they get bad vibes from my house, before mentioning any stories to them. Which I don't get because my house is actually quite bright and welcoming as far as appearances go."

Maybe my friends are bigger pansies than I am!  Nothing negative really happened in the house outside of the mentioned situations. My sister (the one who saw the shadow as a kid) saw a man wearing a black hat (Hat Man?) in the middle of the highway one night and spun out (almost hitting a guard rail) trying to avoid him, luckily the highway had zero traffic at that time. Maybe this has to do with my sister messing with a ouija board with her friend when we were kids?"

I am going to go against the grain a bit and say that as of now you should not try to get a exorcist; As it seems rather frightening but unable or unwilling to do much more then to give bad vibes.   Kinda like a very angry chihuahua. However you may want to look into the history of the house and land it is on as well as surrounding land. If it at all turns hostile I hear that sage is good to ward off spirits both neutral and evil. Also if you do believe in a religion you may want to invest in a symbol of that religion. cross necklace and/or bible if your christian. Unsure of what the Muslim equivalent of a cross necklace would be but a kuran should work just as fine as a bible. Any type of statue or symbol meant to ward off evil does well as well. Like Buddhist/Shinto Dōsojins."

To quote one of my favorite authors, ""When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.""   She wouldn't leave until I showed the saloon with my hand ""right there"". She left.   You did a spirit a solid, and you should be every inch filled with pride that you did a spirit a good deed.  She needed someone to show her a path to a further goal, and you did that.  It's not a small tribute to your character that she trusted you."

Thetruthishere,3cc3vn,happy_fart_man,5,Tue Jul 7 15:52:22 2015 UTC,"What kind of advice do you need? Do you need any advice? Advice for what? I believe your experiences. I don't think they need to be analyzed or anything like that. Is your ability to function impaired? The best advice I can give is to not build narratives based off of your experiences. Do not try to 'create an explanation' for things. That can lead to delusional beliefs and stories for things. Be aware, do not overthink or 'explain away' the what and the why of personal experiences that you don't understand. Accept them and also accept you may not understand them and also accept that 'culture' may find them 'unusual.' I can gather that you are sensitive, that you can pass the veil of the mundane and sacred, as it were, but be careful with trying to over-understand something.   I have similar experiences. I think what's most important in life is being aware and being understanding and empathetic to other beings. If you have deep experiences that others may not relate to, no big deal. There are some out there that have similiar experiences though. Learn what you can from everything and use it in your life.   I also would reccommend avoiding psychologists or therapists. Not that they are bad people. but it is a really shitty platform to seek help from. If you want real human intimacy and understanding, seek help from real connection.  You ask ""what could it be?"" It's being human. It's not anything specific. Everyone has different experiences. I would try not to think about what it could be. But if it helps, journal about things or draw pictures about it, and then maybe share it with others. I'm sure it will resonate with somebody on a soul-level."

She also said they are not recurring events and that they are not disrupting my life. I'm also confused by other people who were present during certain experiences (I wrote one example above).

This one has been sighted around the time period you describe. Not sure if its in the same area. Was it anything like this?  Of course there is the possibility that the object you saw was part of a top secret government military program. I have the feeling a lot of the sightings that are truely unexplained might be either military or some type of hoax. What u/screamingfryingpan suggests is also plausible. Other than the civilian airport, are there any military bases in the area? Can you confirm the sighting from other eye witnesses?

The things that bother me with the standard 'secret military project' idea are 1) there are claims these go way farther back than they should to make sense, but even discounting those, 2) why on earth would some secret project plane fly over the most populated areas they could find? It just doesn't fit with the 'secret' part. Someone suggested that there might be some kind of surveillance going on with them, and that could explain the high-population part, but all told they're kind of a mystery."

I do believe in alien visitors coming to earth with their technology, not ruling anything out. It could be one of their UFO crafts.  Most UFOs seen here in the US can be classified under our own secretive military crafts. Did you see my link at the bottom?  Check out the video and tell me what you think?  Go to 5:35 on video."

If they ARE terrestrial stealth craft, and in my opinion that's very likely, they're something very new and different compared to the existing ""flying wings"" which, despite having an unusual shape and a delayed sound, are still nothing but jets."

However, it might be possible that, while new military aircraft testing is happening, other types of tests might have been carried out as well.

I really didn't think much of it at first, aside from the fact that it seemed weird to be traveling 40mph and outpacing a plane.  Anyway, she made a wrong turn and we approached it's path.  I was eager to get a closer look, but didn't say anything and she was initially just preoccupied with the wrong turn.     As we got closer to it, she noticed it too.  It passed over the road right in front of us and I saw the black outline of a triangle with concave sides silhouetted against the sky.  I remember her saying ""What is that?  What IS that?  AnOdorlessGas.  WHAT IS THAT?"" as we turned off the radio and lowered the windows.  She parked the car on the side of the road, near a little farmer's vegetable stand, partially to stop and watch and partially to turn the car around.  The damn thing stopped dead in the air it crossed the road, dropped about 10 feet straight down (assuming I was correct in my guess of 25 feet altitude), before changing direction and flying right over our car.    Freaking weird."

Thetruthishere,3c42ye,theendishigh,5,Sun Jul 5 18:32:38 2015 UTC,"I see ghosts as being the ""lower self"" - part of our subconscious that gets lost after death. If you are having experiences then they are using your beliefs and energy to create those experiences. It would be your beliefs that are attracting them and giving them purchase. When you say fighting or laughing it is still reinforcing the patterns of belief so neither would be a ""solution""."
Thetruthishere,3c42ye,heron27,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:54:03 2015 UTC,That's an interesting way to look at it! It's really the type of subject that everyone has a unique point of view on. It makes sense that if one were to react then it would be feeding into whatever existence the spirit has.

Thetruthishere,3c42ye,kinetic-passion,3,Sun Jul 5 11:51:39 2015 UTC,"I believe it wouldn't be that simple. Those ""ghosts"" are like strangers with attitude. Like a robber who's not supposed to be in your house but has specific intention you can't instantly predict. I think they tend to show up with one dominant character and mood with them, like sad, angry, peaceful or snarling. And chances are you'd feel what they want you to feel. Ghosts are probably like people who are really into their characters. Unlike humans who can change from one attitude/trait/character to another, or as we say it, 'people change.'"
Thetruthishere,3c42ye,kinetic-passion,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:18:55 2015 UTC,"It makes sense that a ghost would maintain a certain emotion. If they really are able to make a living person feel something, I wonder if they do it on purpose or not."

It worked I think, I don't feel that energy anymore."
Thetruthishere,3c42ye,loveistruth,2,Mon Jul 6 20:55:51 2015 UTC,It's really cool that whatever it was responded to you being assertive! And even better that you don't have to deal with it anymore.

Thetruthishere,3c42ye,cihuacoatl,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:37:24 2015 UTC,Has it worked for you?
Thetruthishere,3c42ye,butteryoatmeal,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:08:44 2015 UTC,"The ""leave me alone"" thing most people have mentioned works most of the time, provided the spirit is not interested in you personally.  It depends on the purpose/nature of the spirit.    Take for example, the situation with my ex.  Shortly after we met, I found out about his ex who had died in a car crash.  This came up after I told him about the lovely dream I had in which at one point a woman I didn't know glared at me and stared me down.  I described her to him, and then he told me about her and that he was worried that would happen, as she had harassed the two girlfriends he'd had since her passing.  I later came to find out that she had been actively haunting him as well.    I'm not going to go into my history or anything beyond the scope of this story, but when I told him I was going to get rid of her, he said his exes had tried and it didn't work.  I don't know what they tried, and there's no need to go over the altercation in detail, because there wasn't much of a confrontation or laughing at her or telling off like you alluded to in your question.  It was more like we both know what we're here for and I'm here to kick your *** out.  On both sides.  The next day when I saw him, he was shocked BC he hadn't seen or heard from her, and apparently didn't think I could get rid of her.    It was then that I realized I had fallen in love with him, because I knew that I wouldn't have had the strength to win that fight otherwise.    That being said, that was a personal matter.  To address your question in a more generic and appropriate way, you cannot just confront a sport, you have to be prepared both in terms of knowing exactly what you're dealing with and in terms of strength and resistance to the challenges and risks the spirit may bring your way.  So, with regards to personal strength, you must first have control of your own thoughts, both so that you can channel your strengths and so that you can tell when someone's trying to mess with your mind.  The basic starting exercise for this is to clear your mind and think of nothing.  The challenge here is control over the urge to fill the silence with ""I'm thinking of nothing!"" Or thoughts about your breathing.  Once you manage to work past that to where you can clear your mind for a good minute, establishing control over your thoughts (if you're squeamish or weak stomached, this will help you a lot to that end),  You must also, once you have mastered the first, learn how to protect yourself.  If you want to pursue that once you've become master of your own mind, feel free to pm me, or you could post in /r/energywork and ask perhaps about a basic aura shield, although no two people may tell you the same thing.     To recap, to confront a spirit or entity of any kind, you must know exactly what you are up against, as much as possible, have control of your own mind so you can be sharp and know when someone is messing with you, and know most importantly how to defend and protect yourself (to which clearing your mind is a precursor).    Only then, can you prepare the appropriate offensive strategy for the specific encounter."
Thetruthishere,3c42ye,butteryoatmeal,2,Sun Jul 5 19:51:32 2015 UTC,"I've never heard anything like your experience before! It's great that you were able to work through that. As for the advice, although it's appreciated I don't actually have any spirits I'm trying to deal with or get rid of. I only asked out of curiosity :) but if anything pops up I'll be sure to keep what you've said in mind!"

Good people tend to be benevolent spirits.  Bad people, such as murderers tend to be angry and often violent spirits.  They can also affect how they are perceived (i.e., demons, dark malevolent entities, etc.).  I'm not sure that laughing at a dark spirit would be a good idea - I've never tried it."

Even at that time I remember realizing they looked like sprites from video games (essentially two dimensional images that are perpetually facing you) but for some reason it never scared me. It did naturally stop happening by the time I was 7 or 8 so maybe this could be related?

Thetruthishere,3btb59,s70n3834r,28,Thu Jul 2 20:08:31 2015 UTC,It's a guy wearing a hoody with a pair of glasses on.
Thetruthishere,3btb59,jonleepettimore,7,Thu Jul 2 00:54:34 2015 UTC,Looked at the photo before even scrolling down to the comments and that's exactly what I saw. I don't understand how this isn't obvious. OP didn't remember him because he probably wasn't distinguishable from the hundreds of others in the photo. Normal dude with glasses in a red and black hoody.
Thetruthishere,3btb59,rvm4488,16,Thu Jul 2 06:48:45 2015 UTC,"He's looking down at his phone. Head angled down, why the nose is in a weird spot, someone else pointed out probably sometime of glasses and they reflected light. If you look on the right in the second row you can see two people at the end in a Sinclair stance."
Thetruthishere,3btb59,dinosaursatwork,3,Thu Jul 2 02:20:01 2015 UTC,but his arms don't seem to be in a position of holding a phone in the way you would when looking at it
Thetruthishere,3btb59,AshamedPakiHenna,7,Thu Jul 2 08:24:56 2015 UTC,It is interesting. The fact that you don't remember him is interesting. He has a large back and an odd stance. The shadow on his face is odd compared to those around him. I don't know how much of a shadow a hoodie would cast.   A guy looking at his phone  with the reflection off of his glasses is a good theory. Never rule anything out regardless. Wonder if he will show up at your next show?
Thetruthishere,3btb59,Stoneegg,7,Thu Jul 2 03:29:38 2015 UTC,"He wasn't there at the next show, which was a long way away up in Seattle.  We don't have a theory about him, and I'm not sure I see the guy looking at his phone with light reflecting from his glasses. Maybe I can see the light reflecting bit, but that still doesn't really explain the rest of him and how he looks.   It was also really hot. Look at everyone around him. T-shirts, tank tops, etc. it looks like he's wearing some Jon Snow type of coat and thick hood. Completely out of place."
Thetruthishere,3btb59,Stoneegg,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:31:37 2015 UTC,I agree with you. I was just at the show tonight and it reminded me of the robes that the stage hands wear during the show. It would be really out of place and the odd stain on the hood is hard to explain. There was also a comment on the facebook page by one of the fans stating that he did not see this individual. If this being was not witnessed by those around him that would be strange. I noticed everyone around me. As others have said on here it would be great if we could contact someone who was around at the time especially that woman standing next to this individual.   The show that King Diamond puts on is powerful and lyrics and symbols attract things. Since it is similar to doing a ritual or spells. Kind of like how people use prayers or hymns.
Thetruthishere,3btb59,The1980s,9,Wed Jul 8 06:43:58 2015 UTC,Man that guy/thing looks scary. Looks like blood all over his clothes and his eyes are glowing. Dude behind him looks like he's holding a big ass dagger too.

Maybe ""Death"" is there to carry his victim's soul over to the other side. This is all VERY metal."
Thetruthishere,3btb59,sniggity,7,Thu Jul 2 12:37:34 2015 UTC,"As I said over at /r/humanoidencounters there is also a shadow person in this pic too.

Next to him is a guy in white with his arms in the air, in the middle of those two there looks to be a shadow person standing really close to the guy in blue."

Thetruthishere,3bofev,the_denizen,6,Tue Jun 30 21:10:26 2015 UTC,"wow that is creepy and reminds me of a story that was told to me while I was serving on the USS Harry S Truman...   Some context... I was an Aviation Ordnanceman working in the ammo magazines on the ship.  These are 4-5 rooms stacked on top of each other and to get to each room you have to go up and down a straight ladder.  When you stop at the magazine you want you are in a small area about 6ft x 6ft with a door leading to the actual magazine.  This area is called the trunk and when you stop on your floor your back is always to the door.    Well I am pretty terrified of ghost stories (especially at this time in my life) and one of my supervisors decided to tell me a story that would scare me every time I went down to the magazines to check the temperatures (a daily responsibility).  Not always but sometimes the water tight doors for these magazines have port holes in them.    He tells me that when he was onboard the USS Enterprise he had a very frightening experience he could not explain.  He was on his way to 7th deck (pretty down in the depths of the ship) to check the temps and when he stepped off the ladder and turned to unlock the door he was feet away from a man he described as a old hippy looking guy with long hair, a very long beard, and the man was just staring at my supervisor.   The thing is there were 2 ways in and out of this magazine (main entrance and emergency escape) and the only way to get IN to the magazines is with the key... they key my supervisor had checked out.    Well after a few seconds of staring at each other the man in the window turned away from my friend, walked to the back of the magazine and disappeared into the wall.  Didnt walk through a door, didn't go poof into thin air, literally walked into and through the wall.    My supervisor noped the hell out of there and ran back to get the LPO and tell him that there was a security risk on the ship.  His LPO said ""Oh, thats so and so... he died 20 years ago in the magazine when ship yard workers screwed up and he died of exposure to a lethal gas (The sewage system on the ship contains a chemical that if leaked into the air is very lethal very quickly) inside that magazine.    The LPO went on to say he likes to scare the new guys.    My supervisor said he refused to go to that magazine for the rest of his time on that ship and even requested to be transfered to a different magazine group on the same ship.    I was told that story 12 years ago and it freaked me out everytime I had to go into a mag with a port hole in the door."
Thetruthishere,3bofev,RedShirtDecoy,3,Wed Jul 1 21:08:15 2015 UTC,"As someone with an interest in military history, I find your story fascinating. That isn't to say my heart wouldn't jump out of my chest if put in the same situation."
Thetruthishere,3bofev,RedShirtDecoy,3,Wed Jul 1 21:27:45 2015 UTC,Luckily it didn't happen to me and the Truman was so new at the time that the number of deaths on board was very low compared to some of the older carriers.  So fewer paranormal things took place on our ship.  I never personally saw or felt anything and the only story going around when I was there was that the laundry room was haunted.  It gets hot down there and some guy passed out waiting in line to use a washer and hit his head just the wrong way on the last step.  The rumor was that he showed up when only one person was down there.    If you are interested in stuff like this do some reading on the USS Enterprise (CVN-65) and google all the ghost stories from her.  Not only did people pass over time but the ship was also host to a very large fire in 1968 that killed 28 people.  Definitely worth googling. I'm sure the Forestall would have some similar stories.

Thetruthishere,3bms49,ATROX_Beats,7,Tue Jun 30 14:04:27 2015 UTC,"Usually I'd suggest that these could be different entities and that you are just sensitive to spirits, but the hauntings sound pretty consistent.  Ghosts following a person is rare, but possible.  Spirits can attach themselves to objects, so consider the things you've taken with you from house to house.  The fact that the spirit sounds like your father could hint at it being a dead relative - we often have similar sounding voices to our relatives, because we pick up accents and slang. Spirits of close friends and relatives can and will sometimes follow you.  If you feel the entity is malicious, a psychic or medium may be able to help you. You should contact them if you feel that you're in danger. Protect yourself with talismans and articles of your faith if you have one. Smudge the house with sage to cleanse it."
Thetruthishere,3bms49,LittleSpits,2,Tue Jun 30 14:51:05 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily feel like I'm in danger, but after so many years of not experiencing anything, to have whatever this is come back is pretty unnerving. One of the things that gets me is that, like you said, the events that have been happening lately strike an uncanny resemblance to things that happened at our old house. The thing that scares me more than anything, though, is that it touched me. Is that like an explicit sign of malicious intent or could it just be nothing? I mean, it was a pretty intense tug at my ankle. It felt like two hands grabbing my leg and pulling back under the chair I was sitting on. Does that have any implicit meaning?"
Thetruthishere,3bms49,LittleSpits,2,Tue Jun 30 15:24:56 2015 UTC,"Being touched by an entity isn't necessarily malicious. Some are just trying to get your attention, some are doing what they would have done in life, some are trying to help, some are trying to hurt. There was a story of a man in the war who was shaken awake by the spirit of his brother in order to move him away from a place of danger, so physical contact isn't necessarily bad.  It would depend on the outcome of the contact – were you hurt? Did it feel like an attack or a joke? Did anything happen in that area after you left? It could have been the spirit simply trying to attract attention, which is quite a common report when people believe there are ghosts about.  Do you have anything in your possession now that you had when the experiences started?"
Thetruthishere,3bms49,dc668012,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:37:52 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can think of is the racecar bed. The side panels of the bed are in the attic of the house I believe. And to answer your other question, I wasn't physically hurt, like I didn't have any marks on me after the contact and nothing was sore, but like I said, it was a pretty intense grab and pull. It didn't feel playful, but that may have been because I was so startled, so I don't know."
Thetruthishere,3bms49,thebigsplat,5,Tue Jun 30 15:55:09 2015 UTC,"Ok the only bit of advice I have comes from seeing a ton of scary movies, lol go to the old house and dig in the spot where your dog would scratch"
Thetruthishere,3bms49,kinetic-passion,4,Tue Jun 30 17:22:28 2015 UTC,Call your parents. There might be more about what happened the last time that they know but didn't tell you because of your age
Thetruthishere,3bms49,elykittytee,2,Thu Jul 2 07:00:40 2015 UTC,"sounding like your father could either make it a dead relative or something malicious trying to trick you.  There's also the question of whether the thing making the voices and the blue man are one in the same.  If not, then the first, talking spirit, may be attached to a family object that you moved with, and the second, blue spirit, may be attached to the new house, since it didn't appear until you moved.  If they are one in the same, it highlights the question of why did they leave you alone until your brother grew old enough to walk and talk and be understood?  If its a dead relative, maybe it wants to send a message to your father by scaring his young children?  maybe someone who didn't approve of the marriage?  other than that, I have no idea.    did you take anything from the first house when you moved that was not yours before then, meaning that you found in the house (and you as in the whole family).  because if its not attached to a family item, the other explanation for following you would be that you happened to take the item it is attached to from the other house.    Scratching the center of the basement made me think something was buried under the old house, but if that were the case, the spirit wouldn't have followed you to a new house.  so that is not likely the case."
Thetruthishere,3bndsv,goredan,7,Tue Jun 30 16:43:45 2015 UTC,"When I was in the Marines, a friend gave me a pair of black fuzzy dice which I'd hang on my tank's Commander's Sight Extension for luck. Ever since I added those dice, I had an uncommonly frequent series of malfunctions no matter which tank I was commanding (you often crew different vehicles). Eventually, I just threw them into the desert and my run of bad luck ended.   It's probably just in my head, but tankers are notoriously superstitious."

In any case, it's certainly possible that you were used to lend dreamtime assistance. Given your perception of your family at the bottom of the cliff, you certainly weren't localized with them in the Dreaming, and the landscape imagery suggests a proximity with the Outer.

Same appearance you've described and I get the same feelings too. People in my thread thought it's a residual haunting because it only comes into a certain room, does the same things under certain circumstances, and then disappears by morning. The one in my home doesn't seem to be aware that I'm there at all and I've been told it probably doesn't mean me harm. The feelings when it's around or going to appear make me feel otherwise though. One of the first conclusions I've come to is it's feeding off energy, or feeding off fear/etc so it can manifest better. Not feeling those things is easier said than done, I know. I'm going to take the suggestion I was given which was burning white sage in my home, spreading the smoke around with doors and windows open, asking it to leave me be and move on. I've been told saying the name of Jesus can help too, that may depend on personal beliefs."

(Has never looked at me though when coming in my room and doing its spooky business.) I'm trying not to outside of telling my fiancee and my mom, like speaking about it will give it power. I saw it in a dream for the first time last night which made me really scared, like  my mind and dreamland should be my own territory if my own room isn't. I got really sick to my stomach just typing about it and thinking about it. I sleep with lights on like a kid for peace of mind. Someone suggested I try to get its attention by saying something but I'm afraid that's opening a scary can of worms. Have you said anything to yours?"

It's the one area of the house that actually feels safe. My roommate actually started sleeping in my room because of it.  I haven't tried saying anything to him yet. I'm way too chicken shit to.

Can't even distinguish a gender but I assume male from the height and plain build. I'm going to try some good old amateur detective work to see if I can find out more about the people who owned the home before we did. I found out someone had died here but details weren't given because it was past the 3 year disclosure law in CA. Going to see what I can find about names, maybe an obituary."

First off it's not an ""it,"" but rather a him or a her. Or at least what ever is there that is left of them. All spirits were once living beings at some point. I like to think of ghosts as people without bodies. Now the feelings you feel from him are his own and not yours. Entities can have a huge impact on the minds of the living and it is important to distinguish your own emotions from theirs. When they make you feel like them is when they can ""feed."" So you need to keep a strong mind about you when dealing with him. Second don't burn any sage or anything like that. While this can work temporarily it can also be seen as offensive and can lead to bigger problems. Be polite but be firm and simply tell them this is not their home, or this world and that there is nothing here for them and it's time to move on. This will only work if you don't give in to their negative emotions. I've never once had this fail when done properly. It should be noted that if someone else in the house continues to give in his negative emotions he will continue to stay."

This tends to be depression, anxiety disorder (general and social). It's those issues that make a person weak minded that have to be addressed. Which sadly isn't the easiest thing for someone to do. The best advice really is ""stay positive,"" as simple as that may seem."
Thetruthishere,3bf97f,watporque,20,Sun Jun 28 18:21:02 2015 UTC,"Talk to it. From the behavior, it's probably an old senile tenant. Happens all the time. It's probably shaking the door at night because that's its old room and it's confused as to why the door won't open. It's probably turning doorknobs because it wants to use the bathroom or make a sandwich.  Obviously it can hear you, since it quit messing with the doorknob when you told it to stop. That also shows it's courteous and listens to instructions. Whenever the cat starts freaking out again, or whenever it's ""active"" just talk to it. Like a normal human being. ""Hi, what's your name?"" ""What are you doing?"" etc. Now be very quiet, and you'll probably hear it answer.  Senile old farts get stuck as ghosts all the time, pretty much because they don't realize they're dead. Calmly explain it to him/her. They usually take it rather well, all things considered, and then move on. Sometimes they want to stay, too, which I personally don't see the harm in - in that case, just lay down some house rules like ""No messing around after 10pm"" and ""Please don't scare the guests"". Give them some place to call their own - a small altar or just a nice comfy chair in front of the TV. If they get obnoxious, just tell them to knock it off as if they were any other roomate.  This stuff happens. Hollywood has gotten everyone all scared about the supernatural with hundreds of movies about evil restless spirits and demons. The vast majority of spirits are quite mundane. It's just downright silly to get scared over a few moving chairs and a couple doors moving at night."

This was 16 years ago, my boyfriend (now husband) and I left a party to go take a drive down to a local beach.  The road into this beach is long with low open land where you can see for a long distance until the final turn into the beach parking lot, where there are high dunes and you can't see over them prior to making the turn.  We were actually leaving the beach area, got around the turn and onto the straight road.  An older truck passed us headed in the opposite direction toward the parking lot.  Just after the truck passed us, a small animaL ran out in the road in front of us.  I thought we might have hit it, and asked my husband to turn around to check.  He did a three point turn and we headed back toward the parking lot. No dead animal in the road, but the weird thing was there was no sign of the truck that had just passed us.  There were no roads off the beach road, the truck was not in the beach parking lot, and we could see that it had not driven off road on the straight area of the road.  Neither of us could explain where it had gone."

About 13 years ago I was at a friends cottage (more like a trailer on the river). There was a row of about 10 trailers along the river and to get down to them you had to go down a steep hill from the main road and it branched off in two different directions at the bottom.. My friend and I were walking to the porta potties at about 3 in the morning and a semi started coming down the hill, which was weird in the first place, and turned towards us at the fork with its headlights blinding us. We turned to get out of the way and walk towards the porta potties since we were near them and it was just gone all of a sudden. Went from a whole semi truck blinding us heading our way to nothing there in a matter of 2 seconds. It was kinda neat. Ghost cars aren't as scary as many other things :)"

We were outside a military base in traffic and many orange orbs appeared in the woods beside our car and even above the car, several cars ahead. Had to be at least thirty orbs. They appeared and then faded out of sight. I know for a fact that my aunt (she was driving the car) saw them. I think my brother and sister were asleep. However, I've never brought this instance up around my aunt. It just feels wrong. I'm kind of afraid she doesn't remember. Maybe I want to believe this never happened. I can't help but want to rationalize it, like why didn't the many cars around us honk their horns? It was seriously unlike anything I'd ever seen.

After a few mintues, they all turned and looked at me. ""It wants to talk to you"" they said. Absolutley not. I left the room.  After that night our apartment was not the same. That stupid light would turn off and on. We would leave the house with all lights out and return with it shining bright. I told myself that power surges made it come on. After I moved home I never had another issue with that lamp.  I always thought something was watching me. I couldn't sleep. On Halloween, my friends and I went to see the Rocky Horror Picture Show. I came out to the parking lot around 3:00 am to my brake light on my car shining in the dark. Somehow a part on the car that controlled the brake light malfunctioned. Crazy or not, I took that as a sign and tossed the board into the garbage bin.  I have not touched nor will I touch another board. I now feel it's best not to contact the unknown."
Thetruthishere,3bcd66,OuttaSightVegemite,5,Thu Jul 2 20:34:21 2015 UTC,"I believe you.  My mom and her best friend had an experience with a Ouija board when they were teenagers that she refuses to detail to this day.  Suffice to say it scared the living shit out of both of them and my mom went hardcore anti occult-based anything.  The fact that I became obsessed with ghosts and paranormal phenomenon from when I could first read freaked her out, and I had to sneak in books on the subject and hide them from her.  She still doesn't let me bring it up ever."
Thetruthishere,3bcd66,alecz127,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:28:27 2015 UTC,You need a priest or a witch who knows what they're doing to clear the house and get rid of that thing.  No one has anything good to say about the Hat Man.

Floor and ceiling? Equal measures loud in all directions? Was it a familiar tune? Or something more unique? Did you look all around the room? Was it crisp? are you certain the sound didn't travel through a dense medium like a wall? It came from inside the room for sure? Did the sound seem closer to your ears or the walls?"

By that I mean you are sensitive to spirits and you have the ability to perceive them. Some people are born that way, I believe. So, when you are a sensitive, spirits can tell - this makes you into a beacon. They are attracted to you. They like to be around you because you are aware of them and they get acknowledged when communicating to you in whatever way.  My husband is a bit of a sensitive. I am completely NOT, so it's fascinating when people are. I am glad you're not scared. You also seem to be respectful of the spirits so that's good too:)  I can't offer any insight on why they suddenly bail. But I believe some spirits are just wanderers and travelers."

It's snout was a bit bigger proportionately, like it falls somewhere between this and a hammer nose bat.   The rest of its body reminds me of the monster off of pumpkin head: http://www.wallpaperup.com/uploads/wallpapers/2014/03/04/286069/af84e30190ec9c591155abe5da96c16d.jpg  The skin color is very similar, and it had the same general skinny but muscular body. What it did not have are all those bony features on its chest, elbows, neck, and shoulders neither did it have the sunk in stomach. It's anatomy looked less exaggerated than this and more functional/real. And of the course the head/face looks nothing like it."

Thetruthishere,3azs7s,sherrybaby82,6,Wed Jun 24 20:59:00 2015 UTC,Why did you think demon and not alien? Or any other creature? Have you tried to look up which demon?
Thetruthishere,3azs7s,MasterChief1172,3,Thu Jun 25 14:34:26 2015 UTC,"I guess I call it a demon because it closer fits what people may imagine a demon to look like versus an alien. I'm not committed to it having to be a demon. That's just where my mind went to to describe it, because it was nothing like anything I've seen, but it had some beastly and unpleasant features to it. I do avoid calling it a ghost or spirit though, because it was clearly tangible and not a shadow or translucent figure.   Honestly, I'd rather not think it was a demon because it makes the creature itself more frightening and brings the implication that demons are real which is frightening.   I have looked at some demon stuff casually, but nothing fits what I saw, and believe most of it is made up by folks who did not see any of them themselves.  I always keep and eye out on demon stories from people claiming to have witnessed one first hand though, in hope that someone else has seen the same thing. Some have been similar, but so far I haven't found any exactly the same which helps me cope with it being a sleepwalk episode or vivid hallucination."

I hope what I saw was not real and a result of some sleepwalking episode or hallucination, but it absolutely was terrifying and left me messed up for a very long time."
Thetruthishere,3azs7s,Sorrowinsanity,4,Thu Jun 25 18:39:03 2015 UTC,"Sometimes healthy people have random hallucinations, so it's possible this was just a hallucination. And to try to help your frame of mind, just think: even if this creature was indeed real, so what? If you had to confront it, you could have scared it away, or fought it off. There were others around you to help. I have yet to hear of a person being physically injured because of an unknown creature or demon. Keep in mind that likely nothing would have happened had you confronted it. It would have ran away. Try to visualize a positive outcome to the situation. Imagine yourself confronting it and scaring it away."
Thetruthishere,3azs7s,masterhumus,3,Thu Jun 25 17:09:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are right. Thank you for that. These are the sort of things that have helped me move past it, that and a lot of time."
Thetruthishere,3azhn6,twobitdandy,3,Wed Jun 24 19:19:24 2015 UTC,"What sort of crystals did you buy?  Black tourmaline, moonstone, sodalite ...?  Were they tumbled or raw?  Where did you buy them, an actual shop or the internet?  If a shop, what sort of shop was it?  An alternative therapies shop, a wiccan store, a head shop?  To answer the question you posed at the end, yes, crystals can hold on to energy and should actually be regularly cleansed.  You can sage them as suggested below, or immerse them in sand or water (be careful with water; some crystals, like raw malechite, shouldn't be immersed in water because of adverse chemical reactions).  Cleansing should help clear out any negative energy attached to the stones and help them vibrate properly so they can do their jobs.  Regarding your nightmare, it's entirely possible it's a coincidence.  Your sleep was off-schedule, you bumped in to your mom who told you she was watching ghost shows, and you've recently delved in to the metaphysical.  All of this was brewing in your subconscious, and could have easily come out as a nightmare generated by a disruption in your usual sleeping patterns."
Thetruthishere,3azhn6,Intempestivity,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:22:15 2015 UTC,"IIIiii do not have the list, unfortunately, that would have stirred my memory to name the stones but I can provide a photo, if you desire.  We bought the stones at a metaphysical store that isn't specific about wiccan-ness or anything like that, just miscellaneous metaphysical stuff (books, crystals/stones, tarot cards, cds, etc).  I actually have cedar sage (I'm a pacific nw native) and white sage,  and I'm remembering the advice from the girl at the shop. She was more into geology than the metaphysical context of crystals but was nice enough to tell us about those purification rituals and that certain stones' can dissolve in water and what to do with them.  The nightmare may have been a coincidence, you're right, but I'll only keep it in mind (no pun intended) for a bit longer. I have heard some strange sounds tonight -- could be apartment settling, but it was that kind of 'movement' thing. Where the sounds happen in different places, as if it was something moving. This time its happening in the living room/kitchen area. Stones are still here in the living room.  I will let them stay longer in the living room, just to test it a little more, but then probably do some sage burning tomorrow regardless."
Thetruthishere,3azhn6,Intempestivity,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:23:30 2015 UTC,"If you wouldn't mind posting a picture, I can try to help identify them.  Some crystals don't do anything for protection and in fact will help you tune in to the other side more; others will protect against negative energies and entities, but let the good ones stay around, others will have naff all to do with the spiritual realm but are really good for disorders of the body and mind ... when buying crystals, it's important to know what exactly you want them for and what exactly you're buying."
Thetruthishere,3azhn6,Intempestivity,2,Sun Jun 28 07:19:07 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/wTYuVjj.png  I remembered all the names, but the blue one I wasn't sure. I recall that my mother thought she bought a blue onyx but found out that isn't it, So, now I'm kind of confused. It's just that color, no discernible striations or anything like that. I can't seem to find a match on crystal sites."
Thetruthishere,3azhn6,Tampwnisher,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:50:47 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking the blue might be Kyanite.  All of those stones are pretty good for general protection from negativity, especially Kyanite.  So if there is something supernatural skittering about your house, then chances are it's not negative, and it's not being aggravated by the crystals.  I'd really suggest cleaning the crystals, as a couple of them (particularly the agate) are really good receptacles for negative energy--they pull it out of the air and hold on to it, so cleansing them is particularly important to dispel anything they might have picked up along the way.  If you don't like the idea of spirits hanging around at all, whether or not they're benign, I'd suggest smoky amethyst and smoky quartz be added to the collection, as these are good crystals for helping lost souls move in to the light.  I'd cleanse all of the crystals and place them in the area that has the most disturbances, and it should clear out the spiritual energy for you.  Of course, if the disturbances are being generated by lizards, there's not much the crystals can do :)."
Thetruthishere,3azhn6,Intempestivity,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:21:08 2015 UTC,"Are people attracted to crystals for a reason? I noticed that when I go into stores that sell crystals or when I look online, I always end up being drawn to the amethyst. Something about it is just so appealing to me, even it's name. I never tried crystals before but have been curious."
Thetruthishere,3azhn6,Tampwnisher,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:11:15 2015 UTC,"I believe that yes, they are.  I personally can feel energies really well, and not just from crystals, from people, too.  There have been times when I've been drawn to a crystal and I had no idea why, and after learning what it does, it turns out it was exactly what I needed.  Amethyst is a lovely stone that promotes balance all around.  It's particularly helpful in balancing out emotions and people who have had severe insomnia report that sleeping with a piece of amethyst under their pillow helps them achieve a deeper, more restful sleep.  It is also good for helping people to focus more, and it gently stimulates the opening of doors between worlds, which in conjuction with the balancing of emotions and heightened focus, allows people to meditate more deeply.  It is also supposed to have an healing effect on addictive behaviours, attributed to its balancing nature, and historically was used to help drunks stay sober.  I don't know if any of this sounds like what you need in your life at the moment, but if you feel strongly attracted to it, I would suggest going in to a crystal shop and finding one that you feel connected to.  It will probably help you."
Thetruthishere,3azhn6,Intempestivity,2,Sun Jun 28 07:29:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, this actually really creeped me out.. but in a good way! haha! I guess you would say I am unbalanced. I try to focus my energy on  improving my life and improving my connection to the universe/ the other side but sometimes my emotions get the best of me. Which makes it hard to focus and stay positive. I do get insomnia every once in a while. I come from a family of addicts and while I never had a problem with anything i just find that strange how it is used to help addictive personalities. Are there any reputable websites I can order them from? Do you need more than one of the same crystal and how can you clean their energies?"
Thetruthishere,3azhn6,Tampwnisher,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:40:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know of any reputable websites other than the one for the shop I use (www.kellyscrystalshop.co.uk), but they're in the UK and I'm not sure where you're located.  I trust her website because I know her personally and I know her shop; her crystals are clean of any attachments or negative energy.  I'm wary of buying crystals from any place where I don't know the person or the shop they were stored in, because you never know what the crystals may have absorbed.  It's why I prefer to buy in person, and if there's any shops near you, I'd suggest that over the internet.  You don't need more than one of the same crystal unless you are trying to protect a whole home or other large area.  There are several ways of cleansing crystal energies--the two most common are immersing them in sage smoke or immersing them in sand.  Once cleansed, you can recharge their energies by setting them out in direct sunlight or a full moon's light for a few hours.  I personally like to clean them and recharge them once a month on average.  You also don't necessarily need to work directly with the crystal; they will release their energy in to the local area regardless.  If you are trying to change the atmosphere of a room, leave it in that room.  If you are using it to help yourself emotionally/physically, keep it on you as much as possible (I used to carry a small bag of crystals in my purse when I was having a difficult time at work).  However, placing the crystal on your person when mediatating will pull the crystal's energies in to your own--this is helpful if you're focussing on any sort of healing, be it emotional or physical, or if you are trying to connect to the spiritual realm.  I would clean crystals used in meditation or otherwise worked with more frequently than ones left in a room or carried around with you."

I live in California so it looks like she does ship her crystals out here.. Even reading the description of what this crystal does gives me this weird feeling, like as if I am.. craving it? Hmm anyways I'll do some more research and see if there are any shops nearby, they got rid of the last one in my town but they could of had bad crystals anyways. Wish me luck!

Thetruthishere,3azhn6,Tampwnisher,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:25:29 2015 UTC,Yes :)  They actually sell necklaces and bracelets with empty spirals that you can slot tumbled stones in to.
Thetruthishere,3azhn6,alecz127,2,Sun Jun 28 08:28:35 2015 UTC,oh awesome! I was asking because I saw that on the website you gave me that she sells jewelry too :)
Thetruthishere,3azhn6,blacklabelprodigy,2,Sun Jun 28 08:33:33 2015 UTC,"If you think it's the stones, that's very easy to fix. Burn some white sage and hold any objects that might have harmful energies in the smoke. Put belief into it working, it's like mind over matter. Burning smoke in the house will clear it as well and any people that roll the smoke over themselves. You can probably find bundles of white sage in the same stone shops."

My mom also had a dream of when our dog passed away about 4 months ago, she said in the dream she saw our dog berger walking down the hallway with my father..and she said in the dream he told her ""it's ok mommy you have to let go of her and be happy""..after a minute or so she said he also said ""come on berger let's go""...weird dream, I think she might have communicated with him? he loved berger very much so maybe they are together now? i am agnostic so I am not sure what to believe or what exists past death, which is why im in this section of reddit trying to find out lol.

Quite often there are other signs of communication you're missing entirely, simply because we're trained not to see those things anymore.  Someone is trying to tell you something, to get your attention for some reason.  React as though there is a person there and find out what they want.  You may find some ability you didn't know you have, like automatic writing or clairaudience or some such.  You have to open yourself to these things.

If you suspect it to be one of your grandparents (and you obviously do), why would you be afraid of finding out what they want to communicate to you?  What's dangerous is fear.  If you're sitting there afraid of stuff that you have no reason to be afraid of (now think about that before you comment), then you're opening yourself to all sorts of no good.  If you approach things with love and curiosity, it acts as a shield against those not-so-good things.    I am of course working from the assumption that your grandparents were benevolent people.  If they were twisted and evil, you might be right to avoid further contact.  However, be ready for any and all malevolence to find its way to you.  You will never outrun evil.  But you can beat it at its own game.  Remember:  Love conquers all.  That's not just some trite comment.  Once you understand what love really is, you will understand the truth in that statement."

A few thoughts now having watched it all and having eaten a bit of crow: It's definitely weird. For having it zoomed in so far, you keep an incredibly steady hand so well done (I look like I have something wrong with me when I zoom, everything shakes like crazy). Interesting to me is when, at around 1:05 it seems to speed up over your head. Maybe it's a drone.  Doesn't have to be military.  Definitely did not seem to move like a balloon though."

Thetruthishere,3aff72,I_am_the_bunny,3,Mon Jun 22 00:17:04 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd recommend something more along the lines of cleansing with sage.  Its not about the specific religion, if it were it would be extremely hard to pinpoint which particular faith the entity responded to. Its more about taking an action that it can't ignore of you saying you don't want it here.  The rituals just help you feel safer and like its more ""real"" like an exorcism, leaving you less vulnerable to retaliation."

The response is not always good though; I have heard plenty of stories of people either half assing it, The entity simply was to strong or did not care  and  the actions simply made it angry.  Could be that there are gods, Could be that  There's  not. What does seem to be a constant in all these situations Is Belief Either Held by the victim or someone Brought Into Help. Could be that the ""Power"" is directly proportional to how much someone ""believes"" And that may be why when the victim tries it it does not work. But when someone with a strong belief in it such as a catholic Priest or A Wiccan or occultist can drive it out."

It's very hard to tell if it's gods that are simply uncaring to the plights of most, Or if it's more of a ""Clap your hands if you believe"" Type of thing and based purely off either willpower or how much one cares for said potential deities."
Thetruthishere,3aff72,Sorrowinsanity,2,Thu Jun 25 21:23:29 2015 UTC,"I have actually given some thought to this. I think it boils down to belief. The words or language you use is not important, but the meaning and will behind them is what really matters.   Think of it as conviction. If someone tells you something, but without conviction then you don't believe them, but if they speak with conviction then you atleast believe that they believe it.   The Belgariad Series is a fantasy novel series that approaches this concept. It's called the Will and the Word."

To confirm my suspicions i would bring a dog over to the house and have it sniff it out and explore. If the dog gets frightened then move on the next step. Why dogs? I believe animals and children can see things adults cant. Ive read and heard numerous occasions where animals can sense spiritual entities.   Next, have a priest come and purge the house and bless it. See if that helps. Or look into a paranormal expert to come and check out the house.   Either way if it was my kid or nephew i run out of there."
Thetruthishere,3aff72,edelysa,2,Fri Jun 19 23:23:03 2015 UTC,I too would get the house blessed. You can try first yourself with sage. I mean unless you are afraid then I would also call someone.

A few days later the bathroom sink turned itself on and we could not turn it off... had to take out an alum wrench and manually adjust it to stop the water.  I worked for the university and had to report in very early some days, 6am.  Usually I would cut across mirror lake.  One day I was crossing over and noticed some lighs reflecting off the water so I looked up: two pulsating orbs in the sky (UFOs) and they freaked me the F out.  One appeared to be zooming in and out while the other sat complacent next to it.  After zooming in and out a few times it just vanished; and immediately after the other shot off at warp speed.

When I was a kid, my dad was a fan or Erich von Daniken, so I grew up on a diet of UFO stories and the occasional boring MUFON meetings.  (Pro-tip: never drag an imaginative kid to meetings.  ALL meetings of grown-ups are boring.  That's as true, if not truer now than when I was a kid.)

Then I started working alongside ""psychics"" who were out and out frauds and it pushed me away a bit.  I've seen and experienced things I can't explain - what appeared to be conventional, semi transparent ghosts; solid, physically present creatures in the shapes of people they couldn't be; sounds and lights in the sky...  Mostly, my beliefs these days hang on one thing: we're not as clever as we think we are and we don't know as much about the universe as we think we do. Perhaps we're not mature enough as a species for things to become apparent or perhaps we've led ourselves down the wrong path and will need to start our concept of science almost from scratch before things will make sense... Or perhaps we just haven't unlocked enough of the facts of the universe, yet.  Either way, like much of what was considered magic in the past, eventually, I think a lot of this will be explained by science. Not just by ""sleep paralysis"" or ""infra sound"" that pushes the notion that the experiences are hallucinations, but that they are truly rooted in something, we just didn't understand it until that point.  What seems weird and spooky now, will turn out to be another her facet of a completely mundane and necessary but fascinating universe, like dark matter and bioluminescence."

I could believe there are strange lights in the sky, but alien abduction scenarios just seem made up to me. It didn't help that I researched it for a while, and it seemed to come from people with an overactive imagination. Often it was conflating dreams with experiences, literally - ""I dreamed this so I think they've been abducting me.""

We're talking several minutes here. Seems weird to me.   For the most part though, UFO stuff seems really far fetched in regards to a lot of the alien stuff that people claim.

Thetruthishere,3afbph,BlackSheepHere,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:53:50 2015 UTC,"Ball lightning:       Ball lightning is an unexplained atmospheric electrical phenomenon. The term refers to reports of luminous, spherical objects which vary in diameter from pea-sized to several meters. It is usually associated with thunderstorms, but lasts considerably longer than the split-second flash of a lightning bolt. Many early reports say that the ball eventually explodes, sometimes with fatal consequences, leaving behind the odor of sulfur.    Until the 1960s, most scientists argued that ball lightning was not a real phenomenon but an urban myth, despite numerous reports throughout the world.  Laboratory experiments can produce effects that are visually similar to reports of ball lightning, but whether these are related to the natural phenomenon remains unclear.  Many scientific hypotheses about ball lightning have been proposed over the centuries. Scientific data on natural ball lightning are scarce, owing to its infrequency and unpredictability. The presumption of its existence is based on reported public sightings, and has therefore produced somewhat inconsistent findings. Given inconsistencies and lack of reliable data, the true nature of ball lightning is still unknown.  The first ever optical spectrum of what appears to have been a ball lightning event was published in January 2014 and included a video at high frame rate.

I totally believe in cryptids like Nessie/Champ and other water based creatures. I think there is still so much undiscovered in the water that it is totally possible a small population of something supposedly extinct or a missing link is still surviving. I sort of Want to Believe in Bigfoot and other cryptids but I find that less likely than aquatic creatures. I want to believe in ghosts and life after death based on some experiences but i am logical enough to know that my desire for it to be true clouds my judgement.

Thetruthishere,3afbph,MasterBulldog,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:31:08 2015 UTC,"I think Big Foot is the hardest for me to believe simply because there's been so much stuff now on 'finding Bigfoot' and we still have 0 conclusive evidence, just seems like they're chasing the ghost of an idea now.   I think there definitely are instances of big animals that we're typically more unfamiliar with catching people by surprise. The woods of Canada, for example, are just so fucking huge, whats to say we don't quite know all the species if there's some sort of obscure critter running about? Chances are pretty much zero on this being a possibility, but I always want to keep my mind open to these things. In my area of Manitoba, I've heard twice now of a grey 'animal' that is apparently either like a bear or a big timberwolf but is just 'off' by that little degree that makes people uncertain as to what it is. Incidents were separated by 60 years though, so it doesn't really mean that much. Fear of the unknown tends to make these 'mysterious' animals bigger than they have to be, but a small part of me wants to believe dammit!   But being that this is a hunting community, if there was something strange and noteworthy out there, we'd probably know by now. Hell, the government introduced cougars to our area a few years ago and never officially acknowledged it for two years until someone had sense to take a picture of two of them eating an elk they had fallen. If even elusive cougars could have been found, the little grey thing my buddy thinks he saw would have been found. Probably just a big wolf."
Thetruthishere,3afbph,blacklabelprodigy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:44:56 2015 UTC,"Ironically, even though I seem to encounter more than my fair share of ghosts, I often say I don't really believe in ghosts. I believe in... something, that's for sure. I've seen/felt/heard too many strange, unexplained things not to. But are the things I've seen/heard/felt actually the souls of dead people?  I wasn't raised Christian, but I converted when I was younger, and I still believe in much of what I learned, if not all of it. The God I believe in isn't hateful and cruel, so I have a hard time reconciling the apparitions people see, the activities they experience, with the idea that God (or Whomever) would just kind of... leave people here. Especially since many of them wouldn't seem to ""deserve"" it as some kind of punishment for evil deeds. So what do I believe in? I don't know. I don't necessarily think there are dead peoples' souls walking around us, but I think maybe the theory that energy can't be destroyed, and therefore some part of a person remains, is pretty valid. Heck, I think sometimes a person's energy can remain even if they're not dead yet. So I guess I believe in energy, as lame and new-agey as that sounds.  I suppose I also believe in non-human entities, too. Like demons and angels, or call them what you will. Good and bad and neutral spirits. Similarly, I don't discount the stories of ""monsters"" and other folklore creatures. I don't know if they're physical cryptids, but they sure do seem to be something.  One thing I don't put any stock in is aliens. I think UFOs are probably man-made, just tech we haven't been made privy to yet. Those that aren't hoaxes and mis-identifications, that is... I would probably explain abductions with sleep paralysis, dreams, and ""hypno-therapists"" preying on people. I've heard some abductions leave behind physical evidence... I don't know, possibly repressed memories from something that DID happen? I've also heard the theory that ""aliens"" are actually faeries or other spirit beings... don't know how I feel about that one, pretty iffy on it. I just feel like it doesn't make any sense for aliens to come to our planet, but despite having vast technological advances and a desire to either help us ascend or invade us, they haven't made their presence known whatsoever. For over two hundred years.  I don't believe in Big Foot, either. Definitely not as a physical entity. If it exists, it's some kind of spirit/energy/whatever. Same goes for most urban legend monsters. I definitely don't want to say that they're all hoaxes, though I'd wager a grand majority are, but a lot of it is probably mis-identification or hallucination or whatever. The few that are true... Man, I don't know. I like to put stock in the spirit theory, but sometimes... You gotta wonder. I guess I should say that I'm open to the idea of them existing in some physical capacity, but I think it's highly unlikely.  And now for something slightly embarrassing: I sort of believe in magic. Not the hokey Satan-worship stuff, but I believe that people can influence the world through force of will, tapping into energy, or working with spirits. It doesn't work 99.9% of the time, but I think in some rare cases, it can.  And now for something SUPER embarrassing: I sort of almost believe in werewolves. There are just some really uncanny stories, you know? Some of them took place near where I live, and those people, I have a hard time believing they'd just make stuff up like that. And part of me knows for sure it's a hoax, or a lie, but another part of me isn't so sure. Yeah, that's pretty dumb, I know. I don't believe in aliens, but I believe in man-wolves? Stupid. I'm sure they're fake, but I guess it's hard to convince myself completely. They spook me a little."

This seems to happen most often as I am laying in bed trying to sleep, and my first response is to mentally fill the room with white light, which is basically emanating from you. What you are doing is bringing light and love into your space which no negative thing can remain in. Try doing this every night for a week along with the cleansing/saging, and my bet is you'll notice a difference. Keep us posted..."

Thetruthishere,3acfpx,drunkhooker,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:22:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, sweetgrass isn't such a good idea. Just stick with white sage, which is especially helpful if you sweep your floor all the way to the nearest exit and sweep all the dirt & stuff well out of the house-like out the front door and down the stairs or a few paces down the walk-don't just sweep it out onto your porch and leave it there. Burning the white sage attracts energies, sweeping (symbolically?) gathers things together and literally cleans and rids an area of dirt and dust. When you burn sage and then thoroughly sweep the area you burned sage in, continue sweeping in a path to the nearest exit, and sweep the dirt and stuff you've swept up all the way to the outside of the structure, the energies gathered by burning the white sage follow you and go outside too.  Sweetgrass also attracts energies, but it is not the same thing as white sage. It's more powerful and shouldn't be used as casully as white sage."
Thetruthishere,3acfpx,LibertyUnderpants,10,Fri Jun 26 10:37:48 2015 UTC,"Firstly, know there is nothing to be afraid of. If you feel freaked out, know that you are a rock and ""spirits"" or whatever they might be are the waves. They cannot harm you, even at their most potent. If you can control your fears, you can do what I do in ""haunted"" spaces and subconsciously (or loudly if you feel brave) invite whatever is present to try its best to prove itself anything but inconsequential and practically nonexistent. Assuming the energies people seem to detect as ghosts are lucid and sentient, whatever it is will either back off or make itself more known. Odds are very good it will be the first thing, because the second one has not been known to happen.  I know some disagree with my stance on these things and believe spirits/demons/etc are something to be reckoned with, but I see them at best as personifications of various aspects of the human condition that have existed a long time in our social consciousness, which are then projected onto occurrences in nature we didn't or don't understand, and at worst as after-shadows of energies long dissipated. And finally, if people truly have a psychic influence on their environment, confidence is at least as important as good intentions. You are not the hunted, but the hunter. You are benign yet powerful. YOU are the spiritual force to be reckoned with, not some frightened prey or easy target. You fill your space and cannot be made lesser by some weak-ass presence."

My old cat used to do same fucking thing.  I'd always get freaked out and open the door and there would be nothing there. Till I installed a camera outside my bedroom door.  The little shit would come up to the door, stand on its hind legs and bat at the door knob with both paws and take off as soon as it heard me move or stand up.   God knows why they do this, they see us using the doorknobs probably and think its a magical door opening button. It's lonely or cold out there at night and want's to come inside.  Or maybe its just a little shit.   Can't explain the rest but the door rattle is the cat.

I would hear weird noises form the attic as I was falling asleep, and ironically my cat acted the same way as Harry a few times but with bonus 'staring at an open space on the floor fixatedly' aspect that made it terrifying.   What worked for me was setting up an iPod (this was a while ago, lol, but an iPhone on a charger could work) on a speaker/boombox in my room (think an iHome or something) and having it on something like Dean Martin music (something calming and low key) on repeat all night, just loud enough to cover up weird noises mostly but also quiet enough not to keep me awake. Nowadays (in a different house) I have a standing fan loud enough to drown out any noise so I can't even get myself riled up.  As for the clock thing, I had that too but I believe it was 3:17. It stopped once I moved out of the creepy room. Maybe turn your clock so you can't see the numbers easily from the bed? It could be mental reinforcement along with general unease in the room.

Thetruthishere,3a2v11,SpicyPeaSoup,5,Tue Jun 16 21:28:13 2015 UTC,"Have you read the book Communion by Whitley Strieber? You might want to. He describes a similar incident in the book where he is able to clearly see an eidetic image of the alien when he closes his eyes.  *Edit – Found a PDF of the book online. This is the part where he describes it:  ""The Image  The morning after the hypnotic session covering my experience with the fogbank (March 11, 1986) I awoke not only feeling as if I had been beaten up during the night, I was aware of something new in my mind.  At first the exact nature of this new manifestation was not clear to me. I was oppressed by it; there was an acute impression of being watched. Then I began to realize why: I was being watched — there was a face staring directly at me, the grave, implacable, subtly humorous face I had come to recognize from hypnosis.  A vivid image of her had emerged in my mind. It was so real I could almost touch it. This was disturbing and I was eager to expel it, assuming it to be a side effect of the hypnotic session, occurring because Dr. Klein had asked for so many details about her appearance. It was so extraordinarily clear. I was in a panic. I couldn't live with this image perpetually reminding me of the visitors' enigmatic presence in my life.  I went into my office and sat on the floor, going deed into a state of meditation. I drew my concentration to my body, directing my attention to my physical center of gravity just below the navel, and away from my racing mind.  It took only a moment for me to see that the image had not gone away. On the contrary, it had be come far more clear. It wasn't anything like any other imagistic material I had ever had in my mind. I could not calm myself. I was frantic. For the first few hours it was static, simply staring back at me with those large, glistening eyes.  I have never had eidetic, or photographic, memory, so this image was something very new for me. An eidetic image is very much like a photograph inside the mind. This one, though, was far more than a photograph. It had the urgency of life about it. Despite my attempts to explain it to Budd Hopkins and Don Klein, I could not succeed in communicating to others just how special it seemed to me to be. Nor did I really know this  myself until a few days later, when some of the remarkable properties of the image were revealed.  I think that the image was somehow triggered by hypnosis. Maybe the intense state of concentration evoked it from my unconscious . . . or maybe I attracted the visitors' attention and they responded.  After the image appeared I did research into eidetic memory and found that it is very rare in adults, almost to the point of being nonexistent in Western cultures. What's more, the descriptions I found of eidetic images did not even begin to correspond to what I was experiencing. People did not report that their eidetic images had a life of their own. This one seemed ready to reach out and touch me. I felt a strong sense of relationship. Looking at it was more like looking at a person behind soundproof glass than looking at a picture.  I found that the image not only moved about of its own accord, it would move on command. It showed me its hands, its face, every detail of its body. Anne asked me to describe its feet and it leaned forward against something that I could not see and raised a foot, which appeared almost like a very simple version of a human foot. Instead of toes there was a solid structure split in only one place. Like all the joints, the ankle appeared simple in structure.  While I might indeed have been viewing the result of some extraordinary connection between myself and a real, conscious being, it may also be that this was an act of the imagination — the act of a mind calling upon itself to provide another argument in favor of this being an experience with an external component."""

Nothing in my mind has ever been so vivid."

Thetruthishere,3a2v11,NorthBlizzard,2,Wed Jun 17 10:48:33 2015 UTC,"A possibility is you have been abducted and they wipe your memory.  Considering it happened to your mother, and you have her DNA, and they only mess with people with certain DNA, it's probable. Two steps you can take are getting hypnosis regression to blocked memories, and the other step is to tell them they don't have your consent to influence your life or bother you, which, if they've abducted you, they've gotten you to give beforehand. These beings historically have an obsession with our DNA, and will go to such lengths to produce specific combinations of it that they will manipulate individuals from birth to love eachother so as to produce the fetus they need, destroying marriages and lives. They also get some sort of boner creating emotional turmoil. They are malicious.  These greys are not aliens, that's what they like people to think because they can take advantage of us better when they're viewed as powerful. Any real researcher who's been in this feel for more than 5 years can't accept the alien theory anymore. They're inter-dimensional, and their base of operations is likely underground. From that location, they interfere with us psychically/on a different plane, as they seem averse to actually being on the planet's surface. A simple but inaccurate way to categorize them would be as demons considering their connection to emotional pain and vice and sightings of them underground.   Take from that as you will, it's the truth I've come to understand."
Thetruthishere,3a1sxq,scotchdog,3,Tue Jun 16 15:48:22 2015 UTC,"It is somewhat. I guess I don't take my primordial senses very seriously. I mean fear is just a scapegoat for not being able to comprehend. Something moving on its own. A loud sudden noise. A freakish entity stalking you, in my case. It's just a scapegoat of the mind which tries to initiate a fight or flight reaction.  But if you think about it ""a scary hideous entity walking toward you"",  I mean what purpose does it have to serve? It only exists to scare you. It has one purpose. Come on, that's kind of... well hilarious. If only I were capable of bursting into laughter at my hallucinations in the moment I would be able to overcome fear all together. I guess I would make a very crazy schizophrenic. The laughing madhouse kind.   In contrast I think another truth is that all anger, in a similar regard, stems from an inability to understand. Its easy to annoy people just by adding processes to complete basic tasks, or doing basic tasks ineffectively, like sitting rubbish on the lip of a garbage bin, or taking a long time to say something so incredibly simple ;D.  I would go as far to even say that's why people hate pedophiles. We cannot understand how these people have no empathy for their victims, the physical and life long psychological trauma it causes. To abuse a position of trust to harm someone innocent for their own gratification. Wheres the empathy? Its on par with watching someone harm an animal and get pleasure from doing so. Its so impossible to understand. So anger and hatred... I see it as an inability to understand, both rightfully and ignorantly so.  TLDR; I have little respect for my biological programming."

I wonder if I could physically feel the hallucination like how people feel phantom limbs or phantom sensations.   I'll have to do it again at some stage I guess. If only I knew how to hallucinate good things.
Thetruthishere,3a1sxq,SushiAndWoW,4,Tue Jun 16 16:53:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know if its physically possible to go from feeling dread and fear to love and acceptance that quickly.   Probably not.

Thetruthishere,3a1m9m,SailorSpaghetti,6,Tue Jun 16 15:37:01 2015 UTC,"I'm going to take the stance that you most likely just grew and changed, and nobody drained you of your energy / powers.  I've never experienced interactions with people like you have, and I've never personally witnessed a paranormal phenomenon (I don't think), but during my teen years, I used to be soooo creative and passionate about certain things that I could barely contain myself.  I wrote and drew obsessively, to the point where I would wake up at 4am to write a little before going to school, or turn down invites from friends to work on projects.  I went through a period of depression at the end of high school, and I used to lament that I had lost some of myself during that time because I pretty much haven't written or drawn in a dedicated fashion since.  While I do think my depressive period changed me, I now believe that I mostly just changed as all people do over time.  I just stopped enjoying some of my previous hobbies, and that was OK.  I was only driving myself crazy by trying to ""get back"" something I didn't even really like anymore.  My emotions were also a lot wilder back then, too...which is normal for teens.  I've chilled out A LOT, thankfully.  In your case, you went through a period of ""using substances"" and interacting with a lot of different people after having a conservative background.  I'm sure this affected and changed you in many ways.  My friend was a goth kid for a while, and I was a shy, artistic type.  We're aren't those things any longer.  They were persona born from our surroundings and developing senses of self.    Also, younger kids seem to categorically have more paranormal experiences and inclinations than adults.  There are so many people who say they experienced odd things back in the day, then never have since.  I think that's simply how our brains grow.  Honestly, I wouldn't give one person the credit for taking away a part of yourself.  I'm open-minded, but I think a person who would say crap like that just wants to feel important or is delusional.  You changed as a person for myriad reasons, and that's fine.  Don't let that seed of doubt he planted in you grow any further, because it doesn't deserve to."
Thetruthishere,3a1m9m,Candle_Jacqueline,2,Tue Jun 16 18:02:05 2015 UTC,"I think I might have some advice that may help you, but I can only really tell you what worked for me. It might not work for you, and I might be totally wrong. So here goes:  I’m pretty sure I’m an empath too. Not 100% sure, I’m kind of still on the fence about it, but my experiences have lined up with other empaths’ experiences as well, so it’s the best conclusion I can come to. We kind of had similar experiences when we were younger (minus all the psychic, supernatural stuff, that’s unique to you). I was called “too sensitive” all the time. I thought it was just how everyone was, they were just better at dealing with their emotions. It wasn’t until much later that I learned that most people didn’t pick up so easily on the emotions and states of other people, or even animals and fictional characters on TV and in movies. One thing I vividly remember from my childhood was that I couldn’t watch any of the sitcoms that were based on miscommunications and humorously stressful situations, because I got just as stressed as the characters in the show. That’s So Raven left me a nervous wreck (you can’t make that shit up).   My early adolescence was awful because I picked up on all the stress and emotions of my parents and the other people around me. I thought there was something genuinely wrong with me because of how hectic my emotions were. At this point, I still thought everyone felt things the same way I did, and that they were just good at dealing with them. It wasn’t until I started asking people about their feelings on things that I learned that most people weren’t like me--they didn’t feel sad when watching a sad movie, and they didn’t feel stressed or upset when people told him about their bad days. I think realizing that you experience and feel things differently is a big part of maturing and growing when you’re an empath. It’s certainly comforting too; you don’t have a mental illness, you’re not weak or thin-skinned, you’re just different.   I think it’s totally normal to have periods where you don’t feel as emotionally open or as easily affected. I’ve had a few times like that, when I was actively trying to be cold. It would typically take something to knock me out of it--getting inspired to write something, watching a certain movie, finishing a video game, things like that. I don’t think you’ve “lost” anything. I think you might be out of touch with it and you can get it back.   There’s a ton of reasons you might be out of touch with your empathy and they’re not necessarily something emotional. When I don’t take care of myself--like when my diet is shit, when I don’t get a lot of physical activity, or when just don’t feel like putting effort into anything--I find that it’s much harder to connect with others emotionally. Maybe it’s something to do with just having too little energy to spare. So if you’re in a situation like that, maybe try going out of your way to eat healthier (and by this I don’t mean eating in a way to lose weight, like a strict caloric deficit, just eat in a way that gives you what your body needs and excludes what it doesn’t)  and get some exercise (nothing extremely draining, unless you like to do that :) ). It’s not selfish to take care of yourself. Spring-boarding off of that, are you in a situation where you have to take care of other people or you don’t have a lot of time to yourself (i.e., are you a parent?) If you are, find a way to escape and recharge. If you’re completely depleted, even if you are an emotional empath, your body’s gonna choose to divert energy to whatever it prioritizes.  You mentioned you used to write and paint a lot. What inspired you before? Also, did having the free time to do it, that you might not have now, make it easier? If that’s the case, set aside a specific amount of time at a specific time of day to do it. You ever notice how easy it is to daydream in school and at work, but at home it’s like, poof, nothing? I think it’s because when we’re constrained in certain things like when we eat, when we wake up, where we sit, we exercise freedom in our minds to make up for lack of freedom in our physical surroundings. At home, when we have the freedom to choose what we want to do, we don’t have that same urge to wander off in our minds. Setting up a certain time each day might help give that structure and restriction that’s sometimes necessary for inspiration.   Again, this is all based on my own experiences and what helped me. It might be utter bullshit to everyone else, but one thing that helped me immensely was getting a pet. My own pet, not my parents’, not a friend’s, my own. I got a parakeet and I love him to death and just having him around has helped me in so many ways. For the empath specific benefits, having something to focus on and feel the energies of that’s positive and loving is really helpful whenever I’m around negative people.   And speaking of negative people, that guy that told you you’re giving your friend migraines is, in my own opinion, full of it. That doesn’t mean he is because I don’t know him, but from what I can tell he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Empaths can’t make other people feel shit, at least with just their empathy. Empaths pick up on what other people feel. We’re the sponge. It’s a passive ability, a sensory one. You can’t make people feel anything because of your sense of smell, why would you be able to make someone feel something because of your empathy? Besides, unless you live in close proximity or you talk very often at night with her, it’s unlikely you’d even be able to pick up on her emotions from a distance (unless you can do that, in which case please correct me). There’s a ton of reasons people get migraines. If it’s really from something metaphysical, I’d wager that he was the cause, if she only started getting them after being around him. I have met people I’d describe as “psychic vampires,” so it’s totally possible that’s what he is.   lol. “Turn off your empathy”? Your sense of touch is making me uncomfortable. I’m gonna turn it off unless you stop!1!  tl;dr -- you might totally be an empath, you haven’t lost it, and to get it back you can try getting yourself into a better place energy-wise and recreate the situations in which you felt inspiration and emotion when you were younger."
Thetruthishere,3a1m9m,Candle_Jacqueline,3,Tue Jun 16 17:21:51 2015 UTC,"LOL thank you for this reply! I always thought that dude was full of it too, but having a friend I really trust call him a ""psychic vampire"" gave me pause. You are right, I am not only a parent but also in the middle of many family members who all have a lot of issues and conflicts among each other that they dump all over me. I am always very depleted emotionally and mentally but I do eat very healthy and get regular exercise.  As far as what inspired me, well, it was just always there, all the time, feelings and thoughts that needed to get out on paper or canvas. I didn't have to look for it.   Thanks for sharing your experiences too. I totally relate to the feeling that something is wrong with you for feeling so strongly.  It's good to know that others went through the same.  I just really feel a sense of something I used to have being missing, but it sounds like the consensus is pretty much what I've already been leaning toward: I need to nurture it myself and rediscover whatever ability I once had.  Thank you!   ETA: stuff about empathy"

The flat was at the quiet end of the high street of a small town, with an open balcony running outside all the flats to get to each cluster of doors. My cousins and siblings were all playing on the balcony and all saw what we thought were space ships having a war. They were in the form of lots of multi coloured star-like lights moving around and sometimes seeming to collide with each other.   We lived close to Heathrow at the time, but it wasn't planes because those were different and even when I was little I knew what those looked like because we lived on the flight path and I used to spot them out of the window at night.   We tried to get our parents and the other adults to come out and look, but they just told us not to be silly kids.  I came here and read this ready to scoff, but what you describe is very close to what we saw."

The point of light that appeared to wobble around but stay in the same vicinity was just a star; I know eyes wiggle a bit when focusing on something.   OP - take note where in the sky and at what time your sighting took place. Look back in the same spot at the same time on another night. It's probably there. Try focusing on another star that doesn't have anything around it. I imagine you will see similar movements."

That only happened once though."
Thetruthishere,39yndc,dazegoby,0,Fri Jun 19 05:57:10 2015 UTC,"lol ANYONE READING THIS can do this experiment. It works better if you're on an opiate narcotic, which I would bet the FARM that OP is on, percocet or vicodin or even heroin.   Go out side at night. This only works well if you're not in a big city and you can see the stars well. pick the brightest star, tilt your head back and stare at it without blinking for as long as you can. (well what i mean is stare at it for about ten min, blinking as infrequently as possible). Now take your focus and dart it from just above the star to just below it and back, then do a circle around the star, and you will soon notice that the star looks like it is MOVING. Once you do this, then all you need to do is just stare at the star and you won't be able to get it to STOP moving. It looks as if the star is zigzagging , going on circles, moving slowly back and forth, and you will SWEAR that it is being intelligently controlled. Well it is, sorta. (then again intelligently is a bit of a stretch in this sub), by YOU! - it is an optical illusion and is very convincing. If you have never tried it, do it tonight and you will see why people are ALWAYS posting silly shit like this. ""I see the same alien ship in the same spot every night and it sits there for HOURS zigzagging and moving in circles and going back and forth!"" ITS A FUCKING STAR. If you still need convincing, which I know you will becuase you insist that a star is an alien ship, go inside the house and find the ""ship"" thru the window. Get 4 pieces of black electrical tape, and make a square so only the tiniest pinhole is poking thru. find the ""ship"" thru the pinhole, and prop your head up on the wall or your hands ah it doesn't move. find the star and now you'll see that it isn't moving AT ALL. The tape isn't moving, and now that you have a reference point LOOK! THE SHIP STOPPED TOO!   I hate to be a sarcastic dick about it, but this sub is FLOODED with people telling about their crazy intergalactic space battles that go on every night.   PS,  YES STARS CAN TWINKLE RED BLUE WHITE.  The light is traveling millions upon millions of miles before entering your retina. Dust gets in the way along the path from the star to your eye. this causes the twinkle. Different wavelengths of light show as different colors. So some dust might be rich in iron, or water from a comet, or rock and it filters out differnt waves. This causes the red white and blue you see....... it isn't an alien ship. it's a star. it isn't moving, your BRAIN is moving. PLEASE PLEASE stop posting your stories about how you see aliens every night. if you see a genuine UFO it is a one on a lifetime event. if you see it twice in the same spot in 2 days, chances are its a star. if you see it every day ITS A FUCKING STAR"
Thetruthishere,39yndc,Dibblerius,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:56:07 2015 UTC,"It is actually the atmosphere that causes stars to twinkle. Not dust on the way. They are small enough dots in the sky for atmospheric random refraction to have enough effect.   Planets are to big dots to get the same effect in the night sky, so you can spot them by that property.   Stars do not twinkle when viewed from space."

About the shadows: are you sure you weren't seeing animals or shadows from the trees and leaves moving? I grew up in the woods and the slightest unnoticeable breeze can do that. It would be pretty neat if you could determine that it was not caused by any of these things. :)  edited because I screwed up the formatting"

As for the shadows the woods there didn't have any animals and the shadows were darker than the shadows from the trees. They also moved in a fluid manner from tree to tree around us.

I tried again today and let the employee I talked to know the full story and he was much more helpful and didn't write me off as much as the first employee did. he said he ""ran the number through the system"" whatever that means and said that the number was still not registered to anyone new and had not been active in years."
Thetruthishere,39afu6,torreneastoria,7,Wed Jun 10 18:38:49 2015 UTC,"I used to work on the back end of AT&T. The people you talk to when you call for issues with your bill, phone problems, transferring accounts, that stuff. There is a way to look up phone numbers to check if they are active, or their last use date. All he did was type it into his main system. It would come up inactive on any account it was on, if that number was even on an account.   If he wanted to further look into it the rep could look and see when the last call placed was for that number was.  Now legally he could not give you that information on an active line. That has to do with you being able to verify that account, and personal privacy.  It would also show up on the bill details of that number. This can be accessed on the internet.   Cellphone number cloning is rare now but still can happen. It is possible that someone called from her number, but it was a cloned number. Usually these are scammers.   I'm personally a believer.

Ok, so my mom and friend JT are from one state and both end up moving to another same state. JT first, and mom follows. Ends up JT has not been doing well at all, she had had a rough life and was just done, so she also killed herself. : (  She left behind 2 kids and a husband. About a year goes by and mom goes back to first state for a visit and a ton of msgs show up on her phone because this is the state her cell phone service was created in and once she was in the origional range of cell company, they showed up.....and there it was, the last call JT had made to my mother explaining her sadness and her plans to kill herself....hoping my mom would come in time to save her, but they were sent from in a different state outside of range. Apparently the cell provider had these in their system but they could not be sent because now both women were in different range. This could be similar to what happened here. Except I do think it is weird that the calls came at the time they did around 3 am, which is known for spirit communication.   I am so sorry about your friend and you too. This is pretty heavy to have to bear for the rest of your life at such a young age.

For many years my mother hid this woman and her first child, in my brother and sisters closet to hide them from the childs father. He had been molesting the young girl for years. My mother helped her change her identity and the childs too and then took their lives into her hands. It all started with a secret phone call from a secret person who then planned their travels to my mothers state. The woman stayed on the run from the abuser for many years until the child turned 18 and could speak for herself. My mom truly was her only real friend in this life. Sad to see that the stresses of all this finally took its toll. So, really, thanks for your support. Life is not good for all of us.

Thetruthishere,39afu6,Radium_Coyote,7,Wed Jun 24 02:44:42 2015 UTC,"wow, i am so sorry for your mother's loss. sounds like she must have been a very special friend if your mom spoke about her so dearly.   things like this stick with you forever, i still feel numb when I truly think I can't see her and share all my happy moments with her like we did. but maybe it's things like this that are her way of reminding me she isn't gone.  I like to think that when our loved ones die, they never really go. they're the wind in the trees, the ripples in the water, the soil under our feet. your mom is a wonderful person and I hope she knows her friend is very much alive still in spirit, and it's thanks to her that her friend will always live on. sending you both my regards, and thank you for sharing your story with me."
Thetruthishere,39afu6,Senappi,9,Thu Jun 11 20:39:41 2015 UTC,"The logical part of me says: whoever inherited that number was calling you back to see what you wanted.  You've got a whole story attached to this, and it's very probably just some confused jerk in Cleveland who wants to know why you're calling him."
Thetruthishere,39afu6,rollerboogie,3,Wed Jun 10 14:10:19 2015 UTC,"just updated the original post with some new details, but I actually just contacted her phone provider and they said that the number has not yet been reassigned according to their records, nor has it been active since she died in April 2012. i'm so weirded out right now."
Thetruthishere,39afu6,Radium_Coyote,0,Wed Jun 10 18:49:31 2015 UTC,"OK, then... have you a PLAN of action?"
Thetruthishere,39afu6,IWasAMidgetHorse,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:23:34 2015 UTC,"yes, I believe i'm going to contact the current owner of kate's phone (her mom) and see if she knows if anyone has access to the phone and SIM card right now. at least that was what the phone company employee recommended I do, as he legally couldn't tell me if there were any calls made from her phone for privacy reasons."
Thetruthishere,39afu6,that-lol-chick,2,Thu Jun 11 04:02:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know how AT&T works, but where I am, if a number is disconnected, the related SIM won't be allowed to place any other calls than to the emergency number (and those calls you can place without a SIM in the phone).   This is one of the spookier things I've read in this subreddit ."
Thetruthishere,39afu6,BadAdviceBot,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:22:32 2015 UTC,"haha definitely one of the spookiest experiences of my life, so i'm glad I have you all along for the ride. all these comments and suggestions have been incredibly helpful.   that's interesting to know, I highly doubt it would be very different unless you are in a different country than I am (US)... so that might knock off the idea that someone reactivated her phone with the SIM card."
Thetruthishere,39afu6,deliriouswalker,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:25:37 2015 UTC,It still says the number is disconnected or whatever when you call it right?

Thetruthishere,39afu6,RealGsDontSleep,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:14:30 2015 UTC,"OK, lemme axe you a stupid question: What if she does NOT know that?  What do you seriously do if the phone company guy had what could be considered as bad advice."
Thetruthishere,39afu6,nietzsche_was_peachy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:38:12 2015 UTC,"i'm almost certain her mom has the phone or at the very least knows where it would be, as a few friends and I were invited over after Kate's funeral to take a reminder or a few of her from her room and spend time with her family. i helped her mom and sister pack a few more belongings into a box and i remember the cell phone being amongst kate's belongings that stayed with her at home."
Thetruthishere,39afu6,xpenvex,2,Thu Jun 11 20:17:47 2015 UTC,Agreed. The message she gets that says the voicemail box isn't set up yet is a default if people don't turn on and configure voicemail.  The number was probably reassigned.

I always knew that weird things tend to happen at night (both from personal experience and many years of watching horror films, haha) but never knew there was a certain hour associated with it. I think I saw that mentioned elsewhere in the comments too, so i'll definitely have to look into it.  i can't say anything for sure yet...but i'm still not going to deny the fact that this could be something from beyond. there's more out there than we can see for sure, i'll admit that.  thank you for the response, much appreciated."
Thetruthishere,39afu6,velezaraptor,4,Thu Jun 11 04:09:59 2015 UTC,"Umm...call the number again?  Is it still disconnected?  You aren't really going to find any meaningful answers here, unfortunately."

Thetruthishere,39afu6,velezaraptor,2,Thu Jun 11 04:05:03 2015 UTC,Curious.... Keep us informed! Sounds like either a thought-form has gone rampant or AT&T is glitched.

However it may not be what you are wanting to hear,  not to scare you. You never know what she is calling for. I have heard of these calls turning bad very quick devolving into horror movie territory. It could even be something pretending to be her."

Thetruthishere,39aw9i,Wildfire38p,3,Wed Jun 10 14:40:11 2015 UTC,"I don't like talking about it because it sounds crazy but I'm an empath myself. Its both a gift and a curse i guess. It allows me to see things from so many different perspectives, I'm able to help so many people. But i really have no sense of self. I'm always feeling other people's feelings so i really have no idea what I'm feeling. I can also tell when people are lying or thinking negatively about me. I mean those are great things at the appropriate times but some things i just don't need to know.   Sorry for writing so much. I just never talk about this.   I also like ""know"" things about people. Like a certain fact about their life that they haven't told me or alluded to but i just know it in my head. Sometimes i don't even realize they didn't tell me. And also, like random ""feelings"". like i know something is going to happen. It can be simple like a certain movie will be on tonight or we'er going out to dinner or whatever.   please pm me if you want to talk. I never talk to anyone about this stuff but id be glad to help or whatever. sorry for being so long winded"
Thetruthishere,39aw9i,octopusdixiecups,2,Thu Jun 11 05:17:02 2015 UTC,Just want to let you know you're not alone.  As a fellow empath I have undergone many of the same of experiences.  I even suffered some serious issues when I was younger since I was too inexperienced to filter all of the emotions of everyone around me.  I completely understand what you mean about it being both a curse and a blessing.  It's a hard gift to carry but well worth it if you see it through.
Thetruthishere,39aw9i,snowydusty,2,Sun Jun 14 20:56:58 2015 UTC,dido on that.

Thetruthishere,39aw9i,Radium_Coyote,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:11:15 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. It seems like my mother and those before her all had one specific gift. For her it was the gift of foresight. I've seen her accurately predict things that there is no way she could have known. As far as to why? I do not know. I don't understand the nature of these ""gifts""."

Thetruthishere,39aw9i,Radium_Coyote,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:23:00 2015 UTC,She views it as something she has always had. As lame as it sounds a sixth sense. It's as much a part of her as breathing. She has described it as sort of instinctual at times.
Thetruthishere,39aw9i,boredguy456,0,Wed Jun 10 18:03:11 2015 UTC,"Another stupid question, then.  Anyone who sees the future in any measure, sees her destiny.  Not to be a jerk about it, but someone has to be the jerk...  How does she anticipate her demise?"

Thetruthishere,395mqg,UniversalFarrago,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:47:07 2015 UTC,"...I would like some book titles.  Also, quick question. I've heard different people say different things regarding the fae; some say some are as advanced as we are, with sprawling cities and kingdoms that exist in a sort of parallel dimension that mirrors our continents, with some of its people tall and humanoid like us (elves, nokken), and others say it's just a bunch of small little spirits (santa elves, gnomes, sprites) living all happy together. Which (if any), in your opinion, holds more truth?  Literally all I know about fairies are these two things I eavesdropped on some people having a debate over."
Thetruthishere,395mqg,Carolann_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:56:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the delay in my response! I am most certainly not an expert on such things, but I will give you my opinion.  I definitely don't subscribe to the belief that fairies, elves etc. are cute little beings that cohabitate, but as to whether they are as advanced as us? I would say they are so different that it is difficult to compare. I think they are something to be respected, if not downright feared. I could go on forever with my beliefs...but I won't! :) I have grown up being fascinated with such things and one of the first books that I owned on the subject was a TimeLife book called the Enchanted World: Fairies and Elves. More recent reading of mine has been The Fairy Teachings by Orion Foxwood; Meeting the Other Crowd by Eddie Lenhan & Carolyn Eve Green; and Fairy and Folk Tales of Irish Peasantry by W.B. Yeats. All interesting stuff.  Hope this is what you were looking for."
Thetruthishere,395mqg,UniversalFarrago,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:57:08 2015 UTC,"No worries for the delay, and thank you!  When I said advanced, though, I didn't so much mean it in the technological way, but more in societal ways. Governments, hierarchy, language, etc. A true society with art and all that jazz.Does that seem more likely, assuming they are real?"
Thetruthishere,395mqg,marshallkathy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:16:31 2015 UTC,"Your questions are intriguing. In many of the stories I've read/heard, they often speak of a fairy ""court"", complete with kings, queens, princes et al. So I suppose I would have to say yes as to the question of a hierarchy. Language is a given, with different dialects spoken I'm sure. As sure as I can be! So you could definitely draw similarities to our own species/societies."

Thetruthishere,393idk,0verTheRainb0w,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"Well, the first thing that happened to me was being in my room alone with no t.v. or music on studying, and in my ante-room hear somebody sneeze. I said bless you, and then promptly freaked the hell out because I was 110% alone. I grabbed a bat, and looked--there was no one--I took 3 quick steps to get in the room nobody could have unlocked the door and gotten out in that time, the door sticks, and makes an awful screech when you open it. Patrolled the entire house, found no one.The ante-chamber is pretty vacant, and the guy seemed to hang out in the corner there. The room that was unbearably hot, as it took on direct sun, became freezing cold for 2 days that summer. My brother heard it/he cough one night, and immediately knew it was a man he cared for who had recently passed. Smokers hack? At one point it made a cough noise right next to my face and the air moved my bangs. I was pissing myself, and went and stayed with a friend. Apparently, the guy stayed 3 or 4 days at most, my brother said he talked to him, and explained he was dead ect. I don't think he knew he had passed, I wondered if ghosts cough/sneeze or if they think they're still alive and do that for that reason? My brother thought he did it so he would know who it was--they were distinct noises to this guy. I am happy he didn't stay the feeling of being watched gives all kinds of stress."
Thetruthishere,393idk,CatzAgainstHumanity,2,Mon Jun 15 00:36:56 2015 UTC,"I have no idea if what you saw was real or not, but the thought of seeing something like that, something so inexplicable, is wild.

I was tight with the Raytheon guys and they serviced my shit, said they had no idea what the fuck caused it. The second time we were doing a assist on a group trying to feel out some HVT's shit was quite and everything was fine. The lead operator called no joy and we maintained our position to provide cover in the valley if needed. I didn't figure we were needed because haji don't surf and it was all smooth. I checked random movements and confirmed no threat with my spotter. I swept over a window and saw the same burning eyes, my spotter concurred and we both had a little bit of a wtf moment. I go to look again and we were finally clear to withdrawal so we packed it in. Weird shit over there man, I talked to a translator about some of the shit and he said that conflict can bring shit like that out but who knows."

He said in the dream, there were a bunch of clotheslines with white sheets, so he couldn't see much. He started navigating in between, and when he eventually rounded the corner of one, he saw this indescribably horrible face. When he saw it, something in his mind told him it was called a Jinn (in that way that things just make sense to you in dreams).  He woke up the next morning and looked it up, having had no knowledge prior to that dream that such a thing even existed. That in itself is the part that gets me.  2spooky4me, man."

Thetruthishere,38z2gd,ThaBenMan,13,Mon Jun 8 03:30:15 2015 UTC,"A genie, basically. In old Arabic folklore, they were spirits made of ""smokeless fire"". A wizard with the proper knowledge could bind them, usually to an object like a ring or a lamp. But free and unbound, they supposedly wander the wild deserts and trick and torment the unwary."

Thetruthishere,38z2gd,T-S-Erik,18,Mon Jun 8 04:40:36 2015 UTC,"Jinn are what demons are called in Islamic(Arabic) theology/folklore.  People often think that these entities/characters are different things entirely because of the differing names, but that's not quite the case. Though they may have different mystery surrounding them, they are in essence the same things.  Remember that Islam is an Abrahamic religion. The same family as Judaism and Christianity. In Judaism they are called ""shedim"" or ""dybuk"" or ""mazzikim"". In Christianity ""demons"" or ""fallen angels"".   In Hinduism they are called ""asura"" or ""rakshasa"". Buddhism calls them ""maras"". Zoroastrianism calls them ""daevas"". The ancient Chinese folk religions called them ""yaoguai"". In Gnosticism they are called, ""Archons"".  All these creatures, strangely, share the same concepts even though the ideas were found in varying cultures before their interaction. They are all known as inhuman spirits not ""born"" into this world. They all reject the source of ""good"" in the universe and became corrupt. They are all known as deceivers and tempters of humanity and are known to take different forms.  Whether you say: Büch, kitab, libro, biblio, kniga, or hon, they all refer to the same thing. A book.  It's all quite interesting to think about."
Thetruthishere,38z2gd,iamadogforreal,10,Mon Jun 8 12:43:25 2015 UTC,"Buddhism calls them ""maras""   In Buddhism, there is only one Mara. There are supernatural creatures in Buddhism of course (the Buddha travels to lower realms and often teaches them Buddhism to free them from their suffering).  Mara isn't a serious villain by any means.  He's more of a distraction from the path and I believe in the Pali Canon, the Buddha eventually converts him to Buddhism. He's seen more like a lost and pitiful character than some fearsome and evil mastermind.   It's all quite interesting to think about.   The problem with these types of comments is that its all quite reductionist. Demons in Buddhism have little on common with Christian mythology, Jinn are different the Christian demons, etc.   That said, there's probably a practical reason for having ""evil"" characters in religion. Its something that you can scare the populace with to make sure they show up in the pews every sunday.  Religions with strong good vs evil points of view are pretty primitive and if there's a connection in some religions with evil characters, it probably has more to do with these religions being fairly primitive philosophies and not progressing to more nuanced views.  I think things like paranormal sightings, ghosts, jinn, etc remain 100% unexplainable and the frameworks we have via religion are distracting us from understanding these things better."
Thetruthishere,38z2gd,MRMiller96,8,Mon Jun 8 14:27:48 2015 UTC,"From what I remember, the Djinn are closer to the Celtic Fae then Christian Demons."
Thetruthishere,38z2gd,iamadogforreal,10,Mon Jun 8 15:58:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my understanding is that they have an arbitrary morality, just like humans. There are lots of stories of Jinn helping lost travelers, helping lost children, etc amongst the scary stories.  I think its weak sauce to compare them to Christian Demons."
Thetruthishere,38z2gd,T-S-Erik,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:02:13 2015 UTC,"They have the will to act, however they are held to a morality structure as humans are, in that, they are judged at Yawm ad-Dīn. Some of the traditions, like the Salafi tradition, view all djinn as evil deceivers."
Thetruthishere,38z2gd,T-S-Erik,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:38:56 2015 UTC,"Though remember, the devil figure in Islam IS a djinn. The shaitan djinn are analogous to other Abrahamic demons."
Thetruthishere,38z2gd,T-S-Erik,3,Mon Jun 8 19:30:58 2015 UTC,"There is more than one mara, or at least more than one manifestation. The Śūraṅgama Sūtra mentions the fifty maras that are manifest from the five skandhas. The preferred English translation is ""The Fifty Skandha Demons"".   I agree that the maliciousness of the evil spirits varies from culture to culture, and tale to tale, but I'm not sure how that is an objection to my point.  I didn't say all variations of an evil spirit were exactly the same. Or at least, didn't intend to. They are analogs. The claim of being too reductionist I don't quite agree with. The only way to compare ideas like this are to begin with the foundation, then explore from there. From base details to finer points.  Yes djinn are separate entities from angels. However the shaitan djinn are supernatural beings of energy (smokeless fire) that have spurned God to follow Iblis (Azazel). It's important to remember that the Devil figure in Islam is a djinn.   In Christianity demons are supernatural beings of energy (not born into a body) that have spurned God to follow Lucifer.  In Chinese mythology, the yaoguai are most often fallen heavenly beings who have supernatural powers, and try to attain immortality to be worshipped as gods.  Yes, they differ in the finer points, and to call it conclusive in and of itself is silly. However, to dismiss the similarities is equally silly. They're analogs, but not exact copies. I find interesting the similarities interesting.  Actually, I think you'll find that the emergence of monotheistic ""good vs evil"" religions tend to show up later in established society, (as with Judaism, and Zoroastrianism) not primitive ones. Primitive cultures tend towards types animism and ancestor worship where spirits and gods are capricious, with various cults trying to win favor of the supernatural entities.  Certainly the paranormal, should it exist, is still a mystery. I wouldn't argue otherwise. However, I can't agree that examining these from all angles, including religious thought, is a distraction."
Thetruthishere,38z2gd,iamadogforreal,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:29:09 2015 UTC,"not primitive ones.    My point is that theocracies and modern secular states with high religiosity are still primitives, in the modern sense - compared to low religiosity societies.   The preferred English translation is ""The Fifty Skandha Demons"".    That seem to be a translation thing. Mara, the trickster demon/god, in Buddhist mythology is a singular being.   At least from the Theravada tradition."

""Maras"" is just lazy translating.   In some traditions, sure. I agree. However, not according to the Śūraṅgama Sūtra (and the Siddha tradition). It has a chapter that specifically details the fifty skandha-māras (plural in the original text, not just translations) where the five Skandha each have 10 emanations known as skandha-māras. These are states that embody different undesirable or evil states. In some Buddhist tradition these are mere psychological concepts, but in the theistic Buddhist traditions they are seen as entities."

Thetruthishere,38rc71,BubblingMonkey,28,Sat Jun 6 03:49:51 2015 UTC,"I think when I saw the creator of this subreddit mention /r/Thetruthishere on /r/nosleep or in a thread concerning it (which is when I immediately checked it out and subscribed), the talk about truth wasn't so much about whether the encounters, experiences posted here have a truth to them in a straightforward way (i.e. someone claims they encountered a demon, and it really was a demon), but whether the person experiencing it really has experienced it, even if only in their own subjective way (often though posters say that others around them experienced it aswell!). Even if it really was just a raccoon in an attic, a hallucination, whatever, the fact that you experienced it is true. I think that this subreddit's creator wanted a place for actual stories rather than what has become of nosleep, because, as I've seen mentioned in other threads, for example, on Askreddit, often times people post their actual experiences in nosleep and wanted to talk about it, but since it wasn't as interesting or didn't have as good writing as one of the fictional stories, no one responded to them.   I, for example, logically don't believe in ghosts or the supernatural, but my own personal experiences have left me confused and unsure, I can't find logical explanations to all of them. It doesn't mean that I've started to believe any of those things you've listed, it just means that I'm open to explanations that may be different than the typical ones you can get."

Congrats to this sub for that.   As I said though, I haven't been back for quite some time and your post was the first I saw. So, I'll respond with a bit of what I believe.   spirits, god, afterlife, heaven/hell, reincarnation, demons, etc.   In my opinion every one of these things is energy based. Be it positive/creation or negative/destruction. (IE: Perceived good vs evil). Then of course there is the implication of what ""truth"" means. And it's relation to ""fact"" or what is known and even unknown. The biggest thing IMO to remember is, your perception of a thing does not change that thing. So, if I perceive you to be a female but you are in fact, male. My perception doesn't alter the reality of you. The same would hold true for all things.   Going further from there. My perception/beliefs on, to pick one, demons, would be simply a congregation of negative energy. Built up over X years in a given area. Generally related to horrible acts perpetrated by humans in homes or over certain grounds. That then uses a person as a catalyst or way to manifest. Usually a teen or severely distraught adult.   They say opposites attract but I don't think that holds true when talking about these kinds of forces. IE: Prayer, Meditation, Mass Murders, Horrific Deaths ECT.. It seems to me that prayer over one single positive thought focused on by many minds collects and sometimes gives positive results.   So, there you have both ends of the spectrum. What we perceive as Demons and Miracles. Am I right? I honestly have no idea but that is what I believe.

I know there's a large interest in books like journey of souls to explain some of this stuff, but there's certainly no universal agreement. Even that view is highly western/american focused and doesn't address things indigenous and middle Eastern and African and Asian cultures experience. Which makes sense as everyone hypnotized in those books is american so that limits the experience.  To be fair, The books do seem to tie in to more universal experiences we see in near death experiences and Asian style reincarnation.  I personally find people into this stuff have s watered down Buddhist philosophy. They accept reincarnation, meditate, try to be less material obsessed, etc.  ""Truth"" here means no fiction allowed. This sub is supposed to be the opposite of nosleep, which is a creative writing sub. Hope that helps."

As the video host says, physics ""proves"" that the force of a person's fingers moves it. That's nice. Obviously the fingers are moving it.   Where is the explanation of: (1) why is our subconscious choosing to spell out certain words? (2) why is one person's subconscious ""stronger"" than another person's subconscious and results in the spelling of words (i.e. there's two or more people on the board, who's subconscious is doing the work and why?), (3) why are some peoples' subconscious better/faster/clearer at spelling out words on a board than others?, and (4) where is the proof that it is the subconscious moving it and not some other internal force that is impacted by spiritual forces?

In complete subconscious love with the young lady, OP persuades all theater staff to ""know"" about the mystic ring. Random stuff happens and the crowd goes wild! A quick ""Yes"" I saw what you just said you saw, ""Yes, yep and yup!"" OP gets an unannounced invite to walk her home and seizes the opportunity.   The sympathy and consoling are masked with chivalry and good intentions. OP completes the cover up by posting the story and mentioned it to her to finalize the last ditch attempt out of the ""friend zone"". All this distraction has to lead somewhere, right?

You're right. As a theatre person, I am heavily invested in the invisible, especially with my art. But there's always that fear of being brushed off as a crazy artist by the outside that makes me play everything down in hindsight, I think.  When it was going on, there was even serious talk of involving a priest friend of ours, but our community is so small, everyone knows everyone. Although Joshua and I had never worked together, I had seen him around, and we had friends in common.

You can be sure of that.  Suicide is wrong by man's law, not God's.    And yes, God is real.  I was raised in a church-going family but never believed it.   But some things have happened over the past decade that have led me to know God.  Not believe:  Know."
Thetruthishere,38c9qt,butteryoatmeal,2,Thu Jun 4 06:21:38 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, what made me ask that question was probably my anxiety of if there is anything after death. That's why I am here. Ever since I was 17, I have started having existential crisis, at times I would sleep for maybe an hour a night throughout the week, sometimes not at all. It still goes on. I was always raised a Catholic and, on my dads side, a Baptist. Even so, ever since I was 17 I have been in a self conflict on belief. I guess you can say I am not a strong person in belief, I usually like signs or something a little more concrete that can't be explained. I never had paranormal experiences, at least none that I can confirm, like this experience. If I were to count some that would feel paranormal, then maybe around 5 off the top of my head. My wife is a strong believer in spirits and that our loved ones are watching over us still. Anyway, I have been in a self conflict with myself, Catholicism vs Atheism. I guess I can't really identify as either, I think I fit in the Agnostic area. I want to believe, but I feel I have no grounds to really put confidence in my belief. Even so, I also think many people just do not truly know. Everyone can say they do or don't, I just don't think, at least on the Atheist side, we have the scientific tools or study to determine whether or not that all that is true. That is why I am here, I want to hear stories that can give me faith. It is refreshing and makes me less scared of the future. Right now I am currently learning about reincarnation and the like, I saw that interview everyone talks about with Michael Newton on his book. It is very interesting, and I find it more interesting that he stated that he was an ""Atheist kicking and screaming on converting to believing in something,"" he fought hard to keep his atheist identity, but according to him, his patients convinced him that there was something despite anything he could do to disprove them.  Anyway, I think that's why I originally asked that question with her. I would love to think it is real, but to me, I just could never know. I want her to visit again, but I feel that they can only conjure enough energy to visit us once, make their peace with us, then continue on to where they are going.[1] Granted, she could have visited me in the cemetery, and if she did, then maybe she had enough energy to visit again. My question is, why can't she visit me in a dream, tell me how she is? I miss her deeply, when I think about her I am always in tears. I want to hug her again, even if she says she is happy and at peace, I still want to know how she is. I feel like it will be hard to find peace with this, I have nothing against her, I just wish I could have done more for her.   [1] That being said, I have no clue what is on the other side for them to go to. As a Catholic, we treated suicide as a sin nonetheless. To us, it was disrespecting god and the gift of life he has given us. Therefore a suicide was sent to hell, but not too extreme, but it was bad enough because technically we ""defied God."" That year she killed herself, my English class read Dantes Inferno(great timing right? Right after her death....) It got to the part where Dante saw the people who killed themselves. People, souls, who were in the form of trees, stuck like that for eternity while crows and other birds slowly picked away and ate at their being. It was something that stuck with me, because even though I didn't want to believe it, what I have been taught in CCD is what I feared for her. I feared she would be in Hell, suffering that fate, all because I couldn't save her from her nightmare she lived. Then, I found reincarnation, I read that no matter who the soul was, they still found peace and harmony in the afterlife, until they were ready to be another person. Depending on what they did, is what their mission was in the next body to not make those mistakes, or around that sense. It was basically saying that we go through multiple lives until we can become a pure spirit full of peace, and we have to go through multiple lives before we can attain that purity. It gave me hope, especially when I realized that her parent shad another baby. It struck me, could that be her now? Is that why she doesn't visit me? She is assigned to a new body and she will live as a new person? If so then what about the cemetery? The baby was born, but my fiance said that she felt my friends presence. I have so much to learn, but I am holding on strong to everything. Hopefully I can find these answers, and then hopefully I can live at peace knowing what I know."
Thetruthishere,38c9qt,butteryoatmeal,3,Thu Jun 4 08:03:38 2015 UTC,"I understood all of that from your text.  Now a little of my background so you might understand where I'm coming from.    I was raised Mormon, in the southern US.  I just couldn't believe the biblical stuff, despite it being infused into literally every aspect of my life.  It wasn't resistance on my part either.  It was simply a lack of faith.  This drove me into the loving arms of science.  So for years I was sheltered in the beauty of accepting nothing without concrete, tangible proof.  That is, until bizarre things started happening around me.  I still don't know why they did, but I have experienced just about everything supernatural/paranormal that a person can.  This includes direct, personal experience of God.  I know what I know.    One of those bizarre events led me to being learning qigong.  I didn't know anything about it before that but there was some ""insistence"" that I do that.  So I did.  From the very beginning, the world opened up to something almost magical.  The bizarre events escalated.  But so did my inner knowledge and I began to start accumulating that mustard seed of faith that Jesus spoke of.  You'll never understand just how huge a mustard seed is until you give that a go as one who has no faith in anything.  I also know that God does not punish us for our choices.  How could your friend be happy if she's in hell?  Her hell was here, on Earth, at the hands of her fellow man.  Why would God then cast her into eternal pain for that?  He gave us free will, did he not?  He did.  And we don't use it.  We prefer to follow the scribblings of power-mongers and those of malevolent intent.  Our religious texts may be very loosely based on God's word for us, but they have long been corrupted by those who wanted control over us.    She can visit you in your dreams or whenever, but maybe she doesn't need to.  She didn't exist for you.  You need to make peace with yourself over what happened.  It wasn't about you then and it's not about you now.  If your behavior was other than optimal, that's not for her to deal with.  That's for you and your heart to sort out.  Your soul is telling you something there.  Be sure you learn the lesson(s).  You really do have a lot to learn. That's a great place to start."
Thetruthishere,38c9qt,butteryoatmeal,2,Thu Jun 4 08:33:29 2015 UTC,"I do have a lot to learn.  I feel like I have had prayers answered. Sometimes when I am at my lowest times, I pray and beg for something to make me happy. I have had bad relationships, I asked God to help me make a decision. Once that decision was made, my life, my soul, my happiness has been improved 10 fold. I am a much better person than I was before then, and I am continuing to become a better one now.   I can't believe the biblical stuff entirely, it feels like a game of whisper down the lane, but at the mercy of the ones writing it. They can write whatever they want to tell us how to live, I know the bibles of today aren't the same as the ones 2000 years ago.   Anyway, I think it is more of me hating myself for letting her do this. I have always wanted to help people, I love protecting people, that's what I am doing now. I am a firefighter, studying to become a police officer, and I am working my ass off to enlist. I want to serve, I want to protect, I want to be the light in peoples darkest times. I want to be the sheep dog that fights that wolf off from the sheep who can't defend themselves. Maybe that's why I can't find peace, it's because I feel like I couldn't save her. I know I can't save everyone, and I will have to expect that as people will die in my hands. It's not that I think I can save everyone, it's that no matter what I want to do my best to save them. Maybe her suicide was her salvation, like you said, she was in hell. As long as she has found peace, who am I to question her actions? Yes it hurts, but at least she is happy.   I will look up that qigong term, maybe it will help me out like it did you."

Looking at the rest of your info there, I doubt it will appeal to you much.  It would require you going very far outside your comfort zone.  I don't know how much that would benefit you.  There are other ways, I suppose, but that will be for you to determine.  My way was my way.  Know though that you weren't supposed to save her.  She was your lesson.  You aren't supposed to play god or savior.  People need to choose their own paths through their lives.  Someone as unsure of things as you are should spend more time learning and less time trying to interfere.    How can you aspire to be for others what you don't know yourself?"

Don't know if I'm using that term properly, but often when I've been tossing and turning for a while I'll enter into a state a bit between dreaming and being awake. I think that everything that is happening in my mind is real, and I'll usually even think that my eyes are actually open, but I won't actually open them until I make the conscious decision to sit up and move, which jars me back to reality. It's like my mind is active but I've been laying down trying to sleep for so long that my body is trying to go to sleep. Don't know if I explained that well enough, but maybe you'll somehow relate hahah.  Edit: The only reason I'll ever notice that it isn't real is because I have a digital clock in my room, and I'll begin to experience weird things and then look at the clock and it will say a time wayyyyy later than it should be, so I'll sit up kind of startled cause I'll need to be waking up soon, at which point I'll come back to and look at the clock again and in reality only ten or so minutes have passed."
Thetruthishere,38b1wx,Bradybigboss,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:50:49 2015 UTC,"So rather than full on sleep paralysis, almost more of a waking-dream sort of experience where you're lucid but not entirely 'awake' or 'asleep' still. Could be!   I did have a real 'fever dream' moment once when I was younger actually. Sick with food poisoning and puking all night, I looked at a strange little porcelain figurine that has been on a shelf in our house for years. I used to have nightmares of this figurine growing to be the size of a human (it's only around 9 inches tall, a little hunter looking fellow complete with a cute little shotgun) and chasing me around the house. Anywho, I was sleeping in our guest room so my Dad could watch me during the night to make sure my condition wasn't getting worse. I was puking a lot, but that was it. When I first reached the room to make my bed though, I closed the blinds on the window and turned around and looked at the figurine, and the fucker blinked at me. I got incredibly lightheaded and dizzy and this site but managed to walk on, noting that it was just in my head. It's freaky how your head can warp things like that though, especially when you're tired and distressed.   I get what you're trying to say though. I had tossed and turned both these nights, and couldn't fall asleep. It was likely just my tired brain playing games with my tired eyes! It wasn't a terrifying moment really, as something like sleep paralysis would be incredibly distinct, but it was still just a little unnerving to have happened twice!  Hasn't happened since though, but I've been gone for the past 4 days, went on a fishing trip with my dad."
Thetruthishere,384sp7,hannaguist,50,Mon Jun 1 21:20:26 2015 UTC,"In the house that my family lives in, where I also lived before I got married, I once woke up during the night to a woman standing in the corner of my room. She was middle aged, not fat, but ""soft"", and had brown hair that was pinned up. She was wearing a dress made out of a fabric with a a sort of checked pattern on it, like the kind of dress that you would imagine someone would wear to a barn dance. I don't remember exactly what she said , except that she was very nice, and that she was asking me if I liked square dancing.   I remember at the time being almost in shock; I wasn't scared OF her, she seemed excited, like she just really wanted to talk to me; I was just plain scared, that there was an anomalous woman in my bedroom. I remember laying back down and covering my head with the blanket, and closing my eyes tight, hoping she would disappear. After that I must have fallen back asleep, and everything was fine. i figured I had either had a paranormal experience, or a really odd dream, since I clearly remember waking up out of sleep when it happened.   Years later, my cousin was staying out here at my parent's house for his summer break from college. One day after sleeping over there in my old bedroom, he starts telling me that the weirdest thing happened, and he woke up during the night to a woman standing in the corner of the room. He went on to describe the exact same woman, down to the dress, and tell me that she was trying to talk to him about square dancing. My jaw just dropped open. I had never told him about her.

Thetruthishere,384sp7,Casehead,12,Tue Jun 2 17:16:49 2015 UTC,"Something similar happened to me.   When I was in middle school I slept over my cousins house. Let's call her Sally. For some reason I didn't sleep in her room, opted for the guest room. Looking back, that's bizarre. Like... that is just not a cool slumber party. Then again my cousin's were assholes, and she was probably pissed at me for something.   While I was attempting to sleep I felt, did not see, something in the room, in the corner near the ceiling. I felt a little blonde boy wearing a fluffy white, Victorian pajama dress. His skin lit as if by moonlight. I was scared. But somehow I felt the boy tell me he won't hurt me, to calm my tits. I was pretty relieved and fell asleep.   Years later I told the story to my cousin's as a fun, inane childhood story. After hearing my story, Sally nonchalantly told me she experienced the same boy (with the exact physical descriptions) but at a different age, when she was around 5ish.   This is her story: She awoke to seeing the boy in the corner just staring at her. Sally turns to her mother, ushering her to wake up, says there's some weird kid in the room. When her mother turned to her, Sally told me her moms face was all jacked and her voice sounded demonic. After her mom yelled at her and ignored her pleas, Sally confused and stunned fell asleep eventually. Then a strange phenomenon happened, the next day everything that came out of Sally's mouth sounded incomprehensible to her, but to everyone else she made sense. This affliction lasted for about a month. No idea what that is.   So, the major differences between what happened to her and I are that she saw him and I intuited him. And the obvious, we saw him at different times. What is slightly creepy is knowing that this thing followed her. And what I found out later is that the room I slept in the furniture was arranged exactly the way it was back then except she lived in another house.  Other freaky stuff happened to her and I but this is the one thing we both can confirm by each other."

Or maybe it was a temporary variant of it that manifested differently....i don't know.  We'd like to hear more stories please"
Thetruthishere,384sp7,BloodyPearl,2,Thu Jun 4 04:50:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly but hope it works: /u/emofather  Her head was fine so, I have no idea. I guess I'd like to clarify that her mother is a very lovely woman and they are close. What happened to her is bizarre, I wish there was a rational explanation.  It's strange that despite all these incidents my family and I never spoke about them until years later. I wonder why that happens? It's almost as if we don't believe it ourselves. I suppose I'll flesh out everything here, for some reason I don't feel comfortable making an original post about this stuff. I guess because it's all very scattered.  My cousin's experiences  After my cousin and I revealed our mutual experiences, it was not until years later that we started talking about it more. Again, it's strange that we just didn't make a huge deal about it. Now it's different because I realize it kind of IS a big deal. I mean what happened to us seems statistically low but I guess a low statistic doesn't prevent it from occurring. But still, it's pretty crazy. What was revealed to me was that my cousin had more experiences and they were always visual, meaning she'd see stuff.  In the same house that I slept over, she told me she'd see people and apparitions. For the entire time she lived there, she said she saw an old woman walking around sometimes and would hear the soft shuffling of slippers on the floor. Another time she saw her floating near a tall tree, near a branch as if she were hung. But she wasn't, she was just really high up. The old lady's back was to her.  YEARS later she told her mother about it, and her mom revealed that the home was owned by an old man and his wife passed away there.  She also saw a humanoid figure, looked like a man, with ""black dust"" swarming all around him. He didn't have a face. She was watching tv from the living room. He casually walked across the living room into the hallway which blocked her view.  Actually my cousin recently experienced something in her apartment, she's married now. She was on her balcony, probably smoking, and witnessed some milky thing slowly fly across her room. She described it as like a piece of cloth sailing through, and disappeared through a wall. What's weird is that her yorkshire terrier also saw it. Her dog was in the house, and started to follow it. My cousin said her dog's head was slightly cowering as if unsure on how to proceed.  Wow, this post is really long. But I do have more stories because it seems a lot of people in my family have stories to tell.  My cousin's mom also had something weird happen to her. Years ago my cousin and her parents were having dinner, her mom was in the kitchen cutting stuff. While my cousin and her father were at the dinner table, her mom started telling her that she had a weird dream about her brother. She said her brother came to her and told her he'd be going away somewhere. I think he said he won't be back for a long time or something. While she was telling her story they get a phone call, and she discovers that her brother passed away.  Strange. She also said her mother had a dream about my mother, my mother told her to take care of me. My mother passed away when I was very young. I don't really make much out of it, probably just a dream.  My experiences  I remember two vivid memories. It was late and I was trying to sleep. It usually took a while for me to sleep so it wasn't uncommon for me to lay in bed and just think about stuff. Back then I had a maltese as a pet and she would frequently sleep on my bed. My parents were asleep in their room, they are usually asleep early because of work. With traffic, we lived in an hour away from central Los Angeles. Their bedroom also faces mine so I could see them. As I was laying there I heard something run up the stairs. For a second I thought it was my dog and waited for her to come in and jump on the bed and lay next to me. That never happened, and that was when I realized my dog was next to me all along. I was slightly scared but I forgot about it.  Next, this was years before. Similar to the previous situation I was laying in bed trying to sleep and my step-brother came in and left me a random gift on my desk. I forget the minor physical details but it was definitely a figurine. I think I remember two figures sort of melded into one design. Again I was trying to sleep but I couldn't because I became paralyzed with fear. There was a growing sense of dread and horror in me, everything felt heavy. In my mind there was something wrong with this object, so I did that thing where I kept my feet covered and my bed sheets up to my nose because I was terrified as a kid. After a few minutes it talked to me. It said very loudly and clearly my name with a sort of husky, demonic voice. I fucking ran out of that room so fast and literally demanded my dad to get rid of it, I didn't want to touch it. Thinking on it, my dad is pretty cool for getting rid of it and not making a fuss. Yeah, it could be that I psyched myself into hearing something but all I know is that I was fully awake and the sound was very crisp and clear. FYI my step-brother is not the kind of person who pulls practical jokes on people. I'll ask him, though.   Other things would happen where I tend to get feelings about things and they would happen or something would happen related to what I felt. It happens a lot. They're always specific. My fiance thinks it's kind of freaky.   Lastly, this story is about my aunt from my dad's side of the family. She lives in northern California. From what I've heard, she is quite mentally unstable but this one particular story is really freaky to me. She is a very materialistic woman. My aunt gave or lent furniture to my cousin's a long time ago. Out of nowhere, for a day or two, she would incessantly call my cousin's parents and worry about her furniture. She would ask constantly if they were broken or damaged and to check again and again. She was adamant that there was something wrong with it. My cousin's parents reassured her they were fine and that she was being irrational. Two or three days later the big California earthquake hit and ALL her furniture was destroyed.  I think that's it for now... there's actually some more stories but my fingers hurt, lol."

Thetruthishere,382qca,Snak_The_Ripper,22,Mon Jun 1 12:53:10 2015 UTC,"One possible explanation is that if you're typically asleep at 2 am most nights, you may have been tired and as you sat there, your brain may have begun slipping into Hypnagogia, which can often include auditory and even visual hallucinations. This would also help explain your ""premonition"" feeling - your brain triggered some small concept of something unseen and your subconscious mind rapidly expanded on it into something weird.  A note on the birds - some birds will have one member of a group that will chirp even its sleep to trick predators into thinking they're awake. Others will continue to sing or chirp well into the night if there is a street light or other artificial light source, because they think it's day and they're trying to defend their territory against other birds. It's fairly common."
Thetruthishere,382qca,Pickleburp,12,Mon Jun 1 18:10:45 2015 UTC,"I like this explanation, it is very plausible. I'm usually going to asleep around 2 am, but the past few weeks I've been staying up later due to the nice weather. I've never knowingly experienced hypnagogia before, but I'll be more aware of when something happens to consider this in the future."
Thetruthishere,382qca,Pickleburp,3,Mon Jun 1 18:51:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it used to freak me out until I began studying it. Now I just sort of stop and think ""well, that was weird."" It can still get my adrenaline pumping, sort of like when you dream you're falling and wake up right before you hit the ground (also typically a manifestation of hynogogia, sensations of ""falling"" while lying down). I had one last week where I was on the verge of falling asleep and I suddenly heard what sounded like someone yelling my name right next to the bed. Woke me right up and took me a second to realize what it was."
Thetruthishere,382qca,Pickleburp,5,Mon Jun 1 19:28:53 2015 UTC,"Once I had been awake for 50 hours, because teenagers like to push boundaries. I had the the most intense visual hallucinations I think I'll ever had; I lost all sense of depth, I saw a demon standing behind my dresser (which was against the wall), dog-sized spider creatures everywhere, a taller than my ceiling, white robbed figured sashaying out of my room, my ceiling bleeding, and so much more. I think it would be interesting to look into more about this, as you have."
Thetruthishere,382qca,ellipsisms,3,Mon Jun 1 19:35:28 2015 UTC,"I haven't been to the subreddit in a long time, but http://www.reddit.com/r/threekings is really interesting in this vein, and hopefully without having to stay up for that long. :) The concept/idea is to have a person go to sleep and then wake up and have a conversation with themselves in the mirror while their subconscious is very much still active, in a near sensory deprivation environment. A lot of people want to quickly point out that these are hypnopompic hallucinations, but I think there's still a lot of value even in those.  Also, I've never had hallucinations like yours, but I've also never stayed up longer than 36 hours. That's some crazy stuff."
Thetruthishere,382qca,BloodyPearl,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:43:57 2015 UTC,"That's what I was going to say. I had the craziest hallucinations due to sleep deprivation such as being in Bulgaria and thinking I was in Barcelona and on the same day thinking someone was sitting in our toilet in the middle of the night when all the people in my room were sleeping, hearing voices, leaving the shower door open because I was completely sure that there was something in my house trying to kill me, etc. The last one was from when I had been awake for 48h straight...never did that again."
Thetruthishere,382qca,Cern_Stormrunner,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:53:18 2015 UTC,"I like this explanation, since it clearly states that hypnagogia can lead to lucid dreaming, hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.

Thetruthishere,382qca,Gamewolf66,6,Mon Jun 1 18:54:07 2015 UTC,"I've experienced something similar many years ago.  When I was about eight years old something started showing up near my house.  It was extremely weird.  You could feel its presence very strongly, even pinpoint its location, but you could not usually see it.  When you did it was only a flash before it was no longer visible.  It never came close, just out in the woods or near the tree line watching from a distance.  After a year or so id didn't see or feel it around for many years.  I have only seen it once since then, but it was much more aggressive that time."
Thetruthishere,382qca,chadwickofwv,3,Mon Jun 1 18:35:00 2015 UTC,"I also had similar experience, but it happened in the evening (8:30 or 9 pm) while I was sitting on the couch watching tv. I felt my stomach drop and a sinking feeling of what I can only describe as despair-and I sensed something walking (for lack of a better term) around the side of my house and to the front door. Coincidentally-or not?- the bell/chime hanging beside my door dinged twice. In my minds eye whatever it was had extreme height but was hunched over. After a second or two more of feeling as though I had done something terribly wrong and my mom just caught me, the feeling went away. It was truly bizarre and terrifying."
Thetruthishere,382qca,Gamewolf66,5,Tue Jun 2 02:23:33 2015 UTC,"Many birds DO chirp all night long.  We have birds in our yard and surrounding area that chirp just as loudly at night as they do during the day.  Crickets and tree frogs make really loud noises at night, too.  BUT, if someone or something (dog, cat, whatever, not talking about monsters) walk near, they shut off like someone flicked a switch.  It could be that you had started to doze off and didn't realize it, and you heard something coming and in your sleep-groggy state your brain came up with the image that you saw in your mind's eye.  It could very well have just been a stray dog or even a drunk person wandering through, but the reason it got so quiet is because everything that had been making their night sounds up to that point shut themselves off as whatever it was approached.  That's a normal reaction for nature to have when someone they perceive as a predator approaches.  It could be that everything conspired to gang up on your senses and because of the late hour and you not used to being outside sitting at that hour, your mind just raced."

I was just thinking about posting about the difference between people who visually see obviously out of place things and people who ""feel"" them and see them in their mind. My ex husband was what you would call a psychic, and could see in his mind's eye the spirits around him, but never saw things with his eyes in a traditional sense.   As for this thing you saw, I feel like it seems our universe is coexisting simultaneously with others, or other dimensions, or time periods... I don't know. So many paranormal encounters seem to be that and it seems like there may be different levels at which our reality and another cross over. What you saw maybe was in a moment of very weak ""connection"" to your reality, does that make sense?  I have seen two separate stories from different people on here about seeing a thin humanoid, normally described as very pale, almost a luminous translucent white, who walks alternately on all fours and upright and looks to be lacking a lower jaw, like it has a permanent screaming appearance. Both those were outside at night near roads. Does that sound similar?"

Thetruthishere,382qca,butteryoatmeal,9,Mon Jun 1 14:03:39 2015 UTC,Watering at night allows the water to seep into the soil rather than evaporating in the heat of the sun.
Thetruthishere,382qca,ChrisSunHwa,7,Mon Jun 1 14:35:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would always water in the evening (7-8pm), but 2am seems a little weird, no?"

Thetruthishere,382qca,DreamHouseJohn,3,Mon Jun 1 16:49:40 2015 UTC,Someone that worked 2nd shift?
Thetruthishere,382qca,LiftedNative,2,Mon Jun 1 18:58:58 2015 UTC,"Well, not particularly.  The ground will be cooler the longer after sundown you go.  As long as it has time to seep well, the better for the earth, the insects, and obviously the plants.  There are less people potentially walking around at that hour too.  It's actually a very considerate time to do that as far as everyone is concerned."
Thetruthishere,382qca,Cryptole,2,Mon Jun 1 17:14:37 2015 UTC,"I think some (rich) people have sprinkler systems on a timer, so they wouldn't necessarily even need to be up."
Thetruthishere,3832b1,strangechic,4,Mon Jun 1 14:28:50 2015 UTC,"I think I know what you're talking about, and I think http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/18xznv/last_week_i_believe_i_had_my_first_paranormal/ this is what you're looking for."
Thetruthishere,3832b1,art_phreak,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:43:46 2015 UTC,Yes!! That's the one. Thank you so much! :)
Thetruthishere,3832b1,SailorSpaghetti,4,Mon Jun 8 12:53:46 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what story you're referring to, but can't for the life of me remember where it was posted.  I read it a loooong time ago.  I've been sifting through all the weird subreddits I frequent with no luck.  I feel like it was originally posted in an AskReddit.  I don't think there was ever a satisfying conclusion, though, and people seemed to doubt the OP after a while."

Thetruthishere,3832b1,AshamedPakiHenna,2,Tue Jun 2 12:41:49 2015 UTC,"I seem to recall that it was a comment, not an OP."
Thetruthishere,385ip1,AmGrill,2,Tue Jun 2 00:19:57 2015 UTC,Goat head is Baphomet; deer head would be Cernunnos/Hern.
Thetruthishere,385ip1,s70n3834r,2,Tue Jun 2 04:31:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I had no idea. Not sure if it was Hern, I did a quick Google search. Do you think there'd be some significance in seeing Hern?"
Thetruthishere,385ip1,s70n3834r,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:03:02 2015 UTC,I think so.
Thetruthishere,385ip1,saktii23,3,Wed Jun 3 04:36:04 2015 UTC,"Oh, but no idea of why?  Darn."
Thetruthishere,385ip1,neurofluxation,5,Wed Jun 3 04:49:09 2015 UTC,You probably hallucinated.  Baphomet is not real and is an invention of the Catholic Church from around the 1300's for use in condemning the Knights Templars of Occult Worship. The Knights Templars basically had control of a ton of money that everyone else wanted control of.
Thetruthishere,385ip1,BloodyPearl,2,Tue Jun 2 00:27:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have considered that as a possibility. But, I've never hallucinated before or after. It was last year.  And, what I saw didn't have wings like what is shown in the picture. It seems weird to me that I had never seen/heard of anything like that before and still hallucinated it, but that's probably true for a lot of hallucinations.   Edit: also, thank you for such a fast reply. (:"
Thetruthishere,385ip1,neurofluxation,2,Tue Jun 2 00:30:21 2015 UTC,"Could be subliminal, Baphomet is always depicted in media and news outlets... As well as statues     More:    * Baphomet    * Baphomet    * Baphomet    * Baphomet    * Baphomet    * Baphomet    * Baphomet       Don't even get me started on the ""one eye"" shit...

Thetruthishere,385ip1,theendishigh,3,Thu Jun 4 01:23:59 2015 UTC,where on earth did you find all that?
