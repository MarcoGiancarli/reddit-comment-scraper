ContagiousLaughter,3e30eu,SadGalaxy,-10,Tue Jul 21 17:05:20 2015 UTC,Why would you be an ex-pro gamer? It's not like you'd be physically unfit to play. Did he start getting his ass kicked so much by the younger gen that he decided to retire?
ContagiousLaughter,3e30eu,MrGuttFeeling,21,Tue Jul 21 17:34:16 2015 UTC,Cause he doesn't play at a professional level anymore
ContagiousLaughter,3e30eu,razington,3,Tue Jul 21 17:41:05 2015 UTC,"did a quick reddit search, this is what I found. I know nothing about professional gaming, but I figured I'll just leave this here.  https://www.reddit.com/r/csgobetting/comments/2l6ewk/fifflaren_leaves_nip/"
ContagiousLaughter,3e30eu,bromemeoth,3,Tue Jul 21 17:51:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, basically his team is the best that the game has ever seen, but he got into a slump and was obviously no longer good enough to continue keeping his team as the best in the world (87 straight LAN games without a loss).  He retired and now works full time at Twitch.tv and also does a lot of analysis desk appearances at tournaments across the world.  He's still probably good enough to play on a tier 1/2 team, but he preferred a less stressful route while still being involved in the scene."

ContagiousLaughter,3dyx2d,ihatecatsandpeople,3,Tue Jul 21 15:11:16 2015 UTC,"No the ""different character"" part. He is putting on an intentional affect in this video.  Even though he's explaining why he doesnt want the video online, he's still doing it in a joking way."

ContagiousLaughter,3dyx2d,thebrassthief,156,Mon Jul 20 21:25:01 2015 UTC,He's practiced telling that story 1000 times.
ContagiousLaughter,3dyx2d,PastelFlamingo150,214,Mon Jul 20 18:26:21 2015 UTC,And it worked. He told that story like a comedian would doing stand up. That's why it was so funny.
ContagiousLaughter,3dyx2d,CubonesDeadMom,80,Mon Jul 20 19:19:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed. His timing was spot on. And he crushed the punchline so hard that even I, a cynical ass-HOLE, who has literally made his living in comedy, AND who has seen this already, lost my shit.

ContagiousLaughter,3dyx2d,stanleyfarnsworth,10,Mon Jul 20 23:28:59 2015 UTC,Hah that's the exact line that made me think that as well.
ContagiousLaughter,3dyx2d,CubonesDeadMom,14,Tue Jul 21 00:05:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's possible he's never told that story before. Sometimes the goal of ""practice"" is to make every time as good as the first, where the emotion is raw. This didn't feel planned at all IMO. The end wasn't very orderly, lots of cussing and mumbling, but for the meat of it he was in the zone.  Have you had that feeling before, working in comedy, that the first time you do a bit has something special about it? I've done standup a few times at open mics, and I prefer to do new material because it feels more alive inside. I'm a total hobbyist about it and don't want to commit at this point to actually getting good, and in the meantime I do best when I've never said what I'm saying before.   Interested in any comic's opinion on this."
ContagiousLaughter,3dyx2d,helpful_hank,2,Tue Jul 21 05:44:59 2015 UTC,"Stand up usually involves repeatedly honing your bits. I feel like it loses life and spontaneity and joy that way. It goes from jazz to pop. I'd much rather improvise off the top.   Also, this totally could be this guy's first time to tell the story. I feel like he's a natural either way."
