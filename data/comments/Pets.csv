Here is one good article (of many) on how to choose a responsible breeder.   As for cats, I'm not sure what the allure of pedigreed cats is. Cats lack the plasticity that allows dog breeds to have different traits beyond just how they look. Cats are cats and personality depends a lot more on the individual cat than on the breed."
Pets,3e300d,Marzipan86,4,Tue Jul 21 16:36:38 2015 UTC,"There are some benefits of having particular breeds in cats, though yes I suppose a lot of the appeal of many breeds is their looks.  Some breeds (Siberian, Russian Blue, Sphynx) can have lower amounts of the allergy-causing proteins in their saliva, which means that someone normally allergic to cats would not be allergic to those specific cats.  Some breeds are selected to have higher (Bengal) or lower (Persian, British Shorthair) energy levels, so people can choose a cat that better fits their living situation."
Pets,3e300d,littlestray,2,Tue Jul 21 17:41:21 2015 UTC,"Bengals aren't, in a strict sense, domestic housecats. They are a result of breeding domestic housecats with hybrids (domestic housecat/Asian leopard cat mixes), i.e. wild cats.  As such they can't really be held to the same standards as domestic housecats."

I think most breed clubs list breeders on their websites, too. You'll want to make sure that these breeders do all of the appropriate health testing for the breed you're after, and you'll want to look for dogs that are bred for the temperament you need/work you need done. There's absolutely nothing wrong with getting a dog from a reputable breeder! Good luck on your search!"
Pets,3e300d,chuwo,3,Tue Jul 21 15:55:16 2015 UTC,"I am actually thinking of starting to breed cats, and have been showing my breeds (Maine Coon and Siberian) in regional shows for almost 2 years now.  Yes, I've been doing the health testing that is needed for my cats (HCM and SMA for the Coons, PKD for the Siberians), they came from highly reputable breeders, and they are performing well at the shows that we've attended.  It seems far easier to do research on pedigree dogs and where to get them than it is for cats.  There are some breed clubs for cats, but the biggest one for Maine Coons (MCBFA) has been undergoing restructuring for a long time and their breeder links are badly out of date.  The major international cat registration associations (TICA and CFA) have some breeder listings, but as they are year-long paid ads from the catteries there are far fewer listings than there are breeders.  I was mainly curious on how people went about looking for breeders; if there was a particular website they might check for listings (such as the registries, or perhaps some form of classifieds), or perhaps just Facebook and/or Google and searching there."

Pets,3e300d,tmstms,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:39:51 2015 UTC,"Check whether the breeder is registered with their local [breed of cat] association. I.e. Call the association & verify the breeder(s) you are looking at are registered, or look at the association website to see if they list registered breeders. The ones that are should be held to a higher standard or they lose their registration.   One idea for you in terms of the adopt vs special breed: good breeders sometimes have to re-home their breeding animals. My Burmese came from a very small (registered) breeder who was breeding show cats. My cat had been brought in to be the stud for her queens. He had an extremely minor genetic variation common in Burmese that would put him & any offspring that carried the gene in an inferior position for showing (it's a kink in the end of his tail, not noticeable visually but show judges feel for things like that). She couldn't bring in a new stud until she re-homed the boy she had (she was only set up for one stud). So we got him at almost 2 years old & he's the most perfect pet. We adore him & he's just loved to bits. I think some breeders hang on to their queens even when they're no longer breeding them as keeping them as a pet doesn't upset the breeding cats. It's a very specific situation but it never hurts to ask & we got him for the cost of his vaccinations, desexing etc. Cheaper than a kitten, plus we avoided all of the energetic kitten stage (although at 10 he's still an energetic kitten & loves to play). I definitely checked out the breeder's credentials before going ahead though. I have no interest in supporting the ""backyard breeding"" or kitten mill trades.  Just to let you know there are options for adopting a cat that needs a new home while also getting a breed you particularly want. Unbelievably no-one else was interested in taking this beautiful older Burmese boy. I guess everyone wants kittens."

There is no such thing as a scientifically hypoallergenic dog or cat breed. It's purely marketing and/or anecdotal: one breed, or even one individual from one breed, triggered one person's allergies less.  Allergies to cats and dogs are caused by dander: saliva, urine and skin cells. It has nothing to do with hair or fur (besides hair and fur being able to be coated in dander, like cats lick their fur). As you can imagine if you think critically for a moment, all cats and dogs pee and produce saliva and shed their skin cells.  Individuals can relate their own stories about certain breeds or individuals not triggering their allergies but at the end of the day there is zero science to back those assertions up.    To answer your question, you can attend dog or cat shows to meet breeders. That's one way."

Even though you've added a second litter box in the past and it didn't help, you really should have more than 1 litter box, especially with 2 cats. The rule of thumb is to have the same number of boxes per cat, plus one additional box. Make sure you are scooping daily, twice daily is preferred. Ask your vet if he/she thinks adding a prescription diet would help. Make sure the litter is not scented, and clumping litter. Make sure the boxes are located in a quiet, safe environment. Don't put one next to the washer/dryer or in a high traffic area. You will also want to clean the spots they have urinated on with a cleaner that gets rid of the ammonia of the urine. Also, I really think play is a great addition for a happy, confident cat. Encourage playtime on a daily basis. One last thing, are your cats de-clawed? That can also add to litter box issues."

We got an adolescent pup too, we crate trained him, but not for that long every day.  Crate training is not about locking a dog away for convenience, it's about giving them a safe place to retreat to.  It would be far better if you could dedicate a room to the dog when you're at work, move anything destructible out first obviously.  If you can't do that, then set up a part of a room that she can't get out of, with the crate left open in that part of the room, then she can still walk around, and retire to the crate in her own time.  Something like this, it doesn't need to be expensive, you could craft something just as effective by yourself with materials kicking around the house:  http://www.germanshepherds.com/forum/attachments/training-our-puppy-basic/48522d1363881343-crate-training-question-photo.jpg .  It's only a small dog, it wont need lots of space, but it should definitely have more than just a crate to turn around in.  You can still crate train her, but to lock her in a cage for 9 hours every day seems cruel.  Just imagine the pent up energy, you would be going crazy if had no freedom to move for 9 hours every working day, you need to be able to move around for your own sanity, the same goes for your dog."
Pets,3e2c0d,killit,6,Tue Jul 21 15:01:08 2015 UTC,"Crating her is not cruel at all! Look up tutorials on how to crate train. Use positive methods, and never associate bad things or punishments with the crate."

I left the crate open and put her favorite treat in it.  When she came back she noticed the treats and went in, ate them and got out. We then praised her and did nothing else, so she is relaxed around it,  I wish we would have had more time to adapt her but we were short.  This morning 10 minutes before leaving we put her in the crate with a new bone and her favorite toy. She cried a bit when we left but I hope she'll be fine.  I left her just enough space with a separator so she won't do her business."
Pets,3e2c0d,TacticalVulpix,2,Tue Jul 21 13:39:23 2015 UTC,"ASPCA Weekend Crate Training Guide  Perfectly normal to leave a teenage dog crated because they can't quite yet be trusted, but I wouldn't go 9 hours. As other commenters said, have to let her out once around lunch. If that's not an option, and you're able to modify the house, look at installing a dog door and sectioning off an inside area.   I don't know about your area, are large birds and coyotes a problem? Might have to build a dog run (Like a chicken/rabbit run?) outside attached to the dog door, so she's got run of inside and out."
Pets,3e2c0d,Marzipan86,3,Tue Jul 21 15:38:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what's going on with some comments in this particular thread. People have asked essentially the same question on this sub before, and the general consensus is that this is an acceptable practice as long as your dog is getting enough exercise and is let out immediately before and after being crated. At your dog's age, it's probably safer than allowing her to be loose in your home where she could potentially do damage to things your own or (worse) to herself. Staying in a crate during the day for now will reinforce her potty training. A lot of dogs have no issue peeing and pooping on a concrete surface, so an unfinished basement isn't the best option for a younger dog.   My suggestion is to try to find a doggy daycare that she can go to maybe 2 days a week so she isn't in her crate every single day until she can be trusted to be confined to a room, then allowed free rein in your house. That's what we did with our older dog when we first got her.  Another option is a bathroom. It's smaller than an entire basement, so they'll be less likely to make a ""mess"" that they'll have to be near. As a child, we never crate trained our dog, but baby-proofed the bathroom and removed the trash can and toilet paper so she could stay there during the day until she was responsible enough to be confined to the bedroom/bathroom, then, finally, the entire house. You could even do things in steps, crate, bathroom, bedroom (or other room), whole house."
Pets,3e2c0d,Thestolenone,3,Tue Jul 21 16:15:48 2015 UTC,"Try to train her to be OK in the house, it is easy to slip into the habit of crating for your own convenience. Dogs easily become inured to being shut in a crate, it is called learned helplessness and is a form of shutting down. There is a reason most Western countries have banned crates or strictly limit their usage. They are fine for short periods of time when you need to know where your dog is and that they are safe, but not for being shut in for hours and hours as the dog is unable to carry out natural behaviours to control their environment. You might be better making a whole room safe for her to stay in while you are away."
Pets,3e2c0d,hometowngypsy,3,Tue Jul 21 14:04:56 2015 UTC,Denning is a natural behavior for dogs. They like small spaces that are comfortable and familiar. Leaving a dog in its crate during a work day with a pee break at lunch is not going to negatively impact your pet as long as it gets social interaction and exercise the rest of the time.

Pets,3e2c0d,qbeanz,2,Tue Jul 21 17:29:13 2015 UTC,"Instead of a crate, set up a room for her to be in.  Similar to a crate, but with some more room to play, stretch, and move around.  I think it would be very confining to be in a crate for a 9 hour stretch without getting walked in between or let out to use the bathroom.  Younger dogs can only hold their bladder for about 6 hours.  It's not until they're a few years old that they can hold it up to 8 hours or more.  When my dog was young, we set him up in the foyer and put up fences so he couldn't get up the stairs or into the carpeted living space.  If he had an accident, it wasn't going to ruin anything, and he had room to run and stretch and play.  Once he was about 2 1/2 yrs old, he calmed down a bit and was trained enough not to chew/bite/destroy anything, then we let him have free rein in the house when we left.  But we still don't leave him alone for more than 6 hours at a time."

Pets,3e2vnn,causmos,4,Tue Jul 21 15:18:30 2015 UTC,"First, check with a vet. An all-meat diet can lead to health issues such as bone density loss, kidney failure, and cardiac problems. While you're there, you can also ask the vet what they think the best method for switching food types is.   Personally, I'd go with the ""cold turkey"" method in this situation. It sounds like the dog already has loose stools, so you're not going to create this problem if you switch quickly. 99.9999% of dogs will not starve themselves, in the end. The big thing is sticking with it and making sure no one is ""supplementing"" the dog's diet with treats or raw meat, because then he'll think that if he just doesn't eat the new stuff, he'll get something he likes better/is used to (plus he won't be as hungry and the motivation to eat the kibble won't be as strong)."
Pets,3e2vnn,Marzipan86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:09 2015 UTC,"You could gradually mix in the kibble with what she is used to eating, kind of like how you would normally transition a dog from one kibble to another."
Pets,3e2vnn,leaping-elk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:27 2015 UTC,IF she has been eating an unhealthy diet you can make the kibble more appetizing by adding her favorite pieces of meat or main food substance. Do this slowly as a sudden change in food is a shock to the digestive system (imagine how upset your stomach would be it you were accustomed to eating pizza every day all day and suddenly started eating a spicy curry instead it would really upset your digestive tract for a few days and take a while to acclimate. for some this can end up being very painful and cause added stress making the transition even harder). After a few days to a week of gradually increasing the kibble and decreasing the meat in her bowl you can get to where you are just using a gravy to soak her kibble. Then every day lessen how much moisture the kibble gets. Eventually she will be eating what she should be eating.  You can also use the appropriate food as treats to get her excited about the way they taste and get her used to the crunch of them.   It is very important to watch for problems. If she is not eating or having bowel issues she needs to see a vet to ensure there isn't more going on under the surface that needs to be addressed as well as the change in diet.

Requests, however politely put, that they be considerate of others and follow the established rules when it comes to leashing, pooping, and barking, tend to be met, more often than not, with a disproportionate amount of anger and aggression toward the requestor. The attitude generally seems to be ""Me and my special snowflake here will do whatever we like, wherever we like, whenever we like"" and if you don't like it, go fuck yourself.""   There was a story in the news recently where I live about a man who allegedly doled out some vigilante justice to some dogs who killed the chickens on his property. The ""news"" story was based on nothing more a some random person's Facebook post. That was literally the only ""source"". In the comments, a woman was arguing that we don't know the facts or if the anything even happened at all, and, as such, should maybe hold off on all the torture threats against the man. A shitton of dog owners chimed in to say the most vile things toward even her, the woman simply asking people to lower their pitchforks until some facts were established. She was told to drink bleach. She was told she'd burn in hell. And on and on and on. It's was kind of frightening to see that much crazy from the dog people. But I didn't find it surprising in the least.   I've come to view dog owners as a religious cult of sorts. They have a very ""you're either with us (in thinking us and our dogs should be able to behave however we please), or you're against us"" mentality. They think they should be exempt from any questioning or criticism, and, as a result, respond to such irrationally and with anger. Frankly, they're fucking rabid, as I'm sure the reaction to this comment will demonstrate."

Pets,3e06ln,daeganthedragon,2,Tue Jul 21 16:24:53 2015 UTC,"That actually makes no sense.  Apostrophes are never used to pluralize.  Ever. So someone with English as a second language wouldn't make a mistake like that. Using an apostrophe for plurals is a common-usage mistake related to the US school system making plural-possessive more confusing than necessary and the fact that most people don't care about grammar.  Besides, the people he directs this rant at might be from a culture where letting dogs roam is ok. If he gets his rant I should get mine."
Pets,3dzpzm,pcslady,20,Mon Jul 20 21:03:48 2015 UTC,"Awww, poor guy! :(  My cats eats only wet food, but she's SUPER food motivated (I feel like food obsessed would be a better way to put it), so this happens to her occasionally.   My trick with her is to spread out the food super thin so that it covers the entire saucer and takes her three times as long to eat it. She doesn't get hiccups from eating too fast as frequently anymore either."
Pets,3dzpzm,Azumia,2,Mon Jul 20 21:48:33 2015 UTC,"I expect you can get these for cats too, i had a dog that was food obsessed like what you're talking about, we got him a bowl that had large rounded obtrusions sticking up from the floor of it, the food would go around these bumps and he would have to take his time to eat around them.  It slowed him right down and made it last longer."
Pets,3dzpzm,killit,11,Tue Jul 21 14:53:28 2015 UTC,"My older cat will do that a few times/month.  He did it last night, about half a cup of undigested food to clean up.  I find that thick, glossy junk mail is a great tool to pick up the majority of this.  Get 2 pieces and use them like a scoop on a tractor."

I have one cat that will eat canned food until it literally stuffs her. Maybe just a taste or two once in a while, instead of a whole can. And yes, I hate putting the leftover food in the fridge, even if it's in a Baggie, but a cat that loves canned food that much needs it's meals to be controlled."

Pets,3e1l5a,cornballattack,4,Tue Jul 21 06:41:20 2015 UTC,"Crate training is a great thing to do. Dogs (and their wild wolf counterparts) actually prefer having a den type area to sleep securely in. It will ensure he isn't getting into anything that could hurt him, it will teach him when it is time to sleep, and it will let you rest. It takes a bit of time. Remember if you just throw the dog in the kennel you're going to have a rough time. DO it slowly and positively reinforce that it is his space you'll find that even when the kennel door is open he will go in on his own when he's tired. The first few nights might be rough, but I promise it's a good thing. As for the barking and whining. If you start giving him attention when he does that he will continue that pattern of attention seeking behavior. He's young and not sure how to calm himself. That's something that comes with time. For now though you need to simply ignore the barking and whining. WHen he does something you prefer for your attention give it to him them, but not when he is being vocal, not even to say ""no"" or ""quiet"""
Pets,3e1l5a,goblinish,2,Tue Jul 21 11:53:09 2015 UTC,Did you try putting the kennel near your bed?
Pets,3e1l5a,DonManuel,2,Tue Jul 21 07:46:25 2015 UTC,"Try using a baby gate for your bedroom door or shut your door at night. Puppy proof the room. That way, the puppy is still in the room with you."

Pets,3e1l5a,Texyone,0,Tue Jul 21 12:34:06 2015 UTC,"Make sure to exercise him through the day and in the evening. Tired dogs are good dogs. Allow him to have a long lasting chew treat in the crate. Once you put him in completely ignore all crying/whining. This is important- only acknowledge him when he is totally calm. Wait until he relaxes and lays down. This will take time, and you will have to be very patient. Stick with it though!"
Pets,3e1l5a,MotherCybele,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:23:00 2015 UTC,"You could crate train him and keep the crate in your room if you want. Make sure you associate the crate with good things instead of punishment, though. Don't give him any attention if he barks or whines. You could invest in some toys such as kongs and fill them with treats to keep him occupied in his crate. Good luck :)"
Pets,3e0oep,chillyfeets,3,Tue Jul 21 01:32:06 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry... But why do you think he is dying? 14 is old for a cat, but he could still live a few more years. When do you go home? Can your brother take him to the vet?"
Pets,3e0oep,PrincessMau,2,Tue Jul 21 03:03:53 2015 UTC,"I tend to panic when one of my cats is sick. It could be a stomach bug or a bowel issue, but it could be something terminal. I don't know, and being so far away makes the feeling worse. I get home in 10 days. I've told my mother to take him to the vet if it continues, but that I would cover all costs if it wasn't terminal."
Pets,3e0oep,goblinish,3,Tue Jul 21 03:56:17 2015 UTC,"I would suggest asking someone in your family to take him to a vet and transfer money to them, if you can. Tell your mom you only want him put down if the vet says it is the best option. If you can cover the treatments there's not much argument for her to put him down without reason.  He needs a vet sooner rather than later. Treating something that is just becoming an issue is cheaper and more likely to work than delaying it. Even if it is terminal it is likely that the vet can manage any pain until you are able to come back and say good bye. 14 is not horribly old. It's normal to be seeing some geriatric issues. As long as you stay on top of the symptoms and treating them he could very well have quite a while longer."
Pets,3e16ws,Arteza147,9,Tue Jul 21 04:09:56 2015 UTC,"You will need to get an enzyme cleaner for the cat pee. Something like Natures Miracle.  Anything else will not actually clean the pee and there is a greater chance for your cats to continue to pee there.  The cat that is peeing should see a vet as soon as possible. Often peeing outside of the box is a sign of health issues, such as a UTI.    If it is not medical, has anything changed in their environment that could be causing stress?  Check this video out for information on what could be causing it and how to try to remedy it: http://jacksongalaxy.com/2014/08/18/cat-mojo-why-does-my-cat-pee-outside-the-litter-box/"
Pets,3e16ws,InkedVeggie,5,Tue Jul 21 06:06:40 2015 UTC,"You can try putting another litter box where the cat is peeing (after you clean it with an enzyme cleaner), and then move it inch by inch every day to a more appropriate location. Also, how many boxes do you have? It should be (number of cats)+1.  As for the human element, it sounds like there are deeper issues here. Why would your dad want to get rid of all 3 cats if just 1 is the culprit? It sounds like he needs to bond with the cats more. You could try telling him that cats may have territorial insecurities because he's so distant, and that he should spend half an hour a day playing with them with a wand toy to prevent further peeing (which may be true)."
Pets,3e16ws,valkyriav,3,Tue Jul 21 13:06:56 2015 UTC,It sounds like he needs to bond with the cats more.   It sounds like there are deeper issues going on between his mom and dad and that the reaction to the cats is really about something else in their relationship.
Pets,3e16ws,hobofats,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:34:24 2015 UTC,That too. But hopefully bonding with the cats will keep him from taking it out on them.
Pets,3e16ws,valkyriav,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:30 2015 UTC,Are they neutered? If not bring them to the Humane and have that done soon. The cleanup with Natures Miracle and putting a litter box near the site of peeing then slowly moving it to where you want to keep it can help.   Also a general rule with cats is to have 1 more litter box than the number of cats - with 3 cats have at least 4 litter boxes. Cats are territorial and maybe the one cat cannot get access to a litter box without feeling threatened.
Pets,3e16ws,julchak,0,Tue Jul 21 15:21:02 2015 UTC,It sounds like the cat might be marking her territory. Does she get along with the others ok?  Maybe you should try reintroducing them.

Pets,3dya1z,MrKatastrophe,5,Mon Jul 20 14:56:43 2015 UTC,How long have they been like this? When did they get introduced and how. You should separate them and work on reintroducing them slowly when the stress level has lowered.

Pets,3dya1z,goblinish,7,Mon Jul 20 16:58:34 2015 UTC,"It sounds like they were not introduced properly. I would suggest separating them until they calm down and doing slow introductions.  Very rarely does simply throwing cats together in a house go well. Their reintroduction needs to be slow, very slow especially given how hostile the relationship between them is now. Start by having them in separate rooms. Then let them sniff at each other through a closed door. Feed them on opposite sides of the door. Switch out bedding and blankets so they can smell each other in their safe area. Then monitor their introduction and let them interact for a few minutes. The separate them again. do this gradually and slowly over the course of a couple of weeks and their stress level and aggression should go WAY down."

Pets,3dya1z,Satan_is_OK_I_Guess,4,Tue Jul 21 00:50:04 2015 UTC,"It all depends on how you introduced them. If you just kind of threw them together, then there will usually be conflict. You need to introduce them slowly, keeping them in separate rooms. When its time to feed them, have their food near the door so they can associate their scents to something positive. There are also a lot of great videos on YouTube about this, including that Galaxy guy from Animal planet. Also, keep in mind, this could take anywhere from a few weeks to a year."
Pets,3dya1z,needsmorecoffee,2,Mon Jul 20 15:09:21 2015 UTC,"Listen to what the other posters are saying about re-introducing them. Could work! Talk to your vet. They could have ideas we won't think of here. Worst case, vets can prescribe prozac and similar drugs. When one of our cats went crazy and started trying constantly to kill her brother, I didn't want to drug her. But within 24 hours she ceased being hypervigilant, scared, and aggressive, and was back to her normal self. It was a real miracle-worker for us."

Pets,3dzym3,Azumia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:06:25 2015 UTC,Unfortunately this is a problem that will take more time to fix than the time the problem will be happening. In the meantime your best bet is to simply ignore her howling. Every time you acknowledge it it's reinforcing that is a good way to get your attention.  If you want to work on fixing it long term start by going behind a closed door for a moment at a time. When she is calm come back out and offer a favorite treat or some positive attention. Only when she is calm though. If she isn't calm come out and ignore her. DO this over and over and over and over... (you get the idea) until she is learning to be calm. This will help desensitize her to your being out of sight and she will understand you will always come back.  When she is good for those quick moments (keep it at about 30 seconds to start) increase the time to a minute.. then 2...then keep increasing until you can be out of sight for an hour or more with her being calm. Then every time you disappear she will understand that you will come back out of that door.  It's a safe bet if she is doing this when you are in the bathroom she is doing it when you leave the house as well. So this will also help with that as well. It will help her adjust and be a bit more balanced about being alone on occasion. Your cat has separation anxiety so this process will help her a lot to deal with it.
