MensRights,3e2d5e,Nick-Cage,37,Tue Jul 21 15:08:19 2015 UTC,"Its taken from an insignificantly small group of people. There are no controls.  They were chosen specifically because they are likely to demonstrate the point that the researchers were trying to make. Halo is known to attract immature males and they are likely to get angry when they lose.  The judgement of what is abuse and sexist is purely subjective. The judgement of their response to males in that situation is subjective too. If somebody loses they insult people around them. If those people are female then the insults might center around that. If they are black it might be race, or nationality, or disability. They already intend to insult someone this just shows that gender provides an obvious target.  They attempt to observe one game and extrapolate all other games and age groups from that. They also attempt to make an unqualified correlation. If a group of gamers who lose are abusive to girls, then all people who are abusive toward girls are losers in some way. There's no reference to what constitutes abusive or what loser means in this case. There's no study of comparable groups where there is competition offline. See also this.  To sum it up, this study is taking a small group of people who bitch when they lose Halo 3 matches, defining their bitching specifically as sexism and then applying it to males in general. The researchers have presented ""All men are sexist like whiny teenagers who lost their deathmatch"" as though it was science."

Trash-talk is a time-honored tradition in many games, not just video games either. You try to psych-out your opponents in order to decrease their confidence so they are more likely to fumble & lose. Suddenly your opponent is a woman and your trash-talk becomes sexist because these people believe it's not possible to be disrespectful to one woman without hating all women.  That's what really gets me about these SJW types. they are the ones who deny women agency. We want to treat women equally, that is, as one of us. That's the inclusive thing to do.

For the examination of negative statements, there were two focal players in the female-voiced manipulation that made 10 more negative statements than the next highest individuals (greater than 5 standard deviations from the mean). As a result, we removed them from our analysis to ensure they did not skew our results towards significance. Focal players stated more negative statements in the female-voiced (2.66±0.36) compared to the male-voiced manipulation (1.90±0.34, χ2 = 5.88, p = 0.0015; Table 1). The maximum skill level achieved by focal players was negatively correlated with the number of negative statements (β = -0.18, χ2 = 3.99, p = 0.046). There was also a significant interaction of the manipulation with both measures of focal player performance. Overall, there were a greater number of negative comments made by focal players in both manipulations as they died more often (i.e. their team performance decreased). However, focal players made a greater number of negative statements in the female-voiced manipulation when dying less (i.e. greater performance), and a greater number of negative statements in the male-voiced manipulation when dying extremely often (i.e. very poor performance) (β = 0.28, χ2 = 5.44, p = 0.02; Fig 3). In contrast, there was no effect of individual performance (i.e. the number of kills) on the number of negative statements made by focal players in the male-voiced manipulation, but focal players in the female-voiced manipulation stated significantly more negative statements when their performance was poor (i.e. fewer kills) and stated fewer negative statements when performing exceptionally (β = 0.35, χ2 = 6.07, p = 0.014; Fig 3).  We next examined whether the number of negative statements made by focal players was correlated with their performance metrics relative to the experimental player. Again, there was also a greater number of negative statements in the female compared to the male experimental manipulation (χ2 = 7.06, p = 0.008). There was a positive correlation between the difference in deaths and the number of negative statements (β = 0.24, χ2 = 9.43, p = 0.002) with focal players that died relatively more often than the experimental player (i.e. relatively poorer team performance) making more negative comments. There was also a negative correlation between the relative difference in kills and the number of negative statements made (β = -0.16, χ2 = 5.52, p = 0.019) such that focal players that had relatively more kills than the experimental player made fewer negative comments. There was no effect of any other factors on the number of negative statements (Table 2).    Now, where you and I may agree is that I don't think the shittalkers were necessarily misogynistic. They're going after whoever the outlier of the group is, which in this particular instance was a male player using a female voice. ""She"" wasn't targeted for being female, she was targeted for being different.  I suspect the researchers would find similar results by testing other characteristics, such as a child's voice or a speech impediment. Certain accents or speech patterns to give the impression that the speaker is not a heterosexual white male would likely also be met with hostility or harassment from the worst players."
MensRights,3e2d5e,AndaliteBandit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:28 2015 UTC,"The other factor is how do the researchers decide what is a negative statement? It's commonly observed that a statement applied to a male can be perceived as an insult when applied to a female.  But like you, my guess is that the female gamers are less common in this kind of game, so the female is perceived as an outsider to some degree. There's probably also a degree of bravado attached.  I just can't imagine the results being anything like this in a fantasy RPG based online game, or even something like GTA. This is a study of people who play Halo 3 online rather than male game players."

Here's an example. I observe apples falling from a tree. I propose this is due to a force called gravity. So I go into space with an apple tree and wait for an apple to fall, meaning I am operating with the assumption that the apple WILL fall in space. When no apples fall but instead just float in place I have failed to demonstrate that gravity is not the cause of the falling apples. This doesn't prove that gravity is the cause of the falling apples because there are other variables in my environment on earth with gravity that don't exist in space like gas, wind (movement of that gas), heat, etc. However, it lends very strong evidence that gravity is the cause of the apple falling. Further testing to remove variables like the presence of gas, the movement of that gas, the heat of the sun, etc. will further confirm the conclusion that gravity pulls the apple from the tree."

MensRights,3e2d5e,zyk0s,22,Tue Jul 21 15:09:08 2015 UTC,"Text version if you hate scrolling or are on mobile:   Alright /pol/, here is something to reinforce your opinions on women working in teams.  I am working as a team building coach in Germany. I hold courses for a company were teams are being tested and need to work together to fulfil their tasks. The goal is to have a better working team afterwards and to address problems within the team. Now before I get startet none of this is scientific. We use certain tests that need certain skills and are measured by certain factors, such as time needed, number of steps, etc. We record everything but it is not really a scientific test environment(no control groups, no randomization etc.)  To describe one particular exercise:  In a group of (usually) 16 people everyone gets blindfolded and gets an object. 4 people get the very same object. Now it is up to the people themselves to find the other 3 guys with the same object to form a group of 4 people and advance to the next excercise.  Now, the object is basically two dimensional and the key to finding your group is to count the edges. You cant see, but you can feel how many edges your object has. The perfect way would be to put a finger on one edge and then start counting the edges with your other hand until you know the number.  You can either tell everyone your method so time is not wasted(indicator of strong leadership skill) or you try to locate someone else, ask him for his number of edges and so on(poor leadership, no systematic working, you get the idea).  On saturday last week I had to finish a presentation(lll get back to that later, its the reason I post it here on /pol/) that was requested by a study group of the BMBF, the ""Bundesministerium für Familie und Forschung"", Ministry of Family and Science here in Germany). We keep track of the performance of every team and have access to quite an amount of data. The exercise described has been done 356 times and I want to talk a little about the results.  All female teams did absolutely terrible. There are only very few instances in which the women figured out to count the edges and utilized the method to achive success, let alone figured out that someone should take the lead. Even with strong female lead a lot of women were unable to figure out how to count the edges without losing count. They were just starting to count the edges without indicating where they started. There were 2 reports of women claiming to have objects with more than 20 edges while the physical maximum is nine.  There is almost no difference between all female teams and female teams with strong female leadership. Strong female leadership does increase performance but only if detailed instructions are given by the female leader. It is necessary to describe the process step by step. The best performing all female team with strong female leadership did the following:   Female leader commands everyone to be quiet several times while female are already discussing subjects not related to tasks. Female leader achieves silence, explains that you have to count the edges. She also explains the method. Female leader asks everyone to find other group members with the same number of edges. Chaos ensues. Female leader tries to get everyone to be quiet again. Female leader achieves silence and commands all with 7 edges to move towards her voice. Female leader appoints a sub leader for another number, asks group member to move towards the voice of the sub leader. Repeats the process several times until all groups are established.   Yet they are still the performing worse than mixed teams with male leader ship and a lot of mixed teams with poor male leadership. This is in stark contrast to an all male team with strong male leadership.  continued in first post ->      ->   Male leader demands silence right alter the tasks starts. There is no discussion, no period of figuring out who the leader is. Male leader says everyone should count the edges. There is no explanation of the method, yet there is no documented case in which a males failed to get the right number of edges. Male leader commands all 43 to move toward his voice, verbally appoints sub leaders for other groups while the other still move. Subleaders start to command their numbers to come close to their voice, it gets a little louder since 4 people are saying their number constantly. Groups are established.   This was the fastest documented case. Male teams with no strong leadership came in second. Someone usually yelled the method, everyone else copied it and then everyone just yelled his number until all groups were established. Mixed teams with (strong or poor) male leadership came in third, Mixed teams with strong female leadership didnt exist, it was always a male taking the lead or figuring out the method first, others copied it. Mixed teams with no leadership didnt exist either. Female teams with strong female leadership came in fourth and Female teams with no or poor leadership came in 5th by a long margin.  Now the problem lies within the results itself. They are considered sexist and discriminatory. It is not what the study group wants to hear, alter all it is for our super progressive government that sees women as superior to men and mixed teams as an ideal, which is why I was asked by my boss to make it look like mixed teams performed the best. I didnt want to fix the numbers, l just had to come up with something that made avarage results look good. So the number one indicator that determines whether it was a success or not is not the time needed, the efficency of the method or another metric. It is harmony within the group. display of natural leadership meaning no one forced someone else to listen to his opinion. Strong male leadership tended you yell out commands that addressed everybody and demanded certain actions while leadership in mixed teams usually asked politely. I also turned letting your fellow group members figure out the solution themselves, giving them time into a plus. Oh yeah, and creativity of solution, sehr wichtig.  Average became the new greatness. Mixed teams and female teams had top scores on all these feel good items, performance was ignored. lm about to hold this presentation later this week and hand over all the data. I am excited what they cook up with it but left a stinky trip mine in there. The numbers have not been changed and if they use this for any paper or recommendation in their proposals for new policies the compromising data is still in there.  So if you see someone claiming bullshit of women being superior or some shit you should take a closer look at the numbers. What was measured, how it was measured etc. lm pretty sure I am not the onyl one who riggs his data in a way that it looks better for the intended purpose."

MensRights,3e2d5e,Demonspawn,9,Tue Jul 21 16:39:57 2015 UTC,"Or maybe the point was to prove that there is a lot of people pushing the narrative that gender quotas aren't bad, that women are exactly as capable as men in all aspects of everything ever, that the only reason women don't perform well in some roles is because of oppression by men.  Just look at your comment, what you replied to, and the original one in this chain. The original comment admits that women aren't as good as men at spatial reasoning. And the next commenter takes this as fact and uses this in order to invalidate the results. What results? The post never makes a claim to any results. It says many times this is not science it is merely saying that for this task, all male groups with male leaders performed best.  So this commenter, /u/Azothlike, is already presupposing a statement that is not in the post, which is that men are better leaders and better at cooperation.  And is using a statement that men are better at spatial reasoning to dismiss this conclusion which was never stated in the first place.  And now you are commenting saying that this post is to ""reaffirm ones preconceived notions about gender."" What preconceived notions? No statement of gender superiority was made. The OP never said men are better leaders than women. It merely provided data that may or may not be true. But this data isn't the focus of the conclusion which is that people should observe more closely the data from so-called studies that conclude one gender is better than the other.  So what preconceived notion about gender was preached? If the genders were reversed in the data would you be saying this? The moral of the story would still be the same. That studies about gender are heavily biased and often people whose interests aren't the truth will alter data the best they can to tell the narrative they want to tell rather than the truth. Like how the CDC numbers on rape didn't include ""made to penetrate"" as rape even though a woman sticking a gun to my head and making me fuck her is most certainly rape. This kind of manipulation happens and is done for people to be able to tell a narrative that is false. Like that women get raped 10 times as much as men, which if you include ""made to penetrate"" is a blatant lie provable by just using the numbers in that same report."

When others can't repeat your findings using your process, explain that ""it's complicated"".   I've seen this done in hard science. The ridiculous weight placed on publishing, and the way this affects grant allocation, compels researchers to either kinda-sorta fudge their results, ignore relevant data, or seek low-hanging fruit (""adjusting this process at this stage by 150% generates a 1.2% increase in throughput"").   I've read peer reviewed papers on using MgO nanoparticles as biological weapons neutralizing agents. The paper claimed this was a breakthrough, as MgO is a benign compound that doesn't harm organisms and is therefore environmentally safe. Well, yeah, in its bulk form it's benign. In its nanoparticulate form, it operates like asbestos, its rough, spiky edges mechanically tearing bacteria cells apart, and even demolishing the protein coats of viruses. How can a substance that rips apart cell walls and the protective shells of viruses be ""benign"" to organisms? Of course, some months after I read this paper and spotted this contradiction, I stumbled across a small story in the newspaper about suspicions that nanoparticles used in odor-absorbing socks were destroying soil bacteria.

Even though the end warns to examine data, it specifies that you should only really check on the data if it makes the ""bullshit"" claim that women could do better than men in any subject, with no such warning to look at the numbers if men do better than women in anything.  The post doesn't flat out state ""men are better than women"", but it is pretty overt that the theme of the post is the superiority of men, espically since the post begins with ""here is something to reinforce your opinion on women working in teams"", posted to an obviously sexist board.

Saying I am better than a woman at math does not mean I believe all men are better than all women at math. You get this right? Because you're a reasonable person I assume.

Think of it this way, is it okay for someone to say ""women are better care takers than men.""? Even if it may be true, and I have no idea if it is, it's not good to say because it discourages men raising children, and reinforces gender roles. Likewise, saying that men are better at leading, and reasoning, even if supported by numbers, isn't good to do because it reinforces the gender roles society places on men and women."

Saying that all men are on average stronger than women is not a problem, it's a fact. What problem is there saying that one gender is better on average than the other gender. Guess what, genders ARE different despite what some people will tell you.   ""women are better care takers than men.""? If you gave me objective measures for good care taking that most people could agree with and then could prove that women perform better on those tasks with objective data (Note: not surveys of opinion) I would have no problem with you saying that women are on average better caretakers.    Making that comparison to the potentially untrue one of this post is like comparing apples and oranges. The task displayed in the post has quantifiable measures of success. Speed of completion is measurable and objective. time doesn't give a shit if you're a man or woman.  .  Also, you say stuff like ""it reinforces gender roles"" as if this is a bad thing. People who are more suited to a task should be more often than not the one performing that task. Like in all free societies roles exist but are not enforced. Men are better firefighters due to their physical attributes but if a woman can perform the same required physical tasks, then they are allowed to be firefighters despite the role being typically performed by a man.   To claim something is bad because it reinforces something that you haven't proven is bad is a shit argument. A gender role discouraging someone from doing something isn't objectively bad in all cases. Women SHOULD be discouraged from being soldiers because very few of them have the dedication and drive to meet the same physical standards as men (i.e the standards required for their duties) because it's harder for them to do so. Men SHOULD be discouraged from being gymnasts because they lack the inherent flexibility required of many gymnastic tasks. This makes it much harder for them to perform the same gymnastic tasks.  Discouragement is not the same as denial. People who truly want to do something should not allow discouragement prevent them from doing so. And in a free society it doesn't."

MensRights,3e2d5e,paragonofcynicism,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:10:09 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, finally my chance to share my experience.  A few years ago, I went to a tourist camp. 95% of the people in the camp were from the best national schools in my country. Every person was smart and if he wasn't, he still was nice and a person who still knows how to do stuff. We were teens. There were more girls and girls were even smarter than boys, actually.  However, one of the things we did was go out in the forest for 24 hours so the instructor would show us what to do in such survival situations.  The first thing he told us to do once we found a good place to camp was to make a shelter. Since we were still kinda kids, he gaves us a few axes to work with. He told us what to do. We went out and did it. Guys not talking a lot. Just doing what we have to. Girls start asking questions, le suggesting what to do better, etc., etc. Bitches, our instructor is a geography teacher and a national park ranger and survival enthusiast, pretty sure he knows better than some whiny 15 year olds. The same instructor was happy we had some guys in our group cuz the girls always bitch about chopping trees, etc.  Another task what to do was to ""Baptise"" the newcomers of the camp. It's a tradition in Eastern European countries to ""Baptise"" the newcomers. High school freshmen, Uni freshmen, camp newcomers, etc. By ""Baptising"" I mean making them suffer with eggs, mud, pain and cold.  We had two days to come up with the thematics, original tasks and execute them.  Every time we, seniors, sit down to think what we are going to do. Every time we do, girls start bantering. This happened like 5 times. Then I came up with the thematic, told everyone separarely, everyone said it was cool.  Once the time started pushing us, girls cooperate and we come up with all the tasks. Everyone's on board.  The next day, we start preparing. Girls thinking the oath and ""quizes"", guys digging mud baths and such.  The digging spot was like 2 minutes from our camp, so the digging guys didn't know what the girls were doing. I go to check out how it's going for my friends.   ""Have you finished the oath?""  ""Almost.""  ""Quizes?""  ""The first one yes, the second one kinda""  So as I understood, all camp girls divided, minding their things, chilling and talking, while the work is not done with a few hours left.  Remember the digging thingie? Turns out it was harder than we thought. We digged for 3 hours, some less because needed to rest, but me and my friend were working overtime compared to how many boys there were. Ever digged in a forest? Grass is hard to dig through and all the grass and all the tree roots that have to be chopped off so the newcomers don't get hurt while sliding through 'em.  Once we finish our work, all exhausted, 1 hour until the event, girls, who didn't dig shit, start talking that something is wrong, something's lacking, giving suggestions n shit.  And after I calm them down, they are all talking like they arranged everything and did the most work. Not saying girls should've digged, but they should've at least thanked us for what we did and be thankful, instead they acted like it was our duty to do it.  To conclude/TL;DR:   Girls, instead of doing what they have to, try to suggest everything they come up with. Even when the work is done, they somehow decide to 'fix' it, being unhelpful as hell. They better talk about how much they did instead of actually doing more, esp. at the work breaks."

The issue is not just Men being affected but all none female victims, where the victimisation is seen as primarily due to anything other than female status!

Then the overwhelming sorrow they feel for the abuser clouds their ability to feel any pity for the victim.  It doesn't matter if the victim kills himself as a result of the abuse (happened with a 15 year old boy, she got less than 2 months in prison), or draws into a depression and starts to self harm (happened with a 12 year old boy, she only got a few years), or anything. All of that seems to be forgotten as soon as they see a woman with a sob story, and then their goal becomes to let her off as easy as they feel they can get away with.

How do you propose ending a human being's life for doing that? It's functionally the same as giving someone life imprisonment for helping an old lady across the road. It's unprofessional at worst. With women, it's a different attitude, but only because women are pressured and indoctrinated into perceiving themselves as victims after the fact in such situations. Tell a woman she's a victim and is supposed to be ""scarred"" because an older guy she was totally into had consensual sex with her, and don't be surprised when they later adapt that attitude.

Think of it like a dietary coach at Jenny Craig, checking in occasionally to make sure you're progressing, but not too much so that you stop subscribing.  She's trying to link the lack of catcalls as a sign that their agenda is working, rather than conceding that it wasn't a major problem that affects a majority of women on a regular basis. She goes on to essentially say that, while (in her view) their activism has lead to less catcalling, they must stay vigilant to keep it from creeping back as a social norm.  This is, in my opinion, textbook opinion piece formatting. She hooks readers in by conceding that catcalls are a non-issue, and then shocks the reader with grave news that, upon closer inspection, it's still a perverse cancer gnawing at the foundation of the house that Patriarchy built.

No, she's a sinner and needs to pray harder and donate to the church more often. Your doubt is just more evidence of your sin. Praise jeebus!  Sorry, I got distracted there.

But this poses a problem, because the men whose catcalls are unappreciated are going to be overwhelmingly low-status, but masculine men, of african-american or hispanic ethnicity.

Campaigning against this on the internet will not be effective because I can assure you they don't use the internet much, or at least nothing outside facebook.

Virtually everyone else saw it a couple of times a year, at best, or even more rarely.  So, when you factor in that this is just those that experienced it in the first place (65%) and the graph utterly leaves out those that experienced literally none (35%), you can see we're talking about 6% of 65% ... or 3.9% of the overall population see this regularly. the other 96.1% sees it never, once or rarely.

I'm so used to the idea that all women are sexually harassed that not getting sexually harassed seems to imply that I don't ""pass"" or don't ""count"" (trans person here)*. Does that mean I want to be sexually harassed? Hell, no!   Basically - I think - she's just saying she shouldn't be so needy for male approval. She blames that on the same cultural mindset that leads to the catcalling itself. I'm not a fan of Valenti's, but it's not a total contradiction, is it?   (*Admittedly, I'm like way over 30.

MensRights,3dy65o,Maschalismos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:27:46 2015 UTC,"I'd say parts of culture/society are indeed suggesting that women's value lies to a good degree in beauty   I understand how it must seem that way but it's actually the other way round. Culture doesn't generally suggest anything, it follows patterns that existed before. At the most, culture might reinforce what was already there or maintain it beyond the time it was useful.    Jessica Valenti seems to be very susceptible to social pressure   Well, I'm not sure if it's not just a selling act. She's speaking for her readers and catering to those who feel that way. Think of people like her like an ad spokesperson. They're paid to say what they say so we have no way of relying on how they really feel.   There clearly is pressure on both sexes, but isn't symmetrical by a long shot. The demands made on men are often contradictory. It's literally impossible for a man to be what most people expect of him. Also it's far less forgiving. Women can of course fail to meet the ideal beauty standards but the consequences are almost never going to be that they're dehumanized for it (i.e. ""you're not a real woman, real women wear makeup""). And for every quirk that a woman may have, there's an entire subculture of men who are turned on by it. That's not true the other way round."

I realize the most properly-feminist response to all of this would be to proudly declare that I don’t care, that being too old to catcall is glorious freedom. But that would be a lie. I do care in some way that sits uncomfortably with my politics   She is describing how her feelings, which she attributes to the environment she grew up in, aren't matching up with her beliefs. At no point is she saying men should be catcalling her.  Honestly, it's not like reconciling desires/feelings with conflicting beliefs and our identity is a novel concept. Something that's probably along the lines of this writer: we've all had that shitty relationship that we knew was bad for us, but, even after getting out, part of us still misses it and we feel gross for that.  What she probably is doing wrong is blaming it all on, ""our culture."" At least, that's what her first title had.   I know that my reaction is normal, considering the culture I’ve grown up in, as much as I know that my self worth does not depend on what strangers think.   It's not, ""our culture,"" doing this; it's the natural desire to feel desired. Maybe you can blame how you grew up for catcalls and beauty/aging standards being an internalized metric for attractiveness, but it's not just culture that creates a human social need to be validated as a desirable individual."

The reason you blame society is because you don't to admit that you miss it. Because Cat-calling can only be bad in your mind, but it isn't. It is obnoxious and stupid and embarrassing for some people to be cat-called.  It also has a positive side, it provides tangible proof of your attractiveness. If you get cat-called 5 times a week, then no one can call you ugly, because you're so attractive that men will look like assholes on the street just to tell you you're attractive. You know that you could have a one night stand if you want to, because you keep hearing from randoms about it.  The problem hear is, you are like a spoiled kid. The kid wants presents at his brother's birthday, and his parents give him one of his brother's toys instead of telling you, ""no, this is your brother's birthday and those are his toys not yours."" You want the public fountain all to yourself and instead of telling you that public property is for the public, they tell you that ""society is mean and won't let you take it home"".  In your case, you feel disgusted at cat calling and instead of questioning your emotions, you start with the assumption that you're right and then say that those men are horrible and that you don't have to empathise with them because they probably have bad intentions. And when you miss having your sexual attractiveness verified, instead of reflecting on what is likely hypocrisy and developing a nuanced position, you say it is societies fault that you feel a certain way, even though you are a grown feminist who should be able to see through this bullshit.  To be clear, there are feminists who have self awareness, but feminism provides a way for people without self awareness to ever reflect on themselves.  Also, who the fuck was cat-calling Valenti? Did all her cat-calls come from behind, before they saw her face?"
MensRights,3dy65o,fromhitobye,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:10:02 2015 UTC,"To my great shame, I assume I must look particularly good on the rarer days that I do get catcalled.   Man-hatred is really bad for these bigots' mental health.  They live out their lives with the assumption that male sexuality is evil even as they bask in attention that they end up longing for in their old-lady years.  We should watch for these mentally-crippled feminist cultists, as they are the ones who will end up raping little boys or aiding convicted murderers escape prison.   Being harassed on the street is not a compliment, and it surely has never felt like one. For most, if not all women, it can be scary and sometimes dangerous to deal with   Until it stops and you miss it, right, Valenti?  'Round and round the hamster wheel goes.   She claims that she wishes there was more nuance in the 'conversation' (feminist echo-chamber), but she certainly doesn't want to start out by differentiating between mentally ill people who masturbate in front of children and guys who compliment a lady on her good looks.     even as a seasoned feminist - sexism is a powerful enough force to still reside my head   Like all feminists in all circumstances, her logic boils down to wanting to have her cake and eating it too.  She wants to age into an undesirable old man-hating hag while still keeping all the positive male attention that her ego thrived on in her younger, slightly-less-repulsive years.  I suppose this is solace to us MRAs.  Feminism is a malady of a woman's youth that turns into haunting, lonely desperation as they age.  I feel really bad for her daughter.  But it could be worse, she could have had a son like Julie Bindel."

Only when it comes to being an actual criminal case (not that a restraining order doesn't often have the same effect) is a lawyer necessary for the accuser and they already have one - it's called the prosecutor.

Of course, all of which are false.  As for the subject matter itself, Richard Dawkins came around to accept open relationship after being with a woman who changed his perspective. But, it is nothing like what is described here. It's so when they are apart due to their busy lives, they can find companionships free of guilt while understanding, without jealousy, the other is doing just the same. It's not for me, but Richard Dawkins made a good case for it. I'm paraphrasing it, so obviously it's not going to be as persuasive."

MensRights,3e0jqj,Il128,8,Tue Jul 21 12:39:44 2015 UTC,"Jesus, this is textbook psychological abuse.   It wasn’t until my wife mentioned one evening that she’d kissed another man and liked it and wanted to do more than kiss next time[...]   Okay, so before an open relationship has been agreed she's already kissing another guy and has told her husband she want to fuck said guy: great start.   She knew how deep our love was, and knew that her wanting a variety of sexual experiences as we traveled through life together would not diminish or disrupt that love. It took me about six months — many long, intense conversations, and an ocean of red wine — before I knew it, too.   Six months, alcohol, and the knowledge that the wife already has at least one other guy lined up who she may or may not have already taken the liberty of screwing during the 6 months it took him to agree to her demands. I'm skeptical that a someone in a mono relationship who has met someone else they want to have sex with and decided they want their relationship to suddenly become poly because it's now convenient for them would have the patience to wait 6 months for the thumbs up from their partner, but maybe I'm just cynical. I'm sure the fear of divorce and the possibility of losing his kids should he not accept her terms played no part in his decision whatsoever!   It does work both ways and, yes, I too enjoy sexual carte blanche. I just don’t use mine as much as my wife uses hers.   Of course he doesn't, otherwise it would have been a fairly quick, happy, mutual agreement between him and his wife, rather than the reality of ""I've kissed and want to bang other guys, let me do it or else."" and him painstakingly taking the only option that won't immediately result in a divorce.    There are of course moments of jealousy, resentment, and insecurity.    But I thought this was an open and honest agreement founded on love, trust and commitment to each other? Surely if they're both happy with this arrangement then those negative feelings should be virtually off the radar? After all, the hookups don't really mean anything and she wouldn't leave him for one of them.  Unless of course he's extremely uncomfortable with being forced into an open relationship and doesn't believe that his wife would never consider leaving him for one of her lovers... perish the thought right?   I don’t want her to fall in love with anyone else, and every time she goes on a date, I confront the possibility that she might. It happened at the beginning: The first person she dated after we opened up fell hard in love with her, and my wife, overwhelmed by his ardor, tried to love him back. Watching it happen, I was confused, angry, and terrified that she wanted to leave me. She assured me she didn’t, and whatever feelings she had for him didn’t lessen what she felt for me. Believing her then was the ultimate trust exercise. We survived because eventually I did believe her, and also because I learned to trust myself.   I've been quite scathing in replying to previous quotes from the article but I can't actually continue in the same vein here because this is so depressing to read. On her first date, she's fallen in love with one of her flings, in his own words, and when he's inevitably distraught by this, rather than addressing his concern by severing contact with the other guy, she basically tells him to deal with it. His options remain: give in to her demands, or divorce and hope he gets to see his kids once a week.   My open marriage has made heavy demands on my ability to silence the voice of doubt in my head, that gnawing feeling of worthlessness.   That voice is telling you you're being emotionally abused, and forced to accept a relationship dynamic that makes you feel insecure and worthless.    This guy is so afraid of losing his wife and children that he will rationalise their relationship as mature and trusting, when the stark reality is that she can do whatever she wants with whoever she wants and his feelings are not considered, he just has to 'trust her'. I think deep down he knows that it's just a matter of time before she finds husband 2.0 and leaves him. Don't get me wrong, I'm absolutely certain that poly relationships can and do flourish, but any 'poly' relationship that begins in the way that this one has is basically one partner saying to the other ""I'm going to cheat, either accept that or we're getting divorced""."
