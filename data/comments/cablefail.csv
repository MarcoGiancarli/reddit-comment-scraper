cablefail,3duc9g,step_x_step,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:14:43 2015 UTC,The other captures the light nicely....
cablefail,3duc9g,step_x_step,2,Mon Jul 20 01:16:15 2015 UTC,This is a pretty decent pic for OP taking it with their camera held in their teeth.
cablefail,3duc9g,derkirche,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:58:05 2015 UTC,Never allowed for that. Extra bucket list item: Steady Cam lessons
cablefail,3duc9g,step_x_step,6,Tue Jul 21 02:58:35 2015 UTC,i'm not sure if i want to know why the gloves are that color...
cablefail,3duc9g,Drak3,3,Sun Jul 19 21:42:43 2015 UTC,Looks like soot as if the black we see on wires is soot from a fire.
cablefail,3duc9g,XCorneliusX,3,Sun Jul 19 22:58:52 2015 UTC,Its a mixture of oil and iron dust. I can tell you its not one of the work i love :)
cablefail,3duc9g,Streichholz1600,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:14:58 2015 UTC,both of those are a lot better than what I was hoping it wasn't.

cablefail,3dowe6,step_x_step,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:12:15 2015 UTC,"I should have been clearer. Regular dual socket phenolic outlets set in steel case power bars, like Hammond or Panduit, or probably others whose name I don't know."

cablefail,3dlrcf,ITpuzzlejunkie,2,Fri Jul 17 14:37:26 2015 UTC,Is this the switch from Solid Phase to Gas Phase?
cablefail,3dlrcf,IAmSnort,2,Fri Jul 17 16:36:37 2015 UTC,What gauge is the wire on the left?
cablefail,3dlrcf,FishPumpkin,3,Fri Jul 17 17:25:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know the american standard but in EU it's 2.5mm2 (max. 21A), so probably 12 gauges."

cablefail,3dfzww,cokert,2,Thu Jul 16 15:08:29 2015 UTC,Any idea what it is for?
cablefail,3dfzww,starscreamsghost17,3,Thu Jul 16 00:45:02 2015 UTC,Gotta shorten my run.
cablefail,3dfzww,xDrive4MaticQuattro,2,Thu Jul 16 10:59:25 2015 UTC,No idea what it was for. It didn't go to anything on the other side of the wall.

cablefail,3d9yod,Cameroo,3,Tue Jul 14 19:01:59 2015 UTC,Its okay just wait for the tooless PCPs!
cablefail,3d9yod,si1entdave,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:34:40 2015 UTC,I'll believe it when I see it. I have no doubt that new cabs that get put in will be the tooless ones. But I can't see them replacing all the old cabs any time soon
cablefail,3d9yod,vzzzbux,12,Wed Jul 15 07:55:49 2015 UTC,"Ah, the joys of British Telecom (as was). I work with BT guys regularly, and every time, I find that the planners are muppets, and the engineers on the ground are helpful, friendly, skilled people.  Just don't talk to me about the eejits from Kelly Communications and MJ Quinn..."
cablefail,3d9yod,vzzzbux,10,Tue Jul 14 19:40:33 2015 UTC,"Dont get me started about kellys and MJ. They are the bane of my exsistence. Always running around after them fixing their fuckups.   And yeah, the planners are absolutly fucking retarded sometimes. ""lets cross the road here, go down the street 100m the cross the road then come back the direction it just came from on the road it started on"" seriously. WTF!"
cablefail,3d9yod,vzzzbux,2,Tue Jul 14 20:14:44 2015 UTC,"I dislike their attitude to what areas get FTTC and which get FTTP.  It seems like they just flip a coin. They spare no expense in pulling fibre for FTTP to rural farmhouses in the middle of nowhere, but areas like mine that are slightly built up get FTTC (and the next street, FTTP, even though it would have no hurdles that I can see to stop it getting FTTC too). I've seen FTTP for two poles in the middle of the street and places where one half is on FTTP and the other FTTC.  I guess it's to do with the boundaries of areas served by cabinets but they could be more consistent"
cablefail,3d9yod,noobc0mbo,3,Wed Jul 15 08:05:45 2015 UTC,Most http circuits are private lines. Meaning they paid up to 4 figures to get that circuit. Anyone in an fttc enabled area can pay to get fttc. But u have to pay a lot.
cablefail,3d9yod,ttelec,2,Wed Jul 15 08:58:47 2015 UTC,"Nah this is consumer grade fttp, as in BT infinity, and the same installation and monthly costs except you can pay more and get 330Mbit if you want (like £60 a month I think). It's not fttp on demand with the hilarious prices   If you typed the phone number into a checker it would say you can get FTTP instead if FTTC  I live in Cornwall, we seem to have almost all of the FTTP BT has installed nationwide."
cablefail,3d9yod,bg-j38,2,Wed Jul 15 09:10:23 2015 UTC,Ah. Yeah Cornwall is our testing ground. That's why it's so random. We pick specific circumstances and area to test the methods to provide it and how well they perform. The decisions in Cornwall are chosen specifically to test a certain way.
cablefail,3d9yod,Nu11u5,3,Wed Jul 15 09:19:43 2015 UTC,"I recently had to deal with a business moving premises. Both are within a few hundred yards of each other and are on the same cabinet.  For some reason BT wanted to go through some lengthy process where they put in a totally new phone line with new number, then move the old number over eventually and install broadband some time later.  The genuine openreach tech (with my permission) just installed the line up to the cabinet as planned and simply patched the old line to it - simpler and meant the broadband worked immediately too"
cablefail,3d9yod,Chesterdog123,7,Wed Jul 15 08:10:28 2015 UTC,Get your toner ready.
cablefail,3d9yod,Cameroo,9,Tue Jul 14 19:57:47 2015 UTC,"life savers them things. This is actually a pretty tidy cab. ""Midlands"" cabs are the worst. When u open one of those then the toners are your only hope."
cablefail,3d9yod,Chesterdog123,5,Tue Jul 14 20:16:24 2015 UTC,"Boss, I'm afraid I just broke all of my fingers. You'll have to appoint someone else to this. I'm so sorry."

cablefail,3d9yod,h0uz3_,3,Wed Jul 15 03:59:39 2015 UTC,As A CP who works with all areas of BT daily I just want to say a huge thanks to you OR guys in the ground. You (mostly) do am amazing job under difficult circumstances!   Planners (especially EAD planners!) are complete tools and don't understand that you can't tell your customer to wait 6 months whilst they apply for PTD or wayleave!   So yeah - top job boys and girls. Keep it up!
cablefail,3d9yod,Bobby_D84,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:00:37 2015 UTC,You should start to see a change in the planners over the next few months...

cablefail,3d9yod,nerddtvg,4,Tue Jul 14 22:02:43 2015 UTC,"I call'em cherries, since the genuine ones have that red button on them. You get into a SLC like the pic that OP posted, it looks like a cherry tree.  Besides, you get to pop them by crimping them onto the wires, heh!"

cablefail,3d9yod,Glockshna,4,Tue Jul 14 21:51:34 2015 UTC,Put a signal generator into the customer's outlet and see where the signal can be received.
cablefail,3d9yod,CyFus,4,Tue Jul 14 22:02:04 2015 UTC,And pray
cablefail,3d9yod,pipiopi,4,Tue Jul 14 22:47:04 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, there is some order to that madness every pair is number in 100 pair ""verts"" and every line is assosicated with a in and out allocation with a blue and yellow jumper between them. So 9/10 times as long as you are careful u can count the pairs on the verts without the need of a toner."

cablefail,3d9yod,snatchington,3,Wed Jul 15 00:41:42 2015 UTC,? 90% of BT's PCP's are like this... this is no way is a bad one
cablefail,3d9yod,Mazo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:07:43 2015 UTC,"Well, the good news is Verizon refuses to maintain this stuff any more, so it won't be around too much longer.   Or until they find a sucker another corporation to buy the infrastructure from them."

cablefail,3d9k09,skcorronoc,10,Tue Jul 14 15:47:29 2015 UTC,That is an impressively large number of concurrent code violations.
cablefail,3d9k09,gxti,5,Tue Jul 14 16:31:39 2015 UTC,"Where I am, it is actually against code to have anything tied off to the sprinkler system (even if it isn't being supported and is just there for ease of running)."
cablefail,3d9k09,DanSheps,5,Tue Jul 14 16:31:25 2015 UTC,It is where OP works too. We're on the same crew.
cablefail,3d9k09,ZarquonsFlatTire,2,Tue Jul 14 20:17:42 2015 UTC,"What i was told when i asked was that hospitals started having problems with the weight of wire bundles, resting on the sprinkler system, some how causing the system to fail. I have not tried to fact check this. It sounded reasonable enough to satisfy me."
cablefail,3d9k09,DanSheps,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:10:42 2015 UTC,It is actually code here.  Nothing can be tied off to the sprinkler system
cablefail,3d9k09,GayManLoveIsOK,5,Wed Jul 15 21:40:58 2015 UTC,is this a new sprinkler system where they feed 277 Volts into the water as it shoots out to electrify the fire? must be one of them new fangled systems...
cablefail,3d9k09,Anarchkitty,3,Tue Jul 14 18:25:02 2015 UTC,"On the one hand: OMFG! Code violations!  On the other hand, the cable supporting the conduit is obviously cut off at both ends and is just serving the same purpose as rope or zip ties.  It's wrong, but not necessarily stupid."
