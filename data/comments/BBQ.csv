Smoked over hickory and lump on my Akorn at 225-245 until they reached an internal temp of about 195 at the thickest part (somewhere around 4-5 hours).   They came out extraordinary, like brisket on a stick. It was fun showing them off to neighbors and such who had never seen a ""Texas long rib"" as the butcher called it.

BBQ,3e08zi,pauljordan92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:26:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, up to around 14lbs, though it'll definitely be a tight squeeze. Also, because briskets are pretty flat slabs of meat, you can usually fit a slightly oversized one without too much difficulty. The ends will just be curved until the fat starts melting, then it flattens back out.  If you do brisket often, I'd recommend A) getting a 22.5"" grate cooker, and B) consider an actual WSM. That being said, brisket is well-suited for hot-n-fast so you may be fine."
BBQ,3e08zi,msudawgs55,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:30:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! Seems like I'll be off to smoke some brisket soon.  Does anyone have some tips for cooking on a kettle grill?  Cheers!!
BBQ,3e08zi,msudawgs55,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:33:44 2015 UTC,"You're gonna wanna use the fuse method. Google it.  Also, you're gonna be looking to maintain a temp anywhere from 250-300F."
BBQ,3e08zi,jj_ped,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:49:50 2015 UTC,How's the snake method enough time for a brisket? I can only get 4-5 hours out of my snake. Maybe you do one that goes 360. I only do one halfway because the meat gets burned a bit.
BBQ,3e08zi,msudawgs55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:31:04 2015 UTC,"I don't cook on kettles, i use a WSM or a pellet pooper.  Can't help you with alternatives to snake method. You're not exactly working with a ton of room in that thing in order to minimize # of coals burning at once while also maintaining indirect heat.  I think the idea with the snake is that you eventually extend the snake and wrap back around, over and over again. You of course will have to take the top and grate off to do this. Welcome to smoking on a kettle."
BBQ,3e08zi,jj_ped,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:47:13 2015 UTC,"Glad you clarified. OP is on a kettle and personally, is a bitch to cook brisket on. WSM all the way. I just got one."
BBQ,3e08zi,LaTuFu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:58:08 2015 UTC,"The 18.5 is a pretty small kettle to do smokes with, especially for something the size of a brisket.  You can do it, it'll just be more labor intensive because you'll have to add charcoal more often.  Nothing wrong with doing it a few times to decide if it is something you enjoy, however.  Like others have said, if you decide you're in, a dedicated WSM may be the way to go.  An alternative I'll throw out is the 26 Kettle.  You'll have plenty of room for a brisket on there, as well as more than enough room for a long burning fuse.  It's a reasonable option to consider if you're cooking for 2-4 people most of the time.  If you're smoking larger quantities or for groups, the WSM is pretty tough to beat."
BBQ,3e08zi,LaTuFu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:40 2015 UTC,"I really can't afford any of that, so this is my only option. Thanks for the tip on the charcoal, I'll be babysitting that brisket though but who cares.  Cheers!"
BBQ,3e08zi,smokeymick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:30:05 2015 UTC,"No worries, then.  If it is what you've got to work with, and will be for the foreseeable future, it can work just fine.  Just learn the limits of your equipment, and you can master the techniques required to take advantage of it.  All you really need is a decent digital thermometer, a stick is fine, a dual probe like the Maverick ET-733 is better if your budget allows for it.    After that, just learn how to keep consistent temp on your kettle with a fuse or other indirect method and you're fine."

The smell goes throughout the house and they get their plates ready when it goes to rest, by the time I cut or pull they are standing there just taking it off the plate as I slice it. Very few people I have over sauce any more or even sit down, they just crowd around the kitchen and dining area and steal meat as it comes off. Unless I way cook way too much, I have to eat while pulling (which is never a problem) or I don't eat.  Edit: phrasing"

BBQ,3dzk1e,teach_me_how_to_data,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:43:20 2015 UTC,Thanks. Would be interesting to know if he brined it actually.
BBQ,3dzk1e,teach_me_how_to_data,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:45:43 2015 UTC,Could help w/ the color. Or the smoke wood. Seems to penetrate poultry more.  Also look into spatchcocking. Great way to do birds. Or dry brines vs wet brines. Most stuff in brines is way overkill.
BBQ,3dzk1e,d_valle_,2,Mon Jul 20 20:52:32 2015 UTC,"As others have said, I'm thinking the pink color is from a ""smoke ring"" on the chicken from low and slow.   It seems that charcoal smoke helps get a nice char on the skin, even at lower than usual temperatures. I would think some of the blackening can also come from the rub/seasoning used."
BBQ,3dzk1e,LaTuFu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:17:44 2015 UTC,"My guess is he was cooking slow and smoking to a degree.  Chicken usually only gets pink if it is smoked somewhat.  Spatchcock and cook over low heat, 250-275 is where I would try it.  Once it gets to the temp you want internally, raise the heat and sear the skin until its crispy.  If you want to cook faster, or don't want to be as involved in the process, the 300-350 range will cook it quicker, but I don't think you'll get as much color out of it.  The lower heat will allow more time for smoke penetration without drying out the chicken."
BBQ,3dzk1e,BuddhaRocks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:03:32 2015 UTC,You could be right about the chicken itself - try organic and see if it comes out any better.  Another thought: Grandpa may have brined the chicken overnight before cooking it.
BBQ,3dxzk1,Advicify,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:31:29 2015 UTC,I am looking at the Kamado Joe... Price seems to be pretty big difference...
BBQ,3dxzk1,savrox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:51 2015 UTC,I have a Kamado Joe classic.  It's one of my most prized possessions.  I like the build quality of the grill and it does come with more accessories than the equivalent green egg.  My only gripe is that when I lift the lid the daisy wheel moves and I have to reset it.  It's a minor gripe and may be easily remedied but it hasn't bothered me enough to research yet.  There are a few videos on the Joe Junior in the official Kamado Joe cooking channel.  John covers how to setup the grill for all of his recipes.    https://youtu.be/I16KuD7dwDI
BBQ,3dxzk1,thestatic1982,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:12 2015 UTC,Many thanks. I noticed that it has more accessories at a lower price. I assume they are practically identical in terms of cooking capability?
BBQ,3dxzk1,thestatic1982,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:57:35 2015 UTC,I haven't used a BGE but it seems to be the general consensus and I don't have any reason to doubt it.  A lot of the aftermarket accessories can work on either kamado joe or BGE.  I really love my grill man.  I think the pulled pork I've made is  consistently as good as anything I've had at a restaurant.  It's a versatile tool.  I've made a BBQ chicken pizza and really enjoyed that too.  If you aren't familiar with char coal it can take a little while before you get really comfortable with set it and forgot it low and slow cooking.  You do need to get the char coal placed in a fashion that you don't cover up the vents.  That part can be a pain but it is a rewarding experience.
BBQ,3dxxy4,cmcgalliard,3,Mon Jul 20 13:16:39 2015 UTC,"I haven't used butcher paper yet, bit if that is the only thing you've changed I would suspect that might have something to do with it.

BBQ,3dxxy4,stugatz21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:34 2015 UTC,"Sounds like if you want them ""fall off the bone"" and consider cutting with a knife a bad thing (technically ""correct"" ribs are cut with a knife actually - clean pull/bike mark to the bone tender but dont fall off bone under their own weight) you just prefer ribs that are more on the overcooked side of things.  3-2-1 is usually a little too heavy duty for baby backs since they're smaller, but I'd say start there and adjust as needed. Overcooking moves towards the mush spectrum on ribs, not the shoe leather spectrum.  How big are the racks? What temp? What did you put in with the foil? Are you spraying them while they cook or peeking a lot?  I don't mean to insult you by saying ""overcooked"", by the way...a lot of people like them like that, but it might be helpful to categorize if you're trying to search and troubleshoot. Might look into the bend test too, seems to be the best rib done-ness test IMO. Bend test them, when they're ""ready"" per the bend test, just cook em more for your preference."

This weekend, i HAD to use a knife.  i couldn't get the bone out easily. I definitely like my ribs more tender though :)       Overcooking moves towards the mush spectrum on ribs, not the shoe leather spectrum.    this is good to know thanks!"

Now, Im trying to convert some more standard grill recipes that I've saved over to the pellet grill style, and have a few questions:  Here is the recipe I'm trying to convert  My two questions are:  Can I drop the temperature of this chicken down to 225 or so and run it low and slow for longer than the hour the recipe here lists  For recipes like this with an asian flare, does adding a smoked taste potentially clash with herbs and spices that the recipe calls for?"
BBQ,3dvyvk,Coffman34,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:38:10 2015 UTC,"I am not sure about the flavor. But as far as the time, you should always be cooking to temp not to time. 165 is the target temp for chicken.  Keep in mind that the skin, if left on, will have a rubber texture unless it is crisped at the end. That can be done by throwing it on the grill for 2-3 minutes on high heat."
BBQ,3dvyvk,kenyabob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:27 2015 UTC,"Great. My understanding is the lower the temperature, the less dried out the chicken will be, and the more smokey it will be too.

Basically you fill a hopper with hardwood pellets, an auger brings the pellets to a burner, and a fan stokes the fire to a low temperature for smoke, or a high temperature for grilling. The temperature is digitally PID contoured (set and forget).   MAK grills are made in the USA and both MAK and Big Poppa stand behind what they sell. Great customer service through the website, and Big Poppa has a forum dedicated to pellet smoking where you can get support or just chat.

That's entirely up to you, no matter what you buy, if you're not putting in the effort, don't bother. Everyone has fuck ups.    I want something electric if possible, because I don't want to have to go out and check on charcoal/temperature every 30 minutes.   I implore you to get a real smoker, you will never get the same flavor quality from an electric smoker, as you will a stick burner. Get something that is 1/4 inch steel and welded together as one solid piece, and you won't have to do much besides shift coals around, and add new wood.   BBQ is a hands on labor of love, if you're wanting something automated, then you're not actually doing bbq."

I'm ready to eat something that has been cooked on low heat and surrounded by smoke for many hours.  I'm not too worried about dirty glances from BBQ puritans.    That said, I'm all for hearing some qualitative differences between electric and coal-fueled smokers.  But I was under the impression smoke gives the flavor and coal gives the heat, and by using electricity for the heat, you've got a much easier process for cooking.  Is this wrong? You guys seem to know what you're doing so I'm all ears.    Let's put it this way: I'm not going to choose a charcoal or wood fired smoker just because I want to be old-school. But I'll do it if there's a specific reason it's better.  Thanks in advance."
BBQ,3duljd,EH6TunerDaniel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:04:05 2015 UTC,"If a heating element goes out on you in the middle of a cook, you have to fix it, before you can continue cooking, which means you probably need to switch to using your kitchen stove. If the heating element goes out on a stick burner, it's because your fire went out, not because something broke down.   As for the heat source all together, it depends on how you cook. I use charcoal just to get the fire started, from there it's nothing but oak. As for why I do it with a stick burner? Thanksgiving the heat element went out on my electric smoker, and there was a 14 lb bird that only got half cooked."

BBQ,3duljd,LaTuFu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:13:53 2015 UTC,To get the most flavor you need wood and charcoal.  Electric has wood chips.  A smoker with chunks and charcoal is going to give the best flavor.   Believe it or not charcoal gives a lot of flavor.

BBQ,3du45t,ssa7777,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:17:20 2015 UTC,I agree. Cutting the rib tips off before smoking gives a more even cook. And rib tips are good to!
BBQ,3du45t,beachgood-coldsux,-2,Sun Jul 19 16:42:37 2015 UTC,"3/2/1 is a good method for baby backs, but St. Louis cut is going to take a bit longer.  The long and short of it is that your ribs aren't done.  That cartilage/gristle is collagen.  By cooking low and slow, you're converting that collagen to gelatin.  When the conversion is complete, the cartilage will be gone, and your ribs will pass the bend test."
BBQ,3du45t,Cdresden,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:44:00 2015 UTC,This is completely incorrect.  Baby backs are usually cooked 2-2-1.  Spares 3-2-1.  He's talking about the rib tips from not cutting all the way to the bone.
BBQ,3du45t,SignalAmp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:02:20 2015 UTC,"I think that you are confused.  Collagen is not the same thing as cartilage.  Under any normal circumstance, you won't ever turn the cartilage in rib tips into gelatin.  When pork ribs are done, cartilage is still there.  In the case of a St Louis cut, the cartilage is mostly trimmed off with the tips.  But ribs being done have nothing to do with the state of cartilage."

BBQ,3dtne4,dvnear,2,Sun Jul 19 10:06:20 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of brining poultry before smoking.  I like this recipe.  It uses ice, so it's ready to use in an hour rather than having to wait overnight.  It's a complex, flavorful brine, not just salt and water, so it's similar to a marinade.  After brining, you can pat dry, then sprinkle a light rub inside and out, before smoking at high heat, 350-375F.  And spatchcocking is the way to go.  ───  I sometimes like to use a recado (spice paste) rather than a dry rub when smoking meats.  This allows you to include fresh herbs, garlic and other ingredients rather than just powdered dry herbs and spices.  I like to use the following on chuck roast, then pull for tacos:  Rosemary Lemon Recado  This is a paste.  Rub it on and let sit for 4-8 hours before smoking.  2 Tb honey 2 Tb fresh crushed garlic                1.5 Tb salt                  1 Tb New Mexico red chile powder, mild          (or a good Hungarian paprika like Szeged) 1 Tb minced fresh rosemary 1 tsp fresh cracked black pepper zest of 1 lemon 1 Tb Worcestershire 1 Tb toasted sesame oil 1 tsp ground cumin                   1 tsp whole oregano 0.5 tsp ground coriander                 0.5 tsp cayenne        ───  It's worth the time to have a look a Steven Raichlen's ""The Only Marinade You'll Ever Need""."

I think this subreddit is more geared towards smokers (in America BBQ is generally low and slow smoking more or less).  That being the case, the best way to prevent a grease fire is to simply clean your grill regularly and if you have a grease trap, empty it. Also if you're cooking really fatty food, don't overload it. Don't press burgers while you cook them with the spatula, don't grill a pack of bacon on high heat...you know.  If you get flare-ups sometimes you can spray them but you can also just manage the lid/oxygen too. Keeping the lid shut usually helps there, but if you had a ton of grease and lit your stuff like that just preheating, you just had way too much grease in your grill.   This is an issue with offset smokers too, though. Lot of people run grease valves/drainage etc."

BBQ,3dqv5n,Krawbeard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:05:02 2015 UTC,Nice ribs op.  Did the same last week with Atkins rub and applewood chips.   Honestly can't tell the difference from using a real smoker.  Not to mention a lot easier to maintain temperature
BBQ,3dqv5n,Krawbeard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:33:01 2015 UTC,I also did 1 rack with no mob. The smoke Taste where incredible. Ok the the smoke ring is not aus thick as on a smoker but i think less is sometimes more :-).
BBQ,3dqv5n,Krawbeard,2,Sat Jul 18 19:36:34 2015 UTC,If you haven't already i suggest right before you foil wrap to put a whole sliced yellow onion on top of the ribs.  adds great flavor to both the ribs and the onions.  Wait till the onions are almost see through caramelized.  I'm not a big fan of onions but this is just delicious.
BBQ,3dqv5n,maineblackbear,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:42:53 2015 UTC,Mmh i use some onion rings on the ribs for marinading.  Will put them in the foil next Time :-) thank u!

It's a good way to get the meat done a little quicker while still preserving the smoky goodness. Just make sure you give the meat some time to  rest when you take it out of the oven.

BBQ,3dnegu,tothesource,2,Fri Jul 17 23:38:20 2015 UTC,"The tortillas were amazeballs. I had just gone to Franklin the week before so that could be part of it, but I've had most smoked Brisket around central Texas. They gave me a slice of fatty that was cut too thick on one end. The first bites were good, but most of it was tough and too smokey.  Brisket should be cut where every bite has a good ratio of bark / fat / meat. I would definitely go back for the tacos, just not straight up smoked meat."
BBQ,3dnegu,chilfhunter,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:42:23 2015 UTC,"It certainly sounds like you know your brisket, but I think you're right that Franklin might have played a role, if nothing more than mindset in your assessment.   I would wager that the lingering dream of Franklin combined with the fact it sounds like you didn't get a good/great slice as main culprit for you not enjoying the meat. If/when you go back for tacos, ask for a quarter pound slice of some of the fatty. I reckon what you got is a one off.   but no matter what- holy shit those tortillas"
BBQ,3dnegu,tothesource,2,Sat Jul 18 00:22:44 2015 UTC,"Ya I got a chicken taco, a brisket taco (came out chopped, was expecting a slice) and 1/4 of fatty. Chicken taco rocked my world. Had the brisket been sliced properly it would have been much better. I'll give them another go when they move back to Star Bar, I've never in the Brodie area as I live east and work up north. But yes, those tortillas!!"
BBQ,3dnegu,chilfhunter,2,Sat Jul 18 00:31:19 2015 UTC,"So quick update: I was in the neighborhood Saturday for a day time house party / concert thing, and Valentina's was just a mile away. I had a few beers by then, but I hadn't eaten all day. Swung by a grabbed 2 chicken tacos and 1/4 of lean. Tacos were on point as expected, but the lean was definitely all business. It was sliced correctly and nice and moist. Not quite as good as franklin but it was up there in the top 5 or so of Texas BBQ. Fat was rendered perfectly, though I prefer oak or pecan to mesquite smoke. Valentina's has redeemed themselves in the brisket department. It's not easy to keep the lean moist, but they did and it was good stuff."

But after that, the temp should stabilize and your cook will continue and be similar to your previous ones.  Maybe plan on 30 more minutes of cook time, unless the 3 racks are significantly lower (or higher) in weight or thickness."

BBQ,3dna56,dendaddy,3,Fri Jul 17 21:48:04 2015 UTC,Make sure you get as much as the cure off as possible. If not it will end up too salty. I learned this one the other month. It was awesome but too salty.
BBQ,3dna56,the_doughboy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:25:07 2015 UTC,"Make sure you get as much as the cure off as possible.   Close. Learn to take a slice off, fry it up, and soak until you have how much salt you want."
BBQ,3dna56,Iwasborninafactory_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:31:06 2015 UTC,How do you do this and what do you mean?   Why would a BBQed corned beef be saltier than boiling it?
BBQ,3dna56,skwerrel,3,Fri Jul 17 20:18:56 2015 UTC,"Boiling it causes much of the salt to be leeched out in to the water.  This won't happen in the dry environment of the smoker.  You can achieve much the same effect by simply soaking the corned beef in cold water.  How long depends on the size of the brisket and how much salt you want to remove.  I usually get a flat cut corned beef and soak it for a total of 4 hours, changing the water every 30-45 minutes to maximize the effect."

BBQ,3dna56,the_doughboy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:04:58 2015 UTC,When you cure a brisket to make corn beef or Pastrami you're generally using a lot of salt and probably curing salt as well. You need to get rid of as much of the cure as you can or the salt can over power it. When you boil a corned beef most of the cure is gone from it as well
BBQ,3dna56,savyur,2,Fri Jul 17 23:18:19 2015 UTC,"Rub with pepper, call it something different... Maybe pastrami?"
BBQ,3dna56,3rdIQ,2,Fri Jul 17 18:03:43 2015 UTC,"So you have a corned round roast, verses a corned brisket... and you want to make a pastrami?  I can get corned rounds on occasion, and I make pastrami with them.  The main differences are the shape (a round is thicker than a brisket) and the fat content (a round is leaner than a brisket) and the fact that with less fat, a round will not be as moist as a brisket. The pastrami in the photo has been chilled, just look at the veins of fat... was less than you would see in a brisket pastrami.  With either cut you need to do a soak-out.  2 hours to 8 hours depending on how strong the producers brine is, and how much salt you want to leech out.  I prefer a 3 hour soak on mine.  Next you need to season it with a peppery, garlicky, corriander rub, and let it rest in the fridge overnight.  For smoking I prefer pecan or oak, and smoke them until the internal is around 150 and I have some nice color.  For finishing (the tenderizing step) I prefer a pressure finish, but other options are steaming, braising or a foil wrap finish.  The photo shows 3 brisket pastramis in my 18 quart pressure canner.  I go 40 minutes at 13 psi and use natural release."

It stalled at 171/172 for what seemed like 90 minutes. Ended up wrapping it then. Felt like forever for such a small piece of meat.   Both got a basic rub of paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder, a tiny bit of Chipotle powder, salt, pepper, and brown sugar with the ribs also getting some bbq sauce for the last hour.   Temps were between 235-255 for most of the time. One spike to about 270 and started off too low around 200 but it stabilized for most of the cook. Still very much getting used to setting the airflow on this akorn. I might try one mod I've seen using nomex tape for the bottom vent for a better seal. That's for another day though."

BBQ,3dktj6,pt606,4,Fri Jul 17 03:48:05 2015 UTC,"I did it as close as I could to the ""volcano"" method over on kamadoguru.com . So using an empty paper towel tube I stacked the lump up around it in a mound with the center almost touching the grate that holds my deflector. Then I dropped in one of my Weber wax cube firestarters and pulled the tube out. Lit the cube and put one or two lumps over the flame. Once the center caught I closed down the lid and opened the top and bottom vents maybe 1/3 of the way. Once it got to 200 or so I knocked both down to somewhere between the 1 and 2 setting below and just barely open up top. Waited a bit for it to stabilize some then adjusted the bottom from there.   With all that said I'm still kinda bad at it having only done it 3 times if you count the seasoning."
BBQ,3dktj6,pt606,3,Fri Jul 17 03:57:51 2015 UTC,"I light mine off with those Weber wax cubes. One cube in the center keeping the bottom vent full open with the dome open too for about 10 minutes. Then I close the dome, shut the bottom vent to #1 and the top vent half way shut. Until I start to reach the temperature range I'm looking for. Then I make the final adjustments. For mine, it seems to work great having the bottom vent open to .5 and the top vent 1/4 inch. Your mileage will vary."

Hope this helps anybody out there. I know there are no measurements but those are the components at least. I have been told that my greens are the best people have had here in Kentucky.

Corn - Either in husk or in tin foil - I sometimes will use olive oil, basil, salt, pepper, and some lime juice. It's great. Feta cheese - This one sounds strange - but buy a 'block' of the cheese. Put the cheese in some tin foil or a container that can withstand heat and add some sliced onions, minced garlic, and salt/pepper.  Let it become a gooey mix and you can put it on burgers or eat it on the side. It's great - a European friend showed me this one.  I will take an onion and core out a bit of the middle. I add in butter, garlic, salt, and pepper and place it on the grill early. That way it's super soft and caramelized at the end - you can put it on the grill by itself or (the safer option) in tinfoil. Really good. Potatoes - I will make ""torpedoes"" of tinfoil filled with sliced potatoes (big chunks or like hash brown sized) and throw in butter, salt, pepper, garlic, and some onions... it is delightful)."

Make sure the bread is toasted properly and the cheese is melted completely, but be very careful because the bread will burn very quickly on a hot grill. You might want to try this once or twice by yourself before serving it to guests because burnt bread is terrible.  Tip no 1: Use butter on the outside of both slices to retain some moisture and added golden crispiness  Tip no 2: Spread some chutney on the inside of one of the slices. If you cannot find chutney, try an onion marmalade or something similar   Edit: Don't forget to add salt and pepper to taste!!

Brisket takes quite a bit of fine tuning to get it how you like it and less tuning, but still a bit with ribs. Pork Shoulder Butts are great. They're delicious and almost impossible to over-cook. Well. I mean, if you go like 4 hours too long then you might, but really, the long you cook, the better it gets up to about 12 hours.   My process is apply rub on all sides of the pork, get temp on pit up to about 225F and put it on for about 8-12 hours. Then I'll crutch wrap for another 2 hours or until really really tender. Best way to tell is gently pushing on it with your palm. If it's soft and malleable like mashed potatoes, it's done. If you've got to push some muscle into pushing, keep it wrapped and going for another hour or so. Again, it's hard to over-cook a pork butt.   Once it's good and tender, let her rest for a while in the wrap! This will help to keep rendering off a good of the remaining fat and make it succulent and moist!"

If you overcook it, it won't matter too much.  I've made several pork butts without monitoring the internal temp by just going off cook time and feel of the roast (poke it a bunch) and it's really no big deal.  If you can monitor the internal temperature, the finished product will probably come out better.  At the very least you need a thermometer to monitor temp in the grill (cook temp)."

BBQ,3dlgm4,AutoModerator,2,Fri Jul 17 05:56:13 2015 UTC,"About a month back (father's day) I did baby backs (comparatively) fast over wood (pecan and oak) and charcoal in the brick oven.  Medium-high but indirect heat with smoke, about 330-350, for an hour; foil-wrapped for about another hour; and finally unwrapped, sauced, and finished over the dying coals for a bit less than one more hour.  They were tender, moist, flavorful... one of the best bbq results I've gotten.  Nice pink smoke ring, perfect texture.  Did them alongside some chicken drumsticks for the kid, which I put in over low coals and some pecan with direct heat for the last hour the pork was in.  Mild smoke and crisp skin.  The brick oven is great for this sort of thing... It holds in a good amount of moisture, as most of the heat throughout the cook comes from the heat radiating from the hot bricks.  I only need a small fire with a few coals to keep the smoke going.  It's like a BGE on steroids.  Only problem is it's hard to work the grill through the small door.  No pics of the food from this go-round, unfortunately; here's a prior installment, though, from a more traditional low-and-slow attempt.  My verdict... with the stable temp and the moisture retention possible in the oven, I don't know if I'll ever go back to waiting 5+ hours for ribs, when the brick oven makes them perfect in half that time.  I suspect you could do the same with a kamado, and with careful fire management, a kettle."
BBQ,3dk0kl,nofishies,3,Thu Jul 16 22:03:03 2015 UTC,"If you are looking to do mostly cold smoking of meats and cheeses with some cooking as well, I would go electric.  It's hard to keep a pellet smoker at a very low temperature. (less than 90F)  That said, the combination of an electric with something like the A MAZ in smoke tube (whatever it's called) works pretty well.  You don't turn the electric on, just use the insulated cabinet to hold the product and the pellets for smoke.   When you want to actually cook something you can just add more heat."
BBQ,3dk0kl,chasonreddit,2,Fri Jul 17 14:58:09 2015 UTC,"You mention ""at least some cold smoking ... can be very tough"". Poultry can be tough when you're smoking since you're not rendering out the fat and crisping/searing the skin without high heat. In my opinion, there is no easy smoking if you want a quality product, and thus nothing is inexpensive.  Some will argue that an electric smoker is not really true smoking."

Don't even bother with the clay saucer, between the broth injection and wrapping it up mid-way through the cook you should be fine.

As far as the grain, it's hard to tell on yours but just look up pictures of other raw briskets online. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but the grain is always going to be going the same direction so you should hopefully be able to figure it out from there.

It's kind of a bummer, but you don't need to do any trimming at all with it.   So you don't really need to inject it with beef stock to have it be moist, but that's a preference thing. Your plan is pretty spot on. Smoke it until 150, really you could if you wanted get it to 160, but it's not needed. I generally will get briskets to 200F, but 195F works just as well. Most important I think is letting it have time to rest. If you get it to 195 and cut it in 20 minutes, you'll find that it is pretty chewy and not tender at all. Give it at least an hour, preferably 2 hours to rest in the wrap to lock in the heat and finish rendering off that fat.   The grain. Always trouble for me. It's difficult to tell with these pre-trimmed briskets. I'm pretty good at just knowing where the grain is as I've been cutting these briskets every day for the past 7 months at my job. The easiest way to find out is to flip it upside down and look at the grain from the base. That way you're not trying to guess on where to cut it from the top. Doing that can lead to being totally wrong on your cut and it just shreds and flakes. It still tastes great, it just loses that good presentation.  (If you do end up shredding it, use that part for some chopped beef sandwiches!)  I hope this helps you out! Remember to try and learn something new every time you smoke. Here's a brisket I cooked from earlier this week that was pre-trimmed. Yummy!"
BBQ,3dhxtz,Pfayze,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:50:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks, for the advice!  It is definitely as thick as I would expect a whole brisket, though.  So maybe pretrimmed, and just the flat?"
BBQ,3dhxtz,Pfayze,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:59:22 2015 UTC,Correct sir! It's just the flat. Sadly it us missing that top section which in my opinion is the best part. It will still turn out delicious though!
BBQ,3dhxtz,Vuelhering,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:06:51 2015 UTC,"btw, it's the breakdown of fats and collegen that really makes it juicy and tender, not just the water.  Obviously you don't want it to lose all water, but in general it's a tradeoff. People often inject phosphates to cause the proteins to bind more water, and it does work, but can also cause it to taste mushy if overcooked. I would consider phosphate if you're intent on injecting it."

BBQ,3dhssn,Weehuw,6,Thu Jul 16 11:32:59 2015 UTC,There is absolutely nothing wrong with a grill brush.  My wife mention some issue about grill brush needles coming off on the grill and then getting stuck in the food.  I can't see how this would happen unless you let your grill become caked with a ridiculous amount of grease such that the needles from a very cheap/old brush come off and become lodged in the grease buildup and then randomly attach to the food you are grilling.  This doesn't sound like a problem unless you are a slob who doesn't keep his/her grill moderately tidy.

BBQ,3dhssn,modix,4,Thu Jul 16 19:12:45 2015 UTC,"I have been around grilling and BBQ all of my life, restaurant grills and short order grills.  I've never heard of anyone get sick/hurt by a grill brush. I think its typical overblown media hype.  One person getting hurt is a tragic, unfortunate accident, not a reason to start a campaign against grill brushes.  JMO.  If you're concerned about the metal brush, then buy a good quality one that is constructed well.  The Stainless Steel Twisted Wire brushes are very durable and clean without damaging your grates if you use them properly.  Once the metal frame starts to make contact with the grates because the bristles have compacted, replace the brush.  It's $6-$10.  The paddle style that have the bristles ""plugged"" into the head can definitely work their way out of the sockets over time, especially if you buy a wooden brush and leave it outside in the weather.  Don't buy that style if you're concerned about the bristles somehow winding up in your food.  Clean your grates while they are warm, before or just after cooking, and you'll never have to scrub very hard anyway.  Proper care and maintenance of your equip is just as important as the cleaning tool."

Keeping the stuff on in between does nothing but protect the grates.   I use an oil soaked rag to wipe down prior to grilling/bbq'ing.  I figure that'd knock off any possible wire pieces.

So come 9am when I get in, we need some fresh briskets for dinner. Instead of our normal cook of about 185 for 12-14 hours, we needed it by 6pm.   We upped our pit temperature to 250, which is our limit. We won't smoke anything higher than that. It was on unfortunately I did have to open the pit to put on ribs, sausage and turkey at different points during the day, but the end result was awesome.   To answer a question that may come up, this was a 5lb brisket. Yes I know it's small. I've talk to the owner about it. We get our briskets from a butcher who pre-trims them down quite a bit. Also, my boss shocked me by saying he isn't the biggest fan of the fatty upper layer of the cut. Made me cry a little bit. So I continue hoping for the day when the butcher doesn't trim as much and I can enjoy that oh so wonderful upper layer.   Anyways, I loved this brisket.

I've done briskets both egg+oven and egg only with good results both ways but I will say that egg only has yielded better bark for me.  You can try wrapping with waxless butcher paper or aluminum foil and then go right back on the egg.  But don't wrap it until after the brisket comes out of the stall. If you smoke it at a really low temp you'll want to raise the temperature in the egg after you wrap it to finish the cook.

BBQ,3das2n,aCause4Concern,4,Wed Jul 15 04:29:09 2015 UTC,"Looks can be deceiving I guess, because it wasn't at all dry. I know it can be easy to cook a brisket until it's too dry because of the long cook time and I have certainly cooked a dry brisket before but this was not one of them.  For this one I trimmed the brisket down to a 1/4"" fat cap and also trimmed away a lot of the fat where the point meets the flat. I slathered it in yellow mustard and equal parts kosher salt and course ground pepper for the rub.  It was cooked in a XL BGE (it barely fit!) with lump charcoal. Used two big handfuls of apple wood chips on top of the lump right as I put the brisket on. Used a plate setter with a shallow water pan on it directly under the brisket. You really need to find a way to fit a water pan in there or you won't have enough moisture and likely will dry it out too much.   Cooked on the grate at 250-260 degrees at the grate and went to  bed.   I didn't touch it again until after the stall. Mine stalled out at around 170 degrees internal temperature in the flat.   It came out of the stall at around 8 or 9 hours into the cook and when the temperature inside the flat climbed to 178 I pulled it off and put it in a loose aluminum foil wrap and then put it back in the BGE.   I raised the cook temp to 275-280 and let it finish that way until it felt like it was ready to take off. When I pulled it off the egg the internal temp was 203 degrees in the flat.   I left it in the foil and put it in an igloo cooler to rest until the internal temp was under 145. The cooler helps hold in moisture during the rest and it's really obvious that it does because the inside of the cooler is really sweaty when you eventually open it. I think the rest period is an important part of the cook but I'm aware some people don't care much about it.   The overall cook time was about 12 hours followed by a 3 hour rest. Whatever doesn't get eaten while it's hot gets wrapped tight in plastic wrap and refrigerated for later. Plastic wrap keeps it from drying out in the fridge much better than foil in my experience.  edit: paragraphs"

I've had good luck using a water pan so far so I guess for me it's better safe than sorry.   Another thing to consider is how much fat you leave on it during the trim. The only times I've ended up with a dry brisket is on long low and slow cooks where I had trimmed it a little too lean."

BBQ,3dbhhs,spunkdonut,3,Wed Jul 15 01:11:47 2015 UTC,You put a nomex gasket on the ring around the grate. It seals things up nicely. Below is a link...  http://www.kamadoguru.com/topic/1295-replacement-bge-gasket-mod-on-my-akorn-lid-and-ash-pan/

BBQ,3dbhhs,ifornia,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:42:56 2015 UTC,"I did the ash pan, the air intake, main opening, and vent with nomex, and closed up the numbers/slots on the intake slide with food grade gasket maker. It makes a huge difference!"
BBQ,3dbhhs,_--___,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:26:56 2015 UTC,"I just got an Akorn last week and can't keep it at 225F, it just keeps steadily creeping up. I did a test run last night and it went up to 380F before I gave up, even though I had closed the bottom vent entirely when it hit 160F. I figure it has to be an air leak.  This mod should fix it, right?"
BBQ,3dbhhs,spunkdonut,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:10:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, it'll help for sure. Also, I made the mistake of not putting my ash pan on right once, I didn't put the middle round piece into the slot correctly, which caused a bad seal. I couldn't keep the temp down for the life of me."
BBQ,3dbhhs,ptgkbgte,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:18:47 2015 UTC,"It should help. It sounds like you may be lighting to many coals too. Start by getting a few coals lit. Close the lid ( with vents both open )after a few minutes. Once the temp starts climbing and you hit 150 ish start dialing the vents back to #1 position. That should get the temp to land around 225. Wind speed and direction are important to note. Ultimately you don't want any ""leaks"" in or out."

BBQ,3d9xwq,wrxnut25,4,Tue Jul 14 17:24:08 2015 UTC,"For ribs, I get the sauce from the rub, the smoke, and the internal juices of the ribs themselves. You get the taste of your rub mixed with the smoky flavor and all combined with the porkiest tasting flavored liquid possible. It sticks to ribs like nothing else and is never overly sweet. Here's how I do it...  For babybacks you want a 2-2-1 method (or 2-1-1 if you want a more toothy bite). So that's 2 hours on the smoker, 2 in foil, and one back on the smoke unfoiled.  When you wrap the ribs up, all the steam that would normally escape into the air gets trapped in your pouch, making it a braising sort of deal, with a super flavorful liquid from the ribs' internal juices. So what you do is when you unfoil for that last hour, collect the juices in a saucepan. Put your ribs back on for that last hour, then start reducing this liquid down.  What you're aiming for is more of a glaze than a sauce. Once it's reduced to a syrup-like consistency and your ribs are done, use a brush and paint some this glaze (save around half of it) on the tops (the meaty convex part) of the ribs. Set a broiler on low, and then park them under the broiler.  You want the glaze to bubble and caramelize and get nice and dark without burning. That's about 60-90 seconds, and you have to watch them like a hawk the entire time.  Cut the ribs up into pairs (or singles) and place into a large bowl.  Take any remaining glaze and drizzle over the ribs pieces, then toss them well to coat.  That's all the sauce you need.  They'll have a great smoky flavor, will be only as sweet as your rub made them, and have a pork flavor that compliments the meat rather than covers it up (the bulk of the ""sauce"" came from within the ribs, after all) so you really get to taste pork. This ""sauce"" works especially well if you really get into your own rubs and wood choices, because the final glaze will be based on both.  One thing to think about it is salt content of the rub. You want to lean toward a less salty rub, as it concentrates down a lot.  Here are my ribs, just after glazing in the broiler and before tossing around in the bowl: http://i.imgur.com/kLKLK.jpg  You can kinda get an idea of how the glaze turns out to be by checking out the top of the rib in the lower left."
BBQ,3d9xwq,wee0x1b,2,Tue Jul 14 18:41:12 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting method I've never tried.   Question, when you foil your ribs do you add any liquids like Butter, apple juice, honey, etc?"
BBQ,3d9xwq,wee0x1b,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:02:15 2015 UTC,"You certainly can add more braising liquid.  I've done apple juice, juice mixed with a little bourbon/brandy, white wine, etc. It depends on how much sauce you want at the end, really. And also how ""tight"" you like the ribs. A wet pouch will really speed up the cooking as they start steaming almost right away.    Butter might be a good addition. But I lean toward the more brown sugary side for the rub, park the ribs in a fridge overnight and let that all mix together. So that's all the sweetness I tend to need. I've also put a couple dashes of red wine or apple cider vinegar in the juices as they're reducing, to make it a bit more tart. It all depends on how it tastes once it comes out of the pouch. And you can also add your apple juice to the sauce and reduce that down. I've done that when I need more sauce.  One reason I like cooking ribs is that I can cut them up into halves and quarters and experiment. So you could do one rack like three ways, try three rubs, try three different braising liquids, etc. Assume wood and heat are constant, and then you can change all kinds of factors.  I will tell you one thing: once you get your rub dialed in, you will never, ever have a BBQ sauce as good as what can be made from the stuff that comes from the inside of the pig itself. Bottled sauce in zero possible ways compares, at all. It's rich, and thick, and gooey and has a mouth feel like liquid meat or something. It's what bottled sauces try to get when they add corn starch and junk. And the flavor is pure pork. It's very powerful, too. You don't need much."
BBQ,3d9xwq,andreas_borealis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:34:06 2015 UTC,Wow.   Any reason this wouldn't work for pulled pork? Just mixing in the reduced juices into the meat after pulling?
BBQ,3d9xwq,wee0x1b,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:17:14 2015 UTC,"I think it would work fine for pulled pork. Definitely if you like a thicker sauce.   One thing that might be a little iffy is that you have a lot of volume in a pork shoulder compared to the surface are than with ribs. So I don't know how much juice you'd get. But like I said in a reply, you could always bulk it up with apple juice/bourbon/whatever in the pouch phase (or after)."
BBQ,3d9xwq,andreas_borealis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:29:58 2015 UTC,"Any time I've done butt in the oven, there's been lots of liquid so I expect a fair amount in the pouch. Thanks again, I'll see how it goes tomorrow!"

BBQ,3d9xwq,wee0x1b,0,Tue Jul 14 18:39:13 2015 UTC,But it's Sweet Baby Ray's... The first ingredient is HFCS.  It has liquid smoke. Why bother with a smoker at all at that point?
BBQ,3d9xwq,Sloots_and_Hoors,2,Tue Jul 14 18:42:11 2015 UTC,HFCS is a sweetener like cane sugar.  That shouldn't be the deciding factor on whether something is good or not.
BBQ,3d9xwq,wee0x1b,0,Tue Jul 14 18:57:45 2015 UTC,"HFCS is a sweetener like cane sugar.   Sure, I know what it is: it's fructose and glucose.    That shouldn't be the deciding factor on whether something is good or not.   I agree completely. But there's one more key piece in my post that influences my opinion: ""The first ingredient is HFCS.""  That's why I think it's not good on BBQ. It's is way too sweet, and very easily covers up the taste of the combination of the pork, the rub and the smoke I try very hard to create harmoniously.  It's the BBQ equivalent of putting ketchup on a steak. It's your steak, you're paying for it, and you can most certainly eat it however you like. If what you want to taste is mostly a sugary/vinegar/tomato flavor with hints of beef behind it, then knock yourself out. But you're better off just putting that ketchup on a burger and saving yourself a pile of money.   If what you want to do is douse your ribs with SBR's, why bother with the smoker or a dry rub? Just fire up the oven and let the liquid smoke and HFCS get you where you want to go. The ribs will be cooked, and they'll be sauced. They'll be like restaurant ribs, at like Chili's or some such. Nothing wrong with that at all if it's what you happen to like, but it's not really what I prefer.  There's just not much point in going to all the bother to rub and smoke the meat if all that flavor is just going to be covered up in an overly sweet sauce with liquid smoke in it.  When I make BBQ, I work hard at controlling the sweetness through the rub and the smokiness through the wood, and try really hard at letting the meat taste come through as much as possible, with those flavors complimenting it.  That's really all I was getting at with HFCS being the main ingredient."
BBQ,3d9xwq,Sloots_and_Hoors,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:23:54 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're saying, but I think you're resting on laurels.  His recipe had what?  A combined total of three cups of other ingredients or thereabouts and 1/2 c of bottled BBQ sauce?  That's not much to rail against.  It certainly doesn't warrant questioning someone's sincerity in their BBQ pursuits.  If it were my recipe, I'd use the rib drippings like you suggested in your recipe as a replacement for 3/4 c. water.  At that point, you'd have to really work on throttling sweetness with vinegar or hot sauce or whatever, but you can make a kickass glaze with bottled BBQ sauce."
BBQ,3d9xwq,wee0x1b,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:47:07 2015 UTC,"Well, like I said, I try hard to get a certain taste on BBQ. I personally find SBR's to be terrible -- just my opinion. It reminds me of McNugget sauce.  Different strokes, I guess."

If they had sold it as slow cooked brisket it would have been impressive. Marketing it as bbq brisket was a crime against the bovine race and those who smoke for flavour.

Right now I have a 2x2m garden shed that is 80% full of clothes.   Where are you located, out of interest?"

Unless you live in Canada and want to support the home team, which I would totally understand.  PS check CL in your area for a few days.

Prepped - took a knife and cut down to the bone about an inch from the knuckle, be sure to cut through all the tendons. Grab a napkin/towel and pull the excess meat at the knuckle over the top and off. Apply pressure and push the remain meat down to one side to begin to form the lollipop. Take a pair of kitchen scissors and cut all the exposed tendons out as well as any overly excessive skin. I then took a pair of needle nose pliers (this leg gets pretty slippery) and pull out the small bone shard along the main bone shaft. Rub with your favorite rub and prep your Q, not necessary but I wrapped the bones with foil to keep them white.  I smoke over apple wood @ 325 for 1.5 hours at which point I pulled them and sauced them with a sweet chili sauce and put back on the smoker to set the sauce for 30min.   The prep is a long part but you get the hang of it towards the end. I will be doing this at my next party at my house as it was cheap and tasty handheld treat.

BBQ,3d6dv0,stinkyhippy,2,Tue Jul 14 01:01:17 2015 UTC,How much does the temperature vary from one end to the other?
BBQ,3d6dv0,i_suck_at_aiming,2,Tue Jul 14 02:32:26 2015 UTC,"In the main chamber there's a slight variance, 5-15 degrees less the further you move from the firebox.  Between the main chamber and vertical there's a sliding pop baffle to help regulate temps more.  Haven't set up a digital thermometer in the vertical but the true temps installed read about 50-75 degrees cooler in the vertical compared to the main chamber when the baffle is wide open.  Imagine its closer to 100 degrees difference with it closed.  Overall it heats up quick and holds temps really well.  The guy I bought it from had a whole lot of extras ordered with it including an extended main chamber (50"" x 30"") and a 1/2"" thick firebox."
BBQ,3d6dv0,darthvadersnipples,2,Tue Jul 14 15:11:04 2015 UTC,"Awesome, but just curious, why you mounted it in the dead center like that?

BBQ,3d6dv0,Sloots_and_Hoors,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:55:32 2015 UTC,"That WOULD be a cool setup but positioning came down to weight really.  Its roughly 1500lbs with a lot of the weight in the firebox which is 1/2"" steel so that would've been too much to mount toward the front near the hitch facing back.  I'll hopefully one day put in some storage boxes/shelves behind the smoker, propane burners on the front, some d-rings for cooler tie downs.  Room to grow.  I'm a tall guy so as it is I can access the main chamber standing on the ground and plenty of room to stand and work too."

BBQ,3d64k4,Sloots_and_Hoors,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:41:13 2015 UTC,"A couple of details-  Here's our savory rub with a few modifications.  This has been our go-to for a couple of years now.  We really like the different flavors, especially celery seed.  Of course, there is still a sweet element to the rub and certainly more sweet added with brown sugar in the wrap.  The test sweet rub was Meathead's Memphis Dust with no mods.  Enough people raved about it that I figured it would be the go-to.  It was good, but boring.  Sweet on top of sweet with some savory notes.  The wrap had three tablespoons of apple juice, a sprinkling of brown sugar, and a squeeze of butter.  Next time, we're going to cut down to two tablespoons of apple juice per half-rack and put a little more butter in the wrap to try and put some moisture in the ribs.  Again, I think we're going to shoot for 1.5-2hrs. wrapped.  So, 2-2-1 instead of 2-1-2.  Sauce.  I like Sweet Baby Rays with modifications.  I know that a bunch of purists just threw up a little bit, but hear me out.  I cut it with Gator Hammock hot sauce.  Gator hammock is interesting in and of itself because it has garlic and other assorted spices, so it makes a relatively bland BBQ sauce a lot more interesting.  We use a ratio of roughly four parts BBQ to one part hot sauce.  The braising (wrapped) drippings are used to thin it out to a more manageable consistency.  So, we didn't get the moist ribs that we wanted, but the test was a success overall.  We like savory and we like wet.  Next time we're going to mess around with the wrap and see what we can do.  We usually do okay with moisture.  Actually, we have gone really close to over-braising them a number of times, so your guess is as good as mine. Still, I think these are better than the first rack I ever cooked and we're still heading in a positive direction.  tl;dr- Ribs are easy to get good and really hard to get great"

I am having a hard time starting it low and slow, it gets too high initially with my BBQ Guru and takes forever to drop, although i don't have the proper adaptor yet (ordered but hasn't arrived).  The proper adaptor may seal air leaks and keep the temperature down properly."
BBQ,3d64k4,chilfhunter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:19:18 2015 UTC,"Try setting your guru twenty to thirty degrees low in the beginning and ease into your desired temp. It takes an hour or more for everything to settle in. Really a temp controller is good for long cooks, I have found."
BBQ,3d4ti0,Shepherding,6,Mon Jul 13 15:07:52 2015 UTC,Keep the lid on during the indirect portion.  If anything your chips smoke more when you take the lid off site to the increase in oxygen which will might your chips. Your also more likely to kick up ash and you increase the amount of possible soot/creosote.  Without knowing your final temp or desired final temp you may also be searing for to long at the end.  I'd also recommend woods chunks instead of chips.  If you really get into reverse searing meat with smoke check out recipes for Santa Maria Tri-tip.
BBQ,3d4ti0,muhaski,3,Mon Jul 13 15:44:21 2015 UTC,"You weren't causing a ton of smoke from the wood chips, you were choking the fire and it was gasping for air."

BBQ,3d4ti0,crackered,3,Mon Jul 13 17:47:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with your tips regarding the lid and final searing time. Like you said, it depends on the final desired temp. I personally like medium rare and have decided that searing once the steak reaches around 105°F is preferred."
BBQ,3d4ti0,crackered,2,Mon Jul 13 16:41:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response!  I kept the lid on during the indirect portion.  I only took it off briefly to let some of the smoke out as I was hoping letting the wood chips burn quickly would stop the smoke and my neighbors wouldn't complain.
BBQ,3d4ti0,crackered,3,Mon Jul 13 17:47:02 2015 UTC,"Any particular reason you wrapped in saran wrap when brining?  I leave mine uncovered, which seems like it would help better with expelling surface moisture. Probably doesn't make much of a difference either way, especially for such a short period of time.

If you want to go baller off the bat, I don't know anyone personally who has this but this would seem like the way to go, Bradley  Personally, I like being hands on with my cooking and in after thought, I should have just went with ol' faithful weber . Yea you have to check the temp and make sure it's smoking properly but a legit charcoal grill is the way to go.     If your looking to be lazy, get an electric smoker with a dual thermometer. If your going to be hanging out while your cooking/hosting/drinking and you want the full access of a grill also, get a Weber.    I'd personally go with a Weber, there are enough tutorials on how to smoke properly with it and you can fire it up to grill any time you want.     Good luck."

There's also a Smokenator accessory you can buy that will rig out your kettle as a smoker, but like /u/seuaniu already said, the snake method works very well in a kettle.  You really don't need a dedicated smoker if you have a Weber, unless you're doing large cuts or cooking for big groups and need the extra space.  For the occasional boston butt or ribs, its pretty hard to beat."

I'm not getting that nice outer texture that I see in many videos on youtube, or in the pictures posted on here.   Just last night I decided to order a Pit Barrel Cooker after reading many reviews, and watching countless videos.

BBQ,3d6drf,LaTuFu,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:10:10 2015 UTC,"It's hard to go wrong with starting out with a Weber 22"" Kettle.  It is an incredibly versatile piece of kit, and you can pretty much go in any direction you like with one.  It's a world famous grill, with accessories ranging from a rotisserie to a Pizza Stone kit.  There is also a smoker accessory, but you really don't need it to get started.  There are plenty of ""how to"" videos on YouTube to guide you in your first forays.    Stick to simple(r)/more forgiving cuts like a Boston Butt at first, then branch out as you learn more.  Buying a dedicated smoker is something to consider down the road once you've learned how to do it.  You may find its too much trouble, or you may find that for the amount of food you're cooking, your trusty Weber Kettle is all you need.  If you want to go cheap, the Original Kettle is around $100.    I highly recommend getting the Weber Charcoal Chimney and a good digital thermometer that can read grill temp and meat temp simultaneously.  That's really all you need to get started.  The plus side to going this route is you can also use it to grill burgers, steaks, chicken, etc.  And if you decide you aren't really into smoking that much, you have a great grill that you can use for other things.  If not, Weber grills are easily sold on CL and usually don't last very long for sale."

BBQ,3d46v3,RoboRay,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:40:09 2015 UTC,Will do. Thanks! Just read the post title on the front page and found out about it. Reddit is making me wait an hour though so I'll probably do it tomorrow.
BBQ,3d46v3,RoboRay,4,Mon Jul 13 11:43:27 2015 UTC,"This is my father's setup: http://i.imgur.com/jPX0h5l.jpg http://i.imgur.com/18kx3ll.jpg  The smoker box on top (originally built by my great-uncle 60-70 years ago) is aluminum on the outside, steel on the inside, with a layer of insulation between them.  This solves the heat-retention issue as well as keeping the weight down.  If you're building an all-metal design, I think steel is the way to go."
BBQ,3d46v3,dabius,3,Mon Jul 13 15:02:46 2015 UTC,I like the idea of the dual materials. My problem with straight steel is the likelihood of rust problems. I know it's not an issue if you oil it after every use but I know my family well enough to know that won't happen. I might just copy that design. I will commit blasphemy by using propane to heat the fire box though. My dad works too long hours to nurse a fire.
BBQ,3d46v3,Alergic2Victory,4,Mon Jul 13 15:29:52 2015 UTC,"There's never been any issue of rust on the inside steel of that box, and it even sat abandoned (under a shed roof, but exposed to blowing rain) for about 20 years before my father salvaged it (and the steel firebox door along with the interior fire-bricks).  The aluminum exterior has some mild pitting, but I expect it's got at least another 60-70 years of life left.  The aluminum will definitely weather better than a steel exterior.  I'm not certain what type of steel sheeting was used for the interior.  If you do copy the design, go for big doors on the long side instead of little doors on the end.  You'll have easier access to the middle of the grate.  Oh, and don't forget some notched bars running across near the top, for hanging meat above the grate.  That box has had up to a dozen turkeys hanging in it at once."
BBQ,3d46v3,delwoodsbbq,2,Mon Jul 13 15:36:22 2015 UTC,Good idea with the bars. I'm planning  o make one of the sides a huge door. It will let a lot of heat out whenever you open it but that won't be frequent.
BBQ,3d614i,Nemerosis,5,Mon Jul 13 20:17:25 2015 UTC,"Costco when their prime meat is on Sale.   For most stuff, I go to a specialty butcher because their quality is above and beyond anything from a Super Market."
BBQ,3d614i,marrowisyummy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:56:41 2015 UTC,"It seems like our Sam's Club has a good selection. I have no experience buying brisket or pork or anything other than the usual steak, burgers, pork chops. I'm not confident in what I should be looking for, or watching out for when selecting cuts."
BBQ,3d614i,marrowisyummy,2,Tue Jul 14 01:03:43 2015 UTC,"Briskets are easy. Always check the flat is uniform across the meat. You don't want one side super skinny and the other side fatty; it'll cook very uneven and it will be hard to get a read on the temperature with such a brisket. Brisket, like any other type of red meat, you want a good amount of marbling on the bottom side of the packer. Get untrimmed, whole packer briskets and trim it at home. I usually remove the deckle on the underside of the brisket, and leave most of the fat on top.   Pork shoulder butt (or picnic roast) just grab whatever. These are very forgiving to cook and just get whatever is on sale. I've yet to fuck up a shoulder. I would probably have to try to do so and still it would be difficult to do.   I lived 11, god awful horrible years in San Antonio and I was never impressed with the meat at HEB. Maybe the Central Market had better grades but I don't remember being wowed with their meat when I lived in TX. I live in Los Angeles again now (and I'll be damned if I leave again) and we have top fucking quality meat here from a variety of sources. I'm spoiled."

BBQ,3d614i,BlazingCattles,3,Tue Jul 14 03:21:53 2015 UTC,Kansas City here.  Briskets - Costco when their primes are on sale.  Restaurant Depot usually has a good deal on CAB. Bichelmeyer's for their waguys or creekstone farm prime.   Ribs - restaurant depot far and away have most consistent three packs. Do not recommend Bichelmeyer's for ribs.   Chicken - I usually buy smart chicken from any number of local grocery stores  Pork - Costco usually has pretty consistent two packs. You can always go to Bichelmeyer's and they will let you hand pick what you want  Sausage - Bichelmeyer's ground sausage and BBQ sausage. All day.

BBQ,3d1amw,crazyjd64,3,Sun Jul 12 18:21:37 2015 UTC,"Looks good. The main issue I've had with Kamodos is enough grill space for multiple racks of ribs. Did you trim your ribs to fit? And when you wrapped, did you stack them or back in the racks?"
BBQ,3d1amw,biggjoe4u2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:19:28 2015 UTC,6 ribs was about max 7 would of been pushing it. I trimmed the ribs st.louis style and didnt cut off anything length wise. They touched the inside of the cooker walls and I had to close the lid carefully not to move the ribs but after cooking they shrunk and it was a good fit. After I wrapped them I put them back on the rack but stacking could of worked too didnt think of that.

To slow down wood from burning away, it needs to be in an oxygen deprived environment, simple as that. That'll keep it smoldering  slowly and providing that delicious smoke.  It may be difficult/near impossible to create that sort of environment with a Weber Genesis propane grill."
BBQ,3d39d1,aCause4Concern,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:27:38 2015 UTC,"Masterbuilt XL here. The best way to save on wood is to buy bigger chunks it decreases the surface to mass ratio and they take way longer to burn. If you use chips or something like them they burn up super fast. Also, I will put 3-4 big chunks in, and only do it twice per smoke you get plenty of smoke on that baby and after a while you get no return for more wood, and are just wasting money and opening your smoker too often."
BBQ,3czktq,PiERetro,18,Sun Jul 12 05:26:56 2015 UTC,"I'd been wanting to try this for a while! I marinaded the lamb leg overnight in a purée of garlic, rosemary, red wine and olive oil. It went in the smoker at 1100 in the morning, at 225f.   I used chucks of oak on the charcoal throughout the smoke. By 1500 it reached an internal temperature of around 150f and stalled there, so I foil wrapped it, and left it in for another hour or so. It was finished off in the oven, in the foil, at 220f, until the internal temperature reached 195f, then rested for an hour in the warm oven.  It pulled beautifully, the bone came clean out and a couple of minutes with my meat rakes was all that was needed. I served it in hot pitas, with Tzatziki, and it was delicious, moist, smokey, but the garlic and rosemary still came through."

A couple of other notes:  I have a water bath over the coals. In the first picture, you can see my homemade contraption sitting on top of it - its a non stick saucepan with the handle removed, and three bolts installed as legs, which allow it to sit over the water bath. I put some water in there as well as the left over marinade. Over the cook, it catches all the juice allowing it to be made into a sauce, or remixed into the meat at the end of the smoke (great for pulled pork especially!). This time I served it as a dipping sauce as it was incredibly smoky, and people could use it according to their personal taste.  Next time I would take the skin off first, as it was, I removed it before pulling. It was rubbery, and not worth trying to crisp it up."

BBQ,3czktq,Rrrrbbbb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:18:21 2015 UTC,"I've thought about doing this for a while, but give it a barbacoa marinade/treatment and make tacos with it.  Questions: What was the temp when you pulled it off after an hour or so in foil?  How long did you have it in the oven? And/or what was the total time of cook, including oven and smoke?  I've never done a smoke+oven cook, so just curious how much time that could save since the smoke flavor only comes in that first hour or two."
BBQ,3czktq,Rrrrbbbb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:47:01 2015 UTC,"It was over 160f when I pulled it out of the smoker, then maybe an hour and a half in the oven. Once it hit 195f I just turned the oven off, and left it until it was time to eat, which was about an hour. From looking, I'd say that at least the first four hours smoke added to it, after that it was difficult to tell. I admit that I'm a big fan of oven finishing. As well as the control factor, it leaves my small smoker free for other things for the table - last night I did moinks and chicken wings in the smoker while the lamb was in the oven, so more smokey treats for everyone!"
BBQ,3czktq,GiggleFats,4,Sun Jul 12 19:28:16 2015 UTC,Looks awesome!  Isn't lamb pretty lean? I've always wanted to do up a lamb roast for pulling but always assumed it would come out dry because a lack of fat in it..  But it looks like I assumed wrong!  Nice work.
BBQ,3czktq,DrTheSciNerd,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:52:51 2015 UTC,I think the olive oil in the marinade helped - I stabbed the leg all over with a skewer to help it infuse. Also the water bath keeps it moist and the resting at the end too!
