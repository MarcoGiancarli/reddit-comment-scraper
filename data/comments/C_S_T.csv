C_S_T,3e35vz,Redditor9876543210,2,Tue Jul 21 16:41:25 2015 UTC,"Good idea. A couple of thoughts:   The size of the hydra headed M.I. Complex is so vast and  complex that it is barely possible to separate from the rest of the economy. For example, ""Country Music Television"" may be owned by people who are owned by the MIC and may contribute through regular news items to the general message encouraged by the MIC even if it would not normally be considered a part. The MIC probably does not have maximising shareholder value or even simply making money as its supreme organising principle as might be said of other market sectors. Arguably the MIC pursues its own security and growth by accumulating power and perpetuating war, and does not worry too much about returns to shareholder (even if it does make gargantuan pay-offs where it is its interest to do so just as it might obliterate people or places when it suits)   You might get a good return on this (hypothetical) fund - or you might just be financing the perpetuation of a monster and only getting back modest returns."

Too often do we see the elderly and infirmed simply fading away, in body and mind, all the while being pumped with medicine and supported by machines. I think that we as a society need to come up with a solution, however it will be difficult to stomachfor many. The idea of legalised suicide and/or euthanasia is still taboo, especially in those of a religious persuation."
C_S_T,3e1dhb,Airbiscuits_seen,3,Tue Jul 21 08:42:16 2015 UTC,My main quandary with it is the potential abuse of power it provides to governing bodies.

C_S_T,3e1dhb,Airbiscuits_seen,3,Tue Jul 21 10:59:45 2015 UTC,"In the UK we have legalised suicide (I always found it odd it used to be illegal, and just pictured the person's corpse wasting tax payer's money in a jail cell), but unfortunately euthanasia still hasn't been legalised, and you can be convicted for murder upon return if you take someone overseas to end their misery.

That includes the right to life, and the right to death. In fact, to me, the right to death is the most paramount right any individual has, for the simple reason of they are the one living the life, they should have the choice of when they wish to end it if not by natural means.  If you're depressed, or terminally ill, and you've all but given up then you should have every right to choose to end your life, or ask for aid in ending your life (assisted suicide/euthanasia). For the latter there should be certain measures met before the death, not to give you the right to die, but to protect those who are helping you so they can't be accused or punished for murder.  It is more selfish to assume your depressed friend should live so you don't have to live with the burden of their death, than it is for them to end their pain knowing they may cause it on you."

C_S_T,3e1dhb,strokethekitty,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:14:44 2015 UTC,"I like ethics questions like these. They are hard.  On a very strict perspective, the right to life should include the right to death, as it is the right of sovereignty over that life. If one would have true sovereignty over their own life, then this must include the right to death.  From a subjective perspective, right to life only means right to live. It is the positive stereoisomer of this question, rather than the racemic version formerly mentioned, and does not include the right to death.  I believe in total sovereignty over ones own. Without getting heavy into politics, i want to mentiom that this whole ""political correctness"" bullshit has gotten way out of hand. In addition to that malignant ideology, is the idea that the general welfare of the whole trumps the general welfare of the individual. Together, these two cancerous ideas espouses a feather soft version of enslavement.   For instance, the terminally ill patient in america has no right to death. He then is bonded to his body amd therefor charged with suffering in pain for the remaindet of his life, allthewhile racking up massive debt that is then passed along to his survivors. All in the name of subjectivity -- so that others wont feel offended or affected by the ""undue"" yet requested termination of his own life.  I feel, under certain circumstances, that request shoukd be granted. It should involve counselours, so as to make the event easoer on them and their family and friends.   But i have a hard time agreeing with allowing severely depressed individuals assisted suicide, as they are not in the right frame of mind to make such determinations. How many folks have tried to kill themselves, failed, and later were so incredibly happy that they failed?   Bottomline, i favor responsibility. For the average adult, they must maintain theor responsibikities amd commitments. For freedom is naught without responsibility. We have freedom of speech -- meaning we can say whatever the fuck we want -- but should we? There is a level of responsibility that allows us to retain our freedom without waivers, while at the same time being mindful of others. We have the right to life -- to me, meaning complete sovereignty over our own lives --, but there mist he some level of responsibility to maintain this life for the betterment of our progeny. To end it out of a fleeting moment of despair, embaressment, frustration, or revenge is irresponsible and naive.   Though, for those fit in mind, when the benefits of death outweigh the torment of life for that individual, i believe his own soveriegnty must reign highest during that decision making process.."

Looking at the history of the ""united"" states of america, it can be said that there has been an ever-present movement to consolidate power within the tier of bourgeoisie/aristocrats. This movement has been gaining inches over generations -- the ""boil the frog"" analogy comes to mind here -- unbeknowst to the general population.  As time moved forward, so did tacit agreements, leading the way to overt nepotism that remains largely unacknowledged by the general folk to this day.  So, in their current progress of their multigenerational scheme, why would they jump ahead a few milestones of their ""master plan"", when they are quite happy with their affairs?   Imo, its not until they feel gravely threatened when they press the button and force a few deafening moves on us. The larger the threat, the grander the move.   Sure, it seems more amd more people are ""waking up"", but even so, they will always be outnumbered by the much more vocal and prevalent ignoramuses. To put things into perspective, a thousand whispers is much more powerful than a single voice.   Point is, things arent slowing down. They arent speeding up (although i might revise that position for the past few years have been a bit unsteady), either.
