When they make their reviews and recommend movies, they're not talking to people like them, just more general audiences who are looking to kill a couple of hours in an air conditioned theater.*  When they say they think TDKR is as good or better than TDK, they're not coming from the perspective of ""TDK is the greatest thing in years, and a cinematic masterpiece!"".  They probably just think TDK is a pretty good movie, which it is -- without Heath Ledger, it would have been a far more forgettable film.  EDIT: I should say most of the time, because a lot of movies they seem to really enjoy for baffling reasons.  Mike enjoyed the recent TMNT movie that Rich and Jay absolutely hated, which is still incredibly baffling to me."

I just watched the review again the other day, and M&J didn't seem to get that every time when she ""dances"" in the 2nd level of the fantasy, that she is getting raped in real life inside the loony bin. So she has to escape even further into her mind to deal with it.   They mention that there were no stakes. That's because we were watching the mental gymnastics of a girl trying to deal the fact that she was being forced to be a prostitute in an insane asylum. She was the bait, while the others did the actual dangerous work of trying to steal the keys and map.  Once the first ""crazy giant samurai"" fantasy happened, they seemed to both say ""fuck this"" and got into hate-mode."

It's definitely where I stopped caring much for Zach Snyder though, it seemed like a big step backwards from Watchmen and I fucking hated Man Of Steel. I don't know about Sucker Punch I haven't heard of many people that enjoyed it. I always felt like a closet Sucker Punch fan."
RedLetterMedia,3e4hql,ElvisNeedsBoats,5,Wed Jul 22 00:42:08 2015 UTC,"I think people weren't expecting the more ""heavy"" stuff, because the trailer only showed the crazy dream stuff.

There have been movies I've seen 5 times until I realized I didn't like it, and vice versa. You just like what you like.  I enjoyed this much more than his comic book movies (especially Man of Steel). I really like his STYLE, but I don't like how he ends up changing well established stories (Watchmen) or characters (everyone in MoS, ESPECIALLY the entire Kent family). Batman v Superman looks like it's going to be WORSE, especially after reading the leaked outline. Sucker Punch was his own universe, so he couldn't ruin THAT."

It didn't make sense why Gone Girl didn't go some where with no people.  Or just not talk to other people.  Or just kill herself as was her intent.  After meticulously planning this thing, she allowed herself to be exploited by a white trash couple within a week. 2.  Neil Patrick Harris makes it a point to show that there are cameras through this house all uploading to the cloud or at least his iPhone.  Why didn't these catch his murder?  Or at the very least, Gone Girl wandering up to his house of her own free will.  Her whole story would have fallen apart. 3.  Gone Girl shows up covered in blood.  No one looks into it further.  Her vaginal bruising would have looked like a bottle, not a wang.  I guess she could have said he assaulted her with the bottle? 4.  As soon as Gone Girl is back, all the steps she took to frame Batman no longer make sense.  So wait, someone staged the kidnapping scene?  And there was blood everywhere that was cleaned up, but not by Batman.  So did NPH stage it it did Batman still do that... Seems like something the cops should investigate further, but... 5.  Case closed!  Even if civil charges wouldn't stick, I feel like the criminal investigation would have to continue.  The intrepid woman cop just quits or something?  Also, why does the FBI not objectively look at this after the fact?  Why does it look so much like Batman killed her?  Is no one going to look into this? 6.  After hinting the cat was involved, it turns out the cat is just a cat.  I would have liked it better if the cat wore a detectives outfit and solved the case.    Amazing Amy!  That's her name, just remembered."

If they didn't give a fuck about Jurassic Park then and now, we most likely won't get a Plinkett review, which is a bit sad because there's a lot of material to work with if they were dedicated enough to the IP.   It's frustrating when your favorite YouTube channel doesn't continually create content because they are too lazy to give a shit."
RedLetterMedia,3dwjiy,privatehuff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:46:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe they just don't want to repeat themselves? A Jurassic World Plinket review would basically just be the same as the star wars prequels but with a point by point replacement;  footage from the original Jurassic Park and the behind the scenes footage and interviews and contrasting it with the new movie(s) and saying ""CGI sucks"" ""actors can't act against green screens and tennis balls"" and ""this writing is awful the characters are barely developed"" and so on and so forth. I think if Mike explained it like that I would grudgingly agree it's better off moving on and not just getting bogged down repeating a formula forever... but either way I was already bummed and typing that all just made me more sad...."

But from the moment Superman saves the bus full of kids and the movie practically scolds the audience for being happy about that with the whole ""What the fuck were you thinking Clark, let everything you can easily prevent go down if it means hiding your identity!"" scene, the film took a gradual nose dive for me. With its continuous fucked morals, poorly developed characters with subsequently confusing motivations, relentless plot holes and ruthless action sequences with little means to their length, once the credits hit and the lights came up in the theatre, I felt like I had been deceived somehow, and I couldn't place why."

RedLetterMedia,3dop9y,Supermunch2000,14,Sat Jul 18 03:34:01 2015 UTC,"As an obsessive Arkham fan I mostly agree with everything said, and quite enjoyed the review.   I didn't hate the Bat-tank however, and enjoyed driving around the city as a change of pace from gliding in City and Origins. I'll easily agree that tank combat was massively overused during the game, but it wasn't bad gameplay, just a bit too shallow, and encouraged as little movement as possible to avoid red lines. I would've liked to see it combined more with the car chases to allow fighting along with some dynamic movement. You might say the stealth tank tried to do this, but I thought those parts were just awful. They brought nothing new to the game, feeling just like the predator sections only with everything removed except crouching around and using silent take-downs.  And while it would've been nice to see the predator sections a bit more densely populated, and have a more interesting mechanic to use FEAR takedowns, I liked a lot of the new countermeasures enemies had here. The heart rate monitor never felt like a challenge to me, and I didn't miss it at all.  SPOILERS As for the story... Well, I called Arkham Knight's identity the day he was announced, so I never felt like I had the chance to even be disappointed by the reveal. But I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this telling of the Todd story and the story overall was pretty good. The whole Ace Chemicals section though was one of the best sequences, story and gameplay wise, that I have ever experienced in any game; and while later areas came close, it was mildly frustrating that nothing else felt like it quite hit the perfect craft shown there. Strangely, the worst part of the story to me was Barbara Gordan's death. Or rather, her cop out resurrection. Her death scene was brutal and appropriately gut wrenching. It was a miserable, awful thing and seeing Batman reeling from it and having to grit his teeth and tell Jim really pushed the weight of the whole scenario down on you. But then no-- it was all fake and everythings just fine. It completely pulled back the punch, instead making me view the death scene as cheap, emotionally manipulative drivel. I liked her character, so while one some level I couldn't help being happy she was OK, it was just a massive disappointment to see they didn't have the guts to show us something that dark and stick with it.  In the end, the most telling thing about the game's strengths is that despite several gameplay and story issues, the horrific PC port, the ridiculous season pass, and the unforgivable lack of challenge maps, I still somehow absolutely love this game and whole heartedly recommend it."

Since I was planning to play the PC version, I haven't yet played Arkham Knight, so I can't directly judge, but many big sites just hailed Arkham Knight as the second coming of Jesus. Gamespot was one of the few well-known sites that gave it a lower grade and fanboys on the game subreddits just lost their minds.  As long as games like Arkham Knight get reviewed like 10/10 masterpieces here to save the human race, companies like Warner Bros. will get away with the shitty DLC, since the reviews for the main game will gain the most attention and DLC review will be much less impactful. People already got the game because of the great reviews, and then decide they want more and buy the DLC. They problably thought they'd get away with the shitty PC version too, since the review codes were all for PS4."

RedLetterMedia,3dn6n2,JackTrig,7,Sat Jul 18 02:24:36 2015 UTC,"For me it actually looks like they took some of the Men of Steel criticism seriously and are now trying to improve in the new movie. The ending of Men of Steel wasn't heroic in the slightest, and a lot about the leaked plot seems to be about how Superman really wasn't that much of a Hero in that battle. A lot of the script seems to make sure that deaths and injuries of civilians seems to be minimal (empty part of gotham, rescuing civilians against doomsday).  The outcome of the Superman/Batman confrontation looks great to me too. It's something that seems to be completely in the characters for me, with Batman risking everything including his life just to make sure that he can trust Superman.  All in all the movie might actually not be terrible if this is really the plot of it. It'll probably not be great, but it could end up good enough to make the whole ""DC Cinematic Universe"" not a complete failure."

RedLetterMedia,3dn6n2,Echono,19,Sat Jul 18 04:24:51 2015 UTC,"Could be worse, but my god, what a clusterfuck. They're introducing like the entire Justice League in one movie to set up the future of their cinematic universe and if this summary is accurate it's going to be such a busy and crowded movie that nobody will give a shit about anything going on by the end.  I know they're scrambling to play catch up with Marvel and the Avengers, but they could have at least introduced the most important heroes in their own movies and spread out the introduction of the lesser known JL members in those, instead of tacking on literally everybody to Superman's story."

RedLetterMedia,3dn6n2,BorisJonson1593,14,Fri Jul 17 19:57:35 2015 UTC,"This is what I don't get. Stuffing too much stuff in was the exact problem with Age of Ultron and now DC's doing the same thing except Snyder isn't anywhere near as good of a writer/director as Whedon and he doesn't have as much existing material to lean on. Why not just make a really tight, self-contained story about Batman and Superman? Why do they need to shove in Lex Luthor and Wonder Woman and a bunch of other Justice League crap? This whole thing is going to collapse in on itself before it really gets started."

RedLetterMedia,3dn6n2,Eiyran,5,Sun Jul 19 04:34:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think even introducing the 'new' Batman in a Batman v Supes movie is a huge mistake. They should have given Battfleck his own movie to get established, including him in this pile of garbage is just going to make him harder for people to swallow.  I'd actually be okay including Wonder Woman in a Batman and Superman movie (Because let's be honest, as important as it is to bring some gender diversity to the JLA, a Wonder Woman solo movie is going to be very hard to sell a studio on), but they even crammed Aquaman and Cyborg in there.   And overall, it's Superman's story (the primary antagonists are Lex Luthor and Doomsday, for christ's sake), so basically they're just making a sequel that's still about Supes, and tacking on everybody else including Batman. Batman is a much more interesting character, and deserves better."
RedLetterMedia,3dn6n2,FuckYouZackSnyder,6,Fri Jul 17 20:16:09 2015 UTC,"Luthor and Doomsday might be the ""villains"", but it looks like Batman is the protagonist, the one moving the plot forward, while Superman is just reacting to things."

And I take that Doomsday is approached in the similar way as the Squid was in the Watchmen comic or how Zod came to Earth because of Superman: Luthor has created him to show the level of threat that Superman implies to the world. As long as he's on Earth, he'll keep on bringing levels of destruction. It's all about the collateral damage."

I think that what this movie will resolve is how the world sees Superman. If you look at the story and the way it follows through with the consequences of his fight against Zod, it's about a world that's not yet comfortable with Superman and how Luthor exploits that.   As I've said before, in a future Superman or Justice League movie, I want to see Superman being allowed to be Superman. I've liked the idea of him being seen as a potential threat and the alien invasion approach they've given to the story, but there's a lot to do with the character they haven't touched on in any live action film."

RedLetterMedia,3do3nt,the_beard_guy,7,Sun Jul 19 22:15:09 2015 UTC,I think in the Transformers 3 or Jack and Jill review they said someone bought the tickets for them.   If they do buy the tickets they can say its a job expense and use it on their taxes and get their money back. Kind of like how you see random cars with websites or company names on the back. You can say you're advertising and use it as a tax write off. Though I dunno if it can be used for seeing movies and reviewing them.   Most likely they probably just use some the ad money from the videos to pay for it.

RLM has a sense of humor probably closer to a show like Seinfeld, in the sense that everyone is a selfish asshole, nobody ever learns lessons, and people being hurt, offended, traumatized, etc. is only ever played for laughs. On the other hand, everyone in The Office has relationships and feelings and sometimes people get ""haha"" hurt, but sometimes people get ""boohoohoo"" hurt.   .....so I really can't say if you'd find it great or ""great"", but it's really well written and I like it a lot."

RedLetterMedia,3dglpw,jeffzedmann,11,Thu Jul 16 09:22:09 2015 UTC,"I always get a little confused at the mention of Eddie Eagle, because there's another Eddie Eagle I knew of growing up. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_%22The_Eagle%22_Edwards#1988_Olympics  He's a British hero."
RedLetterMedia,3dglpw,cuddlewithyourdemons,15,Thu Jul 16 22:39:08 2015 UTC,"I didn't send it, but that Japanese S.O.S. video that won Wheel of the Worst (I forget which number it is) was made by the cult I grew up in. And I've got the companion tape to it; it's called 20 Minutes to Go. Mine is in English though, it was interesting that they got a Japanese version."
RedLetterMedia,3dglpw,cuddlewithyourdemons,5,Thu Jul 16 20:27:57 2015 UTC,You grew up in that cult? Holy shit. Please tell me more.
RedLetterMedia,3dglpw,cuddlewithyourdemons,11,Thu Jul 16 21:14:31 2015 UTC,"I was born into it. Didn't go to school or socialize with normal people until I was 15. It was fucking weird; I grew up REALLY brainwashed. If you have specific questions PM me, I don't mind talking about it."
RedLetterMedia,3dglpw,cuddlewithyourdemons,5,Thu Jul 16 21:29:41 2015 UTC,"Since it is relevant to a WOTW episode, can you give an overview of the cult here?"
RedLetterMedia,3dglpw,cuddlewithyourdemons,17,Thu Jul 16 21:33:54 2015 UTC,"Sure. They were/are a fairly large sex cult who believe an elaborate mythology heavily based on Christianity; at first they were called ""The Children of God"", which they later changed to ""The Family International"". When I was born into it they were already The Family International. They masquerade as a legitimate ""missionary outreach organization"" or some other shit, and perhaps they've changed things and actually do these things now, but I just remember a lot of deeply disturbing things. Growing up I was taught that sex is ""a part of God's love"" so it's okay for everyone to fuck everyone, that we were superior to everyone in ""The System"" a.k.a. ""Systemites"", that one day when the ""EndTimes"" happened I'd get superpowers to help fight the Antichrist soldiers who were going to hunt down and kill us all for being Christian, that Heaven was a place called Space City and it was in the moon, etc.  We lived on these huge communes with multiple families; there were always a shit ton of kids. Usually they divided us up by age groups and the different age groups shared a bedroom/classroom and were supervised/brainwashed by one or two different people assigned to that age group. Once in a while they'd dress us up in matching outfits and take us out in public to sing for money, but we weren't supposed to talk to ANYONE outside ""the family"". You had to call every adult member of the cult ""Auntie"" or ""Uncle"". You didn't spend time with your parents on the regular. One day a week (usually Sunday) you went to your parents' room with the rest of your siblings for an hour or two and this was called ""parent time"". The rest of the time you were following a very strictly enforced routine (get up at 7, make beds/brush teeth, breakfast at 7:15, ""devotions"" at 7:45, bible verse memorizing at 8, and on and on it went). God/Jesus/""Grandpa"" (leader of the cult) were shoved into every single aspect of your life. When we moved from Mexico to the US we weren't allowed out of the house until 3 pm because that was when the normal kids got off the school bus so no one would get suspicious about us not going to school. Most of our food/clothes came from things that were ""provisioned"" a.k.a. begged off different stores/companies. I've blocked a LOT of it out. There was a LOT of really creepy disturbing shit going on behind closed doors. I ran away from one of those homes when I was 7 years old with absolutely no correct knowledge of the outside world, that's how desperate I was to get away. To this day I can't get anyone to tell me where my parents (and most of the other adults) were when I didn't see them, or what they were doing. When David Berg or ""Grandpa"" as I knew him died a lot of things changed and that was when my parents slowly slowly started the transition toward normalcy. We started living in smaller homes with only one or two other families as opposed to 8 or 10 other families. After a few more years we were living on our own but still considered members of the cult. One day at 14 I told my dad I wanted to be normal and go to school. That was the beginning of the end and a year later we were more or less out. I have some videotapes the cult produced that were NEVER released to the public; they're the brainwashing videos I watched incessantly as a child (I snuck them out of my parents' basement a few years back). I'd like to put them on the internet (just so more people could understand just how creepy and deep-set the brainwashing was) but they're VHS and I'm not super technology savvy. Anyway, hope you find this satisfactory, sorry my knowledge of how things worked is a bit fragmented."
RedLetterMedia,3dglpw,CSLouisHighEdition,7,Thu Jul 16 22:03:59 2015 UTC,You could reach out to RLM or the community for help with converting the tapes. A lot of people could help you with that.  Also wow. I really didn't anticipate the SOS video was Childrenofgod/familyinternational. The stuff on that tape was all stuff I recognised from ordinary Christianity.
RedLetterMedia,3dglpw,Fan05,7,Thu Jul 16 22:51:56 2015 UTC,"They made quite a few things that were released to the public. Kiddie Viddies, Treasure Attic, S.O.S., 20 Minutes to Go, all of which are on YouTube now; as well as a number of cassette tapes/CD's featuring the children born into this cult singing various Christian songs. It was all to make them seem like a genuine Christian organization that was all harmless fun. The three VHS tapes I have are labeled ""Family Fun"" and as far as I know have never been released to the public."
RedLetterMedia,3dglpw,jackfirecracker,3,Thu Jul 16 23:36:38 2015 UTC,Do they have culty stuff on them?
RedLetterMedia,3dglpw,NormalNormalNormal,6,Thu Jul 16 23:55:42 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh man. Like you wouldn't believe. Illustrated/partially animated segments explaining the whole Space City thing and how after the Tribulation and Battle of Armageddon we would rule over the peons still left alive on Earth because we would have Heavenly Superbodies and all. Live-action skits demonstrating in really weird ways how it was bad to complain or rebel or disobey. Weeeeeiiiird parts where we just hear about a fucking dream that Grandpa had that we needed to know about for some reason. Looooots of creepy songs. Also many many parts where a young child is explaining something or singing or acting and you can actually see the fear and confusion in their eyes. It's difficult to explain actually, I've never seen anything else quite like them."
RedLetterMedia,3dglpw,CorndogNinja,5,Fri Jul 17 00:01:56 2015 UTC,I really hope you get that stuff uploaded some time. They sound much much more informative about the cult than any of the stuff they make for outsiders.

RedLetterMedia,3dglpw,NormalNormalNormal,11,Thu Jul 16 22:00:31 2015 UTC,"Good question. I've always wondered this. Do they make an effort to put people's tapes in, even if it is just in the background? And I wonder how many tapes they actually receive. I assume ""everyday thousands of VHS tapes"" from the Wheel of the Worst Intro is a gross exaggeration."
RedLetterMedia,3dglpw,QuizzicalButthead,13,Thu Jul 16 04:39:42 2015 UTC,"I have noticed that their 'Nukie shelf' has grown exponentially, so at least they're keeping those."

RedLetterMedia,3dglpw,Cheating_b1tch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:10:28 2015 UTC,Yeh it was that that got me wondering. Both BOTW and WOTW feature movies and videos they've been given since they're almost always unfamiliar with whatever it is they watch. Even right from the first episodes this seemed to be the case.
RedLetterMedia,3dglpw,Fan05,9,Thu Jul 16 04:43:58 2015 UTC,"Both BOTW and WOTW feature movies and videos they've been given since they're almost always unfamiliar with whatever it is they watch   I don't think that proves that they are using tapes sent to them by fans. I'm sure some of them were, but I think a lot are probably just stuff they picked up years ago and forgot about and never watched. When you have a collection that big there is no way you are going to watch and/or remember everything you own. For example, in the first Christmas episode Jay mentioned that he bought Elves in a shop in North Dakota 12 years ago."
RedLetterMedia,3dglpw,bestoftheworst22,2,Thu Jul 16 06:14:04 2015 UTC,"Well certainly, there's stuff that they've definitely bought themselves, but a lot of the crap, particularly on WOTW I can't imagine them acquiring on their own."

A few B movies with A-list stars (Molly Ringwald, Kris Kristofferson, Jeff Bridges, etc.)  And some truly bizarre tapes, like one travelogue movie about a guy driving a Russian motorcycle across the US following the fall of Communism. A ""movie"" featuring half an hour of close-ups of smiling babies, intended to be a sort of goodwill developmental tape created by a baby psychologist where you plop your baby in front of the TV and have it react to other babies smiling at it. Also, a tape called Sponge Painting Made Easy - How to Sponge Paint in Your Household (or something along those lines).

RedLetterMedia,3d64zx,samtrano,9,Mon Jul 13 22:34:45 2015 UTC,"I think those ""jokes"" were actually meant to be satire on the overplayed jokes in Hollywood comedy. This whole trailer seems to be geared towards parodying the trends in recent trailers. The blue space laser is an obvious example, since they talked about how dumb that is in an old Half in the Bag. It was obviously put in this trailer as satire.  That said, I hope this movie is more than just a satire of recent film trends. It's fine to make one of the trailers about that, but I don't want to sit through a whole movie of this. I hope they have something a bit more in store for the full film. I think they will, though."

RedLetterMedia,3cy0ca,SufficientPotato,10,Sat Jul 11 22:25:45 2015 UTC,The comics are actually pretty fun in this regard. Batman is pretty much the most dangerous member of the Justice League because he's so damn smart. He's basically too powerful because he can never be out planned (and of course the unlimited resources to implement the plans).   So Batman can stand up to Superman through planning. He figures out a weakness or sets a trap.

Batman shouldn't be able to have a chance against a superhero that moves at super-speed, can fly, can possibly withstand a nuclear blast. Why even bother to say that Batman is human?   The other interpretation is that Superman pulls his punches every time he fights Batman. Fair enough. Now, in this movie it seems like Batman is out to kill Superman. Why would Superman think twice about killing this guy? There's no previous friendship, the Kents didn't raise him to be a good person (this time it's Ma Kent saying idiotic out of character stuff), there's nothing preventing Superman from killing Batman. This particular version of Superman should kill Batman right away."
RedLetterMedia,3cy0ca,Llaine,4,Sun Jul 12 01:13:25 2015 UTC,"Calling it lazy writing is a valid criticism, but it's almost necessary to correct the problem of Superman himself. He's basically invincible. Anybody who's going to defeat him needs to be able to do it by either overpowering him (not likely) or outsmarting him (maybe). The worst of it comes in the comics when they give Superman godlike mental powers to go along with his strength. In that case, any time he loses to Batman, he's letting Batman win."

Examples are in the Dark Knight Returns, he takes advantage of Superman's weakened state via kryptonite/nuclear winter and fights him to what s essentially a standstill and in Justice League: War he takes advantage of Superman's unwillingness to kill and knowledge of his secret identity.  One big thing to remember about Superman and Batman is that Superman is a muscle-bound farm-boy from Kansas with a bachelor's degree in journalism, he's a brawler that wins most of his fights because he's faster and stronger than anyone else.  Batman, on the other hand, is hands down one of the best tacticians and hand-to-hand fighters in the DC Universe.  Batman won't pick a fight that he doesn't think he will win, he'll prepare and wait for the right moment to strike."
RedLetterMedia,3cy0ca,thymed,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:50:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in both those videos, Batman only survives because Supes holds back.   When talk of the recent Superman reboot first came about, I was hoping for a de-powering of the character almost back to his 1940's origin levels. A guy that was really strong and really fast and could only mostly fly (faster than a speeding bullet, leap tall buildings in a single bound). Basically a modern day Beowulf or Hercules.   The fact that Superman is so overpowered is the biggest challenge when it comes to writing for him. When he has to fight a human it always boils down to relying on his mercy, or using fucking Kryptonite, and sometimes magic.  Let's compare him to how Marvel has dealt with Thor in the movies, who is comparable to Superman in many ways. They've handled Thor very well in terms of how powerful he is by mostly avoiding the question altogether! In the Avengers, he's able to brawl with the Hulk - but then there's a great bit in which the hover-jet starts firing its machine guns into the fray, and Thor hits the dirt in order to avoid being hit, hinting at the fact that the bullets might actually hurt him. His previous scrap with Iron Man similarly ends with Cap interrupting the fight right before Iron Man is about to deploy the tank-buster missile from his arm (it's sticking out but not yet launched before he backs down), leaving the viewer to speculate what damage it could have done to him. This is all a very clever way to both show that Thor is an impossibly powerful badass while still hinting that he's not invulnerable to everything. I do believe Thor was a little bloodied by the end of Ultron as well.   I think Supes could use some of this de-powering. Make him hard as fuck to kill and really fast and super strong, but still somewhat vulnerable to heavy weaponry. Say what you will about Superman III, but there's a scene in which Supes is struck by a homing missile, and it knocks him unconscious for a few minutes and you worry about him a little bit."
RedLetterMedia,3cy0ca,KUARL,3,Sun Jul 12 07:28:26 2015 UTC,"I haven't read them either, but my understanding is that Batman wants to kill Superman for causing 9/11 but Superman has no interest in killing Batman. Which makes the whole ""versus"" thing kind of confusing. Unless they're settling their differences with a chess match."
RedLetterMedia,3cy0ca,OnBenchNow,3,Sat Jul 11 22:27:09 2015 UTC,Oh maybe like Superman killing Batman would have the world truly turn on Superman.
RedLetterMedia,3cy0ca,crunchybug,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:28:07 2015 UTC,"at least once in the comics he had some kryptonite in or around his suit, I remember reading one where he got a guy to shoot a kryptonite arrow at Supes and dude still caught it before it hit him"
RedLetterMedia,3cy0ca,uncoolaidman,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:57:04 2015 UTC,"Superman will always have a  massive handicap, and Batman fans will conveniently forget that fact. It will always also end with Superman just knocked out or deciding to stop fighting and Batman with every bone in his body broken.  His most famous victory was in the alternate universe story The Dark Knight Returns (which heavily inspired this movie). In it, Superman is literally nuked by a third party, and then is unwilling to attack Batman for fear of hurting him. Then Green Arrow shoots Superman with a kryptonite arrow, and Batman punches him a few times. As soon as Superman decides to fight for real, Batman fakes a heart attack and ends the battle.  So naturally everyone uses this as an example of Batman beating Superman in a 1 on 1 fight."

RedLetterMedia,3cy0ca,Defengar,2,Sun Jul 12 00:07:03 2015 UTC,I actually thought Ultron was fairly well done as well as Loki.  Zod made no sense to me. Why was he going to earth if he could just colonize Mars instead? I don't think MoS established why Zod would not be a competent leader or would make crazy decisions (unlike in the Donner version when his ego-maniacalness is intrinsic to the character)
RedLetterMedia,3cy0ca,My_name_is_Jaime,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:29:53 2015 UTC,"1.) They needed the codex which was on Earth.  2.) The machine teraforms planets, but if that planet doesn't have all the materials needed for making the place habitable to Kryptonians and other life, the process likely can't be done. Mars is half the size of Earth and due to that has far less available resources to work with.  Also Mars has a dead core, which is why it has almost no atmosphere anymore. I doubt the teraforming machine can fix that issue.  Mercury and Venus, the only other two solid planets, are both living hells. To close to the sun, or to geologically unstable to make a habitation attempt (both are also smaller than Earth). That only leaves Earth.  And of course it is very likely his military oriented mind subconsciously perceived humans as a threat, even if they were currently very weak compared to his race."

Look at all the previous actors who played Batman, all of them looked scrawny and lanky in the suit, even Bale, who was his physical toughest in all three films, looked oddly thin.   Their voices were all either too soft or too high, and George Clooney is the only one who had the classic Bat Chin.  Batman in the comics is built like a tank, has a buttchin the size of Peter Griffon and a rich, deep, gravelly voice of Kevin Conroy. Affleck so far fits two of them, and it's possible he could do justice to the third.   Batman is primarily a physical character, he is supposed to be intimidating in every way, even in a big dumb costume, and so far Affleck is the best looking portrayal.  We just have to wait and see the full film to decide for real."

And then super-intense chorus.  This film looks just like Man of Steel; A movie that has absolutely no joy or fun put into it. Just an endless series of dumb, boring action. I mean, come on. Your movie has Versus in the title, that's pretty goofy as-is, don't try to dress it up in a fancy suit and claim it's THE MOVIE TO END MOVIES.  And watching through all the footage, why does Superman look like such a huge prick? There's not a single shot of him not looking super-intense frownyface >:(. That's not the look of a guy that you're supposed to be sympathetic towards, that's the look of a man that's going to ask you for $20 because he loaned you a quarter the other day.  This looks like it's going to be a 4 hour long slog of angsty dialogue and over-the-top levels of CGI destruction. Man of Steel 2: Steel Harder anyone? Maybe I'll be wrong, maybe it'll be a good movie. That'd be nice. But...C'mon, Zack Snyder's track record alone gives reason to be hesitant."
RedLetterMedia,3cy0ca,FattimusSlime,13,Sat Jul 11 21:10:36 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I don't really mind that these movies are taking themselves so seriously because Marvel films don't at all, and after seeing the same movie 10 times in a row of consequence-free action shlock loaded for bare with Whedonesque quips I'm kind of feeling a little bit more open to this than expected.  At the very least I'd say that it's more visually interesting and arresting than anything I saw in the Ultron trailers"
RedLetterMedia,3cy0ca,SiegmeyerofCatarina,7,Sun Jul 12 02:56:27 2015 UTC,"Nah absolutely you're right with that. But there's a point where your film becomes this unenjoyable, grey, concrete thing, like Man of Steel was. It had some cool ideas to it but it was...Soulless? I guess would be the best way to describe how I felt the movie was. There was no reverence of the character, no care given to the audience that Superman came from. He didn't have to be a wacky slapstick ""Women belong in the kitchen, Jimmy! :)"" type, but is there a single scene in the entire film where he doesn't have a furrowed brow and half a scowl?  Not that they should be full-goofball mode but the old Justice League or the Batman/Superman animated series had some pretty serious story going on. Some silly shit too (Like the episode where Wonder Woman was turned into a pig, even though that episode was awesome), but plenty of dark ones too.  Marvel on the other hand has kind of gone this weird route where they went ehhhhhhhhhh fuck it let's make it silly! And I somewhat enjoy the more lighthearted aspects of those films, they ultimately feel a bit silly ""See it and forget it"" types. They don't stick with you like The Dark Knight or for the best example of not over-seriousing but still not being a slapstick comedy: The first two X-men movies.  Admittedly I probably have a weird perspective on it, I'm not really into comic books or anything, though I do like the whole idea some of them have. My favorite comic book movies (in no particular order) would be Hellboy 1 & 2, X-men 1 & 2, The Dark Knight, and The Rocketeer."
RedLetterMedia,3cy0ca,Wonkowich,2,Sun Jul 12 03:15:55 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with the first 2 X-Men films, and to a certain extent First Class/Days of Future Past really struck that increasingly rare balance of fun and substance.

I feel like Afflecks insistence on rewrites is a promising sign"
RedLetterMedia,3cy0ca,JMUDukes1750,2,Sun Jul 12 17:20:41 2015 UTC,"That could be, it's kind of weird to say but his inclusion into the film may be its redeeming aspect. Like or dislike him, there's no denying that Affleck is a comic nerd who loves the medium, which is strangely rare to see.  First Class and Days were weird movies for me because I really liked parts of them and really couldn't stand others. And I don't mean ""This one scene's dumb"", I mean ""This whole 1/4th of the movie is blegh."". I didn't have that with the first two X-men movies. God they were just really fuckin good movies. :<"
RedLetterMedia,3cy0ca,bigblackcouch,3,Sun Jul 12 17:42:45 2015 UTC,"I would say Winter Soldier hit the perfect spot as far as tone goes.  It takes itself seriously enough without feeling over-the-top grimdark like Man of Steel and Dawn of Justice looks, and its moments of levity don't run against the overall tone of the movie.  It feels like a comic book movie, but still gives weight to the dark stuff happening around them, which is something I feel like even most of the other MCU movies don't get right.  I even think the Half in the Bag review for Winter Soldier described it as a better Superman movie than Man of Steel."

RedLetterMedia,3cy0ca,Rick_Tobberman,5,Sun Jul 12 05:48:49 2015 UTC,"He barely had any lines in Man of Steel. Superman really only spoke when spoken to. It was a major weakness of the film for me - he had very little character of his own and only reacted to what other people did throughout the film.   For sharp contrast, reference the Sam Raimi Spiderman films. Peter Parker feels like a real guy who does everyday stuff, and you can relate to him as a human being as a result. He was Peter Parker first and Spiderman second. It's the same with all the primary Marvel characters, too. It feels much more natural to use the name Tony Stark rather than calling him Iron Man, because they've created a great human character in Tony and 'Iron Man' is just the nickname he goes by as a hero. Tony Stark has a real personality, and foibles, and a distinguishable attitude.  Superman and Clark Kent and Kal-El are the same featureless slate. He has zero personality and is little more than a walking archetype.   You know what I'd love to see in Batman vs. Superman? A scene where Clark Kent stands in line at Taco Bell or wherever and orders a bean burrito. Or maybe he's driving home from his job at the Planet and accidentally rear-ends somebody at a red light and he and the other driver have to exchange insurance information. Or maybe he gets talked into going out to a bar with some friends, and meets a girl that is pretty hot, and they start to talk, but she gets too drunk and ends up throwing up on his shoes and he does the gentlemanly thing and flies her home safely and tucks her in, and the next couple of days he gets voicemails from her but he's too shy to answer or call her back.

RedLetterMedia,3cy0ca,EDJE,5,Sat Jul 11 22:49:14 2015 UTC,"You probably don't care, but in The Dark Knight Returns comic, an older Bruce Wayne does ""beat"" superman in a mech suit.

And then Batman barely won, and ""died"" from a heart attack right after."

Snyder does lofty photography, with nicely setup establishing shots. But he is not a brilliant filmmaker. He only does it because he knows how to use the tools and because it looks cool. There's no deeper reasoning behind his directorial decisions.  BvS looks like ""retcon: the movie"" where he is backpedaling on a lot of BS that he got call on from MoS, to now snidely claim it wasn't a roided out movie full of stupid. But he is bound to make new stupid on this movie. The trailer looked great, but that as much as Snyder can coherently direct: Lofty, vague trailers."

The sheer cynicism shown by many movie goers is a real downer these days, it's one thing to criticise a film, and another to rip it apart without full context or even full consideration.   I love Batman, and I appreciate Superman, I also adore Dark Knight Returns, both the comic and the animated adaptation, so I'm going into this film with optimism, if it is half as good as that, I'll be happy. Even if it Dark Knight Rises level of problems, i'll still have enjoyed it.  Though Eisenberg is not going to work, I am calling it now, he looks weak, sounds weaker and the two lines he's uttered so far have been an amazing line ruined by his voice and an idiotic line ruined by being idiotic.   Ever since someone mentioned it, I have wanted to see The Rock play Lex Luthor. Nothing will ever live up to that fantasy."

RedLetterMedia,3cz3m7,fatty_fatshits,3,Sun Jul 12 03:29:40 2015 UTC,"I think this is accurate. Mike cites the Dominion War as the downfall of Star Trek, when it became about war and action and shit like that.  I watched the Prelude vid, its quality surprised me, but in no way could I consider that ""Star Trek,"" more like ""Vague Naval War Story.""   I guess my point is- do we really need a visual representation of how the Federation broke the back of the Empire? We get it, it happened. TNG was a perfect spin-off and doesn't need a prequel or lead in.  The fans want good (sci-fi) stories, not dumb action."

Only Indonesia could take a Javanese water deity and combine it with a Terminator ripoff.  I think they ran Lost in Dinosaur World on Fox affiliates the year Jurassic Park came out. It was crap then, and worse now.  [edit] There are a lot of Leo Fong (""Low Blow"") fans on IMdB, and they love Low Blow because of how cheap the movie is, and how much a ""slob with a heart of gold"" Fong's character is.

RedLetterMedia,3cy3cz,fatty_fatshits,7,Sat Jul 11 20:41:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, biggest problem with Man of Steel was writing. Dialog was bad, characters were bad, script flow was bad. At the budget level of these movies I'm not sure if Snyder could throw it all out and make his own movie. I'm not sure if any director can.  After Man of Steel, I was sure that this would be another borefest of 45 minutes of punching people with no character development, but the beginning of the trailer the part where you watch the MoS events from Bruce Wayne's eyes was actually pretty cool. The rest was pretty meh though, I wasn't excited, I wasn't bored, I was just indifferent."

I think Dawn of the Dead 2004 is better than the original, 300 is a cool flick, Watchmen is one of the best cape flicks despite it largely missing the point of the comic, Owls of Ga'Hoole was a neato movie for kids that got away with a fair bit of brutality, Sucker Punch was just fucking awful, I didn't like Man of Steel but appreciate that Snyder of all people learned that a fight scene has far more weight if you don't constantly slow it down, and therefore I have to remain optimistic about SvB. Four good movies out of six is a damn fine record in my books.  I always think he represents the worst kind of hack fraudulence in hollywood until I realise he actually doesn't. I think he legitimately gives a shit about the movies he makes and isn't lazy or money-focused at all.  As for developing the characters in SvB, I think it would be refreshing to not have to fuck around with origin stories and alter egos too much.

Eh. You'll see this a lot when someone publishes an article about some obscure work in a general interest journal. It's annoying, but also easy to breeze past if you're already familiar with what the author is looking at. Remember, you do have to write for your audience. (Though, I do agree that it's annoying and fucks up the flow of the paper overall.)   How can you get something published with no apparent central thesis? Is that what all literary analysis papers are?    There's a thesis; it's just not spelled out in a ""my paper is about ..."" line. The larger problem is that the author doesn't really do much to build on what they highlight. The paper just feels like a small analysis surrounded by a lot of summarization and namedropping.   The article is really unfocused. I know what the author is trying to say, but I feel like this could be a much more interesting paper if he had dedicated more time to modern transmedia criticism, fan culture, and Star Wars' cultural influence overall instead of just leaving it all as a brief mention in the last page or two (which also includes large block quotes and a lengthy conclusion...)."

A lot of people on this sub bitch about Jack/Rich's lack of skill. I have no problem with them sucking, as long as they're taking the game at face value. One of my favorite streams was when the Idle Thumbs guys played Crusader Kings II. They had absolutely no idea to play, and never really got much better but they took the playthrough seriously. They also listened to the stream's advice (which was often totally wrong, making the whole thing even more fun to watch)."

When Pre-Rec involved more Jay and Jessi hanging out and goofing around with games, it was a blast. Now it's these two hapless turds refusing to learn or understand anything before deciding that it's awful or not for them. It's not even a ""they don't like what a I like"" thing, it's their deeply flawed and juvenile process.  Compare their takes on things to a more informed and nuanced approach, like the guys from Funhaus (formerly Inside Gaming on Machinima) and it's just embarrassing. Even when that crew disagrees about a game, they can have a great back and forth about it. Jack just has insane, arbitrary and steadfast rules about enjoyability that are simply baffling to comprehend.  tldr: Pre-Rec sucks and I'm glad I stopped giving them money. If you want your gaming personalities to not drive you insane just watch Funhaus instead."

RedLetterMedia,3cribq,Bokthand,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:14:17 2015 UTC,"I'm probably in the minority too but I actually enjoy watching Jack fail at gaming and hearing Rich get more frustrated as it goes on.  On the Mordor stream you had a massive button prompt taking up the entire middle screen with Jack going ""I don't know what I'm supposed to do!!"" which I found hilarious. Then he starts to get to grips with the game and you can see him learn as he plays. Sure he misses some obvious stuff but that's part of the fun for me.  I also disagree with some of the comments about their lack of gaming knowledge at least on Rich's part. He mentions GTA, Deus Ex, Half Life, X- Com, Batman games, FTL etc so he does know gaming but they seem to play a certain type of game on streams. I would like to see them play some more GTA5 story, Deus Ex original and HR or if you're going retro then Fallout 1 & 2.  I guess maybe it's because I'm near Rich's age I get the cynicism he has for modern gaming."

They don't like or understand such a large portion of games that Pre Rec becomes pointless, its just a litany of complaints and nostalgia for the 80's and 90's. I gave up on Pre Rec after their last horrible E3 episode when they provided almost no meaningful coverage or insight (beyond making fun of the head of Xbox whom they knew nothing about) and said they didn't care about Bethesda so they wouldn't talk about Fallout 4 at all. It's good to show contempt for your audience."

I would love to explain to them why it is the way it is, and what VATS actually is, and why it's in the game.

I hope he fucking shuts the fuck up for once, and let Rich, Rich's wife, Jay talk. He is kind bearable when he talks about something with other people(mostly movies). End of rant, I had to vent it.  And his fucking insistence on using a controller. Why? Because he is so used to casual console games(or autoaim in fps) that he can't use mouse? What does he use to edit his 'hilarious' videos? Controller? What is he, retarded? Can't he realise that some things have to be played with mouse and keyboard? Would he play Dota 2 or Starcraft 2 with a controller? Fucking aidsmoby."

And his attempts to be funny are more ""haha funny"" and less ""weird funny"". And I assume that a large percentage of RLM fans decided to watch stuff beyond Plinkett reviews exactly because they were into the rainy-day, permanently-unhappy sense of humor of Mike, Jay and Rich, and Jack is the furthest you can have from that. I dunno, that's just my best explanation to a question that maybe only I want answered.  So in conclusion, Mailman Tommy was the greatest casting choice in the history of the world."

RedLetterMedia,3cbhmd,iswantingcake,5,Mon Jul 6 19:50:13 2015 UTC,"I would argue it is.  I feel like it is just like the current state of video games.  You now have studios that pump out a new movie every year.  And people buy into it on name alone.    The issue is that the overhead on these huge machines of people/talent is so big the movies need to make hundreds of millions to break even.    I think Marvel will go first, either that or Star Wars.  One of these franchises will make a turd that even the masses won't go out and see, leading to the brand being harmed.    Once this happens you have potentially like 4 or 5 big movies set up to fail that they have already invested a ton into.  The big feature industry will crash like a ton of bricks.  Only then will it change."

It's comedy for a very specific market (10-13 year old, and he knows it), and he pumps these things out constantly.

His audience includes older teens and even people in their early to mid 20's, I know plenty of people at my college who watch him, especially women, and I can't wrap my mind around it.   The difference with RLM is that they make humorous and in depth reviews of films from the prospective of film makers. It's more than just someone's exaggerated reactions to something on a screen."

Then we have Return of the Jedi, with ewoks and Han Solo, decisions that are purely based on marketing and toys (like JarJar). That movie was only saved because it wasn't directed by George and it banked on the Star Wars golden era.  If Return of the Jedi was released in 1999 in place of Phantom Menace, and George had directed it, reception would've been the exactly the same as the Phantom Menace."

RedLetterMedia,3c7ewq,NutmegJared,8,Mon Jul 6 13:08:03 2015 UTC,"If Return of the Jedi was released in 1999 in place of Phantom Menace, and George had directed it, reception would've been the exactly the same as the Phantom Menace.   I have to emphasize this part:   If Return of the Jedi was released in 1999 in place of Phantom Menace, and George had directed it, reception would've been the exactly the same as the Phantom Menace.   ROTJ is still a good movie, but let's not forget that it was directed by Richard Marquand. If George hadn't forced Han Solo and Ewoks in, it might've been a much better movie. Probably would've been the best movie in the series if Irvin Kershner had directed it."
RedLetterMedia,3c7ewq,bothanspy1337,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:16:29 2015 UTC,"I have been rewatching the movies with my kids.    IMO Empire is over rated.  The Dagobah stuff is cool, but a bit slow.  I never really stopped and thought about it but the entire half of the movie with Han and Leah in the Falcon doesn't really involve anything interesting.    I mean the stakes in Empire are not all really that high when you think about it.  Luke trains, and the others just fly around a bit.    I much prefer most of Jedi, I have always liked the beginning with them saving Han, and the final dual is IMO the best part of Star Wars.  The entire first Trilogy built to that confrontation with the Emporer and it pays off great.    Ewoks are a bit silly, but are such a small part of the movie compared to Jar Jar in Phantom Menace."
RedLetterMedia,3c7ewq,FamousAndy,13,Mon Jul 6 13:50:00 2015 UTC,Man...it really feels like George waited until the last fucking moment to write the prequels. Like he had absolutely no idea how this kid should react...cause he wrote the scene the previous week on the back of a sears catalog or something.

RedLetterMedia,3c7ewq,Cyrius,7,Mon Jul 6 00:53:08 2015 UTC,"He was never very clear on where the story started.  Some sources say it begin with the prequels, some say it began with A New Hope.  The Secret History of Star Wars, a really great book that attempts to answer questions like that, pieced together that his 12-part master document-manuscript-thing started with a very rough version of what would turn into A New Hope.  I believe he also says in that scene that he knew who the main characters were and where they were going, but he couldn't figure out how to get them together and lead them from one part to the next.

The movie start off with action star Leo Fong as a down and out cop who is approaching the end of his career, when he stumbles on to a big case that involves corruption, black mail and murder. This is where the killings start. From start finish Fong delivers in this must see action caper. This movie also co-stars Richard Roundtree.

RedLetterMedia,3bsh7x,Kestyr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:01:21 2015 UTC,I watched it twice because i thought i'd missed something (and to make notes). After what felt like an eternity i realised i had made a huge mistake because at that point the film takes a turn for the worse. That was with 2 hours to go. ಠ_ಠ
RedLetterMedia,3bsh7x,anarchistica,0,Fri Jul 3 14:56:36 2015 UTC,I couldn't even finish it. I watched it with my family and we were all making fun of it.

RedLetterMedia,3bsh7x,Freddie_AppsHero,0,Thu Jul 2 11:13:45 2015 UTC,"Here's my problem with it; if it was made like any other movie, switching actors and whatnot, nobody would've cared. It was a gimmick film with an awful script, terrible cinematography and really bad acting."
RedLetterMedia,3bsh7x,Paahtis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:46:13 2015 UTC,"I'll admit that I haven't seen it, but it seems to me, from what I've heard, that it's a pretty stock standard family drama, some good acting from the parents, some bad acting from the kids. It just happened to have an ambitious production technique, and that's where it gets the marks from."
RedLetterMedia,3bsh7x,Deodorant_Dan,-2,Thu Jul 2 13:56:04 2015 UTC,Somehow it sounds like you really want to hate this movie. Don't take everything the frauds say as gospel.

RedLetterMedia,3behzq,JoshuaGreen0011,3,Wed Jul 1 05:58:25 2015 UTC,There are so many laugh out loud moments imo. After about half way through the movie I lost all hope and just had fun laughing at all the insane shit happening.
RedLetterMedia,3behzq,Daveaa005,6,Sun Jun 28 18:59:37 2015 UTC,"They didn't detract from the movie for me. I saw it after watching the HITB episode and so I was just expecting it to be fun, and not have any actual drama or relationship exploration like the original had."
RedLetterMedia,3behzq,JoshuaGreen0011,-2,Sun Jun 28 19:06:42 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, but it's in the same category as like Furious 7 in terms of just one-dimensional characters and insane shit going on screen. That makes a movie fun, not good."

It was so poorly written and executed that I couldn't truly enjoy it. When I say just because it's fun doesn't mean it's good I mean the fact I couldn't suspend my disbelief and become anywhere near immersed in the world is a product of how sloppily put together it was pieced together. Again, all in my opinion. If you really felt it was super rad, that's fine. I just couldn't even come close to actually liking this. I feel like nostalgia has a huge grasp on everyone liking this movie."

I don't think it was the the comedian's fault either, she was quite clear that she didn't think the movie was amazing but it was exactly what she expected it to be and she enjoyed that type of movie. Mike seemed to keep pushing that it was just a bad movie without any redeeming quality though.  Usually I agree with Mike on most movies, but this time I think he was being a little hard on it."
RedLetterMedia,3behzq,crunchybug,3,Mon Jun 29 06:28:02 2015 UTC,"I agree. Mike was too hard not on the movie, but the audience of that movie (including that attractive woman they were talking to). I think it's wrong to ever look down on someone because of their taste in movies/music/etc."

RedLetterMedia,3bc27w,dfscha1402,4,Sun Jun 28 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's odd from a business prospective that they haven't put out more Plinkett reviews, even at the pace of one every six months to a year. It's still the most popular and well known RLM production and how most people discover RLM."
RedLetterMedia,3bc27w,iansarmy1,15,Sun Jun 28 00:37:38 2015 UTC,Because they're smart enough to realize the quality is better than quantity and that if they overuse Plinkett the novelty will wear off and no one will care when the 87th Plinkett Review comes out.
RedLetterMedia,3bc27w,killmachine91,3,Sun Jun 28 00:55:39 2015 UTC,"That still leaves 86 reviews of pure profit, though. It would be a good business decision to make more reviews. Not sure why they don't."
RedLetterMedia,3bc27w,FriendlyPirate,3,Sun Jun 28 12:04:42 2015 UTC,"I actually got the opportunity to speak with Jim (Canadian VFX artist who guest starred in a couple best of the worsts but of course you know that already amirite) about the times he has spent with the RLM crew. Here's a lovely picture of us! Anyways, I actually asked about the Plinkett reviews and he (Jim) mentioned two main things: First, that Mike is a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to things like editing and making high quality videos, and second that he doesn't really like making the Plinkett videos because they are far more of a pain in the ass than their other shows in terms of shooting/collecting footage, creating props, writing scripts, recording vocal tracks, enlisting other actors (in the case of the Star Wars reviews), and editing. Kinda makes sense as the Plinkett vids are clearly a lot more intricate in terms of their editing than, say, an episode of half in the bag in which they can basically just get a couple of guys together to sit down for a while and chat. Take this with a grain of salt of course as it didn't come from Mike himself but I'd say Jim is at the very least a relatively credible source."
RedLetterMedia,3bc27w,SkepticalPanda,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:06:44 2015 UTC,"Like I said, because they're smart. The Plinkett character draws in tons of views because it's informative and they don't oversaturate it. If they did, one Plinkett review wouldn't matter because 86 other ones came out the same year. It would ultimately lead to less viewers because people would get burned out from it and it wouldn't be special at that point. Sort of like how BK always takes their fucking chicken fries off the menu."

RedLetterMedia,3bc27w,killmachine91,2,Sun Jun 28 12:40:41 2015 UTC,"I never said they should churn them out one on top the other, just that a few between 2012 and now would have been nice and kept people interested in Plinkett and brought more viewers to their other shows. Like Star Trek:ITD was begging for a take down."
RedLetterMedia,3bc27w,iansarmy1,0,Sun Jun 28 21:10:57 2015 UTC,"I know what you're saying, but Mike usually only does the reviews when he feels like it, so it's up to him to decide when he wants to make one. Also, I think RLM looks at it in the long term - in business, if they oversaturate it or just make them consistently every 6 months or year, people will get bored because there won't be a novelty to them and they'll feel like one is the same as the other, which was my point"

I almost registered at their forum to ask why the rest weren't but that was too much work.  Hurray!  I didn't do anything and everything worked out anyways!
RedLetterMedia,3b7ft1,YourMumsPal,12,Fri Jun 26 16:27:43 2015 UTC,"The guys have a little more energy in a lot of these older episodes. They're more in depth than current uploads and they agree on more discussion points that are raised during their conversation, often coming to the same conclusion about the movies.  I suppose it was still kind of a new endeavour for them and a lot of their talking points and ideas were fresh but they definitely seem more enthusiastic and willing to get into details with their criticism.  More recent episodes are still good but I can almost always predict the outcome and they sort of gloss over many key discussion points these days like the film maker's intentions, themes or cinematic style. They definitely seem to have grown weary of modern movies and are less eager to explore them for too long. Their editing skills have really improved too, of course, which may just make newer episodes seem slicker and better condensed overall.  I don't think the quality has declined much or that the guys are simply phoning it in but seeing those old episodes again has made me wonder if they might be growing fed up of doing reviews now or if their relationship has maybe even grown more distant."
RedLetterMedia,3b7ft1,biz20,7,Sat Jun 27 02:09:47 2015 UTC,"I find their newer stuff to be funnier but their older stuff to be more insightful. I wish they would do something like the Jack and Jill episode again. That was brilliant. Not to sound like a douche demanding for shit, but aren't they getting payed more now for this? We should see more Jack and Jill type reviews more often, but whatever, still great content."
RedLetterMedia,3b7ft1,YourMumsPal,2,Sat Jun 27 14:10:18 2015 UTC,"They don't make a great deal of money, to be honest. It's all fan driven and most of it goes straight back into production. You can google the company's earnings."

RedLetterMedia,3axi2m,killmachine91,0,Thu Jun 25 00:05:35 2015 UTC,It's not hard to pinpoint it when it was doomed from the start. From 1994 to 2005 it was all in the shitter
RedLetterMedia,3axi2m,nameless22,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:34:17 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand. By pinpoint I refer to the exact moment when there was no turning back: SW was going to be ruined. Sure the writing was on the wall the moment Lucas drafted TPM but things still could have been salvaged. That documentary showed you in real time the moment it was too late and permanently fucked. Or at the very least, you knew THEY knew it was fucked before the rest of us did (which honestly wasn't until AotC, considering TPM as just an oddity that hopefully would be improved upon in the sequel)."
RedLetterMedia,3axi2m,killmachine91,0,Fri Jun 26 23:57:22 2015 UTC,"Haha oh, didn't get what you meant exactly.

RedLetterMedia,3axi2m,nameless22,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:01:02 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, I didn't realize it was on their official channel (I saw it but someone else uploaded it I think). Well, in George's mind Anakin/Padme is a perfect love story and Greedo shot first, so maybe he doesn't see the movie as true negative spin. Which is ironic, since the documentary does more to show you how much the movie was going to suck more than any of the big movie critics.

RedLetterMedia,3ap7ow,MisterRoku,9,Mon Jun 22 11:21:53 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting documentary, I like Star Wars but I was never really in touch with the fan culture, I didn't realize so many people despised Lucas over the prequels and the special editions. It does however kind of side with the obsessive super fans, instead of taking a step back and saying these people are kind of weird and maybe should take Star Wars a little less seriously. There is also a side of the fan base who blindly love the prequels and anything with the Star Wars name on it, and they get pretty irate when someone criticizes any part of Star Wars. I've found quite a few of them on Reddit."
RedLetterMedia,3ap7ow,iansarmy1,6,Mon Jun 22 13:56:34 2015 UTC,"Then again, to play devil's advocate, aren't all nerdoms and fanbases like that too?   Star Trek probably has a more devout fanbase than Star Wars at times.   It's great to have interests and loves in life, but there's always a faction of the fanbase that takes it way too far.   I've also heard that Doctor Who fans are the most rabid and irrational online."
RedLetterMedia,3ap7ow,iansarmy1,3,Mon Jun 22 13:59:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah of course they all have their subsets of fans who go too far and become obnoxious to the rest of the fan base. Leonard Nimoy received piles of erotic letters addressed to Spock for years and one time a woman came up to him and asked him to heal her sick child. My point is that the documentary focuses too much on a smaller subset of Star Wars fans, when they run a huge gamut from people like my mom who saw all of the movies once or twice and thought Jar Jar was funny, to the commander of your local 501st unit."

I think it was during their Samurai Cop commentary track where Jay pointed out that good schlock isn't planned, it just happens. RedLetterMedia is, IMHO, really well planned schlock and it's hilarious.  Mike's editing of BotW is masterful (even when he screws up it lends itself to what they're doing) and HitB is extremely well cut - the clips are all the perfect size - even their ""acting"" for the VCR repair guys is spot on.  RLM is all about quality - it may look like crap but do you think it's easy to make good looking crap?"
RedLetterMedia,39zq3x,Supermunch2000,6,Wed Jun 17 20:57:09 2015 UTC,"They're getting $12,000 a month from Patreon and probably a couple thousand from YouTube, in addition to merchandise and whatever else they sell on the site. This is based on the content that they already have. With such a steady supply of revenue, they can get away with being a bit lenient. I'm sure there is also enough to provide the main members a modest income and fund whatever projects they're working on."
RedLetterMedia,39zq3x,nerdoldnerdith,8,Tue Jun 16 17:10:56 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, Rich doesn't do editing or post stuff so it's pretty much two people doing the work. Space Cop is apparently special effects heavy so that's been taking up tons of time, Jay talks abou it on Pre-Rec sometimes.  Their output in 2014 was pretty steady so I'm guessing after Space Cop is done it'll go back to normal."
RedLetterMedia,39zq3x,SparkTR,5,Tue Jun 16 06:43:04 2015 UTC,"$12,000 isn't really that much money. Living wages for at least three full-time employees plus rental costs for whatever space they're using, associated costs for anyone else they get help from at fair rates... it all starts to add up pretty quickly.

Jessie seems to work in the office), plus rent, paying for any freelancers etc.   Remember something like BotW is hours and hours of footage that has to be edited down into a short episode that takes time. I think you're underestimating  the amount of work it takes to put together their videos. Others either have a ton of staff or do everything from their home studio with very little original writing or editing."

RedLetterMedia,39z736,wierdaaron,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:25:43 2015 UTC,"I don't remember, but I think it was an older episode. Maybe someone else has a link.  I don't really see it as that bad provided it isn't used in a way that is meant to be directly demeaning to gay people, and it is used in the right place. On 4chan it's pretty much part of the culture so I'm not going to bother calling them out on it, and using it behind closed doors with friends who you know are alright with it isn't really a big deal either IMO (once again as long as you're not using it to hate on gay people). But I agree that it shouldn't be used with people you don't know very well, and that it feels out of place here.  On another note, Rich Evans used the term ""tranny"" in the Alienator BOTW episode, which is a slur on par with ""faggot"" from what I've heard. However, a lot of people don't even realize it's offensive so I think we can maybe give him the benefit of the doubt on that one. Also it was used in the context of a joke in a way that didn't seem overly offensive, though it also didn't really make much sense and came out of no where, and all the others on the panel just seemed confused when he said it."

I'd like to think that RLM's reach is wider than just chan kids, and I'd like to be able to continue recommending it to wider audiences of people without having to worry.  Something like YMS I have to be careful about who I suggest to, because he uses a lot of chan language and references that I wouldn't expect someone to tolerate unless they grew up online and know the deal with that stuff. The RLM boys don't really strike me as chan types, though I know they have a bit of a following on 4chan."

RedLetterMedia,39tutq,PortIslandStation,7,Mon Jun 15 11:07:10 2015 UTC,Mike has been working on new review (I presume) for the past 97 years. So even if this is Plinkett material like you claim - it'll be a while before anything is done about it. I do think it will be on Half in the Bag.  There's also new Star Wars. If both new Star Treks got a Plinkett treatment - I'd expect that one to get as well. So Jurassic World is pushed even further.

RedLetterMedia,39tutq,doyle871,11,Mon Jun 15 20:28:41 2015 UTC,"Well it just made 500 million dollars on its opening weekend, so expect multiple sequels of diminishing quality. Btw, I haven't seen the movie and probably never will, the formulaic summer blockbuster has become its own genre and it doesn't interest me at all.    Connection to an older generation of filmmakers that exposes their faults as they age. Spielberg served as executive producer   I will say that I don't agree with this. Spielberg never forgot how to make films and he his still very capable of directing smaller, character driven films (have you seen Lincoln?).  But, he also really likes money so he's involved in a lot of these ""popcorn"" movies."
RedLetterMedia,39tutq,iansarmy1,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:59:29 2015 UTC,"Lincoln is a very good movie, and I am kind of interested in checking out Spielberg's adaption of the BFG, even though it's way down the line. You're right that Spielberg hasn't forgot how to make a quality film, and it would foolish of me to insist that just because an older director makes something that it doesn't have value (I mean, just look at Martin Scorsese's work! Hugo and Wolf of Wall Street are both great, and I'm pumped to check out Silence, which is also way down the line). Spielberg was also at more of a distance from this project as an executive producer. But as someone who still knows how to make a good film, I would have hoped he could have guided it better.  All in all, it's a weird year for Spielberg fans, with studios returning to two of his biggest properties, Jurassic Park and Poltergeist. Maybe he needs to allow that now to finance projects he wants to work on, like Bridge of Spies, which, despite Spielberg serving as the director, a screenplay by the Coen brothers, Tom Hanks as the star, and an October release date, is a movie I had never heard of until today when I looked through Spielberg's filmography after reading your comment. Sucks that that's what it's come to, doesn't it? I guess I'll check out the trailer to Bridge of Spies."

And I don't hate Shyamalan, The Sixth Sense is still a great movie for me and although I don't like Unbreakable as many people do, it's a very solid film and features his best directing. Signs has tons of good things, if that movie had a better ending, it would be considered a classic. But everything from The Village onwards has just been terrible."

I always thought the popular opinion of plinkett doing the matrix sequels was kind of weird too because it doesn't seem like Mike cares about them and they were mostly just messy (as far as I remember).

RedLetterMedia,39tutq,bothanspy1337,11,Sun Jun 14 19:02:30 2015 UTC,"Jurassic World was simply the worst movie I've watched all year.   I went into it without knowing it's just a popcorn film; had I know that going into it, I would have had more fun. Yes, I took the movie too seriously, I thought it would have acting at least on par with the first three movies.  LEAVE YOUR BRAIN AT HOME FOLKS!  SPOILERS BELOW:   (just leave your brain at home and you'll love it - the CGI is great, I mean really great. The scene of park guests kayaking past the peaceful vegetarian dinos was gorgeous. ).  Oh, there was a few intelligent moments in the movie, like Owen (Chris Pratt's) dousing himself in gasoline to cover his scent, the brothers taking the battery (and I presume gas) from the crashed jeep to rebuild the 20 year old in the ruins of the original Jurassic Park (even though that area should have been stripped bare for asset reclamation by the corporation, and not just left to rot in the jungle).  But the majority of the actors were just stereotypes, tropes and not actual characters you could empathize with. Cardboard cutouts. The only character that I could empathize with was Zach, because he actually (barely) grew as a character throughout the movie.    A dino goes missing, and you don't think to check with a drone or, hell, check the tracking beacon first before sending people inside of it's enclosure.) Claire Dearing, your stereotypical corporate operations manager, only showing empathy when looking at a wounded dino, instead of when she watched two park employees eaten alive on CCTV. After she reprimanded an operator for wearing a Jurassic Park shirt for being classless because it reminds her of people that died in the original park?! Oh right, she has two family members, she should call her assistant to find out if they are ok. Running through the jungle in fucking heels. Seriously? I guess hanging out with Chris Pratt makes you light on your feet. Comms not working to push the story further (because why would you put up cell phone repeaters on an island filled with killer dinos?). I know you are the CEO of the corporation I work for, but as the head geneticist I can't tell you what the Indominus is made from because... plot device / pacing / keeping the audience in the dark for a scene reveal. I almost expected him to say it was part human, to account for it's intelligence. Let's allow the CEO to fly the solders / security detail, even though he hasn't finished his flight quals. Lets clone flying animals so that if they escape from the dome, like when someone crashes into the dome because he's a shitty pilot untrained in combat situations, they can leave the island! We can train the raptors to be weapons! You know, like the tigers and cheetahs we current having fighting with the boys in Syria.  It's just like training K9 units, right? Hell, if it worked for Weyland Yutani, it can work for us, right? Let's torture the assistant (Zara) that Claire had watching over the boys, because, why not! It's fun letting the audience think she's going to survive ping ponging from one pterosaur to another, only to kill her with a Mosasaurus to remind the audience that it's still there (gotta show the gun if you are going to fire it, folks!). Awkward guy friendzoned when trying to be brave ""Someone has to stay behind"". Actually, no, you didn't, even though you were only used to open a pen (that could be opened by external access, like the Indominus had). I know I have a gun in my hand, and a raptor just jumped in front of me, but I won't shoot it because I was his trainer... even though it's already killed several of my coworkers I think it can be trusted. Totally. You should help me little buddy, because I have opposable thumbs and can remove the harness from your head, unlike the obviously alpha beast that can communicate in your language (that it knows from being raised in solitary confinement). Let's put the T-rex pen 1 block away from the central mall.  Claire  can outrun a T-rex in heels! Thank goodness exposition boy gave her the idea that we needed more teeth. Even though the T-rex is almost dead, and under the claws of the Indominus, let's get a rebound of energy once of the raptors attacks to help put the Indominus closer to the pool (I'm surprised a guest hadn't already been killed by jumping into the pool, because people can be idiots at theme parks). Let's have a Deus ex machina ending, because, well, the movie is running long. Plus, we need to fire Chekov's gun, after showing it off when we killed Zara. Let's give the audience a feel good ending, along with a glimmer of hope that having their children almost die will make the parents reconsider their divorce."

I thought they could have used the camouflage ability of the Indominus Rex more.  Why did the tracking device on the Indominus Rexs have a blinking light if it's subcutaneous? Come to think of it ,why didn't they just use the tracker when the I Rex first showed as missing, Oh shit this movie fucking sucks.

It was a silly monster movie that's it it wasn't supposed to have a deep plot or even make sense, it even had several self aware moments where they took the piss out of themselves. Didn't notice any product placement, besides it's meant to be attraction park with dino's there would be a massive amount of product placement in that scenario.  It's nowhere near as bad as the prequels or Crystal Skull just due to the fact it is at least fun.  I swear there's a ton of people who go read up about the bad points before going and then spend the entire film looking for as many of them as possible. I go to see a film I tune out and enjoy it, I'm not trying to be RLM lite."
RedLetterMedia,39tutq,MashMango,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:25:24 2015 UTC,"I dunno, you bring up some valid points, and I haven't seen the movie yet, but from what I've gathered from people telling me about it, it's not really intended to be anything more than a shallow but enjoyable blockbuster hit. I feel like it's a little unfair to compare it to the original Jurassic park, because it's not trying to be the genre-revolutionizing film the original was.  You also bring up the poor CGI, but just about everyone I've heard from disagrees with you and thinks the CGI is phenomenal. I get that there's some level of subjectivity as to what constitutes ""good"" effects, but it's not universally panned effects like they were in the kingdom of the crystal skull. Might be harder to cherry pick something that isn't as black and white as some of the other plinkett victims.  Additionally, I feel like all the points you bring up would even better apply to the upcoming terminator movie, and that one might be an even better choice, since it gives the RLM crew a plethora of bad movies to draw parallels to, as well as the extra talking point of how poorly they handle time travel and multiverse theory."
RedLetterMedia,39tutq,LazyCassiusCat,8,Sun Jun 14 19:36:59 2015 UTC,"it's not really intended to be anything more than a shallow but enjoyable blockbuster hit   That's exactly part of the problem. Mad Max: Fury Road is so great in part because it shows that you can make an exciting action movie with some thematic depth and characterization and a tight, cohesive story. Jurassic World throws all that in the garbage and it's probably going to make three or four times as much money. I really don't think it's unrealistic to have standards for action movies but people willingly accept crap and that's exactly what they get. I forget what HitB it was but Jay has some line about people watching dumb action movies and then saying ""what did you expect, it's just an action movie"" that rings pretty true here. I don't expect every action movie to be as thoroughly excellent as Fury Road but we need more movies like that or Dredd or the original Jurassic Park that are well written and have a director with a clear artistic vision driving the production forward. Jurassic World is just a horrible, uneven, tonally inconsistent mess because it was written and rewritten at least a dozen times by dozens of writers over the course of 14 years."
RedLetterMedia,39tutq,Tolgeros,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:34:07 2015 UTC,"Fair. I may have been harsh on the CGI, but there were two shots that stood out to me: the bird in the very beginning, and one part when they introduce Chris Pratt and the velociraptors. For the most part, the I. Rex looked great, and later scenes with the velociraptors. Maybe there was more of a compulsion to make the action scenes look at good as possible?  My mind also jumps to the Titanic review and its look at the practical effects in that movie that used CGI for enhancements, similar to Jurassic Park. For such a revolutionary series in regards to visual effects, it would have been nice for Jurassic World to maybe have gone the Mad Max route. sigh...  I agree with you on the Terminator, as well. I'm more well-versed in Jurassic Park-lore than Terminator, though, so maybe that's why it's easier for me to jump to that."
RedLetterMedia,39tutq,Daniel13999,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:18:27 2015 UTC,"spoilers  i went in ready to love it, and I hate to be a cynic like Mike and Rich often are, but it was disappointing. It was enjoyable enough, and Pratt is a good lead. It has some moments, and I even enjoyed the Raptor-buddies. But I agree it lost the spirit of the original and just devolved into fanboy-indulging references, rather than artistic homage.  It captured some of the wonder, but not enough. The classic theme tune was used when they get to the hotel for chuff's sake. ""Nobody cares about dinosaurs anymore."" - Oh, great. How magical. But, it did have some good sincere moments.  The product placement was a little jarring at first, but I stopped noticing towards the end. I guess it managed to engage me enough. And I appreciate that it was used for narrative reasons at some points, ie to portray the park as being over-commercialised.  In parts it's poorly written, and too many of the characters are cliched cartoon characters. Don't get me started on that love story. I was glad when the other girl had a boyfriend. I was about to loose my shit if they got together for no reason.  I actually thought the kids were good (apart from the the older one being a bit of a stereotype, but it wasn't OTT), but they just didn't get to do enough once they get back to the main resort. I was hoping they'd be in the wild for longer. Their relationship had some depth and good character development, tho it was a little simplistic at times and that ""we're brothers"" scene was so corny. And what happened to their parents divorcing? I hoped the kids would learn to accept it, but I assumed they'd just stay together. But no it was never even mentioned again. ""OK we're done with that plot device, neeeext.""  I think Jurassic Park is at its best in dense jungle, or narrow dark corridors, not in bright massive theme parks with people everywhere. The movie's fun in a superficial way, it has some good moments and Pratt is enjoyable. It becomes promising once he's introduced. I like going off-road in the ball, I like how the dino escapes, and the hunt where it camouflages (would have liked to see that again) - but sadly once they all get back together and return to the visitor centre (which happens too soon) it turns into a generic Hollywood disaster movie, with nothing particularly special about it. It can't hold a candle to the original.  But it was enjoyable, it just could have been a lot better. I mainly just didn't like the stuff in the visitor centre, and had some problems with the writing quality and pacing.  I hate to be such a moaning Myrtle about it, I almost feel bad about myself. Am I just being a hardass? Was it actually a great movie?"

Nothing fancy, just 10-15 minutes per episode why things are stupid, out of character and make little sense within that universe.

From the flames came a gratingly high pitched and almost inhuman squealing laughter, in pain they put their hands over their ears and fell prostrate on the ground. Suddenly the laughter stopped and a man appeared, rotund, prematurely balding and in ill-fitting clothes. He said to them ""You will devote your lives to making cheesy micro budget films and satirical YouTube videos, also you will give me a job."" Fearful of this mysterious figure Mike and Jay agreed and asked ""Who are you?!"" He said ""I have many names beyond counting, but you may call me Rich Evans."""

I don't think it was meant to be an actual business in the sense it is now, just simple a legal entity that would host his content.  Stuff, from what I understand, was just released sporadically whenever he made it.  It also might be what Mike and Jay do their wedding taping business through, I don't think it's ever been specified, though.  Anyways, the Plinkett reviews gained them popularity, which allowed them to make other content and eventually work at RLM full time."

Of course it's a business,  but it's the business of supporting the artist and helping them find an audience, not becoming the ""artist""  themselves.   Motion picture companies (just like record companies started doing 15 years ago)  are becoming so risk averse due to the high cost of business and lower profit margins  that they're no longer interested in supporting the vision of unestablished artists,  and will throw their money behind guaranteed hot box office properties (like Adam Sandler,  and dinosaurs)... and now even that's not enough.   They won't even greenlight a picture unless the budget gets offset with product placement.  If Spielberg was young and just getting started out today,  he'd never become an established director like he did because companies are only interested in guaranteed returns."
RedLetterMedia,39mt11,MBSquared,3,Sun Jun 14 23:57:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should read this article on the Beatles and what they taught us about business and product placement.   It's pretty clear you don't have any idea how the business of hollywood works. You seem not to grasp the idea of business or that these big production companies are in business to make money and to continue to grow. If you're talking about Paramount, Universal or Disney, of course they won't take a chance on some nobody with his nobody script. They are crafting a box-office hit. That's the fucking POINT of their business. That's the WHOLE point, if you think it's any other way, then you are delusional as all fuck. They worked very hard for many years to get to the established size that they are and they work hard now to create BIG box-office movies. That's their business model, dude. That's what they DO. I don't get thinking that Hollywood is out to make indy films that speak to your little nitch. They are in no way in that business.   They are in the business of connecting to the biggest, widest audience they can attract. If they have the rights to films such as Jurassic Park and they know it's seen as a classic, if course they'll consider re-visiting that world. Why wouldn't they? If they're in the business of staying in business and growing and developing big budget, big box-office hits, then the way they are going about it is correct. You don't create some weird film that most people will be confused by and expect it to be a winner, that's fucking stupid.  Here's the thing, YOU can get a movie made. If you have a strong script with a low budget, you can get it made. Even if it's your first script and you've never made a movie before. You can get any movie made if the budget is low enough. YES it's fucking true. Most writers try to write these huge expansive scripts and ask for 100 - 150 million budgets and get butt-hurt and write stupid stuff like ""hollywood doesn't make indy movies!"" ""They don't take chances!"" Yes they do dude but you're asking hollywood to take a chance on 150 million dollars. If you have a strong script, you can get a movie made for 150 thousand, no problem.   Adam Sandler is an established name. Like it or not. That's why big companies take big chances on him. He's famous and has had successful ROI on many of his films. He made a movie for his friends so they could all have money and retire, call him a crook, call him a piece of shit, but I think it's a pretty cool thing if a friend helped you make a few million dollars to retire with. I don't care if that's not your opinion. But I assume it's your opinion because it's Mike and Jays opinion. It's fine to enjoy opinions, but don't blindly believe people, do your own research."

RedLetterMedia,39mt11,oamh42,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:57:54 2015 UTC,"it was a lot of fun. I would also recommend it. It's basically the best parts of the other three put into a blender and taken into the extreme. It's a bit lacking in the character development side (And Bryce Dallas Howard either needed to be better directed in spots or they needed to cast someone else) and there's some stuff involving cell phone reception that I thought was silly and unnecessary , but it works enough so you care about them and unlike the other two sequels, I felt like the deaths actually had weight, even if they were over the top, the horror of them just felt more real. It's because much like the first one, you have characters who are unprepared for this situation and the movie rightfully explores that enough so you fear for them.   The tone is pretty jokey but unlike the third one, there is enough intensity to balance it. That's probably why the funny parts worked so well. As for the product placement, I think the Jack and Jill comparison is ridiculous. I can just sum it up with this question: Have you been to a theme park lately? The movie establishes that if Jurassic World existed, of course that corporations would want to jump in at the chance and influence that. Malcolm's little dialogue about putting things on a lunchbox and selling them comes true here.   If you want a straight up fun movie, this is it. I don't see anything topping this, at least for the summer."
RedLetterMedia,39mt11,ReallyNotACylon,2,Sat Jun 13 06:29:28 2015 UTC,"It's not a great comparison. The biggest example was Verizon sponsoring the new dinosaur and it's actually mocked in the film itself. The others are just stores in the park itself and didn't really bother me. Disney World has a Starbucks now, so it grounds the movie some. Stuff like that doesn't really bother me, I really only get annoyed when they basically make it a commercial for the product and keep shoving the logo in your face.   The movie was pretty enjoyable though. I went in with low expectations because nothing can live up to the original. But it's better than the other sequels and has just decent scenes."
RedLetterMedia,39mt11,airborneleaf,2,Mon Jun 15 00:00:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, if the park actually existed, that's probably what it would be like."
RedLetterMedia,39mt11,Shyamallama,2,Sat Jun 13 04:29:36 2015 UTC,"It makes it feel like a real place.

Now if the raptors had wandered in to Starbucks and drank some coffee, that's too much."
RedLetterMedia,39mt11,airborneleaf,-1,Sun Jun 14 19:41:35 2015 UTC,"I just want Mike and Jay to call a giant blockbuster film out on how retarded it is more often. I'm not talking Transformers, but things like The Hobbit, The Avengers or every superhero film now. It really annoys me when they like films like those examples but shit on films that are the exact same just with smaller budgets. How can you hate John Carter or Avatar saying the story makes no sense or is too cliche, with CGI being the main focus instead of good writing, but then say you really love Iron Man or The Avengers?  I never want to watch Jurassic World. It looks so fucking stupid and I hope Chris Pratt's career dies."

RedLetterMedia,39mt11,airborneleaf,-9,Sun Jun 14 21:43:55 2015 UTC,"Each film I listed is ALL CGI and stupid action ALL the time. They all follow the same structure; Hero is an underdog, a big CGI fight happens where he is outmatched, then he meets badass good guys, then the film grows a heart and tries to be ""emotional"", then there's a giant CGI shitfest of a battle and the hero wins (what a shock) and none of the audience is moved by any of his friends dying. They're all the same.  I still hope his career dies for being in such stupid films."
RedLetterMedia,39mt11,Ephisus,4,Fri Jun 12 22:29:11 2015 UTC,"Calling all films similar just because they follow the same basic story formula is incredibly simplistic. In that sense, Star Wars is the exact same as The Wizard of Oz or The Matrix. Avengers is focused on a group personality with wittier dialogue, and action scenes reminiscent to the comic books. Avatar is focused on the art design, 3D, and the atmosphere of the movie while not focusing much on character arcs or personalities.  They're completely different movies."

RedLetterMedia,39iiim,Feudalist,47,Thu Jun 11 23:32:25 2015 UTC,"It all started when some users of /tv/ found out about a man named Garrett Gilchrist, who used to be friends/coworkers with Mike and Jay long before they became successful. As they were looking through his youtubes videos of him playing with MLP dolls they noticed that he was, coincidentally, doing a live stream for a few people.   They started to ask questions about Mike and Jay. One of the things that Gilchrist said was something along the lines of: 'Mike isn't a racist, but grew up with lots of racists'.  The inversion became an in-joke in RLM threads on /tv/, calling Mike a racist, usually through a fake middle name. Mike 'the third Reich' Stoklasa.  It should be noted that this is all done as jokes, nobody really believes that Mike is a racist and everybody realized that that Gilchrist guy was probably making things up and probably a dick."

But delivered it unironically so it was as lame as you'd think it'd be. And then those characters never came back.   Remember when Gandalf was facing off with the Balrog and was all like, ""YOU SHALL NOT PASS!"" Of course you do because it was awesome. And then he broke the rocks underfoot. He didn't shoot wizard lazer beams everywhere. Hobbit looked worse than Your Highness.  And the Balrog had actual tangible form, Gandalf wasn't shooting ray blasts at an interdimensional nebulous fire eye thing. And the movie built up to the Balrog moment. The Cate Blanchette scene was so so bad. Jesus.  I was super disappointed. Almost like the movie was designed to make me feel disappointed, like that was the point of it existing. To disappoint audiences.  Big missed opportunity to flesh out all the dwarves instead of shoehorning all that other shit. Then there's the ""Smeagol worked out, let's make everything CGI!

RedLetterMedia,38xzgg,TomServoMST3K,3,Thu Jun 11 12:28:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe $2000-3000 per film. Sorta.  When you sell a film to DVD houses like Braindamage films, you'll get a small chunk upfront with the agreement that you'll provide all the deliverables (DVD master, etc). This is how most Distributors screw over microbudget filmmakers, if you want to get paid upfront - you won't get any on the back-end (which you'd never see anyways - because Distributors are crooked fucks). This is partly why you can get some REALLY shitty DVDs with play-errors and glitches, because the filmmaker wants (needs) to try and do everything as cheaply as possible (usually meaning themselves) and hang on to that upfront cash - because it's all they'll ever see.  That's as far as he'll make from the Distributor, these guys might make another grand or two selling DVDs (which they have to buy from the Distributor - if they're lucky, at a sliiiiight discount) at local Cons. And after the costs of going to the Con, profit another few hundred bucks - maybe.  TL;DR - He might walk away with a few hundred dollars more than he started with.  Which when your film costs ~3 grand, that's a good profit percentage-wise."

RedLetterMedia,38ticv,gratefuldeadlift,9,Sat Jun 6 18:06:37 2015 UTC,"One of the problems with music reviews is that for some reason they often turn into shit like this.   There is also the issue that music usually manages to be even more controversial and divisive than movies and video games. People look down on, make fun of, and even downright hate anything that isn't their taste. It basically amounts to a shitflinging mess which is summed up pretty concisely by this:   Music I like: God tier  Music you like: Shit tier   However I think you are right that if done right something like RLM style album reviews could be pretty interesting. I would prefer something more focused on lyrics and background information on the band and their inspiration though, because anything other than the most basic technical music stuff just goes over my head."
RedLetterMedia,38ticv,NormalNormalNormal,9,Sat Jun 6 21:44:38 2015 UTC,Check out Anthony Fantano. Hey pretty much the best music critic and his humor is kinda similar to RLM.

RedLetterMedia,38ticv,0548,3,Sat Jun 6 22:28:06 2015 UTC,"Thing is though music is very subjective so most review shows would either praise a music piece, saying all the ways it succeeds, or burn it to the ground, pointing out all its flaws only due to their biased opinion.  I've never heard anyone say ""I like the lyrics but the music is shit"" or ""the first verse was golden but the chorus wasn't catchy"" or ""the bass is too loud and the guitar doesn't stand out at all"" or anything along those lines.  It's either ""beautiful; it all fits; it's like poetry - they rhyme"" or it's ""the worst thing since my son; everything is wrong with it; lemme tell you in great detail how"". There's no middle ground in my experience.  However it might be possible to pull off reviews like this if you have an idea of how to exactly structure them and if you purposefully stray away from subjectivity."

RedLetterMedia,38px0i,IWantCandy_666,-16,Sat Jun 6 02:17:04 2015 UTC,Which is kind of a dumb statement. Most of RLM jokes are in a similar vein. They're cheesy one-liners.

Too many shoehorned ""totally epic!"" action movie cliches that fell completely flat.  I would, however, be interested to hear in depth what Mike and Jay had to say about it, apart from Jay's one tweet. It's interesting because RLM's movies definitely seem to go for the ""ironically bad"" dynamic as well, but something just feels so much more earnest and fun in their films compared to KF."

The Horror at 37,000 Feet is just so 70's weird with the combination of a formulaic airplane jeopardy plot and a nonsensical ghost story, but you can tell the actors and everyone involved really tried to do their best with the script and low budget; it was much more entertaining for me and had better Shatner moments."

I'm excited for the new main trilogy but I'm getting the feeling more and more that Disney has terminal Marvelitis and they will overexpose Star Wars with a bunch of action schlock exploitation films based around popular characters (we're probably in for decades of Boba Fett films). Do you really trust modern Hollywood to maintain a high level of quality through so many films? The Obi Wan films would make no sense, he just hid from the Empire on Tatooine between the trilogies and watched over Luke. Him going on some rip-roaring light saber twirling adventure featuring Darth Maul sounds absolutely awful.  I will say though that Ewan McGregor is a very talented actor who was poorly written for and poorly directed by Lucas and it would in some way be interesting to see him have a second chance at the role."

RedLetterMedia,38gc0q,TortillaTequila,16,Sun Jun 7 01:44:38 2015 UTC,"Um, I'm no Star Wars expert, but isn't Kenobi supposed to be hiding in the time period comprised between episode 3 and 4? Like, keeping a very, very, very low profile because he is a Jedi? If he is out having a huge adventure, with explosions, CGI, lightsabers, etc. wouldn't that blow his cover? You know they are going to drag Vader to it somehow. Aw, fuck it."
RedLetterMedia,38gc0q,FuckYouZackSnyder,7,Thu Jun 4 04:29:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and he and Yoda were supposed to be the Jedi in the galaxy after ROTS, but that didn't stop the EU from creating new Jedi survivors every time they wanted to tell a story about laser swords."
RedLetterMedia,38gc0q,Zenith_and_Quasar,3,Thu Jun 4 17:55:30 2015 UTC,"Do they say at any point during the movies that Yoda and Obi-Wan are the only ""known"" Jedi survivors? That's a loophole that is easy to exploit. Again, not an expert on Star Wars. Seen the OT movies maybe once each, when I was a kid."
RedLetterMedia,38gc0q,FuckYouZackSnyder,2,Thu Jun 4 20:17:22 2015 UTC,I don't think they say it but I think it is implied. Also I kind of like it better that way. Especially since they are old and dying and it makes sense they are relying heavily on Luke to carry on the legacy of the Jedi.  Also the idea that Anakin brought balance to the force could refer to the fact that at the end of Episode III there are two Jedi (Obi Wan and Yoda) and two Sith (Darth Vader and Darth Sidious).
RedLetterMedia,38gc0q,NormalNormalNormal,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:28:50 2015 UTC,"Perhaps he becomes a stealthy Jedi where he prevents things from happening to Luke. It isn't stated that he's hiding, just that he went into hiding (by his own choice), but also Luke talks about Old Ben, so he's clearly aware of who the guy is. I could see him helping Luke as a child and preventing bad things from happening to him and/or fighting people to prevent finding him, or something. Doesn't sound like the most interesting trilogy, though."

RedLetterMedia,38gc0q,starwarshobbit,8,Thu Jun 4 08:43:40 2015 UTC,"According to the website, Disney are in talks with Ewan McGregor for an “unknown project”, and their source is telling them the project is new trilogy of movies with him reprising his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi from the Star Wars prequels. Their source claims that this new trilogy of films would take place between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope and would see Obi-Wan watch over a maturing Luke Skywalker with appearances from Owen Lars and Darth Maul.   It's on the article linked in OP."

RedLetterMedia,38gc0q,starwarshobbit,26,Thu Jun 4 16:41:09 2015 UTC,"It's cause Ewan's actually a good actor and they want a redo. I remember when the news broke he would be Obi-Wan, everyone loved the idea. But then George Lucas happened.   But don't get me wrong, I'm expecting all this shit to suck. Not Jurassic World/BatmanvSuperman bad, but still pretty bad/disappointing.  As long as they make it as if the prequels/edits never existed, I'll probably be fine with it."

They have the technology, they can reboot them, better, smarter."
RedLetterMedia,38gc0q,Meph616,2,Thu Jun 4 12:25:41 2015 UTC,It's not a story that needs to be told that wasn't already told in the originals. Obi-Wan said Darth was a good friend and was seduced by the dark side. Got it. Don't need 3 movies to see him get burned and stuffed into a robot suit.
RedLetterMedia,38gc0q,fatty_fatshits,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:37:29 2015 UTC,"Besides just quoting what Plinkett said and how he said it, yes, that's correct, you don't need 3 movies to tell that stor. Which is why it's a reboot. You don't have to follow what Lucas did, in face it's pretty much encouraged NOT to follow what Lucas did. You can still have Anakin's rise and fall but that could all be built up and executed in the 3rd movie. With maybe only a couple bits of foreshadowing, instead of a heavy focus, in the first two.  Just because Lucas started with trade negotiations and pod-racing doesn't mean you have to start that way all over again.   I'd sooner have the first two movies build on the SW Universe and instead of telling how Obi and Ani are friends show how they are friends. Make it an adventure piece with them going to the Jedi counsel, they say ""shits got real over in the Whatever System"" and send them off to investigate or intervene. Hijinks ensue as we watch them go on a journey, building their friendship. Ya know, all that expository stuff they talked about like the time they got trapped in a nest of gundarks. Show those adventures instead of Senate disputes and trade negotiations."
RedLetterMedia,38gc0q,Meph616,2,Thu Jun 4 15:24:36 2015 UTC,"But why? To qoute plinkett again, what's interesting about Vader's story is his redemption, not how he became Vader. I couldn't care less about that. He's just some asshole in a robot suit."
RedLetterMedia,38gc0q,fatty_fatshits,2,Thu Jun 4 15:30:37 2015 UTC,"Just because Plinkett said it doesn't make it gospel. You are allowed to have your own opinion.  Yeah, Vader's story is about his redemption. But ANAKIN'S story is about his fall, and how even the best of us can be lead astray. ""All it takes is one bad day!""  Again, Plinkett said ""You can do it one of two ways, character story or a small part of a bigger story."" I see that as a false dichotomy, I'd like to see Anakin as a big part of a big story, just as Luke was a big part of a big story. The key is that there has to be a big story, and not just background noise. Prequels as Lucas made them was just noise to add filler to the story of Anakin. And to top it off he can't write characters. So not only was the story bad but the character dialogue/development and motivations were bad! That's why they should be given a second chance.   I think it would be interesting to see the classic Hero's Journey story but where at the end the Hero fails. That's Anakin's story. And it would be nice to have that as a contrast to Luke's story, the son of a failed Hero, abandoned and exiled, to rise and succeed where his father failed. And for THEN the father, Vader, to redeem himself for his past failure. You can just give a 2 second soundbite of exposition and say ""got it"" but it has no emotional impact."
RedLetterMedia,38gc0q,Meph616,-2,Thu Jun 4 15:43:54 2015 UTC,"It's like poetry, it rhymes. If your argument is basically ""any story can be told well"" then why are you so insistent they make a prequel? Something by definition as unnecessary to the ultimate conclusion of the original story???"
RedLetterMedia,38gc0q,fatty_fatshits,3,Thu Jun 4 16:19:34 2015 UTC,If only they hadn't made that retarded crossguard lightsaber. I fear it's going to ruin the movie for me completely.
RedLetterMedia,38gc0q,tissn,3,Thu Jun 4 07:44:18 2015 UTC,I don't see why the crossguard ruins it for people. I never saw the shape as that iconic and it's pretty practical with all the hands being cut off by sliding down the saber when they're crossing sabers.
RedLetterMedia,38gc0q,Sennin_BE,8,Thu Jun 4 12:09:53 2015 UTC,"This has nothing to do with the ""iconic"" shape of the original lightsaber. I'm disappointed precisely because the new sword is so fucking impractical (and no, it's not about the wielder being in danger of hurting himself - see this and this for what I mean).  In contrast; I didn't mind the dual blade introduced by Maul in Ep 1 - because it's obviously practical and advantageous if duelling multiple opponents."
RedLetterMedia,38gc0q,tissn,2,Thu Jun 4 12:52:54 2015 UTC,But you know almost nothing about the film. How do you know the logic behind the lightsaber?

Do you expect to see a carbon copy of the original films or something? Absolutely nothing changed? People, they're new movies, of course they're going to add new things. Also the cross-guard prevents people from getting their hand chopped off, and we've already seen two Jedi's getting their hands chopped off. If anything, it's a very clever move.   I get it, Jay and Mike and cynical and so everyone on this subreddit has to follow exactly in their footsteps, but have some opinions of your own, people. You can like things they don't like, and vice versa. Star Wars originals still exist, go watch those if you cannot accept change. It's going to happen, new characters, new designs, new story.

Mike even talked Jessie into doing a semi-nude scene that was going to be exercised from the script since I told him he probably wouldn't be able to convince her to do it. But he had her eating out of his hand. Mike is truly an actor's director. He knew how important the nude scene was to the story and to the vulnerability of the character. And believe me, the nude scene is going to make the movie worth watching. It's tasteful and truly a sentimental, memorable moment.

MST3K is much more polished/practiced (though it often has its own low-budget moments) and timing is very important. There are some similarities between them but they're really two different beasts.   It's impossible to know if you'll like it until you watch it, but this is a pretty decent top 10 list that should get you started.  You can watch many episodes online as linked from club-mst3k.com"
RedLetterMedia,38bvdc,raabco,12,Wed Jun 3 05:45:12 2015 UTC,"BotW is improvised, relaxed and off the cuff.  MST3K is heavily pre-planned, written, edited, re-written, rehearsed, re-written, recorded, and edited.  Other than both featuring b-movies, they bear little resemblance."
RedLetterMedia,38bvdc,ElRunko,6,Wed Jun 3 07:35:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of the humor is in the same ballpark (mocking crappy or stupid stuff in bad movies).  BOTW is more of a clip show of the worst bits of several crappy movies, while MST3K shows you most or all of one crappy movie, so they are fairly different in structure.  But I'd say if you enjoy one, you'd probably enjoy the other."
RedLetterMedia,38bvdc,ButterDream,3,Wed Jun 3 12:05:51 2015 UTC,"It's a different style.  ... but... yeah, no one is dethroning MST3K anytime soon."

RedLetterMedia,387ahv,j_cobe,9,Tue Jun 2 12:21:47 2015 UTC,Karen! I haven't heard from her since that time I imagined myself at  her and Rich's engagement party. We all had a great time. It's nice to hear from her again.
RedLetterMedia,387ahv,ColonelSandersCult,14,Tue Jun 2 19:57:18 2015 UTC,"She's a background character in one of the Plinkett reviews. She has a big role in the expanded universe, though."
RedLetterMedia,387ahv,SeanWJF,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:23:43 2015 UTC,"Karen is Rich Evan's fiancée.  Rich Evans is RLM's most beloved actor/handyman/gamer/punching bag. We love Rich unconditionally - it's part of the social contract we fans of RLM all agree to. He's also an internet ""star"" (the infamous droid masturbation moment) and, unfortunately, a meme.  Rich and Jack, this guy that some folks love to dislike (and they're wrong, Jack's great), have a streaming show called Previously Recorded where they play games and talk about RLM, stuff, nerd stuff, pop culture and, sometimes, the game they're playing. It's the closest we have to a RLM podcast and since they're finishing up Space Cop and little else is coming out of the guys, it's how some of us keep in touch with the RLM crew (though it's mostly Rich and Jack on the stream but Jay's there some times).  Karen, by transitive property of future marriage, is by default a great person - being associated with Rich grants you that boon - but, it so happens, she REALLY is funny and smart.  Karen is rarely on Previously Recorded but when she is, it has always been terrific.  So there you have it, any other questions?  Ninja Edit: By ""funny and smart"" I mean that Karen is a COLOSSAL nerd. She's into some really weird and fun stuff."

The parallels aren't particularly deep though, just some stylistic similarities, especially to early T&E like ""Tom Goes to the Mayor"".   They definitely don't have T&E's hallmark of getting in the face of their audience in an aggressive way and grossing you out or making you feel uncomfortable. Even the Plinkett reviews are more traditional humor and lighthearted in their own way. Plinkett's whole persona is a self-deprecating satire of an obsessive fan taken to an extreme. The vulgar aspects set up jokes, they aren't the joke in and of themselves like in much of T&E's work."

RedLetterMedia,37znxv,TheRonPerlMen,8,Sun May 31 23:46:53 2015 UTC,I don't think Broken Age is the greatest example of a point-and-click adventure game.  The game's puzzles were just frustrating instead of clever.  I grew up with Lucas Arts adventure games so I much prefer them.  Good example is Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis or The Dig.  I also played some more recent point and clicks that I enjoyed like the Deponia games.  So I wouldn't base a decision of the point and click genre on Broken Age.

RedLetterMedia,37t8f3,Penmerton,2,Sat May 30 07:13:36 2015 UTC,sounds legit
RedLetterMedia,37t8f3,karlhungusjr,-3,Sat May 30 07:34:45 2015 UTC,Here's my entire chatlog (the first 'banned' was a timeout or something)  http://i.imgur.com/znkW3LF.jpg
RedLetterMedia,37t8f3,Penmerton,7,Sat May 30 08:00:31 2015 UTC,I remember the chat you were being a bit of a rude prick. They asked you to follow the rules politely and you acted like a spoilt little kid. When you are in someone else's house you follow their rules or leave.
RedLetterMedia,37t8f3,doyle871,-8,Sat May 30 10:36:58 2015 UTC,"Rude prick? Spoiled kid? The chat log is right there, I simply can't see what you're talking about. Can you tell me exactly which rule I broke?"
RedLetterMedia,37t8f3,Penmerton,1 point,Sat May 30 14:02:03 2015 UTC,"Nice edited chat log. Mrshysmile posted the rules once and you acted like a spoiled asshole, and then tried getting others to put the mods on the ignore list, from what I remember. I love how everyone in chat starts crying that they weren't doing anything wrong once they get timed out for it/banned."
RedLetterMedia,37t8f3,johnkilo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:59:05 2015 UTC,"There's nothing edited, it's everything I said in their chat from the moment I found the channel, to getting banned.  If you don't believe me, watch the vod on chrome with rechat for twitch extension. I'm actually glad you think it must be edited - it shows you think I must have said something worse than what I've posted in order to get banned, when I didn't."
RedLetterMedia,37t8f3,Penmerton,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:11:35 2015 UTC,"Not being a dick is one of the rules in chat. Advising others to block a mod for simply posting the rules is a good way to get banned. You were just some ass that showed up and tried to stir up shit, we don't need people like you in chat. Goodbye."
RedLetterMedia,37t8f3,johnkilo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:57:51 2015 UTC,"So are you going to admit you were wrong about me 'editing' my chatlog? ""Don't be a dick"" is an extremely vague ""rule"" and allows over-sensitive mods to abuse their privs."
RedLetterMedia,37t8f3,Penmerton,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:31:39 2015 UTC,"I don't admit anything, it was many weeks ago at this point, stop crying about it and move on with your life."
RedLetterMedia,37t8f3,johnkilo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:36:38 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I clearly didn't edit my chatlog, which can be proven with rechat for twitch vods. Are you one of the mods on pre-recorded live? Would you consider what I typed to be worthy of a permanent ban? If so, could you explain why?"

In fact, the study I link below talks about how higher quality audio makes people think the VIDEO quality is higher too. It also keeps people more engaged with the video.

I always imagined some sort of bitter weeping from Jack, as Rich drove the car over those movies. Perhaps he had to be physically restrained and was screaming ""No, don't you do it Rich!"" as Rich cackled maniacally before getting in the car. Then Rich said ""Theodore Rex? More like Theodore wrecked!""   I think behind the scenes of RLM is high drama in my head. :)"

RedLetterMedia,37nphu,NormalNormalNormal,9,Fri May 29 01:56:43 2015 UTC,"They didn't do a typical round-table discussion about it, so it wasn't subject to the typical voting process or much of anything else despite the fact that they apparently watched it. The joke seemed to be that they watched it and it was so bad that they never mentioned it again. Because of that, it might not count officially.

I still hope for new WotW episodes, but during those first 4 episodes, my friend and I were always talking about which of the tapes they would see next and talking about just how bad some of the tapes they skipped over could possibly be.  When they would pick one of those tapes that had been on the wheel for multiple episodes, we would get so excited, and that was the fun of the wheel. But then lately they started just killing off tons of the videos and there are very few that live multiple episodes to get excited about.  But that's just my opinion. The show is still incredibly fun and I can't wait for them to watch Farm Safety: Family Style."

RedLetterMedia,37kz3a,A_Big_One,1 point,Fri May 29 03:40:37 2015 UTC,"It is logical, and I don't really have a problem with the video, but it's kind of strange to me. Duplicitous isn't the right word. Maybe slightly hypocritical or hollow?   It's almost like the smoking industry lobby doing a video to curb secondhand smoke, or OPEC doing a video about oil spills.   Those may not be perfect analogies but you get what I'm saying; obviously they don't want kids shooting people or for gun accidents to happen, but making a video is nothing compared to what they could (but won't) do to decrease the problem, or to at least stop contributing to it. It comes off almost like a half-hearted apology.   I would say that's the reason the NRA influences the reaction to the video."
RedLetterMedia,37kz3a,Ephisus,2,Fri May 29 07:02:56 2015 UTC,What if the tobacco lobby made a video about not setting your couch on fire because you feel asleep with a lot cigarette in your hand?  How about a turkey fryer company making a video to teach Rich Evans not to set a house on fire.  It really just comes down to silly political notions about guns that are the product of how safe our society is.
RedLetterMedia,37kz3a,A_Big_One,2,Fri May 29 12:11:28 2015 UTC,"What, are you denying that the purpose of guns are to kill people? I guess if you want to split hairs you can say hunting too, so their purpose is to kill would be accurate then?  That was the most reasonable thing Jack said about guns/the NRA though, and isn't negative at all."

Viewing killing as a ""nice side benefit of the hardware"" isn't how I want the NRA or gun enthusiasts to view them, and the fact that you say that explains why people argue guns aren't necessary. If the killing machines are used as toys, then just use something else."

I'm so confused.  ""Nice benefits"" are good things.    EDIT: Oh, I get it.  You thinking killing is bad, right?  ... seriously, though.  Noncriminal homocide is a thing.

RedLetterMedia,37i639,odiin1731,3,Thu May 28 05:49:06 2015 UTC,I'm not familiar with it. I am familiar with encoding video into h.264 though. How do the processes compare? (We can assume that there are virtually no effects.)
RedLetterMedia,37i639,teleekom,5,Thu May 28 05:53:14 2015 UTC,"It depends on the software and the amount of effects, and the computer. I did a show on Avid at University, and a 13 minute video took about an hour to render on a very fast computer. I'm guessing they use Final Cut  or Premiere, which both take a lot longer and BOTW videos are around 40-50 minutes. So I'm gonna guess rendering for this episode probably takes them 3 hours, maybe a lot longer or slightly less. BUT, exporting is it's own bitch. Exporting/encoding my 13 minute episodes out of Avid took about 3 hours if I ran multiple passes for better quality. Again, I'm guessing Final Cut and Premiere take longer but I'm not very familiar with those programs."

I've heard Jay say several times on the PreRec streams that the process of viewing these movies back to back is often ""miserable"". He would never want to do a live stream of a BoTW screening just because so much of the entertainment only comes after editing.  Case in point: I once tried viewing American Flatulators before they viewed it on the Wheel. Big mistake. Had I waited, I could have been warned what an utterly irredeemable piece of dreck that was without having to suffer it first hand.

I dunno, for a podcast it's not best not the worst, there are plenty of other shitty podcasts. Mostly just sounds like a nostalgia trip with a few sound bites. I was pretty bored for most of it and dont really have any desire to listen to more episodes. Wish they would have attempted to ask him more in depth questions about RLM. But whatev. 3/10"

RedLetterMedia,3701pq,zerozed,-29,Sun May 24 18:59:00 2015 UTC,"I really, really despise MST3K.  Since they first began airing that crap, up until present day, I find those fuckers--and the people who like them--really annoying.  They really belittle movies, actors, FX artists, etc.  They have zero appreciation for psychotronic cinema and no respect for the folks who at least attempted to make genre films (mostly on miniscule budgets).  One of the reasons I do like RLM is that Jay and Mike started off as hacks working on non-existent budgets so their comments often include some empathy.  Their BOTW stuff with Len Kabasinski is a good illustration of why RLM's commentary on ""bad"" movies is far better than anything MST3K has ever done."

It was also smart comedy, which is pretty rare. They  often referenced some amazingly obscure analogies to what was happening on screen. The annotated Youtube videos are a good place to start, to see just how esoteric their riffs were sometimes.  I guess I just can't see how someone can so thoroughly hate one and like the other, considering that a lot of the support for BotW was practically born from the cultural zeitgeist surrounding MST's renaissance of bringing bad 50s/60s/70s B-movies to the youth of the time. And especially considering that one of the RLM crew is actually a fan of MST3k, as evidenced by this podcast.   Oh well. We should all probably just relax. :)"

Though that was the only thing I really didn't like about MST3K. There were too many outdated pop culture references and obscure jokes that went over my head as someone who grew up quite a while after the show originally aired.  I also just generally enjoy RLM's style of humor and presentation more than MST3K, and they really help revamp the formula and humor of a show like this for a modern audience. But MST3K is still cool in its own way."

People who are ""fans"" tend to look for something positive and not revel in mocking what is lacking.    Take ""Warriors of the Wasteland"" for example.  MST3K did an episode where they hammered it.  It is easy to laugh at, but real genre fans put it in context of the broader 80s Italian post-apocalyptic genre.  Any real fan of psychotronic cinema would know that Enzo Castellari was the director--and he has a much broader body of work including some outstanding Spaghetti Westerns and Poliziotteschi.  Films like Warriors of the Wasteland were cheap films made quick to exploit the success of Hollywood blockbusters.  Castellari actually did the best he could given the resources and time available.  Yes it is cheap, the plot is hack, and the the dialogue is stupid...but the stunts are great, the violence/gore is good....the film delivers what is expected of the genre.  Since I'm already downvoted so far I'm sure nobody will read any of this...but I don't care.  I've been a fan of real psychotronic cinema for longer than most of you pole-smokers have been alive.

MST3K does absolutely nothing but mock the films...that's the idea behind the show.    You are completely wrong. It's true that the riffing started to become more harsh towards the later seasons but this was after half of the original writing team had left the show, including the creator. Originally, the show was developed as a way for a group of comedians to come together and take these forgotten and discarded movies and create a new form from them. A quote from the show's creator Joel Hodgson: ""Our riffs were never too negative. We were the audience’s companions, and people don’t want to spend time with assholes. If you’re negative, it may be funny, but it’s not sustainable. So we had a lot of respect for the movies, because we had to work with them. Trace [Beaulieu] once said a really clever thing: “The movies are Margaret Dumont, and we’re the Marx Brothers.”""   Take ""Warriors of the Wasteland"" for example. MST3K did an episode where they hammered it.   No, there is no MST3K episode featuring this movie.   Films like Warriors of the Wasteland were cheap films made quick to exploit the success of Hollywood blockbusters.   Why do you think cheaply produced cash grabs should be immune from criticism or mockery?    I've been a fan of real psychotronic cinema for longer than most of you pole-smokers have been alive... dumbass nerds or  hipsters   Oh, you're trolling... never mind."

I enjoy RLM's BOTW--primarily because the goal of the show is to find the ""best"" which invariably has them discussing how the films succeed in what they're attempting to do.  A recent example would be when they watched Cynthia Rothrock in ""Undefeatable.""  Although they do laugh at the outrageous elements, they also spend lots of time commenting on the entertaining parts of the film.  This is what sets BOTW apart from MST3K--the premise of BOTW is to find the one film with the most redeeming qualities that sets it above its b-movie peers.    As to ""shitty italian mad max rip offs""....yes the Italians exploited the hell out of that genre...your assessment that they're all ""shitty"" shows that you're obviously not a fan.  Italian exploitation cinema--whether it be post-apocalyptic, Poliziotteschi, Giallo, Cannibal, Nun-sploitation, Nazi-sploitation, Zombie-sploitation, and even Spaghetti Westerns were all cheap, rushed, and derivative.  In that sense it IS like The Asylum.  However, The Asylum has yet to produce directors like Fulci, Argento, Bava, Lenzi, Castellari or even more hardcore folks like Bruno Mattei and Joe D'Amato,    As to the male on male rape scene in ""Warriors of the Wasteland""--that is one of the elements that makes the film fucking awesome.  There is almost no context for it and it is outrageous.  The only real purpose it serves is to shock the audience.  People who have seen that film REMEMBER that shit because it is so crazy.

I enjoy most Italian post-apocalypse films on some level--but my taste in Italian schlock isn't what most people disagree with--it is my dislike of MST3K.  In the same manner that you might not discern any entertainment value in Italian exploitation films, I find nothing about MST3K entertaining.  And--unlike most of the imbeciles who downvote without offering a defense of their beloved show, I've given some reasons why I do not like it:  e.g. 1:  It does nothing but mock the movies and belittle those involved with the production 2:  They talk all during the film that I'm trying to watch, making their antics the center of attention, not the movie.  Obviously MST3K was a popular show with a certain segment of the population.  However, I'd argue that people who are fans of MST3K are not really fans of low-budget movies--they're fans of MST3K making fun of low-budget movies.

The premise of Best of the Worst is to find the most amusing parts of bad B-movies and highlight them for the audience. They don't show the best parts. They show the funniest parts. The sincere failures.  RLM 'glibly eviscerates' nearly every title (with the rare exceptions of Xtro and Thunderpants). Mike has said at least a couple times 'all 3 are the worst things I've ever seen' and/or 'destroy all three'. Len Kabasinski literally had to demand they  say something positive about the ninja movies they watched when he was on (and it was a joke when they did). RLM talks/riffs over the movies all the time, at least in the portions of the films they show with them on camera. And they literally destroy a copy of whichever B-movie they consider the 'worst' more often than not.  Just as a disclaimer, I love RLM (and MST3k).   You don't like MST3k, fine. It's not appealing to everyone. But don't pretend as if RLM doesn't do very similar things during their show to somehow justify your dichotomous view of these two shows. RLM simply comes at it from a more critical standpoint with their 'discussion' section. But they are going for comedy at the expense of the movies they watched. Just because they occasionally find something good, doesn't change the fact that the comedy is the goal in both shows."
