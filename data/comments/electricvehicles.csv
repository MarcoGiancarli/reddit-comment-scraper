electricvehicles,3dupc4,OompaOrangeFace,3,Sun Jul 19 17:36:20 2015 UTC,Ford was barely ready to compete in the second half of the 20th century automotive market...
electricvehicles,3dupc4,Lonelan,3,Sun Jul 19 18:25:04 2015 UTC,I've been very impressed with Ford for the past 5 years (current generation vehicles). The Focus EV is probably the best compliance car EV. I'm just worried that they are going to be caught out in the transition to EVs. I'm all for having multiple manufacturers to help push the tech forward and cheaper.
electricvehicles,3dupc4,Muck777,2,Sun Jul 19 18:58:08 2015 UTC,"I think they are probably just letting the others do the leg work. Developing an EV is no small undertaking, and at the current market share, it's probably questionable if it's economical.  Diesels were brought to the market by Peugeot and Citroen, and it was only after their success that the other manufactures jumped on the bandwagon."
electricvehicles,3dupc4,DominusFL,2,Mon Jul 20 09:38:22 2015 UTC,Ford previously licensed their hybrid technology from Toyota. I'm assuming their plan is to eventually license their EV technology the same way when the market requires it.
electricvehicles,3dupc4,azrix,2,Mon Jul 20 16:03:08 2015 UTC,"Rumor is that they'll announce a 200 mile EV at the LA Auto Show in November, or thereabouts.  I guess I might be an outlier, but I see the Focus Electric as more of an open beta test rather than a compliance car. It's more like BMW's Active E and Mini E than the Fiat 500e, IMO. If that's the case, it makes perfect sense that Ford would have plans for a larger production EV when they think the market is right. With the Chevrolet Bolt announcement, they want a competing vehicle.   I did get a chance to ask Mr. Fields the big question that’s on every EVangelist’s mind: Does Ford have a new generation of EVs on the test track? “Nothing that we can talk about now,” said he with a sly smile.   I've seen a couple comments like this in Ford-related articles. That's why I think they are going to announce something this year or early next year."

They only concerned themselves with the Driving part and dismissed the whole extract,refine,transport part from the ICE.  Well yes, if it is a coal plant in some podunk town then it's dirtier based on ICE vs EV but again, no one talked about how they get the gas to the podunk town in the first place.

But when you plug your EV from the same dirty coal station they include the coal plant in the EVs 'dirty' scale.  Hardly a 'fair' comparison to how 'dirty' an EV is compared to an ICE.  (oh, EVs charge from coal plants so let's add the coal plants pollution to the EV scale, but let's ignore that with the ICE because the ICE fills from the pump)  And my 'shitty' videos explain what your wall of text does in a more infographic format that everyone can understand.  That cars that spew particulates and hot emissions are not more cleaner or even close to EVs  But as you must work for a fossil fuel based company, you don't want to listen/view reason."
electricvehicles,3dhy6h,OmniaII,-5,Thu Jul 16 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"takes more electricity to convert oil to gas.    That's just wrong. Not only that, but you have to take into account, that refining would be happening anyway, because we use the oil for WAY more things than just driving cars. Gasoline is just one of the many products of refining oil.  It's absolutely fair, the study does also not take the emissions into account, which are produces while mining and refining the minerals for batteries and the fuel used by power plants to generate electricity."

electricvehicles,3dce05,bbqroast,3,Wed Jul 15 04:17:34 2015 UTC,"Every EV can charge with the J1772 standard connector and protocol. This type of charging (commonly called Level 1 or 2) works by feeding residential or commercial AC power (i.e. 120-240V) direct to the charger on board the car. Tesla's cars come with different connectors, but they use the same protocol, and they all come with adapters so they can use the standard connectors.  Where there's a big mess is in DC quick charging, where a large external charger is connected directly to the EV's battery and sends 300-400V DC power to it. CHAdeMO is the de facto worldwide standard here, with by far the most amount of compatible cars (such as the Leaf) on the roads and chargers in service. However, Tesla didn't adopt CHAdeMO, likely at least in part because the existing chargers and specifications didn't allow for the amount of power they desired, so they came up with their own Superchargers. But they do sell an adapter so their cars can use public CHAdeMO chargers (but no other EVs can use Superchargers.) I believe CHAdeMO was originally a closed standard that required a licensing fee, but is now open (follow the link and read up to verify.)  Then, very late to the game the SAE decided to introduce yet another standard, the CCS, which is in use by only a handful of EVs in the U.S. As yet, there are no CHAdeMO-CCS or Tesla-CCS adapters available, but most newly installed DC QCs are ""dual-headed"" units with both CHAdeMO and CCS connectors."

Mitsubishi and Nissan do not yet use Type-2 plugs, but they will do so soon, because from 2017(?) it will required for EV cars sold in Europe.  Currently there are more Chademo plugs than CCS, but CCS is used by more companies. More CCS plugs are installed every week in Europe."

All these stations are going to be positioned alongside Dutch highways, right next to existing gas stations.  I think Fastned is a wonderful example of how fast-charging infrastructure should be done. Tesla's superchargers are awesome, but they only have 3 of those in our country, and non-Tesla cars can't use them. We are also very much in need of a charging infrastructure that suits all EV's.

electricvehicles,3d27e4,David949,9,Sun Jul 12 22:46:49 2015 UTC,"The fiat is rated at 27kWh per 100 miles from what I've found. A 20MPG car uses 5 gallons per 100 miles. At 12¢/kWh and $4/gallon, the gas car would cost $20/100 miles and the fiat would cost $3.24/100 miles.  (LPT: the EPA requires fuel/100mi to be shown on the window sticker and is more useful/straightforward than raw MPG to calculate fuel costs)"
electricvehicles,3d27e4,ImTheDerek,6,Sun Jul 12 23:11:26 2015 UTC,"Let's start by boiling this down to Energy cost per mile.  For the gas car, 20mpg at $4/gal is pretty easy to figure out. Start with the fraction 20mi/1gal, divide top and bottom by 20 to get 1mi/0.05gal, multiply the bottom by $4/1gal to convert to just dollars and cancel out the unit of gallons to arrive at 1mi/$0.20.  The ICEV that gets an average of 20mpg costs 20 cents per mile to drive, in energy costs alone, at $4/gallon of gasoline.  The EPA's MPGe rating for the Fiat 500e is 122 city/104 highway, but this is a measure of energy consumed, not of cost per mile, as different energy sources can have a different cost to deliver the same unit of energy. ""MPGe"" means Miles Per Gallon-Equivalent, which is an estimation of the usable chemical energy in one gallon of gasoline. The EPA puts that estimate at 33.7kWh, and that's what we need to use.  I don't know if you'll be doing more city or highway driving, so I'll just average the two together, to get 113MPGe. Now let's start the math.  113mi/33.7kWh divides to 3.35mi/1kWh. Divide both terms by 3.35 and you'll arrive at 1mi/0.299kWh. Now, to figure out what that costs you, you'll have to look at your power bill, but the highest estimate I've seen for California residential consumers is about 17 cents per kWh, which puts the Fiat 500e at 1mi/$0.05.  The Fiat 500e will cost 5 cents per mile to drive, in energy costs alone, when charged only at home in California, at 17 cents per kWh.  Now, some other things to consider:   If you're going from a car you own to a brand new EV, you'll have to make car payments, and you'll have to get Full Coverage insurance if you don't have it already.  Many public car charging stations are free right now, but some will charge you a small amount. If you have access to a free charging station, then obviously that will reduce your average cost per mile even further. EVs do not require oil changes, timing belt changes (or timing belts at all), and they rely more on regenerators for braking, so they should require brake maintenance much less frequently. This is still not a significant cost for ICEVs (tens of dollars per thousands of miles) if a maintenance schedule is followed closely, but ICEVs will experience heavy wear and possibly catastrophic failure if maintenance is delayed."
electricvehicles,3d27e4,Liger_Zero_Schneider,4,Mon Jul 13 00:58:12 2015 UTC,You don't care about MPG. You want to know ¢/mile. That's even territory. 20mi/gal÷$4/gal=5mi/$ or 20¢/mi.  My Leaf got about 4 mi/KWH and I pay about about 15¢/KWH so 4mi/kwh÷15¢/kwh=.267mi/¢ or 3.75¢/mi

electricvehicles,3ctcg0,hainesk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:23:58 2015 UTC,"I think the way the system works, technically all 200k miles are on battery since the motor almost never directly drives the wheels. The only difference is the battery is being charged by the gasoline engine directly (DC charging) vs the battery being charged via an EVSE (AC) through the car's charge controller which then converts it to DC but at a lower current.   Interestingly, the 2016 Volt I believe is supposed to change this because it is actually more efficient to have the gasoline engine drive the wheels directly than to have it charge the battery, so they set it up to drive the wheels directly more often.  Also, charging the battery before driving would seem to be better for the batter since the current is lower (3.3kw) vs charging it through the engine which can produce 30kw-40kw of power. I wonder if he would have had better outcomes in terms of battery health if he had done more miles on electric."
electricvehicles,3ctcg0,Solaterre,3,Fri Jul 10 21:55:21 2015 UTC,"If he's doing 150 of his 200 miles on the highway per day, it's a pretty good bet that he's spending a good deal of time in torque split mode that sends some of the power directly to the wheels.  You are right that the battery is always in the picture somewhere, but since his is a 2012, the ICE doesn't charge other than a little to keep it steady at the lower bound of its range; it's not getting 30kw or more for any sustained length of time."
electricvehicles,3ctcg0,ajswdf,0,Fri Jul 10 18:35:32 2015 UTC,"That's not true, the engine never drives the wheels except in certain rare circumstances (passing up a hill at freeway speeds).  *Edit: I'd like to add a source to make it more clear that the battery is being used at nearly all times."
electricvehicles,3ctcg0,AbandonedTrilby,4,Fri Jul 10 19:44:34 2015 UTC,"The engine will provide direct mechanical torque at steady state cruise at higher speeds (again assuming battery depleted). Not exclusively powering the wheels, but it is applying direct torque via the power split device. This operation is not ""rare"" and it doesn't require extreme demand like climbing a hill. As I stated before the battery still is indeed in play in this mode, so I don't think we are really disagreeing much here.   http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/10/chevy-volt-delivers-novel-two-motor-four-mode-extended-range-electric-drive-system-seamless-driver-e.html   Mode 4. High-Speed Extended-Range Propulsion (Engine Running). The blended two-motor electric propulsion strategy used at higher speeds in EV driving has also been adapted for extended-range driving. In this mode, the clutches that connect the generator/motor to both the engine and the ring gear are engaged, combining the engine and both motors to drive the Volt via the planetary gear set. All of the propulsion energy is seamlessly blended by the planetary gear set and sent to the final drive."

I'm thinking this will potentially be great for all of those leaf's that are coming off of lease and selling for the 11k ish range right now.

Most mechanical calculators were comparable in size to small desktop computers and have been rendered obsolete by the advent of the electronic calculator.  Surviving notes from Wilhelm Schickard in 1623 report that he designed and had built the earliest of the modern attempts at mechanising calculation. His machine was designed for multiplication and division (using 'Napier's bones') and had an innovative mechanical adding machine built into the base. The surviving notes do not make it clear whether Schickard's machine would have worked as well as he reported to Kepler and might well have jammed when a number of counters were forced to move simultaneously.  Two decades later in 1642 Blaise Pascal decisively solved this particular problem with his independent invention of a mechanical calculator. The comparative roles and significance of Pascal and Schickard's important inventions is discussed in much greater detail in Schickard versus Pascal: An Empty Debate?  Co-opted into his father's labour as tax collector in Rouen, Pascal designed the calculator to help in the large amount of tedious arithmetic required.;  it was called Pascal's Calculator or Pascaline.

Get the VIN of the car you want to buy, call up the internet sales manager at the dealer that has the car, and go from there.   It will feel a little scary buying something as large as a car via the internet, but remember - while this might be the first car you've bought online, it almost certainly isn't the first car they've sold online. They do this a lot more than you think, and already know how to make the process smooth.  Remember to confirm that you can get local servicing of your new EV. Generally if the dealer can't sell the car, they can't service it. I actually wanted to get an e-Golf, but VW was completely obstinate about servicing and I didn't want to have to ship it down to Portland for services.

How much the vehicle relies on electric determines whether it's an ""micro"", ""mild"", ""strong"", ""full"" hybrid.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain  Also you're right, talking about semantics is relatively unimportant :D"
electricvehicles,3c04b1,secondlamp,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:08:19 2015 UTC,"Hybrid vehicle drivetrain:       Hybrid vehicles are vehicles with two or more power sources in the drivetrain. There are many different types of hybrid vehicles, although only the gasoline-electric hybrid is currently commercially available.  Hybrids are classified by the division of power between sources; both sources may operate in parallel to simultaneously provide acceleration, or they may operate in series with one source exclusively providing the acceleration and the second being used to augment the first's power reserve. The sources can also be used in both series and parallel as needed, the vehicle being primarily driven by one source but the second capable of providing direct additional acceleration if required.  Current hybrids use both an internal combustion engine (ICE) and a battery/electric drive system (using ultracapacitors) to improve fuel consumption, emission, and performance. Electrically assisted pedal bicycles are a form of hybrid drive. Other combinations of energy storage and conversion are possible, although not yet in commercial production.

electricvehicles,3c04b1,pattimaus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:30:18 2015 UTC,"The drive train would be fully electric, but the car would not be 100% electric since it had an ICE in it. Though in my mind it is not as important as the drivetrain.  I think it is good to make distinction when the drivetrain is fully electric or not. You make a electric drivetrain car to a fully electric car by simply removing the ICE generator. This is significantly easier, than transforming a hybrid ICE/electric drivetrain to a fully electric car. You need to fully re-engineer the drivetrain to do it.  So all of the electric drivetrain range extender cars are clearly stop gaps on the road to a fully electric car. Instead the hybrid drivetrain cars will newer be fully electric cars and are mainly about ICE fuel efficiency.  So anytime any manufacturer makes a fully electric drivetrain car we should be happy, because it is a battery boost away from being a full electric. Also you can drive one as full electric, if you want to. Just order the ECU to newer start the generator."

BMW i8 has a 98 kW electric motor, BMW i3 has a 125 kW electric motor. These are hybrid reluctance / permanent magnet synchronous machines. Brusa offers 220 kW hybrid synchronous motors. There is absolutely no basis to the statement that ""Induction motors always have been the standard for high power motors, and will be for the foreseeable future"". High performance motors in EVs have tended to be PMSM rather than induction."
electricvehicles,3c06mh,TheScriptKiddie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:00:13 2015 UTC,"Permanent magnet synchronous motors (aka brushless DC motors) have been common in hybrid EVs because they are cheap and produce loads of torque at low RPM. However, induction motors are more efficient especially at large power levels and are more compact. Everything from stationary power tools (lathes, mills, drill presses) to electric trains use induction motors, not to mention Tesla's cars. Switched reluctantance is a cool technology but we're not exactly depending on it. Induction motors could satisfy our needs if all of the rare earth metals suddenly dried up."
electricvehicles,3c06mh,TheScriptKiddie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:34:09 2015 UTC,"Permanent magnet synchronous motors (aka brushless DC motors)   PMSM and BLDC are NOT the same thing. Firstly, PMSM has a sinusoidal Back EMF, BLDC has a Trapezoidal back EMF. Current into a BLDC motor when controlled with a motor controller will resemble a square wave and simple hall-effect sensors can be used for feedback. PMSM requires sinusoidal current and a proper resolver to give accurate rotor position feedback. Both PMSM and Induction can be controlled via Field Orientated Control. That means the controllers are very similar and indeed most motor controllers that support PMSM will also support Induction (and vice versa).  Axial Flux PMSM also has the greatest power density (as my source shows) and indeed most electric racing vehicles tend to be PMSM. These include: Formula E and Drive eO PP03. Highest performance motors tend to be Axial flux, such as this:  http://www.enstroj.si/images/stories/emrax_268_tech_data_table_dec_2014.pdf  And:  http://www.yasamotors.com/products/yasa-400/  For stationary power tools and electric trains the requirements are different to EVs (less focus on weight) and more focus on cost. Induction Motors can also connect to the grid more easily than a PMSM can."
electricvehicles,3c06mh,tech01x,2,Sat Jul 4 10:51:33 2015 UTC,"If we're going to get technical, then I would argue that a permanent magnet synchronous motor is the same as a brushless DC motor. Not analogous, literally the same hardware with a different label. The only difference is the controller, overlapping sinusoidal vs trapezoidal. You can take a brushless DC motor and connect it to an AC synchronous motor controller, and vice versa.  Also, drag racers tend to favor brushed AC motors. Forgive me, I don't know what they are really called, but they are the kind where the rotor and stator are both electromagnets. Permanent magnet motors are also common because they are cheap secondhand, but for all out power they are not king.  I'm not saying that induction motors are the be-all-end-all motor technology for electric vehicles. I'm just saying that they're good enough to save us from the inevitable shortages of rare earth minerals."

Clearly, the biggest motor that Tesla uses is 310 kW, so looking at a 50 kW motor is definitely not in the same league. As a result, if you aren't looking at purpose built EV motors, the specific cases may fall very far from the general cases. I would have expected a paper like this to have sourced the actual specifications of various motors from Nissan, GM, Renault, BMW, Tesla and maybe others.  Note this blog post by Wally Rippel of both AeroVironment and Tesla about AC induction motors:  http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/induction-versus-dc-brushless-motors  From Tesla's perspective, their AC induction motors are cheaper than equivalent permanent magnet motors. Efficiency is also better optimized across the performance spectrum.

The only reason I even got a wireless charger in the first place was because my old phone's USB port broke and I was able to get a replacement back cover with wireless charging for $6 and a charging pad for $15, which let me use the phone for about half a year longer before getting a new phone. I only bought a charging coil insert for my new phone just because I had Amazon credit available and it was ~$10 so I could still use the charging pad if I wanted. I don't even use it that often because it's pretty slow at ~600mA (limitation of the cheap adapter I bought) compared to ~1.2-1.8A with a cord and the phone has to be placed just right and it doesn't charge if it gets bumped out of place. I can't imagine it being that reliable in the car, I have to assume the phone would slide around due to turns and such.  It's a nice option because it gives you another option for charging if the USB port breaks, but I'm less excited about it than I was when I first started using wireless charging.

For example:   Low ball trade-in offers with a ""rebate check"" from the manufacturer that makes it up on the backend. Expensive ""dealer-installed option packages"" for features that are currently included in base price or packages. Steeper discounts on selling price when taking manufacturer financing, sold at an inflated rate to offset.   I agree that EVs are a bit of a boondoggle for wealthier consumers. For example, if you price out a 100k Tesla and consider federal tax credit, state sales tax exemption and the gas savings over a typical 5-year ownership cycle your out-of-pocket money is $82.5k. By comparison, buying a $75k-list gas car and paying WA sales tax, you'll end up spending $82.5k.

No one has 500 volt battery packs, so in reality, with 350 to 400 volt battery packs, we're talking 70 to 80 kW in the real world. So even when they expand out to ""100 kW"" it will be slow and obsolete.  At some point, both CCS Combo 1 and CHAdeMO will have to be redesigned to handle more than 200 amps to actually support SAE Level 3 DC charging. The plug and sockets themselves are design limited to 200 amps. Tesla Model S's can already take 340 amps reportedly. The problem will then be backwards compatibility - we will see how disruptive this will be to handle legacy EV's that can't handle > 200 amp Level 3 DC charging.

electricvehicles,3br920,ViperRT10Matt,5,Wed Jul 1 14:37:57 2015 UTC,"A lot of the talk here will be on whether or not this car beats Tesla's Model III to the market, but in my opinion, this is moot as these two cars will ultimately serve two distinct price brackets. The Bolt is based on the economy car Sonic, whereas the Model III will adopt an pricing strategy where you need five figures worth of options/trim to get the car you actually want, just like the BMW 3 series that it is benchmarked against. Practically speaking, the Model IIIs you see on the road will likely cost up around $50k."
electricvehicles,3br920,RandyBeaman,4,Wed Jul 1 18:10:19 2015 UTC,"True, but I bet there will still be a lot of people happy to buy a base Model 3."

electricvehicles,3br920,badcatdog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:47:31 2015 UTC,"This also assumes they will hit their pricing goal, which I am skeptical of to say the least."
electricvehicles,3br920,badcatdog,2,Wed Jul 1 19:49:46 2015 UTC,"The base M3 should be cheaper with maybe a tad more range.  Just what features/trim do you think the Bolt will have that are superior to the base M3?  Certainly I expect higher spec M3 will be popular, as the MS is too large for many people (particularly in Japan).  I remember some 3rd party estimate the average price of an M3 would be $60k?"
electricvehicles,3br920,badcatdog,3,Thu Jul 2 02:14:24 2015 UTC,"(Edit: Formatting)  To clarify, I don't expect the base Bolt to be loaded. Also I would confidently guess that the M3 will offer up sells that the Bolt doesn't as it aims higher upmarket, giving it a higher price ceiling.   Musk has said on the record that certain things standard on the MS will be options on the M3. Looking at the list, I'd say that would be as follows, given that everything listed is not standard on a new 328i.     Feature BMW Price GM Price    Paint other than black or white $550 standard for all but two colors   Parking sensors/camera $950 $575   Folding rear seats $495 standard   Power front seats with memory $995 n/a   Auto folding mirrors n/a n/a   Motorized door handles n/a n/a   Navigation $2150 $500   Keyless entry with remote start Requires premium pkg standard   Telematics / control via app Requires tech pkg standard   Bluetooth integration $500 standard   Anti-theft $400 standard    Leather is $1400 from both but GM includes seat heaters, BMW charges an additional $500 for heaters.   Overall GM seems somewhat more generous with standard equipment, and what is optional is priced a good deal lower.   Supercharging is a separate discussion but I have an incredibly hard time believing $35000 will include it given the the $70k S60 did not. Regardless GM is a total goose egg on that front so far.   So that's just stuff that mostly used to be standard on an MS. Now add on the other popular MS options (premium audio, autopilot, sunroof) and you will likely end up with a far more luxurious M3 than Bolt, but also far more expensive.   Which brings me back to the point I've been trying to make all along that practically speaking, the amount of cross shopping between these cars will be minimal. Bolt buyers will likely get a solid econo-car in the $30s, and better heeled buyers can have solid entry level luxury for $15k more."

Having driven an i3 I can say it's very impressive behind the wheel (the amazing job BMW did to keep it light really comes through from the driver's seat), but I think regardless I'd have a tough time justifying the premium for one of these versus the closeout deals right now on a '15 Volt."

Remember how hot your phone gets while it's charging?    How about how hot your phone gets when you are on constant wifi?  All the charge/discharge causes the batteries to heat up, sometimes too hot like the owners of Leafs in AZ.  You want cooling to keep the batteries cool to ensure they live longer.

What I expect is for most public chargers to remain J1772 in North America for quite a while.   I have never seen a CHAdeMO station that didn't also have one or two ordinary J1772 EVSE's available.    That's how they built out the West Coast Electric Highway, for example, and it's standard at most Nissan dealerships.  SAE Combo is basically a J1772 plug combined with a DC fast charge plug.    So it would make total and complete sense to have an adapter that would let an SAE Combo plug adapt to provide AC power to a J1772-only car.  I haven't seen one yet, but then I haven't seen an SAE Combo charging station yet.    The only two vehicles I know can use them are the Chevy Spark and the BMW i3.

electricvehicles,3bbns8,greywizard77,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:50:58 2015 UTC,"We've known that we can hybridize Li-ion with graphene for a while. Pure graphene super capacitors still have, and always will have, issues with energy density. While they can pick up energy very quickly, they don't hold very much and can discharge just as quickly. Silicon has issues with degradation, meaning battery life is short and they damage easily.  About the best we're going to get out of graphene hybridization is a Li-ion with half the charge time or a massive change is infrastructure to accommodate more frequent charging of lower capacity batteries in a fraction of the time. Personally I would prefer the latter. Would you use a battery with 3 hours of charge if it took only 30 seconds to charge to full?"
electricvehicles,3bbns8,dogphlap,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:04:36 2015 UTC,After a while we all become jaded with a battery break through at least once every fortnight but this has a better chance than many. It's no secret that silicon would be a better cathode material than that currently used if it were not for the physical damage sustained as the material is forced to expand to accommodate lithium ions which results in a usable charge discharge cycle life of less than ten before the cathode falls apart. That's what Samsung are claiming to have solved. After all everything is better with graphene.

It sounds like you want a portable DCFC, essentially something to take high-power AC and turn it into ChaDeMo or SAE Combo. Here's a relatively small DCFC- maybe a super-adventurous person would stick one in their trunk and come up with a custom Mennekes cable to feed it the 3-phase AC. However, it's way too big to carry on a motorcycle.  https://transportevolved.com/2015/04/08/siemens-unveils-all-new-wall-mounted-24-kw-electric-car-charging-station-that-can-run-from-single-phase-power/  I'm sorry, but any device capable of putting out 22kW is not going to be a consumer-grade device with a pre-made Mennekes inlet.

electricvehicles,3b2s8z,paulwesterberg,3,Thu Jun 25 16:53:40 2015 UTC,"The key to ""supercharger speed"" is the 85kWh pack, which the Bolt clearly won't have anything close to at its size. If we approximate a 40kWh pack, charging at 87.5 is still over 2C, which is higher than the superchargers currently push."
electricvehicles,3b2s8z,ViperRT10Matt,3,Thu Jun 25 17:02:54 2015 UTC,A 40kW pack won't provide 200 miles of range(unless you drive at 35mph on flat ground) but it is about what I expect GM to put in the Bolt given their price target.
electricvehicles,3b2s8z,paulwesterberg,3,Thu Jun 25 17:17:47 2015 UTC,"200 miles of range is probably for the ZEV credit type III classification to get 4 credits, which is on the UDDS standard. The 2013 Nissan Leaf gets 110.9 miles on the UDDS standard.  So EPA 5 cycle range is more likely to be 160 miles with a somewhere around 35 kWh usable capacity in the pack. It is unlikely that GM will put a single watt higher than they think they need to hit ZEV type III rating."
electricvehicles,3b2s8z,tech01x,2,Thu Jun 25 18:51:03 2015 UTC,"I agree, I bet the next-gen Leaf is also targeting 200 miles of ""urban dynamometer driving cycle"" range.  There have been rumors that the 2016 Leaf would launch with 30kWh, but that won't meet the ZEV ||| requirements so it will be interesting to see if they delay it or attempt to launch 40kWh packs sooner."
electricvehicles,3b2s8z,paulwesterberg,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:48:15 2015 UTC,"You don't think a car that small could do an average of 5 miles/kWh?    Even so they'd need to add additional headroom to keep life gentle for the battery, so figure a 50kWh pack, still not enough to take much more than 100kw during a charge.  Telsa will likely be facing a similar issue when the Model 3 arrives- ""Supercharging"" won't mean nearly the same thing that it does in a S85."
electricvehicles,3b2s8z,ViperRT10Matt,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:50:24 2015 UTC,"You don't think a car that small could do an average of 5 miles/kWh?   Actually I do - according to carwings I used to average 4.5-5 in my leaf, in lower speed urban/suburban driving. The problem is that you can't regularly run a battery from 100% to 0% without ruining it. And the Leafs range at 65-70mph highway speed is not so great. Overall the Leaf is good for about 85miles max if you drive it carefully.  The S60 actually pulls a max of 90-100kW - so Tesla already has protocol in place to limit the max power levels for smaller/older batteries.  I just worry that GM and Nissan are painting themselves into a corner by installing medium-fast chargers that won't be adequate for long distance EVs."
electricvehicles,3b2s8z,paulwesterberg,2,Thu Jun 25 18:06:40 2015 UTC,"The S60 actually pulls a max of 90-100kW   Right, exactly my point. SAE Combo can support up to 100 kW, so with anything smaller than a 60kWh pack, SAE combo won't be the limiting factor on a car this size.  If they ultimately come out with a Caddy with a bigger pack, then yes the charger would be the limiting factor.  To be clear, I'm not arguing that Tesla's standard isn't better (it clearly is), but rather that on packs below 60kWh, SAE Combo can charge just as fast and doesn't put the Bolt at a disadvantage."
electricvehicles,3b2s8z,ViperRT10Matt,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:36:30 2015 UTC,"24kWh gets you 80 miles in the Leaf, so it's more likely that it'll be 50-60kWh."

A power plant produces energy much more efficiently and an EV uses that energy so efficiently that it almost always produces less CO2 then an ICE vehicle. In the unlikely worst-case scenario, where 100% of your electricity comes from a coal power plant, it is about the same as an ICE vehicle."

First off I have a little trouble figuring out why energy should be more polluted at night. The only renewable energy that has lowered function at night is solar energy, which at the current state only covers about 3% of the total energy production in US. This would be a really weird argument. Now since EV’s gets its power directly from the power grid the cars are as “clean” as the energy produced. If the total energy production was generated from 100% renewable energy then the car would also be 100% clean (Tank 2 wheel). On the other side a normal car running on fuel would generate the same amount of pollution whether the energy production is generated by renewable energy or not."

electricvehicles,3b1r4d,rav4evdriver,3,Fri Jun 26 08:54:25 2015 UTC,"It's not true that electricity generated at night is ""wasted"". The power plants produce the exact amount of power required by all connected loads. Plugging in your EV increases the output of the power station. It's been proven time and time again that even a dirty coal plant produces less pollution and CO2 per mile than a gasoline car. Greener power sources like nuclear and renewable are obviously better yet."
electricvehicles,3b1r4d,OompaOrangeFace,2,Thu Jun 25 14:16:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, energy during non-peak periods can be wasted.  When you feed more fuel into your car using the gas (or power) pedal, it goes faster. When you stop giving it gas (or power), it coasts - you get free energy. If you give the car gas (or power) and then suddenly brake to come to a stop instead of coasting, you lose a large amount of potential energy - even if your car has regenerative braking.  The same is true of power plants. To serve customers, they need to keep their facilities fueled at a certain rate. If demand drops, the power company doesn't put the brakes on the generators or disconnect solar panels or stop all the windmills - power does indeed continue to be generated and is wasted.  Similarly, it is less efficient for a power company to ramp up to meet demand than maintain a steady power state, just like your car uses much more energy to go from 0-65 than it does to maintain 65 on a level road. As such, power companies will generate above the level of demand so that they don't have to ramp generators up and down. (In addition, they do this to prevent brownouts or blackouts when they cannot meet demand.)  That being said, it is entirely correct that powering an electric vehicle on coal-generated electricity is likely to be net equivalent or cleaner than using gasoline.   These studies never take into account that people might charge their cars using solar power, despite many of us EV owners doing exactly that."
electricvehicles,3b1r4d,rav4evdriver,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:36:52 2015 UTC,"Sure, a power plant takes a certain amount of energy input to keep the generators spinning, but if there is zero load on the generators then it won't take much fuel (coal, natural gas, etc.) to keep them turning. There isn't some giant resistor bank that dissipates excess production."
electricvehicles,3b1r4d,OhWellWhaTheHell,3,Thu Jun 25 17:49:20 2015 UTC,"That's just not how it works.   The power company tries to operate the main generators at a constant speed, which generates a constant amount of energy, regardless of load. In the event load rises, the power company provides additional fuel to the generator to generate more power, but if it is not possible to ramp up the generators quickly enough to meet demand, peak load generator stations designed to come online quickly to meet the load will do so - at the cost of burning enough fuel to bring them online.  As an alternative to trying to meet demand dynamically, utilities absolutely do generate substantial amounts of excess power so that they can keep their equipment running at high levels of efficiency. No, there aren't resistors. They attempt to store that power for later use in a variety of ways. Pay close attention to the section on load leveling."
electricvehicles,3b1r4d,OompaOrangeFace,2,Fri Jun 26 03:00:51 2015 UTC,"(@ Oompa) rav4's explanation rocks!  However that flexible term energy is muddying up the works. ""The power company tries to operate the main generators at a constant speed, which generates a constant amount of energy, regardless of load."" Here I would think of energy as taking the place of constant voltage and frequency. At a constant voltage and frequency you can generate power or even consume power depending on the generator's capability.  Base load generators such as nuclear, coal, and oil run exactly as rav4evdriver says. They often have contracts to run a specific amount of power to ensure they can run their equipment at efficiency.   But then there are real time market generators, spinning reserve, capacity agreements, and it just becomes really complex because in any given system there are hundreds of generators with any of five fuels. (Counting the whole renewables group as one diverse fuel, for no other reason beyond I am tired.)   Anyhow hope that helps. Thanks for the explanation and sources rav4evdriver!  Edit: Some examples"
electricvehicles,3b1r4d,jeremyloveslinux,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:59:17 2015 UTC,"I hope that someone else can jump in this discussion to help clear this up. I'm pretty sure that you're incorrect. Just because the generator is spinning at a constant RPM doesn't mean that it's generating power. The coils have to be energized in order to generate power. The amount of power that a generator produces can be varied independently of the RPM.  I'm not an electrical engineer, but this is my understanding. I'd love to be more educated on this subject. ;  From ""load leveling"": Power plants can be run below their normal output, with the facility to increase the amount they generate almost instantaneously. This is termed 'spinning reserve'.  I believe this is the concept I'm referring to. The generators are spinning, but not outputting their maximum current."
electricvehicles,3b1r4d,jeremyloveslinux,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:09:18 2015 UTC,"Check out some of my comments above, but yes, there is spinning reserve when plants have the ability to ramp up quickly from low or medium power levels. Torque on the rotor is what produces electrical power. The coils on the rotor serve a different purpose of generating (or absorbing) reactive power, which has more to do with voltage and power transfer stability."
electricvehicles,3b1r4d,jeremyloveslinux,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:42:16 2015 UTC,"The power company does operate the generators at a constant speed, however it is the torque produced by the prime mover (steam turbine, combustion turbine, water turbine, etc) that is actually transferring energy. You can have a generator connected to the grid with no load, it will just spin because it is locked to the rotating magnetic field of the grid."
electricvehicles,3b1r4d,tech01x,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:37:39 2015 UTC,"Power engineer here. We control generators and follow load by dispatching them to different power levels or even shutting them down entirely at times of low load. There are power plants that run at a constant output all the time, called ""base load"" units and do indeed run at a mostly steady power state. However, there are many plants that do not do this. At the most extreme are peakers, plants that can start up and run in as little as a few minutes. They are typically smaller and more inefficient, but allow for extra capacity during higher loads (like summer AC use). A bit less extreme would be a load following plant that adjusts it's output during the day, but stays on at a lower level throughout the night. Don't forget you have things like solar and wind that are at the whim of their own sources of ""fuel"" and will generate whenever it's available. Faster starting and ramping plants (while also being more efficient than ever!) are being installed to help deal with intermittent renewables.  I can tell you that if the power plants continued to generate with no load into the electric grid, the grid's frequency would rise out of control very quickly and trip a lot of steam based power plants because of their sensitivity to speed variations. Keep in mind that AC motor/generator speeds are proportional to frequency. The grid must maintain the generator to load balance exactly because frequency will rise or decay if it is not maintained, and cause a collapse.  Finally, power companies invested in large base load capacity will typically sell off power during times of low load to other utilities. In fact, some plants are owned by several different companies or municipalities and they will coordinate the power of their systems to use the power effectively 24 hours a day. There's still a good amount of load at night.  TLDR: Nobody just runs power plants without load. It would be incredibly wasteful."
electricvehicles,3b1r4d,OompaOrangeFace,2,Sat Jun 27 19:28:07 2015 UTC,There are plenty of circumstances where there isn't a perfect fit between demand and generation - nuclear and coal are examples where the throttling variance isn't minute enough to respond quickly to demand changes. Basically anything that relies on heat to drive a steam turbine generator is unlikely to handle much cycling variance.  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_following_power_plant  There are times at night that the per hour spot price of electricity goes negative due to surplus production.
electricvehicles,3b1r4d,OhWellWhaTheHell,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:17:56 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm not an expert on this so someone please help me out. My understanding is that they don't/can't generate ""extra"" electricity. It's possible that steam energy is wasted, but I don't think that there is actually excess electricity that magically flows to nowhere. If it's being generated it has to go somewhere. It's a zero sum equation."
electricvehicles,3b1r4d,kangaroostew,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:50:56 2015 UTC,"Its late so I expect mistakes...but here goes. Power plants are able to generate excess electricity within tolerances built into the system both at the power plant level and on the grid itself. When generation exceeds demand it can be absorbed by capacitors along the grid system (very short term), directed to an adjacent grid, or it results in undesirable conditions on the grid such as voltage spikes. To my knowledge large scale grid storage is not in place anywhere yet. ( California is requiring projects be built to accomplish this. )  If a power plant continually over-generates they can drive the wholesale price down encouraging other plants to reduce output or even go offline. If all the generators ignored those prices and ran anyway, Grid operators would direct them to reduce to protect grid stability. If the power plants said, ""hell no we love the current output level"" for some strange reason, they would eventually push the voltage or frequency out of range and a relay or circuit breaker would trip their unit offline.  Additionally Grid operators can dispatch Demand resources to consume the excess electricity with manufacturing equipment or lighting on a commercial scale. I think most of the time the demand resources are used to curtail excess demand rather than raise load on an oversupplied system.  Rav4evdriver hit majority of the points in a clear way as well below."

You can put the same amount of energy into the battery in 10 minutes at 40 kW that a 3.3 kW charger can in two hours. Typically chargers are limited by the amount of power that can be drawn from the supply, whereas a motor can generate as much power in regen as it can use in drive."

electricvehicles,3ahiha,cryptoanarchy,2,Fri Jun 26 03:16:59 2015 UTC,"This is what bothers me about the charging rate limitation of 3.3kW on my Volt. GM claims that to have put in a higher-wattage charger would cost a ton more and use fatter wiring, but that makes no sense given that the power from the motor regen is AC just like wall power, which suggests to me that the rectifier/etc are already capable of handling more. Unless I'm misunderstanding the car's engineering setup and the regen system is separate from the charger system (in which case, why?), the only extra cost would be slightly fatter wiring from the charging port to the charger, a distance of maybe 3 feet."
electricvehicles,3ahiha,tekym,11,Sat Jun 20 12:59:11 2015 UTC,"I can answer that one for you! The reason regen can handle higher power is that the AC coming from the motor is processed through the drive inverter back into the battery, and is at higher voltage than the grid's AC supply. When your car is plugged in, it goes through an entirely different device, the OBC (on board charger) which has its own limitations. The drive inverter can't be used for plug-in charging for a variety of reasons- voltage, frequency, phase are all different between the AC coming from the motor and the AC coming from the wall.  You know GM would cut the OBC to save cost in a heartbeat if they could."
electricvehicles,3ahiha,ElectricNed,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:14:57 2015 UTC,"This is actually what I was wondering. Yes, the AC from the house has less output than regen, but 3.3kW is still not making use of 100% of the home electricity."
electricvehicles,3ahiha,ElectricNed,2,Sat Jun 20 19:46:27 2015 UTC,"The reason is that although more than 3.3kW is available, the hardware needed to convert power from house AC to battery level DC has a high cost per watt. The semiconductors, inductors, and capacitors used for this are often several dollars a pop, even in great volume, and the OBC already has dozens/hundreds of power-handling components.  This is the same reason that Level 3 / DCQC chargers are so rare and expensive- high power is high cost.   tl;dr it costs a non-trivial amount to make a 3.3kW charger and about twice that to make a 6.6kW charger."
electricvehicles,3ahiha,IdleChatMeister,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:08:28 2015 UTC,"Question. What if instead of feeding current to the batteries, one could use a grid powered motor to spin the electric motor of the car which in turn it would charge the batteries. Considering the losses, would it at least have the advantage of charging the car faster? Would the energy losses through all the transfers be too great to make the proposition feasible?"
electricvehicles,3ahiha,ElectricNed,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:14:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the drawbacks in waste, weight penalty, complexity, moving parts, and cost would outweigh the cost of just paying for more semiconductors in the OBC."

electricvehicles,3a7d69,ElectricNed,2,Thu Jun 18 13:59:36 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on the Leaf! I'm going to assume your car has the 6.6kW charger, and so can use a charge rate of up to 27.5A. I'd recommend getting an EVSE with at least that much capacity, so you car can charge itself at the fastest possible rate. One thing I'd want to clarify is if GP requires a 40A circuit supplying the EVSE, or a 40A capable EVSE. The difference is important because continious loads, like cars charging, are only allowed to use 80% of the circuit's rating. So a 40A EVSE would require a 50A circuit.  Either way, I would recommend a 40A capable EVSE on a 50A circuit. You can have an electrician install a NEMA 14-50 outlet and get an EVSE with a plug on it (instead of hard-wiring one), then just plug it in. Your Leaf will be happy to have the 27.5A available that it wants, and if you have a future EV that can charge faster, you have a 50A circuit available for that.

electricvehicles,3a6rll,jackiejack1,7,Wed Jun 17 17:49:58 2015 UTC,"Flat pack batteries are typically put in cars with new chassis designed from the ground up as an EV with space for a flat pack implemented as part of the design. Chevy and other manufacturers (Ford), to save money, are using frames from existing models to build their cars, which means they need to find somewhere to put the batteries. Chevy chose the transmission tunnel and under the rear seats (thus the T shape) for the Volt since the Volt doesn't use a traditional transmission. Ford and others have been putting the batteries in the trunk, since their cars still use standard transmissions, this cuts down quite a bit on trunk and pass-through space. If Chevy's new Bolt is on a new platform, then it will likely be a flat-pack setup like the Tesla's or the BMW i3."
electricvehicles,3a6rll,hainesk,2,Wed Jun 17 20:07:22 2015 UTC,Well the GM EV1 fromt the 90s was a complete from the ground up designed to be an EV and they used a T-Cell in it which is what is puzzling to me...
electricvehicles,3a6rll,geo38,-2,Wed Jun 17 22:29:10 2015 UTC,"Why puzzling? The design of a vehicle has so many constraints and competing requirements, who knows why the EV1 went with a T shaped battery. Does it matter?"
electricvehicles,3a6rll,hainesk,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:58:13 2015 UTC,"Basically I'm curious why its only GM who uses this setup regardless of the type of electric car (fully bespoke ev1 or a compliance vehicle aka spark ev).  I mean literally every other industry EV maker uses flat pack except for GM, do they have a patent on a T alignment?"
electricvehicles,3a6rll,swanny101,2,Thu Jun 18 05:46:10 2015 UTC,"It's not only GM who uses this setup, they just happened to arrange their batteries into a T shape. Ford uses a similar style batteries for their hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles, but puts them in the trunk. Honda as well for their Accord plug-in. The Volt has about twice the capacity of those vehicles. The Volt borrowed heavily from the EV1, and the Gen 1 EV1 used lead-acid batteries, not LI-Ion. That's likely the reason for their shape vs a flat-pack. Also, they only got so far as NiMH batteries before they discontinued the car, and those had some issues, I'm wondering if they tried to keep the batteries as central and protected as possible in the car, because they were afraid of road debris possibly damaging the batteries."
electricvehicles,3a6rll,Anderlan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:44:41 2015 UTC,Actually there is no reason a t style battery couldn't be used on a Ford as the tunnel is only used in 4 wheel drive models (non hybrid). If you watch the ntsb crash test videos you can see the tunnel is completely empty.   The reasons why they avoided it are probably cooling and battery safety.

electricvehicles,39zwe3,clint_l,6,Tue Jun 16 03:37:42 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, no.  While Telsa's patents are open, the Supercharger network is not and Telsa would expect some sort of compensation from GM to access their network.  A Supercharger can provide anywhere from 90-135 kW.  Outside of the Model S, no other EV is able to accept this much power.  Thus, anything other than a Model S would have longer charge times and occupy that charger for longer periods of time."

With a pack voltage around 400 volts, the max the Soul EV can pull from a 100 kW CHAdeMO plug is 80kW with a more realistic rate of 75 KW at lower SoC. Going above 200 amps is going to require a new standard with a new plug. Note the claimed charging time to 80%."

electricvehicles,39zwe3,Zok2000,5,Tue Jun 16 15:47:09 2015 UTC,You would be better off just asking your employer for access to a 120v plug at your office. That would likely charge your volt to full or close to full during your work day.

electricvehicles,39zwe3,JohnnyMnemo,3,Tue Jun 16 07:20:25 2015 UTC,"The Bolt and the Model 3 come out in a few years and will have a similar 200 mile range.  There's no way I'm even going to consider the Bolt when with the Model 3 I have access to the increasingly expanding Tesla supercharging network.    I live in Cincinnati and there's already superchargers in every major city near mine; Dayton, Columbus, Lexington, and Indianapolis.  I have family in Louisville and I'm hoping for a supercharger there by the time the Model 3 hits the road."
electricvehicles,39zwe3,mburke6,4,Tue Jun 16 11:44:20 2015 UTC,"Two points:   All GM has to do is tell every dealer that they have to install level 3 chargers. Within a year, solely due to the amount of real estate they have immediate access to, they could have a network of chargers that would exceed Tesla's, especially in rural areas. Note that this doesn't solve the issue that these chargers would be inferior, and GM would likely have problems pulling this off, but still, it could be done. Many people with the 60 kWh pack found road trips via supercharging to be impractical, due to the smaller pack requiring more frequent stops, and the smaller pack's inability to charge as fast. Now note that the Model 3 will likely have an even smaller capacity pack due to its smaller size. 20 minutes at supercharger is not going to get you anything approaching the 180 miles that the 85 kwh pack can pull off."
electricvehicles,39zwe3,ViperRT10Matt,4,Tue Jun 16 13:56:45 2015 UTC,"Two points:   Nobody wants to hang out at a dealership waiting for a charge. Tesla superchargers are usually located next to restaurants like the Two Brothers Roundhouse brewpub I visited in Aurora, IL last week. The car had 150miles before I placed my order and was fully charged by the time I was finished. Or you could get some bad coffee at a GM dealership. If you read /r/TeslaMotors you will see that there are several S60 owners who have traveled cross country in their vehicles. Superchargers are usually located less than 150miles apart so traveling between chargers is not a problem."
electricvehicles,39zwe3,paulwesterberg,4,Tue Jun 16 15:12:52 2015 UTC,"I agree that hanging out at a GM dealership is not ideal, but rather just indicating that GM could provide a way to assure access to charging if it wanted to. Also those wouldn't be the only locations, there would still be SAE Combo chargers elsewhere and in more desirable locations, the dealership locations would just be a minimum saftey net.  And I never disputed that the S60 can be used for road trips, but just that the combination of the smaller pack and lower charge rate make it less favorable to the point where it's definitely been noticed and pointed out, and that the Model 3 having an even smaller pack will make it less favorable still."
electricvehicles,39zwe3,ViperRT10Matt,3,Tue Jun 16 15:25:18 2015 UTC,"Nissan tried to get dealers to install chademo chargers. AFAIK the program has mostly been a failure. None of the Nissan dealers in my state have bothered to install them. The L2 chargers that they do have are often ICEd, being hogged by dealer vehicles or broken.   Based on GMs failure to sell the volt at many of its rural dealerships I think there will need to be a serious reducation and marketing effort before their dealers buy into EVs."
electricvehicles,39zwe3,paulwesterberg,2,Tue Jun 16 15:37:15 2015 UTC,"Yep, definitely a valid concern. I really don't see a realistic way GM can match the Supercharger advantage. I think the only hope the Bolt has to succeed is if it substantially bests the Model 3 on standard equipment and Musk misses his price goal, giving it an apples-to-apples selling price $10k more more below the Model 3. I think real-world configuration price (likely approaching $50k for a Model 3) will make them cross-shopped way less than people are expecting."

electricvehicles,39zwe3,pattimaus,2,Wed Jun 17 05:22:17 2015 UTC,"That's because it was a voluntary program.

electricvehicles,39zwe3,w4y,0,Tue Jun 16 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"You assume that the Model 3 will be able to make use of the SC network.    While that will probably be technically true, consider that even the least-expensive 60kwh Model S needs to add a $2K SC package to have access.  If Musk is going to charge a 60kwh model S owner, I'm going to guess that Model 3s won't have free access.  How much it is for them remains to be seen--will it be a $2K add on?  Or will he unlock a pay-as-you-go option so you can only buy it as needed?  Personally I hope for the latter, as I will probably only want to use it 3 or 4 times a year, so $2K is a bit steep.  Also if it's pay-as-you-go then he might be able to limit saturation of the stations, which will be more of a problem when he's shipping 500K Model 3s per year.  Anyways, the SC network is a compelling distinctive advantage to Tesla ownership as long as it remains available and reasonably priced.  Why by a Bolt with the same specs as a Model 3, even if using the SC requires a upcharge?  The SC network largely eliminates any road-trip range anxiety."
electricvehicles,39zwe3,JohnnyMnemo,5,Tue Jun 16 14:03:42 2015 UTC,"The s60 is not longer for sale, it has been replaced by the 70D which has AWD and includes supercharging."

If you take a normal amount of road trips (3-4 per year), even if you have the car ten years, the math is easy to show that those supercharging uses end up being very expensive at $2000."

And you keep the car for 10 years.  2000 / 10years / 12chargesPerYear =  $16.67   I don't know how much you pay for gas, but 17 bucks is a pretty cheap compared to a tank of gas."

However, battery powered cars with a backup gasoline engines are not showing that promise.  You can try to cite that the BMW has one and that its the same technology used in trains!  But that doesnt counter the fact that its expensive and inefficient when used in a car.  Keep in mind, Im not saying its junk, It seems to work fine.  Its the technology behind it which should not be invested in unless of course you want the single luxury it provides.  As a thought experiment explore why a hybrid has value (gasoline engine with electric assist)?  Why did it rise to prominence?  How much less trouble is it to add a battery and electric motor to a gas engine?  Is it cheaper, what are teh most expensive parts of a car?  What about cost savings?  What about in 5-10 years when electric cars have plenty of range, will that hybrid still be a good buy?"

My point however is that what bearing does that have on whether that model is a good compromise today?   You sound like you are saying ""this won't be the way things will be in the future, therefore it's silly to get today"". But today, batteries are still expensive, and I actually prefer the model of buying just as much battery as one needs for daily use (50 miles being plenty for most people) and letting an inexpensive gas motor (not sure why you think it adds so much to the cost when similarly configured Volts and Leaf cost about the same) handle the rest.  I don't think that's any less offensive than being limited to 80 miles per drive, in fact I find it far more favorable."

With more money backing it you see more attention or more innovation.  Upgrades will be more frequent and more comprehensive, including recalls.  The community support, web forums after market parts will be better.  With a greater market share you get more competition, repairs get cheaper, newer models provide more for less.  Its the better place to be.  If you are doing a 2-3 year lease and only care about the luxury of extended range on your electric motorized car this conversation doesnt matter to you.  If you care about the underlying technology and are attempting to make more educated, better financial decisions this would be a topic of concern.

As far as whether you wanna wait, I would go in and talk to the dealer about what offers they may have for taking their 2015 inventory. You should also consider your actual driving needs as far as range. If the 80ish miles is good enough for you per day, I'd go with the Leaf, if you think you might need more range I'd go with a Volt. I have a Volt and because of my commute I haven't filled my tank since November.   Either way I'd only recommend leasing instead of buying anyways.

electricvehicles,39w87g,Quality_Bullshit,35,Mon Jun 15 08:32:23 2015 UTC,"I think you are missing the fundamental reason why everyone but Tesla is choosing to approach the ""battery problem"" differently.    (Full disclosure: I work in the industry, but not for Tesla)    Tesla's battery solution is driven primarily by current state of the art technology.  As a startup company that lacks the huge amount of capital available to other automakers, Tesla cannot choose a slightly sub optimal solution now for a greater pay off later.    Other automakers are invested in the prismatic cell format because it is fundamentally better than the 18650 cylinders.  Think about it, can you pack more circles into something or rectangles?  The prismatic format does not have any wasted space along the sides, which will allow for greater packaging density.  Additionally, with active cooling, a prismatic cell allows the cell to have much less of a temperature gradient across it.  The center of a cylindrical cell can get much hotter as there is a lot of battery material around it relative to its size.  This isn't a huge deal for Tesla at the moment due to the small size of the 18650 cell, but if they go too much bigger and continue to drive the cells hard, this temperature gradient can have a significant impact on battery life.  Also, in general, a rectangle has a greater surface area to volume ratio for cooling.  There are certainly advantages to using prismatic cells over cylindrical ones.    However, go back to the early 2000's when Tesla was developing the roadster.  Nobody was building prismatic cells, and even if they were, they were not building in the volume that Tesla would require.  Cylindrical cells already existed, with the volume and economies of scale driven by the tech industry.  For Tesla, using the 18650 cell is a great move.  It is super cheap due to its already large production volume, and it has had a very large amount of R&D already paid for by the tech industry.  There really wasn't any other choice.  Now imagine approaching this decision as a large automaker such as Nissan, GM, VW, or BMW.  The volume is not there for the prismatic cell, but it doesn't matter.  Why?  Because if electric vehicles take off the volume will be so high that the production volume of cylindrical cells won't even compare to automotive prismatic cells.  But you have to start from the beginning and ramp up.  So all the major automakers are going with prismatic cells.  Because they can afford to pay a little extra now in order to grow the economies of scale and pay much less later.  And later is not 10+ years down the line.  Later is now or a couple years from now.  Look at your graph again.  The large drop in cost over the past few years is mostly due to economies of scale in ramping up prismatic cell production from zero.  Its almost at parity and its only going to get closer as volumes increase.  Since the large automakers had the money, they were able to use it to invest in the production of prismatic cells.  Again, Tesla's choice was not wrong.  They needed a cheap working technology ASAP.  The other automakers could afford to spend some capital and wait.  If electric vehicles succeed, the amount spent on growing battery volume to this level won't even matter.  Now lets tackle the chemistry differences.  Let me show you a different graph.  This shows the thermal runaway characteristics for different chemistries.  The Tesla roadster originally used that top line - LiCoO.  The Model S is using the NCA chemistry (second line).  The Volt and Leaf use LiMnO, the one at the bottom that barely even shows up on the graph.  (Lithium iron phosphate, the other one at the bottom of the graph, is almost an order of magnitude under LiMnO, but it has its own issues in implementation.)  The Tesla chemistry is more energy dense than the others, but it is also orders of magnitude more flammable.  This can be seen in real life by comparing the NHTSA Volt crash test fiasco with the Tesla's that burned after their batteries were pierced.  In both cases, the batteries went into thermal runaway, but the Volt packs took much longer to ignite than the Tesla ones.    Again, Tesla was not wrong to select the chemistry they did, but neither are GM, Nissan, and the others.  Tesla was able to fight the ""electric car = fire hazard"" media story much better than GM was (and the answer to why this is requires its own article).  Both companies weighed the risks when they selected the cells they did.  GM, Nissan, and others have still not seen a real world fire caused by their li-ion packs, and I think that is impressive in its own right.  Yes, this costs them a little in cost and range, but they are not startup companies running on small amounts of capital so they can afford to be more risk adverse.  Especially since they don't get the public sentiment that Tesla does.     Anyways, this got a lot longer than I originally anticipated, but I hope it helps shed some light on why different companies in different situations make different choices.  Cheers"
electricvehicles,39w87g,battery_engr,8,Mon Jun 15 11:40:26 2015 UTC,"Great post from the perspective of the major automakers. One phrase stands out in particular though:   if electric vehicles take off   These 5 words tell a great deal about why Tesla is succeeding where the majors are failing. Sure, everything you've said is technically accurate, and going for prismatic cells likely makes more sense long term, but what's lacking on the part of major automakers is motivation and commitment. While the majors ""wait and see"" whether EVs will take off, Tesla is taking off.  You speak of the majors' ability to invest large amounts of capital in prismatic cells now, notwithstanding the result being a higher-cost and lower-range product. While the technical argument for this strategy as you've outlined it makes sense, there's also a strong political argument for it that's been informed by the last ~20 years of history: The major automakers want EVs to fail, and if they produce high cost and undesirable EVs then it strengthens their case that there's no demand for them. Back in the 90s and early 00s representatives from GM and others made exactly this point in their successful appeal before regulators to weaken and delay California's ZEV mandate. And I have almost no doubt that were it not for Tesla, EVs would've suffered the same fate this time around. I'd love to hear your take on this as someone with the unique perspective of being an EV expert inside an ICE-dominated culture."
electricvehicles,39w87g,fooljoe,6,Mon Jun 15 20:12:11 2015 UTC,"Haha, I think you are reading a bit to far into that sentence.  I'm certainly passionate about what I do and so are many of my coworkers. I would also bet many of the people working on EVs at various other automakers and at Tesla are too.  If there was some conspiracy at the top to try to kill the electric car, I doubt they would straight tell us about it, but someone would probably figure it out.  I won't claim that our leadership is always making the best decisions regarding EVs, but I think we are moving in the right direction much faster than I initially anticipated.  From the cost perspective, we have only seen one generation of EVs from the major automakers so far.  Of course those first cars are going to be expensive and have interesting trade offs, that's how technology is developed.  Tesla is on its second generation with the Model S, the rest of us are just beginning to reach that point over the next couple years.  Costs are coming down, especially from an R&D and capital investment perspective.  The argument that we are building ""high cost and undesirable EVs"" will only get more difficult to make in the coming years.   Regardless of what these posts make me sound like, I am a Tesla fan.  I think they deserve a majority of the credit for kick starting the EV market as it stands today.  I hope they manage to stick around for a long time.  Competition is good for everyone, and it will help keep me employed :)"
electricvehicles,39w87g,battery_engr,2,Tue Jun 16 06:08:27 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong - I'm not arguing for some shady conspiracy; I'm only pointing out that it's natural for the major automakers - who make all their profits from a completely different type of car - to approach the EV market with trepidation. While they might not be out to ""kill the electric car"" (anymore at least), they certainly wouldn't be bothered too much if EVs just went away. Of course I'm using ""they"" here when different automakers have varying approaches to EVs, but you get the idea.  And I also don't at all mean to imply that you're not dedicated to what you do - I only question the decision-making of those at the top. And it's not even that I'm saying that decision-making is ""wrong"" - your CEO is charged with maximizing short-term profits, and that's what he must do. I'm merely pointing out the fact that Tesla is a company founded and run with the sole purpose of making EVs while the majors were founded and run with the sole purpose of making ICEVs, and just now are ""dabbling"" in EVs. This advantage on Tesla's behalf is seemingly insurmountable.   we have only seen one generation of EVs from the major automakers so far   To the contrary, nearly every major automaker has had significant experience with EVs and hybrids since long before Tesla came along. In the 90s we had the EV-1, Rav4-EV, Honda Plus, Nissan Altra, Ranger EV, and so on. The difference is the majors were all happy to pull the plug on their EV programs and pretend as if they never even existed, while Tesla went from nothing to a 300-mile EV that can drive cross country without inordinate charge time in less than 10 years."

electricvehicles,39w87g,lugezin,2,Tue Jun 16 23:12:07 2015 UTC,"Haha, if you don't think there's much profit to be made in electric vehicles then I strongly advise you to short TSLA. Its $32 billion market cap tells you that the market disagrees.  The reason they're not currently profitable is because they're sinking huge amounts of capital into the gigafactory. Once that's operational, they'll be immensely profitable, which is what the market cap has priced in.  As far as the majors, of course it's virtually impossible to make a profit when you plan to only produce 1400 or so cars, just to meet regulators' quotas."
electricvehicles,39w87g,fooljoe,2,Tue Jun 16 16:41:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If you look at Tesla's cashflow they are spending an absolutely staggering amount of money on capex and r&d. Superchargers, the gigafactory, etc are eating through a ton of money. They could stop growing and sell the model S as a profit, but obviously that would be a terrible long-term idea."
electricvehicles,39w87g,iSanddbox,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:14:06 2015 UTC,"Well said but I wonder when supercharger costs will go down. The more car they sell, the more peak congestion they'll have to deal with. On weekend trips in some states like CA, there is already long wait times. Imagine how bad it'll get with Model 3.  Anyway, I personally believe that supercharging network costs won't go down for 5 years or more. And that's actually a great ""moat"" in terms of competitiveness. I wouldn't buy a Model S equivalent (same features and price) from say Mercedes, only because of superchargers. It was a big factor (over 50%) in my decision to take the EV plunge."

I'm not really concerned. They're expanding the network aggressively, and the costs of the network itself will be amortized as more and more cars are sold. At the moment, though, it has a significant impact on their cash flow, since they're only selling one car. Once the model 3 starts being mass-produced I don't see how other automakers are going to catch up to Tesla's network."
electricvehicles,39w87g,iSanddbox,3,Wed Jun 17 17:45:19 2015 UTC,"Well, Tesla could have chosen to make any form factor they want in the Gigafactory when it opens. They are still saying they will choose to use cylindrical and they state benefits in both cooling and in quality control.  Volumetric energy density is not as big of a deal in purpose built BEVs as gravimetric density (specific energy). Certainly in PHEVs and conversion platforms or suboptimal multi-power source car platforms, volumetric energy density is a much higher concern. Therefore, the advantages of prismatic cells probably doesn't translate to real world benefits in a large capacity battery pack for purpose built BEVs with very high specific energy. Getting the right kinds of cooling, dealing with thermal runaway, and driving the absolute cheapest price for that level of performance are far more important for these kinds of vehicles."
electricvehicles,39w87g,tech01x,2,Mon Jun 15 16:49:04 2015 UTC,"Tesla could have chosen to make any form factor they want in the Gigafactory when it opens.   This is somewhat true.  But Tesla already has their entire battery strategy, models, software, etc. built around the 18650 cell.  It won't be worth it for them to switch away from that unless there is a clear advantage that outweighs the costs and risks of doing so.  While the case for prismatic cells is rapidly improving, I don't foresee it becoming so much better that Tesla will switch for many more years.    And you are also correct about the volumetric density.  This isn't a huge deal for Tesla (at least on the Model S, the Model 3 might benefit from a physically smaller pack), but it is a major concern for the major automakers that are concerned with packaging requirements."
electricvehicles,39w87g,battery_engr,3,Mon Jun 15 22:33:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not a battery engineer but I did some research into Tesla's batteries. Tesla wants to make a slightly larger cell in the Gigafactory, based on statements that they want to have a 10% wider and 10% taller cell, it seems they are aiming for the 20700 cylindrical form factor. You say that Prismatic is rapidly catching up with cylindrical. Tesla hasn't built that much of an empire around cylindrical cells as you describe yet (with the Gigafactory, they will), so it seems that Tesla is willingly choosing to stick with cylindrical. I'd like to know what they see that you don't or what you see that they don't.   As a side question, are you skeptical that Tesla can reduce battery pack costs by 30% per kWh in their Gigafactory?  EDIT: Also, interestingly enough, this source claims that prismatic cells can actually be LESS efficient in thermal management."
electricvehicles,39w87g,32no,3,Tue Jun 16 02:32:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert in Tesla's strategy, I just wanted to point out some reasons other companies are taking different routes.  I know a lot about what I'm doing, but my knowledge of what other automakers and Tesla are planning can certainly have some gaps.  I am personally skeptical of Tesla reducing costs by 30%, but I would really need to see data about where the extra cost is coming from in order to make a real prediction.  Tesla could certainly do it.  That source is interesting.  They don't provide any reasoning for that claim, but I'm thinking they mean that when stacked the gaps in the cylinders allow air to flow, allowing for some ambient cooling.    However, when liquid cooling, this doesn't mean much.  Regardless of the shape you are going to have to fit some kind of cooling fin in there anyways."
electricvehicles,39w87g,battery_engr,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:50:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering all these questions!  If Tesla claims to need the Gigafactory just to have the volume (and the economies of scale), do you see other manufactures soon following suit?  Or is everyone just going to outsource this?  And do you think they could compete with Tesla doing so?"

electricvehicles,39w87g,Scotty1992,3,Tue Jun 16 13:53:59 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. Choosing the prismatic form factor over cylindrical makes sense, but I still don't get why they would choose LiMnO over NCA. Tesla has had some fires, but their car still catches on fire about 1/5th as often as a gas car.  With a risk that small and a reward of doubling the car's range, why would GM and Nissan think that was the correct trade-off?"

This is true, but this argument seems to only work when its made by Tesla.  Leafs and Volts catch on fire 0/5th as often as gas cars, but that doesn't stop members of my own family from believing that Volts and Leafs are spontaneously bursting into flame all over the place.  I think GM and Nissan chose the right chemistry, even with its lower energy density.  Could you imagine if 5-10 Leafs and Volts had burned in traffic accidents?  I think that would have killed the EV business before it even started, at least for GM and Nissan.  I think you underestimate the additional risk for the major automakers here."
electricvehicles,39w87g,badcatdog,2,Mon Jun 15 22:45:01 2015 UTC,I've heard that most automakers are going to switch to NMC for their next generation of EVs. Have you heard anything that would support this?
electricvehicles,39w87g,Scotty1992,3,Tue Jun 16 06:43:43 2015 UTC,".. fundamentally better than the 18650 cylinders. Think about it, can you pack more circles into something or rectangles?   To be relevant, you need to include cooling and packaging. GM for example have two pouches and a cooling metal wafer in a metal box, and pack the boxes.   Additionally, with active cooling, a prismatic cell allows the cell to have much less of a temperature gradient across it.   They can be thick, giving serious cooling issues. Cooling large flat pouches in a lightweight even manner sounds difficult.   This isn't a huge deal for Tesla at the moment due to the small size of the 18650 cell, but if they go too much bigger   They estimate about 10-13% larger dimensions is optimum.   The volume is not there for the prismatic cell, but it doesn't matter. Why? Because if electric vehicles take off the volume will be so high..   They didn't produce large packs because they would cost too much etc. This is not ""doesn't matter"". If people don't want to buy small pack cars, then they are doomed to failure.  Tesla seems to be focused on power density and cost. I'm not sure what the other companies are focused on, easy pack assembly maybe?   Since the large automakers had the money, they were able to use it to invest in the production of prismatic cells.   Well, Renault-Nissan built pouch cell factories, and it looks like they will close them down and buy from LG Chem.  GM put some money in A123, and then sued them, and are buying from LG Chem."
electricvehicles,39w87g,badcatdog,2,Tue Jun 16 03:13:22 2015 UTC,"They can be thick, giving serious cooling issues. Cooling large flat pouches in a lightweight even manner sounds difficult.   I have participated in a 20 kW, 100% DOD test, on a ~7 kWh NMC pouch cell pack. Temperature rise was only ~15 degrees C above ambient. Things only started to get too warm if the pack was cycled multiple times in a single day without rest. Also this was with no cooling. So no, it's not something that is difficult - I've heard opposite from industry."
electricvehicles,39w87g,Scotty1992,2,Tue Jun 16 13:59:30 2015 UTC,"I've heard opposite from industry.   Your description is why Nissan does not even cool their packs, which has resulted in disturbing loss of capacity in hotter areas.  As I said, ""lightweight even manner"", which can involve a proportionally large amount of coolant or metal, which is not lightweight, such as with the Volt."
electricvehicles,39w87g,badcatdog,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:59:39 2015 UTC,"Your description is why Nissan does not even cool their packs, which has resulted in disturbing loss of capacity in hotter areas.   This is overly simplistic. My understanding is not only does Nissan not cool their packs, but the chemistry is sensitive to heat. They have since partially fixed this with the 'lizard' battery. (In my case, we didn't really care how long the batteries lasted. 2 years was enough.)  The point I am trying to make is that cooling pouch cells is not something that is difficult, they are not dissipating huge amounts of heat. Hotspots were not a problem, although cells in the middle of the pack certainly got hotter. I also find it extremely unlikely cooling pouch cells is harder than cooling thousands of 18650s, I can't picture it in my head. Why do you think this?"

I was particularly surprised by the specs of the cells used in the Honda Fit EV: From the specs you've presented those Toshiba SCiB cells look absolutely terrible, but a little more research shows that they're designed to have a much longer cycle life than typical lithium cells and are also capable of extremely fast charging rates (particularly interesting given that the Fit EV has no DC charging option.) Adding a few more columns to your table would make it a truly outstanding resource - namely cycle life, maximum recharge rate, and also cost (although I know I'm asking a lot.)

electricvehicles,39w87g,peterfirefly,2,Mon Jun 15 20:38:01 2015 UTC,"Great post with an even better follow-up discussion. Thanks!  On a broader scale, I think the key advantages (which seem to be sticking around indefinitely) are that: 1) Tesla is looking to disrupt the market rather than produce incremental improvements that lack features many consumers want (or think they want, which is essentially the same) from a car, 2) Tesla is itself looking at the battery issue from the ground up, rather than leaving that in large part to battery makers who are not car companies - a disconnect that leaves a lot to be desired (notably, Nissan tried to tackle the battery issue itself, but obviously didn't do a great job of it), 3) Tesla is also doing this with regard to the charging and charging network, software, and other matters... because Tesla actually wants the EV revolution to happen as quickly as possible, while few executives at the top of auto companies want to even think about what is going to happen to their companies as that transition occurs - they know their sunk costs and competitive advantages, and they are ~99% in ICE vehicles."
electricvehicles,39w87g,toomuchtodotoday,3,Fri Jun 19 16:39:22 2015 UTC,"Some good points here.  Eberhard pointed out that all cells can catch fire, so precautions have to be made anyhow.  Cell manufacturers don't know how to make safe packs either, and advise car makers not to use the laptop cells.  The whole business just sounds too dangerous and complicated to other car makers.  Now that LG Chem have promised cells which are cheap enough and dense enough, the other car makers must feel justified in their decision.  Their failure to follow Tesla's lead will only prolong their lack of competitiveness."

electricvehicles,39w87g,NastyCabbage,3,Mon Jun 15 09:59:03 2015 UTC,"Some of them are waking up:  http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-656186-1-1769164-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-614232-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html  http://www.mdr.de/sachsen/litec-kamenz102_zc-f1f179a7_zs-9f2fcd56.htm  Daimler owns both Li-Tec Battery GmbH in Sachsen and ACCUmotive in Baden-Württemberg.  Li-Tec does R&D and seems to be very good at making separators.  Li-Tec also used to have a small Li-Ion cell production.  ACCUmotive builds batteries at a much larger scale.  First news gets out that Li-Tec is shutting down production (or maybe it has already happened) but nobody is going to be fired and the R&D is going to continue.  Then news gets out that ACCUmotive is building a new factory in the same little 15,000-people town in Sachsen where Li-Tec is -- and they are going to build Li-Ion cells big time.  Those poor people in Baden-Württemberg... it's going to be such a long commute ;)  They are also getting into the energy storage business: http://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/autoindustrie/nach-tesla-bringt-auch-daimler-hausbatterien-auf-den-markt-a-1035951.html  Note that this is spearheaded by a certain Harald Kröger, who used to be on Tesla's board.  Maybe Daimler sold their Tesla shares because they wanted to get a piece of the business themselves?  Or maybe Tesla practically forced Kröger off the board because they knew what he was up to at Daimler?    BMW -- or at least a company owned by the same family as BMW, namely the Quandts -- is also getting into the game through the company Solarwatt in Dresden which Stefan Quandt bought cheap a couple of years ago.  They recently introduced a home battery product that complements their solar panels (and works with competitors' as well) through the same DC-DC converter trick that Tesla uses.  Tesla's modules seem to be a lot cheaper, though.  More links:  http://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/autoindustrie/stefan-quandt-macht-elon-musk-mit-batterie-konkurrenz-a-1032810.html#ref=plista http://www.solarwatt.de/index.php?id=4&L=0 http://www.solarwatt.de/speicher/  It seems to be a Li-Ion product (because it is light-weight and maintenance-free).

electricvehicles,39w87g,Vik1ng,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:56:55 2015 UTC,"Tesla Model S uses a gigantic battery pack. It is between 2.5 times to 3.5 times the size of the Nissan Leaf pack and 3.75 to 5.3 times the size of the Chevrolet Volt battery pack. Clearly and obviously then, the power to energy requirements of the Leaf and Volt are greater and the vehicles must be able to deliver consistent performance across entire SOC range. (Tesla performance is known to vary with SOC - this is not acceptable when a car that does 0-60 in 9 sec already. Tesla Model S cells are therefore completely inappropriate to use in a ~20 kWh EV, as the battery size decreases the power to energy requirement increases and therefore the energy density of the cells must decrease.  Short range EVs have used 18650s before. Tesla builds the powertrain for the Mercedes Benz B-class. While it is not a ground-up EV, the powertrain does not seem to offer massive benefits or improved performance over for example, the Nissan Leaf.   All three vehicles use lithium-ion batteries. The Leaf and the Volt use cells with a lithium manganese oxide cathode (LMO), while the Tesla uses cells with a lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide cathode (NCA).   Tesla is NCA, Nissan Leaf is LMO with LNO (according to AESC), Chevy Volt is NMC (NOT LMO). LG Chem seems be be producing higher Ni-rich NMC cells now, so LG Chem cells are becoming closer to those used in Tesla.    This cost advantage will shrink in the future, but it is still fairly significant[4]     Graph only goes to 2013, in 2015 the gap would be fairly small, and it is getting smaller in the future. Also note that Nickel and Cobalt are much more expensive than Manganese and the Leaf doesn't have a cooling system. Of course, Nissan Leaf cells are known to have poor longevity possibly due to lack of thermal management and sensitive chemistry - but I am not convinced on a per kWh basis Tesla is much cheaper than AESC, if at all. LG Chem is rumored to be operating its facilities at 30%, there CEO is confident they can improve costs.  http://chargedevs.com/features/lg-chem-power-ceo-were-the-li-ion-leader-for-pevs-because-of-material-science/   I think there is a fundamental flaw in the way that GM, Nissan, Daimler, and all the other major auto companies approach safety. Nissan and Chevy approach battery safety like this: let's use the safest cells in the hope that they will be less likely to catch on fire.   I think you don't know anything about the way GM, Nissan, or Daimler design there batteries.  End result is pouch cells are becoming closer to 18650s in cost, possibly offer superior thermal dissipation, and chemistry is seemingly converging at a place closer to Tesla. That's even though the energy density might be somewhat lower. Part of lower energy density is due to different performance requirements of Chevy Volt and Nissan Leaf. Therefore your statement that ""I think Tesla's lead in the EV space is only going to grow."" cannot be correct.  I think Tesla will likely deliver an innovative product that will be different from its competitors. I think it will be a product that more people want to buy and it will play to the strong points of battery / EV technology (as the Model S does). I don't think the powertrain will be much more technologically advanced than competitors, if at all."
electricvehicles,39w87g,_Madison_,2,Tue Jun 16 13:43:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry it took me so long to get back to you. I was visiting family for the day.  I'm not sure if you're talking about size of the batteries in terms of energy or in terms of weight. In terms of weight, the Model S battery is less than twice as heavy as the Leaf's, but in terms of energy, it's about 3.5 times bigger. And I would have to disagree with you that the Leaf needs to use a different chemistry than the Model S because of the size of the battery.  While it's true that the Leaf's battery is a lower percentage of its weight compared to the Model S (18.9% for the Leaf vs 25.8% for the Model S), you have to take into consideration the fact that the Leaf's battery would have almost double the energy if it was using NCA cells instead of LMO. So even though the rate of NCA cells is lower, it would be mostly compensated for by the increase in energy.  From what I recall, owners of the Model S said that the 0 - 60 times at 10% charge were 25% slower than the times at full charge. If that is the case then I don't think it would be significant enough to be a problem if the Leaf used the same cells.   My mistake on the Volt. I could have sworn that at least the first generation of Volt used NMO. Maybe I'm wrong.  Could you link me the AESC page with the information about the Leaf and the Volt's batteries?  It's true that I don't KNOW exactly how GM, Nissan, or Daimler approach battery safety. I am speculating based on their pack design and public comments which have been made by CEOs of the companies and people who work for the battery companies that supply them. Pretty much everyone in the battery industry or the electric car industry who I've heard talk about batteries, from Andrew Farrah, to Prabhakar Patil, to Ann Marie Sastry, to recycling experts, talk about safety in the same way. They all talk about developing safer cells. None of them even MENTION the pack element. That trend, combined with the lack of fire supressants within the pack, combined with the fact that everyone except Tesla chose chemistries with lower chance of thermal runaway at the cost of energy density combine to make me think that they are approaching battery safety the wrong way.  I do wonder why Tesla has chosen to stick with the cylindrical format for the Gigafactory. It seems to me like now that they have the scale to justify producing cells specifically for EVs, they would switch to a more suitable format.  Perhaps they just don't have access to suppliers that can produce high enough energy density prismatic cells for it to be worth their time to switch. Who knows.  But if past willingness to innovate is any indication, Tesla is going to be ahead of the curve in battery technology."
electricvehicles,39w87g,tech01x,2,Wed Jun 17 07:51:19 2015 UTC,"One thing I attempt to do, is attempt to deduce reasons or possible reasons that EV manufacturers chose the batteries the batteries they did. The reasons you suggested do not sound reasonable to me, there must be more considerations.   Could you link me the AESC page with the information about the Leaf and the Volt's batteries?   http://www.eco-aesc-lb.com/en/product/liion_ev/  Nissan Leaf cells are 157 Wh/kg, Tesla cells are around 230 Wh/kg. So that's 47% increase in energy density by mass.  Tesla cells are closer to ~620 Wh/L whereas Leaf are 317 Wh/L. So that's about double energy density in terms of volume. However, obviously each pack needs a different design in order to support the cells. Tesla has an individual fuse wire for every cell, thermal material, and liquid cooling channels. It is a work of art honestly. Nissan however simply puts 4 cells in basically a sardine can, then adds lots of modules (much simpler). GM uses pouch cells with flat liquid cooled plates between every couple of cells.  Model S also has a much bigger battery than either, I assume there's some economies of scale.  Nissan Leaf was also released in 2010, whereas the Model S was released in 2012. My understanding is Panasonic came out with its NCA cells in late 2009, which was around the time pre-production Leafs and Volts were already driving. LMO also contains less Cobalt and Nickel than NCA, perhaps GM / Nissan thought this would lower cost.  So while the difference in energy density is large I don't think it's perhaps as large as you are suggesting (almost 2x) and the Chevy Volt and Nissan Leaf came before the Model S too.  Also note that the powertrain of Mercedes B-class Electric Drive is made by Tesla. While the car is a compliance car rather than a purpose built EV, it doesn't seem to offer massively better performance than other similar cars like Ford Focus EV. Obviously it's not a very good example, since it's not a purpose built EV.   From what I recall, owners of the Model S said that the 0 - 60 times at 10% charge were 25% slower than the times at full charge.   Nissan Leaf is a 1500 kg car, Tesla Model S is a 2100 kg car. Nissan Leaf has a 24 kWh car, Model S is a 60, 70, or 85 kWh car. The Nissan Leaf battery will therefore use 1.8 to 2.5 times the energy per unit of overall battery capacity to get the car to 60 mph (ignoring wind and rolling resistance) compared to the Model S. So the impact could be much greater than you anticipate.   double the energy if it was using NCA cells instead of LMO   It's also not just NCA versus LMO - batteries can be optimized for power or energy, pouch cells also tend to have lower energy density than cylindrical cells. Panasonic have higher capacity NCA cells than what Tesla uses, but they have worse discharge characteristics.   It's true that I don't KNOW exactly how GM, Nissan, or Daimler approach battery safety.  Andrew Farrah, to Prabhakar Patil, to Ann Marie Sastry, to recycling experts, talk about safety in the same way.   Good point, but keep in mind that Prabhakar is CEO of a chemical company, Ann Marie Sastry is working on new chemistry. I'm convinced there is technical documentation somewhere on the web on why Nissan / GM went with the pack design they did, I just can't seem to find it.  Regarding chemistry: http://insideevs.com/external-form-factor-2016-chevy-volt-battery-unchanged-compared-current-volt/  Interesting article on the GM batteries: http://www.autoblog.com/2013/09/16/gm-expands-warren-battery-lab-to-better-test-elr-next-gen-volt/#image-4  In a Volt, the demands on cycle-life are much greater than Tesla because the range is so small. The usable SOC is also much lower than the Leaf so discharge power AND regen power are always high enough, and also so that range does not reduce as the battery ages. (Obviously Nissan failed at battery longevity which is rather poor honestly).  FYI the highest energy density NMC pouch cells that I have seen are these:  http://www.cdiweb.com/datasheets/ctc-battery/FEI-DataSheet-IMP06160230P25A-Pouch-25Ah-v5.pdf  http://media.zeromotorcycles.com/press-2015/press-kits/2015-zero-press-kit-us-e.pdf#page=13  A 27 Ah variant now exists, but I can't find the datasheet, but it's probable 440 Wh/L and 195 Wh/kg. They are used by Zero Motorcycles who can cram 15 kWh of them onto a Motorcycle, which is extremely impressive. Also note that Tesla 7 kWh power-wall is also NMC, which is interesting because the 10 kWh version is NCA. Tesla also hired Jeff Dahn who I believe was one of the inventors of NMC (although he works on other battery related things). Point is, like NCA, NMC seems like a very good chemistry.  Sorry, I think this post is more a collection of thoughts over a concise argument. I agree with you about pack design and Tesla being the leader.  The factors you suggest seem real, however I don't think they are not the only factors at play. I also don't think the lead Tesla has is as large as you are suggesting. In the future, there is absolutely nothing stopping LG Chem or perhaps AESC from coming out with a cell somewhat better than the 27 Ah Farasis, with Nissan & GM putting >40 kWh into a long range EV to compete with Model 3, which is seemingly exactly what they intend to do. I also think this will be a much better comparison between the approach traditional automakers take versus Tesla, since the size of the battery should be closer and the time-frame should also be similar. I think Tesla will edge out in terms of energy density and capacity somewhat (but not massively), will have superchargers, and will end up with a sexier and more unconventional product."
electricvehicles,39w87g,badcatdog,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:50:47 2015 UTC,"Great links to the articles about GM's battery facility and the NMC batteries. Haven't seen those before.  But so far as I can tell, that link to the AESC page only goes over the Leaf's battery, not the Volt battery. Here's a source that says the Volt's battery is LMO (scroll down to the 10th page). Then again, this report might be mistaken because it also says that the Model S is using LMO which is definitely wrong.  I wish I knew more about the batteries inside other EVs like the i3, the Fiat 500, and the others so that I could make a more general comparison. But from what I understand, these higher energy density chemistries that other automakers will have to use in order to make long range EVs will be more prone to thermal runaway (at least they will until automakers switch over to solid state chemistries. So they will probably NEED to adopt a pack design more like Tesla's. I suppose we will have to wait and see.  Oh, and one last thing: Tesla might not be using NCA for the 10 kWh ""home backup"" battery. I say this because in [this video] of the shareholder's meeting, Elon said that they have increased the 10 kWh Powerwall's continuous power to 5 kW and it's peak power to 7 kW. The previous announcement said 2 kW continous and 3.3 kW max. I don't think they could have improved the power delivery that much without switching chemistries."

LG Chem seems to usually be NMC or LMO/NMC. Not entirely sure about this, but I think there's a lot of research into more aggressive NMC blends which end up being Nickel rich. One thing I noticed from looking at datasheets, is as energy density goes (and power density goes down) up with NMC, the nominal cell voltage decreases slightly from 3.7 V to 3.6 V."

This little city car isn't really designed for long highway drives like that, but it did the journey effortlessly.   The charging infrastructure in Slovakia is growing slowly, but still it's growing faster than the tiny number of EVs on the roads. At the last count there are only around 60 EVs on the country's roads as they're expensive and exotic, given the lower wages here.

electricvehicles,39tbm2,aghstnashell,2,Sun Jun 14 16:20:10 2015 UTC,"All Leafs have battery heaters.  They improved the heaters efficiency for the 2013+ models.  It will still decrease in range in cold weather, but the battery is thermally managed.  EDIT:  The battery is technically thermally managed (heater and passive air cooling), but it does not have a thermal management system designed to optimize range in all temperature conditions."
electricvehicles,39tbm2,DriedT,2,Sun Jun 14 21:05:09 2015 UTC,"The battery heater is just a resistive heating element to protect the battery from a no-start condition.  It only activates during subzero temperatures, so you won't really benefit from it, range wise.  When people say thermally managed, they usually refer to an active cooling/heating system, at least in this context."
electricvehicles,39tbm2,kemingerror,2,Sun Jun 14 23:23:37 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see.  The owner manual says it turns on at -4°F and off once it reaches 14°F.  Certainly more of a protection system rather than a management system that would lead to more consistent range at all temperatures.  I'm looking into buying a Leaf, but since I'm in a temperate climate region I never looked very in depth at the battery heater and was unfamiliar with the terminology."

You notice how I didn't even mention L1?  Screw L1.  Upgrade your factory L1 to L2 at EVSEupgrade.com or burn it so no other EV users have to deal with it.

I had one for two years, and it was a perfectly good car. Round trip to work was 40 miles, and I used something like a total of 50 gallons of gas over two years.   For pure electric, I prefer the Chevy Spark. Way more zip than the Leaf, and the same range. I regularly pull away from sports cars at lights in my new Spark EV. Make you get the one with fast charge option if you go that route.   Note that electric range drops quite dramatically in cold weather, or when running the AC."

You may have to wear a coat instead of use much heat though if you think your destination is 50-60 miles away and you're gettin on the highway in the cold. Haven't tried it in snow either, but its denser than a normal car it's size because of the battery.  I've never tried the leaf though so I can't compare that.

It is much more efficient than the regular resistive heater. You should also keep an eye out for one with a 6.6kw charger for public L2 charging at double the speed of the older 3.3kw.  it won't speed up the turbocord, which is only capable of 3.3kw, but it will be very nice for charging when you are out and about."

But how would the battery age?  Is it really that bad?  Would winter strand me somewhere?"
electricvehicles,39r85r,paulwesterberg,3,Sun Jun 14 00:17:57 2015 UTC,"Don't let people talk you out of the used leafs. There really are good deals to be had.  The battery aging issues are really only affecting places like AZ where the temps are regularly over 100 F for weeks at a time. You can use CarFax to see where the car was registered. The off-lease cars are regularly traded nationally between dealers at auction, so you never really know where it is from unless you check.   It sounds like turbocord will be fine for you at home, but still consider finding a leaf with 6.6kw charger for when you use public charging.   I don't know how cold Ohio gets, but I have read some horror stories for trying to use the leaf at -20F. Things like range down to 35 miles, etc.   One more thing -- get a cheap Bluetooth ODB II reader from Amazon and get the Android LeafSpy app. It will let you check the real battery aging instead of the ""12 bars"" on the dash. If you don't have an Android phone, you can get a Samsung Galaxy Duos for about $75 new on Amazon (or find a friend)."
electricvehicles,39r85r,buddhra,2,Sun Jun 14 14:33:41 2015 UTC,"But how would the battery age?   Nissan has a diagnostic test for battery life/health and should offer that report if you buy a certified used Leaf. I live in Wisconsin and I didn't have any problems driving the Leaf in the winter, but my driving was mostly urban/suburban. If you push the Leaf going 70+ on the interstate then rated miles fall off quickly."
electricvehicles,39r85r,fuckbread,5,Mon Jun 15 22:47:24 2015 UTC,"I have a 2012 Volt that's rated for 35 miles in electric. During the summer I'll get 38-42 miles. During the winter I've gotten as low as 28, but usually low 30's. Preheating the car while it's still plugged in helps, but the electric heater still really eats up the range.  I chose a Volt because I want one vehicle, the electric range is enough for my normal commute, and at least once a month I need to drive 200+ miles in a day and I can do it with zero compromise in a Volt.   A Leaf simply can't be my only vehicle.  The only car I'd give it up for is a Tesla, but I recognize that Supercharging, while free and  awesome, is still going to add time to a long trip and not everyone is willing to make that compromise."
electricvehicles,39r85r,fuckbread,3,Sun Jun 14 03:37:08 2015 UTC,"My two cents (trying not to repeat other comments): I drove a 2003 Echo for a while--loved it. Upgraded to 2010 Prius. Loved that. Sold it in 2013 and leased a Leaf SV (all options other than leather and wheels on SL). Going on year three of lease and I've been sold since day 1. The transition is a lot of fun if you like to geek out on EV stuff like planning routes, finding free charging, mods, EV culture, etc. My commute is 50 miles per day and I live in the Bay Area.   I would not purchase a used electric car at this point--volt or leaf. They are ""cheap"", but there are always really good leasing incentives that make purchasing a 2 year old car not really worth it. I pay 160 a month after tax for an almost fully-optioned leaf and have spent $75 on maintenance over 2 years/20k miles. Since it's a lease, I don't give a crap about battery degradation (though I've seen none despite frequent quick charging and charging to 100%) Others have pointed out that used leafs are cheap because the tax incentives are already used up, which is something to consider if you want.   In regards to a turbocord--yes, a cool and relatively inexpensive EVSE, but I would not recommend anything below 6.6kw--especially if you are paying your landlord to install an outlet. 240v at 16amps max is not much better than the stock cord...especially if you are charging over night (since you'll have to). If you get in a routine of plugging in and setting the timer, you're not going to reap any real benefits of charging ""up to 3 times faster"" (because it's still slow as shit). I would get the stock EVSE upgraded with these guys for $287 and have a 240v 30amp outlet installed. You can better take advantage of low rates in off-peak hours since you'll only need to charge for a few hours per night, plus if you are in a bind and only have an hour or so to charge for a longer trip, you'll be able to add 2x as many miles as the turbocord setup. I paid a local electrician (in California) $250 total to install an outlet on the side of my house. If you lease, you can find someone on the mynissanleaf forums to swap chargers with when you need to return your car.   I personally love the Volt, but it just came down to not wanting to deal with a combustion engine. We have an older civic we beat to hell on road trips, so the extra mileage wasn't worth it for us.   Good luck in your search!   (Edit: meant lease not leaf)"
electricvehicles,39r85r,fuckbread,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:03:13 2015 UTC,"Would I qualify on the new lease offers on the volt, spark, and leaf?  I have no credit, but plan on a 8-9k downpayment.  If it's only $160 a month, I'll get a new anything.  EDIT: The spark offer isn't available in Ohio, apparently, and the leaf offer ends before I am willing to buy this car."
electricvehicles,39r85r,Zen_Drifter,2,Sun Jun 14 02:15:07 2015 UTC,"This is hard to say. I put $2500 towards drive off costs and have good credit/income. Your individual situation will depend on a lot of different factors. You might be able to negotiate paying the entire lease cost up front if they don't want to lease to you due to credit. The money factor (interest you pay over lease term) is generally laughable compared to interest on actual loans. Read up on leasing strategies before you get into a car buying/leasing situation.   When shopping for a lease, it's crucial to look at the total cost of lease (after rebates, if any) versus the monthly payment. I see leaf lease offers all the time for ""no money down and only 199 a month!"" which sounds great. What that really means is that after you pay drive off costs (tax/license/fees) and taxes, it's not that good of a deal. When shopping for quotes, I would use email only and create a spreadsheet. Send the same message to all of your local dealers. Make sure you ask for total drive off costs (including everything!). Weed out the ridiculously high offers and start negotiating from there. Like anything that has to do with a new car--don't pay what they are asking. If they say the national promotion is the best they can do, politely tell them to fuck off.   It looks like Ohio does not have any state incentives like California, which is a huge bummer.   My main piece of advice that perhaps trumps all other nuances of your situation (like whether or not you should get an EV, charging questions, leasing vs. buying, etc) is DO YOUR HOMEWORK! Do not get excited and walk into a dealership. You WILL get taken to the cleaners, regardless of what ""awesome deal"" you think you got. Car salespeople are trained to make you feel good and like you are ripping them off--this is never the case. Even if you think car salespeople are ""nice and friendly"" and they make you feel ""special""--you are wrong. You are a paycheck to them. Regardless of how much integrity any car salesperson has, they are not working to make you happy or do you any favors (these are secondary benefits they might get)--they are working for a shitty commission from their dealer selling high-ticket items. You'll hear a lot of people on the web talking about how car salespeople are ""regular folks just trying to work hard and get a paycheck"". This might be true in a sense, but you as a customer are a blip on their radar of making a quota. My advice is to stay as far away from every car dealer until you are completely ready to sign paperwork. Get everything in writing over email, shop around, get official quotes to show other dealers. If you need to test drive, go to a dealer during a slow time and tell them you just started shopping and you are only looking for a quick test drive. Be polite, but make it clear you are in no way interested in sitting down to talk numbers. /endrant"

This is more true if you're in one of the more hilly cities I guess."

Also the warranties were transferable back when the Leaf first launched:   This warranty is generally transferable from the original ‘owner other than a Nissan dealer’ (OWNER) to subsequent owners of the vehicle at any time ownership of the vehicle is transferred, without any action on your part; except that this warranty is not transferable but is instead void if during the first six months after delivery to the original OWNER: (1) ownership of the vehicle is transferred from the original OWNER, and (2) the vehicle is registered outside of the United States   I assume this is still the case."

electricvehicles,39nsop,Vailhem,6,Sat Jun 13 02:06:38 2015 UTC,"Thought I'd give my two cents since this is one of the topics I research. I have a background in environmental economics, and recently we have been looking at alternative ways to fund transportation infrastructure. There are a few issues with the current model. The federal gas and diesel taxes have not changes since 1993 and have decreased in real terms quite substantially. Also, revenues are declining as cars are becoming more fuel efficient- and driving decreased substantially during the recession and their are doubts about vehicle miles travelled going forward.  To make up for the loss of revenues and the continued need for highway improvements, Congress has approved roughly 65 billion dollars in transfers from general revenues in recent years. There are three major issues, the first two perhaps being more obvious. First, that money could be spent elsewhere (potentially with higher net benefits to society). Second, it has been done through very short term extensions to highway funding that make it difficult for highway programs to properly plan ahead for project budgets.  Finally, there are issues with the incentives created -- or not created-- by gasoline taxes and general fund transfers. GF transfers obviously do nothing to make consumers drive less. When you account for the externalities of driving (CO2, local air pollution, road damage, congestion, accidents, etc), the cost per mile of driving to society is way higher than what we pay in gasoline taxes. This means we are driving too much (and at the wrong times). Gasoline taxes to a certain extent encourage less driving, but this incentive is weak for fuel-efficient cars and non-existant for electric vehicles. I love EVs, but they pay essentially nothing for our roadways.  CO2 is really the only externality that is directly tied to gasoline consumption, making a carbon/ gas tax an efficient instrument (but CO2 emissions alone should priced at $40 per gallon. The other major externalities like road damage and congestion are linked to miles driven, which is where a mileage fee comes into play. By pricing the miles one drives, you are encouraging more efficient use of the transportation system. If you can change the pricing based on peak times/areas, you are in great shape... And you are raising desperately needed money.  Happy to answer any questions related to the economics of transportation, including EVs."
electricvehicles,39hei4,Dakujem,10,Thu Jun 11 18:58:21 2015 UTC,"I'd been saving for quite a while now and that + a pure miracle meant I bought my first EV since this one.   It's been 7 years since I've owned an EV and not a day has gone by where I didn't think about owning one again.   That day finally came today. I bought the car in the title picture for €7000 this morning - the bargain of the century here in Europe - and I am now the proud owner.  Those of you who already own EVs know what I'm talking about, but for the last 10 hours I've been wearing a massive EV Grin!  Edit: I should add that the number plate in the picture is just a decorative one I bought for €16 for cool photo opportunities. There's no way I could afford the genuine personalised plates; they're around €500!"

electricvehicles,39hei4,wouazo,8,Thu Jun 11 19:19:09 2015 UTC,"I know! It's a real Christmas miracle - and it's not even Christmas. The story is a little bit sad actually. This particular Peugeot iOn was the first privately purchased electric car in Slovakia (the only ones before this were bought by large firms). The car is 4 years old and still under warranty.  The man originally bought the car for his wife in late 2011. She drove it regularly, and put 37,000 km on the clock. Sadly however, last September she passed away after battling cancer. The widower held onto the car until now but has now decided to let it go.  He offered to sell it to car dealers who'd offer him €7000 over the phone (a bargain) but when he got to the dealers they'd walk around the car, pointing out flaws and telling him ""it's not worth it"", before offering him 5k. He told them to stick it. :-)  He advertised the car and the original ad is still online here for €10,000 but people are wary of EVs here. They're new and... well, weird.   Then, when I went to say hello with my wife he greeted me and introduced himself. Turns out that he know about my EV-obsessed past. We got on really well, he's a nice dude, we chatted for ages and he offered it to me for €7k.   I was gobsmacked and we talked about why he'd do such a thing. It's a combination of not needing the car, being at the stage of life where money isn't the be-all and end-all, and also (I assume) closing a chapter in his life. I accepted his offer, and now I own the car!  I really feel very, very lucky. I'm meeting with the previous owner again on Monday to grab a couple of extra bits for the car, and I'll be sure to bring (at the very least) a nice bottle of New Zealand wine... if I can find one!  There's an article here from a Slovak car website (though it's in Slovak) about the previous owner buying the car for his late wife, and it being the first privately owned EV in Slovakia: http://www.onaaauto.sk/auto-bild-prvou-sukromnou-vlastnickou-elektromobilu-je-alzbeta/562/clanek.html"

But you get 3 warnings, plus the SoC display includes a buffer.  Example, when it shows 15%, the battery is really not that low.  You can check this with the various LEAF battery monitoring tools out there.  Once you have driven the LEAF for a while, you'll understand just how bad that guess-o-meter display is, and what the car can/can't do, and how driving/weather conditions can affect battery performance.  Ironically, the only time I've been stranded due to a dead battery was when my 12V battery died (traction pack was still around 60%).  The lowest I've gone is around 12 GIDs, but that was when I first got the vehicle, and wanted to push the vehicle limits for educational purposes.  TL;DR the only people who get stranded because of a dead traction pack, are the same people that would run out of gas."

I've been driving mine daily for nearly 4 years now, and I've never even turtled it.   The flip side of this is that there have been a couple of trips over the years that I decided not to take, because my intuition said I might not make it.

The right way to approach the problem is by dealing with safety at the pack level. If your cells are small enough, and your cooling systems are good enough, and you use some extra tricks like coating the inside of the pack with flame retardant, you can prevent a fire in one cell from spreading to the others inside the pack.

electricvehicles,39aj4r,buddhra,3,Wed Jun 10 12:55:10 2015 UTC,"It probably won't happen.  Most EVs are not designed with a battery that can be swapped.  You can do that with a $100k car but not with a $30 to $40k car.    The battery is going to live a very long time unless you live in a very hot climate and have an EV with no cooling system or drive a zillion miles year (say > 25k).    The bigger challenge is getting automakers to come out with low cost BEVs that will meet most customer's range requirements in a cold winter and after 8 years of use.  Let's say a typical driver needs 50 miles of range... actually let's add 20% for errands and make it 60 miles of range per day.  And they want at least that same range in a cold winter after 8 years of use,  then, assuming 30% capacity loss and 30% range loss in a cold winter, an EV would need an initial range of 60/(1-.30)/(1-.30) =  122 miles.  The 2016 LEAF will almost have that range and the 2017 Chevy Bolt (and possibly 2017 LEAF) will have significantly more than that.  I think that the most cost effective solution would be BEVs with 125 to 150 miles range."
electricvehicles,39aj4r,motley2,3,Wed Jun 10 13:55:17 2015 UTC,"One significant potential problem with this being the storage space needed to place rental batteries in.  As more and more people buy electric cars the more rental batteries you would need. Unless they manage to massively reduce the size of the car battery, while providing the same amount of power and range, you'd wind up with a logistical nightmare. Just think of all the rental batteries that would have to be stored in cities like New York or London."
electricvehicles,39aj4r,privatly,2,Wed Jun 10 14:27:50 2015 UTC,I think a lot of that would be handled by software to optimize which locations need which battery sizes. You could also possibly request and reserve batteries and see what sizes are available before you go to the station.
electricvehicles,39aj4r,mikedufty,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:17:28 2015 UTC,"Would that really be such a problem?  Most of them would be stored in the cars that are using them most of the time.  Swapped batteries would be charged and ready to go out again before long. I think there are plenty of worse difficulties with the scheme.  From my point of view I just like owning stuff, wouldn't like to rent a battery.  But I read that a lot of EVs in the US are leased, so I may be in a minority globally."
electricvehicles,39aj4r,EvisGamer,3,Wed Jun 10 15:08:34 2015 UTC,"As interesting as this conversation is, I can't help but think it's purely academic.  There are plenty of analysts at EV manufacturers who have crunched these numbers to a degree not possible by Reddit enthusiasts.  You simply have no chance to develop a model outside of a MAJOR manufacturing consortium.  It may come in time, but I suspect it will depend on battery tech first.  They simply need to be fully optimized and so standard between manufacturers that there's no competitive advantage to be had.  Until that time, no company that has spent millions on battery development is going to be keen on the idea of letting their batteries float around in an uncontrolled market."

electricvehicles,39aj4r,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:54:04 2015 UTC,"Better Place:       Better Place was a venture-backed international company that developed and sold battery-charging and battery-switching services for electric cars. It was formally based in Palo Alto, California, but the bulk of its planning and operations were steered from Israel, where both its founder Shai Agassi and its chief investors resided.  The company opened its first functional charging station the first week of December 2008 at Cinema City in Pi-Glilot near Tel Aviv, Israel  The first customer deliveries of Renault Fluence Z.E. electric cars enabled with battery switching technology began in Israel in the second quarter of 2012,  and at peak in mid September 2012, there were 21 operational battery-swap stations open to the public in Israel.   Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. The company's financial difficulties were caused by mismanagement, wasteful efforts to establish toeholds and run pilots in too many countries, the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, and a market penetration far lower than originally predicted by Shai Agassi. Less than 1,000 Fluence Z.E. cars were deployed in Israel and around 400 units in Denmark, after spending about US$850 million in private capital.

electricvehicles,39aj4r,SpudB0y,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:19:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's what most people don't appreciate about Better Place. The innovation wasn't in the swapping, it was in the business model.   Agassi dealt with the battery issue by simply swatting it away. Previous approaches relied on a traditional manufacturing formula: We make the cars, you buy them. Agassi reimagined the entire automotive ecosystem by proposing a new concept he called the Electric Recharge Grid Operator. It was an unorthodox mashup of the automotive and mobile phone industries. Instead of gas stations on every corner, the ERGO would blanket a country with a network of ""smart"" charge spots. Drivers could plug in anywhere, anytime, and would subscribe to a specific plan—unlimited miles, a maximum number of miles each month, or pay as you go—all for less than the equivalent cost for gas. They'd buy their car from the operator, who would offer steep discounts, perhaps even give the cars away. The profit would come from selling electricity—the minutes. source"

electricvehicles,396fec,ImTheDerek,3,Tue Jun 9 16:19:37 2015 UTC,"I'm a member of the Dallas Makerspace in Carrollton, Texas and we have had our EVSE's on PlugShare for over a year. They are mostly used by members, but we occasionally get a traveler coming thru.   http://api.plugshare.com/view/location/51745  Our J1772 EVSE was donated to DMS by NRG eVgo via NTEAA.org. The Tesla HPWC (Model S) was donated by Tesla as part of their ""Destination Charging"" program, so our hardware cost was minimal.  The Dallas Makerspace is paying a commercial rate of US$0.087/KWh for electricity as of summer 2014. To get the cost per hour, multiply the cost per KWh (US$0.087) by the Kilowatts drawn by the car (208v x Amps). Many EVs, like most 2011/2012 Nissan Leafs, pull only 15A when charging and will cost less than US$0.30 per hour to charge. The Tesla EVSE is on a dedicated 100A circuit and is set to the 80A charge rate, but it only gives that higher rate to the few Tesla cars that are equipped with dual chargers.

electricvehicles,396fec,snommisnats,2,Tue Jun 9 16:56:44 2015 UTC,"I most likely will add to the description no PHEVs, since I'm not near any destinations and it seems a little silky to have my driveway taken up for two hours for someone to lose half their charge getting to/from the freeway. So anyone charging will be 6.2kWh for now. I've been trying to figure out if a 14-50 is compatible with my table saw before putting in one of those in.  Off peak usage is not really an issue (9c/kWh). On peak is a little (47c). The leaf that charged last night charged ~3hrs@6.2kWh. That would've been close to $10 at peak times. Is it going to bankrupt me? No. Will the fiance enjoy me paying $10+ for strangers to use our driveway? No. Lol  When i said I'm in a gap, I really am lol. Im in the middle of about a 100mi gap between chargers, and even then the ones at one end arent 24/7. There is 1 j1772 open during business hours 50 miles north of me, and no more for another 50 miles after that. Its very likely that some will be charging from near empty depending on which direction they're headed.  For me, one car isn't an issue. I'm just a little worried since it only took 2 weeks to find me, what multiple charges a month could add up to. At the same time, I'm probably the only one with a J1772 nearby, so without my share there is a big section of the highway I live off of that's risky to road trip in an EV."
electricvehicles,396fec,Phaderus42,5,Tue Jun 9 17:26:53 2015 UTC,"I am the only charger for about 30 miles in any direction, but I have only had two people use it in two years. I wouldn't worry about charging people unless you start getting a lot of visitors. Personally, I would just say ""off-peak charging is preferred due to peak charge rate of $xx during the following hours:"" in the description. I think most people will take the hint and do the right thing.   Also, with that high of peak rate, you should consider a few solar panels. They would pay for themselves pretty quickly."

electricvehicles,396fec,thx1139,2,Wed Jun 10 11:45:47 2015 UTC,"Charge during peak hours if you must. But try not to be profiteer. Depending on how valuable your time is, the effort to collect will be more than the cost. <br> A battery holds an average of 24Wh. IF this hypothetical empty EV rolled up at peak hours, that may be $12 over 5 hours. To be clear, this equals $2.40/hour. State this explicitly on your plug share map info. I'm sure the supply demand of things will pan out. <br>My guess is there won't be long term use like the scenario described. And you can always change your terms after that other station is running."

Label your home as a business, like some doctors do, and I see no issues with your endeavor. The idea of home chargers was similar to a phone call in the time of no mobile phones & only land lines. Remember a time when you could knock on a door and ask to use the phone? They didn't charge you. It was polite to share a phone. Now that there's mobiles, would you share your phone? And would you charge them if you did? Then start a business. Otherwise be polite. It makes the community better."

electricvehicles,38yc6f,motley2,4,Sun Jun 7 22:40:26 2015 UTC,"Experience in one application doesn't necessarily directly transfer to another application.  As an example, we all know laptops and cellphone batteries tend to degrade pretty quickly, to the point of uselessness or outright failure within 2-3 years.  The Tesla Roadster is a good counterpoint, on account of a) production vehicles have been in operation for 5-6 years now and b) Plugin America has conducted significant survey information.  http://www.pluginamerica.org/surveys/batteries/tesla-roadster/vehicles.php  There are 19 Roadsters with age at time of survey exceeding 5 years. Of these, 1 has reported a motor swap and 7 have reported battery swap (1 or more of the 11 sheets replaced). The battery swap is an alarmingly high statistic; but bear in mind that Tesla has historically been very aggressive about swapping large assemblies out on any type of failure, and then diagnosing the failure and presumably refurbishing the assembly afterwards.   I would be very curious to see data on how many of those swaps were due to minor component failures (ie sheet refurbished and returned to service) and how many were due to major component failures that rendered a sheet or entire pack unusable.  Of these 19 roadsters with 5 years of wear and tear, the average battery degradation is 8% and the highest degradation is 21% (vehicle with 74k miles)."
electricvehicles,38yc6f,protomech,3,Mon Jun 8 02:36:26 2015 UTC,Phone batteries degrade quickly because we use them 24/7.  Car batteries get used about 1 to 2 hours per day.   So a very simple estimate would be to expect a car battery to last 12 times longer than a phone battery.  I don't know much about electric motors but there are lot of EVs and PHEVs out there and there doesn't seem to be a big warranty issue.
electricvehicles,38yc6f,DominusFL,3,Mon Jun 8 14:18:54 2015 UTC,"That's partly true; the primary factors in battery degradation are calendar aging, cycle count, storage charge, and storage temperature; discharge rate and charge rate are typically much smaller factors.  In particular, runtime doesn't matter nearly as much as depth of discharge. 30 minutes of runtime @ 70 mph (about 50% of a full cycle in a LEAF) will wear the battery proportionally more than 60 minutes of runtime @ 40 mph (about 40% of a full cycle).  Phones are in use much more during the day, though at a lower average discharge rate, and many users will average almost one cycle per day or more if charging mid-day. Because phones are expected to be replaced every couple of years, manufacturers are free to select less-durable chemistries that may wear out after only a couple hundred cycles in favor of other characteristics, for example a chemistry that is more energy dense."

A lot of the subsidies they mention also apply to any form of manufacturing, are there any car manufacturers that are not subsidised by governments?

Once there's enough cars on the road, it might be possible to start up a battery swapping business that can compete with those prices.    I would offer two options.   You own your battery, as you do now.  When you swap, you lease a battery.  The leased battery could be of any size.  As you drive across the country, you get a fresh battery at each swap station, but eventually you bring the car back to the original swap station and your battery is returned.  The price you pay could be based on how many swaps you did, size of the leased battery, and/or duration of the lease.  Not too different from what Tesla is doing. For frequent long distance travelers, you can sell me your battery and permanently lease one from me.  The advantages of this are; a.) you don't have to worry about returning to the original swap station to get your battery back after a trip, b.) you don't have to worry about a battery going bad or loosing range over its lifetime, just visit a swap station and get a different one, c.) swap costs could be included in the lease, thus streamlining the swap process, d.) you could lease a smaller battery for a lower monthly charge, when you're around town commuting, e.) you can easily take advantage of new, more power dense battery technology as it becomes available."

That might be big enough carrot that gets people to sign up for the service.

However I'll be the first to admit I'm jealous of the greater interior space the Prius has; I can't fit more than a weekend getaway worth of stuff in the volt.

From a pure economic standpoint on gas it looks to be nearly a wash as you'll use roughly 2 gallons of gas in either car.  My napkin math says .2 gallons/day in favor of the Volt.  If you count the cost of buying a car it's a negative.  However cars are seldom purely economic and logical choices.  If they were there wouldn't be several types of cars.  It sounds like you are tired of your car and are interested in the Volt.  As an older guy I'd say if that's what you want and you can swing it without issue then get what you want.  You're spending 7-8 hours/week in your car so you should be happy in it.  If you do decide to get the Volt I'd try to get one with a high lifetime mpg.  The batteries will have cycled much more often, but most of your driving is on engine so you'll prob want one that has not been used very much."

It does vary from area to area, depending on how much coal is used in the electrical grid, but in even the worst parts of the country an EV is better then almost any car; if you live in the part of the country with the highest % of coal, an EV is the equivalent of about a 34 MPG car; in most of the country it's much better then that.

electricvehicles,38b6f7,rogless,2,Wed Jun 3 02:08:49 2015 UTC,"First, congrats on being open minded, and considering buying an electric vehicle.  That alone is a big deal!  Here are some important questions you need to ask/answer, as there are so many variables, and we don't want any confusion.   What state are you located in? Which electric vehicle(s) are you considering? Are you talking about hardwiring a new charging station, or using an existing outlet? What do you mean by sufficient power, is the circuit dedicated, or did you talk to an electrician? In feet, how far is the spot from that power source? What's the budget? I assume you've secured permission of the parking lot owner and/or building manager?   Don't let these questions overwhelm you, but they are important.  Pedestal charging stations do exist, but they are usually commercial grade (or at least priced that way).  Most electric vehicles come with a portable level 1 EVSE (also referred to as a charging station, since the charger itself is built into the vehicle), which can be upgraded via EVSEupgrade.com to a level 2 station (and can be done even when leasing the vehicle).   In most cases, the portable form factor should do the job, so you can put it away when not using it.  If you do want to leave it in your parking spot, then a ClipperCreek with the pedestal option might be a good idea, although this Bosch pedestal setup might be the best bang for the buck, since those pedestals tend to run $700-$900 last time I checked.  Depending on your parking lot layout, you might be able to fabricate a cheaper solution (such as hanging the portable version off a hook mounted on a rod/post).  Also, if you haven't already, check out plugshare.com, which is the top app/website showing nearby charging stations, reviews, etc.  Once you give us some more details, we can provide you with more accurate help."
electricvehicles,38b6f7,kemingerror,2,Wed Jun 3 11:12:35 2015 UTC,"Florida  The Chevy Volt or Ford C-Max Energi (so plug-in hybrids, really).  Hardwiring a new charging station  We're considering tapping the power of a nearby light pole.  The pres of my association (a contractor by trade, I believe) measured the amount of power drawn on that pole's line/circuit (forgive my electronics illiteracy) and found it to be minimal, especially since we've converted from the old gas bulbs to LEDs.  I'll email him for the exact numbers, but it was like .5 out of a potential 100 <insert proper unit here>.  10-15'.  We can assume the station will be located next to the pole, if that helps.  Depends on whether this is a one-off for my exclusive use or an amenity for the condo, I suppose.  I've made it clear I'll settle for a regular 110 outlet tapped off the power pole (i.e. level 1 charging).  Just spitballing though, I'd say < $2000.  That's not a hard limit, though.  I'm on the board of the condo, and have talked it over with the other members.  I have the green light.   These questions definitely aren't overwhelming!  They are exactly what I need to arrive at a solution.  A pedestal would fit the ""condo amenity"" use, but just an outlet would suffice if I had a portable charging station.  Level 2 would be optimal, but I'll settle for level 1 if need be.  I'll check out the links you provided.  Thanks!"
electricvehicles,38b6f7,kemingerror,2,Wed Jun 3 14:00:04 2015 UTC,"Alright, that helps.  Both those vehicles have a max. charging speed of 3.3kW, so if pricing/infrastructure was an issue, you could get away with a standard outlet.  Which brings me to my next question.  I assume the light pole is 110V, or is it powered by a 240V circuit?  And if 240V, what type of breakers are you dealing with.  If it's only '110', your options are limited to a 15A (level 1) outlet (20A is the max, but need to account for those LEDs).  If you are saying the LEDs use 5A, then you can't use the circuit at all, even with a 15A outlet.  If you can do Level 2, I'd consider either one of the ClipperCreek charging stations, or even this GE unit since there's a major pricedrop (moving sale), which also gives you RFID access control, and at 30A, it can keep up with the faster chargers.  To give you an idea of what Level 2 charging speed you might want: Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles usually have a 3.3kW charger(~16A), Battery Electric Vehicles (Honda Fit EV, Nissan LEAF, ...) usually offer a 6kW (~30A) option.  Then you have the Tesla Model S, which can potentially accept up to 80A, depending on configuration, etc. (only Clipper Creek has an affordable 80A charging station).  30A makes the most sense (again, assuming you have 240V access).  Don't forget to mark the parking spot (paint it if possible, and install a 'no parking unless charging' type sign)."
electricvehicles,38b6f7,kemingerror,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:01:13 2015 UTC,"I emailed my condo board pres to ask him, and he's pretty sure we're 240V on that light pole, but he's going to double check in the electric room.

Unless you are running some sort of race, I doubt you will stay at full load non-stop.  I have a drift trike that has a 9Ah battery. I can go from LVC (dead battery, so to speak) to full in about 1.5 hours. I get about 15 miles per charge. I use, at MOST 230 watts when charging.  That is .345 kWh of electricity for 15 miles of range. Now, if you want to talk about a REAL bike, with gearing and a good Bafang or Cromotor, you can easily triple that range.  The real answer is it will depend on the battery chemistry (SLA is really bad), the mechanical's (is it geared? rolling resistance?), and the setup (controller, does it have regen, etc...)"

A guess is that Honda and Toyota looked at their market and realized people who own their compact cars put on a lot of mileage in a day. So pure EV is out. Hybrid probably  makes sense...hydrogen on the other hand is a complicated infrastructure change so not sure why Toyota is looking into it. Arny (terminator) tried the hydrogen highway project and it failed  because the infrastructure change was too big of a hurdle...where I live (Canada) the electric/hydro company cut a deal with telecom provider to put ev stations with cell booster stations.

Say you had a hybrid battery pack, with the majority being a high-energy, low weight battery (LiS, for example) and a smaller ""capacitor"" of higher-power battery (LiMn2O4/LiFePO4/NCA) or other form of capacitor (for acceleration), which got you upwards of 250kWh.  Then, you've got a car that can road-trip somewhere around 800 miles/12 hours on a single charge, then spend 8 hours plugged in to a  40kW charger overnight, and by the time you're ready to go the next morning when you're ready to go.  And if you're talking a 300 mile vehicle as ""long range,"" you would only need about 100kWh for that, and even a 20kWh charger would get that topped off overnight.  So honestly, unless you're not able to charge overnight, I don't believe that superchargers will be necessary at all"

Just ""high-power system"" would be fine. No need for the word ""capacitor"".   The system you have in mind is one that combines a high-power with a low power. Although I could see this working for commuter scale range, there is a subtle problem - you cannot really make it as adaptable as a tandem power-energy single battery. There will always be a shortcoming: if you have too much of the high-energy, someone will find it takes too long. If you have too much of the hi-power battery, someone else will find that it doesn't quite cut the mustard with occasional long distance driving. Even if the high power battery itself can charge fast, supply the motors and charge the low-power battery simultaneously, the input power is still dictated by the low power, high energy battery and to some extent vice versa, though output delivery is usually higher for both types of batteries.  Also the ""high power system"" may be more redundant than you may realise - batteries will be faster to charge first off. the Tesla Model S's battery takes only 20 minutes or so to get the initial half-charge, so having an empty ""low power""  battery may actually weigh less for the same range and not really that much less power.  TL;DR Market realities dictate an ideal combination of high power and energy in tandem; otherwise you get ""cutoffs"" in battery properties."
electricvehicles,37bc9c,DerelictMuntersnatch,0,Tue May 26 20:50:43 2015 UTC,"you cannot really make it as adaptable as a tandem power-energy single battery   Actually, I'm pretty sure you can do it in a single battery pack.  I ran the numbers with two different chemistries, one with 1/20th the specific power of the other, but 3x the specific energy, and when they have matched voltages (based on the safe useable range of each), the charging profile is roughly thus, with the discharge being comparable:   Charge both until the High Energy is at ~2-3% and the High Power is at ~50% Then the High Energy takes the overwhelming majority of the power until you're around 50%HE/55%HP Then they advance together, with the HP battery taking roughly 2/3 the input until the HP is at capacity, and the HE is at 75% Then the HE tops off to the voltage limit   ...all that done by virtue of natural voltage balancing.  As such, all you have to do is balance the Ah of each chemistry so that they have a combined safe Amp-output that meets the limit of your system (controller and/or fuses).  Say you want a battery pack that weighs about as much as Tesla's 85kWh pack.  You could easily achieve that at 190kW of instantaneous power, by having a 210kWh HE/15kWh HP pack in parallel internal to the battery.  Sure, it'll take about 5 hours to charge the thing fully, but that should get you about 10 hours of highway driving, and the battery chemistry itself does all the work.  Increase the mass of the pack by roughly 10%, and you're up to a 250kWh hybrid pack that will get you as far as most anyone would reasonably want to drive in a day.  Even better, because of the different voltage curves, measuring the voltage of the parallel packs will get you a much more accurate State of Charge than with current, single chemistry packs.  ETA: And yeah, towards the end (the last 1/4) you'd be ""limping"" along with enough power to maintain 60mph, but not to accelerate quickly, but who's going to want to accelerate like the dickens after 9 hours of driving?"

Does OP really live so far from work that he needs a 220V charge, to get home or will 110V do and they're just trying to get a bit extra ""free"" charge from work?

electricvehicles,379tvt,ElectricNed,2,Tue May 26 16:37:44 2015 UTC,"I think the best thing would be to see if the facility manager would be willing to change out the single-pole breaker serving one of the outlets for a double-pole one of the same current rating, and changing the receptacle to suit. A NEMA 6-20 or L6-20 would fit in the same enclosure but probably need a different face plate. Less than $20 investment, though, if they are willing. You'd then need to make yourself a pigtail adapter for that plug to wherever the TurboCharger uses. I think that all would be code-compliant and clean."
electricvehicles,379tvt,ThatOneGuyDotNet,1 point,Tue May 26 17:36:55 2015 UTC,"^ That is the only way I would do this, if you can get the facility manager to play along.

electricvehicles,379tvt,fooljoe,5,Tue May 26 18:53:15 2015 UTC,"If they're each on separate breakers, then yes it's possible. As /u/ElectricNed pointed out, it's much easier if the hots are on different legs so you can use a quick220-type device. I carry a homemade one of these around in my trunk most of the time. Here's a great thread about it in the mynissanleaf forum.  Since there are 4 outlets and they were installed specifically for EVs (I assume) then it's very likely that they're all separate circuits, and fairly likely that at least 2 of them are out-of-phase. You can test this before investing in a quick220 with a simple voltage tester and an extension cord. Just test the voltage between the hot (smaller) slots of the two outlets: If they're on the same leg, there'll be 0V; otherwise there'll be ~240V or ~208V (more likely with commercial service.)  One other thing - a quick220 won't work if the outlets are GFI outlets! Trying to charge between two GFI outlets will cause them to immediately trip. And unfortunately, almost all recently-installed outdoor outlets are GFI protected.  If the outlets are GFI protected, or are all on the same leg, it's still possible to make this work, but probably not worth the effort. Basically you have to custom wind a transformer to keep the two circuits isolated - there aren't any off-the-shelf products for this, but if you dig through the MNL forum you can find the schematics for it.  One last caution if you're going to proceed with this, and something /u/ElectricNed also alluded to: Don't draw more current than 80% of the minimum rating of the two outlets! Assuming both outlets are 20A, then a TurboCord should be OK, since it has a 16A pilot, but if one or both outlet is only a 15A outlet then you should use a 12A EVSE. You're better off with a customizable EVSE like an openEVSE or an evseupgraded unit where you can adjust the current setting. There's nothing ""automatic"" about the car or the outlet or the quick220 that knows to limit how much current you pull, so you need to use the right EVSE for the job."
electricvehicles,379tvt,fooljoe,1 point,Tue May 26 03:55:47 2015 UTC,"Ah! OK, this morning I measured with a multimeter and sure enough, they measure around 210V between two neighboring outlets.  But alas, they are all GFI! So my dream is crushed for now.  Thanks for taking the time to explain."
electricvehicles,379tvt,ElectricNed,2,Tue May 26 15:13:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the GFI certainly kills the dream. If you're committed, here's the page of the mynissanleaf thread that shows how to use an isolation transformer to achieve this. I haven't tried this myself, but it seems interesting.  On the other hand, you could probably just live with 120V - that's way better than the nothing I have at work. :( If you buddy up with someone in facilities maybe you could even convince them to convert an outlet or two to 208V. It's a fairly simple procedure - basically just swap out the receptacle and breaker."
electricvehicles,379tvt,AmpEater,4,Tue May 26 17:09:22 2015 UTC,"It is sometimes possible, but not code-compliant and depends on how the circuits are wired. Commercial installation s may not work since they are usually served from three phase powers. Do a Google for Quick220. Essentially, you are hoping to find two outlets which have a hot conductor from opposite legs of split 240/208 service. You will only ever get double power, though, not full typical L2 current- so 12A if the circuits are 15A rated, 16A if they are 20A rated."
electricvehicles,379tvt,ElectricNed,2,Tue May 26 02:09:48 2015 UTC,"No, its volts X amps for total power. Any other understanding is an over-simplification for people who don't really understand electricity."
electricvehicles,379tvt,AmpEater,5,Tue May 26 03:39:21 2015 UTC,You are wrong. Power = volts x amps. Source: engineering school.
electricvehicles,379tvt,fooljoe,1 point,Tue May 26 06:43:12 2015 UTC,You're projecting.   If I charge a 1v battery at 1000 amps am I pushing more power into in than a 1000v battery at just 1 amp?
electricvehicles,379tvt,kieranmullen,1 point,Tue May 26 07:13:22 2015 UTC,"Of course power = volts * amps, but many EVs unnecessarily limit the amperage when on 120V to 12A, while the circuits here are likely 20A, meaning it's safe to draw up to 16A. So in practice doubling the voltage with a quick220 or similar will result in more like a 2.7x gain rather than a 2x gain in charging rate.  In the commercial setting like we have here, however, you generally get 208V rather than 240V, so the gain is a less impressive ~2.3x.  However, yet another factor that comes into play and can make the boost even better is that most on-board chargers are more efficient on 240V than they are on 120V. In my Rav4-EV, for example, I've tested the efficiency and found it to be a mere 66% on 120V vs 80% on 240V. And, surprisingly, this was dependent on voltage and not power: I tested 240V @ 6A and 120V @ 12A and found the 240V efficiency to still be much better. So if the difference I saw is typical, then combining two 120V outlets could result in up to a 3.2x increase in effective charging rate!"

I have done a ton of research on electric cars and I have decided I'm getting the e-Golf and even test drove one recently.   Don't buy an electric car right now. It's stupid because if Tesla really does create a mass market $35,000 car with 200+ mile range then anything you buy today will be a piece of crap compared to the Tesla Model 3. That also means that your resale value will be incredibly low and you'll either be forced to drive a car with very little comparable range or lose a lot of money on a 3 year old car. Let the dealership absorb the depreciation and lease an e-Golf instead. The e-Golf is a great car, it feels like a real car and has more usable cargo space than the Leaf. It also isn't as ugly as a Leaf, which looks like someone ate, then vomited an escargot (it was designed by the French). There have been some issues with car as reported by the e-Golf owners' Facebook page. Issues regarding the 12 volt battery have come up as well as issues regarding the VW Car-Net app (kind of like VW's version of On-Star) where the app doesn't interface with the car properly to allow things like delayed charging (so that you can program the car to charge during off-peak hours). Mechanically however there hasn't been anything brought up by owners of the car. It's a very simple design with just a 1 speed direct gearbox. Aside from that, since the e-Golf is built on the same body as every other Golf there are a ton of after-market accessories and parts like hitches, bike racks etc. that will bolt on without an issue. Also, every e-Golf owner that encountered issues has said that VW's corporate customer care should always be contacted regarding any issues since even the best VW dealers are pretty clueless about how to fix e-Golf issues. If you open up a service ticket with VW Care they will interface with the dealer and tell them WTF is up. Otherwise you'll spend more time at the dealer than you have to. Do your research on charging at home. If you cannot charge your e-Golf at home you'll be giving up the biggest advantage of owning an EV - which is always having a full charge when leaving home. Also charging at public chargers can cost nearly as much as gasoline depending on where you're forced to charge. It's good that you can charge at your main office, but learn how much it will cost to set up a home charger before getting an EV. Also, don't bother spending big bucks on the Bosch charger that VW recommends. It's a hard-wired charger and it's more expensive than a simple and equally compatible Clipper Creek HCS 40P which you can unplug and take with you if you ever move.   BTW, what state do you live in?"

electricvehicles,371vgr,pdrayton,1 point,Tue May 26 00:12:00 2015 UTC,"Not an e-Golf owner, but seriously considered it when we were recently in the market for an EV. We are HUGE Golf fans, own a GTI and just adore it, so the e-Golf was high on the list. The fact that it is ""just a car that happens to be electric"" was a huge win for us compared to the Leaf or BMW i3's ""I'm wierd, look at me"" styling. Sadly it is only sold in some states though - we had to drive 3 hours to an out-of-state dealer to test-drive it. We generally liked it: it drives like a regular Golf, maybe a little heavier feel/more body roll compared to our GTI, but overall a decent ride. The torque from EVs kind of compensates for the overall slowness, so I think around town it would feel somewhat ""nippy"" to drive as long as you're willing to mash the throttle and recharge daily. The biggest downside was the car feels heavy, but unlike in the Tesla and Mercedes B, the weight is up high enough to work against the car in corners, not with the car. In the end we decided against the car primarily because even with calling all over the area we live in, NONE of the VW dealers would service the car since they were not yet trained on e-Golf. Owning a car and needing to car-transport it to another state for maintenance wasn't on my list of things to do for 2015.  Tried out the Leaf, it was OK but had horrible frontal impact crash test ratings so we ruled that out. Consumer Reports went so far as to retract their ""Recommended"" status on the Leaf - see here.  In the end we settled on the Mercedes Benz B-class. Like the e-Golf, the B-class is ""just a car that happens to be electric"". It's quicker than the e-Golf (0-60 about 2 seconds faster), more luxuriously appointed, and looks just like a normal car. Also the weight feels better placed, cornering with quite a bit less roll than the e-Golf. The other wonderful thing about the B-class is that unlike VW, I can get it serviced locally even though MB doesn't sell it in my state yet. Amazing, a company whose dealers actually honor the USA-wide warranty that the parent company sells! The dealers were willing to do out-of-state leases, so you could take advantage of the solid lease deals on the B-class. Lastly, if you can get them there are some very solid Fleet discounts available, up to $7k off MSRP before the usual dealer discount, manufacturer incentives, state & federal incentives, etc. so in the end you might find the MB isn't that much more expensive than the Golf - comparing a e-Golf SEL to a lightly option B-class the prices were within $2k of each other for IMO a nicer car."

Teslas have better range and charge faster. They just cost a lot more. In time BMW will have bigger batteries you can upgrade to.

When I called my company (Progressive) the first agent said they were unable to insure the MB at all since he didn't have it in his system. Talked to his supervisor who was able to quote me, but the cost for the MB (car worth ~45k) was literally 2x the cost for the Tesla (car worth ~90k) since they had no rate tables from their underwriters for this car yet. Yes, insuring the cheaper car was 2x as expensive since they had no experience insuring them yet.  The happy ending to the story was that the supervisor followed up with the underwriters, and came back to me a few days later with the right codes for the MB which put the insurance for the MB right back in line with normal cars in that price range, and less than the Tesla (of course).

electricvehicles,36q7w9,MuaddibMcFly,1 point,Thu May 21 16:27:39 2015 UTC,Every ferry I've ever used was always very windy. I wonder if the drag of a small 10KW wind turbine on one of those masts would outweigh the benefit of having a wind powered generator on board.
electricvehicles,36q7w9,G65434-2,2,Thu May 21 15:13:33 2015 UTC,"I think it would depend on the directionality of the wind.  If it's a head wind, you might not gain as much as the additional drag would lose you.  Tail winds or cross winds would be good, though.  As such, unless the prevailing winds are parallel to the primary direction of travel, it would almost certainly be worth doing something like that.  ETA: Actually, if you have a path parallel to the prevailing winds, it'd likely be worth putting lots of turbines up, and feathering the blades when you're driving into the wind, and then relying on the additional push of the wind (and power generation) to make up for the additional drag when you're working against the wind."
electricvehicles,36q7w9,MuaddibMcFly,2,Thu May 21 16:10:29 2015 UTC,What if the turbine could rotate so it could be matched to make sure the wind was always hitting it?
electricvehicles,36q7w9,Randomd0g,2,Thu May 21 21:44:10 2015 UTC,"That would be the default, but the question I'd have is whether the additional drag on the turbines from a headwind would be offset by the additional power generation going to the motors."
electricvehicles,36q7w9,MuaddibMcFly,2,Thu May 21 21:46:27 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it is the case that turbines would be bad in headwind, as turbines don't convert 100% of their drag into power.  As /u/fooljoe said, a sail could probably do a better job, as they can convert any angel offset from headwind into forward motion link."
electricvehicles,36q7w9,secondlamp,1 point,Fri May 22 06:12:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree.  Two (or more) Airfoil Sails could easily be used to turn a headwind into forward motion, by angling them correctly."
electricvehicles,36q7w9,MuaddibMcFly,2,Fri May 22 17:02:51 2015 UTC,"Putting the energy of the wind and vessel speed differences into a water propeller using a mechanical link with a wind turbine should be possible, and the result of the drag would be an area of slower wind behind the turbine.  I'm not sure whether a mechanical link is more desirable than a generator though.  http://www.nalsa.org/DownWind.html  This shows that it is possible to travel upwind using only the power of the headwind, using a landyacht where the turbine powers the wheels.  ""The big difference in the two crafts is that in the upwind version the *turbine actually powers the wheels while in the downwind version the wheels power the *propeller. In neither case is there any motor, battery or flywheel used for storage."""
electricvehicles,36q7w9,InfiniteBacon,2,Fri May 22 07:41:08 2015 UTC,"There are a few major differences, there.  For one thing, the drag of the turbine is a significant portion of the overall air resistance of that land vehicle, which would not be the case for a ferry.  Additionally, the fact that the motors would be pushing water, which can be moved out of the way makes it less efficient.  At the speeds & forces you're talking about, I'm almost completely certain that generator-cable-motor would be a more efficient linkage than gear-shaft-gear, if only because of the energy spent spinning a driveshaft going from the top of the ferry to the bottom will almost certainly be more than the generator & line losses.."
electricvehicles,36q7w9,MuaddibMcFly,2,Fri May 22 17:07:55 2015 UTC,"The amount of energy potentially captured by some wind turbines (assuming cross or tail winds of course) during the 20 minute journey (~3 kWh if your 10 kW suggestion is reasonable) is tiny compared to the consumption of the ship.  If there are consistent and favorable winds, a good old sail would do the best job of saving energy. Wind turbines charging the batteries at each pier could help supplement the grid too. Of course, since the local grid is 100% hydro anyway, it's doubtful that there's any need to invest in additional on-site generation."
electricvehicles,36q7w9,fooljoe,1 point,Thu May 21 23:35:32 2015 UTC,"3 kWh if your 10 kW suggestion is reasonable   That's still 3kwh that the ship doesn't have to pull from the weak grid. Also, one of the benefits of driving an EV is its regenerative properties. What could we add to this ship that would help it self regenerate small amounts of electricity? A few wind turbines?   a good old sail would do the best job   if the winds aren't favorable, you have a large useless mast. Place a wind turbine atop said mast and you have electricity no matter the direction of the wind."
electricvehicles,36q7w9,G65434-2,2,Fri May 22 12:37:23 2015 UTC,There could be also regen properties in the propulsion propellers? They are not constanly on since the ferry is coasting to dock and braking tiny bit by propelling in the other direction?
electricvehicles,36q7w9,Vipix94,1 point,Fri May 22 17:03:21 2015 UTC,"If you've ever driven a boat before you know that water resistance generally stops boats really fast.

electricvehicles,36q7w9,fooljoe,2,Fri May 22 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"That's still 3kwh that the ship doesn't have to pull from the weak grid   The issue with the weak grid is power, not energy. The grid there is supplying plenty of clean hydro energy, it just can't handle the huge spikes in demand that charging the battery would require.   Place a wind turbine atop said mast and you have electricity no matter the direction of the wind.   No, if there's a headwind the turbine would be even worse than a ""useless mast"": You can take a sail down but a turbine is always up there causing drag. If the winds aren't favorable for a sail they're not going to be favorable for a turbine either. I'm not really arguing for a sail, by the way - I'm just pointing out that if you were really bent on using wind energy (not sure why) a sail would do a better job than a turbine on board."

electricvehicles,36q7w9,G65434-2,2,Fri May 22 20:19:20 2015 UTC,"A headwind means a wind blowing from directly in front, opposing forward motion. The more drag you introduce, the more forward motion is opposed. Any energy captured by the turbine will necessarily be less than that spent by the ferry overcoming the drag it imposes."

electricvehicles,36q7w9,fooljoe,2,Thu May 21 23:29:24 2015 UTC,"You could put superchargers at the pier, though.  If you arrive just as the ferry leaves you have 50min (2x20min for round trip + 10min (un)loading) for a full charge.  Can the grid handle that?  Worst case:  Vehicles in ferry = 120 vehicles  120 Model S = 120 x 85kWh = 10200 kWh Power for full charge in 50 min = 10200kWh / 50min = 12240 kW  150 kWh / roundtrip (ferry also charges at other pier) 150kWh / 50 min = 180 kW for charging the ferry  Power per pier 12240kW + 180 kW = 12.42MW Power for 2 piers = 12.42MW * 2 = 24.84 MW   TL;DR Worst Case: 25 MW for charging 240 Model S + ferry  I don't know if the grid can handle that, but:   Not every Vehicle is a 85kWh Model S (smaller batteries on average) the ferry probably isn't always fully loaded (fewer batteries) not all vehicles arrive as the ferry leaves or arrive at 0% charge (less charging)   So (as per definition of worst case scenarios) it only gets better from here."

Then later it says ""This battery pack onboard, like the ones on each pier, corresponds to the effect of 1600 standard car batteries"" which implies that all 3 packs have the same 260 kWh capacity.  Then again, 1600 standard car batteries should correspond to more like 850 kWh, so either they meant to say all 3 batteries combine to that much or the on board pack or the 1600 car batteries should correspond to the on board pack only and the authors just screwed up.

electricvehicles,36iihu,AFDIT,1 point,Tue May 19 17:16:17 2015 UTC,"If they are producing more than they need then they were not built on ROI business model but rather tax breaks and incentives.  If it wasn't for free money it would not have worked.   I am all for alternative means of generating power for my leaf but the cost should be spread throughout the consumers not everyone.  For example if someone is off grid, they are paying for the power though taxes to support alternative energy.   People often complain about the cost of education being too high because of subsidized money.  The same is happening to these projects with subsidized money."
electricvehicles,36iihu,kieranmullen,0,Wed May 20 18:21:14 2015 UTC,"Taxing, offering breaks / incentives are great for many reasons:   Direct consumers towards best options for society through altering the free market economic model. Direct business towards forming better options for society's growth. Help kick-start these businesses.   If you want to endorse clean energy sources it is quite right to do it through tax incentives / breaks.  Now, although these islands may produce more than they require, there is no negative issue with this.   If it wasn't for free money it would not have worked.   Not only do I not believe this is the case but I think it falsely compares this energy creation to others eg Natural gas, coal, oil and Nuclear - all of which are subsidised. Why is clean energy judged differently?  I think we will see a substantial shift in power among energy network operators, suppliers and consumers in the coming decade if the cost of solar, wind and local sourcing is continually teased to end consumers.  Tax incentives would not need to exist forever once economies of scale and enhanced technology / materials reduce costs. Just as EV incentives will not last forever, neither will they last forever in terms of energy generation."

For other people that range is just silly. Now taking a used car that you know will start to degrade if it hasn't already, and you're looking at something people think is a disposable car.  My lease is up in a couple of months and they're pressing pretty hard for me to make a decision about what I want to do with it. I'd probably buy it for $10k or so, but I'll likely just turn it in and look into either buying a different used one or just go without for a while, until Tesla's Model 3 comes to market."

I'm seeing 100+ miles in my use case, and it's more than sufficient for my needs. I very rarely use that much capacity in a day. With that said, why would you choose a car with limited range if it were barely acceptable for your situation?  The car is definitely of limited use, but even with depreciation it's a super cheap car to own."

Right now I would have to level 2 charge which turns a 2 hour trip into a 17 hour trip.   I chose this car because I'm done with gasoline. I haven't had a gas car for the past 10 years.

One at the Nissan dealership in Waco and one somewhere in Hillsboro would open it up to EV roadtripping.   And as for Tesla, the only reason I don't have a Model S right now is because the car's doorway was too short and punched me in the side of the head every time I got in the car.

electricvehicles,36iy38,merkwurdig_lieber,9,Wed May 20 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't take this as a bad sign for the Leaf or electric cars in general. It's more that ICE cars are an extremely mature technology, so there is little functional difference between today's model and a model from 5 or 10 or even 20 years ago. Whereas EV technology is progressing rapidly, particularly with battery tech, so the depreciation is going to be more like the depreciation of electronics. How much is a $1,000 laptop from 3 years ago worth used today? That makes the value drop on the Leaf look very mild, actually.  There's also probably a bit of a gap between people who are currently in the market for a EV (early adopters with some disposable income) and the people who are in the market for a used compact car (people looking to buy something cheap)"
electricvehicles,36iy38,sprashoo,2,Tue May 19 23:51:18 2015 UTC,In Australia it's the opposite. They hold their value very well. Mind you there aren't many on the market. The very cheapest lost about 7% / year. But many are still close to the original price.
electricvehicles,36iy38,AndTheLink,2,Tue May 19 23:15:35 2015 UTC,"When you can lease a new one for $199, it's hard to justify charging more than $12k for a used one, because otherwise the used car loan is more than the new car lease.  Also, the pre-2013 units have been dropping faster because they have 3.3 charging, while most 2013 units have 6.6 charging (not all).

In 2012 Audi's R8 E-Tron concept vehicle lapped the ring in 8 minutes, 9 seconds and its 0-62mph acceleration was only 4.2 seconds and top speed of 124mph(a far cry from the P85D).

electricvehicles,36ag1b,joinmybandwagon,4,Sun May 17 19:39:51 2015 UTC,"Currently the Volt only gets 37MPG, and still requires premium gasoline at that. For 140 miles a day with no recharging, you'll burn about the same amount of gas as you would driving a Prius, plus you're using electricity too, and you pay more for the car, and have less interior space.

electricvehicles,36ag1b,Halfworld,7,Sun May 17 23:03:51 2015 UTC,At least the 2016 volt now has arange of 50 miles on electricity and uses regular gas. Now it just has to come out.
electricvehicles,36ag1b,BraveRock,1 point,Sun May 17 23:26:55 2015 UTC,"you'll burn about the same amount of gas as you would driving a Prius   Volts get 40mpg highway (which if his commute is THAT long most of it is likely highway). 40 miles electric, 100 miles gas = 2.5 gal/day  Prius gets 50 mpg highway. 140 miles = 2.8 gal/day  At the end of the year, just on his commute, the Volt would use 75 less gallons of gas, quite a bit better than ""about the same amount"", plus further savings on days when he's just around town and can be all electric. And he'd have a far more enjoyable driving experience.  Moot point since volts aren't sold in the UK, but the Volt's mere 40mpg is enough to give it the advantage up to around 200 miles. At which point people should just live closer to work."
electricvehicles,36ag1b,ViperRT10Matt,1 point,Tue May 19 19:27:36 2015 UTC,"75 fewer gallons of gas is only about a 12% difference, and on the flip side you'd end up spending several megawatt hours of electricity per year charging the Volt's batteries. This would most likely cancel out any benefits of burning less gasoline, both in cost savings and in environmental benefits. Admittedly the exact numbers depend on a whole host of other factors, which might tip the scales in the Volt's favor, but probably not enough to warrant spending the extra money."
electricvehicles,36ag1b,Halfworld,1 point,Tue May 19 22:21:09 2015 UTC,"So the Volt burns ~640 gallons of gas a year at 20 cents higher a gallon for about $130.  Who knows what will happen to gas prices, but it's $190 for the additional gas for the Prius at $2.50 a gallon.  So, $60 a year savings?  Hardly worth it.

electricvehicles,35yec4,G65434-2,2,Fri May 15 15:20:42 2015 UTC,"If my leaf had a 48KWh battery, it would get 200 miles too.   Doubtful. Rated miles in a leaf are very optimistic. For instance on a full charge the Leaf will show that it has 111miles of range. But the EPA rates it at 84 miles of range. The farthest I ever drove my Leaf on a full charge was 85 miles. At highway/freeway speeds the Leafs range drops precipitously. The rated range is only accurate in good weather in urban/suburban low-speed driving.  On a full charge my Tesla Model S 85D shows 272 miles of range, and the EPA rates its maximum range at 270 miles. The rated range is much more accurate even when traveling at interstate speeds.  Nissan needs to improve the range of the Leaf, and the accuracy of their range estimation."
electricvehicles,35yec4,paulwesterberg,1 point,Tue May 19 20:31:20 2015 UTC,"so I get 84 miles on a 24KWH battery, that means if my leaf had the P85D's standard 85KWH battery, I should be able to go roughly three times as far; or 252 miles in my leaf. Teslas website says the p85d can travel up to 275 miles. I'm not arguing efficiency, Im simply pointing out that a larger battery in the leaf would yield more range."
electricvehicles,35yec4,G65434-2,2,Tue May 19 20:42:06 2015 UTC,"The Leaf is more efficient on a miles per kWh basis which is good because it doesn't have a huge battery.   Adding a larger battery would more kWh would provide more range, but it would also add extra weight which would reduce efficiency so there is definitely a point of diminishing returns.   The best way to add battery capacity is to use improve the battery chemistry so you can hold more energy per kg and m3. Improved chemistry could also require less raw material and reduce manufacturing costs."

electricvehicles,35qfew,slev7n,4,Tue May 12 17:39:29 2015 UTC,Bullshit! There is no way that half of the energy used by an EV is wasted in the suspension.  Science education needs to be improved badly.
electricvehicles,35qfew,AmpEater,2,Tue May 12 18:19:31 2015 UTC,"...yeah, I'm trying to figure out how they came up with that number.  I think it might not be a question of the energy from a battery being wasted but a question of the energy directed into the shocks that is normally wasted, in the process of dampening motion.  For example, if your vehicle is cruising along at 30 mph, and you hit a speed bump, you both lose forward momentum (cutting into range) and fail to gain energy back.  With a proper design of this, you could end up reclaiming some of that energy in the initial hit, plus more on every subsequent oscillation as the shocks stabilize your vehicle.   Likewise the vertical motions when you turn (inboard shock compresses, outboard extends), decelerate (fore compress, aft extend), accelerate (fore extend, aft compress), etc.  Then there are all the tiny little road imperfections, which, with a sufficiently light wheel, would translate to tiny, nearly constant, motions of your axle, which could hypothetically generate small levels of energy constantly.  If the energy generated thus is equal to 1/2 the energy spent traversing that distance, that would asymptotically approach doubling the range.  That seems rather unlikely, but it's not completely out of the realm of possibility.  It really depends on the efficiency of translating the vertical motion of the wheels to electrical energy.  I think their 50% energy recouped per mile is a fantasy based on ideal (read: impossible) conditions, but the principle isn't impossible."
electricvehicles,35qfew,MuaddibMcFly,1 point,Wed May 13 00:39:57 2015 UTC,Agreed - but I could see the 10% claim could being a reasonable stretch goal.
electricvehicles,35qfew,defiancecp,1 point,Wed May 13 00:01:10 2015 UTC,"You mean 0.10%?  Simply have a look at a traditional suspension system. The only way this system can lose energy is by transforming the kinetic energy into heat and dispense it. But you know how thiny the systems are build, no water cooling, not even cooling fins or fans. That means, the amount of waste energy must be very very little."
electricvehicles,35qfew,Destione,1 point,Wed May 13 16:48:52 2015 UTC,"The only way this system can lose energy is by transforming the kinetic energy into heat and dispense it.   Technically true, but that's not the only possibility, here.  Normally the energy is put into the system as kinetic, and most of it is pushed back out as kinetic.  What if part of the shock absorption system was magnetic in nature, driving over coils?  Then instead of most of the energy being pushed into compressed gasses, you could have a chunk of it pushed into batteries, and the gases for resetting it"
electricvehicles,35qfew,MuaddibMcFly,1 point,Wed May 13 17:12:47 2015 UTC,"This makes zero sense. The science of this is all wrong. There is no way to make any reasonable amount of energy from suspension because there is no reasonable amount of energy put into it. Certainly no where near the amount the article estimates.

electricvehicles,35qfew,Snugglosaurus,0,Wed May 13 20:19:42 2015 UTC,"because there is no reasonable amount of energy put into it.   A shock converts mechanical energy to heat, it makes perfect sense that you could capture some of that energy. How much is the question.  And there is more than you think. In 60 seconds I have gotten my shocks hot enough that I couldn't touch them. This was on an autocross course so it isn't representative of every day driving but even on a smooth road a shock is not static.  ke = 1/2mv2 - The velocity is low but the mass is very high, so there would be a decent amount of energy available. Probably not what was quoted in the article but enough to make a small difference."
electricvehicles,35qfew,Kriegenstein,1 point,Fri May 15 14:44:46 2015 UTC,"You're not taking into account that the suspension also has to be reset to it's original position. You can't just take the energy from dropping the car an inch (which yes, will make a decent amount of energy). You then need to raise the car an inch (which also takes a decent amount of energy). You will gain something, sure, but not anything worth pouring any kind of money into."
electricvehicles,35qfew,Snugglosaurus,1 point,Sat May 16 15:04:00 2015 UTC,The spring suspends the car and would be responsible for maintaining the height of the car. The shock has nothing to do with it what you are talking about.  The shock dampens the movement of the spring so it does not keep oscillating. To keep a 300+ lb per inch spring that is holding up a 3000lb car from oscillating takes much more energy than you think.

DEP provides these rebates as incentives to assist Pennsylvanians with the incremental cost of purchasing an alternative fuel vehicle.  ""Alternative energy options are central to making Pennsylvania's environment beautiful and sustainable for years to come,"" acting DEP Secretary John Quigley said. ""We encourage everyone to consider these renewable and clean technologies.""  To qualify, the vehicle must be registered in Pennsylvania, operated primarily in-state, and be purchased no more than six months before the rebate application is submitted. The rebates are funded by the Alternative Fuels Incentive Grant Program, which is supported by a gross receipts tax on utilities.  Large-battery vehicles that have battery system capacities equal or greater than 10 kilo-watt hours (kWh), including models such as the Nissan Leaf, Ford Focus, BMW, Tesla, and Chevy Volt, are eligible for the highest rebate amount of $2,000. DEP is also extending rebates of $1,000 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery-electric vehicles with battery system capacities of less than 10 kWh, including models such as the Toyota Prius plug-in, Ford C-Max Energi, Ford Fusion, and Honda Accord.  Rebates of $1,000 are being extended for natural gas, propane, hydrogen, or fuel-cell vehicles, such as the CNG powered Honda Civic or any 2014-15 CNG powered car or pickup truck. CNG original equipment, manufacturer retrofits, or certified conversions to CNG or propane are also eligible for the $1,000 rebate. A $500 rebate is available for electric motorcycles and scooters.  There are only a limited number of rebates available at $2,000. The rebate program offered will be reassessed upon payment of the first 250 rebates at $2,000 or December 31, 2015, whichever occurs first."

electricvehicles,35dax3,Quality_Bullshit,2,Sat May 9 11:18:20 2015 UTC,I think the bmw i3 needs changes like AWD and a bigger or more powerful battery. Real world BEV range can be only forty miles in Winter. Hill climbing in Winter is not too good with the all season tires. The REX slows acceleration and worsens handling. There have been reliability issues with the REX too. The nineteen inch low profile tires wear fast too. Even with distance control off the active cruise control will sometimes randomly disengage annoying traffic and risking an accident. With gas prices low in the US the car is a harder sell. The car also home charges at half the speed of a Tesla. The i3 uses innovative design features like CFRP and ABS panels to keep weight down.
electricvehicles,35dax3,jimythetulip,2,Sat May 9 20:20:49 2015 UTC,"AWD and a bigger battery would be a great way to make the car cost twice as much. I live in Canada and own the Rex version. It performed impressively in the winter. I spent $12 in gas this winter and haven't used the rex since the temps warmed up. No winter tires yet and I had no issues with traction either. The car handles and accelerates like a champ. Most active cruise control systems will disengage in late day oncoming sunlight or other weather issues not just BMW. For me the car is an easy sell. 95% of my driving is electric now at half the price of a Tesla. My daily commute is 95k round trip. The charging rate has never been an issue for me, the car charges to full in 4 hours. Every time I get in the car it's full. I'm not waiting around  for it to charge. Best car I've ever owned by far."
electricvehicles,35dax3,jimythetulip,1 point,Mon May 11 19:56:26 2015 UTC,"AWD in the model S was not too pricey. Active cruise control will also disengage if there is a sharp dip in the road. I tend to wish for just regular cruise control. The sensors are bonkers, sometimes it thinks you are going to hit something and yet nothing is in sight. If you drive hard off the line the tire wear will be excessive on the i3 compared to most other cars. The i3 is surely an innovative car, but it is not right for everyone. The small turning radius and compactness of the car are desirable though in the city."
electricvehicles,35dax3,Vik1ng,2,Mon May 11 20:26:28 2015 UTC,I love the cruise control and use it daily in gridlock. Haven't had any issues with the sensors. Good thing the tires cost $145 and not $490 each like the Tesla. I agree the i3 is not right for everyone. Just like a VW Golf isn't right for everyone and it shouldn't be compared to an S Class Benz the way that people often compare the Tesla to the i3.  That's the only point I'm trying to make. There's a market for every EV available today. They all have their applications.
electricvehicles,35dax3,Vik1ng,1 point,Mon May 11 20:57:38 2015 UTC,"If you go on tirerack tesla tires can be had for similar prices as the i3 for the base model S. Any individual car can be a lemon from any maker. A make and model of car can be very reliable but some people will have lemons. I feel like BMW over sold the i3, showrooms had up signs saying the BEV had a hundred miles of range even after the EPA rated it 81 miles. Many did not know their range could be half that in Winter. Then this engine mount issue adds insult to injury for some. Some had issues with the rEX as well throwing a lot of warning lights. BMW has bought some of the cars back. Hopefully BMW finds a real solution to the engine mount weakness. Some people have had issues with limp mode on the rEX and BMW has been working on a fix to that as well."
electricvehicles,35dax3,Deletraz,0,Mon May 11 21:28:36 2015 UTC,Until BMW finds a real fix for this problem it is hard to recommend the car. Out of warranty repairs would be thousands. It also poses a real safety problem whereby a drivetrain failure could result in a fatal accident.

electricvehicles,35a3uv,AFDIT,6,Fri May 8 11:33:19 2015 UTC,"I think you need to make a car with 100-125 mile range. You basically have Tesla with 200+ miles and the Leaf with ~80 miles but nothing in between (other than hybrids).  Something in the middle would appeal to people that have longer commutes but can't afford a Tesla.  My commute is about 35 miles, so a Leaf won't do it with enough margin to run errands or account for construction delays and/or accidents. And I can't charge at work. If I had a car with 100+ miles of range I would feel comfortable using it for a daily driver."
electricvehicles,35a3uv,motley2,3,Fri May 8 18:22:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I was thinking.  Most OEMs are doing the bare minimum to get ZEV credits (70-80miles) or 200+ miles.  But there's nothing in between.   A 125 mile BEV would be both affordable and useful.  An it would still be useful in winter even after 10 years of battery degradation.  A 80 mile BEV won't be useful after 8 years.   AS u\G65434-2 mentions,  a BEV won't necessarily use much propulsion energy in traffic but it still uses energy to condition (heat/cool) the cabin."

Stopping/slowing down uses regenerative breaking and in the leaf ,""B mode"" uses regenerative engine stopping. Slowing down from 30Mph to 0 results in a 3.0KW/h recharge rate.

The LEAF isn't Nissan-Renault's only electric vehicle, of course, and it's sold worldwide.   According to Nissan's US director of electric vehicle sales, the company has sold just over 75,000 LEAFs in the USA to date.

The only possible way to ""charge"" and electric vehicle that quickly is by pumping liquid electrolytes into a flow battery reservoir.

Nah, not by a long shot.  5% of the energy that goes into an 85kwh car is enough to melt ~30 kg of aluminum or steel.  And the supercharger wires are far more than 3-5% efficient.  Although a 5 minute charge only requires 100 times more power than a supercharger, you're still right about the arm thickness.  A 10x thicker cord is not impossible but water cooling the wire could make it about the same size as it is now."

I'm not an engineer, but from what I understand about electric motors (please correct me if I'm wrong): unless you re-coil the motors with thicker wires, I don't see any way of getting more power out of the motors (unless it's been controller limited). If you re-coil the motors then you're going to use more electricity no matter what."
electricvehicles,352hyt,pavelt,2,Wed May 6 21:03:21 2015 UTC,Thicker wires allow more electricity to pass through without burning up the motor.  Best guess is that the styling improvements funnel a lot more air at the motors for cooling.  Sustained operation at the 900 hp range would still burn out the motors

It was first introduced in 1981  and the last one was built in China on 16 January 2013.  The use of the ""Santana"" badge rather than ""Passat"" echoes the use of different names for the sedan versions of the Polo (Derby) and Golf (Jetta).  In North America, it was also known as the Volkswagen Quantum. In Mexico, it was named the Volkswagen Corsar, while in Argentina it was sold as the Volkswagen Carat. In Brazil and other South American countries it was known as the Santana, while the Passat Variant B2 wagon was marketed as the Volkswagen Quantum. In Europe, the Santana name was dropped in 1985 (with the exception of Spain, where the Santana nameplate was retained) and the car was sold as a Passat. European production ended in 1988.

It's almost like we're just evaporating or the gasoline or pouring it down the drain when we burn it.  Weight is more permanent.   The ratio of pounds per petrol gallon is 6lbs (water is 8lbs), so it also increases the number to talk about weight rather than volume.  I had not considered the real heft of a gallon until now, and I don't think most people have.  I can say to a non-EV owner: ""You burn 500 pounds of gasoline to go 2400 miles in 6 weeks.  My 500 pound battery will last me at least 100,000 miles and 8 years."""

electricvehicles,34p1il,LordoftheLemmings,1 point,Sun May 3 07:39:43 2015 UTC,Why do you want them to think differently about gasoline? What do you expect this knowledge to accomplish?    Because understanding the extent of a problem is the first step in finding a solution. Weight is something that can be experienced directly and most people can make a direct connection to some previous experience like trying to lift a large child. Volume on the other hand always has to be conceptualized and not everyone is good with spatial intuition.   What does this have to do with electric cars?   Because the whole reason EV's as a movement has become as popular as it has recently is because we are trying to burn less gasoline.

That's a pretty significant loss of efficiency, as the energy is transformed into heat rather than charging batteries.  And then there's the fact that cutting a hole in the ground leads to potholes; the damage buses do to roads is bad enough without adding weak points.  It'd be more practical to have some sort of charging attachment overhead at those same stops, so that when the bus comes to a stop at the bus stop, it makes a physical connection through which the charging can be done."

The motor, controller and frame are also rock solid. I've really abused it and never had trouble with anything but the batteries (on account of no BMS) I took it as an excuse to upgrade to higher ah LiFePO4 cells and used the old cells to power various small EV projects, like a monster battery eBike and a small boat."

A prime example would be cell phones, which are common in the third world even though landlines never happened. Again, an infrastructure problem.  The reason the third world faces a fuel transport challenge is because in addition to lacking gas stations they also lack quality roads. Much of the third world still transports goods via bicycle and hand cart because a car simply isn't feasible. But if you suddenly give these people an electric-assist bicycle you've given them the ability to transport many times the cargo load in a fraction the time. This also creates new job opportunities because the bikes can be charged by placing them on a center stand and paying a local kid a few cents to charge the battery through regen.  The transport problem is a lot more complex than ""oh, they'll just get our old shit when we're done."""

electricvehicles,33r8q7,Ribbys,-3,Sat Apr 25 16:19:15 2015 UTC,"For personal vehicles, batteries are good enough.  For Semis?  Trains?  Not so much.  A Semi needs to move 80,000 pounds.  At the rule-of-thumb 10 pound-miles per Wh, that's 8kWh per mile.  At 10 hours of over the road driving a day, you're talking about somewhere around 500 miles.  That's 4MWh per day.   At the national average of 10.19¢/kWh, that translates to $407.60 per day.  Even at 4mpg (the low end of semi fuel-efficiency), those 500 miles only translate to 125 gallons of diesel, which at current national average of $2.747/gal is only $350.  Are you going to pay an extra $50 per day, per truck, while hauling less merchandise due to battery weight?  I mean, maybe if electric motors are more efficient on the average semi than they are on the average personal vehicle, but if not... it really may be a better option to have a semi designed as a Plug-in Hybrid, if only because it would be easier on the Grid.    I  mean, can you imagine having a truck stop having to supply 24MWh to the 6 trucks in their yard?  That's enough to power 300 homes for the same period of time (assuming an even distribution of of the average national consumption of 10,908 kWh per year.  One day of Electric Semi driving is roughly comparable to 16 houses added to the grid.  Could it handle that?    Edit:  So, I looked at the Mercedes B Class, VW Golf, Toyota Rav4, and Ford Focus, comparing the EV vs ICE, and using a version of /u/badcatdog's formula it looks like we're looking actually looking at closer to 3.5-4kWh/mile.  That brings us down to ""only"" 2MWh/day, so it's ""only"" the equivalent of 8 houses per semi, and $203.80 per day.  Assuming a safety buffer of 500kWh, you're talking a battery cost of $625,000.  Even at a savings of $150/20 hours, you're still looking at a payback time of 9-11 years, with somewhere on the order of 3x the maximum number of charge/discharge cycles.  ...and that's assuming that you can even find somewhere to draw 250kW for 8 straight hours.  Let's put that into perspective: that's equivalent to two Tesla Supercharger plugs for 8 hours.  And the worst bit?  In order to carry that much power, even with the most energy dense battery I know of (LiS), you're talking 5,000kg.  Or roughly 1/8th your load.  Given that, doesn't it seem like it'd be a much better idea to have only about 200-500kWh of battery, and an on-board diesel generator/range extender?  Then the infrastructure is already in place, you'd still be able to take advantage of plugging in (and/or lining the trailer with solar panels), your diesel generator could always be operating at peak efficiency,  and you're only losing about 1/40th your legal maximum load to transportation costs.  Don't get me wrong, I'm as big on BEVs as any of the rest of you are, but seriously, people, it's not a panacea, just an amazing solution to the personal transportation problem."
electricvehicles,33r8q7,MuaddibMcFly,5,Sat Apr 25 02:47:32 2015 UTC,"Your math is wrong if you come out with electricity costing more than gas. Mainly because every pound you add to a load adds less to the fuel bill than the last pound. It's why a freight train can move a ton of cargo something like 100 miles on one galon of diesel. You can't just say so many lb-miles per Wh, linearly."

electricvehicles,33r8q7,MuaddibMcFly,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:31:37 2015 UTC,"Here is an estimate with actual numbers.  Lets say an ICE equiv of the  Tesla MS gets 30mpg and a MS gets  3mpKWH. This suggests 1 gal ~= 10kwh.  A modern heavy truck does ~6 to 12 MPG, and so requires 5 to 2.5x the battery storage of the MS using the Tesla drive/charge cycle. A MS has 70- 85kwh of pack.   So, for the same driving style as a MS, a heavy truck would need a pack in the range of 175kwh to 425kwh (2.5x70 to 5x85). A MS pack should cost around $250/kwh currently, and hopefully half that within 5yrs. At $250, this gives a pack cost of  $44k to $107k.  Power companies are enthusiastic about EVs. Partly because of the possibilities they provide in improving grid stability as controlled/influenced storage devices.  Edit: Actual truck: http://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2014/05/transpower-transforms-the-trucking-industry-with-ev-big-rig-trucks-with-zero-emissions-at-la-ports/  These trucks do ""1.3 kilowatt-hours of electricity per mile"" at 65mph. This is on the efficient/cheap side of my estimate range, though they carry 270 kwh packs, with a range of 88.2 miles (3kwh pack / mile), so I assume they are a bit amateurish in pack design.  Charging: Tesla SC stations have up to 8 stalls, charging at up to 675kw total (4x135). There have been no grid problems."

True, which may make it even worse for Semis; the drag coefficient for the average production car these days is somewhere below half that of the average semi.   ..but again, that approximation is still assuming a car.  The power required to push 1.5 tons up a 2° incline is going to be significantly less than that required to push 40,000 tons up that same exact hill.

In fact there are paths for cell degradation that are purely a function of charge time for a given temperature. So very slow charging can be worse for a Li-ion cell than a more typical charge current simply because a very low charge current implies a long charge time and greater damage. Heat is the worst problem and a high charge current will heat the cells so I am not suggesting that high charge currents are a good idea either but stay away from very slow low current charges as well. I base this on a video by Professor Dahn. Here is a link to that:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxP0Cu00sZs  Edit: This is a long video but well worth watching (maybe at 2x speed).

The Tesla's a pretty big sedan, and the RAV4 is a pretty compact SUV.  Surprisingly, the drag coefficient and cross-sectional area on the RAV aren't all that much worse than the Model S. The Model S has a smooth .24, but even though the RAV4 EV looks like a big chunk, it sneaks in at .30. There's only a difference in the cross section of 264 sq. in.

The 60kWh, 70kWh and 85kWh Teslas have more range because they have proportionally larger battery packs (and a higher price).  The RAV4 EV's EPA rating is listed at an unrealistically low 103 miles for two reasons:  The RAV only charges to 80% by default, and will only charge to 100% when that option is selected, so the EPA (inexplicably) gave it a lower score. Pretty much everyone who has a RAV4 EV beats the EPA range on a regular basis.  The RAV4 also has a less efficient resistive heater versus the Model S' efficient heat pump, so the Model S gets better range in cold weather.   On a full charge in temperate weather, though, they're pretty similar."

Did you opt out of said class action lawsuit? If so, you could probably take Nissan to small claims court and win yourself a new battery. If not, you're probably outta luck, although I don't know how ironclad those class action settlements are. You should definitely post to mynissanleaf.com, as /u/jes2 suggested. And if you want to get serious, you'll need a lawyer. I find it hard to understand how a settlement that can give one person a brand new $6k battery yet give another absolutely nothing, just because one might have seen 1% more degradation or driven 1000 less miles over 5 years could be described as ""fair"", but the law works like that sometimes...  I definitely feel your pain, as I also drive a 2011 Leaf that currently has 9 capacity bars and about 70% capacity. I'm good in the mileage department, as I'm only at 40k, but it's going to be a real nailbiter as to whether I can drop that 9th bar in time to get a new battery before the 5 years are up. I may be wishing I opted out as well."
electricvehicles,338nfj,fooljoe,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:41:41 2015 UTC,"Fooljoe, no I didn't opt out. When the suit went through my LEAF seemed to be doing well. I was thankful for the extra security but honestly didn't think it would degrade that fast.  I suppose the battery warranty is a warning as to how many miles Nissan actually thinks a person will get out of the car with regular use. Warranty is up at 60k so you'll get 65k out of it, just enough to miss the warranty.   I will keep my fingers crossed for you that the last bar drops before you the warranty goes up.  Take care!"
electricvehicles,338nfj,Big_Baby_Jesus_,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:59:00 2015 UTC,"If it were me I might just try to take Nissan to small claims anyway. I think there's a good argument to be made that the ""result"" of the class action lawsuit - the capacity warranty - was put in place by Nissan anyway, so there was actually no real benefit to the plaintiffs. If the terms of a settlement don't actually give you anything are you really bound by it? Separately, there's a strong argument to be made that the implementation of the capacity warranty is not a reasonable representation of how the batteries actually degrade, and unduly favors those who drive close to the 12,000 miles/year figure.  The degradation is a function of both time and mileage, in roughly equal proportion. So in theory, a person who drives 120,000 miles in 2.5 years, a person who drives 30,000 miles in 10 years, and a person who drives 60,000 miles in 5 years should all experience exactly the same amount of degradation with the same defective battery. But if that level of degradation is enough to qualify for a warranty replacement, only the last person ""wins."" I fail to see how that's an equitable distribution of compensation.  Anyway, as I mentioned you'd probably need a real lawyer to tell you your chances. But who knows - maybe just serving Nissan with notice of your suit would be enough to give you something - credit for 50% off a battery replacement or discount on a 2015 Leaf perhaps. Someone else suggested you try your letter in a more public forum like twitter, maybe that'd help.  Good luck, and thanks for crossing those fingers for me too!"
electricvehicles,338nfj,fooljoe,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:32:37 2015 UTC,"your ~22,000 miles/year goes beyond ""normal use"" I guess   That's damn near double normal use."
electricvehicles,338nfj,LVOgre,1 point,Thu May 7 04:22:36 2015 UTC,"It's about double the average mileage per year, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily outside the ""normal"" range. And there's no reason to believe that driving that much exposes the battery to any increased risk for degradation (beyond a mostly linear trend as a function of miles and time.)  As I pointed out in a long conversation with /u/LVOgre elsewhere in this thread, the warranty as designed penalizes high-mileage users like /u/dramakatze (and also very low mileage users) in a way that's probably unfair given how these batteries degrade. It appears so far that degradation is as much a function of time as it is miles, so someone who drives 120,000 miles in 2.5 years might expect the same level of degradation as a person who drives 60,000 miles in 5 years. But if that degradation is enough to qualify for a battery replacement, only the person in the latter case would qualify.  Also important to realize is that the warranty wasn't announced until 2013, by which time /u/dramakatze might've already driven his 2011 Leaf 45,000 miles. How could he have been expected to know that his level of driving would disqualify him from getting his defective battery replaced, while someone with the same defective battery who happens to have a ""normal"" commute would get a free battery?"
electricvehicles,338nfj,fooljoe,1 point,Thu May 7 17:00:24 2015 UTC,"It's about double the average mileage per year   Yeah, like I said, normal use.   there's no reason to believe that driving that much exposes the battery to any increased risk for degradation   Increased charging cycles. That's the important distinction. You have to understand the life cycle of lithium batteries. It's less a function of mileage, and more a function of charge/discharge rates and cycles."
electricvehicles,338nfj,LVOgre,1 point,Thu May 7 22:18:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like I said, normal use.   The point of my comment was that ""average"" is not the same as ""normal."" The amount of people who actually drive the average amount is miniscule; ""normal"" must be defined as some range around the average value (perhaps + or - two or three standard deviations.) It's disingenuous to claim that 22,000 miles a year isn't normal without first defining normality in terms of a distribution then establishing where 22,000 miles/year falls on the distribution.   Increased charging cycles   You took my statement out of context. I said ""any increased risk for degradation beyond a mostly linear trend as a function of miles and time."" Obviously mileage matters insofar as it's a proxy for charging cycles, and degradation is of course a function of charging cycles. My point is that it's a basically linear function - 2x the miles should roughly equal 2x the degradation. There's no ""extra"" risk beyond that linearity that one would be subjected to by driving that much, and therefore there's no reason to claim that driving 2x the average amount somehow violates ""normal use"" as far as a warranty might be concerned."
electricvehicles,338nfj,fooljoe,1 point,Fri May 8 07:28:18 2015 UTC,"The amount of people who actually drive the average amount is miniscule   Actually, the amount of people who drive within the average range would be much higher than those who drive less or more. That's essentially the definition of average. 'Normal' in the United States is the area around 13,000 miles per year, and contains the vast majority of drivers. A standard deviation of 9,000 miles from that point is a ridiculous assumption. That would put normal anywhere between 2,000 and 22,000, which is a ludicrous. If you accept that 22,000 is a normal amount of miles driven per year, you must also accept that 2000 miles is normal. Neither is normal.   2x the miles should roughly equal 2x the degradation.   Not necessarily. You're neglecting charging and discharging rates. If this 22,000 mile per year driver drove 5 days per week, every week, that would be about 85 miles per day. This use case is probably commuting 40+ miles to work. No doubt this is going to be primarily highway travel with a high discharge rate sustained over a long period of time. That will have a very large impact on the life of a lithium battery, and will drastically change the expected life."
electricvehicles,338nfj,LVOgre,1 point,Fri May 8 08:29:41 2015 UTC,"That's essentially the definition of average.   No it isn't. The average is a single point estimate, and it's quite possible that nobody actually drives that exact amount. You used the phrase ""average range"", which could have meaning if you were to define what determines the boundaries of that range, but nowhere did you do that. My whole point was that the number of people actually driving the exact amount of the average is miniscule, so some range must be defined.   is the area around 13,000 miles per year   Again you refer to ""the area around"", but don't attempt to define what it is.   A standard deviation of 9,000 miles from that point is a ridiculous assumption   I suggested + or - 2 or 3 standard deviations as a possible definition of the ""normal"" range, but didn't pretend to have the data to quantify that statistic. Apparently you do have access to the data, as you seem quite sure that a standard deviation of 9,000 miles is ridiculous. Care to share your data?   Not necessarily. You're neglecting charging and discharging rates   Nowhere in your follow-up do you establish that higher mileage driving is correlated with higher charge and discharge rates, except for some vague conjecture about this being primarily highway driving, and more conjecture about highway driving meaning a ""high discharge rate sustained over a long period of time."" Neither of these are verifiable.  Furthermore, your point about higher charge/discharge rate (were that actually the case) leading to accelerated degradation is not supported by the data. One argument you could've tried to make is that all this driving might require DC quick charging (although again we have no idea if that's true in this case), which conventional wisdom says should accelerate degradation (the manual even warns against it - so it might be reasonable to void a warranty on this basis.) However, this study suggests that even in the extreme case of quick charging every day the difference in degradation is trivial, and completely dwarfed by the effect of exposure to ambient temperature over time and miles."

There are very few valid complaints about capacity loss in the Leaf, and this certainly isn't one of them.  There isn't a need for liquid cooling in every battery system. The leaf gets along just fine without it in the vast majority of circumstances. There were some isolated issues of degradation from heat, and those batteries were replaced by Nissan without cost to the owners.  The leafs that had the issue are early models that were driven hard in hot conditions, and the issue was dealt with appropriately by changing battery chemistry. The current battery performs very well in hot conditions, and eliminates that problem."
electricvehicles,338nfj,LVOgre,4,Tue Apr 21 13:51:57 2015 UTC,"There were some isolated issues of degradation from heat   The issues are FAR from isolated - more like pervasive. Nissan has done everything short of admitting that the 2011 and 2012 batteries were defective, and in large part degraded much faster than expected, except in the coolest climates.  The capacity warranty in question was the result of a class action lawsuit because of this defect, but it doesn't do nearly enough to address the problem, as only those who were ""lucky"" enough to have very severe degradation got a battery replacement, while those with ""only"" severe degradation, like OP, get nothing - even though both sets were subject to the same defect."
electricvehicles,338nfj,fooljoe,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:29:35 2015 UTC,"The issue wasn't pervasive, it was extremely limited in scope. There was no such admission from Nissan, and the warranty is the warranty regardless of how it was initiated.  In the early models, there wasn't a lot of data to compare with. It was definitely a risk to become an early adapter. Regardless of that, the warranty provided is for 60,000 miles, not 65,000 miles. If it were 65,000, would you expect Nissan to honor it at 70,000? If it were 70,000, should they honor to 75,000?  Where do you draw the line?"
electricvehicles,338nfj,LVOgre,3,Wed Apr 22 03:14:01 2015 UTC,"The issue wasn't pervasive   I'm not sure what exactly you're referring to as ""the issue"", or why you refer to it in the past tense, but perhaps we're not talking about the same thing.  Are you thinking of the very early capacity loss experienced by some Phoenix drivers? If so, realize that was just the first, and most obvious, symptom of the underlying problem - that the 2011-2012 (at least) Leaf batteries are far more sensitive to heat than they should've been, and that the average degradation seen thus far is significantly worse than the ""80% at 5 years"" figure from early Nissan statements. This is what I'm referring to as ""the issue."" Those Phoenix Leafs didn't have batteries that represented some sort of rare defect - ALL 2011-2012 Leafs have the same ""defect""; it's just that those Phoenix Leafs were the ""canaries in the coal mine"", so to speak.  Refer to the battery aging model put together by mynissanleaf.com forum members, which is the most scientific analysis that exists on the issue. It shows that even in nominal weather conditions, the average predicted capacity at 5  years is less than 75%, get into moderately hotter climates and predicted capacity drops off quick. Not until you get into climates as cool as Seattle do you get close to the fabled 80% expectation. And remember we're just talking about the average degradation - even in Seattle around half of all Leafs should see worse than the promised 80% number - this is a far cry from ""a few isolated incidents"", as Nissan tried to play off the early indications of the problem.  So anyway, yes being an early adopter is risky, and yes OP's out of luck as he's outside of the terms of the warranty. But my point is that the terms of that retroactive warranty are an inadequate response to the problem (that could be the fault of the class action lawyers as much as of Nissan), and Nissan's overall handling of the issue has been terrible, from their initial denial of the problem to their vagaries about battery replacement options to their performance-sapping software updates and ultimately their deception about the warranty itself, e.g. claiming protection below ""about 70%"" capacity when the real figure where the 9th bar is lost is about 65%. And why a 65% warranty when Nissan originally claimed 80%?  Ultimately, in this case being an early adopter sucks, but if Nissan's serious about being a leader in the EV field they could do a lot better by their customers. Most of us early adopters probably won't be buying another Nissan EV, despite our early fanaticism for the brand and their aggressive entry into the market."
electricvehicles,338nfj,fooljoe,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:37:49 2015 UTC,"This is precisely the issue I'm talking about, the Phoenix problems, as it's the only issue that's been thoroughly reported. There was an issue with the early models in hot climates related to drivers who drove outside the normal anticipated usage case. I did a great deal of research on this before I bought mine.  I also object to your use of the term ""scientific"" with reference to the modeling done at the leaf forums.  At the very least, the sample is questionable, biased, and incomplete, and the methodology is weak. It's spitball math using questionable samples. Scientific calculation would be done using data from a large and disperse sample, such as that available to Nissan through the Carwings software and dealer data.   The reality is that the number of reported problems is relatively small, and the majority of drivers won't experience degradation outside of the expected projections. With the new battery, though long term data isn't yet available, the chemistry should address the issue.  Finally, the warranty, even if issued late, is the same warranty granted on a new leaf today. I'm not sure why early adopters deserve better than that."

Obviously that's correct. However, Nissan has released zero information based upon the data available to them, which is why I said the battery aging model is the most scientific analysis that exists. And while the sample size is not great, the methodology is not at all weak and is subject to public scrutiny. Compare the alternative offered by Nissan - meaningless ""5 star"" annual battery reports!   The reality is that the number of reported problems is relatively small   If you believe this then perhaps you haven't been keeping up with the issue since your initial research, or you just have a very strict definition of ""problem."" Refer to the many degradation threads at mynissanleaf and you'll see that degradation like OP and I have experienced is very much the norm, not some sort of rare occurrence.   With the new battery, though long term data isn't yet available, the chemistry should address the issue.   I hope you're right! But how does that help 2011-2012 buyers? And I'm glad to see you finally admitting there is an issue! ;)"
electricvehicles,338nfj,fooljoe,1 point,Wed Apr 22 08:35:19 2015 UTC,"There aren't a significant amount of complaints. Even if you count every instance on the forums, you're looking at a number well under 1%. It's not a pervasive issue. I know it looks like that from the perspective of someone affected, but reality and mathematics disagree.  There was absolutely an issue, an issue that affected a small number of owners in a significant way. That's what I've been saying. It's not as pervasive as you'd have me believe."

Where do you draw the line?   To address this specific question, I think the right thing to do, and what the class action settlement should've done, would be to offer a prorated payment to all 2011-2012 buyers, commensurate with their level of degradation, either in the form of cash or (more likely) as a credit toward a battery replacement. This makes a great deal more sense than the ""all or nothing"" system currently in place, which rewards people for falling within some arbitrary limits, despite being subject to the same defect. So in OP's case, with his relatively heavy usage, he should receive some credit toward a battery replacement - perhaps $4000 of the estimated $6000 cost (obviously a more scientific formula could be applied.)"
electricvehicles,338nfj,Tildah,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:49:09 2015 UTC,I think you're asking too much. This is the same warranty offered to purchasers of a new Leaf. I don't understand where the entitlement comes from.
electricvehicles,338nfj,LVOgre,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:12:39 2015 UTC,"Purchasers of a new Leaf also get a battery that's since had its chemistry altered to (hopefully) address the defect present in 2011 and 2012 models. And purchasers of a new Leaf also know the terms of the warranty going in and so can plan accordingly. The warranty as-is is perfectly fine for them.  For purchasers of 2011-2012 Leafs it's a different story. The capacity warranty wasn't announced until 2013 - what good does that do someone like OP who drives 22,000 miles per year and might've already been over 40,000 miles deep when the announcement came that if he wanted protection against battery degradation he'd need to limit his driving dramatically over the next 3 years? All that was in place when we bought our cars was a ""promise"" by Nissan that we should expect 80% capacity at 5 years and 70% at 10.  As far as ""entitlement"", again I recognize that being an early adopter comes with risks - and personally, I expect to receive a new battery under the warranty, so I can't complain (supposing all goes as planned.) However, my issue is again that the plaintiffs ""won"" the class action lawsuit, yet while all members of the class are affected by the alleged defect, only an arbitrary subset of them will receive any form of compensation under the terms of the settlement. In what other type of class action is compensation meted out so arbitrarily?"
electricvehicles,338nfj,jes2,1 point,Wed Apr 22 08:11:53 2015 UTC,"There necessarily needs to be a limit set. 5 years or 60,000 miles isn't arbitrary, it's exactly what you were promised. Average usage over 5 years at 12,000 miles per year (typical warranty math) is 60,000 miles. There's nothing arbitrary about that, you just told me that:   ...when we bought our cars was a ""promise"" by Nissan that we should expect 80% capacity at 5 years and 70% at 10.   I understand the frustration, I don't understand the disconnect."
electricvehicles,338nfj,jes2,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:36:58 2015 UTC,"Thats fine, but it wouldn't be an issue if the milage wasn't a premium in the Leaf.  I can buy a tesla and comfortably get to work and back for 2-3 days. I can scrape to work and back in a Leaf at max charge and full battery bars.  Also as has been said, Nissan didn't do any battery protection/heating/cooling. No surprise.  I dont have enough for a Tesla now, but when they realise the Model 3 for $35,000 pre-tax credit. You can be sure as hell where my money will go."
electricvehicles,338nfj,stevejust,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:49:43 2015 UTC,"The model 3 is an empty promise at this point, don't hold your breath on that price point. I'd be surprised if it comes in under $40k pre tax credit. Additionally, I purchased a leaf for $25,000 brand new before the tax credit, so I paid $18,500 for it. If I lived in a state with incentives, it could have been as low as $15,000 or even lower. It's an economy car at an economy price. It's not exactly the same class as Tesla's offerings.  Your lifestyle also makes a difference. My circumstances make a Leaf a solid option. My entire region is only 30 miles across, and I drive less than 8k miles per year. I can trip to work and back 3 times on a charge in the Leaf, and I have a home charger ($500). It's all about how an EV fits your lifestyle, and the Leaf makes sense for lots of people.  Additionally, liquid cooling isn't a necessity in a DC system. The design of the Leaf is such that it doesn't need liquid cooling. It operates just fine without it, and the VAST majority of owners have had no issues with the battery. The few that have had any issue at all (and I'm not counting people who've exceeded the warranty and feel they deserve special treatment) were fringe cases.  The Nissan Leaf is a solid car, like most of Nissan's cars, but it doesn't fit everyone. Tesla is in a different class, and if I could afford a Tesla I'd be driving one. I suspect lots of people are in the same boat, EV or not. I'd drive a Chevy, for instance, not a Cadillac.   Tesla's quality doesn't take away from the quality of a Nissan. If you need more range at an economy price, nobody offers that yet, and there's no reason to expect it."

I saw a video recently of a GM engineer saying the Volt had a 16.5 kWh battery pack (good for ~61 km depending on how you count) but only 8.9 kWh (numbers from memory, sorry, but ballpark) was actually used. About 2 kWh (again from memory) was used as an over 85% buffer and the rest was a backup for the end of the warranty. Check other PHEVs coming out with about the same range, they all have a much bigger battery pack than the range suggest.  Edit: Damn, can't find that video.

It takes around 300kWh to create hydrogen needed to fill up Toyota Mirai (5 kgs), and Mirai can do 300 miles. With 300kWh, electric car can do 900 miles. Is wasting 2/3 of energy green?  Alternative is to make hydrogen from natural gas (95% of hydrogen is created today this way), so technically hydrogen is fossil fuel, and this process releases huge amounts of CO2. Natural gas mostly comes from fracking. Is that green?﻿  Hydrogen is not the future, and hydrogen economy will never be. Hydrogen is abundant on Earth but not in the form you need it and you need to put in lots of energy to make it.  This is why Toyota is never talking about hydrogen price, and even giving it for free with vehicle, because when people realize that will cost 2-3 times more to fill it up than petrol car and 5-6 times more that electric car (for the same distance), nobody would event thing about buying it.  You can say, we will put solar panels, wind turbine or any other renewable and make hydrogen that way for 'free', but that also does not make sense, because with the same solar panels or wind turbines you can support 3-4 times more electric than hydrogen vehicles."

With 300kWh, electric car can do 900 miles. Is wasting 2/3 of energy green?   Most electricity is generated between 30%-45% efficiency, so 300 kWh of energy only generates say 100 kWh of electricity, take away 6.5% to deliver to the home, and 10% for battery charge/discharge.  You're left with ~85 kWH which drives a Tesla around 300 miles in good conditions.  So hydrogen is green compared to most grid power.  It's certainly not dirty at least.  Compared to solar panels it's still fairly green, because the 'battery' in a hydrogen storage system is very cheap compared to the battery needed to store the power in electricity so you can buy more generation to make up for some of the storage loss."
electricvehicles,32xryg,fauxgnaws,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:49:55 2015 UTC,"That is wrong comparison. I am comparing hydrogen and battery from the same starting point, electricity (which can be from any source and efficiency, coal, nuclear, hydro, solar...). You are taking into account electricity production only for the battery case, and not for hydrogen which needs it for electrolysis.  To make it fair, and you take electricity production into account for hydrogen, using the same numbers you used, than Mirai needs more than 900 kWh to fill up the tank.  Using hydrogen to store energy does not make much sense, because if you use 100kWh to create hydrogen and fill up the storage, you end up with 30kWh produced by fuel cell. That is wasting of 2/3 of the energy."
electricvehicles,32xryg,sasoon,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:55:01 2015 UTC,"Why would you compare starting from wall socket electricity?  That makes no sense.  Mass produced hydrogen would be generated directly from natural gas or other fuels at 80% efficiency using steam reforming, which is greener than charging a BEV on coal power.  Using electricity from renewables, DOE thinks high pressure electrolysis can get to 75% efficiency which includes the 3% cost of compression.  This is good, it just isn't ready yet to be installed in your utility room.  Hydrogen could even be generated directly from sunlight.  The reason to use hydrogen for storage is because it's cheap.  A $100 tank can store enough power for a home for a day vs a $6000 Li-Ion battery.  You could buy enough storage to power your home for a month for the price of one day's worth of battery, even at gigafactory promised prices.  That savings means a lot of extra solar panels, and it means a cloudy day -- or week -- is no problem.  I'm not going to bet on which technology is going to win out, but I do feel sad when people come up with straw men and make-believe numbers to make hydrogen look bad."

electricvehicles,32xryg,sasoon,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:26:21 2015 UTC,"Hydrogen economy:       The hydrogen economy is a proposed system of delivering energy using hydrogen. The term hydrogen economy was coined by John Bockris during a talk he gave in 1970 at General Motors (GM) Technical Center.  The concept was proposed earlier by geneticist J.B.S. Haldane.   Proponents of a hydrogen economy advocate hydrogen as a potential fuel for motive power  (including cars and boats) and on-board auxiliary power, stationary power generation (e.g., for the energy needs of buildings), and as an energy storage medium (e.g., for interconversion from excess electric power generated off-peak). Molecular hydrogen of the sort that can be used as a fuel does not occur naturally in convenient reservoirs; nonetheless it can be generated by steam reformation of hydrocarbons, water electrolysis or by other methods.

electricvehicles,32xryg,VicMG,9,Sat Apr 18 14:39:17 2015 UTC,"Ok, this article is BS, or Toyota hired some really dumb people.   However Toyota’s deputy chief engineer Yoshikazu Tanaka, who helped design the Japanese company’s hydrogen fuel cell car Mirai ...   Ok, one should stop reading that article now.   ... believes that improving charging technology will only result in energy being used at such a rate that it will reverse any good intent EV held as an environmentally-sound alternative.   What?  I know there are some charging inefficiencies, but ""at such a rate""?  And considering energy can come from green sources such as wind, hydro and solar, electric vehicles will always be more environmentally-sound.  And let's not even begin to talk about energy security, which is another massive benefit.   “If you were to charge a car in 12 minutes for a range of 500 km (310 miles), for example, you're probably using up electricity required to power 1,000 houses,” he explained during a presentation at the first test drive event for the Mirai production version. “That totally goes against the need to stabilize electricity use on the grid,” Tanaka added.   This is a problem with grid design, not electric cars.  Tesla already uses batteries to help lessen the load on the grid, this isn't news.  Out of all places, Japan has one of the largest CHAdeMO deployments, plus they also had a massive power infrastructure failure, yet they seem to be just fine with electric cars.  In fact, during the massive power grid failure in Japan, electric vehicles were the only ones still running around.  Some dealers were asked to provide more Nissan LEAFs because of this.   Currently lengthy charging times are driving potential customers away from market-available EV vehicles. For example, Nissan’s Leaf takes around eight hours to charge completely at a 200-volt charging point, which would give a driver approximately 84 miles of driving range.   Takes me 4 hours, and many newer vehicles are shipping with a 6.6kW charger.  Is the 6.6kW charger not a common option in Japan?  What about the fact that Japan is crowded with CHAdeMO chargers, so you could do 80% in 20 minutes.   “Toyota isn't denying the benefits of EVs […] But we think the best way to use them is to charge them at night (to avoid peak power consumption hours), and use them for short distances during the day,” said Tanaka.   But isn't that what most EV owners do?  Isn't that what we do with our smart phones, watches, drones, cameras  and other battery powered devices anyways? Then why bash BEVs (rhetorical, we know better)?   Toyota instead will continue to promote its hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) which it claims will promise the greenest alternative to conventional transportation due to their similar refuel speeds and driving range.   See how he said conventional transportation, and not battery electric vehicles ;)  As for range, Tesla, the next gen LEAF, Chevy Bolt, ...) are making that a moot point.   Although these cars will require great investment, Tanaka argued that in the long-term hydrogen will be the preferred option thanks to its portability, abundancy and storability compared to electricity.   Portable as in requiring you to haul your own refinery around, while also requiring access to infrastructure which doesn't even exist yet.  Electrical outlets on the other hand, can be found in so many places, you could even go to a gasoline station, and charge there!    “Of course, there are technological hurdles that need to be cleared to make this commercially viable,” concluded Tanaka. “But remember 'Back to the Future'? In that movie, a car from 30 years in the future comes back to the present — the year 1985 […] The Mirai doesn't fly, but this year, 2015, is that future.”   The Mirai is about as practical as that BTTF hoverboard, couldn't have picked a better movie!  Electric cars have been around since the 1900's, and the very primitive grid seemed to handle it ok.  I'm probably biased towards battery powered vehicles, and don't have a reason to 'hate' fuel cell vehicles (I'm sure they will have their advantages, maybe cargo and passenger hauling), but Toyota's negative attitude really makes me wonder what they are thinking.  Why bother developing a new version of the Prius Plug-in if it's that bad of an investment?  I look forward to the day when Toyota announces it's developing a BEV again, and watch them flip sides again.  I actually had to do a quick search to see if thestack.com had any relationship with Toyota, this was pretty bad."

His numbers are off by a factor of four, but this is still equivalent to adding another 250 houses to the grid.  Clean energy sources dont adapt to load well, so you need to support this load with something like coal, or by storing grid energy.  Storing the grid has its own problems, and electric vehicles become much less efficient if you have to have an equally-sized battery everywhere you want to charge up.  By my estimation, still more efficient than gasoline, but maybe not better than greenly-produced hydrogen."

Ofcourse car moving and car moving with 1MW are totally different things.  Apparently they got atleast a car body together. The total lack of technical details is worrying. They should already know the batterys energy capacity. Is it going to be one speed or does it have transmission. What motors and what controllers, there isn't exactly that many manufacturer for those and motors and controllers is not something you by yourself, unless you have lots of engineers or dedicate lots of time in it.  Also ""revolutionary new thing""? On electronic cars it's either in-wheel-motors or new battery chemistry. Considering they talk about being really expensive, probably chemistry. In wheel motors are not expensive, just harder to design. Maybe they are using the titanate batteries ERA uses, which allow faster charging. Though that would not be revolutionary, Though neither would in-wheel motors be. You can also ready by both of those off-the-shelf from manufacturers.  Though battery swapping plans would imply, that they haven't fixed anything revolutionary. You can talk about revolutionary electric vehicle, when you do 24 hours of Le Mans without battery swaps.

Sadly the database gives absolutely no info outside of the fact that Toroidion OY has filed the applications.  edit: And their website has more info now. Based on the drivetrain mock up image it is not an in-wheel motor design. It is 4 motor AWD design with direct drivetrain to the wheel. Based on their website the their main ""new"" thing is fast battery swapping, which is not new at all. High performance light weight batteries might mean they use lithium titanate, that ERA used."
electricvehicles,32srqm,variaati0,2,Thu Apr 16 15:37:23 2015 UTC,"Pasi Pennanen, the guy behind Toroidion is a car designer, with a history @ Jaguar & Honda. He has also been designing military vehicles for Sisu Defence. Thus, he's a rather visually oriented guy - which is visible in the 1MW design. From that perspective, it's hard to speculate what kind of patented innovations they've come up with. The quick swap battery is one thing (IMHO the front design supports this idea), but working some chemical breakthroughs is an entirely different one.  This being said, Toroidion has emphasized, that they're an ""electric-car technology""-focused company. Pennanen has actually said himself, that it's not the ""main target"" for them to get MW1 into production, it's rather a proof-of-concept (-concept) for them to ahow their innovations work. Licencing that tech for other electric car manufacturers is as important (if not even more) for Toroidion."
electricvehicles,32srqm,variaati0,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"So they designed a 1MW car, just to get in the headlines with the ""1MW""  marker. Well their old company was partly a marketing agency. :)  Well that makes sense now. They are certainly not capable of new battery design, because for that they would need an university level applied chemistry and physics lab. The drivetrain mock up design is pretty standard looking for current 4 motor setup, so that is not marketable alone. This means they have designed a new quick action battery pack holding, locking and releasing latches and are trying to sell that. Probably also a related  swapping station and battery pack design.  This is pure speculation. Based on the single drivetrain mock up image http://www.toroidion.com/launch/assets/img/Toroidion_1MW_proto_002.jpg . I think it is drop down and roll over battery swap. The battery runs the narrow for the whole length of the body in the middle like a drive shafts, which leaves it free from front and back obstacles, mainly the wheels and pretty humongous looking motor units.  You roll to pit stop. There is a battery waiting on the end of the swap point. At the start of the swap point the old pack is dropped from the car by the car releasing locks holding the pack. Because its a narrow pack, you can roll away from it without rear tires running over the pack. Usually bottom packs are full wide. Maybe they raise suspension or drop the pack to a deeper bay to clear the front and back fenders. Probably suspension raise, because race tracks probably don't like you destroying their pitlane by digging holes in them.  You roll away from the old pack sitting on the pitlane and roll over to the charged pack. Again wheels are not in the way and the car is riding high. Then you just lower the suspension, which will drop the car on the new battery pack. There is quick lock latches, that lock the  pack in place underneath the car and you just drive away. Maybe the suspension goes extra low for a second to allow the mating. Pack is tapered in front and pack top side, which would support design choice to allow for some margin or error and mechanical guiding to the exact point of contact.  There must be a secondary auxiliary mini pack to keep lights on and wheels rotating during the swap.   There is one main hickup I see. That packs protective shell must be armored up to the hilt, because it is directly exposed to hits from below and specially in the front. The pack is up to the front and gets no protection from the car itself, so it must be able to take high speed road debree on its own."

At top gear they're transmitting power at around 1 to 1, maybe up to 8 or 9k rpm.  An electric motor usually has a reduction gearbox attached to maximize torque. These motors have a max speed of somewhere around 20-25k rpm, sometimes more.

It'll travel for up to 39 miles on electric mode alone, but with the generator spooled up will go up to 330 miles before needing to stop.   Still underwhelming for the asking price. Might as well kept the original price and upped the electric range to 100 miles and 400 or even 500 miles total with the ICE generator.

If you can, take advantage of the current very generous income tax rebate.  I expect that will still go away after July 1.  After July 1, I don't imagine a Leaf being economical, when driven minimally, if the current bill is signed as is.  I greatly hope that they axe (or substantially reduce) the ""EV penalty"" in HB 170.  EV owners are already subject to a $35 ""annual highway user fee"" that non-AFV vehicles don't have to pay (http://law.onecle.com/georgia/40/40-2-76.html). [This website quotes $25, but I was charged $35 just today to renew my registration in Gwinnett.]  So, it would be a annual $235 ""fee"" to renew EV registration, if the bill stands.  I need to find the link, but someone here recently posted some detailed statistics that $200 would cover the gas taxes of 20K+ miles on a gas guzzling SUV (Chevy Tahoe size).  Pretty crazy to penalize EV owners to the tune of $200, regardless of actual miles driven and vehicle weight - the two most important factors in actual road wear.  To answer your question, I would suggest you buy/lease now, while the $5K incentive is still active.  After we see how HB 170 shakes out, longer-term advice can be given."

To separate these things only for EVs is to let them rape you raw.    Don't accuse me of not wanting to pay my fair share.  Lower emissions and more flexible fuel benefits everybody. (Electricity can come from anything and is getting lower emissions all the time everywhere and EVs practically create zero added emissions when charged at night from idling-speed large central generators.)  Why no credit for that?    Fossil fuel should be penalized.  In a simple and cheaply-executed way.  Likewise the money should be plowed back into the economy, broadly as possible.  In a cheaply-executed way.  (Pick one: 10 year payroll tax holiday, monthly stewardship checks to everyone, whatever's cheap to do and broad across the entire economy, equal as possible to as many people as possible.)  You can't calculate your carbon footprint without a price on carbon.  When you have one, you don't have to calculate your carbon footprint.  Like magic.  An invisible hand.  With a carbon price, the answer to the incessant question ""Are EVs really lower carbon?"" doesn't ever have to be discussed by thinking people.  With a carbon price, the answer is evident in the bottom line.    Until the background unfairness is corrected, don't accuse me of not seeing the unfairness.  We were subsidizing the pollution of folks with Hummers a month ago and today we are subsidizing them moreso.  THAT'S unfair.  How about they pay for their impact?  This is simple.

electricvehicles,324au3,eleitl,3,Fri Apr 10 14:17:05 2015 UTC,"In just 15 years?    Yes.  I did the calculations, and if storage continues the way it has, you're going to get EVs that can drive a full day before needing to recharge.  Let's look at current battery technology.  If you were able to replace a Tesla's 85kWh battery pack with a LiS pack of equivalent mass, you'd get more than 12 straight hours of driving before you needed a recharge.  Basically, the only reason that's not being done currently is that it would cost almost $64k just for the battery, as opposed to the ~$21k a Tesla pack currently costs.  If the 16% per year holds, in 7 years, that 255kWh pack would only be $18k.  If it instead continues at the 14% per year, it'd cost $22k.  Either way, even without anything other than battery cost improvements, 2022 will have 850 mile battery packs in the car.  In 15 years?  Even if it's only 10% cost improvement per year on average, it'd only be $13k for a 850 mile battery pack.  That's only about twice the cost of a Leaf battery pack currently.  You think people wouldn't pay an extra $7k for 850 miles of range?  No problem! They can buy the 400 mile pack for the current $6k.    Alternately, if you put the LiS in a range extending trailer, you could make them rentals, so that when you needed to drive for a full day without stopping.  Then, you could charge it overnight, or possibly even swap it out at the local uDrive place.  And then, when you get to your destination, you could drop the trailer off at the uDrive place, and still have a full battery.  Seriously, for any consumer vehicle, the technology already exists to do this, the only real problem is that of production volume/cost.  15 years?  That's a conservative estimate for the technology, and that's even if the only improvement is cost/production volume."

Diesel durability is measured in lightseconds.   That's only about twice the cost of a Leaf battery pack currently   The Leaf battery pack costs 6.1 kEUR. That's fuel costs for a decade at our current type of driving.  What would be good is a 10-15 kEUR Honda Fit-like car with ~500 km range, rechargable within an hour, with the same durability as an ICE (about a lightsecond). Because this is what it would take to make ICEs obsolete. Do you think we can get that in 15 years?"

That energy is cleaner and more abundant than the cleanest fossil fuels, and has negligible environmental impact (including less environmental radiation than Coal).  And that's not even taking into account the Thorium reactors that Norway, China, and India are trying.  Plus, that's just Nuclear.  We've made a number of promising developments in Solar, Wind, and Tidal/Wave power.  Transportation?  Only a problem if you insist on defending old technologies, as you seem to.  Don't get me wrong, in the war between Diesel and Petrol powered vehicles, diesel is the only rational choice.  On the other hand, however, with battery technology advancing the way it is, defending Diesel over electric (either BEV or Fuel Cell) is silly.

Honestly, if those batteries can be made to hold the capacity of curren Li-ion batteries with even a 20% decrease in the other measurements, at the price that Aluminum can be purchased relative to Lithium, they'd switch over as soon as production could meet demand.  Because the cost savings is inherent to the material not to the design."
electricvehicles,31zcf6,MuaddibMcFly,3,Thu Apr 9 18:02:05 2015 UTC,"The cost savings inevitably require efficiencies of scale. Efficiencies of scale are what make the cost trend towards the material cost.   But those efficiencies of scale come with a relatively massive engineering cost in both time and money. Not only do you have to develop the manufacturing process, you've got to develop the machines which enable that manufacturing process. And in some cases you develop the manufacturing process for those machines.  What ""virtually overnight"" means is fairly ambiguous, but I think we can agree that time spent in ramping up manufacturing for a wholly or mostly-new technology will be non-trivial."
electricvehicles,31zcf6,atrain728,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:12:29 2015 UTC,"Efficiencies of scale are what make the cost trend towards the material cost.    And the fact that in 2012, the world produced over 1,200 times more aluminum than lithium means that there are efficiencies of scale already in place for aluminum that still do not exist for lithium.  Given that aluminum is literally 4000x more abundant in the crust than lithium, those economies of scale likely cannot exist for lithium.  And on the manufacturing side of things, I have a hard time believing that converting Lithium based battery manufacturing to Aluminum based would take as much effort as starting from scratch, especially given that aluminum is such a relatively benign element."

However, that won't be the case in a few years. In the next ten years or so, 40A or 10 kW L2 charging will be the norm in order to fill a 50 kWh to 85 kWh battery pack overnight. Higher end battery packs will need 60-80A charging to fill overnight.  2) Whatever you install should last a long time - the cost of the copper and the labor is high, so you don't want to do it more than necessary.  3) Burying conduit that allows you to alter the wiring after 10 years or so is probably a good idea.  Therefore, 3 x 60A makes a lot of sense. You can finish it off with NEMA 14-50's which is cheap, but not really rated for a lot of connects and disconnects and not really designed for outdoor use all the time but you can use outdoor enclosures. You can also buy the Clipper Creek 48A J1772 for $899 which will future proof L2 charging for quite some time."

I'm very happy with the performance of my Volt, although I do keep it in sport mode 100% of the time.  What makes a Model S impractical for me is that I make a regular 500+ mile trip, one or two per month.  When I'm in either of the two cities I live in, I would like the range of a Leaf, but I need the range of an ICE car when I'm traveling between.  GM blew it with the ELR.

I know that Eric Kriss of Kriss Motors does not have significant cooling on the AC-50 in his Sonett II, which has about a curb weight around 700kg.  Well, other than a glorified aluminum plate under the controller acting as a heat sink.    For best efficiency, though, you'll note that HPEVS (the maker of the motors I've been talking about) cite data for ""Continuous"" power with both Sealed and Fan Cooled motors.  Maybe you could ask them?  Or possibly some of the folks in your neck of the woods who've done this sort of thing.  After all, we who do this sort of conversion are generally amateurs, who're happy to help others who're doing something we're so interested in (see: my responses).  All that said, my understanding is, basically, since you're in the UK, so long as you're not running this thing in the depth of winter, you should be fine with nothing more than a chill plate for the controllers and maybe a fan on the motor & chill plate.  Seems that British weather (like that of my home of the Pacific Northwest) is pretty easy on the entire EV drivetrain; not too cold, nor too hot, for batteries, motor, nor controller."

Regards to where you can buy a motor your location would be good as well as a price range.  As it's a kit car, I presume it's just a running shell with no engine at all, so you're missing a gear box, a drive plate etc. That would all need to be fabricated (I know most electric cars don't have gears in a traditional sense, but there usually is some geared ratio)."
electricvehicles,31i9bk,redonculous,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:39:49 2015 UTC,"A lot of EV conversions utilize a manual gearbox. You can leave it in 3rd gear and not take it out of gear when you start and stop. But you can also shift to get more excitement, or more efficiency.   Also DC EVs don't appear to be the way to go anymore. Regenerative breaking is a big bonus.

Tesla is challenging the law in many states, as they will continue to do, and has won some and has lost some.  Related to the article: This is really just the case of a financially biased lawmaker throwing out headline worthy quotes and stories that the average driver can relate to.

It's a private company and they could tell the guy not to charge or even come onto their property if they wanted to.

At night, most of the electricity production will be nuclear, hydroelectric, and wind with a much smaller percentage of natural gas since the demand at that time will be far lower.  In any case, the Mirai will get most of its hydrogen from processing natural gas. Matter of fact, the Well to Wheels (WtW) comparison is worse for a FCEV than a BEV when both start with the same 100% natural gas. It doesn't help that FCEV's have to the gas compressed to very high pressures using electricity to achieve the energy densities required for the claimed range.

The ""end of lease questions"" options just gets you a useless recorded FAQ.    They send you a contract to extend the lease and you mail it back.  The price is what you've paid monthly before, no negotiations.  I'm several thousand miles under my limit, so I don't know what the details on mileage are.    I was debating between the 2 and 3 year leases, and ended up saving quite a bit of money by picking the cheaper 2 year.  The reason I leased my first car ever with this Leaf is because I kind of expected the resale value to be bad.  The only way people are going to want old Leafs is if gas spikes over $5/gallon.  That gives you an advantage because they don't really want the car back.    The reason I haven't signed that new lease contract is because a guy at the dealership says he can get me a 2014 Leaf SV, with no money down, and the same $300/month payment.  If he can find me a car, I'll do that, but he hasn't come through.    One of the reasons I picked the SV over the SL in 2013 is because I liked the simpler wheels a lot more.  For 2015, trying to hook us up, Nissan moved the goofy looking wheels down to the SL.  A car as strange looking as the Leaf needs nice plain wheels."

Some of the 'caveats' should be non-starters. For example, emergency situations. That's a big fat hairy deal, and would be a deal breaker for me out of the gate. I can't imagine the anxiety I would feel if my wife needed my immediate attention and I couldn't make it to her, and if I had kids...   I thought long and hard about my Leaf before purchase, ran through our typical vehicle usage and mileage. I decided to pull the trigger because my city is only 30 miles across, so the emergency consideration, and just about any other scenario, figures out for me. My commute is 30 miles round trip, no highway. There's literally nowhere I can't go in my metro area where I can't get back home, or anywhere else in town and then back home. I've never come close to turtle mode.  Additionally, relying on public charging infrastructure is going to be a bad idea for a long time to come. It was 2 years ago, and it is now too. I know people get excited about it, but the reality is, as you said, it's 20 minutes even on a rapid charger at best, and not all EVs are even compatible with that. If charging at home isn't going to fit the bill, an EV probably isn't for you. The gas station paradigm is probably not going to happen in our lifetimes. More likely will be widely available parking lot charging.  The current paradigm has one use the EV during waking hours, and charging during sleeping hours using a level 2 charger. It's the only way it makes sense to operate an EV with limited range right now. It's going to be a long, long time before chargers are in every parking lot.  Of course, you have to remember to charge it. I have forgotten too, and that's something I considered as well (I'm awfully forgetful sometimes), but I can make my commute 3 times without charging, so the impact is negligible.  The reality is that the low range EV isn't for everyone. It certainly doesn't fit your lifestyle well. A Tesla would likely work as a commuter for you, but not many people have that kind of scratch for a commuter car. I think you might have jumped the gun on an all electric for your lifestyle.

I didn't find the car swapping to be all that strange, but the Fan Boost really struck me as odd. Fan favorites get the capability to use more power for a short period of time. So what happens when the guy always in first keeps getting the Fan Boost? Sounds like it's got some potential for abuse or as an unfair advantage.  And on the other side of that, drivers are basically prohibited from taking full advantage of the full power of the vehicle, which seems a bit silly. F1 racers aren't told they can only use 75% of the available power of their cars. I know that the FIA has all sorts of restrictions on F1, but you can use all of the car you build provided it fits the specs.

It could be considered an awareness campaign to those who would pay no heed to the range warnings and get themselves stranded.   ...“range requirement” is largely a mental construct that people have formed in their heads rather than a practical need...   The 200 mile range is not an arbitrarily selected value.  It intentionally exceeds the range of the average driver by a large amount with reason.  Furthermore, it's less about range and more about neglect.  Elon's goal is to appease THAT market (read: the other choir). The market of ICE dependents, neglectful/wasteful people, and EV skeptics who are already poisoned with EV range hype -- which has existed long before Elon got into EVs -- and likely exacerbated by Elon's obvious marketing campaign to denounce EV range for his benefit.  If you are worried about bottom-line EVs becoming too expensive due to this standard range argument, keep in mind that an increase in demand for lithium mining and refining operations in North America will tap an untapped market.  It's a highly isolated market with very little competition.  If the EV market penetrates the every-driver market even by a small margin we will see the battery market change drastically."
electricvehicles,30t99v,totemcatcher,2,Mon Mar 30 20:38:37 2015 UTC,"Besides, I don't think this anti-EV range propaganda necesarily restricts the proliferation of EVs in the public mind.    No, but it does make a lie of his claim that he wants to facilitate the transition from ICE to EV; by insisting that a car with enough range for 90% of the population ""doesn't work"" for them, despite evidence to the contrary, he boosts the car-sales of effective competitors to the Leaf/i3 by a number equal to the people who listen to him.   The 200 mile range is not an arbitrarily selected value. It intentionally exceeds the range of the average driver by a large amount with reason   ...neither was 80 miles arbitrary.  80 miles of range is twice the daily range of 2/3 of the population, and 3 times the range of half of them.  If you take the 100 miles that some drivers are reporting, that's 4 times the median driver's range requirements.  But no, 200 isn't arbitrary, it's a nice round number that Tesla's vehicles meet/exceed, and their competitors won't meet for a while.  The eGolf, i3, and Leaf all hit 80-100 miles, so saying the first round number (100) wouldn't work.  The next logical round, satisfying number is 150, but there's pretty good probability that BMW, VWGroup, and Nissan will hit or exceed that by the time the Model 3 comes to market.  So, no, it isn't arbitrary, it's designed to make the vehicles that are direct competitors to the (currently purely theoretical) look non-viable.  Which, as you said, is perfectly sound business practice... but, again, it proves the lie of the ""other EVs aren't our competition"" claim Elon made when Tesla opened their patent portfolio."

These kind of assumptions are going to put you at odds with Elon Musk's logic. He wants to create consumer EVs that can replace all functions of ICEs, and not some weak implementation that needs an ICE as backup for long trips or heavy loads.  That's the problem with designing an EV that has only 100 miles of range - it may be all that a lot of people need for their average use, but then it becomes something that can't be used for long trips.  And then on average use, you're cycling the batteries more (or cycling them deeper) which is going to shorten the life of your batteries.   I think there’s little debate that Tesla took the best approach to EVs, but Renault-Nissan certainly seems to have a legitimate interest in leading the way in this market, and by some standards it is doing so.   Yeah, and that's great, but it seems like they aren't really trying to engineer a great vehicle. The LEAF has a poor choice of battery chemistry, and no thermal control system - I mean, you must know about the class-action lawsuit related to this. I would hardly call putting out a half-assed EV with major design flaws to be ""leading the way"", more like threatening the viability of the industry by not doing your homework and rushing out a vehicle (or knowingly skimping on critical components) - either way, not good."

He wants to create consumer EVs that can replace all functions of ICEs, and not some weak implementation that needs an ICE as backup for long trips or heavy loads.   And one of the biggest barriers to such a thing is a decent charging infrastructure.  That's what Nissan realized, and why they put CHAdeMO chargers in at their dealerships: they recognized the Chicken-and-Egg/Catch-22 of Fast-Charger Vehicles/Fast-Charger Stations, and are trying to supply both.   In order to achieve full market penetration, replacing ICEs as the standard, you need to create demand for both.  Despite the fact that SAE-Combo/CSS has been a codified standard for pushing 3 years now, there is apparently one, and only one such plug in all of NYC, supporting its millions of people.  That's not viable if you want to extend range.  Hell, even if it operates at the maximum of 90kW, that's still going to take what will be perceived as ""an unacceptably long time"" to put 200+ miles of charge onto your 250 mile vehicle (somewhere around 45 minutes. Per Vehicle).  On the other hand, if you focus on the charging network, you can build lots of chargers at half the maximum CSS throughput, and you'll have the infrastructure to upgrade range as you go.  Say, for example, battery tech makes a enormous leap, jumping from 25kWh for the size/weight/cost that's viable in a Leaf, to 200kWh.  It's not going to happen, but bear with me, here.   Now, you have a vehicle that can have 2, maybe even 3, charging ports.  Those same 68 kWh of power you need to go 200 miles now represents now is only 1/3 the capacity, not 4/5, so it will charge much faster.  Plug in 2 chargers @ 45kW, and the low resistance will allow for charging at, what, less than 30 minutes?  Or, if they're full 90kWh chargers, you could be out of there in 15 minutes.  No, the battery tech is coming, but by spouting such blatantly false propaganda, Musk is actually delaying the viable replacement of the ICEs he claims are his real adversaries.   Yeah, and that's great, but it seems like they aren't really trying to engineer a great vehicle.   No, they're not trying to engineer a perfect vehicle.  They have engineered a great vehicle, one that, dollar for dollar, is better than what Tesla is producing, and in viable numbers.  Is a Nissan Leaf better than a Tesla?  No way.  Is a fully loaded Nissan Leaf better than 1/3 of a Tesla (the approximate cost)?  Given that the average family can afford the one, and not the other, I'm going to say ""Yes"""
electricvehicles,30t99v,MuaddibMcFly,4,Wed Apr 1 20:24:53 2015 UTC,The data is missing a huge important piece of information: Most trips are round trips.  So the 50 miles is really 100 miles.  DC to Baltimore in a Leaf without charging is not really safe range wise.  100 miles is not enough though 150 miles might be.

You can't own a leaf (as a sole vehicle) if one in twenty of your trips won't work with it. Get that 200 miles with a charging network and the problem basically goes away.
electricvehicles,30t99v,cryptoanarchy,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:00:07 2015 UTC,Well I think >99% of people would exceed the range of the leaf on an ICE if you're considering the whole lifetime of the vehicle. But the graph does show those occasions are rare.
electricvehicles,30t99v,darkmighty,6,Tue Mar 31 19:10:14 2015 UTC,I don't agree with Musk. There's room in the market for all sorts of different ranges. A 2 car family could quite happily own a EV that's only capable of 100 miles.

My family needs 2 cars since both my wife and I work. We only need 1 for long trips (ICE SUV), while the other is just used for commuting (i3). If we were to go all EV, it would be far more economical to own say a Tesla for long range trips, and a 80-100 mile EV for commuting; rather than 2 Teslas. Then again, I'd love 2 Teslas. :p  But to the author's point, there is room and use for low range EVs in the market."

We brought it in to Tesla a few weeks ago and poured some water on one door (to demonstrate) - it froze so hard that the window didn't even try to move (we've never seen it that frozen solid before).

The car sat for only like 40 minutes max in the sun at 17o F after dumping a small bucket of water on it before we drove it in (walked a dog before leaving). The damn thing practically froze while we were driving."
electricvehicles,30t99v,ACDRetirementHome,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:21:18 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, but it meets the requirements of what it's needed for. I don't agree that ""“Anything below 200 miles isn’t passing grade"", it depends on how it's used.  Some people will consider a 200 mile range to be wholly inadequate, and others could live with a 50 mile range. I don't think there are any rigid criteria."
electricvehicles,30t99v,Muck777,3,Mon Mar 30 20:54:40 2015 UTC,"For a lot people, the difference between a range of less than 100 miles and more than 200 miles in an EV is the difference between having an EV as a second car to commute to work and a primary or only car that you can do everything with.  With a 200 mile range car, I can take a day trip or forget to charge for a night or two in a row.  That extra range lets people be people.  With a short range car, even if its perfect for 90% of driving, there's still that 10% that you need access to a second vehicle.  Extending the range drops that 10% to something like 1 or 2%.  For example, let's say you drive 120 miles round trip once a month, and take a 600 mile road trip for a week (300 each way) once a year.  With a shorter range vehicle, there's question about whether you'll be able to make that once a month trip, and that long trip isn't even an option.  But if the car has a 200 mile range, not only is the shorter trip within your safety zone, but the longer trip is conceivable with some good planning and rapid charging.  If not feasible, then the need for another vehicle drops to one week of a rental car, which is much cheaper than keeping and maintaining a second car."

I'm sure everyone will want the higher range regardless of whether or not they actually need it.

It isn't fair to say that all EVs that don't do what Model S does are junk when Model S costs far beyond what the majority of people can pay for a car.  Leaf has proven itself to be a fantastic car for thousands of people. Would we rather them just stick with ICE's until there is a $30,000, 200+ mile EV?  If Model 3 can be truly be 200+ miles for $35,000, then that's great. But then I will wonder if they could make a Model Y (because S3XY) that had half the battery/range and cost maybe $20,000. I think that would be the EV that would really sell."
electricvehicles,30t99v,MrTizl,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:25:06 2015 UTC,"To be frank: Yes, they are effectively junk. Not only do they just have less range overall to make trips, but will have more and more of their battery used for daily commutes. When an EV has to be charged to 100% then almost flatlined to make a trip, that hurts the viability of the battery because those acts can damage a battery when done repeatedly.  Teslas can last longer not only because they just have more batteries, but because you are less like to charge to the brim then get to 1%."

Which is extremely limiting in many urban areas. For example, Irvine to Dodger stadium is 45 miles. San Jose, CA to AT&T park is 55 miles. Alexandria, VA to Camden Yards is 45 miles. Plano, TX is 40 miles from Globe Life Park in Arlington.  Those aren't 3-day weekends or short vacations I'm describing. Those are trips to baseball games--your buddy calls you at work, says he has an extra ticket to the game and asks you to meet him there. In an ICE or a Tesla, those are trips you don't think twice about. In a Leaf, you get invited to a Giants, Dodgers, Rangers, or Orioles game, you have to figure out where charging stations are, hope they aren't occupied/broken, and hope they aren't a long walk/Uber to the baseball stadium."

electricvehicles,30qxfo,BraveRock,2,Mon Mar 30 11:48:31 2015 UTC,Here's a review from someone: http://slickdeals.net/forums/showpost.php?p=75140847&postcount=10
electricvehicles,30qxfo,ThatOneGuyDotNet,2,Mon Mar 30 16:01:22 2015 UTC,"I have a juicebox and like it. I would like the mounting bracket (they weren't included when I got mine a few months back) but for $30 + ship I figure it's better to whip something up myself.  I guess if you were going camping and had an RV site and the right adapter, it may be nice to have this with you depending on your car. I have a Fusion Energi and only get 20mi avg on a full charge, not worth lugging this around for that IMHO. Though I didn't look at pure EVs because I didn't want to have to worry about things like that.   I'm not sure I would call it ""portable"", by the time you add the cable it's quite bulky. I have the 25ft, 50 or 60A cable because they were out of the 30A cable when I ordered it so I paid a bit more (but not full price) for the larger cable, and that cable is pretty thick and not very flexible, I don't know what the 30A cable is like though."
electricvehicles,30kcgf,ThisSNisforwork,10,Sat Mar 28 03:02:36 2015 UTC,"Incentives:  The federal $7,500 tax credit will only benefit you if you pay more than that in taxes each year. The state $2,500 (in state's like California) is a rebate. You get it back in a check after you apply for it.  You mention maintenance. There's another incentive: there is none. Rotate your tires, change your air filter, check brake fluid, and really there's nothing else aside from battery coolant (if your battery has that sort of thing) at ~100k miles.   Lease vs. Buy  If you lease, you won't have access to the federal tax credit, but chances are the place leasing you the car will take that off the price of the car to meet the residual, but it's not a given. In CA, to receive the rebate, you have to be in possession of the car for 3 full years or else they might come after you for some or all of the rebate amount. Most leases meet this, but if you do a 2 year lease, that rebate is unavailable to you. Also, driving ~60 miles a day 5 days a week is a pretty heavy commute. 60 miles x 5 days x 50 weeks = 15,000 miles a year, which for some leases is the absolute limit for a reasonable price. Be sure you include an honest estimate of your driving in your plans. If you do any weekend driving you're gonna exceed that 15k pretty easily.  Buying is a tenuous option right now. 200 mile range EVs are promised right around the corner from Chevy and Nissan. Tesla's Model E is supposed to be a new affordable option too.  Income  Able to afford a $100k car? Get a Tesla. They've even got a pseudo-lease program where they guarantee to buy the car back after 3 years for 2/3rds of the price you paid.   Want a pure EV but can only afford 30k-40k? The Nissan Leaf, Chevy Spark EV, Ford Focus Electric, and Fiat 500e are the ones to look at. The Mitsubishi i-MiEV is a little short on range for your commute.  Plug in hybrids is also an option. In California, there is a limited number of green carpool stickers for hybrids and plug-in hybrids, and they've recently increased that number to 70,000 with 60,000 having already been issued (As of Feb 2015). Ford C-Max Energi, Fusion Energi, Toyota Prius Plug-in, and Chevy Volt all meet that. Generally they're a little more expensive than a pure EV or a regular ICE, but you get to have some of your commute on full battery power, and then still have the range to make long trips if you need.  Here's a list of cars to look at and decide which might be best for you. http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/carpool/carpool.htm"
electricvehicles,30kcgf,Lonelan,4,Sat Mar 28 03:38:54 2015 UTC,"Had an ffe.  If it's ever cold or you run the ac,  you're gonna need to charge to make 60 miles some days."
electricvehicles,30kcgf,goofygrin,1 point,Sat Mar 28 03:49:17 2015 UTC,"Just curious, what range did you get on the coldest winter days?  I was estimating that it would be about 76 * 0.7 = 53.2 miles.  Of course, if the battery has degraded for about a year, it's probably closer to 76 * 0.7 * 0.9 = 47.9 miles.    I actually need about 50 miles range but I'd prefer to have a bigger buffer.    Unfortunately the 70-80 mile BEV is probably the result of the CARB requirement that EVs get 100 miles unadjusted range to get 3 ZEV credits.  If they had required 120 or 130 miles unadjusted range, then we might all be driving true 100 mile BEVs today."

The warranty policy has been changed. Other owners have said the first year service has been kind of a waste of money (along the lines of ""I was in and out in 30 minutes"") since you don't really need to change the rotors (probably the most expensive part of the service) every 12k miles.

The only Kia dealerships that I know of that have them are either in Southern California or the San Francisco area. I live in sacramento and had mine delivered to my house from Concord.
electricvehicles,30kcgf,ACDRetirementHome,3,Fri Apr 17 01:52:22 2015 UTC,Imo leasing an ev is always the way to go.  You get the rebates up front (no waiting for tax time or worrying if you qualify) and most have artificially high residuals and low money factors.   Or swap a lease one (what I did) and get into one for a shorter term and potentially more discounts.
electricvehicles,30kcgf,OompaOrangeFace,2,Sat Mar 28 03:18:15 2015 UTC,"I see the main reason for leasing is the rapid development of EV battery technology. Also, the knowledge that fully charging and discharging the battery leads to faster degradation - if you lease you can always charge to 100% and not worry about degradation because you wash your hands of the car after 3 years."
electricvehicles,30kcgf,motley2,1 point,Sat Mar 28 05:39:52 2015 UTC,I wouldn't buy an EV other than a Tesla today. All of these compliance cars will be practically worthless in 3-5 years.

If you have a 60 mile commute, I would not consider any of the current pure EVs except a Tesla Model s.    Assuming that you can't afford a Model S, I would wait for the 2nd generation Volt.   It will have an EPA rated range of 50 miles.  That means that you'll probably get around 60 miles AER in moderate weather (40F to 74F).  In the very coldest winter days (think Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin) you'll probably get around 40 miles AER."

Similar to racing, towing places the entire drivetrain under a higher level of stress than would be seen in normal driving.  I don't know of any full EVs that are rated for towing. The Chevrolet Volt, Tesla Model S, and perhaps Nissan e-NV200 are perhaps the closest to full power EVs that might be expected to have a tow rating, but none do. The Model X may be the first tow-capable EV.  Some mild plug-in hybrids are rated for towing. These will lean primarily on the gas engine for towing power, and the electric motor will provide assistance for accelerating from a stop.  The UK Outlander PHEV is rated at 1500 kg towing capacity, braked.  The Porsche Cayenne e-Hybrid is rated at 3500 kg towing capacity, braked."
electricvehicles,30j0gg,protomech,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:23:07 2015 UTC,"neat, though I imagine model x will be targeted at the small SUV crowd, like porsche and bmw, and it's towing capacity, if any, will be as limited by the chassis as the drive train..."
electricvehicles,30j0gg,protomech,2,Sat Mar 28 00:23:48 2015 UTC,Yes. It'll probably be similar to other CUVs: not a threat to real trucks.
electricvehicles,30j0gg,dogphlap,2,Sat Mar 28 07:14:36 2015 UTC,"The Tesla Model X (due out in 3rd quarter of 2015 but it is already 2 years overdue plus there is a huge waiting list already and it will be around $100,000) will have provision for a tow hitch. This will not be what I'd call a small car with a weight of 2 tons plus and massive torque so it might make a good tow vehicle if the aluminium chassis is strong enough to support towing your trailer (that is a big if)."

electricvehicles,30j0gg,paulwesterberg,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:16:48 2015 UTC,"eh, it already is. I just figured with VIA retrofitting newer work trucks and claiming 100mpg (though no where near the stock towing capacity), it might be entering the realm of possibility to hack together something similar and do slightly better than the under 10 mpg I get now, while laying the foundation for an all-electric system for if it ever becomes a practical option."
electricvehicles,30j0gg,paulwesterberg,2,Fri Mar 27 20:52:39 2015 UTC,There is no way that via trucks get 100mpg without using the same sketchy volt-math that they used when they announced that the volt gets 230mpg. They just ignore the energy provided by electricity.  There is a reason why GM used a direct mechanical linkage to power the volt at highway speed. Converting fuel to motion to electricity to motion. Every conversion of energy is lossy and inefficient. Plug-ins can save gas as long as range extenders are only rarely used.
electricvehicles,30j0gg,Zymosis,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:07:54 2015 UTC,"ah, fair enough. guess fossil-fuel burners will still be moving things around for us a bit longer than I imagined."
electricvehicles,30j0gg,protomech,2,Fri Mar 27 23:01:51 2015 UTC,"Via trucks could get as much as 50-55mpge - which would still be fantastic.  Wrightspeed is currently working on electrified plug-in delivery trucks with small tubines for backup that get around 45mpge.   I think that once these companies can put something in mass production, with batteries prices at $150/kWh you will see a lot of local fleet vehicles quickly switch to electric because operating and maintenance costs will be so much lower."
electricvehicles,30j0gg,diesel_stinks_,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:35:06 2015 UTC,"ah... so it's just not at all DIY-able? it really doesn't look excessively complex, just geared towards frequent short trips, rather than dedicated towing."
electricvehicles,30j0gg,diesel_stinks_,2,Sat Mar 28 00:00:40 2015 UTC,"There have been DIY electric truck conversions, but the range is usually really low due to the cost of a large battery pack needed for decent range. A range extender could be done easily by putting a genset in the back or under the hood but it would have to be big to provide enough power for continuous operation.   Towing requirements would double your energy needs which makes DIY even more difficult & expensive."

There is some truth to the email though. A top of the line Kia Soul SX-L (gasoline powered) is about $30000, where as an EV soul will run north of $40000. However, the government just released an EV incentive as of today so it may help lower the cost to consumers to get into EV powered vehicles.  It is debatable how “environmental friendly” EV cars really are. Nickel is mined by big diesel powered machinery to gather materials to build batteries. Cars are shipped around the world using big ships running on fossil fuels. ‎ However, there is no point getting into this as it boils down to perspective with strong points on both ends.  The one thing I do like to ask potential EV customers myself is whether they believe that driving an EV will save them money in the long term. This is not true right now because the cost of an EV car compared to its gasoline counterpart is so much more expensive at the point of sale. Taking the Soul for example, a $10000 price difference does indeed buy you a lot of gas (e.g., $2000 per year on gas will get you 5 years of driving). Then we can take into consideration that gasoline cars are known and likely more reliable, regardless of the brand.  However, when it boils down to buying a car. It should only be the buyer’s views that matter. We as sales people are only here to guide and give information. Unfortunately, the tone of my salesman was very very poor. The exact same thing could have been said in a much more appropriate manner with less of a tone of “you shouldn’t buy an EV because blah blah blah blah”.  Lastly, we do not carry EV souls. Only two dealers in BC have the privilege of selling them‎. If you have any more general questions for me George, you may email or call me anytime. Send my apologies to your friend as well.

I am getting ~4 miles a kWh, so ~3 cents a mile for me. If you drive more than 50ish, you may need to upgrade to the 220-240V chargers as they charge twice as fast.  I really like the worry free/no gas stations/almost no maintenance of it.  I thought about buying one when my lease was almost up, but they extended it at the same price for another year. I there is a Leaf forum on the subreddit sidebar that has tons of info, including pricing for purchase and leasing around the country."
electricvehicles,309wb9,kieranmullen,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:01:30 2015 UTC,Highly advise doing 220 at home. You can DIY. It is not that scary.  Climate preconditioning is nice plus charging takes longer on 110 in cold weather as the battery warmer takes a bit of juice.
electricvehicles,309wb9,Anderlan,2,Thu Mar 26 06:07:02 2015 UTC,"Buy it.  I also lease a LEAF and I'm going to have to do some hard math at the end about paying out the extra miles I put on it or buying it.  That will suck because when the lease ends, a LEAF is definitely going to be worth less money--if everything goes as it should and the market is full of 200 mile EVs and the world is making millions of khwrs of lithium cells per year.  LEAF is going to lose value.  That's the better future.  But the Volt, will always be a perfectly functional hybrid!  It can't possibly lose any more value than every other gas car."

electricvehicles,309wb9,motley2,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:44:24 2015 UTC,$19K sounds reasonable for 16k miles.   I called Ally and they said that I could by my 2012 Volt with ~45k miles at the end of the lease for $23k.   I was thinking more like $17k.
electricvehicles,309wb9,ImTheDerek,2,Thu Mar 26 01:46:17 2015 UTC,"Not only is The volt in its first gen, but in some states the combined incentives are over $10k. So without even taking the fact the refresh is next year, depreciation is already starting at $30k instead of $40k. Low mileage won't keep up used prices until incentives expire either. Because so many people are leasing EVs, were getting into the time period where an influx of expired leases are going to start coming into the market.  If you don't plan to keep an EV long term, lease it. I agree that if you want to buy used, try to knock off $3k or so."
electricvehicles,309wb9,ifwinterends,2,Wed Mar 25 21:48:36 2015 UTC,"The 2012 Volt was $40,000 new, so you're already getting it at the tumbled resale price."

The people buying the car doesn't differentiate based on the car. They only care about leather seats and a good touch screen sound system. Followed up by 'does the car look good' like a mustang will tend to maintain it's value because it looks cool.  The problem is more so to do with that they start out life more expensive than their counterpart.   Not sure how many years from now until they will start matching.

electricvehicles,30160j,lagvvagon,1 point,Tue Mar 24 08:38:44 2015 UTC,That's actually a pretty fair assumption considering it has a Nurbering lap time. Of course if you limited the p85d down to r8 stats I'm sure it'd do much better.

Saab was revived by a Swedish-Chinese businessman through a shell company, National Electric Vehicle Sweden, with support from the Chinese city of Qingdao, but things quickly fell apart. Qingdao pulled support after NEVS failed to deliver Saab EVs which Qingdao had ordered.   NEVS has been in bankruptcy protection since mid-2014, nobody is interested in bailing them out (All the Chinese and Indian automakers they've courted have said no), they lost the rights to use the Saab name a while ago, and they never had the rights to use Saab's translated name (""Shenbao"") in China, which was to be their target market. Chinese automaker SAIC bought the rights to Shenbao and Saab's IP from GM in 2009 and currently sells cars in China (including EVs) built on Saab platforms with Saab technology.   NEVS's business model was lunacy. They (allegedly) wanted to build electrified outdated Saab models (which could no longer be exported to the EU due to regulations) in Sweden to export to China, where they would be subject to heavy tariffs and ineligible for subsidies. NEVS's electric Saabs would be competing with more modern Chinese-made EVs (including the Leaf) with major subsidies and no tariffs. NEVS would also compete with SAIC's more modern Saab-based EVs sold under the name Saab is known as in China.  NEVS has (or had?) very little resources and couldn't even deliver their first order of 200 EVs placed by Qingdao City.   Given their unfeasible business model and inability to meet their first major order I would say NEVS was not actually a serious effort to create an electric automaker but rather an attempt to buy the Saab name, establish a new brand image of Saab being an electric car maker, then sell it onto a Chinese/Indian automaker before any widescale Saab EV production began. Obviously that idea fell apart when no major automakers were interested in them.  tl;dr: The Saab brand is still dead and this project was never a feasible one"

electricvehicles,2zohbn,harshcougar,6,Fri Mar 20 15:08:01 2015 UTC,Right now you can get some pretty fantastic deals on these cars. My local dealers are advertising 30k off. That plus the federal tax credit makes it a pretty sweet deal.

electricvehicles,2zohbn,harshcougar,5,Fri Mar 20 15:27:58 2015 UTC,"/u/bluefang08 is right. The GM incentive was 25k these days, and then the dealers have some wiggle room. Then you get the 7,500 federal and only 1,500 CA. HOV stickers through 2019 in CA. Remember you are being taxed on 80k though.   They didn't produce that many so good luck finding one. I had to fly to get mine with the adaptive cruise control. They do not lease any more so owning a technology like this when the new volt is coming out with 50 miles of range...?  It's not for everyone. The back seats can only fit small people (teenager sized) it's heavy and the acceleration is nothing compared to the tesla. You don't get nearly the utility out of a volt with the hatchback though. The back seats of the ELR fold but the center one is still there so skis yes but boxes no.   But it is plush the seats kill the tesla, there is a cup holder (and its automated where tesla has none) and my favorite part is it sounds like a spaceship when you start it. It is a creature comfort car for the front two passengers.   Feel free to ask any more questions!"

I myself have a rare car (Tesla Roadster) -- so I am agreeing that the ELR is about as common as a unicorn.  When I was in Florida this past Christmas I saw an add in the newspaper that said you could buy an ELR for $48,000 after incentives and tax breaks.

A 1.5 was about the same list as what I got the ELR for, but it had nothing on the creature comforts, and since it was used was actually 10k more in loss incentives. The 2.5 was worth considering. I wonder what this new battery upgrade will run you.  The thing that tipped the scales though was the insurance! As under 25 male even with no accidents it was close to 300/mo.

People kind of forget the other things that make it feasible.  Production Costs, Weight, Size, Capacity, Material Availability, Charge rate, discharge rate, lifespan, and safety. Those all have to come together to make it work in a car.  If you have twice the capacity and it takes twice as long to charge and twice as long to discharge, you didn't really help current needs.   On the other hand, you have twice the capacity for the same size and weight and it charges and discharges just as quickly as today, but it's lifespan is one third the Li-Ion, people wouldn't go for that either.   If you think that Tesla isn't constantly trying gain an edge on battery tech every day, its pretty short sighted.

It's nice to invest and have things developed to create surprises but we're talking about a battery that has yet to be mass produced and used for EVs, in other words it's not a safe bet short term. I lack faith in VW, nothing so far hints that they will be the first ones to deliver a production car with that range, actually there already is a converted car that has over 700km range, the Letrika Metron 7.

It forms in the first couple of cycles, and if it’s stable, it prevents further degradation of the electrolyte. Well, the SEI on silicon is very different from the SEI on carbon. Right now, cycle life of those batteries is not good enough for automotive use. They can store a whole lot of energy, but then the battery degrades really fast. Recent work has shown that our materials form more stable SEI layers on silicon, allowing batteries with silicon anodes to last longer, in some cases by factors of two.”"

The same battery would desist after 2½ years if kept at a constant desert temperature of 41°C (106°F). Once the battery is damaged by heat, the capacity cannot be restored. The life of a battery also depends on the activity and is shortened if the battery is stressed with frequent discharge.   Also, its strongly believed that many of the early Nissan Leaf battery 'failures' (not failures directly, but massive losses in capacity) were due to high temperatures found in much of the southwest of the United States.  Nissan even had to develop and entirely new battery:  https://autos.yahoo.com/news/nissan-leaf-battery-cost-5-500-replacement-heat-134437499.html"

That is, all other things being equal, the internal resistance of a typical Li-sulfur cell is about 50 times higher than the internal resistance of a Leaf Li-ion module.  Another way of looking at it: to get a 90% energy efficiency during discharge, a Leaf battery must be discharged no faster than over 1 hour, a typical Li-sulfur battery no faster than 2 days."
electricvehicles,2zbx7b,1Davide,4,Wed Mar 18 02:40:47 2015 UTC,"Huh.  It really is only a 0.2C charging rate? Li-ion can have up to 10C for bursts...  Now you've got me thinking about a LiS/Li-ion hybrid pack.  Starting with the 24kWh pack of the Leaf, and replacing half of the mass with a LiS pack, you'd end up with 12kWh Li-ion/40kWh LiS pack.  Between the two, you'd be able to draw up to 128kW at any given point (120kW/10C from the Li-ion, 8kW/0.2C from the LiS).  In such a scenario, the LiS battery would function, primarily, as an on-board trickle charger.

electricvehicles,2zbx7b,foodnguns,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:11:17 2015 UTC,"I guess you could make it simpler:   1) Discharge: permanently charge the Li-ion battery with LiS, unless power demand is greater than what Li-ion can provide.  2) Recharging: prioritize Li-ion charging. Any additional power goes to LiS.  Adding a few supercapacitors into the mix for ultra high power surge might make this an interesting system for ev engineers I think :P"
electricvehicles,2zbx7b,darkmighty,1 point,Fri Mar 20 06:10:24 2015 UTC,"unless power demand is greater than what Li-ion can provide   The way you phrased this is precisely backwards.  If the power demands are more than the Li-ion can provide, you're kind of hosed; if the Li-ion can't provide what you need with it's 120kW, you're not going to be much improved by adding in your additional 8kW.   Recharging: prioritize Li-ion charging. Any additional power goes to LiS.   This also seems backwards.  Let's say, for example, you've got a L2 charger, pushing 20kW, and your battery pack is at 30% (3.6kWh/12kWh).  In 25 minutes, you'll be at 12kWh/12kWh, for 100%/30%.   Then, to get to full charge, you're going to take  210 minutes (28kWh), for a total charging time of 255 minutes.  On the other hand, if you prioritize charging the LiS, after 25 minutes, you'll be at 8.64kWh/15.36kWh (the same 24kWh), and it'll only take about 185 minutes to get to full charge.  So in the Li-Ion-First charging scenario, it takes 3.5 hours to charge the LiS battery after you've spent half an hour charging your Li-Ion pack.  In the LiS-First charging scenario, it takes 3.5 hours total.    Assuming you plug in at the mall at Noon, here's the results:    Scenario Li-Ion Charged LiS Charged Charge after half an hour Charge after 3.5h Fully Charged    (1) Li-Ion First 10kW 12:50pm 4:20pm 20.6kWh (8.6/12) 33.28kWh (12/21.28) 4:20pm   (2) LiS First 10kW 4:15pm 3:30pm 20.6kWh  (4.6/16.0) 50.6kWh (10.6/40) 4:15pm   (3) Li-Ion First 20kW 12:25pm 3:55pm 24.64kWh (12/12.64) 48.64kWh (12/36.64) 3:55pm   (4) LiS First 20kW 12:42pm 3:30pm 25.6kWh  (9.6/16.0) 52kWh (12/40) 3:30pm   (5) Li-Ion First 50kW 12:10pm 3:40pm 26.67kWh (12/14.67) 50.67kWh (12/48.67) 3:40pm   (6) LiS First 50kW 12:11pm 3:30pm 26.53kWh (12/14.53) 52kWh (12/40) 3:30pm    And let's say you get cut off at 3:00, because you only paid for 3 hours of charging.  At that point, since the LiS is set to ""Charge the Li-Ion to full unless plugged in yourself,"" you get the following:    Scenario Total Charge Split at 3:00 Split at 3:30 Split at 4:00    Li-Ion First 10kW 41.28kWh 12/29.28 12/29.28 12/29.33   LiS First 10kW 45.6 9.6/36 12/33.6 12/33.6   Li-Ion First 6kW 33.6kWh 12/21.6 12/21.6 12/21.6   LiS First 6kW 33.6kWh 3.6/30 7.6/26 11.6/22   Li-Ion First 2kW 21.6kWh 9.6/12 12/9.6 12/9.6   LiS First 2kW 21.6kWh 3.6/18 7.6/14 11.6/10    So if you prioritize the LiS battery in charging and discharging, you've got at most an hour and a half until the Li-Ion is back at peak.  And if C Rate is a function of nominal capacity, the Li-Ion will still be able to put forth the same 120kW peak so long as it has the kWh to do so, so you're not even losing too much in the way of instantaneous power for prioritizing the LiS."
electricvehicles,2zbx7b,MuaddibMcFly,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:30:49 2015 UTC,"You're lumping ""charge"" into a single category. Having a full LiS battery an empty Li-ion isn't going to help you. The king here is Li-ion (if you don't know the exact time the customer will charge), so the LiS should act as an always-on trickle charger. It simply absorbs surplus power at the outlet to extend range (the low power is also why it should be always discharging too).  If we had real world data with typical usage, we could actually maximize range/minimize risk with a probabilistic model for certain scenarios (road trip, commute, etc), but without data the discussion isn't very substantiated.  Very clear analysis of yours otherwise."

Is it going to provide you with the 24kW required to drive at 65mph?  No.  But that's why you're always drawing from the LiS first, be it to supply power to the motor/accessories, or to make sure that the Li-Ion battery is charged.  This is why I suggested originally that the Smartest form of charging would be to have the Li-Ion draw from whichever has the greater Wattage.  My only objection to your phrasing is that if you're charging the Li-Ion first, you're going to end up with scenarios where you drain your Li-Ion, and then have a fraction of your range, because you wasted all that time when you could have been charging both"

electricvehicles,2zbx7b,MuaddibMcFly,2,Wed Mar 18 06:45:43 2015 UTC,"Actually, I did a bit more number crunching, and I think they could actually be pretty ok for most people's usage.  A Tesla Roadster has a 53kWh battery pack.  Assuming you replace that completely with a LiS battery, we're talking somewhere around 159kWh of battery, with a maximum draw of somewhere around 32kW.  According to this page the Roadster doesn't draw more than that until you're over 84mph.  Given that a number of production vehicles are artificially limited to that speed or lower, I don't know that anyone would notice.  But back to what it could do: such a car could drive at 75mph for 477 miles.  Cruise at 60mph instead and you're talking 636 miles.  The only downside would be the charging time.  From fully drained, you would be talking about 5 hours to charge, minimum.  Any charging station of 32kW or better would you (slightly more than) 5 hours to get back up to maximum, and a 20kW charging station would take around 8 hours.  On the other side of the coin, you'd get upwards of 100 miles of range (at reasonable speeds) per hour of 30kW charging.  True, the Tesla Super Charger gets you roughly twice that Range Per Hour, but, it's nothing to sneeze at.    If you run the numbers of replacing the pack of a Model S, it gets even better.  Now you're looking at something like a 255kWh pack, with a power output of 51kW (enough power to go nearly 100mph), giving you over 650 miles at 75mph, or over 850 miles at 60mph.  That's over 14 hours of driving.  Plug in to two L2 charging stations (40kW) and in about 6 hours later, you're ready to do it all over again.  That'd be pretty nearly the entire east coast of the US, only having to stop once to sleep (traffic and bathroom breaks notwithstanding)."

electricvehicles,2zb9ca,rootatlocalhost,2,Tue Mar 17 03:25:29 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry about your accident. Two questions:   Do you have a garage or parking space? Are you allowed to install a 240V charger in that garage or parking space?   If the answer to both questions is yes, you should absolutely look into an EV. You should consider leasing rather than buying, since there are many excellent lease deals that allow you to take advantage of the $7500 tax credit discounted over the course of the lease rather than having to claim it on your taxes the year after you buy the EV. The lease will also allow you to ditch the car around the time we should start seeing those 200+ mile next gen EVs.  If you can't install a 240V charger, it may be possible to install a 120V wall plug and use that. However, you'll need to make sure that it's on a dedicated (or mostly dedicated) circuit, since you don't want to breaker to flip and keep you from charging in the middle of the night. Also, you'll only get around 5 miles of charge per hour of 120V charging, meaning it's going to need to be there for 12 hours to fully recover 60 miles. This isn't fatal, but it's much less convenient to own an electric car without a 240V charger.  If you don't have access at home to a 240V charger, two more questions:   Do you have a dedicated parking spot at work? Will your work guarantee charging or ensure you're able to charge every day?   If the answer to both of those questions is yes, an EV may still be good option - although at-home charging is by far the most convenient way to own an EV, some people are able to fully charge at work at 240V and that does the trick. If you can charge both at home and at work with 120V, that might work too. But just 120V charging at work? I probably wouldn't do it.  Ultimately, if you can't charge at home, and charging at work is uncertain, I would recommend you stick with an ICE for now. Even in areas with the best public charging infrastructures, and even if your car supports fast level-3 charging, it is still awkward at best to coordinate charging on standard-range EVs."

electricvehicles,2zb9ca,beernutmark,1 point,Tue Mar 17 10:02:26 2015 UTC,For a worksite charger 110v is usually quite adequate.  Certainly no need for dc charging.

electricvehicles,2zb9ca,rav4evdriver,1 point,Tue Mar 17 14:59:03 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid all of my EV experience is in San Francisco, where we don't get snow and it doesn't get real cold and we have only a handful of Level 3 chargers, so I'm probably not the person to comment on those things.  As such, the only advice I can give it this: even though EVs do great year round in SF, it's clear on the coldest days that range is greatly reduced, and that range for all EVs in sub-freezing weather is greatly diminished. This is due both to the effectiveness of Li-ion batteries as well as the amount of power necessary to run the heater (as EVs don't create heat just by running like an ICE). This means that your 80 mile leaf might be an 80-mile for most of the year, but could be a 50-mile EV on the coldest days. It sounds like that would still work in your scenario, but be aware of it.  Overall happiness? Tremendous. Having a car with fast acceleration, always ready to go in the morning without stopping at the gas station, that runs for essentially nothing off of our solar panels and doesn't have any emissions? It's just amazing.   However, as above, we have a garage, it doesn't get that cold in SF, and we bought an EV that's rated as 30 miles over the commute it takes every day so we rarely have to worry about range. The EV is amazing, but the purchase did require more planning than you'd have to do with a gas car to make sure it was right-sized.

I would not recommend buying any EV other than a Tesla.  Think of that Model 3 you're going to want to buy in 3 years, and ask yourself if the depreciation on the EV you buy will be more than the amount of money you'll spend to lease it.  Now think about buying a 3 year old EV, and how much you'd be willing to pay for it knowing that a $5,500 plus labor battery replacement is probably a year or two in its future.  I'm of the opinion that the resale value minus initial purchase price, vs. amount of money spent on the lease will be such that it makes more sense to lease the EV than to buy it.  That applies to pretty much every EV on the market, with two or maybe three exceptions:  a Tesla, a Rav 4 EV, and maybe the Fiat 500e.  I'm actually going to come out and say flat out, eventually even the Tesla price will be in line with the industry standards.  Everyone's hung up on the resale value of the Model S and not paying attention to the resale value of the Roadster.  The Roaster shares a pretty similar depreciation profile with a similarly priced 911 right now.  The Model S used prices have been falling a lot, especially after the autopilot announcement for cars without the sensors.  I could go on, but no one reads long posts anyway."

electricvehicles,2z86ds,dbkon,7,Mon Mar 16 13:06:52 2015 UTC,"And paywall circumvented!   BERLIN—Automotive group Volkswagen AG said on Friday that it would boost capital investment to €85.6 billion ($107.3 billion) over the next five years, raising concern that fixed costs are spinning out of control.  In its bid to overtake Japan’s Toyota Motor Co. as the world’s biggest car maker, Volkswagen has consistently been one of the industry’s top spenders. But investors are now concerned that rising capital spending could dent profits in the coming years.  In the period from 2015 to 2019, Volkswagen will increase capital spending by about €1.1 billion above previous plans, largely driven by higher development costs associated with upfront investment in new technology needed to reduce CO2 emissions.  Volkswagen’s joint ventures in China, which aren’t consolidated in the group’s results, will invest an additional €22 billion during the same period, financed by the cash flow from the China ventures.  The company announced the investment plan after a meeting of VW’s supervisory board on Friday. It confirms expectations that Europe’s largest automotive group by sales won’t cut capital spending in its drive to push down costs by 2017.  “Development costs will remain high in the future as a result of high innovation pressure and increasing demands on the automotive industry from CO2 legislation,” Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn said in a statement.  “As a Group, we have the expertise and financial strength to continue to extend our technology leadership and to reach our goals for 2018,” he added.  Volkswagen said in July that it is seeking to cut €5 billion in costs at the namesake VW brand. The company is also seeking to cut another €5 billion in costs at the company’s other automotive businesses such as Audi AG, Porsche SE, Skoda and SEAT, according to two people familiar with the matter.  “We did not expect VW to cut its very high capex spending, but this raises some concerns that VW fixed-costs momentum could indeed become a bigger issue,” said Arndt Ellinghorst, head of automotive research at London-based Evercore ISI research group.  More than half of the capital spending will benefit VW’s plants in Germany, the company said. The costs of its domestic operations could also rise significantly in the coming years. The powerful IG Metall trade union is seeking a 5.5% wage increase for workers and is threatening strike action to obtain its demands."

electricvehicles,2z86ds,paulwesterberg,3,Mon Mar 16 14:12:33 2015 UTC,"Seeking Alpha article:   How Volkswagen Thinks It Will Undercut Tesla On Battery Cost      Volkswagen believes it has reached parity with Tesla in terms of battery cost, and should do even better going forward.    The company's battery modules can contain cells from any battery cell maker, including LG, Samsung and Panasonic.    These modules can also contain either flat/square cells, or cylindrical cells just like Tesla.    The Tesla investment case seems to rest heavily on the belief that Tesla will have a battery cost advantage going forward.    Volkswagen is investing $107 billion in developing new models over the next five years, and the company says that electrification is its #1 technology priority.   Ever since Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S successfully entered production in 2012, one of the central issues in the company's investment story has been whether it can sustain a battery advantage over the competition. Volkswagen (OTCQX:VLKAY) invited me to a set of meetings to hear its side of the story, as told by the overall R&D boss, Heinz-Jakob Neusser, and Audi's (OTCPK:AUDVF) R&D boss, Ulrich Hackenberg.  First of all, what do I mean by Tesla having had a battery advantage over the competition? It's not in dispute in the industry that Tesla so far has productized an electric car with the highest amount of battery capacity per unit of weight, volume and dollar.  If Tesla can maintain this battery advantage as it moves to a lower-priced car 2017-2018 and beyond, ranging from $35,000 to $60,000, such an advantage could potentially overcome the company's lack of scale in producing the rest of the car, and could therefore make Tesla into a far more relevant automaker than it is today.  In my conversations with Volkswagen's management, I was struck by how much it seems to agree with Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk about the future of the electric car. For example:    Volkswagen believes a shift to electric cars is the biggest paradigm shift in the automobile business over the next decade. This is interesting, because it also acknowledges that in the near term, demand remains quite low. Volkswagen has not released total plug-in electric car sales numbers, but it's not difficult to figure them out by using public records and the company's own isolated statements.  Volkswagen's production of one model alone, the eGolf, is now approximately 30,000 per year annualized. In addition to the eGolf, Volkswagen also offers the eUp and Golf GTE in some markets. Audi has the A3 eTron, and Porsche (OTCPK:POAHF) offers three models. Later this year, the VW Passat GTE and the Audi Q7 eTron enter production. Volkswagen is the middle of launching 40 plug-in electric models for the near term.  To support this massive investment program, the company is allocating a portion of its $107 billion investment budget over the next five years to various forms of electric cars. Coincidentally with the $107 billion of investments, Volkswagen operates 107 plants around the world, including 18 in China alone, where it sold 3.7 million cars in 2014.    In terms of the battery technology debate, Volkswagen agrees with Tesla that the shape of the battery cells essentially doesn't matter. The differentiation will be in other technology choices, such as chemistry, packaging, thermal management, software and so forth.  So far, from what I can gather from shareholders, the bull view of Tesla's prospects seems to have rested on two broad assumptions about the relative battery choices:    Tesla's choice of purchasing cylindrical battery cells from Panasonic (OTCPK:PCRFY) is somehow, in and of itself, giving Tesla an advantage in terms of yielding more capacity per unit of weight, volume and dollar - even for the long term.    Tesla's competitors are somehow religiously opposed to cylindrical batteries, instead preferring flat/square battery cell formats.  Volkswagen denied that either of these two assumptions are true: The company agrees with Tesla that the format choice is essentially a wash, and it has been preparing to use cylindrical batteries side by side with flat/square batteries.  The other factor that Tesla's bull case rests upon is the economics of scale from Tesla's big building under construction in Nevada. In this building, it will cooperate with its anchor tenant, Panasonic, to further reduce the cost of producing batteries. How will Volkswagen meet the challenge of such a large industrial effort?  Volkswagen's strategy to undercut Tesla on battery cost is this: It has standardized on a module size - think, a shoe box - into which battery vendors such as Panasonic, LG (OTC:LGEAF) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) can fit either flat/square battery cells or cylindrical ones such as the ones Tesla has been using.  This interchangeability, therefore, gives Volkswagen the ability to simply play out the battery vendors against each other without having to redesign the car's hardware. On any given day, Samsung, LG and Panasonic will be willing to sell any of two standardized battery sizes (cylindrical and flat/square) for a different price. At this point, Volkswagen can effectively conduct a ""reverse auction"" among the suppliers, in order to secure the lowest price.  This kind of commoditization - not unlikely that we have a very liquid spot price for oil that's traded - would be impossible if the parts weren't interchangeable. Of course, you can always redesign the car based on a new battery, but that takes years and costs huge amounts of money."
electricvehicles,2z86ds,paulwesterberg,2,Mon Mar 16 18:58:03 2015 UTC,"Continued:   Rather, Volkswagen will undercut Tesla on battery cost because it does not put everything on one card, by investing billions of dollars into its own factory whose product has to remain the most technologically competitive, as well as operate at the highest level of capacity utilization in order to be competitive. Volkswagen figures it can consistently pay a lower price per kWh by constantly playing all the battery vendors against each other: Let THEM (the battery cell vendors) make the investment in capex, while WE (Volkswagen) always get the lowest price, thanks to competition.  This is no different than Volkswagen avoiding making its own tires. It would simply not make any sense to vertically integrate this technology.  In addition to undercutting Tesla on battery CELL cost, Volkswagen will also have it own production of the entire battery PACK. Volkswagen believes it has a reasonable chance to be competitive with the cell vendors, once you go to the pack level. It has its internal battery pack factory that competes with the external cell suppliers, such as LG, Samsung and Panasonic. To see how flexible Volkswagen's production is, let's look at three current examples:  eGolf and eUp: Panasonic cells, but Volkswagen makes the battery pack. Golf GTE: Panasonic makes both the cells and the entire pack. Passat GTE: Samsung cells, but Volkswagen makes the battery pack.   In a separate interview, Audi CTO Hackenberg dropped a bomb by confirming how flexible this Volkswagen battery strategy is. He said that the all-new Audi R8 eTron, which Audi expects to have a range of 280 miles, has a battery pack that consists of 52 modules containing a total of 7,488 cells. In other words, 144 cells per module.  7,488 cells in total. You know what that means, folks. It means that Audi is using the same cylindrical cells as Tesla, even though the vendor in this instance is Samsung, not Panasonic.  It's no wonder that the overall battery statistics of this car, the R8, are therefore similar to Tesla. The capacity of the battery pack is similar, the kind of cells used is similar, the weight per kWh is similar, and the range is similar.  The difference is that while Audi uses this Samsung cell today, it is not wedded to what it would be producing in its own battery cell factory, had it been in Tesla's shoes. Audi can switch to LG and Panasonic, and switch from cylindrical to flat/square battery cells, if the battery cell price fluctuates in its favor. It's harder to do that if you own your own factory for which you have paid billions and have to run at close to full capacity utilization in order to be competitive on cost.  Finally, Volkswagen emphasized that the industrial economics of producing all flavors of a car - gasoline, diesel, hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric - totally integrated on the same assembly line are huge. With demand for electric car being both small, uncertain and highly fluctuating in the near term, allocating a specific car and production line to a low-volume electric car is simply a recipe for losing your shirt.  Volkswagen is engineering almost all of its cars to be made with all of these powertrain combinations going forward. There will be a plug-in hybrid and fully electric version of almost every single nameplate under the VW umbrella. Volkswagen already offers more plug-in electric models than any other automaker, and it should soon be at 40 different plug-in electric models.  The one area where Volkswagen does not want to take as a direct and active role in the electric car food chain is the charging network. While it dabbles in small initiatives here and there, it basically wants to stay out of it. It wants other entities, such as gasoline stations, parking garages or other independent service providers, to deal with electric car infrastructure.  The rationale for this is that it does not want to saddle the buyer of a plug-in electric car - who basically is charging only at home and/or at the office - with the cost of building out the infrastructure. It would add to the price of the car, and Volkswagen aims to be the low-cost leader.  While I agree that in the long run, car companies ought not be involved in charging infrastructure build-out, I disagree about the short term. To ensure the best possible customer experience in these nascent electric car days, I think it would be wise for the automaker to take a very active and direct role in funding this civil engineering project. It does not need to last for too many years. After a few years, it can be sold to an independent party - sort of like what happened to Orbitz in the airline industry. But it needs the automaker's far more robust push in these early days.  Conclusion  Volkswagen believes it has eliminated Tesla's battery advantage, and this will play itself out as the new models roll out in the coming years, starting with the Audi R8 eTron in 2015 and the upgraded VW eGolf shortly. By 2018, this strategy will be in full bloom. By making battery modules with interchangeable cells, Volkswagen can play Panasonic, LG, Samsung and others against each other, ensuring the lowest cost at all times. Then, producing the fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars on the existing assembly lines assures the lowest cost for these cars overall."

Increase your vehicle output to the point that people no longer feel like they're waiting overly long for their (bespoke) car, and leverage the profit form straight battery sales to improve infrastructure, production costs, and R&D.  ETA: Hell, it might even be worth a bit extra to accentuate the bespoke aspect of Teslas; ""sure, you could go to the competitors, but then you're just buying some random car.  With us, you buy your car.""  Add a bit more customization, and boom, you make buying a Tesla an experience rather than a simple purchase."

electricvehicles,2z1hpg,afishinacloud,2,Sat Mar 14 18:20:45 2015 UTC,This just highlights the fact that all EV manufacturers are avoiding this very issue. They should all have a compatible form factor that they need to preserve in time so that the user can replace the batteries with new ones even after the warranty is gone and continue using that vehicle way after it reaches end of life as far as manufacturing goes.  Think of it like a computer. You can install a SATA III SSD in a PC that is only SATA II thanks to backwards compatibility AND form factor. We need this in electric cars and we need it yesterday. It's unacceptable going forward not to have common standards.
electricvehicles,2z1hpg,IdleChatMeister,5,Sat Mar 14 19:04:58 2015 UTC,"The great thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from.   Take Tesla, for instance. They've built a ""standard"" battery pack format that works across their product line, the S60 uses the same size and shape pack as their P85D. But it's an entirely different battery from what you'd find in a Leaf. If you forced Tesla to use a leaf pack the car would loose almost everything that makes it a Tesla, and if you forced the leaf to use a Tesla pack it wouldn't physically fit under the small car.  Though I absolutely agree with you in principal. I think what we need are battery modules that share a physical format. You can put whatever chemistry you want into that package, as long as it shares the dimensions and connector. But then you've increased the price of a given car because you've got a more complicated BMS, distributed SOC and battery health monitoring, differing performance based on the number of modules installed, and voltage requirements restricting designs, etc.   I've got a standardized battery module that works in my electric lawnmower, snowblower, gokart, and soon to fit into my off-grid solar system as well. It's not an easy feat.  But I'd love to see it become more popular, it could really change the economics of EVs in general if the batteries were interchangeable not just between cars but also between applications."

electricvehicles,2z1hpg,Bravo_Oscar_Tango,1 point,Sun Mar 15 15:08:17 2015 UTC,"Alex suggets that the buyer should rely on the warranty when the new car is purchased. What about second hand cars where warranty may not apply?  Alex mentioned in his video Idaho Lab which among other projects tests batteries for their own research nationwide. The tools they use are not open to the wide public. Purchase of second hand EVs and Hybrids is a gamble to people who do not have access to right tools to make an informed decision.  We have closed that gap and developed (in New Zealand) tools to test remaining capacity of the High Voltage battery. Those are now available. Use of our tools brings transparency to the second hand High Voltage battery market. There are many ""cowboys"" who sell untested or so called ""reconditioned"" battery packs without producing test results to the buyer.  Proudly made in New Zealand (www.hybrids.co.nz) our technology is affordable for the small business and have already made it's way to USA.  e.g. We have results clearly showing detirioration of one HV Battery pack down to 30% of original design within 5 years vs. another one down to 60% within 6 years (different milage). My message to the potential second hand EV/Hybrid car buyers: demand the test results of the remaining capacity and pack imbalance at the time of purchase, if not provided - negotiate purchase price less the cost of the full HV battery replacement."

electricvehicles,2ysinq,ziko-evol,1 point,Thu Mar 12 15:19:24 2015 UTC,"It's still an expensive car with a 300 miles range in 2018. That's 3 years from now with a product that Tesla released years ago (granted as a sedan, not SUV but still). It's not progress and by 2018 i would have expected cars with that range to cost between $20 000 - 30 000 at most. Maybe Audi will upgrade the batteries and deliver a product with a bigger range. For the price they are aiming a 400 - 500 miles range is achievable by 2018."
electricvehicles,2ysinq,IdleChatMeister,3,Thu Mar 12 15:47:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's going to be more impactful than you give it credit for.  For one thing, Audi has a lot more manufacturing capabilities.  This brings two significant advantages:   They can probably get a discount on bulk batteries, if they decide to really back their EV fleet.  That would put their costs lower for the same quality of vehicle. They can do a ""Buy and Drive"" scenario.  Tesla delivered somewhere on the order of 18,000 Model S's in the first 3 quarters of 2014.  Audi, on the other hand, delivered about that many in December of 2014   Tesla announced the Model X in February 2012, and here we are, 3 years later, and they haven't even begun production.  But, for the sake of argument, lets say that Tesla start delivery of the Model X in January of 2017 (which may or may not be optimistic, but let's roll with it). In 2018, there is going to be a direct competitor for the Model X (luxury/performances SUV), probably at a price point a few thousand dollars lower.  Given the production capabilities of the VWGroup, it's possible that Audi could deliver as many EV-Q6's by December 2018 [as Tesla has delivered Model X's in twice that time].  Additionally, after a year or two of production of EV-Q6's, they might take as little as 3 years to branch out and start delivery of other vehicles, in 3 other categories.  That means that in 2018, Audi has it's answer to the Model X, but by 2021, Audi could have an EV-A7 in direct competition with the Model S, and an EV-A3, which would be the competition for the Model III.  So the fact that they're announcing something that Tesla announced 3 years ago isn't very impressive.  The fact that it means that they're probably going to be capable of delivering cars in all 3 of Tesla's announced category of cars in about the same timeframe that Tesla is finally delivering all three is."
electricvehicles,2ysinq,MuaddibMcFly,2,Fri Mar 13 00:55:05 2015 UTC,What makes you think it will cost less than the X? The R8 is over 200k iirc. I seriously doubt they'll be getting any bulk discounts seeing as Tesla is the only one expanding the worlds Li-ion battery supply in a significant way and they aren't sharing.
electricvehicles,2ysinq,loki7714,3,Fri Mar 13 05:50:46 2015 UTC,"The Chinese announced they will try to match or exceed the Gigafactory production and others were interested as well. I doubt Audi would get theirs from the U.S., a Chinese manufacturer is more likely. Their problem will be energy density. Chemistry will be tweaked a lot by 2018, Li ion might even reach end of life if Mg ion or some other type advances fast enough, but then again price will be everything.   With my first comment I'm not doubting Audi's ability to market the car and sell it, rather i'm criticizing that they are not doing more than Tesla in range per price point nor are they pushing that range to econoboxes."
electricvehicles,2ysinq,IdleChatMeister,2,Fri Mar 13 10:39:03 2015 UTC,"With my first comment I'm not doubting Audi's ability to market the car and sell it, rather i'm criticizing that they are not doing more than Tesla in range per price point nor are they pushing that range to econoboxes   Fair point, but I think I can speak to that, too.  Range to cost ratio: We don't have a price point for the Model X yet.  The ballpark we've heard from Tesla is 5-10% more than the Model S.  The range estimate is about 12% lower than the equivalent Model S.  So that's a base price of $90-95k, for 240 miles of range per charge.  My back of the envelope calculations here would theoretically allow for around 310 miles at $85-90k (assuming comparable efficiency).  Thus, the EV Q6 would be $290 per mile of range, compared to the Model X's #375 per mile of range.  Econoboxes:  One thing that more established companies know is to not promise things before they can realistically be put into production.  If Tesla held to that, they would only now be announcing the Model X, and would not have said word one about the Model III. Tesla announced the Model X 3 years before they started production.   Audi announced their answer to it about 2-3 years before they expect to start delivery.  Based on that we're probably about 5 years away from an EV-A3, which would be the equivalent. And lastly, you're not going to get ""Econoboxes"" out of Audi.  That'd be like asking Chrysler to announce an econobox.  No, Audi's EVQ6 is going to be the proving platform for the technology for the VW Group, which I expect will likely produce an EV Jetta with over 250 miles of range, around the $35-40k price point, by... 2020?"
electricvehicles,2ysinq,MuaddibMcFly,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"It's too early to know the range of the Model X. My speculation about it would be that it will have atleast 1 option for 300 miles range. They pulled the specs from the website also which would hint they are upgrading the original plans.   As for VW doing cheaper 300 miles range cars by 2020, idk it seems reasonable given their lackluster performance with the EV Golf. Personally i'm dissapointed if we have to wait until 2020 for such a car to be released when we have 700 miles km (434 miles) EV converted cars from 2014. Production models are a huge dissapointment so far."

electricvehicles,2ysinq,badcatdog,1 point,Sat Mar 14 02:19:20 2015 UTC,"Well, for one, the most expensive Audi on their US Website starts at around $140k, sure, but the equivalent model that isn't designated ""Racing,"" the A8, is only around $80k.  For another, the most expensive starting point for their SUVs is around $50k, for their Q7 model.  Given the base price for every Platform Upgrade in SUVs costs somewhere around $8k ($32k Q3, $39k Q5, $48k Q7) it seems likely that the base price, before the battery and electronics, should be somewhere in the $45k range.  Then add in another $40k for 100kWh of batteries, etc, and you're looking at the same base price as for the Model S 85D.  ...and that's assuming that the price that Audi would pay for 100kWh of batteries is more than what I, buying from someone who salvages wrecked Leafs, would today.  So yeah, I'm fairly confident that Audi can price the EV Q6 slightly lower than the Model X, especially given that it will likely be built on the same platform as the Q5."

In the case of a series hybrid the diesel engine is simply used as a generator, and here in Minnesota we're currently rolling out the Xcelsior hybrid bus to add to our existing hybrid bus fleet. Sounds like the Xcelsior will simply use its ICE for electricity generation, in place of larger batteries. This should provide it with greater efficiency than conventional hybrids.  The big problem for electric bus fleets is the cost, and with a hybrid fleet the cost of the bus is lower, which is where a lot of people holding the purse strings care about prices."

At best, with a batch of solar panels on board, the buses on the shorter routes could make it through a single service day by more or less draining their batteries.  Even with that, the longer routes would have to charge or trade off vehicles twice per day (assuming a fullly charged vehicle every morning).

electricvehicles,2ycek5,cleric3648,2,Tue Mar 10 18:58:18 2015 UTC,"On a car the size and weight of a Tesla it won't add enough to make a difference.  Basically the car would have to be tiny and lightweight for it to make a substantial contribution. I've always wondered whether you could do it with something with an early Mini Moke because at 400 odd KG you have a very low starting weight before the conversion. You could probably build on about 3 SunPower panels rated at 327w each (20% efficient). Giving just under 1kw of max input. Keep the batteries and engine small and light weight and it might work out for a short commute or light weekend work. I suspect you'd probably be charging 2-3 days for a short trip of 15-20 km. Or you could just use it in a assisted charge mode where you supplement the solar with grid power or more panels on your house.  Edit: lets do some math: Area of 3 panels: 1559x3138 (vs vehicle: 1,300x3,050); weight: 56kg Batteries: 260x18650 @ 10kg gives ~5kWh At an ideal angle the panels could produce 5 kWh in a nice sunny day... but most likely they'll only do about 3 because of various non-optimal positioning and charge losses. So it seems I wasn't far off in my guess of 2 days to charge the pack. Range is going to be a problem... with such a small pack I'm guessing you'd get about 25-30 km of usable range. Which would actually work for me, because my commute is like 3 km. Hmmmmm  Yes the panels would make it top heavy... and I'd worry about the car being picked up by high wind and tipped over. The panels also extend out beyond the sides which might make it hard to get the mods complied with the government. But it's seems plausible unless I'm wildly wrong about something?"

electricvehicles,2ycek5,Quality_Bullshit,2,Mon Mar 9 04:19:57 2015 UTC,"It can work, it just can't work well enough to be worth it.  The panel has to fit the curve of the roof, otherwise the aerodynamic drag it induces would overwhelm the gains from solar power, so the panel will be more expensive than the same size installed on a building's roof.  Second, the panel can't be at the optimal angle, or even close to it,  so it will get less power than most solar arrays of the same size.  Third, cars don't spend that much time in the sun, if you park in the sun it gets unbearably hot, and you need to use power to cool it down, and cars are often parked in garages.  Fourth, there just isn't that much space on the roof of a car, so you'll only get a mile or two out of a full day in the sun. It just isn't worth the expense, because you get more range per dollar spent by just increasing the size of the battery a little."

All the auto ""people who know"" the US auto market claim that there is no market/infrastructure for Diesel in the US.  A friend of mine was explicitly told as much by Volvo engineers when he picked up their Millionth Car at the factory.. Emissions standards in the US are stupid.  Instead of <Nastyness> Per Unit Distance, they measure Concentration of <Nastyness> of tailpipe emissions.  This screws Diesel, because Diesel puts out more pollutants per unit volume (~1.3-1.4x the nastiness per gallon when compared to gas), it also drives somewhere around twice the distance per gallon (0.65-0.70x the nastiness per mile). But, because of how we measure it, it looks worse.  Kind of like how, on paper, Electric vehicles (and to a lesser extent, diesels) look less sporty, because they tend to have a lower HP rating..."

It simplifies the whole process and downsizes the motor/controller requirements. It also helps with motor wiring to not need to electrically reverse, just use the reverse gear.  You'll want a pack somewhere around 150v or more. Thats around 50 large format lithium batteries in series. You might want to look into used nissan LEAF batteries, they are physically robust and easy to mount.  For a controller I'd recommend the Soliton1. It's rugged and incredibly simple to use. It has a wide voltage range so you can add more battery later without rewiring or changing parts out.  For a motor the standard is pretty much a Warp 9. Reliable and pretty common.

Motor torque doesn't matter, what you're seeing is the result of power to weight ratio. What does matter is wheel torque, and that power indicates the amount of torque that is available at a given rpm. Because cars have wheels that operate within a certain rpm range, we know that a motor with more power will provide more torque at the wheels within that rpm range. A motor with more power will always be able to provide more torque at a given rpm than a motor with less power.   Edit: Also notice the lb per hp number on that chart."

If you want to go fast, more voltage and a better controller, such as the Zilla, will help.  For a 60 mile range, get around 16-20kWh worth of batteries (the real number will depend on vehicle weight, aerodynamics, and EV system efficiency)  As for bodies - something lightweight.  Old VWs are popular because they are dead simple, have tons of aftermarket support, and you can find bolt-on EV motor mounts.  Older Japanese compacts are also popular, such as a Civic or CRX.  Old British sports cars are light and look great, but they're not as well engineered.  Transmission - keep it.  I had an MGB conversion many years ago, and I did find myself using the transmission.

If you double the number of cells inside that 10kWh pack and maintain adequate thermal management you can maintain the 20C rating.  Now, because of the larger capacity, you can put out 400kW.  That is basically the reason the 60kWh version of the Model S is not as quick as the 85kWh version.  The individual cells have a certain C rate that is possible so the 85kWh version can put out more kW since it has more cells.  So the more kWh in a pack the more kW it can put out assuming the C rate can be maintained.  Of course on the cell level that probably doesn't hold up as often."

electricvehicles,2xhp9q,siredmundsnaillary,3,Sat Feb 28 20:16:45 2015 UTC,"I have one. The car is nice and drive fantastically well. The battery gives plenty of mileage for my need. During winter it's around 90-120 km depending of how bad I drive, and how much heat I put on. During the summer it's around 120-160 km. The driving style has a big effect in my opinion. It forces you to foresee what might make your car brake a longer time in advance than in a normal car, to be able to use the automatic brakes. Also it gives a big incentive to not accelerate too fast and drive slowly on the highway (90km/h). All this combine makes you drive more slowly, cautiously and more zen. Driving becomes much less stressful than with a normal car.   On the downsides, in my experience, there are a lot of charging issues. The car is very sensitive to electrical imperfections and will refuse to charge or stop charging after a few minutes. In my experience, this happens quite often, and this makes planning trips passing through unknown charging stations more complex, as I will need plan B and C in case the charging stations don't work with my car. Also there is a big risk that your electrical home installation is not good enough for the ZOE and will need an upgrade. In my case it has been a huge pain in the ass.  Another downside is the remote-connection. It has been very buggy and not working well during the first year I subscribed to it. After 6 months it stopped working altogether and needed a car upgrade at the resale to be able to work again. I still don't know if it works because I refuse to pay for the service another year.   Edit: forgot units  Second edits: considering the troubles I had, how much value the car has lost during its first year (easily 25%), and how much more it can lose if a new comer brings in a better cheaper battery tech, I would rather have leased it. or even better leased the leaf, that has less charging issues."

Is the term actually a bit of a misnomer and it is more like a static unit of energy, rather than a charge for time using electricity?  And thank you for the reminder about the up-front cost for a charging station."
electricvehicles,2xhvyr,_data_monkey_,2,Sat Feb 28 23:15:32 2015 UTC,"A kWh is a kW of power for one hour.  A 120V adaptor charges at about 1.4kW; a 240V adaptor charges at ~7kw.  The battery has a constant size, though, about 20kWh usable.  Including ~85% charging efficiency, a full charge will be about 24kWh.  With the 120V adaptor this will be about 17 hours; with the 240V adaptor this will be about 3.5 hours.  The energy in both cases will be about the same: 24kWh (there are slight differences in efficency etc that cause minor variation. Install the 240V adaptor if you're regularly going to be driving long distances, but 120V is 4-6 miles of range per hour, so if you're home for 10 hours it's quite a bit of range compared to normal driving.

electricvehicles,2xhvyr,fooljoe,1 point,Sun Mar 1 02:54:16 2015 UTC,"there are slight differences in efficency etc that cause minor variation   The difference can actually be rather pronounced. In my Rav4-EV, for example, I've measured about 80% efficiency @ 240V and only 66% efficiency @ 120V.  That may sound like a small difference, but over a year's worth of driving (12,000 miles) that efficiency difference could amount to more than 1,200 extra kWh used to charge. When you combine that with the fact that most utilities only offer the best rates for 6-9 hour windows that would be very difficult to stay within @ 120V, you can see that a 240V EVSE could quickly pay for itself."
electricvehicles,2xhvyr,fooljoe,2,Sun Mar 1 05:23:16 2015 UTC,"Upgrading to 240V will actually lead to you paying LESS to charge, for a couple of reasons: First, charging at 240V is much more efficient than charging at 120V. Over a year's worth of driving you might use an extra 1,000 kWh or more because of the inefficiency of 120V charging.  Second, in most cases the best rate you can get from your utility is only good for a relatively short amount of time (midnight to 6 am in my case.) This means that unless you drive very little (and make sure to plug in every night) it'll be almost impossible to keep all your charging within that window @ 120V.  So unless you barely drive you should definitely plan on getting a 240V charging station. With a little research you can probably find a way to get one and get it installed for fairly cheap.  And yes, you do seem to be misunderstanding kWh a bit. kWh are analogous to gallons in a gas car - it's a unit of energy that'll translate to a number of miles driven (probably 3-4 miles in your case.) And just like a gas car, all ""fill-ups"" are not equal: if you've already got half a ""tank"" then you only need half the kWh to fill up. With an EV you'll likely find that you fill up almost every night, even if you only used 20-30% of the battery, while with a gas car you're probably used to waiting until the tank's almost empty. So it makes more sense to think about how much it'll cost you per mile than per ""fill-up."""
electricvehicles,2xhvyr,valherum,1 point,Sun Mar 1 05:36:05 2015 UTC,"20kWh @$.05/kWh = $1. Yes.  Upgrading to a 240 will cut the time in half, but the cost will be about the same.

electricvehicles,2xhvyr,BraveRock,1 point,Sun Mar 1 00:32:23 2015 UTC,It is easiest to multiply your rate per kilowatt hour by the size of your battery.

To make the math easy, We will assume there is 20kWh of usable power.  So your math is correct, if you charge when the rates are $0.10/kWh then $2.00 per complete fill up.  If you charge when your rates are $0.45/kWh, then $9.00 to go (at most) 70 miles.    Assume, for a moment of comparison, that you bought a car that got 35 MPG.  Charging at peak rates ($0.45) would be that same as paying $4.50 per gallon of gas.  Cheapest rates would be the same as paying $1.00 per gallon.    So, make sure you can actually recharge at the very cheapest rates, or a large part of the ""savings"" will disappear.  A 220v (Level 2) charger will cost $500-1000 (plus installation which could be anywhere from $200 to $2000).  You need to factor that into the overall cost equation as well."
electricvehicles,2xhvyr,Domukin,1 point,Sat Feb 28 21:56:34 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to add my experience so far. I have a 220V Bosch charger. Got it for $1000 when I leased the Spark EV. Didn't require any special install other than getting a 220V outlet to plug it into (which took the electrician all of 30 min). I'm sure it can be more elaborate with other chargers but it doesn't have to.  In addition to what has already been said, I would also add that you contact your Electric company to see if they offer special rates for EV vehicles. Most of these will have you charge overnight, and the cars can be programmed to charge during off-peak schedule hours. This will get you charging at $.10 per kilowatt hour instead of $.45 per kilowatt hour.  Besides the monetary savings, I would also consider the savings to your time which can be significant. For example I save at least 20 minutes going to work because I get access to the carpool lane, that adds up to about 13 hours every month. I also never go to a gas station anymore, Which doesn't seem like much time, but if you add it up, it ends up being a few hours out of the year, which could be spent doing something else. It's also a great feeling to not have to buy gas."
electricvehicles,2xhvyr,_gosolar_,1 point,Sat Feb 28 22:14:24 2015 UTC,"I think of it as watthours per mile.  The smaller EVs use about 200wh for 1 mile, or about 1kwh for 5 miles.  However, as others have stated, recharging isn't perfectly efficient. You have to put in around 1.2kwh to get 1kwh out of the car. Adjust for efficiency before converting to dollars and cents. So if you want to drive 50 miles, you will need 12kwh of energy which is about $1.20.  The size of the battery only matters with respect to range and charging time from empty.  MPGe doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I only look at that to compare relative efficiencies between cars.  (disclaimer: I don't actually own a PEV yet)"
electricvehicles,2xhvyr,dodge_uk,1 point,Sun Mar 1 08:51:22 2015 UTC,"seriously??? you need to live in the real world of economics. Running an EV is a negligable cost.  The cost to charge an electric vehicle may as well be zero. I certainly consider that driving my car is free. Its not a noticeable difference to my electric bill.  However, going to a fuel pump and sticking in £140 a throw to travel 350 miles, that makes a difference. When I drive my audi Q7 on long trips using a fuel pump is physically painful and emotionally distressing, and expensive.   I like my electric car."
electricvehicles,2xh3fi,vanwinklec,5,Sat Feb 28 17:10:17 2015 UTC,"FWIW, only the original purchaser is eligible for most federal and state EV incentives. The federal tax rebate is $7,500 and here in Georgia the state offers another $5,000 rebate. That takes the price of a brand new 2015 Leaf down to about $17,500. You might not have such generous state incentives, but it's worth looking into."
electricvehicles,2xh3fi,Norm_Peterson,3,Sat Feb 28 18:36:16 2015 UTC,"A huge factor is the climate in which the car was used.  The Leaf only air-cools their battery pack (as opposed to Tesla, and BMW, and others that water-cool their packs).  So, if you live in Arizona, and the daily temperatures are 100F and higher during the summer, the battery pack will see very high operating temperatures, and degrade much faster than one that never saw those temperatures.  Not having liquid cooling on the battery pack was a cost and weight savings measure.  It was a trade-off, as all design decisions are."
electricvehicles,2xh3fi,louv,1 point,Sat Feb 28 22:01:52 2015 UTC,"What louv says here is very relevant to the 2012 battery. The later leafs with the ""lizard"" pack are less susceptible to the heat. That said active cooling is a good thing in extreme heat."

electricvehicles,2xh3fi,dlopoel,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:33:36 2015 UTC,"Consider this, what are the odds that a new car in the same price range as the leafs comes around with a significant better tech (like battery!)? It's quite high. When this will come your leaf will take a big hit, and lose a big part of its value. This happened for the Renault fluence in Denmark. It was based on a battery swapping company called Better place that went bankrupt. This car has no fast charging capability. So after the company went bankrupt and new cars came along with better mileage and faster charging capability, the car was discontinued by Renault lost more than 50% of its value on the second hand market. This happened over one year!  It's probably safer to buy a second hand EV in term of depreciation, but as you say, you take a risk with the mileage."
electricvehicles,2xh3fi,thx1139,1 point,Sun Mar 1 07:23:21 2015 UTC,"2012 Leaf leaser here. My car has 30,000 miles. I use it for work carrying various loads. Personal use too. Reside in Arlington, Va. It's still winter & I'm not happy with the drop in range. Even last fall, before the below freezing weather, the range was dropped. I leased for tax business purposes, however I would have chosen the same for personal use alone, because we all know the technology will advance. But what really matters is the climate you're in, what distance you travel daily, and are you okay with the amount of charging station outings within your range limit. This increases your travel distance a bit. The last thing, is does the car have the level 3 plug, which for my business travel (delivery) was a  critical option to have. As for buying something else, you need to give more details on your use & habits. This is what is needed for EV purchases."
electricvehicles,2xh3fi,fooljoe,1 point,Sat Feb 28 21:54:25 2015 UTC,"Don't buy a used Leaf without knowing EXACTLY what the battery state of health (SOH) - or percentage-of-new capacity - is. At a glance you can get a rough idea of the battery degradation by looking at the capacity bars to the right of the charge bars on the dash, but two cars with the same number of capacity bars can have very different actual capacity.  If you're shopping for used Leafs get the LeafSpy app if you have an android device or the LeafStat app if you have iOS, and get the associated ELM327 OBD2 reader (bluetooth for android and wifi for iOS). These apps will tell you the battery's SOH, as well as other useful information.  But there's a twist to the whole battery capacity story: While in general getting a car with more capacity is better, if you get a car with less capacity it could mean you'll soon qualify for Nissan's battery capacity warranty. If your Leaf falls below 9 capacity bars (so about 65% SOH) before 5 years or 60,000 miles, you get a new battery ($6k value) for free! Of course it goes without saying that if you think you can get a great deal on a Leaf with 9 bars that's about to get a new battery make sure you check the VIN with Nissan to ensure that the capacity warranty hasn't been voided for any reason.  For more on this and all things Leaf read up at mynissanleaf.com. And like others have said, in most areas the deals on leasing a new Leaf are so good you better be getting a real good deal on a used one to justify it. Even if you're someone who's wary of leasing in general, leasing can be a great deal specifically for EVs."

electricvehicles,2xbxhb,dodge_uk,1 point,Fri Feb 27 16:24:57 2015 UTC,"(upvote for the short circuit reference)  I personally felt like the LEAF felt a bit like a novelty after driving the eGolf. The eGolf was a solid CAR. I went back and forth in my mind about the advantages and disadvantages of a car that is built from the ground up as an electric car vs. a car that has been around for awhile and now there is an electric version. When I shut the doors on my eGolf, I feel like I'm closing myself safely into a well made, sturdy machine.   Honestly, I'm a tech guy at heart, so some of the bells and whistles on the LEAF I wish were present on the eGolf (the sheer number of cameras on the LEAF are mind boggling).  A few things in the eGolf are... what's the word... confusing? Not confusing in the sense of ""I don't understand how this thing works,"" but more ""I don't understand why this thing works this way."" Maybe I just need to read the manual a bit further. One thing is when I turn on the car, the air always turns on. Automatically. Every time. I'm sure there's a reason, and sometimes I'm thankful for it, but most of the time, I remember to turn it off half way to my destination and then wonder how many more miles I could have gotten if I turned it off right away.  The other thing is when I plug my iPhone into the ""Media In"" port, it automatically starts playing. I guess its the equivalent of putting a CD in. Either way, I'd like to have the option to turn that off so I can just charge my iPhone in there and still listen to the radio or XM or whatever else and not have it kick on.  LASTLY....... the whole idea of the ""infotainment"" system is great, but sometimes if the radio is off and I'd like to turn on navigation or see some extended stats on my car, I have to turn the whole thing on which brings the radio up, etc. The only way to turn the audio off (that I know of) is by turning the volume all the way down. Having those two sides tied together doesn't make all that much sense to me.  AGAIN, this all may be my lack of knowledge in the deeper workings of the car, but as of right now, those are the only things I have to say about it that I'm not the biggest fan of.  The car is so much fun to drive. I like playing around with the multiple recuperation modes (four total) and with the ""Normal"" v ""Eco"" v ""Eco +"". When driving around town, its super rare I ever touch the brake pedal.  Hope this is what you were looking for. I didn't get to spend a week in the LEAF before writing all this so there may be similar idiosyncrasies in the LEAF, but since I have two children, the eGolf just felt like the better car."

I did say I would be more than happy to share my charging capability, but that wasn't a big incentive for them.  The bigger issue is if they institute an HOA funded project that I could ""buy into"", offering proper metering of energy used could become very complicated.  A simple fixed rate may make sense if it's just one or two people - but if I only drive ~6k miles / year, I likely use far less than another user.  My proposal was basically trying to take the burden off the HOA.  There's currently no charging at all - I would likely end up getting 50A.  Thanks for your comment - a great analogy."

electricvehicles,2x0f86,Lonelan,3,Tue Feb 24 21:42:10 2015 UTC,The generator is 25kW which is 33.5hp. A Nissan Leaf requires 18hp to maintain speed at 70mph. The i3 should require less hp due to its slightly smaller size and lower weight. So the generator should be adequate to keep the vehicle moving and charge the battery to enable short bursts of acceleration as long a you are not driving up mountain passes on the interstate with a dead battery.

It started off with Apple accusing Samsung of copying the first iPhone (it looked to me like they kind of did) but just kept going to more and more absurd levels (who does not remember Apple suing over round corners). At one time Apple managed to get Samsung devices banned from sale in the USA for a while (I forget if those were tablets or phones or both). All the while Apple was using Samsung ICs within many of these devices though trying hard to avoid having to do so.  Now Apple is to produce an electric car that uses either Samsung batteries or Samsung cells or maybe both.  This should be entertaining to watch.

Is it the best at one little task?  No.  But it is adequate at everything.  The only part it was really lacking in was fuel economy, but making a PHEV minivan speaks volumes to its normal uses.  The minivan is the kid carrier, the local trip taker, and the occasional road trip mobile.

electricvehicles,2wwopk,wewewawa,6,Mon Feb 23 20:23:07 2015 UTC,"For larger energy usages, like cars, hydrogen does not make sense. First, they are promoting hydrogen as alternative to fossil fuels, and 95% of hydrogen coming from FOSSIL fuels (natural gas). Mostly from fracking. So hydrogen does not solve environment issues (unless you think fracking is good for environment), and nobody will produce hydrogen on large scale with electrolysis while cheaper alternative is available.  As for getting hydrogen from water, for hydrogen you have to put in 100kWh of energy to get 23kWh to move the car. In EV, for 100kWh, you get 70kWh to move the car. So hydrogen station creating hydrogen on site will use so much electricity that it could charge 3 times more electric vehicles. For example, electricity used to fill up 1000 fuel cell vehicles for 300 miles, could fill up 3000 electric vehicles for the same mileage.  Price of hydrogen? They are going long distances to hide price of hydrogen, even giving hydrogen for free for 3 years with Mirai. Because if you would know the price, you would not buy the car. And it will be at least 2 times more expensive than petrol, and 5 times more expensive than EV for the same distance.  Who loves hydrogen? Big oil companies, because they produce it from fossil fuels, and fuel cell cars would let them keep their monopoly.  You can say, we will put solar panels, wind turbine or any other renewable and make hydrogen that way for 'free', but that also does not make sense, because with the same solar panels or wind turbines you can support 3-4 times more electric than hydrogen vehicles."

What they have done is allow use of production and distribution of hydrogen patents without charge. As to fuel cell patents or in fact any patents connected to the FCV i.e. anything not specifically for the production or distribution of hydrogen, they will have a 5 year expiry. Not only that to use ANY of these patents requires signing an agreement with Toyota (the terms of which I can only guess at). Please stop putting out these uncritical and misleading articles that appear to have been copied and pasted from a Toyota press release and in no way reflect reality. Now if you look at what Tesla did: they have no restrictions on any of their patents used in good faith, they do not require a written agreement in fact you don't even have to talk to Tesla, just use them if you want to.

electricvehicles,2wwopk,TooMuchJargon,3,Tue Feb 24 11:15:02 2015 UTC,"I see nobody yet has an adequate answer for where the hydrogen will come from.   On the other hand, hydrogen fuel costs more per mile than driving an electric car or even a hybrid. And an electric car can, in theory, be charged from any standard power socket, while fuel-cell vehicle owners are dependent on the availability of hydrogen filling stations.  Air Liquide of France, for example, last month trumpeted the completion of its fourth and fifth hydrogen filling station projects on Japanese soil.  JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp., meanwhile, opened its first filling station in December and plans to have 40 by March of next year, according to Japan Times. Tokyo Gas Co [1]. and Iwatani Corp[2]. also unveiled their first filling stations last year.   Looks like it's the natural gas suppliers that are answering the call. Not too surprising, since steam reformation of natural gas remains the preferred method for making hydrogen.  Oh wait, Japan has no natural reserves of methane? I wonder what the emissions picture looks like once you factor in the diesel used to transport all that natural gas from overseas...  On the other hand, hydrogen might make a good storage medium for nuclear energy... otherwise, I have a feeling they're betting on the wrong horse."

Often described as an Extended Range EV, there are periods where the engine doesn't start for months on end and it behaves like any other EV. The EV range for daily commute and most other in-town trips is more than adequate. However, when a highway trip is required, I put my car in ""Hold-Mode"" to set aside the battery for in-town driving. I drive the highway using just the on board generator. The gasoline-only range when driving it this way is comparable to the range of most other similar sized cars.   While I would love to drive a $150,000 P95d Tesla, for me, a $30K Volt is the best of both worlds. The Volt can be your only car because it works well on both short and long trips.

I disagree based both on personal anecdotal experience and data which is included in the post.    The likely result of the prevalence of the range anxiety myth is that as long as it remains pervasive, there are many for whom EVs may be appropriate who are scared off and don't take the time to evaluate it for their needs."
electricvehicles,2wnk0m,munky9002,1 point,Sat Feb 21 19:04:52 2015 UTC,There is an odd meme making the rounds in which EVs are disparaged because the typical EV has less range than a traditional ICE vehicle.    The problem is the average EV cannot drive across North america in the same timeline as a gasoline car.   Hybrids like the volt dont count. Tesla's superchargers dont count.
electricvehicles,2wnk0m,Nametab,2,Sat Feb 21 14:49:27 2015 UTC,"No, the problem is that while 80% of commutes are less than 60 miles, the occasional day of needing more range is what outweighs any benefits for most people.  I am a huge EV fan, but I am also a practical person:  We lease a Leaf and have a conventional car.  My wife drives the Leaf to work and we use it for most of our around town commutes. In the rare case she needs to go further than 65 miles in a day she takes my car. That ONLY works because I often work from home. If I had a commute of 90 miles every day and if she needed more range just 10% of the time, this arrangement wouldn't work.   Sadly it's that occasional need for more range that keeps most from adopting (at least on the US east coast with less quick charge infrastructure.) Once EVs can get 120-150 miles per charge for $30k car, the EV will see real mass adoption."
electricvehicles,2wnk0m,rmccle,2,Sat Feb 21 15:12:13 2015 UTC,I concur that 150+ range will make a huge difference. At 3.3kW level 2 you can get about that much range charging overnight. Combine that with DC fast charging on road trips and you are set. Can't wait for the Bolt.
electricvehicles,2wnk0m,dlip,1 point,Sat Feb 21 19:15:10 2015 UTC,I agree that more range will have a substantial impact dramatically increasing the addressable market.  In 2012 there were over 60 million autos produced - http://www.oica.net/category/production-statistics/2012-statistics/ - and over 16 million sold in the US so even a small percentage leads to a scalable level of production.  There are many (small percentage of a large number is still a large number) like you who are ready now.  The improvements in range and cost are moving forward increasing the addressable market faster than the current market saturates.

The crucial point is that the incentive is a tax credit, not a tax deduction, as /u/mobial seems to imply.    So if your tax liability is $8500 ($7500 already paid plus $1000 you still owe), you will get back the full $7500, in the form of a refund of $6500 ($1000 goes to the amount you still owe, and $6500 comes in a check from the IRS).  http://www.washingtonpost.com/cars/federal-tax-credits-for-plug-in-hybrids-electric-cars-what-you-need-to-know/2014/08/20/0ae02718-2886-11e4-8b10-7db129976abb_story.html"

There are WAY more to be had and everyone knows that the early adopters come first, then mainstream adoption   In Kansas City, Mo., for example, the main utility is building a network with more than 1,000 charging stations for the metropolitan area.  And in California, Pacific Gas and Electric recently became the last of California’s three big utilities to file a proposal with regulators that would allow it to install 25,000 public chargers — costing $654 million — in a state that has about 6,300 public chargers, at about 2,000 stations. In all, three major utilities envision building as many as 60,000 chargers in California in the coming years.   ohh... I see that's actually really cool. But yeah...

electricvehicles,2wg5gd,aarond12,3,Thu Feb 19 18:31:36 2015 UTC,"I think that it is currently difficult to make money off of EV chargers. Many companies that run charging networks have gone bankrupt or lack sufficient cash flows. Partnerships with manufactuers(like Nissan's no-charge-to-charge promotion) may help them to make a go of it in the short term. The problem is that many manufacturers are doing very little to encourage the installation of chargers.  Most electric vehicles charge using a SAE J1772 port. Some have a fast charging port that accepts DC current: Chademo, SAE Combo, Tesla.  There are 3 levels of charging: * Level 1: standard 110v AC outlet, 1.5kW, very very slow charging, but can be usable if you can reliably charge for 8-12 hours a day, but if the battery is completely empty it can take over 24 hours to recharge. Most EVs are sold with mobile adapter that connects 110v to SAEJ1772 * Level 2: 240v AC electrical lines powering an EVSE with a SAE J1772 plug providing 3-22kW. Charging times are normally in the range of 2-8 hours. Level 2 charging speed is limited by the power capacity of the vehicle's onboard charger. Typically this is 6-7kW in electric vehicle on the market. The Tesla Model S is the exception as it can handle 22kW. * Level 3: 20-135kW DC current which can charge vehicles to 80% in 20-30 minutes.   The vast majority of the time I charge my leaf at home at off peak rates for 7 cents per kWh and that works for the vast majority of my commuting.  There are about 20 public level 2 chargers in my city and 19 of them are free. One grocery store has a level 2 charger that costs .49 per kWh because they hate electric vehicle drivers obviously. I don't shop there.  There is a 50kW DC Chademo charger which can be used only by Nissan Leaf(with the fast charging option) & Kia Soul EV(not sold around here).  In my opinion it would only be worth it to pay for access to Level 3 charging because it offers speed and convenience whereas level 2 charging can be tedious unless the driver is otherwise occupied(eating, shopping, at a movie). For many businesses the cost of supplying power to level 2 stations may be worth it in order to attract affluent customers.  I have carried my own portable level 2 charger that plugs into an RV outlet to state parks a couple of times and gave the park $5 to cover the cost of the juice.  The problem with level 3 charging is that there is no widely accepted standard.  Chademo: Most chargers are 20-50kW, 100kW max? Used by Japanese & Korean automakers for the Leaf and Soul is widely installed in Japan, available in many west/east coast cities. Sparsely installed throughout the US making long distance trips difficult. Access and point of service payments handled through Blink, Chargepoint, and Others. These chargers will still take an hour or more to recharge a long range 200+mile EV.  SAE+Combo: Most chargers are 20-50kW, 100kW max? Only currently useful for the Bmw i3 and Chevy Spark. Very few chargers are currently installed in the US. Access and point of service payments handled through Blink, Chargepoint, and Others. These chargers will still take an hour or more to recharge a long range 200+mile EV.  Tesla Superchargers: 90-135kW Most prevalent level 3 charger with over 100 stations which each have 3-12 chargers. Only used by the Tesla Model S, access fees of $2k is paid upfront by vehicle buyers in order to provide capital for ongoing expansion of the network. Vehicle owners then have unlimited access to charge without additional fees for the life of the vehicle. Tesla has said they are open to allowing vehicles from other manufacturers use their network as long as those vehicles can fully utilize the high power levels and those owners also pay access fees upfront. These chargers can charge 200miles in 30-40minutes.  My leaf has a 24kW battery which provides 85miles of range. In 2016-2018 a new extended range Leaf will be released which offers 160-200 miles of range. The Tesla Model 3 will have 200+ miles of range. The Chevy Bolt will have 200+ miles of range. These next-gen vehicles with larger batteries will further reduce the value proposition of level 2 charging and make access to high powered 100+kW Level 3 chargers even more desirable.  tl;dr: EV charging is a mess. It is going to be difficult to make money and the current standards mess creates confusion and uncertainty which discourage investments."
electricvehicles,2wg5gd,paulwesterberg,3,Thu Feb 19 23:00:39 2015 UTC,"Have you contacted that grocery store about how .49 cents per kWh is outrageous? If I was the store I'd make it free as a way to get customers in the door. I mean come on....if someone shops for 30 minutes they might use like $0.50 of electricity. That's a small price to pay for a customer.    Edit: I've always thought of Level 2 chargers as something that businesses would install as a courtesy to their customers. As an EV owner, I'd obviously rather shop somewhere that offers a free charge."

electricvehicles,2wg5gd,sdoorex,1 point,Sat Feb 21 14:58:24 2015 UTC,"So right now installing DC chargers is a gamble because 50kW Chademo and SAE+Combo chargers could quickly become outdated and can only be used by a fraction of the EVs on the road. Tesla gives away supercharging access so good luck trying to get people to pay for that unless you have a super convenient  location.  Level 2 J1772 chargers are the only universal standard which can be used by all EVs but because it is so slow people will be unlikely to want to pay for access. I think the best way for a utility or charging network to make money off of these is to:   Charge businesses(Hotels, restaurants, shopping centers, movie theaters, golf courses, etc) for installation. The business attracts customers by offering the electricity for free. The utility makes money on selling a little more electricity. Charge networks make money by tracking customers."

electricvehicles,2wg5gd,robertbowerman,1 point,Fri Feb 20 04:26:23 2015 UTC,"One thing that I feel will jumpstart the adoption of EV's is the expansion of chargers to places where people actually park their cars for extended periods.  One of the biggest fears for people coming into the EV world is ""Where do I charge?""  The answer is... everywhere.  Chargers need to be ubiquitous.  That's why my proposal would be a credit or incentive of some sort to do the following three things:  Roll out a charging station/parking meter/lightpost system so that cars that have to park on-street can charge.  Encourage more employers to offer EV charging stations for their employees.  Incentivize companies to install multiple chargers for their customers.  The first of these ideas involves working with local governments and utilities.  The second is designed more for the traditional office than any other type of business.  Even with incentives, those two could be very slow to implement.  The third one, I feel, will be the fastest to roll out.  People spend a lot of time in retail stores.  While some places make more money based on foot traffic and turnover, some venues, like department stores, movie theaters, bars, and grocery stores, make more money the longer you're there.  When it comes to charging your car, time is an important factor.  Chargers for these companies can be an indirect source of revenue.  For example, let's say Target installs some EV chargers, Level 2.  My wife goes there, parks and charges while she shops.  After a half hour, she checks her phone and sees that the car is charging, but it could use a few more minutes.  She goes to the shoe section.  2 hours and 5 pairs of shoes later, she comes out to a full battery."
electricvehicles,2wg5gd,cleric3648,1 point,Fri Feb 20 13:39:11 2015 UTC,"The most impact would be a carbon fee. Any process that emits significant quantities of greenhouse gases would require paying a fee for the use of the atmosphere as a dumping ground. If the fee (often called a carbon tax) is set up to actually reflect the cost of the damage caused by releasing the CO2, gas prices would skyrocket, as would coal and natural gas. EVs emit less CO2, so they would instantly become the more affordable option, and sustainable sources of electricity would immediately become the preferred option for utilities.  The other thing to look at is local pollution. Burning gas emits fumes that are literally toxic, so strictly regulating those emissions makes sense, especially in densely populated areas.   The reason EVs are good from a public policy perspective is that they don't spew toxic gas and they are less damage to the global environment, so policies that prevent or reduce the spewing of toxic fumes and destruction of the environment will encourage EV adoption and innovation."

Plus they could just hire the right people to meet that criteria.  Engines aren't a problem either, especially if the vehicle is electric.  An electric car is just a computer on wheels.  I do agree that this is a massive undertaking, but maybe Apple realizes that the consumer device market is getting crowded, and they are looking to maintain their leader position, even if that means switching categories.  Last but not least, they are supposedly talking to Magna Steyr, which knows how to build cars (including electric cars).

electricvehicles,2w7pvf,jimmyh03,1 point,Wed Feb 18 03:54:04 2015 UTC,"Main thing to me is this. Does Apple really want to handle the hurdle of the full car lifecycle business? Sure they could probably throw a huge engineering army on the problem and produce a car. However being a car manufacturer means being a car warranty company, car repair shop, car parts shop, safety testing etc etc. All labour intensive and expensive businesses. Your serious failings would be measured in lost human lives, not in lost profits.  Cars aren't exactly a high margin business, even for the luxury brands.  Plus Apples brand is not associated with heavy machinery like cars. Sure Apple brand can sell anything related to consumer electronics and other household consumer products. However safety critical, big machines like a cars is a completely different area of specialty skills. Might as well say that Apple should get in the Cruise Ship building business, because they have the best brand in the world.  I agree with couple other posters. More likely is that apple is aiming for providing car UI's, dash board and infotainment electronics in partnership with the luxury car brands. That could involve 1000 engineers and designers. Apple has money to burn on extra staff.  Other possibility is Apple diversifying their financial base by buying a car company as a whole subsidiary. However at that point they would not rebrand the car as an ""Apple""-car, because the existing car company has better brand in the space of automotive business. Sure they would probably put Apple stamp and UI on the dash board info displays, but not in the front of the car.  For example buying Tesla and rebranding it as Apple would mean losing all of the buzz tesla has been creating over the last few years. Tesla is associated with speed, top safety ratings and comfort on the roads. Apple is associated with clean, nice and working UI's and top quality electronics parts. Apple executives are not stupid enough to lose half of the investment value to petty egoism.  Also energy saving on cars and phones are completely different problems. In computers it is about optimizing your circuits and code. On cars it is about optimizing your batteries temperature and chemistry, High voltage electronics, regenerative braking, electric motor efficiency curves, aerodynamics and your tires rubbers roll resistance physics. So Apple can probably make the most power efficient car infotainment system in the world. Sadly that is the least of the worries, when adding range to an electric car."

When they released the iPod, people said they were crazy and it would never work.  But not only did they make it work, they changed the way people get their music.  10 years ago, smartphones were... painful to use on a good day.  There was the Blackberry, and that was about it.  Then the iPhone came around.  Say what you will about it, but that was a dividing point in the phone industry.  Now, who doesn't have a smartphone?  5 years, tablet computers, same thing.  Before the iPad, no one knew what a tablet computer was.  Now, they're everywhere.  All of these, aside from the tablet, were existing industries that Apple had no business being in.  Now, they've been changed because of them.  Right now, EV's exist, to the masses, as either a toy for the rich or an eco-mobile powered by smugness.

electricvehicles,2w7pvf,madcuzimflagrant,1 point,Wed Feb 18 00:51:22 2015 UTC,"FYI I kind of just went on a trip down memory lane.  Feel free to ignore.   The iPod allowed people to take their entire music library anywhere. Portable MP3 players before it sucked. They had no battery life, no storage worth a damn, and the interfaces were designed by people with no thumbs.   I agree with your premise regarding Apple's commercial successes (and that an EV makes sense for them), but I do take some contention with the above point.  I started with the Rio PMP300 which was the first commercially successful mp3 player a full 3 years before the ipod was released.  The storage wasn't much but enough to compete with CDs.  The battery life wasn't bad but I used it quite a bit so I did drain it regularly. It used a single AA, so just having a couple rechargeables on rotation was plenty to get me through the week.    In 2000 (about a year before the ipod was announced) I upgraded to  2.5"" hard drive based mp3 player (neo jukebox).  I think it came with only a 6GB hard drive, but it was plug and play upgradeable (didn't even need a screwdriver) so I increased that quickly to a 20GB and eventually to a 30GB drive.  The battery was a decent Li-Ion, and while removable was charged by a regular charge cable connected to the device.  Interface was a really simply folder-based system.  I simply copied my entire library and then could easily navigate on the device using the original folder structure.  It came with a IR based remote which was great for hooking it up to speakers across the room.   It also worked as an easy file storage system which was really convenient as flash drives were tiny and expensive at the time.  It was a bit bulky and only had a blue backlit black LCD display, but it was unparalleled at the time.  Then 2003 got the Archos AV380 which was smaller than the Neo (although thicker and heavier than the ipod) and had a full color 3.8"" LCD screen.  It was pretty rugged with rubber corners and put up with a lot of abuse.  The controls were much more minimal and ergonomic, and as a comparison to ipods I often operated it with just one thumb.  It used a similar drag and drop, windows style folder system, but had what we would consider ""app"" categories today as the top level to access various features. By this time I think the ipod had finally started selling up to 40GB.  The AV380 not only had 80GB of storage, but it also was much more than just an MP3 player.  This baby did everything!   Audio video playback either on the device, on a TV, etc.  It could interface with everything and came with tons of accessories and cables.  Record from an accessory camera directly to the device.  It worked as a DVR to record A/V from TV, computers, whatever.  It had a card reader that took everything available at that time (which really saved me since SD cards were very limited then).  It had an IR attachment so it could also be used with a remote.  Honestly the only thing I disliked about it was the inability to easily remove the battery or HD.  It could be done, and I never actually needed to, but it was one sore spot for me.  The battery itself lasted plenty long, especially if you only used it for music.  All of those devices were awesome in their own right, but I'll admit to this day I've never met another person who had a Neo or Archos in that series.  Obviously they didn't go mainstream, and the Rio was an early version (and I don't know if that would even count as mainstream, probably not), but the point is that while I largely agree with you, there were indeed some beautiful alternatives both before and during the era of ipods.  I did eventually get an ipod Nano (which I loved because of the size) which lasted me until smart phones made it all irrelevant.  iTunes though... an absolute nightmare.  TL;DR  Yes, Apple largely did it better, and I agree this speaks to the logic of them developing an EV by successfully shifting/expanding their core competency.  There were, however, some really impressive media players that while not nearly as popular as the iPod, are certainly deserving of recognition."

electricvehicles,2w2gbn,Snugglosaurus,5,Mon Feb 16 11:35:53 2015 UTC,"I assume you've already seen the movie ""Who Killed the Electric Car"", which has interesting details on what I consider to be the birth of the modern electric car era in the late 1990s.  Even though those cars were taken off the market and destroyed, except for some of the Toyota RAV4 EVs, they proved that electric cars were viable and they paved the way for Tesla to step in and show just how viable they could be with the Roadster using Lithium Ion batteries.    You could also write to a fellow named Jack Rickard, who was involved in the EV conversion hobby in the early 2000s and did one of the first lithium conversions I saw.  Jack's other claim to fame was his magazine BoardWatch which covered the evolution of Bulletin Board Services in the 80s and early 90s before the internet.  The key to the viability of the electric car is obviously the battery, and a story of the evolution of the EV has to also be a history of the battery that powers it.  That first generation of modern viable EVs were enabled by large format Nickle Metal Hydride (NiMH)batteries and the current crop of EVs are enabled by Lithium Ion batteries.   Back in the early 1990s, I was an engineer at a D.C. TV station and had some experience with the AGM batteries that our camera crews/reporters used to power their camera, lights, wireless mics, etc.  The batteries were heavy and could only power a camera with a light for a few minutes, and they needed to be replaced often.  We used batteries that attached to the back of the camera, and battery belts.  A battery belt was able to power a camera and a small light kit for a half hour or so.    At some point, we purchased a new system from Anton Bauer that used these new NiMH batteries.  These new batteries were the same size as the old batteries, and they weighed the same.  However, the small battery that attached to the back of the camera was now able to power that camera and the same small light kit for the same amount of time that the battery belt did.  We ended up discarding the belt and went exclusively with the camera batteries.  This experience put a bug in my head, that's kind of still there.  I estimated that the energy contained in the new NiMH batteries we had was about 3-5 times more per volume and weight than the AGM batteries they replaced.  A few years later, I knew about California's zero emission vehicle mandate, and I was passively following GM's EV1 program.  I knew that GM was using lead acid batteries for their first cars, and I wondered why they didn't use the kick ass batteries that my camera crews were using.  I was disappointed that nothing became of GM's EV program with the repeal of California's law, and was later outraged when I saw Who Killed the Electric Car.  In the early 2000s, I relocated home to Cincinnati, and I began to very strongly look into converting a car to electric.  My cousin and close friend is a car mechanic, and between the two of us we had the necessary skill and equipment to do a car.  I avidly read the postings at the DIY Electric Car Forum, and looked at their member's conversions.  I had done my math, specified my components, and was on the lookout for a donor car.  Unfortunately, work and travel requirements did not permit me to actually pull the trigger, but I was able to finally purchased a Volt last year.  The batteries that I wanted to use at first were the NiMH batteries that I had used back in D.C., but they were not available.  The only real option was Lead Acid batteries.  My car would not have been a practical car.  The suspension of the donor car would have to be modified to accommodate the ton of batteries, the range would have been only 30-35 miles, and the battery would need to be replaced every 3 or 4 years.    When I was looking for batteries, I saw these large format Lithium Iron Phosphate cells out of China from Thundersky and Valkyrie that weren't really available and were unbelievably expensive.  However, on paper, Lithium batteries were even better than the NiMH batteries I had wanted to use.  They were just as energy dense or more, but were 1/4 the weight.  When I plugged the numbers into my calculations for my conversion car using those batteries, suddenly my 30 mile range car was going 80-100 miles between charges.  The number of charge cycles was 3x that of my lead acid pack and was getting me 3x as far per charge.  I realized that this battery was going to last the lifetime of my conversion car!  The icing on the cake was that it was light enough that I wouldn't have to modify the suspension on the donor car.  On the DIY Electric Car Forum, a number of people were talking about these unobtainable lithium cells from China.  One fellow had contacted Thundersky to inquire about selling them in the US.  The members of the forum decided to pool their money and do a bulk purchase.  One person received the cells, split the shipment up, and sent them to the other members who had gone in on the purchase.  Eventually, they became more available and the prices dropped.  Around this time, I heard about this internet billionaire that was building a rocket in the desert to win some NASA X prize, who was also going to build an EV using Lithium batteries.  I decided to follow this guy's progress, and still am today.  When he comes out with his affordable EV in a few years, I think I'm going to buy one.  Things I would like to know more about are these early Chines lithium batteries.  There's information buried in the DIY Electric Car Forum, including emails from folks from Thundersky and Valkyrie.  In there is analysis of manufacturer claims, there's disappointment with Valkyrie under performance and quality, and pleasant surprise at Thundersky under specifying the capabilities of their cells."

electricvehicles,2w2gbn,mburke6,1 point,Tue Feb 17 00:54:54 2015 UTC,"I now own a Chevy Volt, which I purchased used last year.  I love my Volt, but I don't really think of it as a hybrid, but rather as two separate cars.  I do a lot of traveling between Cincinnati and Washington D.C., one or two trips per month.  When I'm in Cincinnati, I use almost no gas, when I'm in DC, I use almost no gas.  When I'm traveling between, I'm in a gas car that gets me 40-44 MPG.  The official MPG rating on the Volt is 38, but I use the battery to help get me up the mountains in West Virginia. I can eek out a few more MPG by strategically using the battery.  I was excited to see GM get back into the EV market when they first announced they were developing the Volt and have been following that development too.  In my opinion, the first two electric cars that could practically serve as you're one and only car were the Tesla Model S and the Chevy Volt.  The Leaf is perfect as a 2nd commuter car and there will always be a huge market for that, but for most people, it requires either the owner to either have access to a 2nd vehicle.  In my excitement to own an affordable EV, I actually tried to reserve a Leaf on the day it was possible to do so.  Cost $99 to reserve and was refundable.  Unfortunately it was not available in Cincinnati at that time.  My plan was to keep my old Subaru for commutes to DC, and the Leaf for when I was home.    While I would rather own a Model S, for my driving needs, the Volt is more practical at this moment in time.  When, and I should emphasize the word when, Tesla develops a 300 to 400 mile battery pack for the Model S/X or the Model 3, then that car would also be perfectly suitable to meet my regular 520 mile driving needs.  Tesla and GM/Bob Lutz had different solutions for dealing with the limitations of current battery technology.  Tesla's solution was to put an enormous and expensive battery in their car and sell it to the luxury market, create an income stream, and use that to develop the technology to eventually make EVs cheaper for the mass market.  Bob Lutz's realized that the average daily commute for Americans was around 30 to 40 miles.  His plan was to develop an EV that would satisfy most people's daily driving needs while providing a gasoline generator for those times when 40 miles was not enough.    Both plans were and are brilliant.  Tesla's plan is more long term and will eventually win out as battery technology evolves.  GM's plan could produce more immediate results if they decide to actually market their 2nd generation Volt and really mass produce it.  They also need to expand the Volt drivetrain technology to other vehicles, ala VIA Motors.  Tesla will always have a special place in my heart for showing (up) the car manufacturers that there is pent up demand for EVs.  Without the Tesla Roadster, I doubt very much there would be a Volt.  I resent GM for dismantling their EV program in the early 2000s and especially for selling their controlling share of GM Ovonics to Chevron, who stopped production on the large format NiMH batteries that I first wanted to use in my EV conversion."
electricvehicles,2w2gbn,autonicus,3,Tue Feb 17 02:06:58 2015 UTC,"As you have probably discovered, many of the companies who have tried to crack the commercial market failed. (see Modec, Bright Automotive, Navistar e-star, Echo) Some are still out there (Emerald, Boulder, XL Hybrids, Odyne). Then there are companies involved in the public transport side (BAe Systems, Allison Transmission, Proterra). Some interesting general background on EV history to date can be found here. In a nutshell here is my view of the commercial/fleet market. First, while the commercial fleet market market offers several theoretical advantages over consumer market (predictable routes, central charging, focus on operating costs), there are also several problems. Fleets will not pay one dime more for EV's over diesel/gas/natural gas solutions. HEV's and PEV's need to contribute to the bottom line - at the moment they do not Also, fleets need to know a given vendor is going to be around - with so many failed companies littering the roadside, a fleet operator would be crazy to commit to buying a significant number of units from a company that could be bankrupt in the next year. Now, the good news is that fleets ARE increasingly interested in looking at EV solutions, but there are not many vendors to choose from. Expect the market to grow slowly. One of the vehicles to watch would be Nissan's e-NV200 delivery van. The holy grail would be if a major government customer e.g. the Post Office would commit to buying x numbers of vehicles over a period of time creating a stable demand that would attract investors. Hope this helps!"

Via Motors with Bob Lutz is doing something interesting for the commercial fleet market.  I think they're going to succeed too.  They are partnering with GM to provide Volt style plug-in hybrid trucks and vans.  They use GM vehicles and will install their own hybrid drive train.  The trucks are a little more expensive than stock, but they save enough on fuel, brakes, and general wear and tear on the gas engine that they quickly pay for themselves.  They've been working on this for a few years now, and the video I linked to was their first prototype.  They've just now begun to deliver."

At least 58 EV1 drivers sent letters and deposit checks to GM, requesting lease extensions at no risk or cost to the automaker. The drivers reportedly agreed to be responsible for the maintenance and repair costs of the EV1, and would allow GM the right to terminate the lease if expensive repairs were needed. On June 28, GM famously refused the offer and returned the checks, which totaled $22,000; By contrast, Honda, which had taken similar actions with its EV+ program, agreed to extend its customers' leases.[17]   The offer sounds reasonable, and Honda accepted it.   why did literally no other manufacturer even TRY to come out with one for 20 more years?   They thought the market was too small considering the cost and limitations. Also, there was an issue with the patent of the best battery tech.  They didn't make a serious effort to determine the potential market, but it's easy to understand their lack of interest considering the potential risk.  I am pleased that GM made a serious effort in developing the EV1."

All the cars you named, in their current generations at least, are ~100 mile city cars. The only rumblings we've heard of moving up to the 200 mile level are the Chevy Bolt, and rumors about the next gen Nissan Leaf.

When you over volt the motor you will create lots of heat which is power loss. You will significantly reduce your range with relatively small power gains.

My lease requires that I get all recommended services performed by a Ford dealer at the recommended intervals.   The annual services Ford requires are:   Rotate tires, inspect tire wear and measure tread depth. Perform multi-point inspection (recommended). Inspect brake pads, shoes, rotors, drums, brake linings, hoses and parking brake. Inspect cooling system level, strength and hoses. Inspect half-shaft boots. Inspect steering linkage, ball joints, suspension and tie-rod ends. Lubricate if equipped with grease fittings. Inspect wheels and related components for abnormal noise, wear, looseness or drag.

electricvehicles,2vhb8l,Kakkerlak,1 point,Thu Feb 12 00:47:48 2015 UTC,"I do worry about the single-speed transaxle a little.     The single-speed transmission is in theory very simple;  there are far fewer wear parts like clutches and synchros compared to a conventional transmission, and the lubrication system is sealed for life;  there's no fluid port or filter that are easily serviceable and there is no scheduled maintenance for the transmission.  But it does carry quite a bit of stress in both directions;  all that force that's not being taken by friction brakes right at the wheel is passing back through the transaxle as you run regenerative braking.  And these are very low-volume parts.   When you build a million transmissions you have more opportunity to engineer out the problems.  When you build maybe 10,000 of them total, they never really get out of beta test stage.   Many EV enthusiasts don't remember that the Tesla Roadster nearly died in infancy, with three transmission suppliers trying and failing before it hit the road.  That's a major reason why I leased my Focus Electric instead of purchasing it outright.    The battery technology will advance, and nobody's sure about the resale value, but really it's because I don't want to be the guy who determines the time to failure for a novel transmission."

Whether or not my next electric is a Ford depends on what's on the market when my lease is up in late 2017.  The main problem I've heard about the Focus Electric has been that they've had wiring harness and subsystem firmware bugs that resulted in the infamous 'Stop Safely Now' fault.   There have been a small number of bad batteries that required replacement.   But overall, Ford has taken these issues in stride.   They don't publish how many they've had to take back as lemons, but one yardstick on that is that a single dealer in Missouri buys the repairable lemons and they seem to sell a half-dozen a month.      You'll still see one or two people a month on the MyFocusElectric forum who get the 'SSN' fault.   But then you're probably seeing a large number of the total extant SSN faults on that Forum, while folks with normally operating cars just keep driving them.  The main complaints I have about the Focus Electric are the power-hungry defroster and the bugs and weaknesses I've had with MyFord Sync.     I knew about the heater system going in, but optimistically figured I wouldn't need it and could charge every other day.  Nope;  I get too close to a depleted battery if I skip a charge day.   This is a minimal problem because I have free charging at work.  The infotainment system on my particular car has had an intermittent problem where it doesn't turn off for about 30 minutes after I switch the car off, and a few times it has actually turned on and I've come out to the car in the morning to find the radio playing at full volume.   I did get a notice the other day that I'm eligible for a bug-fix warranty update of the Ford Sync system, but I haven't gone in yet to have it done.  I, and many other drivers, have gripes about the power information displays and the ""Guess-O-Meter"".  For me that's also partially because I work in industrial design and have opinions on how to communicate technical machine data at a glance.  I still love stopping at a light with the windows down, listening to and smelling the ICE engines all around me, then zooming off silently down the road."
electricvehicles,2vchh5,387498231,3,Mon Feb 9 21:58:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's great that they're investing in EV infrastructure, but I'm not at all convinced this is the best way to be spending all that money. The article says they're planning 25,000 level 2 stations, and 100 DC fast chargers. But, are all those L2 stations really going to get used? And is 100 fast chargers really enough?  Most people charge at home or at work, and rarely use public charging stations, and with the advent of the Bolt and the Model 3, public chargers will be even less important. The one exception to all this is that DC fast chargers can enable long-distance travel which would otherwise be impractical, so I wish they were planning a slightly higher DC/L2 ratio."
electricvehicles,2vchh5,Halfworld,2,Tue Feb 10 02:16:28 2015 UTC,"As someone who lives in an apartment (many do), this is a welcome announcement. I'd happily buy a Leaf if public charging were more prevalent. My gas guzzling and aging Audi is going to die on me some day and I badly need to get a new car, but haven't been able to justify a Leaf despite living in a place that could possibly have the highest density of chargers in the US - Silicon Valley. This is only because my family and friends live about 50 miles away in Santa Cruz, where there are zero fast chargers. I'm leaning toward a used leaf which means a reduced capacity battery. This all together probably makes me a weird case, so all I can really say is that if there were more chargers a Leaf would be much more viable for me.  I just hope Santa Cruz gets a few fast chargers.  Edit: I realize you're saying more fast chargers would be good and certainly I agree! I guess I'm just saying that for apartment dwellers public charging is important. I guess L2 is just way cheaper. DC chargers are like $12k."

As it stands, the median household can only benefit from $5,271 of the current Tax Credit (Married filing jointly, $53,891 median income, $12,600 deduction).  Increasing the tax credit to $10k would only benefit the richer members of society (dual income households making more than $68,750, the to 38%), with the maximum benefit only coming to households who make more than $85k/year (top 28%, making about 60% more than the median household).  On the other hand, as a Rebate, anybody could benefit from it.  Only make $34k/year (the bottom third of households)?  Then the additional $10k would be more than 4 times the savings on a new Leaf.  That would drop is effective cost to such a family from around $33k down to about $25k.  That's a huge difference for the people who could most benefit from it.

Regardless, GM is sitting on a lot of unsold Volts."

electricvehicles,2ucl2x,coolislandbreeze,8,Sat Jan 31 22:43:24 2015 UTC,"I hope this type of post is acceptable. I'm obviously brand new at this and I'm just so excited I have to share it with somebody.  The reason the hood looks ajar is because it is. The batteries have been replaced with extra-capacity (higher amp-hour) ones which are about an inch taller. I'll get it fixed. Just have to move the capacitor back a few inches, hopefully. Might need to shave down a corner of it as well. It really doesn't get too hot.  Happy to answer any questions!"
electricvehicles,2ucl2x,ViperRT10Matt,10,Sat Jan 31 22:45:21 2015 UTC,"Well, seeing as how I had never heard of one of these before your post, I welcome it.  I did some googling and it looks like stock, this car is limited to 35 mph. However, given that you have swapped out the batteries, I'm guessing you might have done some other mods as well that may affect top speed. Is that the case?  What does one of these set one back these days?"
electricvehicles,2ucl2x,ViperRT10Matt,11,Sat Jan 31 23:10:05 2015 UTC,"I bought it from a local EV enthusiast. He buys them in poor shape and rehabs them for a new life. There are a few mods, but nothing huge.  Headlights are now the high intensity (lower consumption) variety. From the factory, they only run 25mph, but here in Washington State, it's legal to mod them to 35, and this has been done.  I'm planning on adding a jump seat for two more passengers in the back, since I have kids. The body is actually from France, it's a MicroCar MC2 (over there it's a diesel, but Zenn just bought them without powertrain for conversion.) The French version is available with a back seat.  What did it set me back? Hold on to your butt... $3,000."

electricvehicles,2ucl2x,Aquareon,5,Sat Jan 31 23:25:06 2015 UTC,"The battery upgrade is an interesting one. They're slightly bigger which means more amp-hours (longer range,) but the voltage remains 72, so it doesn't change the speed or acceleration. There are four batteries under the back floor panel, which fit nicely (even the bigger ones) in the space previously reserved for the gas tank. The two under the hood, however, are just barely too big. I'll work on that.  All the outside body panels are painted plastic. The floor pan is carbon fiber. The pillars and frame cage are all aluminum. You can see why it was such an expensive car.  It has four-wheel disc brakes, but they're smaller than what you'd find on a motorcycle. It has regenerative braking, but it seems like kind of a waste since you never really develop much speed in the first place.  Curb weight has been variously reported at 1,270 to 1,400. It's a very efficient little car."
electricvehicles,2ucl2x,Aquareon,3,Sat Jan 31 23:36:40 2015 UTC,Are the upgraded batteries also lead acid? Is there anyway to get a denser chemistry in there?
electricvehicles,2ucl2x,greenskyx,8,Sat Jan 31 23:38:07 2015 UTC,"Excellent question!  Yes, they are still sealed lead acid, but these are the ones typically used as the backup universal power supply at hospitals. The seller works in facilities management at a hospital and said he got ""a good deal"" on them, but strangely didn't have paperwork, so draw your own conclusion from that.  YES! You can upgrade the batteries in any way you want, depending on your budget and stomach for adventure.  The best bang:buck ratio would be electric power tool lithium ion batteries. They give far better performance, far longer life, have greater power density (so you can go lighter, or stay the same weight with vastly improved capacity.)  If you wanted to take it a step further, you could actually pack way more of them in since they are smaller and easier to fit in odd places, so you could up the weight a tad and get a LOT more.  Problem is the cost. Six lead acid batteries are going to cost $600-900 for the set, depending how nice you want to go. You could go quite a bit higher if you wanted, but once you get past a Sears Diehard, there's really not much room for improvement.  Conversely, a lithium ion retrofit will cost:   Easily $3,000+ for the batteries. Think $80 each for something slightly bigger than your fist times an awful lot of them. The cost of retrofitting the battery compartments. If you're handy and have the tools, this could be less than $100, but if you need it done by a professional, it's going to cost a mint. Testing and understanding how to wire in series/sequence so you still end up with 72v. Anything else will cause problems. May also need to change out your heat monitoring system, since it's Lithium Ion batteries have different thresholds and you don't want to set your car on fire.   Once the Tesla Gigafactory comes online, the batteries may become less of a cost prohibitive issue, but for now, this is strictly a neighborhood car.  Also, it charges exclusive via extension cord, which is the very slowest charge possible. 4 hrs can get you to 60-80%, but a full charge is going to be 8hrs on average. Perfect if you can plug in at work and at home, less ideal unless your commute is under 10 miles."
electricvehicles,2ucl2x,Aquareon,2,Sat Jan 31 23:51:32 2015 UTC,"Why on Earth would you use power tool batteries when inside of those are standard 18650 cylindrical cells you can build a conventional battery pack from? Moreover, for a vehicular application why not use large format Thunder Sky rectilinear cells?"
electricvehicles,2ucl2x,finally_joined,2,Mon Feb 9 01:27:41 2015 UTC,I'm very new at this. I know nothing about making such a huge change... yet.
electricvehicles,2ucl2x,ViperRT10Matt,2,Mon Feb 9 01:39:44 2015 UTC,"No worries, but don't go making such recommendations until you know more, or it's the blind leading the blind. If you can find an EV specialist business nearby, they will often do battery replacement, they just take ages to get it done as they're the only game in town or close.   The car's motor and controller don't care where the power comes from, you can drop a pack of Thunder Sky LiFEPO4 cells in there (what I recommend, for the high cycle life) and all you need to change is the charger. Typically when you buy a pack of large format cells it comes with a charger tailored to it. I strongly recommend a BMS (battery management system) as well, if the cell supplier offers it as an option.   This keeps all cells at the same charge level. Otherwise they gradually grow more imbalanced, eventually damaging the lowest and highest charged cells during full discharge and full charging respectively. If the supplier doesn't offer a BMS there exist economical aftermarket BMS kits you can have your EV specialist install for you.  Doing this with large format cells will cost vastly less than what you calculated. Power tool batteries have a cost premium because they are in proprietary casing that fits that brand of tools. If you buy OEM cells, whether 18650 or large format in sufficient numbers to meet the voltage the car expects, I guarantee it won't cost so much. $3,000 for an NEV lithium pack would be insanity. I have a 4kwh electric scooter that does 50mph for ~30 miles, 40 on a warm day and the whole thing cost $3,500."
electricvehicles,2ucl2x,WC_EEND,4,Mon Feb 9 02:11:08 2015 UTC,"TOTALLY acceptable. I saw one of these a few years ago in a parking lot, but I've never known someone who owns one. What sort of range does it have? What sort of driving do you plan on doing with it?"
electricvehicles,2ucl2x,ACDRetirementHome,4,Sun Feb 1 07:33:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know the actual practical range yet, since I've only had it since Friday night, but it looks to be pretty terrible. Maybe 16-20 miles. I plan to use it for all my in-town driving. Store runs, local errands and what not.  Yesterday I went to Starbucks, 7-11, Lowes and AutoZone. That used up almost half my charge, but the charge monitor isn't the most reliable, so it's tough to say."
electricvehicles,2ucl2x,greenskyx,2,Sun Feb 1 21:24:25 2015 UTC,"That range really is abysmal. On par with the Zapp Xebra although imo the Zenn is far nicer looking. If I were so inclined, I'd prefer it to a GEM or something if only because it's properly weather proof.  Those lead acid batteries are gonna grate on you. I limped along with an ebike powered by agm SLAs for a long time. The low replacement cost kept seducing me. But if you do the math, lithiums are way cheaper in the long run because of the vastly greater cycle life."
electricvehicles,2ucl2x,greenskyx,2,Tue Feb 10 00:52:46 2015 UTC,"The Gem is really well built, but it's not what I'd call a car. The Zapp Xebra also doesn't really look like a car. I'm not sure I'm secure enough to drive one of those in public. ;)  Now having over a week of driving it, I'd say the range is closer to 16 than 20 miles. It gets up to the limited 35mph nicely though.  I looked into a Lithium conversion, and while it could save money over the normal life of a car, this car isn't expected to have a normal life. Since I can't use it to replace anything but in-town driving, the miles aren't going to rack up very quickly.  What I have now is six 150Ah lead acid batteries. You can buy drop in replacement Lithium Ion batteries that fit the same size, but only up to 100Ah, and those are over a thousand dollars each. I don't see making the conversion until they come down quite a bit.  But in the mean time, I'm having a blast driving it."

electricvehicles,2ucl2x,raleel,5,Sat Jan 31 23:12:08 2015 UTC,"All of them came from the factory governed at 25mph, but I've never heard of one that hasn't been modified to 35 or 43. Chews through the battery a bit quicker, but it's worth it to not get run over.  The company bought 500 MicroCar MC2s from France without engines, transmissions or gas tanks and retrofitted them in Canada to all-electric. They have 6 lead acid batteries which the manufacturer claimed would give a 50-mile range.  You'd have to start at the top of a mighty big mountain to get 50 miles though. I've never heard of anyone getting more than 20-30, and I suspect my range (without hills) is closer to 18 or 20.  In France, the 50cc diesel isn't actually licensed as a car, but a quadricycle. Didn't even realize a car could be emasculated until I read that.  I can post some interior pictures tomorrow. It's shockingly roomy inside."
electricvehicles,2ua3b0,lowfoam,8,Sat Jan 31 05:34:01 2015 UTC,"Get a Chevy Volt and see how you like that. It will give you ~40 miles on batteries and the rest on gas. It's a first step that won't break the bank. The first round of pure electric cars that would fit your lifestyle are still a year or two away. Get a Volt and save up for the Chevy Bolt or the Tesla Model 3.   As far as pure electric. Maintenance is hugely less than Gas. Less components means less things to break. Also, with regenerative braking, you won't have to replace your brakes as often. I believe Tesla covers all drive train repairs for free for the first 10 years (Not sure if parts and labor, or just parts). This is for the S, not sure if that will be true on the Model 3.  Insurance, I am not sure, but I think it is insured like any other car. It is based on value and safety rating (Tesla S has highest safety rating ever, and the Model 3 will probably also be very high).  Tax Breaks- Yes, there is a $7500 Federal tax break, and each state varies for their own incentives (some don't have any).  Hope this helps."
electricvehicles,2ua3b0,JulsJunior,2,Sat Jan 31 06:00:49 2015 UTC,"It helps a little bit, thank you!   Yeah, I think that gas / electric hybrids - the more I look at them anyway - are what I'll have to go for. Long commutes = not very good right now unless I wanna drop 80K for a tesla.   Weirdly enough, I've been a conservative breaker, so I don't replace breaks. My Taurus was given to me with new breaks, and it's been 3 years and so far, no harm, no foul. I did, however, warp the rotor because of going up and down so many hills - sucks living in a mountain region!   I believe another factor with insurance is how likely a car is to get stolen. I don't have any tickets or accidents under my license, and I'd like to keep it that way.   So any car I buy - brand new - we'll say the price tag is a solid 30,000. I would apply for the tax break and get 7.5k back? In the end, the car would only cost me ~22.5k  I'm sensing that there are limitations and model exceptions to this. (And not to mention loan and all of that interest and stuff).   But thank you very much!"
electricvehicles,2ua3b0,theyear1989,1 point,Sat Jan 31 06:41:39 2015 UTC,"The tax break is a maximum of $7500. So, if you tax bill is only $5000, you only get a $5000 credit."
electricvehicles,2ua3b0,Lonelan,5,Wed Feb 4 23:34:55 2015 UTC,"I switched to electric when my commute became ~65 miles round trip. I bought a Chevy Spark EV, which advertised 84 miles. In the traffic I drive in, my range was closer to 100.  Distance  Leaf, Spark, Fiat, whichever electric you get, driving habit is the determiner for range. Drive towards the car's top speed, accelerate/decelerate quickly, change speed often, and you'll get a lower range. I've gotten careless now that my commute is only ~45 miles, and I average 4.7 miles per kWh, and my car has a 21 kWh battery. There was 0 traffic on my way to work yesterday and I stayed at around 80mph, and I got to work with a 3.8 mi/kWh average. Almost all electrics out there are at this ""~80 mile range"" point, except for the Mitsubishi iMiEV which is at ~60.   Charging  Not sure of your living situation, but if you have a garage you can get a ""Level 2"" charger for ~$600 that plugs into a 240v socket. If your garage is near the laundry for the house, most electric dryers use the same socket. As long as you don't run both at the same time you won't trip the circuit. Charging at the workplace is a community thing. E-mail lists and aggressive courtesy helps keep things smooth, so ask around and see what the situation is at your workplace. If you're looking for ""what if I get stranded"" charging, checkout www.plugshare.com for a look at what the public chargers in your area are like for availability. Here is a website with various level 2s for sale http://www.clippercreek.com/  Repairs  There are none. Electric motors are a completely closed system, mostly contactless. No oil, no fluids, nothing to change. You'll have to rotate tires, probably have your AC checked out, and brakes/tires. Brakes even not so much since the electric motor is used to brake unless you have to stop quicker than the motor will allow. The one thing you have to look after is the battery. Most dealers come with an 8 year, 100,000 mile battery warranty that guarantees a certain % of the battery still usable at that time. The batteries are mostly lithium ion and they will degrade. Leaf has been around the longest so there's good data about how that battery reacts. It also has passive cooling, where airflow cools the battery when in use. Others have active cooling, where the battery is in an anti-freeze like solution and it will kick on the HVAC to cool the battery if it gets too hot, or the heater if it gets too cold. Active cooling helps the battery last longer, supposedly. I've driven mine for about 30k miles and I've lost maybe 5% of my total capacity. The most I've spent on a repair is when my windshield got hit a couple weeks ago and got a big crack in it. Not really an ""EV"" thing.  Money  My car, Chevy Spark EV, sticker is 28k. Base model Leaf is 29k. If you lease (I highly recommend, better cars are coming quickly), the Leaf is a great start. Get one of the higher cost models (32k or 35k), as they come with quick charging (Level 3 DC charging, 0-80% in ~30-45 minutes). There is a $7,500 federal tax credit involved with EVs right now. Some states (like CA) have a rebate. CA is $2,500. As in, you buy an EV that you're going to keep for at least 36 months, and they'll send you a check for $2,500. This goes for leasing or buying. The federal tax credit goes to whoever purchases the car. For leases, that means the bank gets the tax credit. Which is good, because they can generally use the full credit and will take that much off of the sticker price to hit the residual value. Insurance depends on cost of the vehicle, model type, etc, so electrics don't get any special consideration as far as that goes.  Which one to choose  One guy suggested a Volt. For that you're gonna have to wait for the 2016 model, it's just too much of an upgrade to pass up. Originally I was going to say the Volt is much too expensive, but it looks like they dropped the 2015 to $34k starting sticker. It's not an entry level for this kind of stuff, it's more of a ""I have a significant commute and travel long distances frequently"" sort of thing. Plus their cost is much higher than most pure EVs and newer plug-in hybrids. Also, lease if you can. Nissan advertises a $200/mo lease with $2.4k down for the Leaf. If you never have to drive more than 100 miles, or can take public transportation instead, I would highly suggest that car.   2nd option: Ford C-Max Energi. http://www.ford.com/cars/cmax/trim/energi/  Or a Volt. http://www.chevrolet.com/volt-electric-car.html  You've got a 50 mile commute so the Energi would almost cover half of that on electric, where the Volt would cover most of it. The Volt qualifies for all of the federal tax credit though, whereas the C-Max only qualifies for ~$4k. Also, in CA, the rebate is only $1,500 for plug-in hybrids.   But yeah, location location location. If you live in a hilly area and are alone on the road going to and from work, and you routinely use the heater or AC, you'll get closer to 60 miles of range than 80. If you're like me and are in a mostly flat, urban area with lots of traffic you'll hit 100 miles of range. I live in San Diego and the furthest I've taken my car is Disneyland in Anaheim, was about 65 miles one-way. We drove up there, parked at the city hall which had free parking for EVs, walked the mile or so to the park, played around for 6 or so hours, came back to a fully charged car and drove on home. Long trips are possible, it just takes planning. The only people EV doesn't work for are those who routinely drive 110+ mile one way trips where renting a car or public transportation isn't an economical option. If you don't do that...take the plunge."
electricvehicles,2ua3b0,thetofuprincess,2,Sat Jan 31 17:30:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything this guy said. I drive a Leaf (also in San Diego). One thing to add is the unexpected cost of dealing with tech that just isn't that popular yet. If you don't own a house, dealing with daily charges can be challenging. I've been working with my apartment complex since July on getting my car reliably charged up after their swapped their charge policy without much warning (went from a community charger to a personal one from a company my apartment complex requires I use  that is not very on top of things and loses my account info a lot). It's totally workable, but a lot of extra hassle and time that has soured the joyful experience of my economical and environmentally responsible bundle of leafy joy a little bit. :)"

electricvehicles,2ua3b0,whatsomattau,4,Tue Feb 3 23:54:25 2015 UTC,"I have had the Mercedes B-Class electric for almost two months now. I love it! A friend of mine at work went electric, and I followed her lead. I am not necessarily a ""green"" person, but I am developing a smugness as I drive around in my car looking at all of the exhaust come out of others'  cars and knowing mine isn't contributing any. We went with the MBZ because (1) it was roomy inside [I've got three kids, though they mostly don't ride with me]; (2) the dealer was right up the street from us [about three miles]; and (3) it contains some Tesla parts. We also looked at the Volkswagen e-Golf, but they just didn't want to deal with us like Mercedes was willing to. I love Volkswagen normally. I have only really ever driven one. But, we had a GREAT experience at Mercedes. (And now I feel like a ""real"" adult driving around in one.) Anyway, to address some of your concerns:  *My insurance only went up $3 a month going to the MBZ B-Class from a Volkswagon Passat wagon.  *Yes, it is rude to park all day in a charging spot; most have a limit of 4 hours. So, I agree with another poster who said to park there in the AM, and then move your car at lunch. (I only have to drive six miles round trip to work, so I don't even charge my car everyday.) You'll discover, too, how irked you get when you see REGULAR gas cars parking in an EV spot! SO RUDE!  *My maintenance calls for only one visit a year. I'm not sure what they do at that visit, but there's no ""engine"" like a regular car, so there's no costs for oil or fluids like that. Maybe they'll top up my windshield washer fluid, and look at the air filter for the AC, something like that. I LOVE that I haven't had to wait in the long lines for gas at Costco in over a month!  *You might consider leasing? Normally my husband and I purchase our cars, but with the electric technology changing so greatly, we didn't want to purchase when, in three years when the lease is up, there will be so many more options as far as drive range, etc. Even leasing and living in California, we got a $2500 check back from the state. We are also able to apply for the $7500 tax rebate, but it probably won't work for us because we usually always get a refund.   *We did install a home charger. Even driving as little as I do, it has helped alleviate some of my ""range anxiety"". It charges so quickly! Also, if you do go the electric car route, look into getting reduced rates from your electricity company. We're eligible for that here in CA. The price goes down overnight, which is when I'd be charging my car anyway.  Good luck with your decision!"

I don't see myself getting one for maybe ~5 years or so. I have student loans I want to pay down, but my credit is excellent, so I'm happy about that.   I'm hoping that if I move back to the area I live in now, I'll move to another that's eco friendlier. I mean, Tesla's got an awesome charging-building plan coming to fruition soon. Imagine if there was a charging station like Starbucks - I'd die a happy person, I'll tell you that!   That's good, with the repair. There's a ton more expensive things that go wrong with a regular gas car. My dad is a mechanic, and he's fixed most of them, but if he hadn't been there, my car probably would've cost me a solid 3k in repairs now. :c   And that's sad to hear about the tax break! Out of curiosity, do I have to live in the US for an entire year to become eligible for it? I pan on teaching overseas, and I have to be absent 330 days out of the year to be exempt from taxes stateside.

electricvehicles,2ua3b0,coolislandbreeze,1 point,Mon Feb 2 17:53:58 2015 UTC,"You should consider a used Volt. They can be found for $12,000 and that can tide you over until you make a new car purchase in five years. Plus, you won't have to worry about figuring out all the tax rebates. Also, with the Volt, all you really need is to plug it into a standard 110 V household outlet overnight to fully charge it, so no additional installation of a garage charger is necessary.  Since the Volt has a ~40 mile electric range and a 340 mile gas tank, you can do 90% of your driving on electricity and still use it as a normal gasmobile if you need to go farther than 40 miles."

electricvehicles,2ua3b0,paulwesterberg,2,Sat Jan 31 20:00:48 2015 UTC,"This is a really good topic for a thread.   Unfortunately I don't have any first hand experience with electric cars, but here's what I can tell you:  Electric cars are generally simpler, so there's less prone to go wrong than with a gasoline car. That being said, I don't know much about the cost of repairs, so I'm not sure how to really evaluate the true cost of maintenance (I'm pretty sure it varies vehicle to vehicle anyways. I do know that the Tesla Model S does cost an unusually high amount to repair when it gets in accidents due to the all aluminum body.  For the life expectancy of the car, the biggest concern is usually the life span of the battery. I think the early leaf vehicles in particular had issues with owners experiencing large amounts of range loss, (particularly in warmer climates). Not every vehicle has problems with this. Here's a graph of range degradation experienced by actual owners of the Model S over the course of <80,000 kilometers.  As you can see, it's not very much. Several drivers have >94% capacity after 50k kilometers. And it looks like the range degradation slowed after that   If you can wait > 2 years for an electric car, I would recommend you do so. Tesla, Nissan, and Chevy are all coming out with cars that will cost around $35,000 and have ~200 miles of range in 2017. That is a big jump from electric cars today, which either have very limited range (Leaf, i3) or are very expensive (Model S)."
electricvehicles,2ua3b0,joshuahedlund,1 point,Thu Feb 5 00:09:48 2015 UTC,"I see! I'm really happy to hear about the lowered cost for maintenance. It's my dream in life to one day owe a Tesla, and it'll happen one day. Not soon, but somewhere down the line!   I'm all for getting a new car like this, but those maintenance costs are going to be what'll kill me. If I go to a mechanic and try to get it fixed, it'll be like , ""Well. . . there went my savings.""   I will probably wait that long for the newest gen to come out. I plan on going overseas and saving money, and when I come back, I'll have enough to make a down payment on a car. In the meantime, I'll quietly stash money away and hope that something will catch my eye in the near future.   I'll just hope that more stores put EV charging stations in their parking lots, though. I hope that becomes the new thing. . . Free charging. Everywhere."

Check out line 61 on your 1040 to see what your total tax was last year.  If you don't think you'll get the full value of the tax credit, consider leasing or buying used.

Putting level 2 chargers at a grocery store doesn't do any good. It's just too slow. Up in Seattle, they had quick chargers at the grocery stores so you could do 30 minutes of shopping and put around 60-80 miles in the tank. A level 2 in the same time will give you like 7 miles. Level 2 chargers are placed in all the wrong places. If you're charging at work, a normal 110v wall plug will give you 4 miles per hour (32 miles for a 9-5 work day). No expensive chargers should be necessary for daily commute charging.   Personally, I'd rather forego the fancy J1772 plug and stick a plain old male NEMA 5-15 plug under the charger door so we can hook up a standard extension cord.    Spend more money putting in quick chargers along our highway system. Sure, the 28 QC chargers around the DFW area are useful for busy driving days, but I would really love to see maybe 4 QC chargers installed between Dallas and Austin.

electricvehicles,2tbmrr,tech01x,2,Fri Jan 23 00:44:41 2015 UTC,"All of these < 100kW DC chargers are a waste of money. It's BMW & VW's money to waste at least. These chargers are too slow to reasonably support long distance travel and they are extraordinarily expensive. The 24 kW versions are not much better than 80A J1772, which is a real shame. Too bad they aren't helping build out a long term L2 charging network.  It also puts their long range BEV plans into focus. There is no reason for BMW and VW to put money into building a network of slow DC chargers (24 kW to 50 kW) if they are coming out with BEVs with 200 mile range soon. Real 200 mile BEVs need 100 kW fast charging spread about 120-140 miles apart. Therefore they don't believe they are coming out with 200 mile range BEVs anytime soon.  We will need lots of 40A to 80A J1772 destination charging, even in a world of 200+ mile range BEVs. It's really a shame that the various automakers that don't make long range BEVs (Nissan, BMW, VW, GM) aren't helping building out a long lasting L2 destination charging network with sufficiently high enough amperage. A 60 kWh battery will need 6 hours to charge empty to full at 40A. At 24A, it's 10.5 hours. 8 hours to charge a 85kWh battery at 40A, almost 14 hours at 24A. So when all these various automakers make 200+ mile BEVs, they will have to have at least 40A J1772 charging (10kW). They could put 10-20 kW J1772's into their existing cars and help build out this infrastructure and completely forgo the idiotic DC charging (CHAdeMO, CCS, whatever) they are putting in today. With a 80A J1772 at 19kW, the difference in charging a Leaf or an i3 is really not that far from a 24 kW DCFC. However, the cost to put in a 80A J1772 EVSE is likely $2000-4000, while the cost of putting in a 24 kW DC EVSE is about $8000-10000. In a world where we need many plugs, it makes more sense to have lots of 80A J1772 rather than far fewer 24 kW DCFC for the same price."
electricvehicles,2tbmrr,shnikees,1 point,Fri Jan 23 16:24:13 2015 UTC,"But the problem with level 2 charging at 80A is that the vehicle needs to have an 80A charger.  Outside of Tesla, the biggest charger is 40A on the RAV4 EV.  Upgrading to 80A would mean adding a few thousand dollars worth of charger to each new vehicle, and even that upgrade only gets you to 19kW  The benefit of DC is that the conversion happens at the ""pump"" not the vehicle.  A DC charged car can pretty much accept whatever amperage the charger can spit out (within reason).  To get faster charging, you upgrade the DC charger, not the vehicle.  This means you only have to upgrade a few hundred chargers rather than a few hundred thousand vehicles.  And yes, 24Kw is rather paltry, but it is way better than the current 7.7kW chargers and also better than an 80A charger at 19kw.  Plus, those 24kW chargers can be upgraded to 100kW down the road without having to modify the vehicles."
electricvehicles,2tbmrr,ViperRT10Matt,1 point,Fri Jan 23 16:50:46 2015 UTC,"J1772's can scale down from 80A, so if your car can only take 32A, you can still use it.  No one is upgrading a car that takes 50 kW now to 100 kW. The internal cabling won't support it and likely the car is already sized for the maximum C-rate. Further, the need for 80A J1772 is going to be there for many years.. for the foreseeable future since that is about the limits of what you can put in your house and charge a long range BEV within an overnight (8 hour) period. So all the future long range BEV's in the 2018/2025 time period will need to 40A-80A destination charging.  There are two kinds of charging networks needed for large scale BEV deployment. The emphasis on the destination charging, as in less than 50 kW is going to require many plugs. These plugs will have to be as inexpensive as possible. So putting the expense into the EV charging point is not going to work. Each and every hotel is going to need 2-15 plugs. The cost of putting in 8 x 80A J1772 is something like $20,000. That won't even pay for a single combo 50kW CHAdeMO/CCS EVSE. It is hard enough to get destination charging at hotels, parks, and other long term stay places without making each plug cost $30,000-80,000.  Upgrading EVSE's makes no sense... the cost is prohibitive except in the highest traffic areas. Putting more in makes sense, but having to go back and upgrade slow CHAdeMO/CCS units is just stupid."

electricvehicles,2tf8rp,afishinacloud,2,Fri Jan 23 20:26:12 2015 UTC,"SAE chargers are built to specifications that were agreed upon by several automotive manufacturers ( it was also required by the old CARB regulations so it got early investment) so any car built to these specifications can charge at any charger regardless of brand or power provider. Its the same as standard fuel fillers now where any ICE car can fill up at any petrol pump and it will work regardless of brand.   To build a car to use Tesla superchargers you have to use Tesla proprietary tech, all chargers that car will ever use will in some way be controlled by Tesla and likely branded by them in some way. Firstly branding wise this does not look good as Tesla are less than subtle (http://ecomento.com/2015/01/09/underground-tesla-supercharger-station-in-london-is-stunning/) imagine a new BMW owner having to use those, that does not look good for the brand at all.   Secondly Tesla could decide to change the design of superchargers in some way or just charge huge amounts to access the tech suddenly and any car manufacturer using that standard will be screwed. Imagine how bad BMW or VW would look if owners of 3-4 year old cars suddenly cannot change them because there is no charger network available to them, NOT good.   The Tesla supercharger is very very good but its possible to build an entirely independent version and have none of the downsides. These new fast charge stations are built to a standard that all US/EU car manufacturers use so its got a huge amount of money behind it for future expansion. Tesla could likely easily make chargers SAE standard but i think they want to become a supplier of charging/battery tech and so would rather use their own tech and push that instead."

Right now it's a pissing match between manufacturers, like VHS vs Betamax, with consumers stuck in the middle until the market picks a winner.

electricvehicles,2tc2bk,hipst,1 point,Sat Jan 24 00:53:41 2015 UTC,Wrong.  CCS has a different AC connector component (Mennekes) Type II in Europe than North America (J1772) Type I and as such does not enjoy true international coverage.  CHAdeMO is the same connector globally.
electricvehicles,2tc2bk,FelixVanOost,2,Sat Jan 24 02:23:23 2015 UTC,"That's not what I claimed. The reason the connectors are different is because CCS works in both AC and DC modes. Because the US and Europe have different AC voltages and phases, the connectors had to be tailored for each market. The reason CHAdeMO is the same worldwide is because it is DC only, which means that cars also need to have a separate Type-2 or J1772 connector for AC charging."

electricvehicles,2tc2bk,robertbowerman,1 point,Sat Jan 24 02:26:32 2015 UTC,"CCS is the standard of the EU and the major US car manufacturers.  Therefore over time it will win out.  Basically the Germans and the USA got together and stiched up the Japanese and to a small degree the French (with the Zoe).  However CCS still includes Mennekes for slow charging at home which is good.  Really there is not a significant different between CCS and CHAdeMO technically, both are DC high voltage fast chargers.  CHAdeMO has a nasty 80% ceiling for charges.  CCS in theory has the ability to be stretched to faster charging for batteries 2x or 3x what we have now, which is really where it will help.  Over the next 3 years you can expect a lot more CCS points.  In my view there is no way that Japan can achieve a reversal in the standards realm.  Nissan will have to adopt CCS over time.  In the mean time rapid charging stations (at least the ones I know in the UK) are supporting all 3 standards.  I think for rapid charging DC is a better idea than AC as the overall cost is lower (the EU rule of thumb is 1 public charger per 10 electric cars) and the weight of the cars should be lower without the charger in it.   In the UK there are just about enough of all 3 standards in somewhat even distribution to not make a particular difference on what car to buy.  Nissan is market leader.  Zoe is the price leader with comparable features to Nissan.  BMW i3 is the features leader with double the price.  If you've got the money you'll love an i3.  If you've got even more money you might afford a Tesla and then you'll be happier still.  If money is tight then, like me, the Zoe is the car for you.  Its air quality features (ioniser, air pollution sensor and shut off outside air when its unclean, essential oils are profound for well being and alertness, as are all 3 air quality features).  Nissan users appear to get a hair more range than  the Zoe users, but it mostly seems to be that they are more content to pootle about at 45mph.  So I'd focus on best car you can afford rather than on plug."
electricvehicles,2tc2bk,Anderlan,3,Fri Jan 23 05:32:46 2015 UTC,"""CHAdeMO has a nasty 80% ceiling for charges."" No.  All EV charge controllers, and your phone, like to throttle power at the top of the charge cycle, like you reduce the tap when filling a glass of water to the brim.  It's a well known property of the broad family of lithium battery chemistry.  Manufacturers also can just lock out the top of the battery, and thus lop of the end of the power/charge curve. Volt does this, but Volt only takes 3.3kW.  If Volt took a DCFC charge, it would probably take 20-30kW across the whole duration of the charging process.  ""CCS in theory has the ability to be stretched to faster charging for batteries 2x or 3x what we have now, which is really where it will help. "" ??  As others state, both standards can be upped to 100kW.  You seem to talk about 150kW.  Sure, why not????  Do you have some sources we can explore?"
electricvehicles,2tc2bk,hipst,2,Fri Jan 23 19:26:14 2015 UTC,The DC chargers ASK what the car wants and then gives it to them.  If the charge goes to 80% it's because that is what the car wants.
electricvehicles,2tc2bk,tech01x,-2,Sat Jan 24 02:25:12 2015 UTC,"The answer is that both suck right now, because neither provide charging rates above 100 kW right now.  Both shouldn't' be deployed at all right now."
electricvehicles,2tc2bk,tech01x,3,Fri Jan 23 16:31:40 2015 UTC,I have DC charged my leaf many times and it has allowed me to do awesome road trips. I agree that it should be improved. 100 kW would be great but I don't think the batteries would be able to take that charge for long. So it is really something we will want when (non tesla) ev's start coming with bigger batteries.
electricvehicles,2tc2bk,ElectricNed,1 point,Fri Jan 23 18:59:42 2015 UTC,"Your Leaf is a first generation product that is due to be replaced in 2017 or 2018 with a product that has double the range. The cadence for your Leaf is 1 hour of driving at highway speeds, 45 minutes to charge with a 50kW CHAdeMO EVSE. That isn't a cadence that most people with put up with and so to spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, especially taxpayer dollars to enable a slightly longer operating range is ridiculous.  Many people need to charge now just for running around town in a first generation BEV that isn't a Tesla. With the coming 2nd generation BEVs with double the range, that won't be the case. With 150 miles of range on tap, there would be almost zero reason to charge at a grocery store, Walgreens, or pretty much anywhere that your car will be at within a city for the vast majority of commuters in all weather. The charging infrastructure will need to cater to out of town guests and the occasional top off, which means shopping malls, hotel/motels, theme parks, and work places.   With the future needs of a destination charging network in mind, for the cost of putting a single 50kW CHAdeMO/CCS combo unit, a hotel can put in 20 x 80A J1772 or 40 x 40A J1772. For 10 BEV's staying overnight, would you rather move your car to the EVSE at 2:00am and come back at 2:45am, or just have the the 10 plug into a J1772's overnight? Of course destination charging will be on L2 charging and long range BEV's will need 40A to 80A charging. With up to 150 kWh batteries for long range BEVs, we'll need to up 80A charging to keep charging times under 8 hours.  On the other hand, to support long distance trips, a 48 kWh battery that can charge at up to 2C will want 100 kW DC charging. That's a cadence of 1.75 hours of driving, 45 minutes of charging. Not great, but much better than the first generation Leaf. Almost tolerable. Or a 60kWh battery that charges at 1.7C (Tesla Model S 60), which is a cadence of 2.25 hours of driving, 35 minute charging. A 50 kW charge point is really not worth the price. Basically, anything less than 100 kW will be seen as pretty much useless except in emergencies. But the price for such emergency chargers is way too high."
electricvehicles,2tc2bk,tech01x,1 point,Wed Jan 28 18:01:40 2015 UTC,"I get what your saying but my understanding is that CHAdeMO is upgradable when these new cars come out.  It's not like they have to scrap the existing infrastructure. They just need to update it. I also obviously agree that destination charging should be Level 2.   Also it has never ever taken 45 minutes to fast charge my leaf. Maybe in a really hot climate?? It certainly does take more time to do road trips in my car but the ones I take are mostly under 200 miles and only add on an hour or so. For some that's still a deal breaker. That's why we need EV's with bigger batteries! For me, it has been fine."

All < 90kW chargers are a complete waste of money.... to the tune of millions of dollars of public money.  Totally the wrong move.  Deploy 80A J1772 instead, that infrastructure needs to be built out and will last a far longer time (like through 2030 ish). The only reason to deploy CHAdeMO or CCS right now is for competitive blocking reasons.. not what is actually good for our EV infrastructure."

My daily commute does not require the REX but since this is our only car now, I needed it in case of the unexpected. I couldn't recommend this car more. It's more spacious than my old Mazda 3.

It has a ton of features, most of which I haven't explored yet. My favorite being adaptive cruise control. All I need to do is keep it in the lane during traffic and the car drives itself. Is it the best car for a road trip? probably not. It's also not appropriate for a family of 5. But let's not dismiss what BMW has done with this vehicle. They have a great looking (in my opinion), profit generating, marketable EV, without the range anxiety, while still allowing the vast majority of driving to be electric. on top of all of that, they made it awesome to drive.

The target markets for BEVs (and that would be the markets for a BEV truck) are NOT that market.   Those S10 conversions are almost always already at gross payload.   Just like the Ford Ranger EV, the Chevy S-10 EV was not a conversion. It was a manufactured vehicle sold as-new by Chevrolet.  The S-10 with lead acid batteries has a 951lb payload.  Not quite a half-ton like the ICE S-10, but close.  I can't find the numbers, but I'd suspect the NiMH batteries (again as a factory option) would've given you the full half ton, in addition to more range and battery acceleration"
electricvehicles,2t5lax,smithandjohnson,0,Thu Jan 22 03:14:15 2015 UTC,"I grew up in a large ag-town where every other car on the road was a full sized pickup. Most of them were used for commuting to high school, or commutting to work.   That's what most pickup trucks are used for, but people buy them instead of cars for the reasons I named, they want the freedom that a pickup truck provides.   You just listed a whole bunch of things that people you know do that are not suitable for ANY BEV.    Duh.   The fact that we're talking about trucks is entirely irrelevant.   We're talking about what people use trucks for.   It sounds like you live somewhere quite rural, with wilderness-loving friends and family.   No, I live in a city, but people have to drive long distances to get to places where they use their pickups in the ways that a pickup truck is meant to be used.    The target markets for BEVs (and that would be the markets for a BEV truck) are NOT that market.   That's my point, the people who buy trucks are not the same group of people who would buy BEVs.  The BEV pickups you listed have a pathetic range when empty, I can't imagine what they'd be if they had a large payload.  A BEV Subaru wagon kind of thing would be cool, but a pickup just doesn't make any sense."
electricvehicles,2t5lax,diesel_stinks_,1 point,Thu Jan 22 16:34:26 2015 UTC,"Pickups are often used to haul heavy loads on the highway, a good number of people would be very concerned about range.   Ok, so let's look at that, shall we?    The absolute smallest engine you can get in a modern Ford F150, is a 2.7L V6 EcoBoost engine, which weighs in at about 440lbs.  Then you can add in the 240 lbs for the transmission, and you're talking about somewhere in the vicinity of 700 lbs just by removing those parts.  And that's dry weight, for the lightest version, but let's roll with it.  Now, let's look at the Tesla battery pack, shall we?  They're apparently using 6,831 of Panasonic's NCR18650 batteries, each weighing in at about 45g (PDF).  That means Tesla's 85kWh pack is coming in at 307.395kg, or 677.69 lbs.  In other words, we can basically do a direct swap between the Tesla 85kWh battery pack and the 2.7L EcoBoost drive train.  Factor in the 23 gallons of fuel, the connector the guy on the transmission page was talking about, and that still leaves somewhere around 200-250 lbs for the Motor before you start cutting in to payload capacity.  Now, given the basic rule of thumb of 0.1 Wh per mile per pound, that means that the heaviest Curb Weight of the 2.7L EcoBoost F150 is 4,806 lbs, we're talking about 0.45 kWh per mile, which translates to around 175 miles per charge.    [EDIT: Based on /u/ViperRT10Matt's observation that the battery pack is 1300#, those numbers get tweaked a bit.  You'd lose about 600# of payload capacity and only be able to drive 160 miles per charge.]    Its more about GOBS of torque available at any speed.     Again, heavy loads, lots of power, lots of energy consumed.    Ok, yeah, a lot of energy.  Sticking with the 85 kWh pack, and assuming a load that would barely refrain from voiding your warranty, the GVWR of 7,050 pounds, that should take a whopping 705wH per mile driven.  That's more than twice the Tesla's energy cost for the same distance.   ...but with a 85 kWh pack, you should get somewhere around 120 miles of range, even with your truck maxed out.  [EDIT: No change here, except that 600# of what used to be calculated as Payload is now part of your Curb Weight.  Allowing about 1600# of payload.]   Over much shorter distances.   ...and how many people go more than 120 miles with their truck loaded down to the point the shocks are dying?  Some?  Sure.  For them, a small generator under the bonnet will do beautifully.    For everybody else, you can move your friend across town in a single charge.   Not without cutting into its payload   Sure, but let's look at what it'd take to get the Tesla Model S 85's range of 265 miles.  0.4806 kWh per mile, times 265 miles comes out to about 127.359 kWh of battery.  That's almost exactly half again the Telsa battery pack.  So, you're looking at an additional 337 pounds or so.  Meaning you're trading a payload equal to two of your construction buddies to get you about another out to 248 miles.  That's about the same payload hit as if you chose the Super Crew cab over the Regular cab.  [EDIT: Using the same calculations, this brings us to 6,056# curb weight for a 127.5 kWh pack,  for 210 miles empty, or the same 180 miles with a little less than 1,000# of payload.]    TL;DR: Replacing the Drive Train and Fuel System of the smallest engine Ford F150 with a the Drive Train and Battery from a Model S 85 (or better, and 85D), and you'll have almost the same horsepower of the largest engine (with torque the entire way) and between 120 and 175 160 miles of range per charge, depending on payload.  Add half again the battery pack, and you extend your range to about 180 miles (max load) to 250 210 miles (just you)."
electricvehicles,2t5lax,MuaddibMcFly,2,Thu Jan 22 23:53:11 2015 UTC,"Your math on the tesla pack weight is quite off. It's not just the sum of the cells; it's heat sinks, cooling system plumbing, internal bracing, exterior casing, and heavy duty bottom plate armor. The figure I hear batted around is 1300 lbs."

electricvehicles,2srnz4,texasroadkill,4,Sun Jan 18 02:43:28 2015 UTC,I'm guessing you would also refuse to buy any General Electric or Rolls Royce product as they still make products that kill people? Or is it okay because it doesn't kill Westerners?

electricvehicles,2srnz4,EquinsuOcha,10,Sat Jan 17 22:47:17 2015 UTC,Nissan also produced military equipment used during World War II. Most of the Japanese suppliers that provide parts to Tesla likely produced military equipment or supplies used during World War II.  World War II ended almost 70 years ago. There are almost certainly no people involved in either company today that were involved during the war. How long does it make sense to carry a grudge?

electricvehicles,2s5yet,MrTizl,1 point,Tue Jan 13 15:10:18 2015 UTC,"For one, the battery pallet is large, so that's the starting point to determine the size of the car. It starts just behind the front tires and stops just in front of the back tires and goes all the way across from door to door.   Second, people want a car that looks like a normal car. The Leaf is not a looker. No matter what you say. It's an odd duck with a worse friction coefficient than the Model S.   As for trunks, the Model S is a road trip capable car. The Leaf is a city car. If you load the family in an S and head across country, you'll probably use every bit of the trunk and the frunk. The Leaf doesn't need as much storage because you can't go very far.   The Model S was the highest rated car ever by Consumer Reports with a 99/100. The Leaf was recently removed from the CR recommendation list for poor crash test results.

The RAV4 EV can do 200 miles, could be purchased for less than $30,000 (after incentives and tax credits) back in 2013, but since it's EPA-rated at 103, nobody in their right mind would call it a 200 mile EV. Remember when Volkswagen were all excited about the ""115 mile"" range of the e-Golf only to run away with their tail between their legs when it was actually rated at 83? That's what's going to happen here, only worse.  But it doesn't matter anyway. Quotes like this from the press release...  [The Bolt will] incorporate the concept automatic park-and-retrieval technology, which enables the driver to exit the vehicle and tell the Bolt EV concept to park itself – and when errands are completed, the Bolt EV concept can be summoned to return to the owner’s location.  ... makes it clear that GM's in some sort of marketing fantasyland with this one."

electricvehicles,2roff2,Anderlan,2,Sat Jan 10 05:36:29 2015 UTC,"Also, 30A chargers shouldn't be $600.  Just saying.  The American EVSE is a sham.  It's some safeguards that are redundant because your car's charger (the actual charger, the inverter and charge controller) and your house's wiring (the fuse which should pop well before your house's wiring gets hot, if your wiring is worth anything) already have safeguards.  So, anyway, they should go down in price, they are going down in price.  They only ever had any value above $300 because the market was so small and undeveloped."

electricvehicles,2rhtja,One_Wheel_Drive,1 point,Tue Jan 6 07:43:21 2015 UTC,"This report keeps coming up and is always misreported. The main concern of the report is not GHG (but they do get more than just a mention) but pollution dollar cost where pollution is defined as damage from ozone (O3) and particulate matter.  Figure 3 of this report compares the damage produced by vehicles powered by various means e.g. gasoline, diesel, EV etc.  That bar graph makes the EV look very bad.  It looks bad because they are comparing damage for the energy equivalent of 1 gallon of gasoline (3.7kWh). But of course gasoline powered vehicles are very inefficient while EVs are the opposite. What they should depict is damage per mile, in which case for the worst case (pure coal fired grid) the EV is no worse than the ICE vehicles. Nowhere within the continental USA is the grid purely coal fired so EVs will always be cleaner."
electricvehicles,2rguj1,Destione,4,Tue Jan 6 02:01:35 2015 UTC,"This is just a cynical exercise. The article is the best I've seen on this because it does point out that apart from production and distribution patents (i.e. anything to do with the fuel cell or the vehicle) they are only royalty free for 5 years after which you should be prepared to start paying Toyota. Something I leaned from the article is that Toyota requires you to enter into a contractual agreement first before you can use the patents. Where the article fails is it gives Toyota a free ride when they claim this will reduce GHG emissions. 95% of all H2 produced within the USA comes from methane (which comes from fracking sites, sites that often leak CH4 directly into the atmosphere, and methane is a potent GHG). The conversion of methane into H2 releases either or both CO2 and CO because for every CH4 molecule you reform with steam to get hydrogen you get one molecue of CO or CO2.  There is a reason big oil is behind the push for hydrogen fuel cells. The other 5% of hydrogen comes mostly from the electrolysis of water but because this is so energy intensive (i.e. expensive) it is only done when there is a need to green wash the production of hydrogen."

With gas at $2/gallon it's a much tougher sell.  Unfortunately, I think you'll find that across the industry dealerships and salespeople are not well educated about EVs and plug-ins.

These are to be shared charging stations, almost definitely level 2, not dedicated spots. They will charge the EV owner extra for leaving their car after charging stops, and the owner will have to move their car.  Let's say the owner has a 75-80 mile commute - not absurd, considering that Google's office is up to 40 miles from San Francisco one way. That's likely to be 20-25kWh of electricity, and 3-7 hours of charging.  The EV owner gets back to the apartment building, and people are charging in all of the available spots. In a best-case scenario, the worker will have to pull into a non-EV space, but more likely, they'll have to street park (despite what the article states, there is not some glut of unassigned parking spaces in San Francisco) and then suddenly drop whatever they're doing to run back out to where they're street parked and manage to pull into the space before someone - who might not even live in the apartment building - takes the space.  Finally, success. It's 10:00pm, and they're finally charging. But that means that they have to get back up between 1:00am-5:00am and go and find street parking again. Good luck with that.  Or what happens when the spots are oversubscribed and the apartment dweller just can't find a charger because people keep pulling in? Do they... miss work, because they can't find a charge? There's way too much risk with this model.  I'm all in favor of any firm installing charging stations, but shared charging stations are truly a pain and will not work until either all parking spaces have EVSEs available or charging takes an insignificant amount of time. As most apartment dwellers prefer assigned parking spaces anyway, even without charging, due to the risk of having to find street parking if all the spaces are full, adding EV charging to the mix sounds truly miserable."

That's highway driving, so I used the EPA number that actually matches his use case.  And how much better, 10mpg? As anyone will tell you, miles per gallon is a horrible way to measure consumption as the scale compresses heavily as you go up.  A 10mpg increase from 10 to 20mpg is a big deal; a 10mpg increase from 40 to 50mpg will amount to a minor fuel savings.  And for all this he's giving up the ability to do a good chunk of his miles in EV mode.  Even if he drives a full half of his miles on gas, say 7k/year, the savings he'd get from going 40 to 50mpg would be a whopping $100 or so per year.  He probably pays more than that in tolls.

electricvehicles,2r6x0l,mburke6,2,Sun Jan 4 16:10:09 2015 UTC,"I looked into converting a car a few years ago.  This was just before large format lithium cells came on the market, around 2005-2006.  I was originally going to use lead acid batteries for a car capable of 30-35 mile range and a battery pack that would need to be replaced every 3 or 4 years.  Lithium batteries became available around 2008 and changed the whole concept of our car from a fun hobby project to a car that was perfectly practical for everyday use.  The donor cars we were looking at were a 70s VW Beetle, 1st gen Mazda RX7, Mazda Miata, and a few other larger cars where it would be easier to mount all the batteries.  We were looking for light weight cars that would be cheap to purchase.  In general, I thought a convertible would be best since the car would likely not have AC.  The car needed to have a manual transmission because DC motors run at under 5000 RPM and you need a transmission to obtain highway speeds.  To calculate the car's range, I estimated the EV's mileage at around 250 watt hours per mile based on other conversion cars other people had done.  For a 50 mile range car we would have needed a 15kwh battery pack.(15,000kwh / 250wh per mile = 60 mile)  This would have left us with a total range of 60 miles, but since you don't want to drain your lithium battery pack down all the way, 50 miles usable.  The lithium cells we were looking at were Thundersky 100 ah cells.(now Winston)  We wanted a peppy car, so we figured on a battery voltage of 150 volts.  These cells are 3.2 volts, so 47 cells would be needed, wired in series.  100 amp/hour cells multiplied by a battery voltage of 150 volts results in a battery pack energy capacity of 15kwh.  The cost of those 100ah cells is $135.00 per cell multiplied by 50 cells (3 spares) results in a battery pack cost of $6,750, not including shipping.  To get your desired 100 mile range, you would need two of these battery packs, either wired in series or in parallel, depending on your motor and controller's voltage limits.  These cells are pretty large, so fitting 100 of them in a car would be a challenge."

electricvehicles,2r33y6,hwillis,1 point,Fri Jan 2 20:56:08 2015 UTC,"Gladly! Before watching Ben's DVD, my idea of an EV conversion revolved around 3-wheeler 'Bajajs' (as-in Indian movies) that are very common in this part of the world. But after, I got convinced that a regular 4-wheeler was quite as feasible. So, I started off with an old Toyota Starlet (4 cylinder , rear-wheel driven car) here, weighs about 600kg with its old engine, but has a good, sturdy body. Acquiring a >10KW DC motor in Ethiopia has not been easy, so I went with the AC motor&controller option. I preferred this ecause the city I live in is full of hills (like rolling country), so I think I can get considerable mileage with the regenerative breaking the AC setup brings. I am still considering various controller vendors (I liked the OpenRevolt controller most, however, I won't be building my own controller any time soon). Following people's advice, I wont remove the existing gearbox, as it may come in handy for steep slopes and what not. Right now, I am at the steps of setting up the motor-gearbox coupler. Next I will buy a controller. A buddy of mine also wants his car (Toyota Hilux Pickup) converted, yay! Where I work, team in my department is trying to research and show the role and viability of electricity in the transportation sector. More importantly, in land-locked, non-oil producing countries like ours, this is very important! Another cool fact, more than 99% of electricity generation in Ethiopia is hydro-electric...so EVs become more or less clean, busting another criticism that some ppl make. the Revo is coming!"

You can have an electrician install a meter just on the leg from the breaker box that goes to your charger if you have an isolated circuit, but that's going to be pricey. Here's something you can get installed that will show you graphs of your power usage, but it's hard wired in so you can't move it around. $160 for the meter plus maybe the same for installation, so $300-400 to be able to make a graph. http://www.ekmmetering.com/ekm-omnimeter-i-v-3-universal-smart-meter-single-phase-or-3-phase-120-to-480v-50-60hz-up-to-5000-amps.html?gclid=CMSvir3L9cICFSwLMgodVmAAeg"

I think the appropriate response here would be to leave a kindly worded but clear note about the inconvenience caused to EV drivers when those spots are taken, just like if handicap access spots were taken by cars without placards.  The best practice for siting EV charging spots is definitely not at the front of the building, that just creates class-based resentment that nobody needs.

But my logical side says the spots designated were already full, and the parkers did not have the requirements to park in that spot. For example, at an office building with reserved spots, handicapped people can't park in the CEO's spot even if their spot is full. The lot should have had more spaces if they were going to all be filled.  But I think the point stands; they weren't allowed to park there, and inconvenienced someone who has made their own sacrifices to gain the ability to park in those spots.  Would I have towed them? I don't know. I don't think you made a mistake by not towing them, and I think you're a good person morally.

The car is unable to consume any power in any other time since the contactors/relays to send AC current to the car will not be engaged outside those times....

The system recaptures as electric energy what cannot be turned back into fossil fuel. If the principle is similar, the batteries only the plane recharge only when it's breaking?"

If we take this article's assumption of 15,000 miles/year, 3 miles/kWh, and $0.12/kWh, that means the average EV driver pays about $72 more in annual electric utility taxes than drivers of gassers.  Where's the outcry over this? All those utility taxes are funding important state and local services - services that gassers use too. All non-EV driving ""freeloaders"" should pay a $70/year tax to make up for this. They'll still come out $2 ""ahead"" of us EV drivers."
electricvehicles,2q761m,fooljoe,2,Tue Dec 23 20:18:22 2014 UTC,The problem is utility taxes don't often translate to car related infrastructure. Whereas the gas tax does.
electricvehicles,2q761m,djm19,2,Wed Dec 24 22:57:25 2014 UTC,"You might think that, but you'd be wrong. The idea of dedicated tax revenues is a sham. The fact that gas tax receipts are sent to the highway trust fund has no bearing on how much money is spent on roads or other ""car-related infrastructure."" That decision is in the hands of elected representatives, and money from other sources always has and always will be needed beyond what gas taxes provide. Therefore any sort of tax can be and is used for roads.  Money is fungible. The government collects money and the government spends money, and any apparent link between the source of the funds and the expenditure is generally just a trick employed by politicians to pass new taxes."
electricvehicles,2q761m,fooljoe,1 point,Wed Dec 24 23:50:42 2014 UTC,"No argument here. I've spent many a long post on reddit explaining to people that the highway trust fund doesn't cover even half of related transportation spending.   But it is a general loss of revenue for the government to no longer be getting fuel taxes for cars that are still using the road. In 2004, fuel sales resulted in 40 billion in federal taxes that theoretically make it easier to spend 40 billion on transportation (even if its not a 1:1 ratio...even if its half that). Thats declined with better fuel economy and market forces, but would only be exacerbated by a future shift to an electric car economy of a notable size.   I prefer some combination of a fuel tax AND a mileage tax. (fuel consumers would pay both)"
electricvehicles,2q761m,djm19,1 point,Thu Dec 25 00:48:44 2014 UTC,"But it is a general loss of revenue for the government to no longer be getting fuel taxes for cars that are still using the road   Of course it is, but that's by design. The effect of any excise tax is to reduce demand of the item being taxed, and so the receipts from that tax will naturally decrease over time. The idea that we should tie this decreasing revenue stream to an expense that will only grow over time is, of course, foolhardy. So, like I pointed out before, we don't actually tie them together! The association is purely a political trick.  And by the way, the trend in falling gas tax receipts long predates the availability of electric cars. And electric cars are still such a tiny slice of the market their impact is negligible when compared against that of the steady rise in ICE vehicle efficiency. So if lawmakers really wanted to address this ""problem"" they'd tax any vehicle that gets better than some fixed MPG. But of course everyone immediately recognizes how ridiculous that is, while being blind to the ridiculousness of taxing EVs, even though it's precisely the same idea.  It's best to just completely detach the two ideas in your mind. On the one hand, the government needs to collect a certain amount of tax revenue to cover ALL its obligations. On the other hand, one of those obligations is maintaining the highway infrastructure.  When you look at it that way, you see that if government has a funding shortfall, then all options are on the table. And when deciding upon ways to increase tax revenue, it doesn't matter at all where the dollars from one source will be spent, all that matters is the bottom line. So if roads need more funding, there's no reason at all to look to a road-related source of income. We could take from something else with too much funding (all those extra electric utility taxes from EVs might be something worth exploring), increase an existing tax, or create a new tax.  But if choosing to raise an existing tax or create a new one, the primary consideration needs to be upon what economic effects this new taxation will have. Does it make more sense to tax a new market that is otherwise being incentivized through tax policy (i.e. EVs), or to do something more benign like raise income or property taxes? The answer should be obvious, but unfortunately what politicians actually consider is not the effect of a new tax, but is instead how they can dupe the public into getting the new tax passed."
electricvehicles,2q761m,fooljoe,1 point,Mon Dec 29 18:37:10 2014 UTC,The gas tax original intent was not to reduce fuel consumption. That's a relatively recent notion (and still not agreed upon by all).  You are thinking of a sin tax. A use tax is merely to make those using an infrastructure be the primary payers of said infrastructure.
electricvehicles,2q761m,djm19,1 point,Mon Dec 29 19:14:54 2014 UTC,"What the ""intent"" of any tax is could never be agreed upon, and is irrelevant anyway. All that matters is what its effect is. And the gas tax is very much analogous to a ""sin tax"" (as it should be) in that its effect is to reduce consumption. And that's good!  What you'd call a ""use tax"" is just a toll. If we want to convert our roads to a pay-as-you-go system I guess that could be done reasonably, but given that they were mostly built using public funds and given that a strong transportation infrastructure is vital to the success of all, including non-drivers, there would be a strong argument against doing that.  But even if it were decided to implement a national toll road system, the EV taxes put forth so far are nowhere near a fair toll system. A fair system would be based upon miles driven and weight for all cars and trucks, regardless of what the state of the completely separate gas and electric utility taxes are. And I think the effect of that would be trucks paying much more than they do now, with small cars and particularly EVs (which are typically lighter and driven less than average cars) paying a relatively inconsequential amount."

electricvehicles,2pptwr,kieranmullen,2,Fri Dec 19 16:43:22 2014 UTC,"It seems to me that there's no reason at all to want brake pads to be used instead of regenerative braking. You'd always want regenerative braking to be used first and only start using the actual brakes if the car is still not slowing down enough. The driver makes that decision by pressing harder on the brake pedal if they're not stopping fast enough.  From the video I really can't figure out the purpose of the switch. They mention the Cadillac ELR where I found this information:   The ELR has what Cadillac calls “Regen on Demand,”  which sort of mimics the way the Tesla Model S initiates regenerative braking every time its driver lifts off the throttle. Squeezing and holding either of the steering-wheel paddles triggers this function. It is either on or off, not progressive like a brake pedal, so there is a bit of a learning curve. Regen on Demand decelerates the car at a maximum of 0.20 g, with the brake lights illuminating at 0.12 g and above. At 0.20 g, an ELR would theoretically stop from 70 mph in about 800 feet, versus 173 feet (0.95 g) in a full-brake situation. But the ELR won’t come to a complete stop using only Regen on Demand.   The Leaf has a separate ""B"" driving mode that causes more regeneration while coasting but the brake pedal is not part of that equation either. You take your foot off of the accelerator and the car simply slows down faster than usual while coasting. It's kind of like downshifting in a manual. It sounds to me like the Chevy Volt feature is just like this but perhaps with a range of control."
electricvehicles,2pptwr,AbandonedTrilby,1 point,Fri Dec 19 18:38:05 2014 UTC,"The amount of regen is limited in leafs based on the ambient temperature.  So if you demand more deceleration (by pushing on the brake harder)than the regen system will allow, it will use the brakes."

For the Prius, especially early on, there were rumors that it was ""battery"" mode, and people would use it all the time.  What it actually does is keep the engine on all the time. In this mode, when the gas engine is not needed for power, it's engaged in gear with delayed engine timing and no gas, no spark firing. This is all just so that it pumps air through the engine and creates a lot of resistance, slowing down the car.    Why would you want to do that, like, ever?  Turns out it's ""Engine Brake"" mode, and it's for long downhill situations in the mountains.  Situations where there would be so much regenerative braking that it would overload the battery.  All I'm saying is to research ""B"" mode a little more."

electricvehicles,2pptwr,AbandonedTrilby,1 point,Fri Dec 19 17:13:18 2014 UTC,"The difference is that when you depress the brake pedal in the leaf, sometimes the physical brakes are applied along with the regenerative braking.  That ""sometimes"" varies based on how quickly you hit the pedal, how far you press the pedal, vehicle speed, and other factors.  Thus the ""blended"" brake pedal.  It's the same in the Prius.   Being able to control the amount of regenerative braking with a finger paddle (I'm thinking about the triggers on the Sega Dreamcast, that would be a great reference for how I'd like to see it implemented) without worrying about using the physical brakes would be great.    Say I'm coming up on a stoplight, nobody behind me, and I have a ton of distance before I have to stop.  I can use the finger control to regen brake until I slow down a lot, then coast the rest of the way in neutral.    Maybe that's not the best description of the feature, but it's something I've wanted in the Prius for years.  You can trick the car into doing it for you, but it's not ideal, nor is it easy.

Doing this gives me a full Regen rate until the speed of the car is too slow to adequately power the Regen system. I think separating the two makes things too complicated for the driver.

electricvehicles,2phe2r,dogphlap,17,Tue Dec 16 16:57:30 2014 UTC,"I could see this might be true if all energy production is from coal and the EV isn't driven economically. Some places burn natural gas which is fewer emissions, and some places use up to 35 to 50% renewable sources with no emissions.  For me, SDG&E puts about 1 pound of CO2 into the air for every kWh they deliver to me, and I average 4.7 mi/kWh in the EV. 1 gallon of gas produces 19.7 pounds of CO2.  You would need a car with 92.3 mpg to be as efficient as my EV with regards to CO2 emission.  Edit: the least efficient coal produces 2.18 lbs of CO2 per kWh. With my earlier driving habit that means a 43 mpg car would be more efficient with regards to CO2 emissions. If I drive at 3 mi/kWh, that would be a 27 mpg car.  So careless EV drivers coupled with the most inefficient energy generation would be comparable to the average light duty passenger car produced in 1985.   According to the U.S. DOT the average new light duty passenger car has a fuel efficiency of 36 mpg. However, the average US light duty vehicle efficiency is 23.3 mpg.

Also worthy of mention is that the grid isn't fuelled entirely by coal in any country, and in many places energy generation is only going to get cleaner with time. Another point is that most of these kinds of studies completely negate the vast amount of energy required to refine oil.

In Washington State, for example, I used the GREET model to find that EVs charged on their electric grid provide about a 70% reduction in GHG emissions relative to gasoline.  The other thing about EVs is that you can clean up their emissions by cleaning up the grid. When a coal plant goes offline and is replaced by natural gas, all the cars charging from that grid see a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per mile. That's different from a gasoline vehicle, where if it's 25 mpg the day you bought it, it's 25 mpg or worse every day after that.

The graph has what I'll call a vertical axis who's origin on the horizontal axis (air quality in terms of $ damage) is at a false zero i.e. not zero particulates and not zero O3. The origin is at the air quality damage a gasoline powered vehicle would produce per gallon. In that case the air quality damage from the diesel is -1 unit while the EV is at +18 units.  GHG is also shown on fig 3 but I have ignored it here (it follows the same pattern though).  From the graph:  damage from the diesel $0.46 for the energy equivalent of 1 gallon of gasoline.  damage from the gasoline $0.53 per gallon.  damage from the coal fired EV $1.95 for the energy equivalent of 1 gallon of gasoline.

It is about which vehicle technology is better at reducing particulate and ozone emissions.  I suppose these related but different goals can be at odds with each other if you are choosing to use less energy but derive that lesser amount of energy from a dirtier source.  I believe there is already research that states that if your electricity comes predominantly from coal, you may be increasing GHG and particulate pollution. [1]  I am curious as to how they compared the various vehicle types.  At the moment, EVs are not just using a different energy source but tend to also be much more efficient overall, by employing technologies, such as narrower, low rolling resistance tires, more aggressive aerodynamics, and more efficient accessories that are only slowly finding their ways into gas powered cars.  If the paper assumes the same energy usage but through different sources and paths, it may not be representative of the personal decision one might make between an EV and a gas-powered car.  This website http://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_emissions.php lets you look at the powerplant mix in your area.

I just don't like taxpayer money going into researching FCVs because I think they exist mainly to keep gasoline purveyors happy.

There are more reasons why some cars, like the Volt, are ""quickly depreciating"" in value, but it's not just about gas prices.  The Volt came out as a $40k+ car with a limited battery range.  Aside from the battery, it's a freaking Malibu.  At that price, not too many people are going to buy a glorified Malibu.  Also, it's getting long in the tooth, and anyone who's done even the slightest research on it knows that a new version is around the corner, and could have a lower price point.  EV's are still so relatively new that no one really knows how they'll depreciate or appreciate in the long run.  But when the cost of the new model comes down year over year due to decreased costs, dealers are left with the choice of either trying to explain why the 3 year old car on the lot costs more than a new one, or cut the price of the 3 year old car.  It'll be interesting to see how this comes along."

electricvehicles,2pacw5,whatsomattau,5,Sun Dec 14 20:15:40 2014 UTC,"For the most part, you can use any of these systems.  It's just the card that car comes with.  For instance: I drive a BMW i3.  Along with the manual and warranty information, I got 2 chargepoint cards.  I can use those at any chargepoint station once I set up my account.  However, I also have set up a blink account on my own that I also use.  Chargepoint, blink and other companies are just different networks of chargers, but the chargers themselves are generally the same.  Most cars in the US (with the exception of Tesla), use a J1772 charger for 110, 220 or 240V charging.  So, you're not worried about the brand name of the charger, as long as it's the correct charger.  There is also a different kind of charging that's referred to as Fast Charging.  You will see some differences here.  While DC Fast Charge was just set up as the US standard, some cars use different fast charge systems (CHAdeMO being the most popular other charger).  So, if I were to pull up in my BMW i3 to a fast charge system and it was CHAdeMO and not a DC Fast Charge, it wouldn't work.  These chargers are less common though, and most places that have one will soon have both.  TLDR: The network doesn't matter as long as it's the right connector/charger"
electricvehicles,2pacw5,ktagly2,2,Sun Dec 14 21:28:37 2014 UTC,"If you say 'fast charging' when you mean anything over 20kw, aka DC Fast Charging, aka 'Quick Charging' aka 'Level3' aka 'supercharging' aka '30 minute charging', you're gonna have a bad time.  Because for a long time, when the industry said 'fast charging' they meant 3-6kw AC aka Level2.  (They said this because they were ""fast""er than than the standard American household outlet, aka ""trickle charging"" of which I can only say it's better than nothing.)  (To add another wrinkle, European cars are blessed with the ability to drink 40kw AC, so in EU you can have a 30 minute charger which is not a 'DC Fast Charger'. Some sort of patent issues hold US cars back in this way, I think; I welcome an explanation from anyone who knows the backstory.)  Pretty much the only way to clearly and usefully label a charger as simply as possible (the only 2 things you need to know) is to give the max kilowatts and the plug format.  The kw number is quite simply the speed of the charger, and the plug format tells you whether or not it works with your car.  (There are only 4 major formats to worry about: J1772, J1772 Combo Charging Standard aka ""CCS"", Chademo, and Tesla Model S). But seeing the kw means possibly seeing a 2 digit number and doing 6th grade math (kwhr of your battery / kw = charging hours) to know your charging time and people can't handle that I guess!  The only exception to this is plain old electrical outlets if you bring your own cord.  In that case, all you need to know is Volts times Amps = Watts.  And there are bunches of outlet types.  There's just a few major ones but there are enough outlets in the world that if you don't mention one of the minor types you are not mentioning thousands or millions of outlets."

Essentially, the point is to set up accounts with everybody, because unfortunately even though you can use a credit card at many candy vending machines, they don't have that option for charging your car. [eye roll]  NRG's eVgo is the only one I'm aware of that charges a subscription fee. For me it's $40/mo for unlimited charging, which is fine if you regularly use the chargers, but if you only hit the level 3 once a month or so, then it's not a great deal. Without a subscription, you have to call the number on the charger, navigate the phone tree, tell a rep that you want to buy a one time charge, get sent to another person to take your credit card info, get sent back to the original rep who eventually turns on the pump.   I asked if they had a pay as you go key fob so I could just pay without having to spend 15 minutes trying to turn on the charger, but they said they didn't offer that in Texas.  For everybody else, just get accounts with everybody. They're free and only charge you when you use them. Using the chargers without an account can be done, but it will cost you more in most cases."

electricvehicles,2pacw5,samcrut,2,Mon Dec 15 02:42:48 2014 UTC,"That's not true. Level 3 charging usually costs $5-10 per charge. The amount of electricity provided is around $2.   On level 2 charging, they might have smaller charges, but nothing says they have to give away the transaction fee for free. Charge accordingly. Like I said, vending machines take credit cards. If I can buy a $1 bottle of Sprite on plastic, then I can sure buy electricity.  The municipal roadblock is that there are typically rules that the electricity distributor has the exclusive rights to sell electricity by the KWH. Companies aren't allowed to resell electricity by the same unit of measure they use to buy it due to outdated regulations that need to be changed to be more specific. Sure, you don't want your landlord profiting off of forcing you to pay double for the electricity in your apartment, but this is a new situation that needs an exception.   Not having credit cards for payment is just a matter of wanting to lock people into using their network of chargers which I think they're seeing now isn't working, but now they have all those chargers out there that don't have any card swipe readers on them. They gambled on brand loyalty and lost. Nobody cares if it's Blink or AV. They just want juice wherever they are."

You can easily start a session with your ChargePoint card, using the ChargePoint mobile app, with an RFID credit card or by calling driver support at 888-758-4389. The 888 number is listed on each ChargePoint station and on the back of your ChargePoint card. Edit: I did read somewhere on the Tesla forums that they were only able to get L1 charging with just the credit card. I don't have any RFID cards, so no way to test it.   BTW This:   They can't use credit cards because the credit charge to the vendor is often equal or greater than the retail cost of the electricity/charge.   And tthis:   Well, they all take credit cards on file to charge you for service. I meant card swipes.   Dont make sense together. They pay the credit card company either way.

electricvehicles,2pacw5,samcrut,1 point,Mon Dec 15 05:28:54 2014 UTC,"Well, I guess that's a start with ChargePoint taking RFID credit cards.  The difference on the latter part is that if your card is on file, they can charge you once a month or so and lump several sessions into one transaction fee instead of a transaction fee for every session which is what they would have to do with a point of sale swiping system."
electricvehicles,2pacw5,ImTheDerek,1 point,Mon Dec 15 07:21:28 2014 UTC,"Chargepoint gets around that by having minimum session charges, which is probably why you can still charge without an account. The collective amount of money that sits in accounts is probably the bigger picture. The interest they can earn by having a floating amount of cash on hand probably more than makes up for the processing fees. That is probably why they limit charging to L1 - to get you to sign up and have your account reload whenever it drops below $10.  So basically every account that ever uses a paid station will have at least $10 sitting at any given time."
electricvehicles,2pacw5,samcrut,1 point,Mon Dec 15 07:34:54 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think it was that way when I signed up. What I read earlier today was that it's no charge until you use a charger.

There is a lot of buzz about the new 2015 Volt being released at the Detroit auto show in January. If you are not in a hurry - wait a few weeks until it is released   It will be the second generation of the vehicle - and that means a lot of improvements usually. Look at the second Prius for example

The map it shows - even in highly accurate mode does not include Bayfield WI. But if I ask google for driving directions from Wausau to Bayfield it says 185.2 miles.  It does do a good job of not allowing me to drive into lake superior and most of lake Michigan - But the Bay of Green Bay seems fine for driving on over/through. If this tool actually looked at roads you would think that that major waterway/inlet would be off limits.  Also high accuracy takes a really really long time and doesn't appear to provide an outline that is any more accurate/detailed. I would expect the max distance outline to be wavier due to calculating routes using more smaller roads."

electricvehicles,2oqcdu,eleitl,3,Tue Dec 9 17:39:59 2014 UTC,"My workplace has a large campus and over 100 employees with EVs. They have various charging infrastructure that is generally free to use.  Where I currently work there is about 5 EVs that share 2 designated EV parking spots, serviced by 1 240v and 2 120v plugs on the same (I'm guessing ~50 amp) circuit. Usually we get there early enough in the morning to turn the 2 designated EV spots into 4 spots by parking on either side of it. There are plenty of spots in the lot so this isn't really a problem.  Other buildings have Blink, Chargepoint, and most recently NRG stations. The blink ones usually require your blink card and still charge. The chargepoint is a tossup. It used to be free, but last I saw there was a fee being tacked on because the building is in a location where non-employees can easily park there. The newest buildings being completed have added a new parking structure with 8 NRG plugs servicing ~24 parking spots. They are all free. There's also 120v plugs in locations around some of the garages, sometimes marked with EV reserved, sometimes not.   This is in San Diego where energy is fairly expensive.  If workplace solar becomes a standard, and the business isn't getting what they expect from selling the energy back to the power company, I can see charging at work becoming the norm. If not free, then comparable cost to charging at home. If money is an issue, I can see stations for a business using employee RFID cards in order to start charging.  I'd also say single stations with multiple cords will also become the norm, to prevent less courteous employees from trying to skip the line or insisting they get topped up first. The station could be first come first serve or give priority to someone who has to leave earlier, and all that information being stored coming from the employee file and the RFID. Could also attach it to whatever intrabusiness messaging system is used to let users know when their charging is complete. If single cord stations are being used, maybe even get building/parking security involved and they can plug in whoever is next on the list."

electricvehicles,2oqcdu,b0ltzmann138e-23,2,Thu Dec 11 17:38:37 2014 UTC,"Possibly, as a wage incentive, a space with access to charging (powered by workplace rooftop solar or not) could become commonplace.   Perhaps with self driving vehicles, wireless charging at a shared parking garage where the  vehicles negotiate for the charging bays based on your need for range, time you expect to leave , credit in the co-op charging service, and so on.  The charging/ parking garage need not be at the workplace at all, merely in range of your workplace.  If it requires a high speed charge, an attendant or robotic plugin service could be available, so that you don't get caught out."
electricvehicles,2oqcdu,InfiniteBacon,2,Tue Dec 9 10:56:22 2014 UTC,"There are a lot of ways it could happen. I don't expect it to be common for quite some time(my tech company has zero electric chargers, if they installed level 2 chargers with free charging they would quickly become overwhelmed.) My company doesn't want to install chargers because that would just incentive vehicle who use expensive parking spaces. Bike and bus commuting does a lot more to save resources for my company & the planet.  Right now electric companies make a lot of money by charging businesses more for power generated during the day. I don't expect this to change quickly even if daytime wholesale prices drop.   120V charging which adds just a few miles per hour is easier/cheaper to implement and the amount of juice provided is small which makes giving it away as an employee perk the most painless option for businesses.  Level 2 charging at 10+kW will become the norm for most electric vehicles and businesses will be reluctant to pay for equipment/power for such systems so this will mostly be outsourced to companies like blink/chargepoint who will charge a time+kWh fee which will limit widespread adoption.  It is going to take a long time to shift the electricity pricing structure, with solar/wind installations and decommissioning of older power plants. By that time we will have self driving cars that people use as ride sharing commuter vehicles. Order a ride to work, step out your front door and a vehicle will be there in 5 minutes and cost about as much as a bus ride does today. It may pickup or drop off other passengers traveling on the same route which will increase vehicle ridership and ease congestion, you won't have to worry about car payments, fuel, insurance, parking. These vehicles will use automated charging locations installed throughout the city. We can reduce the amount of land used for parking in cities and develop that property or convert it to greenspace."

With all that solar, it will make a lot more sense to generate it where it will be used than to build a giant solar farm on the outskirts of the city and then send the power into the city via high voltage lines.  Even if ride sharing becomes extremely popular, someone will still own the car, which means it will need a place to park."

The convenience is to plug your car in while you work and come back at the end of the day, but eventually this hits one cord per EV driver, which simply cannot scale effectively, especially when the cars only charge for about half the day before being full.  I don't know what the answer to this is, but it is a bit concerning to me."
electricvehicles,2oqcdu,MuaddibMcFly,2,Tue Dec 9 15:45:52 2014 UTC,"At my company, the EV drivers created an email list to coordinate alternating who had the charger.  If you're at work for 8 hours, even if they're the same 8 hours, two people, at least, should be able to charge their vehicles.  Even at a 0.5C charging rate (so, ~42kW for a Tesla, ~12kW for anything else), one cord should be able to easily charge 3 to 4 cars in a given work day from Empty to Full.  Hell, it might even be worth having one of the office staff go out to change which car is plugged in every 2-3 hours.  Want to charge?  Leave your charging port accessible, park in one of the charging spots, and leave a card on your dash citing your expected departure time, and you'll get plugged in at some point while you're working."
electricvehicles,2oqcdu,b0ltzmann138e-23,1 point,Tue Dec 9 19:32:30 2014 UTC,"Or have a charging station with 2-4 cords, so that two adjacent cars can be charged at the same time."
electricvehicles,2oqcdu,MuaddibMcFly,1 point,Wed Dec 10 13:29:12 2014 UTC,"I'm not certain that buys you terribly much. After all, if you can unquestionably charge 3-4 cars over the course of a work day using one cord, wouldn't it make more sense to save the money on the infrastructure, and just have one cord at the nexus of 4 spots?"
electricvehicles,2oqcdu,b0ltzmann138e-23,1 point,Wed Dec 10 18:36:49 2014 UTC,THe price of the cord is small compared to the price of the unit. If you have 1 cord for 4 cars - you are only providing each one with 2-3 hours of charging. That might not be enough. Adding 1 extra cord means you can provide people with double the amount of charge for only a small bump in cost. Plus it makes the pain of scheduling everyone less severe.
electricvehicles,2oqcdu,MuaddibMcFly,1 point,Wed Dec 10 18:41:14 2014 UTC,"The price of the cord is small compared to the price of the unit.    True, and units have maximum kW throughput, right?  So if you've got a unit that supplies 42kW, and you've got one cord, your one cord is going to have 42kW of charging power (about 35 minutes, +/-, to charge a Leaf).  On the other hand, if that one unit is attached to two cords being used at the same time, then each cord is only providing up to 21kW of charging (or about 68 minutes, +/-, to charge a Leaf).    If you go to 4 cords on the same unit, you're looking at 10.5kW of charging each, or 137 minutes, +/-...  ...so you're not gaining anything by having more cables that you don't get from shifting one cable from car to car...  And even that setup assumes that the unit is capable of distributing the power according to the different feedback it's getting from several different cables.   you are only providing each one with 2-3 hours of charging   Yes, 2-3 hours, but 2-3 hours at 42kW is not appreciably different, when it comes to charging a battery pack, from 4-6 hours at 21kW.   Adding 1 extra cord means you can provide people with double the amount of charge for only a small bump in cost.    Not doubling the amount of charging, double the amount of hours charging.  You're still limited to the throughput of the charging unit itself, no matter how many cables you've got plugged into it.  A cable that is capable of carrying 60kW attached to a unit that puts out 42kW doesn't actually put out more than those 42kW, and adding a second such cable doesn't help, either.   In all such situations, you're held up by the narrowest choke."
electricvehicles,2oqcdu,b0ltzmann138e-23,1 point,Wed Dec 10 20:34:50 2014 UTC,"I hear what you are saying - that you are providing the same charge since the power is distributed among two units.  But the solution to that problem is creating a power unit capable of supplying more than one car at a time, not to provide more units.  If I had an electric car which I charged at work, I would rather park, plug in and walk away, and not have to think/worry/coordinate so much.  Another thing to keep in mind - slower charging is better for the battery.   Last but not least - we are talking about charging at work - it does not have to be a level 3 charger. A level 2 charger can be more than enough - since you have the benefit of being there for several hours."
electricvehicles,2oqcdu,MuaddibMcFly,1 point,Wed Dec 10 20:46:34 2014 UTC,"But the solution to that problem is creating a power unit capable of supplying more than one car at a time, not to provide more units   The real question is which of those is more efficient (power, environmental impact, costs...)  I mean, the ideal scenario, in my opinion, is a charging system where the car's on-board charging system can decide the wattage it wants, communicate that to the charging station, which then throttles the charging to match.  This would draw from a unit that would be able to supply 0.5C * number of plugs it has (based on the most common capacity of battery pack).  That way, a 4-Tesla charger have somewhere around 170kW, which allows full charge of an 85kWh vehicle as fast as anywhere from half an hour to 2 hours, depending on how fast the vehicle asks for the power and how many vehicles there are.  4 cars asking for 135kW would only each be given 42.5kW, but if one of them unplugs/fills up, the others would immediately bump up to 56.(6)kW.  Another being topped off would bring it to 85kW for the remaining two, and if there were only the one, it'd be charged at 135kW, with the other 35kW sitting idle....   A level 2 charger can be more than enough - since you have the benefit of being there for several hours.    technically, normally, sure.  But what if you're only working a half day?"

electricvehicles,2oo8ch,b0ltzmann138e-23,6,Mon Dec 8 19:15:16 2014 UTC,"Yes, when I bought a hybrid it cut my fuel costs in half. When I got an EV it cut my fuel costs in half again."
electricvehicles,2oo8ch,paulwesterberg,4,Tue Dec 9 00:45:40 2014 UTC,"Meanwhile, conventional gasoline cars are getting better-than-expected improvements in fuel efficiency via technologies like direct injection, turbocharging, and seven- to 10-speed automatic transmission.  Those technologies may mean that expensive hybridization looks less appealing as a way to meet corporate average fuel economy targets that rise steadily from now through 2025.   Hybrids are being supplanted by everything else. I have a Fusion Energi and a Cruze Deisel. The Deisel gets 50MPG, about the same as a prius and without the battery. The difference between regular hybrids and efficient gas engines is too narrow to justify the added expense for a lot of people. To put it in perspective, a new 2015 F-150 gets better mileage than the 97 Camry the Cruze replaced. Meanwhile, I'm getting about 90 MPG in my fusion with a round trip commute of 110 miles.   Here are some numbers: (from http://www.ford.com/cars/fusion/pricing/)  Using the Titanium trim, going from a regular to hybrid is $2,000 to go from 28MPG to 42MPG. For my long commute, is another $5k to more than double the hybrid mileage. For people with shorter commutes, the MPG difference is even wider.   Annual cost at 20k miles a year, $3.50/gal:   Regular: $2,500 Hybrid: $1,666   I run about 70% EV at an average 12c/kWh and the gas engine gets about 40MPG. EV is about 22 miles per 6kWh (3.3c/mi):   Energi: $525 gas $462 electric $987 total   Hybrid payback: 3 years  Plug in Payback: 7 years over hybrid, 5 years over gas  Keep in mind my commute is at the far end of the payback being reasonable. Anyone living within 20-30 miles of work will get a payback much sooner. And this is only one model I chose since its what I drive.   Taking all this into account, when you add tax incentives then buying a hybrid if there is a plug in model available is almost a negative investment."

electricvehicles,2oo8ch,ImTheDerek,1 point,Tue Dec 9 00:20:00 2014 UTC,I mean CA is requiring cars with mpge (plug in pure and hybrids)   http://dailysignal.com/2013/01/08/epa-gives-green-light-for-californias-costly-car-program/
electricvehicles,2oo8ch,Lonelan,1 point,Tue Dec 9 00:37:33 2014 UTC,"Thats not really the best way to put it. MPGe is simply a measurement of how many miles you get from the equivalent to one gallon of gas energywise in an alternative fuel. For example, about 34kWh (ive seen sources state from 32-36kWh) stores about the same amount of energy as one gallon of gas. a car that goes 100mi on 34kWh will be rated at 100MPGe.  The tax rebates tend to depend on electric range/battery capacity, not the MPGe rating of the vehicle. Regulations themselves take the range, the actual vehicle emissions, and durability (warranty) into account. the MPGe rating doesn't have anything to do with that.  As far as your article:   Proponents of alternative-fuel vehicles often claim that no one will buy hydrogen or electric vehicles without the charging station infrastructure in place. This rationale justifies more subsidies for alternative fuel-powered vehicles, whether it is biofuels, natural gas, or electricity.  But these types of investments should be for the market to determine; otherwise, taxpayers are going to be on the hook for a infrastructure that consumers aren’t going to use.   Thats actually psychologically not entirely true. People tend to resist change, even if it is illogical to do so. The idea behind these subsidies is to ""jump start"" the process. Case in point is how well hybrids sell in California, where they were heavily subsidized in the early stages, compared to the rest of the country.  I wasnt considering a plug in vehicle until I looked at what I would pay after the tax breaks compared to a gas/hybrid version. Now that i've owned one I can say that as long as they are available, I will never own a gas only or even a regular hybrid again. I would buy the same car if I were to do it again, tax break or not."
electricvehicles,2oo8ch,ImTheDerek,1 point,Tue Dec 9 01:02:30 2014 UTC,"That's some serious creep you got going on there. The point of me linking the article was outlining California's requirements for plug in (vehicles with an MPGe rating) vehicles.  I know what MPGe is.  My point was the cost of plug-in versions of regular hybrid cars that qualify for federal and state incentives usually cost an extra amount that is almost entirely offset by the incentive.  TL;DR: you already know the following, still putting it in for anyone else following along  For instance, Toyota Prius. Website says regular hybrid model retails for $24.2k. Plug in hybrid model sticker is $30k (29.9), difference of $5,800. Federal tax incentive on the plug in prius is $2.5k, plus the CA rebate of $1.5k, is $4k, or instead of the vehicle being $5,800 extra, now it's only $1,800 extra. Much easier to sell a ""you'll use less gas"" version for only that much more.  Here's another comparison. Ford C-Max. I'm gonna compare the SEL to the Energi model since the packages are closer than the standard SE model. SEL is $27.1k, Energi is $31.7k, difference of $4.6k. C-Max Energi qualifies for a $4,007 federal incentive and a $1,500 CA rebate, for a $5.5k discount. The Energi is technically cheaper than the non-plug in version, and only $2.1k more expensive than the base C-Max hybrid model.  So, with my original comments to the linked article, yeah, it makes a lot of sense for manufacturers to put a higher emphasis on plug-in and full electric models as California's requirements are for MPGe vehicles (as in, the plug-in versions and non-plug-in hybrids don't apply)."
electricvehicles,2oo8ch,Lonelan,1 point,Tue Dec 9 02:08:10 2014 UTC,"If you had just used the statement """"the cost of plug-in versions of regular hybrid cars that qualify for federal and state incentives usually cost an extra amount that is almost entirely offset by the incentive."" rather than referring to the fuel measurement used, it would have been less of a stretch to link your original comment to your point. Especially since manufacturers don't need to ""inflate"" that number (since the number itself doesn't have any bearing on the rebates). Never in a million years would I have made the connection myself and I still dont think your original comment really connects to what you said your point was... If I hadn't replied to figure out what you meant I would've just written you off as an anti-liberal whackjob lol.   My other top level comment and my last reply to you agrees with what I pulled out in quotes, so not really anything to add. I went a little further with my other top level comment, but in the end if rebates make the plug in cheaper than the hybrid then only people who would lose mileage due to long commutes and the heavier battery would buy the hybrid.   Personally I think by the time the tax breaks expire, battery costs will drop and the cost difference between the hybrid and plug ins wont be much and when you add in the fact plenty of gas cars get good mileage, I wouldn't be surprised if we see the death of the standard hybrid."

They'll end up putting in a much smaller battery overall and maybe have 500km range which is fine but it'd lower the cost of the batteries and bring them in at a cheaper price point and that'd be the major change that attracts many people to electric.  The only place we are going to be seeing huge range in electric cars will be in the sports cars and luxury.

While the cells in a Leaf are nowhere near as flammable as those used in models, look at the way that LiPo cells burn in videos on YouTube :-) They are like little rocket engines!

Most of them have been thermal runaway incidents related to the lithium-ion batteries and have involved the Zotye M300 EV, Chevrolet Volt, Fisker Karma, Dodge Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrid, Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, Mitsubishi i-MiEV and Outlander P-HEV. Most hybrid electric vehicles available in the market today use nickel-metal hydride batteries which do not pose the same risk of thermal runaway as lithium-ion batteries.

electricvehicles,2od6gl,b0ltzmann138e-23,11,Fri Dec 5 14:35:07 2014 UTC,"This charger is only 24kW which is fine and dandy for a small battery city EV like the i3, but not much of a competitor to superchargers which operate at a max of 135kW.   These chargers won't enable long distance EVs like the Model S. This is more of a competitor to the Leaf chademo chargers. Right now there are very few SAE combo chargers installed in the US(none in my state) so rolling out chargers is just BMWs way of trying to catch up.   I test drove an i3 earlier this year and the salesperson pointed out that the car can fast charge with the SAE combo port and I asked her what plans BMW had to get chargers installed and she said that BMW was working with a group of other manufacturers to get them installed. I said that sounds like design by committee and doomed to delays and failure.   It is good to see that BMW is doing more to support their EV, but this falls well short of targeting Tesla."
electricvehicles,2od6gl,paulwesterberg,2,Fri Dec 5 16:27:43 2014 UTC,"That depends on how you're targeting Tesla.   If you're trying to compete with them on their own turf (luxury EV with 250+ miles of range), then you're right, this isn't even close.  ...on the other hand, if you're targeting them in the sense of making EVs a viable option, with the sort of ammenities you've come to expect from a BMW, and recognize that most people won't need better than 60 miles of range in half an hour... well, then people would be more inclined to buy the i3 than a Tesla.     Especially given that for the price of decently equipped Tesla, a family could afford to buy an i3 and an X3 as their ""I'm going to be going on a long trip"" vehicle."

electricvehicles,2od6gl,Pirellan,1 point,Fri Dec 5 20:18:00 2014 UTC,"They are not upgradable. They could still charge a long range EV, but it would take hours of charging to refill the battery.   For instance charging the 85kWh model S batter would from empty to full with a 24kW charger would take 3.5 hours.  If BMW is smart they have designed the AC-DC converters in these chargers to be modular(Like Tesla onboard chargers are stacked together to build superchargers). That would allow BMW to stack 5 of these together to build a 120kW supercharger. Then building these chargers allows economies of scale to bring the cost down."
electricvehicles,2od6gl,paulwesterberg,1 point,Fri Dec 5 20:24:17 2014 UTC,Sorry I meant to ask if they could be upgraded to charge a larger battery efficiently.  I understood that they would take longer as is with bigger batteries.

Once you become a dominant player you get the pick of the best suppliers etc, and i would imagine the aim is to keep Tesla as a 'niche' brand by making it impossible for the Model-3 to be competitive."
electricvehicles,2od6gl,_Madison_,1 point,Mon Dec 8 15:12:57 2014 UTC,"The i3 doesn't really compete against the Model S/X. It might compete against the Model 3, though I expect that the Model 3 will have the edge in range, passenger/cargo space and recharging speed.  I think that the i3 is a great little commuter car and happy to see bmw owners turned on to the power of electric torque, but the electric vehicle market is still so small that most of the sales gains come at the expense of traditional ice vehicles."

For the most part, cigarettes in the US are sold in gas stations, pharmacies, and grocery stores.  Back when I was smoking, gas stations were the easiest places to get them.  Grocery stores take too long to get them, and pharmacies are more expensive.  If you don't have to stop at the gas station every day, or every other day, then your ""while I'm here"" reason walks out the door.

But I'm dismayed that the author knew he was writing an article for a technology magazine and didn't take advantage of any of the smartphone apps that would have helped overcome most of the issues he faced.   All of his screenshots were done post-facto from his desktop.  Plugshare almost always has detailed descriptions of the location of a charger in a confusing place like a mall or garage.   And all the public charging systems (SemaCharge, Blink, ChargePoint) have live availability updates, even though they are not perfect.      By the end of the article he has a Chargepoint.com screenshot, and finesses his complaint to be that you can't be sure somebody else won't beat you to the spot when you start driving toward it.  That's an interesting idea... reserve your EVSE before you arrive.   Imagine, though the frustration with pulling up to an EVSE to find it reserved and being unable to unlock it with your membership card.

electricvehicles,2o2xu7,AbandonedTrilby,1 point,Wed Dec 3 13:30:21 2014 UTC,"True, but part of this is a limited selection of plug-in models.  In cases where hybrid or plug-in models are available as options, the take rate is starting to pick up.  As an example: Ford Fusion has sold 283k units in the US YTD 2014. Of these, 31k were hybrids and 10k were plugins: 11% and 3.5% take rate respectively.  Ford makes a hybrid version available at every trim level, and the Energi model is available at the middle and top trim levels. The Hybrid is essentially a $3k option and the Energi is essentially an $8k option on top of the hybrid option.  Even in this case though, Ford packages some additional features into the hybrid and energi models. For example, the SE conventional gas comes with manual climate control, hybrid/energi come with automatic dual-zone. The Energi comes with leather-wrapped hand controls, auto-dimming mirrors, touch-based ICE, etc. While these options are nice, they drive up the cost of what is already a very expensive car."

Our Governor Scott Walker and his fellow republicans fully control the state assembly and senate so they can pass any laws they want and have opened the state up for bidness with special favoritism for campaign donors like Koch Industries and other fossil fuel interests.  He removed state incentives for solar, made it more difficult for new wind farms to be built and has allowed utilities to restructure rates to make it less affordable to install solar systems. Last year a budget projection showed that the state would have a slight budget surplus so he gave everyone a very small Tax cut(enough to buy a large pizza) while continuing to limit state aid to cities/towns so property taxes increased.  Now his election year budget manipulations are becoming apparent and the state has announced that there is a $2.2B deficit this year so because he has said he wont raise taxes he is adding ""Fees"" like this.

I have asked the Property manager about it, and having been to strata meetings with other owners I am sure they would be on board, but it's just that I have no idea how to get started. The leaf works with just a regular outlet right? It's just slower?  I have a 60km commute, with outlets available at my workplace where I can charge during the day, so that parts not a problem. It's that I know 120 km on one charge might be pushing the limits since I commute in the mountains with a wide variety of weather, so I would definitely need a charging capacity at home too for insurance."
electricvehicles,2nwo44,fooljoe,1 point,Tue Dec 2 03:14:05 2014 UTC,"I have no idea how to get started   As I mentioned in another comment, your first step should be to get some quotes from electricians on getting a 240V circuit installed at your parking spot."
electricvehicles,2nwo44,BraveRock,3,Tue Dec 2 09:05:02 2014 UTC,"I don't know of any apartment buildings that offer charging stations but I can give some advice.  If you get a station installed, make sure it is placed well away from the best spots. This will help cut down on resentment of good spots being reserved for a very small group of people.  Also make sure the charging station is placed where it can reach the most spots. Middle of a double aisle works well.   Finally, and probably most importantly, make sure the management of the property understands how little it costs to charge a car. It's only a couple of dollars at most to charge a car, which isn't even enough to justify a credit card charge system because it will get eaten up by fees. A ten to twenty dollar a month flat fee on the rent might make more sense.   Oh and look into state and federal rebates for installing a charge. Maryland will pay for about half the cost of an installation."
electricvehicles,2nwo44,fooljoe,2,Mon Dec 1 04:06:54 2014 UTC,"It's a numbered spot parkade, where each unit has it's own parking spot. So it would have to be in my spot, which has no space for any sort of full charger, I would likely have to simply use some sort of normal outlet plug in charging system, I've seen teslas that can plug in like that, and hope others do too.  The main problem is that any infrastructure, while it could be useful in the future, would be simply to satisfy my needs now, making it seem like a waste of money to the other owners to simply pay anything towards something that is only for my benefit."
electricvehicles,2nwo44,pwnicholson,2,Mon Dec 1 04:48:25 2014 UTC,"There's not really any difference between a ""full charger"" and a normal outlet as far as the cost or space requirements of installation go - they're both the same thing, the only distinction is whether the charging station is hardwired to the electrical supply or has a plug on it (and any charging station could be modified to work either way.)  If you have a reserved parking spot, then your biggest hurdle is cleared. The next problem is of course getting approval for having the circuit run to your spot, and finding out how much it will cost. There have been some laws discussed and/or passed recently that disallow HOAs or complex owners from stopping you from installing a charging station, but the cost might be steep.  I would get a few quotes from electricians before you do anything else. Just tell them you want to run a 50 amp circuit to your parking spot. The actual installation of the charging station is a snap once you have the circuit installed, so you don't even need to bother mentioning that. It could be that your electrical service can't handle 50 amps, so you could get by with a 40 amp or 30 amp circuit if need be - that'll just limit your options when it comes time to pick a charging station and cause charges to take a bit longer, but that's no big deal."
electricvehicles,2nwo44,fooljoe,2,Mon Dec 1 05:06:57 2014 UTC,"120V instead of 220V wiring and a standard outlet vs a box that's 16"" x 18"" x 6"" at least. Many are larger.   I'd say that's a fair difference between a L1 and L2 charger, which I think is what OP was referring too. A L3 charger is quite a bit larger and basically requires it's own service line drop from the electric company.   A L2 charger is probably doable, but it is a good bit different than just doing L1 charging off a standard outlet."
electricvehicles,2nwo44,pwnicholson,1 point,Mon Dec 1 12:56:46 2014 UTC,"I of course was completely ruling out the L3 option (even though OP used the term ""charger"" which in actuality would only apply to L3) - that wouldn't make any sense for a home installation.   I'd say that's a fair difference between a L1 and L2 charger   I'd disagree. The EVSE itself is functionally and can be dimensionally identical. Look at what EVSEupgrade.com does, for example. The only real difference is you'd probably (but don't necessarily have to) go with thicker wire for an L2 station, and of course you use a different breaker, but these concerns are really trivial. When you're installing a new dedicated circuit the process is the same whether it's 120v or 240v - the cost of labor far outweighs the small difference in material cost, so you might as well install a 240v circuit with as much capacity as you can without requiring costly panel/service upgrades (and those are not needed as much as you might think.)"
electricvehicles,2nwo44,fooljoe,1 point,Mon Dec 1 18:11:07 2014 UTC,"Depending on the setup... We're all speculating... But for L1 you can come off a standard 110V lighting or receptacle circuit that is likely already present as long as it is at least 20A and not already overloaded. That gets you decent L1 charging and you can do it yourself if you're handy and you never need to touch the panel.  L2 requires a dedicated 240V circuit at a minimum of 40A. The wiring alone costs more than double what 110V wiring costs, and you have to have more of it because you're going all the way back to the panel and can't tie off any existing circuits. It requires an electrician to install that new circuit in some places, you couldn't do it yourself if you wanted to."
electricvehicles,2nwo44,trentsgir,1 point,Mon Dec 1 18:50:22 2014 UTC,"L2 requires a dedicated 240V circuit at a minimum of 40A   No it doesn't! L2 just means 208-240V - you can charge on L2 at as low as 6A (I've done it!) You can also find existing 200-277V lighting circuits to tap off of (someone in my parking lot at work managed that) and you can combine two out-of-phase 120V circuits to make 240V (I have an adapter to do just that.)  But yes, it's true that you're more likely to find an existing 120V circuit somewhere if you're looking to jury-rig something. That said, doing so would be a terrible idea for a long-term charging solution - you'd be hard-pressed to know just how loaded the circuit is (and when it's loaded), so you run the risk of tripping some breaker you might not be able to reset yourself (at best), or starting a fire, and that's if you manage not to electrocute yourself in the process. The high, continuous load of electric vehicle charging should not be taken lightly, and that's why you should always have a dedicated circuit for charging, even if just L1.  Hence the discussion should be restricted to installing a new circuit for charging, and again I'll reiterate my point: the cost (both materials and labor) of installing a 240V circuit need not be any more than that of installing a 120V circuit.  What does it take to install a new 20A 120V circuit? Two #12 conductors and a ground, a receptacle, and a breaker. What does it take to install a new 20A 240V circuit? Two #12 conductors and a ground, a receptacle, and a breaker! The only difference is it's a different type of receptacle and a different type of breaker, but the cost difference there is peanuts - probably less than $20. Also, if you're up for doing the installation yourself it's just as easy either way -  just attach two wires to the breaker instead of one to the breaker and the other to the neutral bar - but I'm assuming that's not a possibility in OP's case.  Now, of course you can spend a little more to run thicker wire and install a higher-amperage receptacle and breaker. And you probably should - even if the cost of 50A-rated wire is double that of 20A-rated, the difference there will still pale in comparison to the cost of an electrician's labor for all but the simplest installs (and I'm guessing OP's install won't be easy.)"

I ended up installing a 220v line at my old house, but that's a pricey option."
electricvehicles,2nwo44,fooljoe,2,Mon Dec 1 04:53:22 2014 UTC,"Given what I've read in comments, this might not work for OP, but I chime in anyway since this topic may be of interest to others as well.  I live in a condo and intended to take advantage of a program that my utility sponsored which fully subsidizes the normal cost of a charger installation.  Then I discovered that due to our shared meter box and the distance of my parking space from it, the cost would exceed the subsidy, and it was more $$ than I was willing to spend.  Therefore, I trickle-charged using a plug in our garage (I park in the driveway; I just snaked the charger cord out under the door).  For two years.  It was fine.  It was so fine that I leased a new LEAF with confidence and will go the next two years doing the same thing.  I have a short commute so I don't really need to charge every day anyway; trickle charging is enough for me.  If I need more juice I have places in town I can go to get it done faster.  The only issue is that because I like to leave the charging cord at home, I don't have a charging cord in my car so in an emergency I can't trickle charge anywhere else.  I need to go to a station that has the right hookup.  But it's never been a big deal, and if I know ahead of time I need to trickle charge I can unplug the apparatus and bring it along."
electricvehicles,2nwo44,ToMetric,1 point,Mon Dec 1 14:28:38 2014 UTC,"Couple questions:  With the leaf, how long does it take you to trickle charge? Are the advertised numbers roughly correct?  Can you buy spare charging cords? Are they usable in regular outlets and charging stations?  They have one regular charging station free to public in the town I live in, and 3 tesla chargers (which might not be for anything but teslas).   The front runner for what I would want right now is a Leaf, as I currently own a Nissan and have grown to like the brand, and the price/distance on a charge seem workable for me."
electricvehicles,2nwo44,300lbNerd,2,Tue Dec 2 03:26:43 2014 UTC,"Oh, it's a bit hard to answer the question about charging time, because I don't really pay close attention.  I know my previous LEAF seemed to conform to estimates.  I'm not sure about my newer one.    You can buy another charging cord but when I looked into it they were expensive--hundreds of dollars.  Maybe they're cheaper now.  It's almost never been an issue for me, because if ever I needed a charge I just got did so at home or from a charging station (keep in mind your Nissan dealer will also probably have a charging station).  Charging stations have their own cord and ""nozzle"" so you don't need yours.  I don't know any LEAF owners who look around for random standard plugs to use their cord with.  I mentioned having my cord semi-permanently ""installed"" at home as a drawback because it potentially is one, but in actual practice as a LEAF owner for 26 months it's never mattered that it wasn't in my car."

I own and live in a condo. A condo run by a strata. A strata whose building current does not have the infrastructure to allow for independent plugs in the parkade for vehicles which may need to charge.   For me to be able to charge my car at home, I would first have to lobby the strata to allow for charging in the parkade (likely the easiest part), then get them to figure out a way to either install multiple power lines/breakers/hydro meters in the parkade to which I would be billed directly, as they cannot be wired to my other account directly (due to building code regulations).   On top of that, I then have to likely use a simple power plug charger, instead of a tower stand or any of the typical ones you see around as there is simply no space in my communal parking area for such a thing.   Basically, I really want one, more than anything, but I just can't figure out how to make it feasible, and any time I ask at dealerships they have zero info on how condo owners/apartment dwellers usually deal with this situation."

There have been suggestions that the new EM braking could support Left/right control.   but this an inherently inferior approach.   Sorry, I am too simple to appreciate the difference.

These systems have been out for 20 years making ""thousands of calculations a second"" or whatever bullshit line you want to make.  Applying a frickin brake to stop wheel slippage is far from ideal in a performance environment.    This isn't a race car.  It's a luxury car.  This isn't the ultimate system.

If you're asking me if locking differentials = 4WD, you don't know a whole lot.  I've been racing/driving AWD/RWD cars for a long time now.    Here's 1 simple example where this setup sucks - Going around a turn fast, the inside wheels have less traction than the outside wheels (due to weight shift, again, simplification).  You're going to start applying throttle at some point as you're exiting the turn.  Guess what, those open diffs are going to allow all kinds of wheel slippage on the inside.  But wait, Tesla has traction control!  So now you're hitting the brakes, which is going to possibly slow the car, and you may be overworking the brakes on a track setting.  Like I said, this isn't a race car.  It's a luxury car.  Just because Tesla says the Model S system is great doesn't mean it's the best.  Look, I understand people are geeked over the Model S.  That's cool.  I like their setup.  But this isn't the end all AWD setup by far."

Now the orange chargers will give you around 10 miles in 5 minutes. If you have a charger along the way, then stop off, plug in for a few minutes and you'll have plenty of charge.  That said, the best bet would be to plug it in at work with the 110V trickle charger that comes with the car. Every hour on that gives you around 4 miles. 8 hours at work will almost completely top off what you went through on your morning commute. The electricity usage will be about 8 KWh.

A used Leaf in Southern California will probably have lost 15% to 20% of its battery capacity over 3 to 5 years.  There simply isn't any real-world data on the heat-resistant batteries.  Kia Soul has an EPA estimated range of 93 miles but has no liquid-cooling, while e-Golf has an estimated range of just 83 miles and does have a liquid-cooled battery system.   In my opinion you're going to have a bad time if you're running the battery to its full capacity every day, just because you're going to worry about that last few miles.

The main one is drag - but less efficiency plays a role.
electricvehicles,2naa4w,stevejust,1 point,Tue Nov 25 13:13:02 2014 UTC,"80mph is about 9300 rpm. Optimum eff of the motor should be at higher speeds (I'm assuming this based on the eff graph for the EV1), perhaps closer to 90mph.  The new small motor apparently has a different eff graph, but I don't know what they did different. Different # of windings? Diff resistance wire? More care to avoid stray inductance? Designed to avoid saturation?  At any rate, the new dual system may provide some opportunity to extend the speed range of higher eff operation (Musk seemed to claim).

electricvehicles,2n2itr,voteforabetterpotato,22,Sat Nov 22 09:42:11 2014 UTC,"For larger energy usages, like cars, hydrogen does not make sense. First, they are promoting hydrogen as alternative to fossil fuels, and 95% of hydrogen coming from  FOSSIL fuels (natural gas)! Mostly from FRACKING. So hydrogen does not solve environment issues (unless you think fracking is good for environment), and nobody will produce hydrogen on large scale with electrolysis while cheaper alternative is available.  As for getting hydrogen from water, for hydrogen you have to put in 100kWh of energy to get 23kWh to move the car. In EV, for 100kWh, you get 70kWh to move the car. So hydrogen station creating hydrogen on site will use so much electricity that it could charge 3-4 times more electric vehicles. For example, electricity used to fill up 1000 fuel cell vehicles for 300 miles, could fill up 3000 electric vehicles for the same mileage.  1$ per gallon? No, price is 50$ for 300 miles. That is more expensive than a petrol car, and this is with 'cheap' hydrogen that is coming from fossil fuels, it can only get more expensive.  Who loves hydrogen? Big oil companies, because they produce it from fossil fuels, and fuel cell cars would let them keep their monopoly.  You can say, we will put solar panels, wind turbine or any other renewable and make hydrogen that way for 'free', but that also does not make sense, because with the same solar panels or wind turbines you can support 3-4 times more electric than hydrogen vehicles."

California gives the big 5 (6?) auto manufacturers for zero emission vehicles based on some arcane formula including a factor of Miles per Hour Spent Topping Up or some such.  So a Leaf, with CHAdeMO gets somewhere around 100 miles per hour of topping up.  On the other hand, if a fuel cell takes 10 minutes to fill up, and goes for even 50 miles, that's 300 miles per hour of topping up.

Transferring gas or liquefied gas under high pressure to a vehicle is also not easy.  Natural gas is cheaper and cleaner than gasoline,  existing engines can run it with relatively minor modifications. But getting methane into a vehicle is difficult and costly,  which is why it isn't common.  Hydrogen has an even higher vapor pressure than methane."

According to the Energy Information Administration, efficiency of Natural Gas generation in 2012 is, at best, about 45% efficient.    Compare that to Steam Reforming at 65-75% efficient capture of H2, and a fuel cell's efficiency of 40-60% (which can be brought to 85% with heat reclamation), the worst case scenario is 26% efficient, so, yeah, about 40% worse.  ...but that's comparing the best Electricity generation to the worst Hydrogen cycle.  Kind of picking and choosing, there, aren't you?  The worst efficiency of electrical generation from Natural Gas is closer to 29%.  And compare that to the upper end of Steam Reforming (75%) and optimal Fuel Cell design (85%), and you've got a 63.75% efficiency of a direct hydrogen cycle, or 45% better than direct electrical generation.  Or, if you want to be fair about it, comparing best to best, worst to worst, you get the following:  Relative Efficiency of Hydrogen Fuel Cells    Electrical Generation Electrical Efficiency Hydrogen Best w/Heat Reclamation Hydrogen Best w/o Hydrogen Worst w/o    Hydrogen Efficiency -- 63.75% 45.00% 26.00%   Combined Cycle 44.81% +42.27% +0.4% -42.00%   Internal Combustion 34.15% +86.68% +31.77% -23.87%   Steam 32.86% +95.00% +36.94% -20.87%   Gas Turbine 29.67% +114.86% +51.67% -12.37%    So if you look at the numbers, yes, comparing the worst efficiency of Hydrogen Fuel Cells, they're worse than Electricity, but only if you assume the worst fuel cell efficiency, and it's only as bad as you assume the best electrical efficiency.  Assuming you actually knew the facts (which what I was asking after), that, my friend, is what is known as ""Intellectual Dishonesty.""  Or, in the vernacular, ""Lying.""

She actually knows what she's doing, and was laying the groundwork for a more sensible miles-traveled tax on vehicles that proponents say would be more fair and more stable than gas tax.  Why not tires ?  Administering small taxes like this surcharge costs a lot relative to the tax revenue.    Separating out special surcharges at a tire store (or Costco, or Sears...) and collecting those might be more difficult and costly than collecting a fee from a Licensing agency office whose whole job is to collect money on behalf of State agencies.  I would personally love to see a much higher gasoline tax.   With fossil fuels, price seems to be the only thing that drives behavior.  The way I see it, if you could afford $4/gallon last year, you could afford $4/gallon this year but be funding construction and maintenance too."

electricvehicles,2mob5p,pkulak,3,Tue Nov 18 17:54:43 2014 UTC,"Transcript of interview:  Interview between Bianna Golodryga, Yahoo Finance anchor, and Mark Fields, CEO of Ford Motor Company  Golodryga appears from anchor desk at Yahoo Finance, Fields is speaking in front of F-150 assembly line. Yahoo Finance splash titles appear in square brackets.  [Ford CEO:  We're making a Tesla for the masses] [Innovation in the Auto industry]  BG:  Okay, let's then talk about innovation. Google's driverless car madee a splash this year, but now it seems to be getting a lot of regulation roadblocks. Meanwhile in the UK, they're allowing them on the road in January. Are we behind the curve on driverless cars ?  [Is US Behind on Driverless Technology? ]  MF: Well, I think overall when you look at autonomous vehicles, in our case at Ford, you're gonna see driver  assistive technologies migrate across our entire lineup over time.  And I think when you look back and look worldwide, I think we're still at that stage where we're doing alot of research. A lot of sensor technology is getting better, the infrastructure is starting to build,  data availability is becoming more prevalent.   So I do think that as we go forward our approach at Ford is to look at this as an opportunity for us going forward,  and that's exactly the way wer're going to look at it, both here and also in all the markets we do business.  BG:  I want to turn to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla. You've said that Ford could also build a Tesla.   Are you working on this ? What exactly is youre relationship with Elon ?  [Is Ford making its own Tesla ?]  MF:  Overall what I mentioned was, the question was, do we have the capability, obviously,  to produce electrified vehicles, and clearly we do, because he have a full lineup of electrified vehicles that have actually done well in the marketplace, relatively speaking, versus the rest of the industry.   We're Number 2 in the industry right now on electrified vehicles.  But we do have, we have tremendous capability in our organization and we're gonna stay focused on providing  that power of choice for consumers, Whether it's electrified vehicles, or gas-powered vehicles, or, or, or others, diesels, etcetera.  And Elon, I don't know Elon well, but I think he's done, Tesla has done a very good job bringing electrified vehicles into the consciousness of the American consumer.  And clearly Teslas approach is to cater to a high end consumer,  and our approach is to make sure it's attainable, electrified vehicles are attainable for the masses, and we're gonna continue along that path.  BG: Any interest in buying Tesla ?  MF: No, we're gonna stay focused on Ford.  [Detroit Bankruptcy Hearing]  BG:  Well Ford, obviously as we know is in Michigan, and US Bankruptcy Judge Stephen Rhodes recently ruled that Detroit could proceed forward with its bankruptcy filing. What does it mean for one of America's most iconic cities going forward ?  MF:  Well, I think the emergency from bankruptcy is another very positive sign of the momentum that's gathering force here in the region and as a company we're going to continue to support that financially, philanthropically, and also through volunteerism.  BG:  You and I share a common heritage, a Romanian heritage.   What would your grandparents think of that, of their grandchild now being head of one of the US's biggest companies ?  MF:  Well, you know, I think they're very proud, but I couldn't be more proud to be here at Ford leading, because for me it's just a tremendous honor to lead this terrific team and this terrific company that has 111 years of history and heritage. and I just couldn't be more honored to lead the team going forward.  I think, uh, that's terrific they have smiles on their faces, and that's great, and my approach is just to earn that every day.  BG:  The Land of opportunity, for sure.    BG:  Finally, you have two sons.  What are their favorite cars, and be honest with us.  MF:  [Laughs] Well, of course their favorite cars are Fords. They love, they love the Mustang as a matter of fact a few years ago when my son was learning to drive he said he wanted a Mustang and I said I'm not going to give a 16 year old kid a Mustang, and he looked me square in the eyes and said ""but Dad, I'll settle for the V-6"".  BG:  Or you could get him a used one, too, right ? MF:  Exactly  BG:  It's a big day for you, Mark, and we want to thank you for joining us. MF:  Thanks, Bianna   [Ford Rolls out new F-150]"

The state of Maryland should reimbruse us for much of that, but we have to explain that to the dealer, they are a little confused.

Ignoring the costs of the additional infrastructure.  I would like to point out, there are zero H2 energy storage plants. There are however Battery energy storage plants, a 32mw? at a wind farm (LG Chem).  Edit: I hadn't noticed, the Gemans etc have actually made a few small plants.

Why build a H2 energy storage plant when you can tap into existing infrastructure with magnitudes greater storage capacity? That combined with no direct/immediate end use for hydrogen if stored, that's why there are zero H2 energy storage plants. However, if fuel cell vehicles can provide a sufficient (and profitable) outlet for stored H2, the scenario changes."
electricvehicles,2mbb6c,ColinTetra,1 point,Tue Nov 18 23:03:15 2014 UTC,"Power to gas:       Power to gas (often abbreviated P2G) is a technology that converts electrical power to a gas fuel.  There are currently three methods in use; all use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen by means of electrolysis.  In the first method, the resulting hydrogen is injected into the natural gas grid or is used in transport or industry. The second method is to combine the hydrogen with carbon dioxide and convert the two gases to methane (see natural gas) using a methanation reaction such as the Sabatier reaction, or biological methanation resulting in an extra energy conversion loss of 8%. The methane may then be fed into the natural gas grid. The third method uses the output gas of a wood gas generator or a biogas plant, after the biogas upgrader is mixed with the produced hydrogen from the electrolyzer, to upgrade the quality of the biogas.  Impurities, such as carbon dioxide, water, hydrogen sulfide, and particulates, must be removed from the biogas if the gas is used for pipeline storage to prevent damage.

That's 20 hours of driving time, plus about 45 minutes refueling time.  Hydrogen promises comparable time.  Even with a Tesla, using their superchargers, that top up time becomes about 3 hours.

With my petrol vehicle, if I feel like driving the 160 miles to visit a friend, I quite simply do.  I hop in my car, spend 5-10 minutes at a gas station making sure I'm topped off, and I'm gone.  It's the difference between visiting a friend being something spontaneous, or something I have to plan and schedule.  Or what about the unexpected?  What if a loved one has an emergency?  On top of there being 3-4x the probability that driving across town to be with them will hit me when I can't get there & back without topping up, the topping up takes significantly longer.  With better battery technology, with chargers effectively everywhere you'd want to park, there will be even fewer scenarios where the range/charge time will be a problem.  That doesn't change the fact that these are real world scenarios I'm looking at from my life right now.  I've been trying to get away for an on-a-whim trip such as above for weeks, but things are too crazy for me to have scheduled it.

I'll defer to other redditors who use SFO, but I know if I'm willing to pay for parking at SeaTac there are usually a couple of EV charging spots open.  For a couple of months I ran the ""iEV"" Android app to predict my energy use for daily driving.   It's a pretty accurate estimator but didn't allow for the heater and defroster use.  In the Focus, running the heater full time will drop your range by 20-25 percent, so I always have a worryingly low guess-o-meter range until the windows are defrosted and I switch off the heat.  I bought a Ford because I'm an American car homer (though the Leaf is now assembled in Tennessee) and liked its looks better.   The price of the Focus EV continues to drop and it's competitive with the Leaf.  The things I'm jealous about the Leaf are:  better interior space, far better manufacturer committment to the product and community, dealership committment (and chargers), the No-Charge-to-Charge program, and the availability of DC quick charging on the high-end models.  The first day I bought my Focus EV I had to drive 180 miles and it took me 13 hours total.   During one of my stops, I was leapfrogged by a road-trip blogger in a Leaf using the quick charger.

They can, and do, demand much higher prices.    The widespread availability of the Leaf prevents any dealer from creating that kind of market effect.

electricvehicles,2m2dht,Shermanpk,3,Wed Nov 12 13:14:19 2014 UTC,"I've never seen EV battery capacity stated in amp hours, always kWh, but the conversion is simple enough. Divide the Wh capacity by the voltage of the pack and you'd get amp hours instead."
electricvehicles,2m2dht,BreadstickNinja,1 point,Wed Nov 12 15:39:36 2014 UTC,I must admit I don't look at EV's so much as large lithium-ion battery packs. But even looking at phones they measure in mAh. Although I suppose it is likely a a more automotive friendly unit kW/h than Amps that people have no idea about.
electricvehicles,2m2dht,Shermanpk,3,Wed Nov 12 15:43:15 2014 UTC,"Amp hours sucks as a unit of battery measurement, as it's an incomplete metric. You need to know the voltage to understand the battery's true energy output. You can compare phone (or car) batteries on an amp hour (or milli-amp hour basis), as the voltage output is typically the same. But when it comes to EVs, kWh is a MUCH better metric, as it's not specific to voltage.  It's sort of like talking about an engine's peak horsepower rating with and without talking about the corresponding RPM. I can say ""this engine generates 300hp and this other one generates 275hp,"" you might think the 300hp engine is better. But if I follow that up by saying that the 300hp engine has to run at 8500RPM to hit that number, while the 275hp engine can hit peak output at 4,000RPM, you would have a different opinion."

electricvehicles,2m2dht,psychoticguy,4,Wed Nov 12 16:02:24 2014 UTC,The Wh takes into account the voltage. 50 amp hours at 48 volts is different then at 3.2 Volts.   I think watt hours is a convenient one unit measurement to compare batteries

A phone with a 3,000mAh capacity battery sounds much more impressive than one with 3Ah or 11.1Wh.  Watt-hours (or kilowatt-hours) should be used for all batteries because the number is independent of the pack voltage."

electricvehicles,2m2dht,badcatdog,1 point,Wed Nov 12 19:30:57 2014 UTC,"This is sort of basic. The big Tesla advance is their cooling system...few companies were willing to put all these little cells in close proximity to one another, as the risk of a run-away reaction (and a fire) is very high. Tesla's approach seems to be safe (at least based on the data we have), and it's because of their cooling system (which is impressive).  But it's not as if no one else thought of packing a bunch of small cells in a pack...the other automakers were concerned about fire risks and unwilling to invest in an alternate approach.  What's more, the larger cell structure favored by Nissan, Toyota, etc. is developing nicely...we'll see better energy density from the larger cells soon enough."
electricvehicles,2m2dht,Lonelan,2,Wed Nov 12 17:26:09 2014 UTC,"Imagine you're an engineer. You don't know much about batteries, and you go to manufacturers to ask them to recommend  a cell.  Zero recommend the 18650, and tell you not to use them if you ask (this happened to Eberhard). They are a fire risk and expensive to assemble/test etc!  So you don't use 18650s.  The recommended cells have half or less the power density and are more expensive. To fit them in your car takes double the volume and are expensive, so you use less and design a low mileage low power car.  Eberhard was focused on making a sports car which required the spec of the 18650 and investigated what could be done to deal with the problems with the help of Straubel et al.  Edit: Also, coming from the electronics industry, they were used to the 18650, and expected them to continue improve."

Lower capacity EVs like the Nissan LEAF work great in commuter applications, but even with quick charging aren't especially convenient for trips exceeding 2x vehicle range. That's why they're best suited for urban/suburban driving as part of a multi-vehicle garage; use the commuter EV for the 95% of trips where it makes sense to do so, and use a gas vehicle or high-capacity EV for longer trips.  As cell pricing drops further, high-capacity 200 mile EVs will be price-competitive with plug-in hybrids, which will move to 40-80 mile electric-only ranges.

This means that they're subject to 5 different tests in different conditions (cold, heat, fast highway speeds, slow, etc.) The mileage that you get from EPA-rated range is generally on the low end.  Some cars have ""up to"" range, meaning that the manufacturer has provided the maximum range in best-case scenarios in their advertising.   Note that Mercedes may have claimed the B-Class EV could get 124 mile range, but that's not the EPA rating, which is just 87 miles. For the models not yet in production, I can guarantee you won't see those numbers after the EPA does their analysis.  You really should split range into two columns: EPA-rated range or ""predicted"" range. Otherwise, you're comparing apples and oranges.  Also, it's hilarious that you give the RAV4 EV's 6.8s and the BMW's i3 7s acceleration scores a red background. Sheesh, what's wrong with those? You've got cars in the same category getting awful 14s 0-60 ratings, which is a huge spread. Only acceleration under 4.5 seconds gets green? Nobody other than elite auto enthusiasts insists on 4.5s or under, and 7s feels plenty fast on public roads.  These are only things that I've noticed at first glance. But seriously, make sure EPA-rated mileage estimates and manufacturer or enthusiast mileage estimates are tracked separately, since they're going to be totally different."
electricvehicles,2lsko8,rav4evdriver,5,Sun Nov 9 22:54:57 2014 UTC,The range is a huge thing.  The i3 and B Class should get a very similar range and this chart makes it seem like the B class would blow it out of the water.

The government gives them incentives to produce these kinds of clean cars in the form of tax breaks-- so they do it, just to say they do it.  If they REALLY wanted to revolutionize electric cars they could.  Yes, PEOPLE want electric cars so of course they are going to sell them. But the majority of the market for BMW wont buy a stupid looking car, and they know it.  I am not saying that they are all evil- thats your own bias reading into my statements.  I am saying that history has shown that major car companies have no interest in changing the status quo.  You should watch a documentary called ""Who killed the electric car."" In it, they interview executives from GM who explain how they were instructed to make the EV1 for example, but, to make it not desirable on purpose.    I am not sitting with a tin foil hat- I understand how marketing and business work.  They are rolling in profit and they do wish to do anything to change that.  They want the tax breaks and advertising rights to say they have an electric alternative, but they would much rather sell you a 3 series.  When I bought my Volt. I had to first go to three dealerships to find one that was charged.  Even though I told the sales man, ""I am here to buy a volt, I want electric."" Three different people tried to steer me away from it and get a ""fuel friendly"" truck or suv.  Seriously. I was like, ""shut up and take my money,"" and they tried multiple times to sell me something else.  Now, why is this? Well, mostly because it requires almost no servicing, and dealerships make more money servicing cars then selling them.  In addition, every car on the lot had 0% financing for 4 years. Except for the Volt- GM offered no specials on that.  They go out of there way to make it harder to sell, because they dont want to."

CHAdeMo is downright unwieldy, and doesn't have the same power capabilities that CCS does.  I think CCS is the best and most adaptable standard overall. The reason why the Tesla connector is so small is because it only has to deal with DC; AC charging is accomplished with a converter in the cable. CCS is large because it has to accommodate both a 3-phase AC port with diagnostics and the two DC pins for fast charging. That means all cars can charge using the same AC connector, and those equipped with DC fast charging can additionally use connectors with the extra DC pins."

It appears as though Detroit Electric may actually produce some vehicles. This company could eventually produce a product or it could do the engineering required for an affordable electric drive-train and end up getting bought out by a major manufacturer.  It is possible that people could crowd-fund an EV, but Tesla went though many years of massive capital expenditures eating glass and trying to make payroll, layoffs etc. Right now, with various EVs already available on the market I just don't huge numbers of people willing to invest $500+M in a company when it takes 5+ years to bring a product to market.  Also all of their crowd funding premiums are super lame. I understand that when you are trying to raise money you don't want to waste a lot on premiums, but they could provide something of value, along the lines of: If you donate $100 then you get $500 off the price of the vehicle when it launches.

electricvehicles,2l99nu,ElucTheG33K,2,Tue Nov 4 18:19:37 2014 UTC,"It remains me a tv documentary on French TV, they were anti-EV from the beggining and gave some arguments against electric cars with comments from angry people that clam EV are a disaster for environnement and implicitly that Diesel cars, massively supported by the French gouvernment, are still better if ypu made a total end to end. But their principal argument was that France produce alsmost only nuclear electricity, so if we get more EV on the roads they will need to build more nuclear plants. At no point in the film they talk about using solar panel to charge an ev, it's like the only way to produce electricity is nuclear or coil. And for coil they've used the example of Germany and... China. The second argument against EV was that the lithium extraction destroy natural landmark in South America. Finally, amongst many other arguments that were taken sometimes out of context or in a very specific situation that do not concern all EV (mostly talking about outdated technologies) they have mad a test drive with a Leaf. Their plan: drive a 200km trip on the highway as the manufacturer says it can travel 200km and see what happen. Of course after 120km they were near the warning zone and only then they started looking for a chademo charger. And of course the only one they found was out of order. The worst was that the documentatry was full of mistake and misleading. I didn't get the point of doing this, it was just to make people that are no interested in EV to be even more agressive against EV owner and EV owner to loose credibility about the quality of their documentaries."

So there's no evidence to back up the claim that we can make more fuel cells + tanks than we can lithium ion batteries."
electricvehicles,2kw5yd,FelixVanOost,1 point,Sun Nov 2 04:28:11 2014 UTC,"I was saying this because tesla ended the battery agreement with Toyota and batteries are the limiting factor in (at least) Tesla's electric car plans.  I don't know anything about the world capacity to produce fuel cells.  However I would not exactly bet against hydrogen, because it would be created from natural gas, and the guys who sell that have deep pockets.  Pure speculation. Feel free to downvote."
electricvehicles,2kw5yd,mike413,1 point,Sun Nov 2 06:24:18 2014 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't mean to sound confrontational in my earlier post.  We can only speculate as to whether hydrogen will catch on, but I personally hope it doesn't for a number of reasons:  1) Hydrogen as a fuel doesn't make any sense from a thermodynamics point of view. It will always take more energy to produce hydrogen, transport it, then distribute it that it will to simply use the electricity to charge a battery.  2) There is no infrastructure to accommodate a hydrogen economy. This infrastructure will be expensive, take a long time to install, and it's really just another way for oil companies to have something to sell to consumers. Hydrogen fueling stations have none of the advantages of charging whenever you want wherever you want, and the costs involved will likely always be greater than with electricity. We'll always need electricity in our homes, so we might as well use that infrastructure to power our cars too.  3) Hydrogen as a fuel still has considerably more negative environmental impact, which is a key advantage of adopting electric cars. Producing hydrogen by electrolysis from water requires huge amounts of energy and will be extremely hard to accomplish on an industrial scale, so the hydrogen would most likely be obtained from natural gas. In that case, you might as well just use the natural gas to power the car in the first place. Electricity still has the option to be made from renewable sources cheaply and easily (even if it won't be 100% for a while); that's not the case with hydrogen."

electricvehicles,2kw5yd,sjleader,1 point,Fri Oct 31 23:11:20 2014 UTC,How exactly would Toyota do this when the best literally everyone else can do at anything approaching that price point is a compact car with under 100 miles?
electricvehicles,2kw5yd,ViperRT10Matt,0,Sat Nov 1 12:02:09 2014 UTC,"Telsa Model 3. 2016.  If they can do it with their resources, if Toyota wanted to, they could with theirs."
electricvehicles,2kw5yd,sjleader,2,Sat Nov 1 12:18:05 2014 UTC,"The model 3 isn't coming in 2016, people really need to get that out of their heads. Model X deliveries were promised in 2013 and they've been holding deposits since 2012- now they're saying late 2015 as a best case. And that's a car based on an existing platform and powertrain!   So don't say ""tesla can do it,"" because there's literally zero evidence that they can beyond an announcement that they're going to someday try.   If you're going to use a tesla benchmark, use a real one- 240 miles of range for $80,000."
electricvehicles,2kw5yd,ViperRT10Matt,1 point,Sat Nov 1 12:28:41 2014 UTC,"They are building a new factory is Nevada where the cost of the batteries will be reduced.  They know that the Model III will be game changer and Im sure if its not ready by 2016 it will be by 2017.  They already have their prototype. My point is Tesla is a tiny company compared the international resources of Toyota. If they wanted it- they could do it.  H cars make no sense. We do not have the infrastructure for the fuel and it really isn't cheaper than gas-- although environmentally is better.  No one will buy it because they wont be able to fill up anywhere, and then they will claim ""there is no market"" and go back to burning oil for another 50 years.  Short sided assholes. We need to support companies like Tesla so they can change the game.  Hes the only one who has had the money and balls to stand up against big oil-- and look at the political push back with states trying to make his sales model illegal despite their desperate cries for a ""free market.""  Don't bet against Musk- he builds spaceships in his spare time.  I think hes got the car figured out."

electricvehicles,2kwnn2,ViperRT10Matt,1 point,Sun Nov 2 14:50:05 2014 UTC,"'Electric' cars need to be an add on to existing vehicles. I can get the 'regular' v-8 in my camaro, or I can get the smaller v-6 with a prius like battery and recharge system. As long as the hit in performance is only slight, many people will go for the v-6 just like they do normally. The hybrid system might make it cost about as much as the v-8, but if it is expected to be driven by the wife and eventually the daughter then hell no I am not getting the v-8. Also cheaper insurance.   That should be an option for literally every vehicle. Do I want the 4banger, or the 4banger+hybrid for an extra couple o thousand bucks. People upgrade to the diesel for a premium all the time, and I would expect them to do the same if hybrid options were there as well.   Toyota literally needs to take the prius drivetrain and put it into all kinds of stuff. They already are.  ""Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD) is the brand name of Toyota for hybrid car drive train technology. It is used in its Yaris, Auris, Prius, Highlander Hybrid, Camry Hybrid, Estima, Alphard, Lexus RX 400h/RX 450h, Lexus ES 300h, Lexus GS 450h, Lexus LS 600h/LS 600hL, Lexus CT 200h, Lexus IS 300h, Lexus HS 250h and Lexus NX 300h automobiles. Toyota also licenses its HSD technology to Nissan for use in its Nissan Altima Hybrid. Its parts supplier Aisin Seiki Co. offers similar hybrid transmissions to other car companies."""
