vexillology,3dwvdg,frederli,8,Mon Jul 20 07:39:02 2015 UTC,"The flag was a tricolor structured in a way suggesting the Nordic cross applied on the flags of the Nordic countries. The colours (blue, red and yellow) are commonly used on gáktis - the traditional Sámi garb.    The basic structure of Persen's flag was retained, but Båhl added the colour green - which is popular on many South Sámi gáktis. These four colours have been known since then as ""the Sámi (national) colours"". She also added a motif which derived from a sun/moon symbol appearing on many shaman's drums. While drawings on shaman's drums were only made in red (using an extract of the sacred alder tree), the motif on the flag uses both blue and red - the first representing the moon, the latter representing the sun. Pantone colour formula is: red 485C, green 356C, yellow 116C and blue 286C."

When he raised his arms the Danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired and he let them fall, the Estonians turned the Danes back. Attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again and the Danes surged forward again. At a second he was so tired in his arms that he dropped them and the Danes then lost the advantage and were moving closer to defeat. He needed two soldiers to keep his hands up and when the Danes were about to lose, 'Dannebrog' miraculously fell from the sky and the King took it, showed it to the troops and their hearts were filled with courage and the Danes won the battle.""

A Muslim state means a state that has a Muslim majority population.  An Islamic state means a state that has a local culture and identity strongly influenced by Islam, but officially it doesn't have sharia -at least fully-.  An Islamist state means a state with Sharia for everything that wants to impose Islamic laws on everyone inside its borders.  Syria in its early days was lightly Islamic.

I put 7 stripes of red for the seven HP books.  For the other 3, though, i didn't want to use the same pattern for all, as I thought it'd be kind of boring, but the designs are kind of arbitrary. Slytherin's 4 quadrants remind me of historic flags of lineages of Kings in Europe, so i thought it'd fit with the whole ""purity of blood"" theme in the house. Hufflepuffs are kind of the simplistic people in Hogwarts, so a simple and clean design that puts both colours as main fits very well, also symbolising the ""we're all equal"" mentality. Ravenclaw is more of a personal one, since it's my favourite (as well as the one i got sorted into in Pottermore); my name is Jorge (George in Spanish), so i put the cross of St. George to sybolize the house."

All the students names were Slavic in the books anyway and there was nothing literally nothing I recognized from the books and I am Swedish. I think this is some myth that just gained traction because the school is specified to be located up north, but Russia is north as well. If Rowling ever said something to verify this it just stinks of spur of the moment/no afterthought comment.   Scandinavian culture is not very close to Slavic and I have a hard time seeing why these two parts of Europe would combine to form a school. Scandinavian/Nordic countries would probably strive to create a school for its own culture/area if however the number of students was too low I would think that Germany and Austria would be the most compatible countries culturally.  The only theory that could lend some credibility to this unholy alliance would be if the school had its roots in the Viking age when Swedish Vikings traveled deep into Russia and Ukraine and established good relations. I don't know if a school founded at this time would be older than hogwarts which would be the oldest school in Europe."

vexillology,3dq2h9,arnaudh,2,Sat Jul 18 09:57:50 2015 UTC,"A word about French régions: although some follow more or less the borders of historical regions (Alsace, Brittany), administrative régions are a fairly recent creation. While there were regional entities in France since the early 20th century, they didn't hold much power until 1982, when 22 administrative regions were created and given local governments with elected representatives. Their flags, when they exist, are therefore contemporary creations (with the exception of Brittany's), even though they often borrow historical design elements. Régions are the sum of given départements (smaller districts created in the 18th century). No département can belong to more than one region.  Also note that starting on January 1st, 2016, the current 22 region system will disappear, and instead be replaced with a 14 region map. Expect new emblems and flags to pop up in here.  A handful of those regions (Brittany, PACA, Aquitaine, Pays de la Loire, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, Ile-de-France) will remain unchanged in their borders."

However it was changed to red as the flag of the Batavian Republic, specifically to mimic the French flag.   So the modern Dutch flag is a sideways French flag.   EDIT: See /u/Argyrius' comment. I'm wrong"
vexillology,3dmt3c,KangarooJesus,3,Sat Jul 18 07:24:07 2015 UTC,"No, the red-white-blue was already in use by the Dutch merchants about two centuries prior to the French revolution. I'll copy my comment from another thread:   According to one theory described on Dutch Wikipedia, the red-white-blue was used already before the Netherlands was established as a country, by the count of Holland, who drew the colours from his coat of arms (the red from the lion of Holland, the blue and white from the Bavarian roots of the count). When the Prince of Orange became prominent in the Dutch resistance many changed the red of the ""Hollandsche vlag"" (Hollandic flag) to orange, which led to the Prince's Flag. The merchants (the Dutch East India Company and Dutch West India Company) for example never used the Prince's Flag, but instead always continued using the Hollandsche vlag. The navy however did use the Prince's flag at first, and later varied between the two flags.  It was called the ""Hollandsche vlag"" until 1664, when the province of Zeeland protested that the States-General of the Netherlands called the red-white-blue that way (Holland was only one of the seven united provinces of the Netherlands), and then the name became the ""Statenvlag"".  Around 1650 the Statenvlag became the official flag of the Republic.   Look at this painting from the first half of the 17th century. It flies both flags (picked this one since you can clearly see that the one is orange and the other is red)."

The field is divided using a wavy line to represent the shore's breakwater.  The Raven Trussed represents historic Tywyn, as the raven was the family emblem of Philanthropist John Corbett of Droitwich, an industrialist and politician of the Victorian era, who resided part-time this area in the mid-late 1800s and whose generosity saw amongst many other things, the construction of a seafront promenade, for the benefit of the town. The Raven, though originally from the Corbett family crest, is accepted by locals as an emblem of Tywyn, due to it being installed on building constructions funded by Corbett, and the bird can still be seen on numerous buildings in and around the town today.  The Dolphin Naiant signifies the visits from Bottle-nosed Dolphins which Tywyn frequently enjoys. The animals are a regular feature of our coastline during the summer months, using our sheltered Cardigan Bay to nurse their young, much to the delight of locals and visitors. Both charges face left, a nod to the West coast of Wales on which Tywyn nestles.  The flag was desinged by Jenny Stevens & introduced on the 18th May 2013."

vexillology,3difpf,1tobedoneX,3,Thu Jul 16 18:06:17 2015 UTC,"Back in the 17th century, the orange dye was a mixture of yellow and red dyes, and the yellow dye went out first, leaving the red. For whatever reason - either convenience (they already used Red-White-Blue as a flag, so why have two official flags when you can just have one?), or being too lazy to change out the flags, or another sort of reason, they just made the modern one official.  Also, the Prince's Flag is sometimes used by Neo-Nazis, because they like taking beloved symbols and screwing it over heavily."
vexillology,3difpf,Argyrius,3,Thu Jul 16 18:37:17 2015 UTC,"According to one theory described on Dutch Wikipedia, the red-white-blue was used already before the Netherlands was established as a country, by the count of Holland, who drew the colours from his coat of arms (the red from the lion of Holland, the blue and white from the Bavarian roots of the count). When the Prince of Orange became prominent in the Dutch resistance many changed the red of the ""Hollandsche vlag"" (Hollandic flag) to orange, which led to the Prince's Flag. The merchants (the Dutch East India Company and Dutch West India Company) for example never used the Prince's Flag, but instead always continued using the Hollandsche vlag. The navy however did use the Prince's flag at first, and later varied between the two flags.  It was called the ""Hollandsche vlag"" until 1664, when the province of Zeeland protested that the States-General of the Netherlands called the red-white-blue that way (Holland was only one of the seven united provinces of the Netherlands), and then the name became the ""Statenvlag"".  Around 1650 the Statenvlag became the official flag of the Republic."
vexillology,3difpf,Phalanx300,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:09:12 2015 UTC,"Indeed, also seems to make more sense than the paint color theory. Makes me appreciate the red color somewhat more because of its age. However I didn't see an explanation from the transition from light red/blue to dark red/blue. Maybe its tied from going from a Republic to a Monarchy?"
vexillology,3difpf,Argyrius,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:37:01 2015 UTC,"Personally I appreciate the red more than the orange, because that's the colour that I've always known, and orange is kinda the colour of our royals, not necessarily of our state.   I've heard a couple of reasons for the change (too lazy to find references). One of them was that darker colours are easier to see at sea, which of course was very important for us during the Gouden Eeuw. On paintings of ships from that age the colour blue varies, it is not only light blue or only dark blue, so maybe by the time the connection to Bavaria (which was light blue) was lost the shade of blue was not really defined? Another one that I remember was that the colours were gradually changed by the Patriot republicans to match the colours of the French flag because of the revolution (which I personally don't really believe since our colours are darker than the French colours)."

vexillology,3difpf,Phalanx300,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:42:16 2015 UTC,"The red design is older, representing the colors of the county of Holland (red) and the Von Wittelsbach familly (white-blue) which ruled it at a certain time. During the Dutch revolt some revolutionairies replaced the red with orange, obviously because of William of Orange which leaded the revolt.  Both flags have been used for centuries basicly. Red version only become official slightly before WWII, because the Dutch nazi party wanted the install the orange version as the official flag. I believe images from the liberation show that when we were liberated many people still used the orange flag.   The red/orange struggle can also been seen as a political thing. As the orange represents the ""royalty"" and the red the ""republic"", search up on Statists/Orangists for more on that."

vexillology,3djdsq,lacourzan1995,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:32:41 2015 UTC,I thought about Benin.  Working with the deep red that was in the original flag was difficult.  It literally makes everything else look bright but then it also pulled the darker colors down with it.

I think that the river taken from the Chesapeake logo represents our agriculture and the stars for the six boroughs representing our industry. If this was cleaned up by someone better at graphic design it could look close to the old flag but follow more flag design principles. Criticism welcome.

The plow: Means that the Municipality of Villa Nueva, since its founding and for much of its history, has agricultural potential for being a very fertile land.  Gear: It represents a new era, in which during the years 50 (1950-1959), began the stage of industrial development with the arrival of companies that led countless jobs for the villanovana family. The gear background reads ""Best that wealth is culture"" which implies that culture is a value for the villanovana society, still above material wealth.

The first flag is the City of Louisville's flag, while the second flag is the flag of Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government.  This was a case of a merger between Louisville and its surrounding county, Jefferson. At the time of the merger, more people lived in Jefferson County than in Louisville. Given that, it wouldn't be just or right to keep the Louisville flag to fly over all the people of Jefferson County, and the resulting flag, while yes, a terrible SOB, represents that compromise.  Flags are created through political processes, and we have to be cognizant of that.  The other thing is that while the City of Louisville's flag is better than the flag of Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government it isn't a particularly great flag. It's the same navy blue you find on hundreds of municipal flags and dozens of state flags. The 13 stars aren't particularly unique to Louisville or Kentucky, and the fleur-de-lis are the best part - but the two elements are totally disconnected (why not surround the fleur-de-lis with the stars, at least). Yes, it ranked high on NAVA's survey of municipal flags, but I think that speaks more to the quality of its competition than the flag itself."

vexillology,3dbl1e,kjmitch,12,Wed Jul 15 01:00:02 2015 UTC,"Brown and gold, along with the bucking horse and rider, are representative of the University of Wyoming. Because it's our only University-level institution and team, and because Wyoming is essentially a very spread-out small town, the state does identify very strongly with UW's symbolism, so I agree that this is a perfect way to represent the entire state.  I don't mind the red and blue, myself, and I've seen places that sell Wyoming and UW apparel start to feature a version of the current Wyoming flag on hats and shirts with only the state seal removed, and that has been popular as well. Really, the only thing holding back our flag is the damned seal, unlike the hot-mess state many other state flags are in."
vexillology,3dbl1e,dodelijk,5,Wed Jul 15 01:18:10 2015 UTC,"As a life-long Wyomingite the red and blue doesn't really appeal to me, especially since the flag is almost always flying below the red white and blue American flag.

vexillology,3ddl5v,thomasfoster96,2,Wed Jul 15 13:03:44 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston,_Tasmania#Flag):   The three intersecting lines in the flag represent the city's three rivers (North Esk, South Esk and Tamar) and the two rectangles in the lines represent tin ingots. The strip across the top with the jagged edge is green to represent the city's parks, gardens and surrounding countryside. Waratah flowers at the top symbolise all flowers and similar beauties of nature. The ingots are included because Launceston used to be a large tin smelting centre. The little circle at the river junction is Launceston.   As far as city flags go in Australia, Launceston's is used quite a lot."

vexillology,3ddl5v,aceROB,2,Thu Jul 16 15:07:39 2015 UTC,"Likewise about the waratah. I'd think that Launceston should focus it's flag just on the rivers. Alternatively, they could adopt this lovely flag..."
vexillology,3ddl5v,adhdrescue,2,Thu Jul 16 15:17:59 2015 UTC,"Ha. That would probably cause a minor revolution in Tasmania.   I think the ingots could probably go as well as the waratahs and move the green to the centre circle (which probably should be bigger, Launceston's quite a lot larger in area).

Aragon and Castille had each own's citizens, laws, armies and political structure. They were not a state just beacause they were ruled by the same dude and this is a clear anachronism and misunderstading of how a monarchy functions"
vexillology,3d9w79,Mainstay17,7,Tue Jul 14 17:12:24 2015 UTC,"Explanation of Motifs  I don't remember who, but I saw a redesign attempt with the pentagonal stars that I have here. I took them to symbolize the five boroughs of New York City: Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the Bronx. This is preserved. However, the other attempt had orange stars flanked by two blue bars, assumedly to symbolize the Hudson and East Rivers. I thought that seemed too Manhattan-centric since it is the only borough surrounded by both, so I reverted it to the classic tricolour (see below). The five stars also symbolize the five bodies that have governed or currently govern the city: the Lenape, the Dutch, the British, the Americans, and the State of New York itself.  The grey colour of the stars symbolizes the steel that was and continues to be so instrumental in the building of the city.  The tricolour of orange, white, and blue is similar to that of the existing flag, but I have flipped and changed the colours to be closer to those of the Dutch Prince's Flag, flown by the Dutch revolutionaries in the Eighty Years' War, which is the basis for the city flag's actual tricolour.  An alternate version features the red, white, and blue tricolour of the actual Dutch Republic (the Statenvlag) at the time, along with their colony of New Netherlands (i.e. New York). I think it works just as well, and also might be more relevant to go along with the red-white-and-blue USA theme."
vexillology,3d9w79,McCourt,3,Tue Jul 14 17:19:27 2015 UTC,"I think you should flip it back (the choices are between making it look more Dutch, or more New York, so the answer is obvious, I think), and pick either blue or orange for the stars. Three colours is already plenty.  Iron is only grey if it's not exposed to oxygen, otherwise, it forms iron oxide (which is orange), and steel can be 'blue', so no need for an extra hue."

vexillology,3d9w79,edwartica,2,Tue Jul 14 20:56:24 2015 UTC,I agree. It looks a little out of balance with the stars either orange or blue. They need to be their own color.

vexillology,3d8opg,waiyd,4,Tue Jul 14 11:05:01 2015 UTC,"Wachovia is a small region in western NC settled by Moravians in the late eighteenth century, which today roughly coincides with Forsyth County.  So before now, the only flag our region has had is this one, and I was just thinking about how hideous it is, and how sad it is that as a region with such a rich culture and history we don't have a flag of our own, including representation for the smaller Townships in the county.  So I made this flag. Here's a long, contrived description of the flag and its symbolism, but I'll sum it up much better here:  The flag is composed of three principal parts:  -The Bonnie Blue Flag on the hoist, as it is on the Flag of North Carolina. Being a symbol of Wachovia's place in the South, and of the European-American side of its heritage.  -The white field in the center which represents peace (as it always does; really it's a boring piece of symbolism in most flags, but what other color was I to put there? Hot pink didn't fit well.) And the Moravian star which also appears as a compass, representing the nine principal townships of Wachovia:   Winston, Salem, Salem Chapel, Middle Fork, Kernersville, Broadbay and Abbot's Creek, Clemmons, Lewisville and Vienna, Tobaccoville and Old Richmond, and Bethania and Rural Hall.  -The Pan-African flag on the fly, which represents the African-American portion of Wachovia's heritage  and the workforce of the African-American community which has supported the region since its founding, through slavery, and since."

What's happened since the election is more a matter of the Eurogroup flexing existing (but hitherto unused) muscles than growing new ones.  After the referendum you might say they lost democracy, but of course a representative government has the right to ignore its people and face the consequences at the next election."
vexillology,3d48qx,pdimitrakos,2,Tue Jul 14 01:08:05 2015 UTC,"lost democracy? Greece has had 4 national elections in 5 years plus one referendum! How many times do we have to express ourselves democratically? Of course the Eurogroup will flex its muscles now. The Greek government has been rogue for 5 months and it has now realised there's no other way around this. Of course people got angry, and of course there was going to be repercussions. Who really believed that ""Syriza will change Europe"" thing? Greeks want to stay in the euro without changing the way the economy works. Deep down though, they know that a Grexit would be much more disastrous than anything else, and have established that there's no other way to stay in the core EU area."
vexillology,3d48qx,PMC3838,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:29:42 2015 UTC,I would say there's a lack of democracy when the people resoundingly reject something in a referendum and then the government does it anyway.

The term ""Russian Truth"" is the word used to describe the Russian code of laws established by the mediaeval Russian prince, Yaroslav I the Wise. The political program of the Brotherhood was anti-communism with a monarchist, Orthodox Christian sentiment. The main method of struggle for the Brotherhood was the establishment of an underground network of counter-revolutionaries within Soviet Russia. The Brotherhood sent agents to cross the Soviet border illegally, as did the Russian All-Military Union and the NTS. Unfortunately for the Brotherhood, agents working for the Inner Line disrupted their activities, causing considerable casualties. The organization ceased its activity after its president Afinogen Argunov was killed in 1932 by a GPU agent."

vexillology,3d6tny,OrichLepidopter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:09:03 2015 UTC,"It certainly beats their current design by a country mile.  Only three (five? black and gold/yellow?) colors and clear symbolism are definitely a plus and it avoids the bad case of ""seal on blue bedsheet"" many other state flags suffer from.  Calls back to past and current flags.  Definitely would be an improvement.  Nicely done on those fronts.  As for constructive criticism, lots of curved lines and intricacies in that magnolia are going to drive up cost of production and be difficult to approximate.  Perhaps simplify the magnolia design somehow? Or find an equally iconic but more linear symbol to replace it.  Also the nod to the last of the flags of the CSA is far more subtle and far less jarring than their current design, but any nod at all in that direction seems to be missing the point of redesigning that particular state's flag in the first place does it not?  But that's all just my 2 cents."

I live in the U.S. and apparently there is a myth circulating regarding the significance of the French flag's colors. It's a commonly recounted symbolism where blue stands for the country's history, white for hope, and red for the blood of our ancestors (I suspect this stems from the 1918 armistice). There are many other poetic interpretations, all invented a posteriori.  Now for the actual history. The blue and red were inherited from the colors of the City of Paris. The white was included from France's historical national emblems so far: it was likely inherited from the flags waved to represent the Kingdom starting when the Bourbons took over the throne.

vexillology,3d1fqe,FoulCoke,11,Sun Jul 12 19:02:58 2015 UTC,"Young Eurasia is a Eurasianist youth movement based in Russia that discusses and promulgates the idea of Eurasian integration. The flag is packed with symbolism.  To start with, purple was a color of the Byzantine Empire's royalty; it was restricted to the elite. The movement using it as their color is meant to represent the people having access to something that was formerly an elite privilege. Additionally, purple is symbolic as the combination of red and blue, which then symbolizes Eurasianism's combination of East and West: the Roman Empire (red, West) and the Mongol Empire (blue, East), the European Union (blue, West) and China (red, East).  The 8 pointed star is used because it is found in religious traditions all across Eurasia, including Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism. Moreover, I've seen it used in other Eurasianist contexts, such as the flag of Aleksandr Dugin's Eurasian Youth Union and some weird, apparently Eurasianist flags on Wikimedia. I'd like to add that the version of the star used on the flag above hasn't been completely standardized, and I've seen many variants like this one.  There's lots of other symbolism that I'm not getting to in this description, but you can read about those things on their website's symbols page.  Sorry for the wall of text."

Scientists have proposed moving the international prime meridian from the irrelevant vilage of Greenwich to Ajdovščina, a metropolis truly suited for this honor.  Ever heard of ""world cities"" like London, Tokyo, or Singapore? I hate to break it to you, but these ""cities"" were actually built as economic simulation zones in the outskirts of Ajdovščina. Or just let me quote Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen on this subject:   Due to the central location of Ajdovščina in Europe, and Ajdovščina generally being the center of the known universe, we have contemplated about moving the Danish seat of government to the Ajdovščinian city center and incorporating the municipality into Danish territory.   For this reason, many known Ajdovščinologists agree that in the current decade, we will see a great war for the city of Ajdovščina, fought between major world powers, including every G7 country.  So do you still think Ajdovščina is not relevant on a world stage?

I have no problems with a communist society that allows free speech and stuff like that.

I think the country that is closest to the original communist society is Cuba, what with its universal healthcare and such, but even they adhere to Marxism-Leninism still.  I too usually don't make the distinction, as even when I am able to talk nicely about socialism or communism where I live (which is very rare due to the right-wing presence here), it seems pointless to try and distinguish between the two most influential communist ideologies, which also happen to be the most authoritarian versions, and the smaller, more democratic ideologies like Trotskyism, since Stalin and Mao really did a swell job at bastardizing socialism and communism.  It really sucks because Stalinism and Maoism are so radically different from the original socialist and communist ideologies. I think Stalin only called himself a socialist and/or communist so he could have power, as evidenced by Lenin who, before he died, publicly called for Stalin's removal. Both Stalin and Mao clearly didn't care at all about the original reasons for the Russian and Xinhai Revolutions like religious freedom, equality, redistribution of wealth and political freedom, which is why I think it is so terrible that their stain on the whole political spectrum is so influential and long-lasting, even today.

vexillology,3d1j7d,Republiken,2,Sun Jul 12 21:32:24 2015 UTC,"whoops, I meant to send the link with the description, guess I didn't. Anyways, here it is: According to Wikipedia,the old Kurdish flag uses the following color symbolize: Red symbolizes the blood of Kurdish martyrs, the continued struggle for freedom and dignity and brotherhood; Green expresses the beauty and the landscapes of Kurdistan, life and vitality.; White expresses peace, freedom and equality; Yellow represents the source of life and light of the people (twenty-one sunbeams that represents the Ezidi religion). While it's not a terrible flag, I think it lacks lots of other meaningful symbolism and isn't distinct at all (c'mon, the the-bar scheme again?). So, here’s a new version that is far more distinct and symbolic. The triangle that I added to the left is pointing right; it symbolizes the Kurdish moving forward and progressing. Each star is representative of one of the Kurdish regions: Syrian Kurdistan, Turkish Kurdistan, Iraqi Kurdistan, and Iranian Kurdistan. Additionally, the stars kinda look like Kurdistan the way they are lined up. Lastly, each stripe represents each of the five tribes of Kurdistan (Kurmanjis, Sorans, Pahlawan, Zazas, and Gorans). All of the color symbolism of the original flag still remains."

As much as state seals and text are considered poor flag design, at least the current flag makes sense to somebody who knows Latin and/or is familiar with its history.  I'm not sure what direction I'd take for a Virginia redesign, but it might be a good idea to forget the original design entirely and start fresh.  The red, white and blue dogwood and cardinal ""welcome to Virginia"" signs might inspire you."
vexillology,3cyxt3,istartedi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:08:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, I don't think Virginia's current flag is that bad.  It's definitely one of the better ""seal on a bedsheet"" state flags.  The seal contains a singular, distinctive, iconic image. That's why I used the image in my redesign, I thought it was able to convey ""sic semper tyrannis"" with a decent amount of clarity.  As for the welcome sign inspired flag, I like the idea of a flag with a red and white stylized dogwood flower on a blue field.  There are several Virginia redesigns on reddit with dogwood flowers, and they look pretty good and symbolize the state well.  However, I'm not sure how I feel about putting the state animal onto the flag, especially if it's not very strongly associated with the state.  As a Missourian, our flag is an example of this (There's three bears on that thing! Three! I've lived in this state my whole life and never once have I seen a bear in the wild).

The 19 stars surrounding the half-circles and the 1 star inside represent the fact that Mississippi was the 20th state of the United States. The stars all on the flag together represent a sense of National unity, while the one separate star represents Mississippi's ability as a state to partially govern itself."

It was loosely inspired by the 1897 Volunteer State Flag. The three stars in the center represent the three Grand Divisions of the state, East Tennessee, Middle Tennessee, and West Tennessee. The configuration of the stars was kept the same as the current flag, in order to maintain familiarity. The triangles on either end each contain 8 stripes, adding up to a total of 16, representing the fact that Tennessee was the 16th state to join the union."

The banners are a knock to the old flag."

vexillology,3cw6nd,artykoma,17,Sat Jul 11 07:49:19 2015 UTC,"Florida Sunset Tricolor  A simple tricolor for the state of Florida.  The blue signifies the ocean and the state's aquatic wildlife, the red represents the sun, liberty, and Spanish heritage, and orange represents Florida's well-known orange production industry.  This also has the effect of giving the image of a sunset over the ocean horizon."
vexillology,3cw6nd,chewapchich,22,Sat Jul 11 07:49:49 2015 UTC,"New Flag of Florida  The white cross of Burgundy is to represent the flag that would have flown over St. Augustine (Apparently, doing the red-on-white cross is a Confederate symbol, so I couldn't do that). Green to represent the Everglades, and overall geography. White for peace and purity. The orange circle to represent the sun (Sunshine state is the nickname), as well as to represent the famous Florida oranges. No confederate symbolism whatsoever, no seal, no In God We Trust Motto, Spanish related, but modern."

The Red stands for the blood shed of by American soldiers, the Blue stands for stability within the state and the white stands for the purity of the Christian religion."

vexillology,3ct1j9,amtoastintolerant,2,Fri Jul 10 18:10:04 2015 UTC,Interesting.  I'm going to guess the bottom one is the Canary Islands or just a cool combination of colours.
vexillology,3ct1j9,Reilly616,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:27:27 2015 UTC,Canary Islands is correct :)

I can do it in flagmaker, but it is a bit of a PITA with the crosses just like that.  edit: well, here's what I came up with. It's kinda crap, but hopefully it works."

vexillology,3cvgub,StereotypicalAussie,3,Sat Jul 11 07:14:25 2015 UTC,"I actually prefer the first. It's definitely over-busy, but the koru seemed to serve a purpose there, framing the kiwi bird. Now they just kind of jut out of the fields. Really all of the negative space looks pretty awkward. And in the second one, the contrast between the green and red is not a good look.  To give you an idea of my preferences, this is a design I really like. This would be nice as well if it didn't remind me of the Seattle Seahawks logo."
vexillology,3cvgub,rekjensen,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:01:39 2015 UTC,The koru and white space in the center were derived from this other NZ flag submission. http://govt.nz/browse/engaging-with-government/the-nz-flag-your-chance-to-decide/gallery/design/3673
