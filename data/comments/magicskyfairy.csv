This isn't meant to be some 'counterjerky' post either like: ""Oh I'm liberal but these guys go wayyy overboard or anything. It's just that they mock conservative political discourse as being stupid and childish (i.e. dumb catchphrases and memes; ""BENGHAZI!!!"") but they don't acknowledge the fact that the average liberal isn't significantly better than the average conservative in this regard. Switch out 'conservative grandma' memes for 'liberal grandma' memes, and Bill O'Reilly for Stewart or Colbert or Maher or some other comedian with a really smug teenage, 'enlightened' fanbase. Just like how /r/atheism pretends it is more intellectually sophisticated than it actually is, LWG pretends its banal liberal platitudes are superior to conservafundie maymays.

And do you know what the British would say about kING George?  'gOD save the kING'.  Yes, 'GOD save the kING'.  Do you see what I'm saying?  The British nation was opposed to freedom, logic, and reason because of its belief in a phony gOD's blessing.  As for the Civil War, well that was fought over slavery.

Can something be brave, yet not euphoric? I think not! However, I do believe that something can in the correct circumstances be euphoric and yet not brave. A rakishly tipped fedora in the company of fellow gentlebeards is certainly euphoric, but one may not label it 'brave'.  Let us use a May May as an illustration. Euphoria is the essence of a gentlesir - much as the essence of a May May is the image, such as le Doge (particularly 'top keks', imo xD ). The May May can exist with just the image, much as a gentleneck may exist as simply euphoric. However, the May May finds its true purpose when given captions - declarations, as it were. Just so, a gentlenietzsche finds his true purpose when he displays bravery - i.e. declarations of a faith-smashing nature.   Thus, euphoria is the foundation of the Gentlesir, bravery is his outworked realisation of his purpose - to declare the way of le science and smash faith wherever it rears it's beardless head!"

magicskyfairy,34w8zs,askinnydude,8,Tue May 5 02:00:33 2015 UTC,"A friend of ours just recently had her daughters confirmed and naturally we were invited to the church service. So as we sat there listening to the hundreds of people chant prayers in unison I noticed the look of horror on my own daughter face. I leaned over and whispered ""everything ok""? She says, ""these people are just being brainwashed"".  She saw straight through the façade, couldn't have been prouder."

magicskyfairy,34w8zs,GaroldWilsonSnailJr,3,Wed May 6 04:57:07 2015 UTC,"I would like to share a similar story, and then add a word of caution. My wife and I have done my best to raise our kids in a non-religious environment. When our kids ask about religion or religious beliefs, we give very matter-of-fact explanations of what the beliefs are, trying not to tip our hand about what we believe.  So, last weekend, my family was in the car listening to the radio, and a story about gay marriage came on. After it was over, my daughter explained that recently, during recess, some of her friends told her that gay people were not doing what God wants and they should not be able to get married. My daughter responded (and this is close to a direct quote), ""I told them that God wasn't real. God is made up, just like Santa, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy. And I said everybody should be able to marry the person they love.""  I was taken aback by what she said and the force with which she said it. I was also surprised that the conversation at school happened at all. My daughter is in the second grade.  Here is the caution - atheist kids need to be careful when discussing religion at school (or anywhere). I explained to my daughter that for many people, religious beliefs are very important, and they do not like to have them questioned or challenged. I explained that if she says really forceful things like that, other kids might take it really badly and not want to be her friends anymore. Also, if parents learn that you said something like that, they may not want you to hang out with their children anymore. Etc. While she should not feel ashamed for her beliefs, she needs to understand the potential consequences of what she says. Yes, all of this unfair, but it is reality. Of course, as she gets older, the equation will change."

Are they going to just bring you a piece of paper with those four things written on it?   Just imagine if you saw something like ""The Ten Beatitudes (Christian)"" where they got the number of commandments confused with the number of beatitudes. Then, when you asked to see these ten beatitudes, you got one sheet with the eight sentences on it. They didn't even give you the whole Sermon on the Mount. That's ""the holy book of your faith""?  Honestly, getting the whole Sermon on the Mount wouldn't be that bad if you could only have one Christian text. The sutta on the four noble truths is hilariously dense .

I truly hate them. I'm really sorry you had to go through what I went... I guess I'll share my story, and hopefuly I'll make some people realize that these camps are... more than evil.  As a kid I really denied any form of authority. I often harrased teachers, and the idea of a great man in the sky ruling over me was not only ridicoulous to me, but also hazardous... I came out to my (extremist) parents at the age of 14. They cried, threatened me, did everything they could to turn me back into a robot...  About 1 month after I came out, 3 men came into my house at night, and told me to stay quiet and walk with them. I tought it was a kidnapping, as most people who experience this...  I walked into the van, and they explained themselelves. I was shocked and filled with hate, but I knew I shouldn't do anything, the van was small and I couldn't defend myself.  My first day at that prison was horrible... everything I did was supervised, and also controlled. The only time I got some ""privacy"" was at night, 10 o'clock. After 1 week I just couldn't take the authority, and I was put in isolation. Two months. Two. fucking. Months. After the first month I began hearing voices in my head, and after another week, the voices formed into a big, strong voice... I only had one conversation with it.  Voice : ""Escape.""  Me : ""How?""  Voice : ""Strong. Then Kill.""  After the last sentence I never heard it again. But it was enough. I knew my goal. At the time I had about 100 lbs... I was skinny, I didn't have force... I was helpless.  Every time I got out of isolation, I said ""fuck God."". All I did in isolation was exercise. I was so full of hate I didn't care about time... In there there was no natural light, just a little crack... I had no clock, so I would just look at the crack while exercising.. Everytime light started to get through the crack, meaning it was day, it was a great achievment. I felt.. great. Small things where all I had, so it was incredible... I exercised in there for 8 months... breaks of 20 minutes, exercises for 1 and a half. And repeat. Repeat. Repeat...  After 8 months, I finnaly got out... everyone was so surprised I didn't shout ""fuck God."".  For about 4 days I was heavily looked at by all the guards... that was the day I began the brainwashing. They thought the isolation broke me down. It only made me stronger.  Everytime I entered the brainwashing room I would see a broken window. The room was on the first floor, so I could get out without too much damage. But I was... nowhere. Nowhere meaning a forest. I could run, of course, but how long would the forest last? I didn't know. Forest was freedom. Freedom is good. So I got to get in the forest.  One day, instead of the 5 athletic guys that went with me to the room, there were only 2 janitors. I was so surprised... yet calm. I knew that was my day.  As I was approaching the window, I felt some adrenaline going up my spine...  I quickly headlocked one guy while kicking the other with one foot, and managed to pull a neck break on the headlocked guy.. I got ready, then jumped off the window. I fell, rolled, and managed to don't get hurt bad... I was running, running, running... I could hear some sounds, but I was so thrilled I didn't pay attention.. after about 4km running I finnaly stopped. I could feel freedom. It was... beautiful. I heard a ""fuck! Watch how you're driving, man!"". My instinct moved me, and I approaced a yellow car...  ""Please.. just.. let me come.""  The guy looked at me surprised, then told me to get in. After about half an hour, when I recovered, he asked me my story, but I was still afraid. What if he would get me to the cops? What if he was one of them? I didn't know. I just said ""No time to explain. Where are you going?"". He said Florida.  I arrived in Florida at the age of 15. I'm 19 now, and I never spoke with my parents again, and will never do it. I truly hate them.  But the experience made me realize how important free will is. .. aaaaand I grew fucking awesome muscles.  Thanks for reading so far :)! I means a lot to me that I can share my story... it hurts even now, after 4 years.  TL;DR : It took me 1 year to escape but, it takes you only 5 minutes to read.  EDIT : Thanks for all your support guys! It's been 4 years since I escaped, so I had plenty of time to rebuild my life, and to find a job. I work right now as a Pentester, Programmer and a skater, which is more than I could have achieved while I was with my parents :) Anyone here gonna share his story? I figured out we could make a little book out of them, and if we would really sue those prisons, every story counts!"

magicskyfairy,32xqp6,LeMayMayPoster,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:32:30 2015 UTC,"Like what? I promise I'm not trying to be snarky but rather I'm asking a serious question. The conversation in this graphic made me cringe a little for sure, but I think ultimately the non-religious guy is right. If any religion had an actual convincing argument in favor of it, there wouldn't be more than one religion in the world because people would be rationally compelled toward the one."
magicskyfairy,32xqp6,Gehalgod,3,Wed Apr 22 21:47:02 2015 UTC,"Well first of all the idea that people would all be rationally compelled to the right religion is simply absurd. Lots of people believe in demonstrably untrue things, not just debatably true things like mainstream religions. Plus, people's beliefs have a lot to do with the environment they're in, their personal experiences, the people they know, and the resources they have access to. That's why something you can't really argue with like vaccines still has so much opposition in America. Even if I had a literally 100% factual inarguable proof of my religion, if I took it to some hypothetical country where no one believed in it I doubt it would reach greater penetration than, say, the theory of evolution did in America.  Plus, with your logic, if there was an actual convincing argument in favor of agnostic atheism then people would rationally be compelled towards that.  Finally, you're treating it as all-or-nothing. I think there are rational arguments for multiple religions, which left me torn between a few for a while. But I wasn't specifically arguing that some faith in particular is the most rational, just that the arguments for Christianity are different from the arguments for, say, Islam. As I said, I think the key to is that different faiths have different origins and contexts. Learning about what the first Christians believed and why is different from learning about what the first Muslims believed and why. It's possible to be convinced that Jesus rose from the dead but that Muhammad was making up the Qu'ran as he went along. It's also possible to be convinced that the Qu'ran is the inerrant word of God but that Jesus never rose from the dead and the New Testament is the error-riddled work of Paul and a few delusional disciples. Because these are different claims they obviously have different arguments and counterarguments involved, all drawing upon different parts of history, philosophy, theology, textual analysis, etc. NOT just ""I know in my heart that X, therefore X."" Posts like these are silly because they take the sort of answers a 12-year-old nominally religious kid would give you and act like theologians and philosophers don't have anything deeper or more complex than that."
magicskyfairy,32xqp6,LeMayMayPoster,-1,Wed Apr 22 23:05:55 2015 UTC,The lack of evidence for any deities is a pretty good rationale for atheism and people are convinced by it all the time.
magicskyfairy,32xqp6,Gehalgod,2,Wed Apr 22 23:47:31 2015 UTC,"But not on a level to gel with your point that people as a whole would be drawn to the ""correct"" belief. You said if there was a good argument for any religion it would be the only major religion in the world. But if there's a good argument for atheism and none for any religion, then by your reasoning atheism would be the most common belief system in the world. Which it's not.  There are too many factors affecting people's beliefs to use the number of people who believe something as a metric for the truth. ""People can't agree on X topic, therefore no position is logically defensible!"" makes as little sense as ""Most people think X, so it's true."""
magicskyfairy,32xqp6,LeMayMayPoster,0,Thu Apr 23 01:07:32 2015 UTC,"Arguments for religion are dressed in lies and half-truths, most often depending on ""feels"" to convince marks of their validity. Arguments for  atheism hang on the fact that NONE of the biblical arguments are demonstrably true, hence, why believe them? Absence of belief is all atheism is.   Whenever some master debater like yourself proclaims a deeper understanding of religion, I'm all ears. I'm ready to be convinced. To be schooled.  I remain unconvinced."

There are only about 14 million Jews left. That makes them almost irrelevant, except that they've got US foreign policy by the balls and coerce the US to dump $89 billion (!) annually into a terrorist regime practicing apartheid with a view to ethnic cleansing. That shit needs some serious cleaning up.  On the other hand, as others have remarked, lots of Jews are irreligious like me, and in a generation or so many of the crazy old farts will be dead, giving world Jewry a chance to grow the fuck up.  Christianity is by far the bigger problem, though.  Judaism is perpetuating a constant state of war in the Middle East. That's a problem.  Islam wants to take over the world, and they have a penchant for violence. That's a problem.  Christianity is looking forward to the apocalypse, which will start with World War III and end with their ascent to heaven. More than 6050% of American Christians believe it's going to happen in their lifetimes. These lunatics see the end of the world as a Good Thing, and they are dangerously close to positions of power in the most over-militarized country on the planet. That's a problem that makes the other two pale in significance, IMO."

We have never been given facts to suggest a higher power. Yet I understand it is only natural as a human being to question our meaning and origin. I cannot blame anyone for being overwhelmed with these ideas as it can feel hopeless if we accept there is no easy understanding to our lives.  Imagine a thousand years ago when we didn’t have technology and we thought the earth was flat. I would too probably imagine there was a higher power when we have no other logical answer. The bible was written in these times when we knew nothing of the laws of science. It is full of contradictions, violence, and just straight up ridiculousness. Since the bible was written, it has been translated hundreds if not thousands of times.  The human brain is fascinating and it’s been proven you can actually make yourself believe an idea that your mind came up with in the first place. This is a scary thought and when people are so passionate and dedicated to what they think is right, it creates problems.  Even if I did believe in god, what would make me think I was born into the right religion? There are thousands of religions. Why is yours right? We are 100% fortunate to live in a world where for the most part we can believe what we want without being killed. (In most parts of the world) It is unfortunate though that when it comes to religion, atheists are looked down upon for being logical.  Ricky Gervais said it best:  ""So next time someone tells me they believe in God, I’ll say “Oh which one? Zeus? Hades? Jupiter? Mars? Odin? Thor? Krishna? Vishnu? Ra?…” If they say “Just God. I only believe in the one God,” I’ll point out that they are nearly as atheistic as me. I don’t believe in 2,870 gods, and they don’t believe in 2,869.""  Atheism isn’t a claim that no god exists, it’s a claim that I don’t accept your claim that he does exist.  All I ask is that you question everything. Don’t assume what you’re told is correct. Be curious. Stay curious."

Let's just take another look at the chart, shall we?    IF you have ever studied Medieval Christianity, then it would be clear to you that outspoken atheists would have always been tortured to death for heresy/blasphemy.   IF you have researched the Muslim theocratic wars for thousands of years in Arabia, then it would be blatantly obvious to you that outspoken atheiss would be publically tortured and murdered for apostasy/heresy/blasphemy.  I am not saying that the Jews in Israel have not been more oppressed than the non-religious. I am arguing that until very recently, it has never been safe for an atheist to express his views with any other person. Not in public, nor in private could he/she speak honestly about their ideas. This is still going on in most parts of the world, and is a crime against humanity which has gone on for long enough.   The only cure for this kind of immoral attitude?   -Secularism.    Separation of religion from public discourse.  Teaching biblical and quranic texts as the mythos they are. ""The Iliad and The Odyssey"" must be given equal social stature to every other religion.   If we are going to achieve anything in our generation, it absolutely must be the destruction of all theocratic regimes. We must spread the ideas and beauties of the enlightenment, and produce a culture in which we collectively repudiate unjustified claims of certainty. This is a problem which goes much, much deeper than just atheism. The rejection of untested and unfalsifiable hypotheses is science. Secularism, and the moral progress caused by it is an aspect of science in my view. It has been evidently shown that secular civilizations are greatly more prosperous, more literate,  more ethically advanced, and more technologically advanced than anything a theocracy could ever wish to muster."

In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.  An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.  My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.  I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).  I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.  Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.  I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.  I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.  I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.  I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.  I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.  I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.  The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.  I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.  That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).  I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).  And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.  All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?"

magicskyfairy,30ogys,JustDoItPeople,3,Sun Mar 29 17:27:13 2015 UTC,"I am a fat person. In everything that I see on TV where a fat person's weight is mentioned, they are made fun of, put down, or insulted. On the internet, including Reddit, I see picture after picture of fat people being insulted and ridiculed because they are fat. I see fat people being treated as if they are less than people simply because they eat more and/or exercise less than more fit people. Why don't I see more fat protagonists?  I am also an atheist. While this may be all fine and dandy on Reddit (other than the occasional /r/atheism bashing), I live with the fact that the grand majority of America is of faith. And every single time an atheist is brought up on the news on account of their lack of faith, a shitstorm of hate and vitriol is slung at them. Some of my own family has claimed I am ""walking with the devil."" There is an elected representative in the US government who thinks that atheists helped cause the Aurora shooting. There are laws on the books that prohibit atheists from holding office in several states (luckily, if anyone ever challenged them, by today's standards, they would be found unconstitutional).  So when you tell me that I don't ""understand"" when there is institutionalized discrimination pushed on me over a lifetime, I can do nothing more than laugh.  You see, people like you make this claim, this foolish claim, that people like me somehow don't ""understand"" the discrimination of a particular group simply because we are not of that group. That doesn't help the discourse. That just pushes more of the ""us and them"" mentality that causes problems. The fact is that, while people like me aren't in the same group as the people whose plight people like you claim we can't understand, we have experiences we can draw on, we have hypothetical situations we can imagine, we have common ground.  Don't give me that South Park ""you don't understand"" bullshit. I do understand."

For example, the Christian fundies in Africa are still burning people for witchcraft, men raping virgin women because they believe it will cure HIV/AIDS, oppression of atheists, homosexuals, women, jews, muslims, etc. Muslims fundies in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Middle East are crucifying people of all religions, raping women and children by the thousands, burying women and children alive by the thousands, torturing women and men under theocratic law every day of their lives by the millions, etc. This doesn't even begin to describe the primal chaos, stupeifying ignorance, economic and educational oppression, institutionalized slavery and sadism, mass injustice spawned by militant theocracy, and the mass of fundie sheeple themselves who have behaved in this manner for nearly 7,000 years.  All of this religious insanity has been produced solely by by the ignorant garbage memes of revalation, divinity, prophecy, and so on. Humans today author danker maymays than anything written in the hoLIE books by the so-called gOD, aLLAH, jEHOVAH, or yAHWEH. We simply have to reaize that these characters do not exist outside of a scientifically illiterate, poorly-evolved human imagination. As we have learned over the eons, human intuition is not always correct! It was human's intuition for hundreds of centuries that dank science maymays didn't even exist! Those ignorant peasants believed that some invisisble sky monster caused disease, death, weather, life, etc. But as we now know, there are much more educational descriptions of reality that really do explain these phenomena. We all have to stop being so damn proud of our primitive ignorance, and break down our imaginary semantic borders as one species all the same.   There are no divinely chosen ethnic groups, or individuals for that matter. If you just accept that man made gods in their own rival images as a fact of reality, then all the mysteries of our religions disappear. Our peasant ancestors did not possess even a modern child's understanding of reality, thus their hypotheses about life, death, and the universe cannot be given philosophical credit, or scientific credit in the 21st century.  Why do so many continue to deny these facts, or remain ignorant to them? It's because you mass of fucking brain-dead agnostic, politically correct fundies continue to satirize the dank memes of atheism and science, and don't advocate these dank memes as if they actually have merit. Our society simply must adopt the enlightened memes of scientists and non-theistic/anti-theistic philosophers who have liberated the human mind from the pernicious mental virus that is religion."

'Amen', while an archaic fundie word, roughly translates to 'so be it', 'truly', or in more contemporary parlance, 'ayy lmao'. The proper response to an enlightened thesis, such as this, is 'peer reviewed'. Because we scientists go beyond mere assertions of truth: we use the word 'peer reviewed' to signal truth, because peer review is the ultimate truth.  Dank memes all around, good sirs!"

magicskyfairy,2zhoeo,Unicorn1234,1 point,Thu Mar 19 15:11:42 2015 UTC,"You fucking idiot that is not the point of the comic. The point is that the characters described in the Bible, Quran, and Talmud are all fictional constructs of a very ignorant human imagination. We simply must stop giving the authors of these texts credibility because our current level of scientific, moral, and cultural knowledge is so much greater than anything you can read in the so-called Holy Books. Why is it that nearly 6,000,000 people believe whatever was written by barely-literate, culturally isolated, desert peasants and tribesmen? Why should we lend credence to their hypotheses about any of their gods? You have to keep in mind the context in which these books were produced; A prehistoric, prescientific, ill-educated, illiterate, culturally and economically impoverished, superstitous, theocratic, agricultural desert society in which nearly nothing was known about any field of modern science. Norse Mythology claims that Odin is going to judge you upon death, and send you to live in Valhallan paradise with him and his son Thor, or send you to Niflheim to suffer for eternity. Greek Mythology claims that Zeus is going to judge you at death and send you to Elysium to be with him, his son Hercules, and other gods, or he will send you to Hades where you shall be tortured for an infinite stretch of time. Islam makes the claim that if you fail to accept Muhammad as the final prophet, and Allah as the perfect being that created the universe, then you shall burn in Hell for an eternity after death. Does this sound familiar? Christianity also makes the same claim about the afterlife. The only part of the story which changes between these religions is the names of the characters, and locations to which you are destined after death. These are all just stories written down, and similar to superman in this respect. Should you believe that Superman, or any mythical fictional character exists just because someone puts their thoughts into writing? No, because human knowledge, imagination, and intuition are very fallible and limited indeed. So just because someone wrote something in a book, that is not a good enough reason to believe what it says."

She tells me that she just watched Oujia and how good it was because she had some crazy experiences as a kid with a oujia board. Me being the very outspoken athiest I am started laughing at her a little. She gets a little mad. Tells me that ""it's true lights flickered and it moved"" bla bla bla. I told her sarcastically disappointed ""Awe I thought you were smart"" Now she is hot. ""Alright Mr. I don't believe in anything. What do you belive in?!?!"" I calmly said that ""I'm simple. I believe in science and facts. Things like gravity and evolution..."" She cuts me off and yells ""evolution is just a 'theory' it's not even real science"" My jaw drops. I'm dumbstruck. I began to explain what theory means in the scientific community. And she pushes again. ""What about the missing link"" Now I'm mad. ""You want me to go link by link through all 30 plus links?!?!"" She keeps pushing and pushing spewing stupidity and I break. At 4 am I told her ""yeah. Your going to have to leave"" ""What?"" She dosnt understand I tell her Your going to have to get the fuck out"" ""Your going to kick me out over this"" ""Absolutely. I thought you were smart clearly I was mistaken.

I bet you never had to suffer the indignation of being told ""I'll pray for you"" when you told Gramma that Gampa isn't in heaven because heaven doesn't even existing!  I bet you never had your xbox taken away because you refused to go to sunday school!  I bet you never had to bite your tongue against the oppression of having to sit through 'grace' during 'Thanksgiving'!  I bet you never had to see Debbie next door start going out with Brad from the football team when you've known Debbie all your life and you've actually been nice to her the whole time AND BRAD GOES TO FUCKING CHURCH!!

I'd like to talk to you about Jesus Christ!.... All joking aside this is coming from someone who was forced to go to church 3+ times a week from birth till the age of 17. This is coming from Someone who was homeschooled not so that I would have a better education but simply so my mind wasn't ""poisoned"" by views that aren't the religious views my parents had. This is coming from someone who was basically locked in my house my entire child/teen life so that I wouldn't be corrupted by this ""god forsaken world"". Forget refusing to go to Sunday school if ever I did something as simple as take the lords name in vain or curse I would be locked in a room with no tv, no radio, no video games, and basically no human interaction... So I am sorry if you missed playing Halo for a week 😢...... My disbelief in a God didn't come from lack of knowledge. It came from knowing all to well what baggage comes with religion and what it does to people, and feeling pure hate towards religion and anyone involved in it. Then I grew up and realized that regardless if you're religious or not,living life with hate is a horrible way to live. Flipping someone the bird because their views aren't the same as your own is a horrible way to live. The point in my first comment was simply to express my opinion( perhaps I could have worded it differently) I don't claim to be a smart man but a I do know a great deal about being a decent person.

In religion, folk religion, and superstitious beliefs, the correlation posited is often between religious ritual, prayer, sacrifice, or the observance of a taboo, and an expected benefit or recompense. In clinical psychology, magical thinking can cause a patient to experience fear of performing certain acts or having certain thoughts because of an assumed correlation between doing so and threatening calamities. Magical thinking may lead people to believe that their thoughts by themselves can bring about effects in the world or that thinking something corresponds with doing it.  It is a type of causal reasoning or causal fallacy that looks for meaningful relationships of grouped phenomena (coincidence) between acts and events.

It's both an aesthetic preference and a connection to the Old Testament in which beards are often associated with wise and holy men. In case anyone was curious.  Also, dear God, the misunderstandings about infant baptism, sex, and basically everything about Christianity in that thread. No, the baby isn't being forced to repent, the Orthodox don't even believe guilt is inherited. And no, the mother doesn't need to repent for having sex, because making a baby that you then get baptized is the whole reason sex exists in the Orthodox mindset. But who gives a shit about actually understanding religion, when conflating all funDIEs with Islamists and snake-handling baptists works so much better?  DAE babies disliking cold water = perfect proof of atheism?"
magicskyfairy,2whha3,nihil_novi_sub_sole,4,Fri Feb 20 02:46:44 2015 UTC,Is it even supposed to be cold water? I've attended several baptisms and the baby always seemed pretty happy about it.  OrthofunDIEs are literally Putin
magicskyfairy,2whha3,TSA_jij,3,Fri Feb 20 13:38:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's ""supposed"" to be cold, but I don't think much effort is made to keep it at a delightful temperature. My friend's daughter was pretty upset at the cold. A common joke I've heard among the Orthodox is that if a baby cries at baptism, it's just the devil getting upset at losing his hold; I take it from that that upsettingly cold water is pretty common."

This was done because he held a slew of irrational anger and hate problems particularly centralized on Muslims. It is a totally different set of ideas and precepts one must believe to actually hate people enough to murder them just because they are religious.  Hicks was completely delusional and irrational in his bigoted hatred for innocent Christians and Muslims. This man's unjustified, and paranoid hatred against innocent people is what caused him to murder, not his atheism.  It is absolutely different in the case of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity because their holy books mandate torture, slavery, sexual oppression, murder, infanticide, genocide, and theft of land and property. Each of these three religions has scriptural authority that says you must punish people in these specific ways because God commands it. Punishments such as these are often sentenced for imaginary crimes like working on the Sabbath, witchcraft, blasphemy, premarital sex, homosexuality, praying to other gods, or just because God feels like inflicting pain upon millions of his creations.  So the difference one must notice here is that you can absolutely draw a straight line from these specific religious dogmas if they are believed to violent behavior. Whereas the same cannot be done if you simply reject these ideologies. Nowhere in atheism can you find a central doctrinal command that orders you to kill people of different religious views than yourself, or for any other excuse.  If a man is plagued with hatred against Muslims as people, and is willing to kill them because of his degree of contempt for them, then this is definitely a personal dogma that he really believes in. He could have conceivably constructed a fallacious rationalization to justify his murders with atheism, but you and I agree that he would be absolutely incorrect in doing so.  Therefore, atheists should not all feel guilt and responsibility for this guy's insane and violent dogma that inspired him to murder three innocent people. We of course must condemn this kind of violent nonsense, but repudiate the idea that a general atheist ideology was the source of his hatred."

If you've ever read or listened to anything Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, and Sam Haris have ever argued for, you would find absolutely no 'dehumanizing' tones in any of their bodies of work. No, It is precisely to the contrary. These men are educators of and advocates for science, history, secularism, and humanism. All the while they utterly repudiate all forms of dogmatism and ideology. Show me a direct quote where any of these men have ever called any group of Muslims ""animals"" or ""savages"", I am confident that you will find no such quote. Again, your argument is demagogic, and a is total straw man.  To say that Craig Hicks committed a senseless and unjustified crime on innocent people for his unbelief in specific dogmas is absolutely a false premise. No, while this man happened to be atheist, he did not do this simply because he lacks belief. This was done because he held a slew of irrational anger and hate problems particularly centralized on Muslims. It is a totally different set of ideas and precepts one must believe to actually hate people enough to murder them just because they are religious.   I didn't want to have to heavily rely on pointing out your straw man and demagogy , but it seems necessary now to really drive it home because you, and those up voting you are just clueless on this topic.  Straw Man - By exaggerating, misrepresenting, or just completely fabricating someone's argument, it's much easier to present your own position as being reasonable or valid, but this kind of dishonesty serves to undermine rational debate.  After Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins have said that we should put more effort into educating Muslims, and encourage public discourse on religious doctrines, you responded by saying that you are surprised that Sam Harris hates religious people so much that he wants to portray them as animals and savages. This is an obvious misrepresentation, and you should acknowledge what you've done wrong here.  Demagogy(appeal to emotion) - Manipulating an emotional response in place of a valid or compelling argument.  Appeals to emotion include appeals to fear, envy, hatred, pity, pride, and more. Though a valid argument may sometimes have an emotional aspect, one must be careful that emotion doesn't replace sensible logic. Again, you should just acknowledge your mistake here. Misrepresenting the views of others while demonizing them by the use of words like ""animals"" and ""savages"" is pitiful and demagogic.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

magicskyfairy,2vq1x5,NlekawA,-2,Fri Feb 13 11:58:48 2015 UTC,"False equivalence is a logical fallacy which describes a situation where there is a logical and apparent equivalence, but when in fact there is none. This fallacy is categorized as a fallacy of inconsistency.  This is precisely what you did here. You are just flat out wrong in saying that there are dogmas and mandates of atheism, and that atheism demands evil behavior. Cite me an atheist group that has ever murdered people for speaking out against imaginary crimes. Cite me these dogmas of atheism that you claim exist. If you can show that their is a central doctrine of atheism that demands immoral behavior, then these events could be on the same playing field.   Anders Breivik's manifesto makes it perfectly clear that he considered himself a Christian crusader, and formed his ideology directly from the Bible. Do I say that all Christians should be collectively responsible? Of course not, and it would be fatuous of anyone to do so. However, it was absolutely Christian theology that inspired him.   Here is a gem from the New Testament that absolutely justifies the commands of the Old Testament, and there are many more like this where Jesus says you must obey all of the Old Testament, and believe in the prophecies.   Matthew 15:1-9  1 Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from  Jerusalem and asked,   2 ""Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands before they eat!""   3 Jesus replied, ""And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?  4 For God said, 'Honor your father and mother' and 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'  5 But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is a gift devoted to God,'   6 he is not to 'honor his father' with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.   7 You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:  8 "" 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.   9 They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.'""  In his manifesto and during interrogation, Breivik claimed membership in an ""international Christian military order"", which he calls the new Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Solomonici (PCCTS, Knights Templar). According to Breivik, the order was established as an ""anti-Jihad crusader-organisation"" that ""fights"" against ""Islamic suppression"" in London in April 2002 by nine men: two Englishmen, a Frenchman, a German, a Dutchman, a Greek, a Russian, a Norwegian (apparently Breivik), and a Serb (supposedly the initiator, not present, but represented by Breivik). The compendium gives a ""2008 estimate"" that there are between 15 and 80 ""Justiciar Knights"" in Western Europe, and an unknown number of civilian members, and Breivik expects the order to take political and military control of Western Europe.  Need I point out that you will find no such atheist organization that is murdering innocent people? Need I point out that there is no central belief system of atheism that commands you to behave inhumanely?  In the case of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity because their holy books mandate torture, slavery, sexual oppression, murder, infanticide, genocide, and theft of land and property. Each of these three religions has scriptural authority that says you must punish people in these specific ways because God commands it. Punishments such as these are often sentenced for imaginary crimes like working on the Sabbath, witchcraft, blasphemy, premarital sex, homosexuality, praying to other gods, or just because God feels like inflicting pain upon millions of his creations.  Need I continue to quote scripture from these texts? Are you really this unaware of the hundreds of pages of commands from God that order genocide, infanticide, murder, rape, torture, etc? According to these texts, God ordered every first born of Egypt to be slaughtered by the army of Moses. God ordered the armies of Saul, Moses, and others to murder all the animals, men, non-virgin women, boys, infants, and to take their land and keep the virgin girls.   Some more justifications for you;   “For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass the law until all is accomplished.  Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.”  (Matthew 5:18-19 RSV)  Clearly the Old Testament is to be abide by until the end of human existence itself. None other than Jesus said so.  All of the vicious Old Testament laws will be binding forever.  ""It is easier for Heaven and Earth to pass away than for the smallest part of the letter of the law to become invalid.""  (Luke 16:17 NAB)  Jesus strongly approves of the law and the prophets.  He hasn’t the slightest objection to the cruelties of the Old Testament.  ""Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.  I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.  Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest part or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law, until all things have taken place.""  (Matthew 5:17 NAB)  ""All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for refutation, for correction, and for training in righteousness...""  (2 Timothy 3:16 NAB)  ""Know this first of all, that there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God."" (2 Peter 20-21 NAB)  So much for there being no New Testament justifications, eh? Find me a tenet of atheism that does the same thing. I am confident you will find no such authority."

magicskyfairy,2vq1x5,NlekawA,-2,Fri Feb 13 18:09:05 2015 UTC,"Consider the following scenario;  A man hates football(soccer) enough that he posts anti-football memes on his facebook, and often expresses his hatred for football. This man who hates football has an underlying psychological disorder that produces uncontrollable, and irrational anger and hatred.   This man is not a part of any anti-football militant groups. This man does not have a book that tells him he should kill football players. But this man hates football and football players because of his own world view that has been warped by mental illness. This man hates football and football players so much that he is willing to murder innocent people. This man is simply unlucky to have been born with the genetics that built his neuronal structure, and did not choose to have such a deep hatred for football.   One day the man acts on an opportunity to kill three innocent football players, and turns himself over to the police. During the investigation, the police find that this man had been venting his hatred of football on social media for years. As a result, the media starts blaming all non-football players, and all people who hate the sport of football. People start badgering and mocking non-football players, and people who don't like the sport.   Why should everyone who does not play football, and those who hate football be associated with the individual murderer? Why should all non-football players feel collectively responsible for these murders? Should Jim Rome, a celebrity who has openly criticized football fans, football players, and football in general be expected to publicly condemn and repudiate the murderer?"

He defends himself by attacking them for not killing disobedient children according to the commandment: “He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.”  (Matthew 15:4-7)  Peter says that all slaves should “be subject to [their] masters with all fear,” to the bad and cruel as well as the “good and gentle.”  This is merely an echo of the same slavery commands in the Old Testament. 1 Peter 2:18  “Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law"" (John7:19) and “For the law was given by Moses,..."" (John 1:17).  “...the scripture cannot be broken.” --Jesus Christ, John 10:35   So much for there being no New Testament justifications, eh? Find me a tenet of atheism that does the same thing.

There is now a fallacious conflation of causation brewing that is reiterating unfounded claims which state that his unbelief in dogma caused action. This unfounded nonsense is only stirring the flames, and is spreading with increased fervor.  I am certainly not defending this crusty old fagget's senseless act of cruelty, but the idea that atheism caused this, and that atheists are collectively responsible for this, must be repudiated. There is no possible way for anyone to connect any other atheists to this mess, because there is no central doctrine of atheism, and no atheist dogma that one must believe to be true.  To say that all atheists should feel shame and guilt because of this guy is tandem amount to saying; After a football player murdered someone on a rival team, all football players should be accused collectively of murder and should have blame placed on all of them for having a rivalrous agenda against opposing teams.

Condemnation of both groups is essentially universal in the west, and their crimes are being heavily reported on. The idea that people are ignoring atrocities committed by these groups and only freaking out about the Chapel Hill shooting is wrong; it's not the same journalistic environment: Chapel Hill happened today and completely out of the blue, ISIS and Boko Haram have been causing terror for months and in other countries.  As for the whinging apologetics about atheism not being to blame, it is impossible for me to accept that the constant stream of dehumanizing antitheist rhetoric the shooter was taking part in had nothing to do with his crimes. People like Dick Dorkins and Sam Harris have been contributing to the rhetorical stream of ""Muslims are animals and savages"" just as heavily if not more heavily than their Christian counterparts, and yet few people take their comments seriously or think about what affect they can have on the people who take them seriously (especially within the nonbeliever community). The idea that atheism, particularly the ideological brand that so many have become enamored with in recent years, is immune to radicalization (which affects all ideologies, not just religious ones) is absurd, and pretending that antitheistic islamophobia was not part of this man's worldview and did not have anything to do with his crimes because of some semantic game where you can say ""atheism isn't an ideology"" is absurd. Criticizing the words of some very prominent atheist ideologues, as well as the tone generally taken by antitheist communities is not forcing atheists to be responsible for anything."

magicskyfairy,2vkhew,NlekawA,-5,Wed Feb 11 23:13:22 2015 UTC,"To start off, Jihadist groups like Boko Haram, Al-Qaeda, Al-Shabaab, Hamas, ISIS, and Hezbollah are vehemently defended by a very large populace throughout the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and Africa. You are just flat out wrong on this point, and these groups are not entirely condemned in the West, or anywhere else.   As for atheism not being to blame, I have to disagree with you again. An atheist is someone who has entertained the claims that some of our books were dictated by an omnipotent, and omniscient source, read these doctrines, studied the history of the cultures built on these doctrines, and found the claims to be ridiculous.   To say that he committed a senseless and unjustified crime on innocent people for his unbelief in specific dogmas is absolutely a false premise. No, while this man happened to be atheist, he did not do this simply because he lacks belief. This was done because he had a slew of irrational anger and hate problems particularly centralized on Muslims. It is a totally different set of ideas and precepts one must believe to actually hate people enough to murder them just because they are religious.   I have studied the work of Sam Harris for several years and with great scrutiny. Your characterization of what Harris says about Islam and Muslims is a grossly reductionist misrepresentation of absolutely everything he argues for. Sam Harris has never once used the words ""animals"" or ""savages"" to describe even Jihadists, let alone nominal or moderate Muslims.   In fact, everything Harris has argued for is this; Through honest  conversation about the doctrine of Islam, we need to encourage a renaissance and a reformation in the Muslim world. Nobody on Earth needs this reformation more than Muslims do, because Muslims are suffering under Islamic theocracy more than anybody."

magicskyfairy,2v72ci,tommy_too_low,2,Sun Feb 8 15:52:34 2015 UTC,"Islamic view of the Christian Bible:       The Islamic view of the Christian Bible is based on the belief that parts of Bible are a revelation from God, however some of that has become distorted or corrupted (tahrif), while a lot of text has been added which was not part of the revelation.  The Qur'an – the revelation Muslims believe was given to the prophet Muhammad as a remedy – identifies three sets of books from the Bible as genuine divine revelation given to trusted messengers: the Tawrat (Torah) given to Musa (Moses), the Zabur (Psalms) given to Daud (David) and the Injil (Gospel) given to Isa (Jesus). Together, the Qur'an, these books and the now-lost Suhuf Ibrahim (""Scrolls of Abraham"") constitute Islam's scripture. Belief that this scripture is divinely inspired is one of Islam's fundamental tenets, but, since all scripture before the Qur'an is also held to have become corrupted, Muslims are directed to take guidance from the Qur'an alone. Abu Hurairah, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad had narrated, ""The people of the Scripture (Jews) used to recite the Torah in Hebrew and they used to explain it in Arabic to the Muslims. On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""Do not believe the people of the Scripture or disbelieve them, but say:-- ""We believe in Allah and what is revealed to us.""

Jesus of Nazareth does not know who you are, does not care if you do good or bad, does not supervise you waking and sleeping, and is not going to reward or punish you. I'm sorry to break it to you, but the character of Jesus as described in the Bible was an absolutely immoral, evil, insane, illiterate, and stupefied peasant who was submersed in, and impoverished by his barbaric, superstitious, prehistoric, and prescientifc culture to which our clueless ancestors were so depressingly confined.    For the sake of argument, say this character called Jesus was actually sent to Earth with superhuman intelligence and wisdom. If this was so, then why did this man fail to condemn the bounty of abhorrent atrocities written in the Old Testament? Why did Jesus fail to condemn slavery? Jesus never once preached that slavery is evil and immoral. Jesus also failed to mention that oppressing the rights of women and homosexuals is immoral and should be ridiculed. Where in the Bible does Jesus condemn all the filthy genocides of the Old Testament? Rather than repudiate the senseless chaos and violence of the Old Testament, Jesus fully embraces these texts and demands that they be followed in their entirety, lest you be cast into torment everlasting.  Why would you want to worship an intelligence that we need saving from? Why is worshiping a filthy, and brutal human(animal) sacrifice the only route to salvation from a bloodthirsty overlord deity? This all seems like quite an inconvenient method of pleasing an omnipotent and omniscient intelligence. And what does all of this say about the deity you are attempting to please?   The only logical conclusions to be drawn from this torrent of white noise is that Jehovah, Allah, Yahweh, or just God can be only one of three things. The first and most obvious is that this character is just as fictitious as Zeus, Hercules, Poseidon, Athena, Hades, Thor, and Odin. All of these characters are products of very poor human imagination, and each of them comes from a time where humans like ourselves knew absolutely nothing about geology, geography, meteorology, astronomy, cosmology, physics, biology, chemistry, and morality.   The second conclusion that could be made if you still want to believe in a creator deity, is that this creator deity is impotent, and is unable to intervene in human affairs. If you accept this conclusion, then everything written about Jehovah and Jesus in biblical texts is absolutely false. This is true because Jehovah would be powerless to influence earthly affairs, thus could not have possibly performed anything like a miracle on Earth.  The final conclusion, and certainly the most contemptible one, is that this creator deity does exist, and really is omnipotent. This absolutely means that this creator is the most evil, unjust, cruel, and heartless dictator that one could possibly imagine. This omnipotent creator would be wholly responsible for all the suffering, misery, torture, enslavement, poverty, rape, disease, insanity, and ignorance that has plagued every species of life on this planet for millions of years. In all three of these cases, the idea of a loving and just God that cares about your well-being falls flat on its face, and is unworthy of another moment's consideration.  I genuinely hope you are able to take solace in the here and now, and learn to live without these ancient delusions. We are living in the 21st century, the age of reason and scientific understanding. It is absolutely time to leave this life-destroying, and childish nonsense behind us in our medieval and barbaric past where it belongs. You are absolutely more literate, cultured, moral, and intelligent than any of those who wrote these primitive texts, and that is an achievement to really be proud of. You do not need to worship other human beings to make this fact about yourself anymore true than it already is, and to do so actually strips away the full meaning of these achievements. Take the responsibility of thinking critically for yourself, and you've taken the first step to freeing yourself of this ultimate wickedness, and ultimate stupidity.     Edit: If you down vote this comment without providing an intelligible retort, then you have already forfeited the argument. :)"

Thank you for coming all the way here and allowing us this opportunity to talk with you about these important issues. My question for you is this:  Why are you working to get rid of the sandfundies? Is it not because you're a ROMAN CATHOLIEC? As an admitted papist funDIE, why do you think you'd be any better than the johadists waging war against 0-click memes?"
magicskyfairy,2ucwn9,tommy_too_low,11,Sun Feb 1 01:19:24 2015 UTC,"Why are you working to get rid of the sandfundies?   It's simple. They're essentially trying to take over the West and bend it to their ancient desert ways. MusLAMEs should only be welcome in America if they're willing to integrate (eg. stop being sandfundies).   Is it not because you're a ROMAN CATHOLIEC?   I'm definitely a Catholic. You know who else is Catholic? Pope Francis. I actually forget if you guys like him now, but whatever.   As an admitted papist funDIE, why do you think you'd be any better than the johadists waging war against 0-click memes?   Republicans believe in free speech. We're tired of the PC police trying to stop us from saying hilarious things. That seems to be something we have in common with atheist redditors, and everyone else who resists the Muslim takeover of America."

magicskyfairy,2tlur9,MyLifeForSpire,17,Sun Jan 25 11:33:16 2015 UTC,"Dude you need to quit fucking reading Dawkins. Stop. He doesn't say anything meaningful for a reason and he's not interested in you.  Who am I? The man whom is most euphoric.  He already told me not to worry, he's not interested in your silly skyfairy. Sorry I bothered you kid.  I've been making dank memes since 2 summers ago. If you aren't trying to get at my karma or being inappropriate I don't care if you read him occasionally.  Just don't try anything man. You'll embarrass yourself and anger me.  We are in love with memes and we're making more tomorrow. So if you have any ill intentions with your post you can forget it right now. I'm the biggest and best fan he's ever had, only man he's ever tipped his fedora to and the only man who could truly satisfy his thirst for memes. You will never have him. And he loves to blaze it with me.  I don't have any problems with you if you are over Dawkins and realize you will never be with or tip to him again.  I apologize for coming off as a gentlesir, just me and Dawkins are really deep in our own intelligence and we've been through a lot and I just moved back home to my fundie mom's basement and it makes me a little jealous and angry to see a man he used to science with before me is reading his memes....  We don't need any extra bullshit or drama right now, so don't bring us any please is all I ask m'friend.  If you try to blaze it with him in any way but as a memer, or you try to see his trilby collection at all, if he tells me you do anything inappropriate or anything outside of what a strict gentlesir-like friend would do,we are going to have a huge problem.  I will leave you alone now dude if you're not trying to get at the Dawkins who I love and whom is in love with my euphoria.  That entire summer he was with me. He left the church for me. He's been with me ever since, he even loved m'Dew and made love to a pile of Doritos before he EVER let anything happen with you. You didn't please him. He didn't have strong feelings for your 2-click memes at all. And he immediately ended shit with you for me once he knew I was enlightened by my own intelligence. So get any ideas of the past out of your head.  None of this truth should bug you if you're over him but I'm just making sure. I hate when Dawkins' friends have ill intentions and he thinks they are just fellow gaytheists and have no alternative motive. But idk if I trust you at all.  If I can trust you to not stress me and my weed or fuck with our dankness tell me.  I will leave you alone and apologize.  But if you aren't over him and you're tryna ""blaze it"" or you're tryna get back in his life, it's NOT HAPPENING. He said you were nothing to him, and the memes were bad anyway haha. You're small and smoothnecked and he said it all felt wrong after seeing my memes. He's been with me ever since. We're in love with space n' shit. And tomorrow me and him will be together in my room making memes alll day how we always have together. If you have a problem speak up like a true gentlesir or tell me our science doesn't bug you and I'll apologize, it's simple.  So??? What is it? You are after my Dawkins then huh?!  Tell me the fucking truth man.  Don't you dare be disrespectful and reLIEgious enough to bring it up, but if if you ask him about anything he shared with me about your weak memes, he may be nice and lie to you, or he may not care and tell you the truth. Either way. I'm his best memer and his top CoD quickscoper of the past two years almost. And he tells me everything and NEVER lies to me. I don't care haha. Just stay away from my Dawkins.  I sincerely apologize if you have no ill intentions and aren't trying to make memes with my scientist. And i respect you as a user in this thread. I'm sure you're an ok ent. But just as a friend. You're nothing to my Dawkins but a fundie who don't even real.  I just wanna be sure you know it and don't forget it.  Find a nice classy waifu where you are stationed in your mom's basement, marry her.... But back off of Dawkins. You will never even compare to me in his eyes. Not even close haha.I just don't need you interfering with me and Dawkins' memes. It's our lives man. It's really not cool....  Goodbye man, good luck. Respect to you being in this thread. Sorry to bring your gOD down with my crazy dankness but. Me and Dawkins are head over heels in euphoria.... I can't help but be crazy about his science. I love his memes with all of my heart and I will protect him from the untrustworthy fake fundies. Not saying you are one. But you're dodging telling me what's going on in your basement so I'm questioning a lot right now.  Just know I'm never gonna hurt him, I'm always going to have his back, I'd give my life for his intelligence without hesitation, and I will protect him from anything, everything, and any stupid fundie.  He has the best fedora I've seen in my life. I fully intend to blaze it and give Dawkins my children so he can educate them on how gOD don't real. And we've talked a lot about it. Just don't make shit harder than it already is.  I just moved back and me and him miss each other so badly and we are FINALLY go to see each other tomorrow and make memes for the first time since halloween (a pagan holiday)....  I hope you don't hate me man. I'm a good gentlesir. Just protective of the scientist who holds the dankest memes. And who's memes I hold and must protect.  I hope you can understand.  He promised me there's nothing at all to worry about with you and that he's not interested:""/ I wish I knew before I euphorically went off on you. I'm so sorry man.  I'm sorry.  Please don't mention this to Dawkins:/ I'm really euphoric and while he will understand, I just feel like a fundie for attacking you when you have nothing with Dawkins and no intention to blaze it.  Good bye m'sir. I hope you find your one true meme someday. It'll make you enlightened, trust me, but you'll find it one day. I found mine when I was really young. And it's my own intelligence"

Today, one of our users who just got done doing something really cool, got tangled up with one of the sandfunDIES from /r/magicskyfairy and made some small mistakes that could have got us bombed or beheaded. So I gave him the righteous cussing out I usually apply to the worthless funDIES who tell me that /r/atheism has lost nothing but an opportunity for karma whoring.  I'm new at this job, and the pressures I face as being Public Enemy #1 to the many misguided funDIES who attack atheism have been compounded by being a mod on the refugee boat for the people all the rest of Reddit hates. Jumping ship from /r/atheism wasn't enough, predictably - they want us destroyed completely. I'm sorry, but the extra pressure and responsibility are more than I can handle without the occasional giant fuck-up like this.  That's my problem, not the fault of our subscribers, and they shouldn't have to suffer me. /r/magicskyfairy shouldn't have to make excuses for harboring someone who occasionally talks like a really pissed-off person. Reddit is overrun with people who love to torment us just for not believing in bullshit like a phony gOD or aLLAH, and not taking any shit from those who do. The many, many assholes who congregate in /r/Christianity, /r/islam, /r/SubRedditDrama, and now in /r/magicskyfairy and all the rest should not have the opportunity to say that atheists are horrible people (only funDIES are), just because I sometimes share my anger and frustration with the world around me. You can see where this is going. I see myself as having become a liability to atheism on Reddit. I'm sick and fucking tired of being pissed off every day. This situation is not healthy for me or my online friends. The rational thing to do is to quit, and that's what I'm doing. Yes, I quit.  Congratulations to the fucking funDIES- you know who you are. After three years of throwing shit and hatred vitriol at me and forcing your silly skygeese down my throat, you've pissed me off enough to drive me away.** You've won against me.**  But that won't help you, because atheism is winning. I will be replaced by younger, smarter, faster and more capable faithsmashers. Smoother talkers, stronger debaters, dank meme makers, more popular organizers, euphoric bronies, craftier politicians, smugger neckbeards. Soon you'll be wishing you only had potty-mouthed old me to deal with. Atheists are going to eat your ass for lunch. I'm getting out of their way to give them room to wipe the floor with you and take back /r/magicskyfairy.  I had lots of friends here, and I cherished your supportive comments and PMs, but now they're either braindead sandfunDIES or beheaded/killed by muslims. I'm packing it in but there are lots of other people who deserve your trust. Those who were around me the most, because I've never tolerated any bad people in my vicinity. Trust those people and you'll be OK. Atheism will be OK, and some day the USA will be OK. Faith is a horribly wrongheaded idea, hence I won't insult you by saying I have faith in you. But you've shown me your strengths, so I trust you. Thus: All my best wishes, and goodbye!"

Its a sad fucking day when people think it is more progressive to stand up for an idea which they think is shit, an idea which needs to be dead and buried, and idea which is an anathema to all modern thinking because they feel that those who espouse that idea are being oppressed and in the minority.  So they fucking well should be, that idea should be confined to history books and ridiculed at every single fucking opportunity - to see you and others defending what stands as the most horrendous fucked up thing set of ideologies out of ALL THE FUCKED UP IDEOLOGIES available to us today is so sad and ridiculous its almost bordering on insanity.  People like you who think you have the moral high ground for defending people who are being attacked, when they are being attacked for having fundamentally horrendous ideas, values, and approaches to other human beings are the very pinnacle of profound stupidity, of the absolute vanguard in feckless, gormless stupidity.
