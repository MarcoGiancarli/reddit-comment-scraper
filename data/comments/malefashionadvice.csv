malefashionadvice,3e2rm2,Cheech5,9,Tue Jul 21 15:01:03 2015 UTC,"Same here. I really wish more shoe companies would offer wide sizes. Even with New Balance it's frustrating to see how a lot of their shoes with cool silhouettes like 996, 1500, 696, etc. don't have wide options."
malefashionadvice,3e2rm2,FutureFox,2,Tue Jul 21 16:39:12 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. I just double checked and it's not even an option with the custom program through the new balance site. Kind of a bummer. I routinely wear a 13 in sneakers for the width, but if I could get a 12 EEE or 12.5EE I'd be set."

malefashionadvice,3e2rm2,lt_hindu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:15 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat as well dude. I find the worst part is actually the steep arch digs into the top of my foot when I first buy the shoes and it makes them ultra painful to wear
malefashionadvice,3e2rm2,Anayalator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:50 2015 UTC,I thought a majority of their shoes were pretty narrow though? I've  wanted to get a pair for a while but my feet are just too damn fat for the cool looking ones!
malefashionadvice,3e2rm2,Cheech5,7,Tue Jul 21 16:07:49 2015 UTC,"Nooo they run wide, for sure. I've got three pairs right now, two 574's and a pair of 501's and they all fit great. I'd say the 574's are a touch narrower than the 501, but that could also be materials (Leather 574's vs nylon 501's).  Either way, I'm a 11.5EEE in Allen Edmonds and they still fit me comfortably without sizing too far up."

You could do what I did, subscribe to /r/sneakers and just browse for a while. I ended up discovering that I loved Saucony Jazz Low Pro Vegans, Adidas SL Loops and some Asics Gel Lytes and they all fit well enough. I'd encourage you to head to your local outlet mall or keep an eye on /r/frugalmalefashion for deals and sales. You should be able to source the NB's at an outlet for a good price, though."

My kingdom goes to the first person who can find a photograph of a gentleman from the 1950's wearing a shoe that looks anything like these.  I like New Balances (am wearing a pair as I type this) but simply saying your shoes are inspired by 50s/60s footwear doesn't make them old school.    Actual 50s athletic footwear

This has always put me off about new balance shoes. They all come off to me like something a 5th grader would wear to gym class or that Grandpa would wear because it's been recommended by his podiatrist. Something about that 'N' logo.
malefashionadvice,3e2rm2,paperboatsintherain,29,Tue Jul 21 17:39:04 2015 UTC,"Hate to sound like a dick but every time NB shoes are brought up in this sub the big N brand is the first major complaint followed by the grandpa shoes comment so no you're not the only one. I just really hate ""am I the only one"" posts.  That being said I don't disagree, the N can really break the deal for some but as someone who used to hate looking at NBs I've opened up to them depending on the model of course. I think their 996s are pretty sick to the point I'm kinda alright looking past the N. Honestly can't remember the models of some but I recently looked at a NB catalog where the N blended in with the design so it was kinda invisible. It was part of their designer collection though so its price was kinda up there"

malefashionadvice,3e2rm2,chiv,8,Tue Jul 21 18:15:59 2015 UTC,"I think that N is what makes them different, at least to some extent. It's nice to have a shoe that's not marked by the traditional word logo, or the ubiquitous check sign(Nike)/3 stripes(Adidas). I find it somewhat refreshing if I see someone with New Balance kicks, especially if it's a 5th grader heading to gym class or a Grandpa rocking them only because his podiatrists recommended them; it makes me feel more than anything like they're concerned with comfort as opposed to the actual brand or logo, or even looking cool. And that, paradoxically, makes them even cooler.... To me anyway.  With that said, the lettering on the tongue in this particular model I could do without."
malefashionadvice,3e2rm2,kakaviaincopper,3,Tue Jul 21 18:08:02 2015 UTC,Exactly. We seem to be split between either Nike Flyknits (which I love) or NB (which is dislike)

malefashionadvice,3e2rm2,kneedeep3,7,Tue Jul 21 14:48:53 2015 UTC,"This is always interesting to me because people seem split at the most basic levels between thinking NB's are super cool and those who think they are ridiculous. It also seems determined by context, where I was hanging out in Copenhagen one summer ago and every (beautiful) stranger was wearing these and looked amazing. Meanwhile, in the USA these shoes might be the standard issue among IT dorks and office workers alike. Alternately, people like Ervell will commonly place them in fits, and it's something different. As per usual, it's probably all relative, but I will say NB themselves appear almost completely impervious to their presence in within the greater fashion milieu."

malefashionadvice,3e1u7y,babyccino,14,Tue Jul 21 14:55:36 2015 UTC,They are not.
malefashionadvice,3e1u7y,ThaiToast,2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:55 2015 UTC,"Nope, the difference is in the lacing system. The derby has 2 quarters that are sewn together, creating clean lines. The blucher meanwhile is continuous with small pieces of leather for lacing"
malefashionadvice,3e1u7y,Velimas,2,Tue Jul 21 15:04:22 2015 UTC,"No I don't think they are.   In the first link, derbies have quarters usually shaped in a half semi circle from the forefoot down to the mid arch. The derby is usually three cuts of leather: one vamp and two quarters. Open lacing and a curved quarter separate from the vamp.   A blucher, the second picture you linked, has a different pattern where the sides are part of the vamp piece of leather. The quarters are very small and basically only have eyelets on them. These have three main cuts of leather as well, except the vamp is the majority of the shoe and the quarters are very small and are sewn with a non exposed seam to the main piece.   This has been my understanding for a long time, despite what most companies or people say."
malefashionadvice,3e1u7y,Micrafone_AssAssin,2,Tue Jul 21 15:04:54 2015 UTC,Ah ok my mistake. I swear I've seen that bluchers and derbies are the same thing just the US and UK's respective words for open vamped shoes.

The only place it makes a difference is obscure arguments on the internet.  Plus, in my experience, people who make the distinction between a derby and a blucher usually still don't know the difference between a balmoral and an oxford, showing how inane the whole exercise is."

You can easily wear them with jeans or shorts and it's technically a faux pas to wear them with a suit (but plenty of people do it, no one would call out anyone else on it, and if you only owned those three pairs he mentioned, they would be the shoes for formal occasions)."
malefashionadvice,3e1u7y,badger0511,4,Tue Jul 21 14:26:00 2015 UTC,Is it a faux pas if nobody would notice it?

A substantial amount of guys on StyleForum are adamant that you should not wear open-laced shoes with suits. It seems like more of them are European rather than American. Lots of random shoe guides from US-based websites like Dappered, Real Men Real Style, and Art of Manliness all basically say that balmorals/oxfords are best for suits, but bluchers are acceptable."

Personally, a derby isn't much different to me than a sneaker in terms of what I'd wear it with (with the exclusion that I wouldn't wear a derby to the gym).  Sure, you can wear sneakers with suits but in that case I think it's pretty obvious you're doing it on purpose.  With a derby it probably looks more like you didn't actually have a pair of dress shoes."

But I'd wager a guess that most guys only wear a suit for the following activities: job interviews, weddings, and funerals. Context plays into job interviews and weddings a bit, but on the whole, you go for the conservative side of things at those events.  I don't know if I've made it clear enough, but I only subscribe to the ""rule"" because I can, and I'll break it if I feel like it. I couldn't care less if someone were to show up at my wedding or a job interview that I'm on the panel of wearing these.  And maybe faux pas was too strong of a term to use. I'd say it's in the same realm of wearing an OCBD with a suit and tie, wearing a pinstripe suit to a social event, or wearing a belt with a three-piece suit. Stuff that people like me and other fashion dorks know you shouldn't do, but the average guy wouldn't know about it."

Boots like those being recommended here are not a necessity, unless you count chukka boots like the CDBs. A pair of CDBs tend to be enough for casual to semi-formal at most, depending on the colour you choose. The darker it is the easier it would be to pull off in semi-formal outfits IMO. I have boots and wearing them with pants (unless you get some techwear like Outlier) in this weather is a pain in the ass, unless you wear them indoors all day. Otherwise those recommended will do fine, although they're probably not gonna be cheap in Singapore.....  Sneakers are a must. One running shoes like New Balance 574s or Nike Flyknits and one canvas or leather sneaker, like Converse Chuck Taylors/Jack Purcells and Adidas Stan Smiths. Maybe even brands like Superga and Toms? Shoes with mesh uppers are a great addition because weather, and so does the thin canvas uppers. If you're brave try suede or nubuck, but knowing the rain we get.....  Boat shoes you can find in a lot of places. If you want affordable just go to Bata. I have no idea of you can find Sperry over there, but we don't have them here. Aldo is relatively affordable too, if I'm right.   Also I don't see anyone mentioning this, but sandals or slippers. Living in a tropical climate you need at least a pair of those. You can find these for cheap anywhere, I imagine, but maybe think about something like Birkinstocks or Camel Active (they also have some nice leather shoes and boat shoes). If that is too steep for sandals, Bata will do.   You can probably dig online for most of these, but I'm sure Singapore has more options than KL when it comes to shopping."
malefashionadvice,3e1u7y,Zassolluto711,54,Tue Jul 21 14:57:44 2015 UTC,What is your budget?  I'd get the following:   A pair of boat shoes - Sperry Topsider in Sahara ($80?) A pair of running shoes - Nike Flyknit Lunar 3 in black ($150) A pair of decent boots - Chippewa Apache in Chocolate or Thorogood American Heritage Moc-Toe in Tobacco ($150-$170 depending on style you prefer) A pair of casual sneakers - lots of choices.

I am probably going to get the Chippewa Apaches for this upcoming fall, and wear them around with jeans everywhere, but in the meantime, what's a good high mileage shoe for summer wear with shorts?

The Nike shoes would be great for something closer to a techwear style. They're probably the most comfortable shoes I own. I also really like a pair of Roshe Run NMs that I have.   Leather shoes are pretty comfortable once they break in. For my summer job, I've been walking around 6 miles a day and I haven't had any problems with CDBs. They took a week or two to break in though. I have a two year old pair of sperries that are extremely well broken in and very comfortable, but I wouldn't really want to walk a lot in them."

malefashionadvice,3e1u7y,CydeWeys,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:18 2015 UTC,I definitely would advise against wearing CDBs with shorts.

It was also nice because I got to go through all the boxes and color match the shoes to my belt."

A pair of Allen Edmonds seconds @ $225 (currently less $50 with the American Express offer) can serve one well for a lifetime if worn sporadically.    However, I understand this is not practical for those who don't have $200 lying around to cover dress shoe needs for the next 10-20+ years."
malefashionadvice,3e1u7y,sandy_lyles_bagpipes,10,Tue Jul 21 13:50:01 2015 UTC,I'd say that only applies if you have $200 lying around and want to blow it on clothing that you don't already have or need. $200 for just a few days really is just unnecessary. I know MFA always preaches being the top dressed dog but for 2 or 3 times a year it's okay to break out some cheaper shoes from the generic department store.

Work boots are just so versatile - good for any weather and the vast majority of my outfits (I don't dress up often) - it's a trade off I'm willing to make. Also, my Chippewas aren't steel toed so that makes them lighter than true work boots."

The first time I was still smoking cigarettes and I'll admit it was pretty rough, but I was in decent shape and got through it alright. This year I had been off of cigs for several months and am in incredible shape. It was a breeze, honestly. My two buddies I was with were wearing their vibram toe shoes and for long hikes couldn't keep up with me. I hiked something like 30 miles (a good portion of it was flat-ish ground, but there was plenty of very rough up and down to get through) and had no problem with it.   So imo, as long as you're comfortable in them and you're in reasonable shape, they're more than fine. That said, there are many better options that are more comfortable and less taxing on you."

A long with these come the Adidas pure boost. Boost is incredibly comfortable and although they retail $120 they can be found incredibly cheap, usually $50-$80.  Some other good options are the Air Max 90 and Air Max 1. Both retail around $110 but if you can find a Nike outlet or find them on sale they range anywhere from $50-$90.  Adidas tubulars are also a great choice at this price range and you should check those out.  At around 110-150 you are in the price range where you can get some nice shoes off eBay that might be a little out of reach brand new. These might be shoes a lot of people on here hate, but Kobes Lebrons and KDs are all viable, comfortable, options. Along with these if you want something brand new Nike Flyknit Lunars usually float around 110 depending on the model  150-200 basically will get you a lot on eBay but also pretty much any shoe you desire at a footlocker or a champs. It could be the Adidas Ultraboosts, or it could be the newest Jordan, LeBron, Kd, or Kobe. Keep in mind Jordan's and certain other models can be hard to get as they might sell out fast.  200+ can get you a multitude of nice and crazy shoes. If we are closer to 200-300 you can buy a lot of shoes that might have sold out for resale online such as Jordan's or Older Models of Lebrons. Also in this range are a lot of cool shoes from the Y3 line such as the adidas Yohjiboosts and many more I can't think of right now.

They're quite good for me. I'm planning to cop Adidas Tubular or a Roshe One. I personally don't like the Nike Air Max that much but I'll still recommend it. They're comfortable but I can't stand the way they look on my feet. I recommend the Air Max Zero or Air Max 1 essential.

malefashionadvice,3e1u7y,Goobera,4,Tue Jul 21 12:21:56 2015 UTC,"To someone starting off, polos, shirts and chinos are an upgrade from the very basic and 'uninteresting' t shirt and jeans. Whenever you see someone talking about where they started off, it's that combination. It might not be a big step but it's part of starting to pay attention to what you wear and getting into dressing well. You may decide to go back to jeans (I did) but that's a conscious decision, rather than one made out of a lack of interest.   For some people (beginners especially) fashion is about standing out, and wearing something that is not too dangerous but still 'out of the norm' (depending on your location of course) is a good first step. Polos, shirts and chinos may not be better based on facts, but his personal perspective is that they are, and that's really all that matters."
malefashionadvice,3e1u7y,Velimas,2,Tue Jul 21 13:59:21 2015 UTC,"Polos, shirts and chinos are just as basic as t shirts and jeans. A t shirt, in fact, has a lot more to work with in terms of interesting aspects than a polo. A Polo requires you to have a well built body otherwise a tee will, more often than not, look better. A polo can only generally vary (slightly) in cutting, collars and buttons. The outfit you suggest limits this variation to only collars and buttons. A t-shirt can vary largely in length, design, cutting because you can play with the proportions of the pants as well. Why are polos more intersting than t-shirts? This leaves only shirts.  Sports shirts are definitely more interesting than a t shirt, you have GBV, BBBF, Kamakura, but what you recommend is the MFA uniform of solid coloured OCBD/chinos. The MFA uniform restricts any variation to... button types, collar widths, collar types and yokes. None of which someone who is asking for advice will have specific requests for. How is this more interesting than a t shirt?  Polos, shirts and chinos are just simply a different outfit, not an upgrade in any way. His opinion is not all that matters, that's nonsense, he is an uninformed person asking for advice, why would you place stock in his uninformed opinion? Shouldn't you address why he is looking into such things instead?  Plenty of people mistake dressing well as dressing up and that's the problem here. Polos/shirts and chinos practically address the same formality setting as t-shirts and jeans in the case of OP.  Polos, shirts and chinos in the form of a MFA uniform is just as basic, uninteresting as a t-shirt and jeans. It's called a uniform for a reason. Standard, plain and inoffensive, no part of it stands out. Different doesn't equate to interesting."
malefashionadvice,3e1u7y,Goobera,3,Tue Jul 21 15:02:42 2015 UTC,"Different levels of experience mean you feel more or less comfortable with certain choices and items of clothing, both in terms of 'I could pull this off' and 'this is boring and I could do something cooler'. Again, for someone who is just getting in, those items are a good first step in the process. They are not the be all end all but the psychological value of them to OP is that they are better, and that's the reason he's interested.   Yes, there is more variation in t-shirts and shirts than in polos, but most people don't rush into buying wacky rick owens and walter van beirendonck shirts and shit. You have to wade in first. Polos, chinos and shirts are a safe way to get started, make it clear you care, but not be way out there yet.  You talk about brands like GBV and Kamakura, but people who just start off have no idea who they are. It's a learning process.  Also, from checking out your comment history to see how deep into fashion stuff you are, I found:   People have different tastes, who'd have thought?   -you, 6 days ago :P  This is the entire point anyway. He likes them. It's his opinion they're an upgrade. In your eyes they may not be, but that doesn't really matter to him. They don't stand out to us, but people still notice that you're paying attention to what you wear. I may not think he's a huge fashion buff, and that's fine. He's not. Maybe he will be, but right now he's just trying to get into it all. Let him do his thing. You don't need to shit on his first attempt at expanding his wardrobe. It's likely he knows just as well as you do that polos and chinos aren't exactly avant-garde."

It's currently at 5 3/4th inches as I'm growing it out for a top knot. I use superhold because it does a great job of creating the pompadour/slick back that I'm currently using. Typical short sides long top.   Cement is a lot harder to wash out than the pomade. It definitely comes with the fact that it is a clay, but it is quite a bit harder to wash out and I find that unlike the pomade which I can wash out with just water I usually need a little soap to completely wash it out. Cement is a bit easier to take out of the tub than American crew fiber and I was able to warm it up pretty quickly as compared to crew fiber  it still has the same layrite smell as pomade The nail in the coffin for me was that cement was way too hard to spread through my hair. I can see it definitely working much better for people with shorter hair or thinner hair but for me I couldn't spread it through my hair as much as I wanted to.

Wet hair, add texturizing or thickening product, then blow dry to style until hair locks into place. If you try to move or displace your hair with your hand,your hair should bounce back to where you styled it.  Now you can add finishing product:  For a matte look that will naturally move, bounce, and eventually fall throughout the day, go with a waxy product like Fiber.  For a more shiny look with a lot of hold, go with a pomade. Layrite, Imperial, Suavecito, whatever you prefer.  For a bit of extra hold, mist hair spray from arm's length."

malefashionadvice,3e31cv,Kain33x,4,Tue Jul 21 18:25:43 2015 UTC,"Are you pulling your shoulders back as if you are holding a stick between them? If you do that your lower back should also slightly arch. Don't over do the arch though.  I sit on the bench, pull my shoulders up, rotate them down and pull them back, then I lie down on the bench and get my pinkie finger near the silver indication rings on the bar then I unrack the weight. (olympic bar has these silver rings). If your grip is too close, its not a bench press but close grip bench press and this works triceps more.  You might have to use other grip, the longer your arms the worse bench is. I suggest watching a video on youtube for this, it gives you a better idea than somebody describing it with text.  If it still does not work for you, then bench press just isn't for you and thats okay you can still build a nice chest with dumbell chest press too (incline, flat, decline)."

Basically, skewing the amount of light reflected by white to include more blue (highest energy light visible) than other colors does tend to make it look brighter to our human eyes, and it compliments the yellowing that is common on whites.  You are mentioning detergent. I imagine you are talking about special detergents that contain another type of bluing, which is actually an ultraviolet dye that fluoresces; in sunlight, it absorbs invisible ultraviolet light and it re-emits it as visible light, causing the clothes to actually glow.  But, yes, having blue dye end up in your white clothes is well known to make them ""whiter,"" subjectively. Don't turn them all the way blue though."

I am a huge fan of bleach, so all of my whites get bleached. As a single guy, it takes a while to build up a big enough load of whites to justify it, even though a wear a white undershirt under everything.... i mean everything, even under other tshirts. I have also started noticing that my towels had begun to start smelling sour lately. Switched detergents, added fabric softener, still getting that sour smell, even when other clothes from the same load smelled fine. So what I started doing was starting my load of whites with detergent, bleach and fabric softener and letting them soak for about 15 mins. Then I put my towels in the same water and finish the wash cycle. I havent had any issues, whites come out bright and towels come out super soft, smell great and no discoloration. So thats always an option for those that want to bleach their whites but don't have enough for a full load"

malefashionadvice,3e31ek,Metcarfre,7,Tue Jul 21 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,   Was wondering if anyone has been in this situation. Not fashion related, but I know there's a bunch of people my age here that might be able to help.   So it's been about a year since my group of friends and I have all graduated with degrees in similar fields (engineering). We've always been keeping in touch, going out to monthly dinners or events to catch up. Compared to my friends in this group, one could say that I'm currently the most 'successful' (higher salary, traveling more, climbing the ladder faster, etc), even though I didn't have the best academic record in the group (actually, I might have been the worst). I'm not a flashy guy and I keep my finances to myself, but we share with each other since we're all close friends.  Once in a while, someone would make a subtle comment about how I should pay for the whole group's dinner or take everyone out on vacation or buy them each a car (I bought one for my mom a few months after buying one for myself). I would usually just laugh it off as a joke, but sometimes it gets a bit obvious that some people in the group don't think I deserve to be where I am.  Sometimes I feel guilty that I'm doing 'better' and not stressing about bills, while some guys had to get second jobs. But I got to where I am because I busted my ass and put in the work. I know that if the roles were switched, I would be nothing but happy for them and would strive to create more opportunities for a better career. Sometimes I consider skipping out on the dinners fearing that the topic might cause an argument and I'd lose a great group of friends.  Anyone been in a situation like this? How'd you guys deal with it?  Thanks in advance!"
malefashionadvice,3e31ek,MfaLurker123,17,Tue Jul 21 16:23:33 2015 UTC,"I think like most engineers your friends aren't socialized very well.

The reality is that it's not usually the case, and I think that can be upsetting to some. Of course you have to work hard and study, but networking, personality, hard work, drive, etc...are just as much if not more important. Sometimes it's hard to accept that, particularly when somebody who didn't have as good of grades in college is more successful. I'm nowhere near the same level of financial success, but I think most people that I know perceive me to be due to the nature of my work, so I've dealt with some similar jokes or comments. It gets a little frustrating, but as long as you're not a dick about it and pushing for expensive restaurants or bragging about trips and purchases, they'll get over it."

Not in the exact same way, but there have been times I felt I needed to apologise for the ""privileges"" I had and the rest of my friends didn't. Like the others said, there's absolutely no reason to feel guilty of your success. You've earnt it through hard work and you should be proud and happy about that.   As for your friends' reaction, it's not the first timer I've heard that. People are weird and they sometimes think that you're bragging about the good things that happen in your life, even if all you do is be happy about it (I honestly don't know how they expect you to react). A lot of people are jealous of those who are successful (yes, sometimes even their friends) because many of them think success just ""happens"" to you. Anyway, if you want my piece of advice, be a little generous from time to time (as Met said, buying them a round of drinks never hurt) but if you gradually find yourself feeling more stressed than happy when you're about to meet them, it'll probably be better to start looking for some other friends. Or have an honest talk with them. You never know, it might work!"

They said by managing her diet and what not we can make her comfortable at least, and it sounds like she's in earlier stages so hopefully we'll have a few months left with her at least.   Still, not easy, she's not a terribly old cat, we expected she'd be around a lot longer. She's the absolute sweetest pet I've ever had too, losing her sooner is gonna be tough :/ She really meant a lot to my mom too, so that's always hard. I was actually out at a coffee when I got the news, trying to stay collected in public sucks. Gonna go home middle of next week, so hopefully even if it's very worst case scenario, I'll still get to see her again."

The vet said there could be some toxin like antifreeze in the neighborhood that they're getting into. Did the vet mention giving the cat subcutaneous water injections? We got needles and a water bag and once a day would hold him tight and put a couple hundred mL of liquid under his skin, since I guess a consequence of kidney failure is severe dehydration. This is just a palliative measure since the damage is irreversible and fatal, but it seemed to really help him."

I bought the Tan Harness belt here: http://www.orionleathercompany.com/40mm-Tan-Leather-Belt-With-Natural-Edge-p/40mmhtanrawedgewdlp2686govblk.htm  First thing - the SMELL. I was expecting a strong leather smell from the natural leather. Instead the thing reeks of whatever wax they used. There is no leather smell whatsoever.   Next is the general finish quality, there is no brand stamp as seen in this photo (https://massdrop-cf2.imgix.net/resizer/750x500/r/orionnaturalharnessbelt1.png?fm=jpg&q=70). In fact, the inside of the belt looks nothing like that photo. There's so much wax caked on the thing, that it looks like i could scrape it off with a spoon.  I know the full grain leather starts off stiff and breaks in over time, but there is nothing ""luxurious"" feeling about the leather. It feels cheap. I have an RM Williams Solid Hide leather belt and even a cheap ""genuine leather"" belt from a mall store and they both feel higher quality than the Orion.

After much shopping around, I've found three pairs that I really dig, but obviously can't afford to buy more than one and I'm having a lot of trouble choosing.  Oni - Probably the most conventional of the three and I love the color. Most affordable, and presumably the most durable option with 20 oz. denim.  Kapital - The texture is a little unusual but I personally really like the way it looks, wondering if color-wise these are the most versatile.  Blue Blanket IJJs - A little concerned about the old-school fit being a little too loose as I'm a pretty tall, slim guy, but I like everything else about them. Not for everyone but I like the general aesthetic. I'm moving to the south in a few weeks and I'm thinking maybe the 12 oz. denim will be more comfortable in the heat."

malefashionadvice,3e31dq,thirsty_moore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:11 2015 UTC,"APC's are Petit Standard and PNS, which are closest in cut to the 484, but feature a lower rise and are priced about the same. If you wait on the next 30% sale at J. Crew you can get the price down further. The 484 will lack the finer details of some of the pricier denim, but that shit is moot if your jeans do not fit properly, and that's the hardest part to get right."

malefashionadvice,3e31dq,dom_kennedy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:45 2015 UTC,"I'm in the market for some suede chelsea boots, but would like some advice on what colour to go for. My style is very much in the vein of this and this.  By far my most worn pants are my black skinnies, followed by my lightwash skinnies. Ideally, I'd like to be able to wear the chelseas with either of those, but certainly with my black ones.  The choices I'm considering are:   Snuff suede; either Meermin or Alfred Sargent. My concern with this option is that when paired with my lightwash jeans they will give off a rather cowboy vibe which I do not want at all. Tan suede from Story Et Fall (on the right). This is the option I'm leaning towards atm because the colour goes perfectly with both black and lightwash, but I'm not totally confident in SEF's quality. I also have a vague desire to eventually cop some SLP cropped cigare jodhpurs which would make these redundant, but then I suppose if I like these enough that'll become unnecessary. Taupe suede from Scarosso (another pic). I feel like these will probably go with both jeans, but it's a bit of an odd colour that I haven't seen much so I'm not totally sold. I do really like the look of them from pics though.   So I guess I'm just looking for some more opinions, or more pictures of the above options if anyone has any (ideally with the relevant pants and correctly white-balanced, but I'll take what I can get). Or other options I haven't considered, to make my decision even harder (bare in mind I'll eventually get some black leather chelseas too, so black is probably out).   Paging /u/malti001, /u/plickz, /u/melon_cauli and any other members of the SLP fanclub specifically."

malefashionadvice,3e14m5,mcadamsandwich,3,Tue Jul 21 13:58:50 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, the concept is almost exactly the same. One of the interesting differences is how the 2 brands executed the idea. The Lance Mountains have paint that appears almost as if it was spray painted on (an homage to graffiti culture and skate cultures close ties, no doubt), while the converse are clearly brush painted (you can see brush strokes if you look closely).  This affects the overal way that the paint will come off - lance mountains don't chip quite as much, and I think the paint takes longer to come off.  kind of interesting how a very similar concept can end up with some significant differences due to the underlying inspiration and execution!"

malefashionadvice,3e37nt,sgri0b,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:47 2015 UTC,I don't have a suit (I'm 19 and this is my first service) is a dark gray sweater over an ocbd alright or is it too much?  Here in Virginia it's blazing hot and I don't want to stand out.
malefashionadvice,3e37nt,BisCasToTheBone,2,Tue Jul 21 17:22:10 2015 UTC,"Why would you put on a sweater if it's hot? Don't do that, it will be uncomfortable and you'll look odd.  The standard outfit for the occasion would be a black suit, black shoes, dark tie, and white shirt. People will excuse you for not including the suit jacket if you're young. People will also excuse you for not including the suit jacket if it's very hot. So, black (or at least dark) dress pants with your white shirt should be fine.  The OCBD is not ideal, but you're young enough that people probably don't expect you to have a formal wardrobe yet, so it's good enough. Actually, if there are people who don't care about dressing properly, you might even see some wearing polo shirts, and in that case you'd look good by comparison.  I think people assumed that you meant ""Can I wear a white suit to a memorial service"", and in that case the answer would be no."
malefashionadvice,3e37nt,sgri0b,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:05 2015 UTC,"That would be okay. So probably would a sportcoat instead of the sweater. Or if it's all you've got, just a nice plain shirt (OCBD, dress shirt, etc.) tucked into pants. (It's okay if the shirt is white - when you said ""wear white"" I was envisioning something flashy like a white suit, white pants, etc.).  Bottom line, do your best approximation of non-standing-out, muted clothes from within your existing wardrobe and once you're there don't feel self-conscious about your clothes. A memorial service is collective mourning, the most important thing is that you're there for the other people and vice versa."

malefashionadvice,3e1hjs,Fashionoff,7,Tue Jul 21 15:11:15 2015 UTC,"Elvis.    Seriously though, a combination of white, brown and blue has a very crisp sort of look when done right.  Try sorting between browns for pants and whites for shirts. Maybe vice a versa?  Not sure if the belt should always match the shoes, but if that's the case there's some good looking blue suede belts out there to be had."

Otherwise, navy trousers and a lighter blue jacket on top. That's the way I wear mine in a more formal manner.  Casually, I'd wear some dark blue jeans with them and any other colour shirt I'd want on top, whether button up or just a tshirt. Generally white.  I prefer the blues with whites and greys aesthetic rather than browns. So it depends on your colour schemes that you enjoy."

It varies based on destination. All the other options have an expected delivery date of 5 days or less regardless of location. This is likely the major, major difference. The size of the package. If you put it in a box, the dimensions have to add up to 36"" or less with no dimension more than 24"". Value of the package. It can't be more than $400. The other options allow up to $2499 or as much as you want to insure it for.

malefashionadvice,3e3wke,steven2014,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:32:40 2015 UTC,A flat cap fits the bill. It has a heritage of working class and sporting activities. It is also probably the easiest hat to wear casually out of all those classic men hats.
malefashionadvice,3e3wke,notfrombudapest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:21 2015 UTC,"A couple of things:   Any bill can be made not-flat. A hat that comes off the shelf looking like this can be bent to look like this. Do you care if there's a logo, brand, or sports insignia on it? What do you have right now, and what do you/don't you like?   In general you're going to get a ton of recommendations for Ebbets, a really great company. You can also get slubbier 5-panels and camp hats from a variety of brands...maybe browse Urban and see if there's anything that catches your interest there. A lot of more boutique brands (Norse Projects, Taylor Stitch, Kapital, etc.) will make a baseball hat every couple of seasons, so it might be worth checking on Grailed as well."

malefashionadvice,3dykyj,Nareshiyengar,11,Mon Jul 20 16:16:09 2015 UTC,"Introduction   I have always been enamored by the idea of Chelsea Boots but never really pursued them. I don’t know what caused the switch in my head to ‘flip’ but all of a sudden I found myself looking around for different brands to look into.  This review is based on one day of wear, so I’ll have more solid remarks in a few weeks.  The Acquisition  I didn’t know if I could pull off Chelsea Boots the way I wanted to, but I decided that I wanted to try. I didn’t want to spend too much on a pair.  I looked into Bexley and I also looked into Jack Erwin before realizing that I definitely wanted mine to be suede (in true Yeezy fashion). I then looked at Carmina  reviewed here. I love these boots, but I wasn’t quite sure I wanted to spend that much yet since I didn’t know how I would like them (they didn’t have my size). After looking around, I settled decided on Meermin.. These cost me $246.75 USD through PayPal and arrived exactly one week after ordering.   Closer Examination   I didn’t really include many photos of my inspection, but the stitching at the welt seems solid. I’d say it could be better, but I’m happy for the price I paid. There’s one nail on the right heel that isn’t as far in the sole as the rest, but I’m pretty sure it won’t be an issue. There’s one spot right here that I’m not terribly happy about, but it’s not a huge deal.  The boots look a bit lighter in person, I’d say, as opposed to on the Meermin website, but it’s pretty close.  The Fit   These are on the Hiro last which is a single E width. I had emailed Meermin asking about sizing, and they sent me insole measurements (length, width) which I compared to my foot tracing measurements and decided on TTS UK, meaning I am a US 9 and ordered an 8 UK. I’d say the fit is pretty immaculate. The idea of laceless boots is going to take some getting used to, but I love just being able to pull them on a lot. I have a feeling these will be my running errand boots.  Like I said, the boots fit well, but the soles are quite stiff right out of the box, but I’m confident that when the break-in process is over these will fit like a dream.  Conclusion  I’m very satisfied with my decision with these boots. I love the Fox Suede that Carmina has, but I think that at the end of the day I prefer the Rapello suede.  I love the way the color varies depending on light. They’re darker in low light but look quite light in bright light (don’t mind the water jug, lol).  At the price point, I’d recommend them, but if you could be persuaded to up your budget I would probably suggest Carmina. They have a Polo Suede pair that's up for preorder on Skoaktiebolaget, and I have no doubts that they will be fantastic.  What’s Next?  What’s next for me? Hopefully nothing in the near future, but we all know that’s not happening. I’m gonna take a step back and look at what I have and go from there. Maybe a pair of Rancourt/Alden Loafers.  Thanks for reading, and let me know if you have any questions!"

My job involves customer interaction 15% of the time where business casual is necessary and 85% of the time is completely casual.  Chinos are pretty versatile in a business casual or casual setting. Olive or khaki would be your best colors. Summer is in full swing, so a pair of khaki shorts would also work well.   You can get a nice pair of white converses or something more expensive like a pair of Common Projects if that's within your budget. If you want to look good on a Friday, a pair of chestnut wingtips (Allen Edmond Strands) look good with chinos.   Personally if the dress code is casual, I would wear my sneakers as much as possible. Treat the parts of your body that touches the ground well. Shoes, beds, and chairs are worth the investment.

And you missed my point entirely just because it is made in China doesn't mean it's bad quality it is in fact the exact opposite China produces amazing quality goods if you are at the right factory.   Also people don't outsource to China to cut cost it is actually expensive to manufacture there as apposed to Indonesia Malaysia etc. They manufacture there because of the infrastructure scale and quality.

They're just average joes who don't really have a good feel for business so after a year or two they begin to get complacent or tired (they probably don't take many vacations!) and begin to let backorders stack up and fall behind.  I'm really into cars and building engines etc. so if you want any big companies in the car scene who have similar stories: old skool vulkanwerks and Swedish Ops. So you can see this issue probably occurs across a variety of different interests and groups. I rarely trust one man operations because you don't know when they'll go sour.

malefashionadvice,3dwug3,NotClever,33,Mon Jul 20 09:42:20 2015 UTC,Mauro from Wolf vs. Goat is trying to gear up to do a leather MTM project.  If you go through some of the TOJ forum he's one of the most vocal guys about how shitty TOJ got.
malefashionadvice,3dwug3,d4nimal,17,Mon Jul 20 10:31:38 2015 UTC,This will never be anything near what ToJ was. Mauro is generally a good guy but his designing chops are lacking and in my opinion he will try to have too much influence on that part of the design. I also would question the leather and construction being anywhere similar in quality if it's the same price point.   Hoping to be proved wrong though!
malefashionadvice,3dwug3,NotClever,8,Mon Jul 20 14:13:19 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. I love the guy and his honesty, and I highly enjoy his basic clothes, but based on the samples he has posted of what he thinks are exciting leather jacket designs from the factories he's visited I'm not optimistic. They strike me as the paper thin, nappa leather, overdesigned junk you see at nordstrom rack. Disregarding quality concerns, his designs are almost undoubtedly going to be very different from ToJ.  And he's looking at having them produced in Italy. As you said, I don't see how he can come up with a similar price point at a similar quality level to ToJ. And it's weird to me that he would claim he's going to, because he's always been about going for premium quality and not caring that it's going to cost an insane amount."
malefashionadvice,3dwug3,MjoLniRXx,3,Mon Jul 20 15:00:18 2015 UTC,"I think all that is valid (as well as your above post).  If I were him I would bring out a simple bomber to start and keep it at that for a bit.  What I think would be more helpful is if he had close up pics of his leather sample grains and thickness rather than a full shot of some blue leather jacket from afar.  At the moment the whole thing is up in the air as to whether or not it will be 1) feasible 2) good enough quality and design to warrant interest 3) price point that would match anywhere in the range of what TOJ was doing.  I think we'll just have to wait and see, though again I think your concerns are not unfounded."
malefashionadvice,3dwug3,NotClever,2,Mon Jul 20 15:13:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think he just gets really excited and can't help posting stuff like that. My one real fear for him is if he for some reason wants to prove that he can do ToJ better than ToJ, and I don't really think that's going to happen, at least from a design standpoint. And if he starts fiddling with that stuff it will take time away from his core competency, I think."
malefashionadvice,3dwug3,d4nimal,2,Mon Jul 20 15:20:38 2015 UTC,Just to add a bit of nuance. He was really excited about the leather quality/possibilities of those samples. Those were not his samples. They were simply things the manufacturers showed off to show what they were capable of.
malefashionadvice,3dwug3,NotClever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:13:31 2015 UTC,"Right, and I thought I said that, but I just thought they looked tacky, so him being excited about them causes me to worry."
malefashionadvice,3dwug3,PostResign,2,Tue Jul 21 14:39:49 2015 UTC,"I think we'd all agree it'd be silly to think it would be similar in style or try to directly replace TOJ.  WvG also has more of a European casual menswear flavor to me as well, so I would expect more along that design aesthetic rather than fashion-forward double riders and streetwear etc.  From his thread posts he seems to be pretty amped about the quality of the construction and leather.  Obviously, I can't substantiate any of that without first hand experience, so a lot of that remains to be seen, as you said.  Regardless, I think the potential is intriguing at the very least."
malefashionadvice,3dwug3,NotClever,2,Mon Jul 20 14:44:46 2015 UTC,"IMHO, he's amped about the quality and construction because he's visiting Italian factories that are wowing him with their customer list. I could be off, but that's the way it sounded to me. I like him a lot and I think he provides a unique product with a unique business model (that I suspect is similar to ToJ in giving away a lot more value to the customer than he needs to), but he appears to be relying on his suppliers for assessment of quality."
malefashionadvice,3dwug3,Softcorps_dn,6,Mon Jul 20 15:06:01 2015 UTC,It's more like mauro's using that list to wow the people reading the thread who don't necessarily understand why things like consistent tension and straight stitching are so expensive when making leathers. Iirc he's spent lots of time learning traditional tailoring and garment construction and a lot of that is lost on even the people who keep up the wvg thread on a day to day basis   Send him an email and he can break things down for you on pretty much any subject related to clothing if you'd like
malefashionadvice,3dwug3,NotClever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:10:55 2015 UTC,"Could be, which is why I said I don't really know. As far as I've seen he just posted some pictures of, in my opinion, janky looking jackets and who the factories produced for, which seemed a bit unusual compared to his usual focus on the material source and quality. The whole thing just struck me as him getting a bug to outdo TOJ and posting the results of very preliminary questioning, is all."
malefashionadvice,3dwug3,Hahahahahahai,3,Mon Jul 20 16:32:37 2015 UTC,"Well, you can't deny that the fall of TOJ left a pretty sizable hole in a somewhat niche market. I'm sure a lot of people are tempted to try and step up to fill that opening."

Firstly, the wait times were becoming alarmingly long.

Call me old-fashioned, but something like a leather jacket costing several hundreds of dollars, I really want to try on and I really want to buy from a reputable place.

He took money which was meant for production, spent it to maintain/upgrade his lifestyle, lied to customers about delays, lied to employees about their pay (Charly has 1 year of no pay IIRC) and still refuses to come clean. It was hardly a downwards spiral but rather a massive coverup based on heaps of lies by him, along with downplaying of concerns and bullying by some senior members at SF. After dieworkwear and SF members started trying to pursue legal action, he tried to manipulate BradT into being his scapegoat/spokesperson and continued to lie to him about what was going on.

malefashionadvice,3dwug3,Goobera,9,Mon Jul 20 06:04:16 2015 UTC,"Simple supply and demand. If you can't scale up production and maintain acceptable quality, keep the volume down and charge a higher price.  The even simpler thing would be what they tried to implement (in a half assed way). If demand is too high, say that you can no longer accept any more new orders OR PEOPLE'S MONEY (which is what they failed to do) and work off the backlog. Once the backlog is worked off, restart the cycle. The one problem with this approach is that you are limiting the amount of money you can generate and are unable to have a continuous cash flow."

malefashionadvice,3dwug3,NotClever,6,Mon Jul 20 14:20:06 2015 UTC,"Well, esssentially, production is done by Moon Leather Company, with Charly handling orders/sizing, and Dan (IIRC) handling shipping and Drew providing cuts.  The only thing which they could lack is output, in terms of leather, and input, in terms of skilled workers. Both of which, only really have a marginal increase in cost/unit. I hardly think that the leather workers solely work on ToJ and can't amp up work or that such a small company can cause an increase in leather prices.  Also, I trust that insiders, like fok, know more about such margins. I believe he has elaborated on it in the ToJ thread before, but in all honesty, I'm too lazy to find it. I've found a reddit comment which suggests that their margin wouldn't be too bad, or at least comparable to other leather jacket companies.  edit: If you want to find it, I believe it's about where things start heating up in the ToJ thread, spreadsheet and all."

Thus, indicating that the leather they use is comparable to other competitor's at his price range. Certainly not the same leather tom ford uses in his $10000 jackets as he claimed.  Also not high quality doesn't equate to cheap leather."

I've been making shirts independently for some people and one guy requested a hidden button-down so I decided to make one for myself! It could be longer, I went for the more casual look with this one. I just hate it when shirts are long enough to wear tucked in but TOO long to wear untucked.   Not trying to sell you, but if you'd like one (with a few tweaks), I can make you one ;)"

If you want to keep the pants, I'd say definitely change the shoes and the shirt might work better in the outfit. Hard to say without seeing it though, might have to change the shirt or add an outside layer or something like that."

malefashionadvice,3dyiph,CaliforniaBaeArea,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:58 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I'll be honest and say I'm not a fan. It's a lighter color jacket and when the fabric bunches up or doesn't fit ideally it casts shadows in areas outlining the fit, or that's how I see it.   I know it's possible with the sales that banana has to get a jacket like that for 80 bucks and tailor it. Just this past month since like June 10 there was a mad sale.   If you get familiar with a company's sizing it's easiest. I stick to club Monaco and BR right now mostly because they have what I like and in my price range when on sale, and I know my size in them. I would caution against tailoring something unless you KNOW it will fit properly afterwards. So don't try and fit a garment that needs a lot of work, there's really only so much that can and should be done."

malefashionadvice,3dxwmy,Orionmcdonald,2,Mon Jul 20 17:50:38 2015 UTC,"I've got two pair of black chelseas - one tall and one short. My short ones are a little shorter than those but they're the ones I wear most of the time - they're also a little sleeker, have a lower heel and are a bit lighter and softer leather than my tall ones so there's a couple of reasons I prefer them most of the time. I do like the feel of the lower boot on my ankle/lower leg though and they show off socks better when I sit down.  Of those two, I'd probably wear the lower ones for the height and the fact that I like the sleeker footprint and profile better too, but that's just me.  I find black chelseas look great with black & grey pants and jeans too, however, someone mentioned in another thread how they found them to work great either casual or dressed up but not as well in between and I've found that to be true too. Jeans & t-shirt - great. Black/grey chinos/slacks and a dress shirt - great (killer with a suit!). Black/grey chinos and a tshirt - something feels off.  edit: I should probably add I wear my pants legs over all my boots instead of stacking them against the top or stuffing them inside, if that makes a difference."

The short ones kind of make your feet look long) and like actual boots instead of more feminine booties or something. The 'versatility' difference is pretty negligible, so I think it comes down to personal preference really. Get them in black leather.  Also the short ones have a slender, pointy toe box which is a bad look imo. A round toe box is for sure the way to go."

If you are trying to go minimalist/monochrome with your wardrobe then do it up, just make sure to get the right styling of a black blazer.  Something like this from Arc'teryx Veilence is unique enough to be on the more casual end of black blazers.  I'm sure there are more out there that fit this formality criteria.  Outfits sound good too, footwear will play a large role in this too.   Is there a reason why you wouldn't get one?    No... Actually, I want one.  Just haven't found the right one to buy yet.

There are various reasons for that. One reason is that black is a very severe, formal color and under daylight tends to look harsh and wash out the complexion of the person wearing it (i'm caucasian - it might be different for other races or ethnicities).  Low artificial light has a different effect, and that's one reason for the ""no dinner jackets before nightfall"" rule.

I'd pair it with similarly dark-coloured trousers, like a really dark purple or burgundy. I don't think navy works at all for pants with a black jacket.  Unless you had something with a lot of texture for the jacket, say if it was velvet, or was a black/grey houndstooth pattern (as an example) then you're going to have some problems with versatility if it was a flat black jacket."

I'd say if you do, it's much easier to pull off if the sport coat looks like one - details like soft construction, patch pockets, patterns/obvious texture, seasonal fabrics, etc. all help it look like it's not a mismatched suit jacket worn with different pants (and Dan Terpanier's punchable face).  For example, a rumpled black or grey cotton or linen unconstructed blazer would be a great look in the summer with a white polo or button-down.  On a related note, I have a black felted wool blazer (made of the thicker wool used for overcoats and peacoats) I use for the winter time. It looks great with some flannel grey slacks and black wingtips, derbies, or boots, and the black combined with its wintery nature suits it despite it being an unconventional color choice for a blazer. It just needs to not look like a traditional black suit jacket."

I don't have any photos, but I was thinking shorts used in 'short suits' - they seem sharper to me.  Wingtips were what I had in mind. Boat shoes are way too casual to me.  I think if you're going to wear the waistcoat with shorts the whole look needs to be sharp. If you start wearing more casual shorts and boat shoes, you may as well lose the waistcoat.  Think of the approach like this would work * Don't dress up casual clothes by adding a waistcoat; * Do dress down dress clothes by removing and replacing items.

The leather is thick as boot so it makes it heavier than i'd like. I usually swap between shoulder strap/briefcase while carrying it and have received the most compliments on this bag than any of my accessories. i've got a 14"" laptop and it fits in there easy, along with an ipad & a water bottle, they come in a variety of sizes and their customer service was very helpful."

Not saying they don't have some good stuff, just that I wouldn't strike polos entirely off the list. There are some nice ones out there.  Also, the manager laughing and the coworkers staring will drop off as they get used to the new you. Just stay consistently sharp looking, and they will stop noticing. As /u/badger0511 said, the thing they'll start noticing is how they don't look as good as you do! I recently went through a similar change, and the first time people saw me, they asked if I was going on an interview or what was with the new look.

I can assume you don't necessarily report to them, but I'm sure they exist in your company. So think of it not as dressing for your manager, but dressing for your boss's boss. I highly doubt dressing sharply will hold you back. If your work can speak for itself, dressing well should only magnify it. Dress for the job you want, and all that jazz.   I understand the issues you may have with coworkers who choose not to dress well, I grew up around physicists and I've dated in the engineering crowd, but to dress the way you want, with confidence, is an immensely attractive thing. Everyone feels a little awkward when they change styles, but what is style, if not another way to get attention. I think you should continue your style evolution. Don't listen to what coworkers who've never tried on a well fitting shirt say. If you have the funds for slightly more extravagent purchases, then go ahead and buy them. You don't tell your coworkers how to spend their money, and they have zero rights to tell you how to spend yours."

Unlike him, I don't wear pleats or cuffed pants, or solid button down dress shirts.  This isn't a tech company but a 100+ year old car company.

malefashionadvice,3dy026,SaggyMidgetBooty,29,Mon Jul 20 13:36:13 2015 UTC,"Floridian here- you poor bastard...   Priority #1- SUNBLOCK. In Florida, you can remove clothing and not be a weirdo- it's hot here and we know it. However, if any of that supple, pasty white delicious nourishment skin is visible to the sun, it's getting cooked. Ever seared a steak so the outside is cooked but the inside is still juicy and tender? Yeah, that's gonna be you when you go back home and order some tea and crumpets looking like a cooked lobster. SPF30 or higher.   If you think you'll be able to keep up with applying sunblock, then invest in some cheap tank tops. We can get them here at Old Navy for about $3 each. Light colors. Wearing anything darker than a medium blue is just begging to become a baked potato. Marinated in sweat, of course.   Are V-necks still in style? Buy some anyway. Again, get the cheap/thin kind. The V helps with airing out. Apply sunblock to your chest if wearing a V neck  Linen shorts (or loose linen pants). Dear God, don't be caught in the daytime wearing pants. Your underwear will be soaked through in short order. And on the topic of underwear, wear boxers and apply powder. Swamp-ass is a thing here and chafing hurts, especially with the amount of walking you'll do.   Buy a hat. If it's got mesh, great. If it's designed to keep your head warm, leave it at home. If it's a ball cap, Apply sunblock to ears.   Bring a sweat rag. Or three. Buy a compact poncho. You will be rained on every day anywhere from 2pm-5pm, but don't worry- it'll be over in a few minutes. Swim trunks are also a great idea. We've found that pools provide excellent relief to the heat. Also, Apply sunblock during this time.    We look forward to receiving you, and watching as your excitement quickly changes to regret to choosing Alaska for your trip. See you soon...   tl;dr- you want thin, breathable clothing. You're either going with the goal of sweat absorption or sweat prevention (haha. ha.). Light colors are best. Protect exposed skin with sunblock. Prepare for daily (almost German scheduled) rain for a few minutes. Get a hat.   Feel free to send a PM if you're heading down to Miami at all. We can sweat together where all the bikini-wearing women are."

I wish tank tops were an option but I'm only slim.  V-necks might be a good option, I have heard that crewnecks feel a bit too tight in the heat.  I wasn't even considering bringing jeans/trousers, just some chino shorts that I'm hoping will do. Your point about boxers though is a good one, I didn't even consider chafing.  Would you happen to have any good recommendations on a hat that won't make me look ridiculous? Caps aren't really a thing in the UK unless you're really young or really old. Maybe they're acceptable in your neck of the woods though. And I don't quite have the neckbeard to pull off a fedora.  Sadly I'll probably be stuck in Orlando, surrounded by children and Brazilian tourists. Thanks anyway!"

Some of them have a smaller brim but that's be honest...you want to cover as much as space as possible on your body. Make sure air actually flows through the hat, so no super tight weave. Save yourself the trouble with packing one at home and buy one in Florida.  Edit: the good Floridians gave you good advice with sun block and that you should re-apply it oftenly. Please remember that you need to re-apply after any bath or shower."

But you will not look out of place by wearing a straw hat with a brim or a bucket hat. Whatever suits your style, really.

malefashionadvice,3dy026,wisstig96,5,Mon Jul 20 22:37:55 2015 UTC,"Disney World cast member here. To be frank, nobody cares if you look bad. It's almost expected. It's hot, you're on vacation, we all understand.  Two pairs of shorts should be adequate as long as you're willing to accept that they're going to be damp with sweat by the end of every day, and most of the parks have water rides where you're likely to get them soaked. It's also going to rain very hard every afternoon, on and off, for about ten minutes at a time. The Disney hotels have laundry facilities for guests, so if you're there and suddenly decide you can't bear to wear the same sweat-crusted shorts for one more day, you can always wash them.  You'll probably be more comfortable if you get a few pairs of linen shorts, or something similarly light and thin that dries quickly. One popular option is to wear swim trunks all the time. Does it look good? Not really. Are you going to be judged for it? Absolutely not.  I would probably invest in a few more shirts, especially if you don't want to do laundry. You're not going to want to get more than one day out of them with the amount of sweating that you're going to be doing. Light colors are your friends. Cotton is good, but technical fabrics will keep you a bit cooler.  As for shoes, for the Disney portion of your trip, you're going to be doing a lot of walking. A lot. I went into Epcot for about two hours just to get lunch today and walked three miles, according to my phone. People do it in flip-flops, but I don't recommend it. I usually wear cloth boat shoes, because they're lightweight and they dry quickly. Socks will just get wet and stay that way, which will ruin your day very quickly.  If you're going to want to go to a nicer restaurant or something, a decent linen shirt will serve you well with your chino shorts. Even in more formal settings, dress in Florida is almost always fairly casual due to the heat. In all but the most high-end restaurants, it's rare to see a jacket. As a bonus, even the better restaurants in the parks themselves in Disney World are very casual-dress. Whatever you wear into the park is fine for them. They know you've been walking around in the hot sun all day; nobody expects you to change to go in to eat dinner. If you're going to a nice restaurant in one of the hotels, though, you should probably dress a little better.  As /u/hartke20g said, sunblock is important. Apply it often. If you feel like you're burning, you're already burnt. Make sure to keep hydrated, too. In Disney World, any of the food and beverage stands that have paper cups will give you a cup of ice water for free if you ask, so there's no reason whatsoever to go thirsty.  As for some Disney-specific tips that aren't related to clothes, try to get to the parks early in the day. If you can get there when they open, that's even better. The lines are usually shorter in the morning, it rains less, and it's a bit cooler. I like to go play in the morning, then come back in to rest/nap in the afternoon, and go out again in the evening once it's cooled off. There's also something called Fastpass+ that's included with your park admission that you should familiarize yourself with. Basically, it lets you make a reservation for the attractions. You get a one-hour window to show up to the attraction, scan your park ticket, and then go right on the ride without waiting in the main queue. It can cut a two hour wait down to ten minutes or less. The farther in advance you book them, the better, because the best ones run out early. I'd especially recommend getting them for Toy Story Midway Mania, Seven Dwarves Mine Train, and the Anna and Elsa meet and greet (if you're into that). The wait times for those are consistently very long. You'll want to book those passes at least several days in advance to make sure you get them."

Wear lighter shirts (color and fabric) get a hat and use sunscreen/sunblock for sure. I wouldn't wear flip flops to Disney because of the amount of walking, I normally wear either Nike running shoes or Puma Suede classics if it is after the rainy time. Let us know how Disney goes, you'll love it. Also get fast pass early in the morning for better times."

I own several pairs now where I purchased them as ""Classic"" fit (Dad pants) and had my tailor taper them and reshape the seat. In my experience, each job you get on a pair of pants costs roughly $20 so if you are getting a taper, reshape, and a new hem, you will be looking at around $60 per pair but they will fit like they were custom made which brings up the option of just buying MTM pants.

I say keep it simple with a classic, fitted bomber or trucker style jacket. I think you should avoid styles like the Schott Perfecto, which in my opinion gets costumey fast if you're not careful.   Really, just don't pull a Ziggy Sobotka and you'll be good.  As far as shoes go, why not go full McQueen with a pair of brown suede chukkas?

malefashionadvice,3dzrif,tripletruble,2,Tue Jul 21 00:19:30 2015 UTC,"Black raw denim won't 'fade' in the same way as indigo raw denim for the simple reason that indigo dye isn't actually a very good form of fabric dye. It doesn't penetrate the warp thread fully and basically sits on top of it and literally falls off from the friction that movement and wear causes. That's the reason for the much coveted 'fades' with indigo raw denim.  Black dye is much better at the job it's intended to do, so black raw denim will fade in a much more uniform manner to a grey colour over an extended period of time (especially from repeated washing). You may be able to achieve some whiskers, honeycombs and suchlike, but not to the same extent as indigo jeans.   Same applies to any jeans that aren't indigo dyed.   If your aim is to keep your black jeans as black as possible for as long as possible - avoid washing them too often."

You spend a lot of money on a rare stamp, you're probably never gonna use it but you do it cause you love it. Fashion is different in the sense that the 'hobby' items are ones that you can apply in everyday life. You can use your expensive items to display that this is what you do and what you care about.

I probably wore the same 5 pairs of pants through four years of college and then next four years of odd jobs and travels.   Buying more expensive clothes has been a gradual process, with lots of influence from MFA. Now that I have a better job and live in a fashion-forward city, I care more about my appearance.   For that reason, I started buying clothes from trendy second-hand spots and some mall locations. This is relatively inexpensive. I've recently come to appreciate more than the appearance of the clothing. I care as much about how it's  made as I do about how it looks.   I try to stick to a principle of either made in America (where I live), used or has an interesting story. That costs more money.   I don't know that I'll ever pay $300 for a monkey sweater. However, I could see myself pay that much some day for a sweater that was hand knit in Ireland or uses a wool native to my home state.   I still like for a shirt to look good when I put it one, but there's another level of satisfaction when I've achieved some other type of value - supporting the local economy or contributed to someone who cares about the craft and not just the profit."

malefashionadvice,3dws6t,MrSparkle666,6,Mon Jul 20 05:40:13 2015 UTC,"When people say that a $300 sweater is expensive, I think they have a distorted view of the true cost of clothing. This is obviously the result of the fact that there are so many fast-fashion brands and discount retailers these days that are able to sell mass-produced clothing very cheaply. Most of this clothing is made in overseas factories, with inferior quality materials, in poor working conditions by exploited laborers. It distorts people's perceptions of the real value of what they are getting.   That doesn't mean that when you pay $300 for a sweater, you are getting a quality item made in a 1st world country. Often times you really are only paying for a particular brand name or style. Still, I find it interesting that people think a sweater shouldn't cost $300, when a sweater made with quality materials and craftsmanship with no worker exploitation anywhere along the line from sheep to sweater probably should cost around $200-$300 when you factor in all of the costs involved."

For me, if it isn't exactly what I want, I don't buy it. No point in getting something if it's not perfect.  Some might say ""why do you want that $800 pair of shoes? You can get one close enough for $300."" Except 'close enough' isn't the same, and it's not just about paying more. Some things that go into it are quality, styling, materials used, workmanship, and yes even things like brands.  All of which people are willing to pay much more because it's something they want exactly. To that end, I just get everything made for me. It's quite expensive, and I end up buying less, but it means it's perfect. And if I can have perfect, why spend less for something less than perfect?

Any product has its price because the people selling it chose to offer it at that price, so you have to decide whether you want to buy this thing at that price.  Some things need to have higher prices because they use more expensive (and hopefully superior in some way) materials or manufacturing. Some things are more expensive because they have a less common design so there are less economies of scale. Some things are more expensive because they can be expensive as they want, because this is the only item with that exact design, or because it's a popular brand name.  You vote with your dollars and decide for yourself which of these things justify a higher price. If the price isn't worth it, then buy the cheaper thing, or the more standard-issue thing, or you compromise on the design or get a less prestigious brand name."

For me I have a lot more clothes than this, because I'm lazy with donating clothes and they tend to hang around longer than they should, especially since I have a lot of pre-MFA clothes   5 Shirts (OCBD year round, Flannels for the winter, Linen for summer, so more like 7-8) 2 nice pairs of jeans 2 nice pairs of chinos (for me, 4, 2 lightweight, 2 heavyweight A few t-shirts (White, black, grey, heather colors are good too)   Additionally (Because I like to layer and have a jacket problem)   Sweaters: About 4 nice sweaters for layering Jackets:  Spring/fall earth tone jacket Spring/fall black jacket Winter black jacket Winter earth tone jacket   Rotate all these clothes and air them out in between, and have the appropriate number of socks/underthings and you should be good for 2 weeks without laundry. Have gym clothes/outdoorsy clothes if thats your thing as well.  When I say jackets I have:   Brown cord jacket Green field jacket Black field jacket Black leather moto jacket Brown bomber (lined for winter) Black university jacket (heavy wool) Blazer for when needed I want a denim jacket, crap I have a jacket problem   Note: This is for someone in the mid-atlantic region, so my wardrobe has to cover temperatures regularly in the 20's or 10's during the winter and in the mid 90's in the summer."

Here goes:  After researching the ray ban caravans and AO/Randolph sunglasses, I ordered the 55mm ray bans, 58mm ray bans, and the 55 mm Randolphs. After trying them all, I returned all but the 55mm Ray Bans with zero regrets.  The 58mm Ray Bans, to my surprise, were way too big (I have other Ray bans with the same lens and bridge size that fit well). The lenses crowded my face and fell off when I looked at my shoes.  The Randolphs, in addition to being a little bigger than I expected, had another problem. I wanted to love the bayonet temples so much, but they poked into my skull and hit my ears. Painful to wear.  The 55 mm caravans, it turned out, were the ones I wanted. Fit pretty well from the start, and I've been playing with bending them slightly to adjust for an even better fit. Only complaint is that if the sun is shining down from behind me, a little light can reflect off the inside of the lens. This is mitigated with a better fit.  In terms of quality, all three were great with very solid construction. The Randolphs felt like a better piece of engineering, but were heavy and weren't nearly as ""wearable"" for me.  Sorry for the rambling, but I hope this helps!  P.S. AO and Randolph make almost identical products, although I've heard the Randolphs have a little higher quality. AFAIK AO split into two companies a few decades ago, and one side became Randolph. If I ended up liking the Randolphs, I might have swapped for the equivalent AOs and gotten half my money back."

Note: I only sell the heritage line. Red Wings are a tough boot. They will last you forever, but expect a break-in period. They should start by fitting half a size down. That's how I start most people. They should also fit comfortably snug.   You might also see a difference in lasts. My iron ranger fits me great in a 9.5 D, as I'm usually a 9.5 EEE (they run big in my experience). However, my moc toe had a lot of heel slippage in a 9.5, so I went down to a 9 D. After some break in, it feels great. If it's a Redwing store they should try you in multiple sizes.  Personally, I would have started you in an 8 D."
malefashionadvice,3dzxly,pdubba,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:54:34 2015 UTC,Alright. I am going to go back with this pie and exchange it and truly find out the best fit. It's annoying that I did their machine and the size it recommended gives me too much heel slippage.
malefashionadvice,3dz149,TheKnownStranger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:08:16 2015 UTC,"It boils down to preference.  Some people cuff their jeans so that their ankle is always showing.  Some cuff it a bit less.  Some maintain the longer inseam without a cuff to ensure they don't ride up.  I would say, whatever look you prefer, you don't want them to be too long.  Pre-cuff, yes, it is good for the jean to cover your ankle when standing barefoot."
malefashionadvice,3dz149,molloy_the_burglar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:35 2015 UTC,"It depends. I personally like my selvedge jeans to make one fold when standing with a pair of boots on and perfectly straight when I cuff it. When sitting with a pair of loafers / oxfords on, I like seeing a sliver (an inch) of my socks.   With my raw denims, all of that goes down the drain. Stacks / fades take precedence. Cuffing is kept to a minimum. Inseam should be 2 - 3 inch longer than my actual inseam. But that's just my preference."

The downside to grey is you can't really wear it with grey slacks and doesn't look good with khakis, which reduces their versatility with the most common pants colors. That said, they look great with navy chinos or slacks, or brighter colors like cream/white or even jeans."
