Rottweiler,3dz3uf,Grudlann,2,Wed Jul 22 02:56:46 2015 UTC,What a beautiful head! Is he a pure bred? Mother? Father? I'm always interested in bloodlines and that kind of things. :) BTW the only time one of my dogs got a bath was when she decided to roll on a dead fish in a park...
Rottweiler,3dz3uf,ninjawa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:28:53 2015 UTC,Thank you!  Logan is a pure bred and his pedigree can be traced back four generations. Father is Flores' Rascal Ruede Monstrum. Mother is Flores' Camelia. We only bathed him to remove whatever outdoor allergen he rolled in that would fill my arms and cheeks with hives after I would hug him. He was probably over due a bath by a year or two anyway.

Rottweiler,3e0ija,chonkypot,4,Tue Jul 21 00:43:55 2015 UTC,I've heard too many horror stories about laser pointers to use with my dogs. Here's an article I found quickly http://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2013/10/02/pet-laser-toys.aspx

Rottweiler,3dwuck,fatalis_vox,4,Mon Jul 20 04:55:26 2015 UTC,"By and large, Rottweilers bond pretty closely with their primary human. Separation for such a long period can be pretty stressful, even if they like their interim family really well. Over time, they will re-establish that bond with their new humans. As far as they know, they are now in their new home forever. Having to readjust to a new routine and then try to remember the old environment and routine can be emotionally straining for a dog with a disposition to create strong family bonds. Also, having learned new behaviors in his foster home he may be a bit unnerved by the change. You can't explain these environmental changes to dogs. They may understand short term stays for up to a few weeks time if they occur on a regular basis, but 6 months is a lot. I would try to just establish a normal routine and don't try to force any affectionate behaviors but let them return naturally over time. Two of my Rottweilers get pretty distressed when I leave them with a friend or the vet when we go out of town. Having done a lot of foster work, some dogs have no trouble transitioning and any new environment they are in may as well be home. Other dogs take weeks or months to transition and settle in. Providing consistent routine and positive experiences will help. Also, if you are experiencing any emotional stress following your deployment, your dog may pick up on that. If the only issue is that he is not licking you, I would say he's transitioning pretty well. Just give him a little time."
Rottweiler,3dwuck,dedlobster,8,Mon Jul 20 13:53:55 2015 UTC,We had to be seperated from our boy for about 3 months due to quarantine regulations for Hawaii (military move). Most of this is normal for him to get used to you again and will just take some time. You are going to have to reestablish yourself as the alpha and things will fall into place.
Rottweiler,3dwuck,HATERdotCOM,2,Mon Jul 20 05:56:10 2015 UTC,...? why was this down-voted. Take this!
Rottweiler,3dwuck,Jeearr,6,Mon Jul 20 10:19:36 2015 UTC,It was down voted because of the last statement- establishing yourself as alpha is now generally frowned upon by most trainers and behaviorists. People focused on that instead of the rest of the comment.
Rottweiler,3dwuck,jwolf185,2,Mon Jul 20 12:23:06 2015 UTC,"It's not that establishing yourself as the alpha is frowned upon, it's that the whole theory of dogs working on an alpha/beta system is being consistent disproved."
Rottweiler,3dwuck,Pufflehuffy,3,Mon Jul 20 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"And because it's been disproved and actually shown to cause more problems, it's frowned upon and therefore someone who mentions it will probably get downvoted, because it's bad advice. I guess I was overly succinct in my previous comment."
Rottweiler,3dwuck,jwolf185,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:05:43 2015 UTC,Ahh fair enough. I was probably being a wee bit too nitpicky.
Rottweiler,3dwuck,Pufflehuffy,3,Mon Jul 20 20:07:29 2015 UTC,"The separation anxiety is probably just him thinking you might go away again. That said, you left him when he was still pretty young, so it's understandable that he needs to get used to you again. If he was 4 or 5 when you left him, it might have been easier for him to jump right back into your relationship as you left it. Because he was so young, he probably learned a lot while you were away, and you weren't there for that. Just make sure you do a lot with him, and it should go back to normal. Please just enjoy each other, don't worry until it's been like 6 months or so (yes, adapting can take that long)."

Rottweiler,3d5hb6,MamaSpiritBear,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:00:20 2015 UTC,"she is absolutely adorable! where abouts are you located?  if you let her stretch for the food a bit more she'll stand up on her toes to reach (keeping your hold on the leash - just letting her pull a little bit), and this will help if the front feet are a bit forward. if you're not comfortable letting her reach, or ""bait"" for the food, you can take her hind legs back about 1-2 inches and like you said, move her front legs back slightly.   her coat looks a bit wavy right now? when you brush her (give her a bath before shows) brush it off towards the side, not straight back. this will hide the waves a bit."
Rottweiler,3d5hb6,charslo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:55:32 2015 UTC,"Northern AZ!  Yep she definitely has some wave-both parents are quite straight so hopefully it straightens as she grows, but we'll see. üòä. Thanks for the tip about brushing to the side, wouldn't have thought to try that.  Also-thanks, I'll try having her stretch for it.  I am having a hard time setting her feet properly, she mostly keeps them where I place them, but from my perspective I always think it's good but when I look at the pictures my husband took for me her feet aren't where I thought.  Ha!  We're going to the show in Flagstaff next weekend, get her used to the show noise and chaos, and a couple weeks later her first handling class, so I'm excited to get some hands on help.  :)"
Rottweiler,3d5hb6,charslo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:23:30 2015 UTC,"haha i'm sure it will. usually does from what i've seen anyways =)  trial and error for sure, sounds like you guys are on the right track anyways! she looks fantastic! definitely a good idea about heading to a show. you can always ask the handlers that are there as well, some are nicer than others lol   one little thing for the feet placing. some people use pegs  to help the dog get used to putting their feet in certain locations for free stacking... maybe not so easy with a puppy, but in the future something to look at.   for the free stacking, maybe get her used to you signalling which of her paws you want her to move by your foot. sort of hard to explain, but if you stand in front you can nudge her with your knees to get either of her front feet moved into position and use your toe to sort of hit the ground to signal her moving her rear paws... if that makes any sense. helps for when you do down and backs and the judge does their little walk arounds (i also sent the pic to my mom and asked if she has any thoughts, just cause.. she's the current show-er and i'm... hanging out with my cat lol!)"
Rottweiler,3d5hb6,charslo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:47:26 2015 UTC,"Awesome thank you!  Yeah I have seen handlers signal with their bodies rather than verbal commands-I just feel totally lost on how that works.  Hopefully that will be something they'll help me with at the class.  Haha!  Thanks so much for your help.  I'm not super worried about her doing well, just want to have fun with her, although I'm sure Wendi(the breeder would like her to do well, haha!)  Her daddy is one of the breeder's favorites so she has a soft spot for her.  She kept her brother and kept telling me it was not easy to send me Mavis either.  Haha!"

Rottweiler,3d10iu,Modern_Ninja,9,Sun Jul 12 19:58:39 2015 UTC,"We had to put him down. He had severe hip dysplasia with less than 10% coverage on both of his hips. He was in constant pain and he was starting to lash out with aggressive snaps at our other dog. He also dropped about 20 pounds in the past month, despite being fed 8 cups of kibble a day and of course plenty of treats. He dropped to the weight he was when he was 7 months. We just couldn't keep him in that pain. He was the best dog I've ever had."

Rottweiler,3cy466,charslo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:18:18 2015 UTC,"yes and no..  breeders who guarantee 2 years of a healthy dog, in my opinion.. are trying to play god or something. when you sell a puppy at 8-12 weeks... things develop as the puppy ages, such is life. my mom had a puppy who was ""perfectly"" healthy for 4 months. then we started noticing that it wasn't  growing at the rate he should and was essentially, just staying a puppy.  ended up that his insides never developed properly - heart was fine and things typically checked for were fine.. just.. immune deficiencies and  other issues with different internal organs.   yes we go to breeders for a ""healthy"" puppy. we go to breeders so that we know the parents and what sicknesses they have, what their parents died from and so on.   but we also go to breeders to meet the parents, see personalities and see what they look like and what the puppy will look like. i think many people forget to realize that breeders -should- be breeding to improve on the breed standard. there are other reasons. example, greyhounds bred to race, hounds born to smell. they likely don't care about confirmation. they care about great race dog bred to great race dog to create better race dog. sniffers to sniff. so on.   i'm not sure about legalities with regards to selling a ""sickly"" puppy from a ""clean bill of health sale"".. to me.. that's not really a big selling feat and simply is weird as fuck to me. however, if the breeder offers this in a contract, pending how hank turns out... i would think that he's ""owed"" a healthy pup..   in any case, i really hope hank is ok! he's an absolute cutey and is a tough little guy!! please keep us updated"

Rottweiler,3bqfs4,ox_is_our_future,6,Wed Jul 1 08:58:56 2015 UTC,"This is a common misconception.  There should be no difference at all.  The breed is the same and the standard is the same other than the tail being docked here in America.  A German rottweiler should just mean the dog was born in Germany.  I've noticed people will assume any well bred rottweiler is German.  I get asked if my puppy is German constantly, but she looks like any rottie bred by the reputable breeders I've come to know (or at least am familiar with their dogs)."
Rottweiler,3bqfs4,MamaSpiritBear,3,Sat Jul 4 17:04:15 2015 UTC,"completely agree  a breed is a breed and the breed standard dictates what it should and shouldn't look like - although personal preference hugely out ways the standard in many cases.   while i realize that breed standards are geared more towards confirmation rather than working, the standard is still there as (more or less) a guideline what the actual breed should look like. these snub nosed ""siberian"" rotties that are featured in the video, look no different than the backyard breeders of north america - and in my opinion are not benefiting the breed in any way.  what should be noted is because they are purebred dogs, there is line breedings. while a ""german"" rottweiler may sometimes appear different than the common ""american"" rottweiler, this is in all likely hood due to the differences in bloodlines and what each different dogs traits that are bred forward."

Rottweiler,3biagi,AGreen513,2,Mon Jun 29 14:05:06 2015 UTC,"Milo weighs ~53kg/~120 pounds.  His diet is -   Breakfast - A big bowl of home-made yogurt, and a raw/half-boiled/sunny-side-up egg (alternate it everyday). Lunch - 500 grams/1 pound of chicken carcass. Dinner - 1-2 pieces of boiled chicken, rice made with it's broth, 1/4 cup milk on top. I spread olive oil on his food too some days when he gets picky. He also gets slices of fruits and vegetables everyday. He doesn't even sniff packet-ed food at all. He wouldn't even go near his bowl even after cleaning it out. He hates all the brands and flavors, and only eats raw now.   He walks two times a day, though (3 kms in morning and evening), and is very, very, active and runs and jumps around the house all day (not even joking), so probably that's why he's not ""fat""."

Rottweiler,3beeph,liz_lemon_lover,6,Sun Jun 28 13:23:37 2015 UTC,"I just went through this exact same thing with my male pitbull (1 year old) and my male black lab (8 years old) about 3 weeks ago.  I spent thousands on trainers and vet visits.  I ended up having to re-home the puppy.  The pup was never aggressive with any dogs, but he started growling and barking/lunging/snarling at the older guy (dominance grab like you said) any time they were in the same room.  If you do seek help, go to a behaviorist - the ones with medical degrees.. Do NOT waste your time on ""aggression trainers"" - if you get help, get someone with a degree in animal psychology.  It's dangerous to mess around with trainers for both you and the dogs.   Like I said, nothing helped for me in the same situation, and my little guy was put back into a foster home right away, and he's very happy and playful again, as is my older guy.  Sometimes dogs just decide to never get along with a particular guy, and while you can try to make them work, it may never work out."

Rottweiler,3beeph,rollotherottie,2,Sun Jun 28 16:58:47 2015 UTC,I had a similar situation with my dog and my brother's older rottie.  They were only  a year apart in age and grew up together. They were great together until mine hit 1 1/2 years old. Then it started gradually then happened more and more.  Basically it was a fight for dominance.  They were fine together until someone petted one and things like that would trigger it.

Rottweiler,3aa847,rickey55,2,Thu Jun 18 13:34:28 2015 UTC,I had mine neutered around 4 years old.  Not much difference to be honest.

Rottweiler,3aa847,sousnami,0,Thu Jun 18 15:33:02 2015 UTC,I would suggest waiting until a year to allow your pup to grow and develop to full potential prior to getting him fixed.
Rottweiler,3aa847,Tiggymartin,3,Fri Jun 19 13:27:41 2015 UTC,I agree with sous. If you neuter your puppy pre puberty then you will have an under developed dog for the rest of its life.   Also with the females it causes some very serious complications down the road and it robs them of an average 3 years of life.. from 13 years to 1-10  http://www.akcchf.org/news-events/library/articles/rottweilerupdate0410.pdf  So.. It is up to you but do the research heavily first.

Everything came up clean at the vet, so I got him eating a digestive pumpkin/rice mix for a day then have slowly put him on the Blue Buffalo Wilderness Puppy kibble. When he was eating it with the pumpkin he was having solid stool, but as I've reduced the pumpkin it's gone straight back to liquid.  Any recommendations/do I tough it out? I've been told by a friend ""in a week he'll adjust"", but I've read from multiple sources online you don't want to go past 3 days of diarrhea so I'm worried..."
Rottweiler,39vvcp,MamaSpiritBear,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:45:24 2015 UTC,"My older girl had the same issue as a puppy, along with thinning hair around her eyes.  I talked to my vet and we ended up doing a blood test to check on any allergies.  She is allergic to eggs, poultry, barley and Brewers yeast.  It took a while to find a decent food with none of those ingredients, but eventually found Canidae lamb and rice and it took care of the problem.  She's been on it ever since.  The vet didn't actually recommend the test-just mentioned allergies as a possibility and I decided I wanted the test.  I'd rather know for sure than keep trying different things for who knows how long.  We may have gotten lucky figuring it out so quickly that way, but it's something to ask your vet about anyway."
Rottweiler,39vvcp,mudo2000,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:07:07 2015 UTC,ProPlan is good stuff. You also need to change slowly; mix some old food with the new and phase it out over a week.
Rottweiler,39vvcp,EnchantedOcelot,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:30:27 2015 UTC,you're supposed to slowly change food. mix a little bit of new food with old food and keep adding a bit more each time until he's 100% on new food.
Rottweiler,39vvcp,codewarrior2007,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:41:09 2015 UTC,"Yes gradually mix from old to new.  I heard that you can put a raw egg in the food to make him want to eat, but that doesn't work on my boy."
Rottweiler,39vvcp,Tiggymartin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:44:40 2015 UTC,I know this is an old post but I hope you get this as this is the answer.  Any time your puppy gets a sore tummy and gets liquid poops the best quickest and safest way to fix them back up is to make them rice and mix in some bland cooked ground beef.  He will eat it all up like it was a treat and as it is one of the most gentle and easy to digest diets on the planet he will get nice solid poops soon after. THEN you can start putting him back on his regular food.  Remember this and use it all his life :) It is a godsend

Rottweiler,39menq,The_Sith_Has_Come,7,Fri Jun 12 19:34:36 2015 UTC,"As /u/SnausageFest said, first they grow up, then out. The females are typically smaller, but can still get pretty ""beefy."" What you're looking for is muscle mass. Toss a toy around with her, making her sprint a little. You'll see her eventually get that ripped chest and legs. To bulk up the neck, play a little tug of war with her. Let her whip the toy around. Some kind of rope toy works best--she can play on her own then.  This is our girl Scarlet at about 1 year. I have her play with heavy toys a lot."

Rottweiler,39menq,MamaSpiritBear,11,Fri Jun 12 22:19:08 2015 UTC,"She looks great!  Try not to compare to others, for one thing a female should look like a female, not a big beefy male.  For another a lot of the ones you'll see around are just plain too big.  The standard says they are a ""medium large breed"".  Finally-a lot of young ones go through a lanky stage and fill out some later on."

Rottweiler,39menq,MamaSpiritBear,3,Fri Jun 12 21:45:37 2015 UTC,"I think you may have taken my comment out of context.  I was telling him his girl looks great and not to worry if she's not as bulky as other rotties he sees.  The obese dog comment was just about a lot of rotties I see.  In my other comment above, you'll see I specifically say that a bulky rottie isn't wrong-it's just that they aren't as bulky and enormous as the average person thinks they are.  Also-a female that looks like a male IS wrong, technically.  The standard specifically says that a female is distinctly feminine, but (and this is important) without weakness of substance.  So a female should still be strong and sturdy, but clearly not in comparison to a male.  That said-from the picture I don't think your girl looks like a male at all, she's nice looking."

Rottweiler,394830,bluej10013,7,Tue Jun 9 05:49:43 2015 UTC,"We have female Rottweiler that we got from a (not the best) breeder. She has her faults. She is very protective of our property, mostly towards other dogs. She will go crazy if she sees one walk by the house.   She is VERY protective of my wife (who can hold her own) and couldn't care less about me (who couldn't do squat if I ever needed to be protected). But on the other hand, she is absolutely the sweetest dog when it comes to her relationship with my wife. She will cuddle on her lap any chance she gets. And will steal my half of the bed if she goes to bed before me.   http://imgur.com/aaY8uzj  Here is en example of how Juno would spend her entire day if she could."

Rottweiler,394830,Modern_Ninja,7,Tue Jun 9 05:09:47 2015 UTC,"I'm sure other's input may vary but here's my take.  I've had 3 Rotties overall in my life. 1 was a breeder docked tail, 1 was a shelter rescue undocked, and my current one is a Rott/Boxer/Whippet mix.   Overall the breed definitely needs early training and socialization. The biggest issue I've seen is falling back on their training meaning constant upkeep is needed. They're pretty smart creatures and will get bored quickly so training and plenty of toys will be needed.  As far as being aggressive towards people or dogs in a non protective way, it definitely depends on the training you've put in and a lot on your own response to the individual people and dogs. Every time I've introduced a new person or dog to my current dog he is usually looking at me for a response on how to act. Since I usually do it with a toy that can be shared the unease wears off almost immediately.   Now as far as protective aggressiveness I have seen this breed turn it on with very diligent discrimination. Every single one of my Rotties has proven their protective instinct. Max (Rottie 1) jumped at two burglars who had kicked in the door. I was alone at home as a teenager. Geronimo (2) was rescued after Max died unexpectedly. His time to shine came when a homeless man decided to wander onto the property as I was playing with my razor scooter with headphones in. I didn't notice him until he was about 10 yards away about 100 yards inside the property. Geronimo ran into a position between me and the guy. He just wanted some aluminum cans or plastic bottles but still kinda scary. Diesel's (3) time came when a guy was was standing by car in a dark parking lot. He wasn't doing anything but it startled me and he reacted accordingly by letting the guy know he shouldn't have been up against my car in a dark parking lot.  Now as cuddley or loner they are an in betweener. They'll cuddle if you bring them in or snuggle up to them but depending on the mood or temperature they can just leave or reposition themselves. I sleep with Diesel now and he prefers snuggling up with my wife. They definitely have a peculiar way of napping, usually on their backs in a hilarious display. Almost a calling card for the breed. The snoring is almost a constant also.  Oh yeah and as far as pulling you when walking, the training early on will pay off. Whatever method you chose just stick to it and enforce it. Sometimes the little eyebrows and big old brown eyes get to you."
Rottweiler,394830,bazdub,3,Tue Jun 9 05:15:40 2015 UTC,"The snoring is almost a constant also   haha, I think this is almost as important a consideration as the shedding - mine is terrible if she's in the wrong position, and always has been. It was a real shock to discover just how loudly a tiny little puppy could snore when she first came home."
Rottweiler,394830,FoodBeerBikesMusic,2,Tue Jun 9 05:38:22 2015 UTC,The snoring is almost a constant also.   ....better still: snoring and farting at the same time....
Rottweiler,394830,bazdub,4,Tue Jun 9 20:39:05 2015 UTC,"-Currently I live in a house with a yard, and I'm 5 minutes from a dog park. But be honest, if my situation changes ever and I have to live in an apartment, would my dog adapt well?   You'll be alright in an apartment I think. My current girl is a total nutcase energy wise, but as long as she gets walked/run a couple of times a day, she's happy to just kick it inside the rest of the day. I have a yard, but she doesn't spend much time in there (she sure poops out there a lot though).   -I've heard pits aren't the best at loving other animals, even (sometimes) when socialized early. Has anyone here had this problem with Rotties?   Both my rotts have gotten along well with other animals, but they went about it in different ways. My old girl would cuddle up and was really gentle with the cats. My current girl loses her shit when we visit friends/family with cats, but not aggressively; she just wants to play with the weird looking balls of fur (the cats usually aren't too keen on this though!)   -I am a short, petite girl (not a complete weakling though). I know this dog could walk me easily. However, if properly trained, do you think my size should be an issue at all? If your dog is trained well, does he/she ever disobey you or drag you when walking?   You should be okay, particularly if you start her training when she's young. If you don't, you'll probably have a bad time. For various reasons, I had to go back to square one with leash training for my girl when she was about 7.5 months old, and she was a handful. She had no problems dragging my mum whereever she wanted, for example.  There are other options though; on a front pull harness my girl doesn't pull at all (though I don't think these are a replacement for being able to walk on a normal collar). I've heard of similar outcomes with halti style leaders, though I haven't personally tried one of them.   -I don't want my dog to be aggressive, but I want him to be protective of me. Do you find that your dog is protective of you even if you've socialized him/her to be friendly?   My previous girl was super-protective; probably too much so. She had a different upbringing to my current girl, who is about as protective as a wet sock - she just loves to meet new people and play with them. She is only 10 months old so this might change as she matures. Honestly, I much prefer the latter temperament. I don't particularly like the idea of my pet having the protection responsibility, and if it that type of situation ever arose, I think I'd be too busy protecting her for her to have a chance at protecting me!   -Are Rotties into cuddling? I don't need an always by your side dog. But I also don't want a dog that's super aloof.   Both my girls were very cuddly. My previous one thought she was a lap dog even at 100lbs, and my current girl always tries to wiggle into the little spoon spot if she finds me lying down. Only when they're tired though, the rest of the time they've been pretty independent and happy to do their own thing.   -I know they shed. That's cool.   Do you know how bad it can get? Mine's blowing her coat at the moment (stupid dog, it's the middle of winter!). I brush her daily, and still have to vacuum the house every day to stay on top of it. It's worth it though!"
Rottweiler,394830,bazdub,2,Tue Jun 9 04:58:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this is great! Follow up question, how long did it take to train your girls?"
Rottweiler,394830,jourtney,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:08:55 2015 UTC,"My current girl had the basics (sit, stay, down, come, leave it, drop it) down within a month or two of coming home, and she's pretty much perfect at them - providing we're at home without any distractions.  Out in the big wide world though, it's a different story. She's still a puppy with a pretty rotten attention span, and will quite regularly ignore me if something takes her fancy. She's getting better every time we go out, but it's slow going at the moment, and we're about to start some class based training purely so she has the opportunity to learn with lots and lots of distractions. It's to be expected though, I don't really expect her to mature for another 12 months or so if she's like my last rottie."
Rottweiler,394830,Tiggymartin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:36:29 2015 UTC,"When outdoors, use higher value treats! Motivating your puppy to pay closer attention to you through payment. Treats like mozzarella cheese sticks, hotdogs, cooked white meat chicken, cooked turkey bacon, etc -- all cut into tiny little pea-sized pieces. I wouldn't work for you in a really highly distracting environment either if I weren't getting paid really well.  Check out my comment on another users post that is relevent to your issue!"
Rottweiler,394830,Tiggymartin,3,Tue Jun 9 09:22:30 2015 UTC,"I will chime in. I have a 3 year old pure bred rotty girl.  -I would get a puppy from a breeder. This is really only if I get a naturally protective breed because proper early training seems to be most important.  (As did I. I actually bought her when the mom was still pregnant and I stated that the breeder was to leave her tail on and keep her ears natural. They are so adorable with their swishy tails!)  -I would take time off work to train/socialize  (Good idea. remember to slowly go out for a hour or 2 every day so your puppy doesnt develop an attachment where she gets used to you being there 24/7. Would make it hard to go back to work)  -Currently I live in a house with a yard, and I'm 5 minutes from a dog park. But be honest, if my situation changes ever and I have to live in an apartment, would my dog adapt well?  (I live in a apt. Just make sure to bring her on walks and out to the park for an hour each day after work. They will get pooped and want to sleep on your bed or you when they get home)  -I've heard pits aren't the best at loving other animals, even (sometimes) when socialized early. Has anyone here had this problem with Rotties?  (Rotties are extremely protective of their family. This is a breed trait. If the dog is looking at you wrong or another person is giving off anything weird your puppy will bark at them. I find at dog parks she is a giant goofball though as she knows its time for fun. I only ever have issues walking down the road.)  -I am a short, petite girl (not a complete weakling though). I know this dog could walk me easily. However, if properly trained, do you think my size should be an issue at all? If your dog is trained well, does he/she ever disobey you or drag you when walking?  (Never have an issue. You can get a Halty or a training front harness if you want to stop her from being able to pull you but decent training and routine will be enough usually.)  -I don't want my dog to be aggressive, but I want him to be protective of me. Do you find that your dog is protective of you even if you've socialized him/her to be friendly?  (This is a breed that is incredibly protective of their family. You wont be able to train that out and you will find her barking at other dogs or people that come directly at you. You can socialize the heck out of her but if she feels something is off with someone.. you will know.. lol and truth be told. Usually when she barks at someone.. That person yells at us or tries to act tough. I trust her instincts)  -Are Rotties into cuddling? I don't need an always by your side dog. But I also don't want a dog that's super aloof.  (ha ha ha ha.. Expect cuddles galore.. I have NEVER met a rotty that didnt love cuddles. They call it the Rotty lean (They hug you) after all. Plus my girl always seems to sneak into my bed at night for extra hugs)  -I know they shed. That's cool.  Very little. At least for my pure Rotty. Get the furminator and use it sparingly. My cats shed 10x more than my rotty does.  Hope these help!  Baby onyx = https://i.gyazo.com/f3eecd1b020b7506b8e179c324252a31.png  Adult Onyx = https://i.gyazo.com/bad659351c6707eac49cc608e214928f.png  Oh and.. If you get a girl. Dont spay/overectomy her until after her first heat. Google the reasons why but the short skinny is that it causes a hell of a lot of high risk issues to her health in her adult life."
Rottweiler,394830,ShereOnFire,2,Tue Jun 9 16:14:54 2015 UTC,The more all of you talk about your pups the MORE I fall in love with this breed :)
Rottweiler,394830,Tiggymartin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:13:39 2015 UTC,They really are giant cuddle muffins! I love coming home to Onyx being so excited and happy that she knocks herself over from wagging to hard lol.  Wahlz makes a shampoo for black fur dogs that REALLY brings a nice shine to Rotties coats ;) I highly recommend it as well!
Rottweiler,394830,LeaveOfEd,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:30:16 2015 UTC,Curiously how long does it take you to properly groom your dog with the furminator? And why use it sparingly?   Onyx  sounds like an awesome dog =)
Rottweiler,394830,LeaveOfEd,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:13:47 2015 UTC,aw thank you :D  It takes me about 20 min to groom Onyx and I do it once a month. Bath time takes about 10 min.  Be sparngly with the Furminator as it removes the puppies under coat. You dont want to remove ALL of her undercoat though or she may get a sunburn and over heat :P  In winter I dont even use it as it will take away a lot of your puppies warm fur. Regular brush in winter. Furminator in Summer.
Rottweiler,394830,fuckinghatecorn,5,Sun Jun 14 17:46:18 2015 UTC,"Not meaning to guilt trip, but please consider adopting. There are a lot of Rott specific rescues out there and a lot of times they can give you info regarding things like other dog/cat aggression, resource guarding, and possibly offer adoption trials. with the time and effort, almost any dog can be trained. Also, adopting a 1+ year old over a puppy will save you A LOT of stress and money. Here are some pics that show my adopted @ about 1yr old Rottie, Porterhouse, in a nutshell.  http://imgur.com/zhLYYBJ http://imgur.com/KNjLBO4"
Rottweiler,394830,reybrujo47,3,Tue Jun 9 05:18:15 2015 UTC,I'll definitely research further. It just makes me nervous to start training when they're already big and strong. But I guess I should trust the organization to pair me with a non-aggressive personality.
Rottweiler,394830,miamiis,2,Tue Jun 9 05:26:47 2015 UTC,"Completely understandable. I found having the time to assess each pup's personality a huge benefit.  Thanks for considering adoption, op!"
Rottweiler,394830,FoodBeerBikesMusic,2,Tue Jun 9 05:37:47 2015 UTC,"my dog is really friendly with people, but got attacked heaps at the dog park cause of his size mainly by smaller dogs, so now I cant have him around other dogs, but other than that, he does everything I say, is a big softie. he jumps up an give me a hug like a human every morning"
Rottweiler,394830,thelim3y,2,Tue Jun 9 10:31:54 2015 UTC,"My family and I are enjoying our third Rottweiler in our home.  Our first pair were litter mates obtained from a local Amish breeder.  Both grew very large compared to the breed standard.  They were reasonably protective of our property, they could be walked on and off lead without difficulty. They were tolerant of small children and animals.  The alpha preferred to be around my wife.  Otherwise, he was content with a quiet spot nearby.  We have a very large fenced yard he would patrol the inner perimeter for exercise while his brother watched him from the deck.    Exercise is important.   Bored Rotties can be destructive.   Curious young boys eliminated several young trees on our property.  However, given enough walking and exercise they can be comfortable in a small home or apartment.   Rottweilers are people dogs.  They want to be near you and included in your activities.   Rotties shed.  IMO, less than other breeds.  Proactive brushing can reduce the post winter undercoat.    I suggest early training and socialization. Reward positive behavior.    Our current Rottie is a rescue.  He'd been staked out in a suburban backyard for his first eight months.  We brought him home a ten months weighing about sixty lbs. His ribs were visible.  His coat was dull and he had kennel cough. Eight years later he's a ""special"" member of the family. I won't trust him off lead.  His curiosity and protective instinct have almost gotten him into trouble.  Fortunately, verbal commands prevented serious trouble.   He does not like horses.  We don't allow him unsupervised reign without a tethered lead.    Generally speaking, happy well socialized Rotties can be delightful clowns. Some like to cuddle and snuggle.  Like people, others may not like to cuddle much.  They do tend to prefer one person to others.  They are prone to  be defensive and territorial.  Rotties may attempt to assert dominance by claiming your portion of the bed, sofa or your favorite chair.  Gently, but firmly assert dominance.  The same goes with pulling the lead while walking.   If your willing to put the time in to develop a relationship with your new family member, a Rottweiler may be a good fit for you."
Rottweiler,394830,IamRoyalty,2,Tue Jun 9 11:48:07 2015 UTC,"They are sweet, cuddly, smart, and protective.  You just need time to walk, brush, and play.  Other than that they are easy to care for and low maintenance.  Consider adopting a dog (not puppy) that is already housebroken/trained to save you lots of time and effort."
Rottweiler,394830,IamRoyalty,2,Tue Jun 9 14:45:49 2015 UTC,"I am currently on #2 and #3 Rotties. This has been my experience:  They are very energetic. They need plenty of exercise and mental stimulation. If they don't get regular exercise and/or get bored, you're gonna' have a hard time. They will amuse themselves and how they choose to do so may not be to your liking. They were bred as working dogs and as such, are happiest when they have a ""job"" - whatever that job might be, they will do it 100%. My male is the reason I started running (join us over at /r/runningwithdogs ) and he absolutely loves it.  As far as an apartment dog, they would be ...ok... but you really need to keep up with their exercise requirements.  Training and socialization is essential....and must be ongoing. They are adaptable to almost any situation, but proper acclimation is key. The more places you take them and they are comfortable in, the more places they can go!  Our first Rottie was fine with other animals (except rodents). #2 has always been fairly belligerent with other dogs. Because of that, we haven't had #3 around other dogs much and he seems a bit aggressive towards them. All of them have been fine with our cats - although they did feel the need to ""referee"" when the cats got to beating each other up...  I wouldn't worry about your dog being protective. Aggression towards people has never been tolerated with any of our three. They sound like they're going to murder you, if you come to the house when we're not home, but are happy to see you, when we are. They've all been really great with people - yet each of them has shown protective instincts in sketchy situations, when it was appropriate. You want a dog that knows the difference. It's been my experience that their instincts are spot on.  Leash manners are trainable, but even so, some dogs are more predisposed to being better at it. We never really trained the male, and yet, he's a joy to walk. The female is a pain in the ass.  Are Rotties into cuddling? Hahahahahahahaha. We have a 110b lap dog who's happiest on the bed or couch with us. The female less so."
Rottweiler,394830,NuckinBanana,2,Tue Jun 9 21:41:56 2015 UTC,"I've had 2 females and a male. The male was more loving/cuddly. Most loyal, sweet, loving dogs I could have ever hoped for...  They don't just need training. They need a leader so be prepared to be that. I found a stern 'No' and lots of praise worked better e.g. Don't over do the negativity but ensure the dog knows something is wrong yet overdo the praise.Training with treats works very well with these dogs. Mine is voice commanded at this point, no leash required.  Socialize frequently from day 1 and don't stop."
Rottweiler,394830,big84,2,Wed Jun 10 00:24:13 2015 UTC,"I am also a young woman with a rottie, so I feel my input might be helpful.  My parents bought my girl at a reputable breeder as an 8 week old pup. I immediately started her in hardcore training (twice a week through ""level 3"" or Canine Good Citizen level). She loved it, ate it up, and was the youngest and best behaved in every class.  Merit doesn't require tons of exercise. She's a docile, sweet lady. She loves stuffed animals and tug of war, and likes to play for about 10 minutes a day and sniff around outside for about half an hour. She likes to be alone for her potty breaks.  The most important thing to know about rotts from my perspective is that they are one person dogs. Merit cuddles me and protects me and is very obviously attached to me. She likes other people, but she loves me. She doesn't often listen or obey my boyfriend, my parents, or my brothers when they are around. She is very aware of my emotions and feelings and gets upset at people when they upset me. She's even woofed (the most barking she ever makes unless there's actual danger) at my boyfriend if he says something that hurts my feelings.  She is very social and has never had a problem getting along with any animal. She seems a bit afraid and intrigued by cats, and wants to play constantly with other dogs.   The only issues I've had as a college aged Rott owner were solved by presenting insurance and CGC paperwork. Merit has a vest and is service trained as a companion dog - not hard to do, btw. Find a great training school that offers CGC as part of their cirriculum. We live in an apartment as of August and I'm not the least bit worried she won't be fine in the apartment.   They are great dogs, and as a woman living alone, she gives me a lot of confidence that I'm safe. She loves to be close but doesn't need constant attention, which is exactly what I need in my college companion. They're wonderful, and I look forward to seeing pics of your sweet puppy on this sub soon!"
Rottweiler,394830,4Stroke,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:49:26 2015 UTC,:) Your dog sounds awesome. Was it hard fining an apartment that didn't ban rotties outright?
Rottweiler,394830,4Stroke,2,Tue Jun 16 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"Because she's a service dog, it's outright illegal to disallow her.  However, I have only even toured one apartment that didn't allow rotts. The apartment I toured said if I did want her to live with me I'd need to register her with the city (I live in oklahoma) to basically say she was not agressive."
Rottweiler,394830,kebertt,4,Wed Jun 17 02:12:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about the breed, I am subscribed to the subreddit because they are beautiful dogs, but I hope you get some answers because you pose some great questions! Good luck."
Rottweiler,394830,kebertt,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:44:36 2015 UTC,"I had a rottie for 3 years. He came to me about 1.5y/o and had the softest temperament of any dog I've ever known. He barely ever barked and was amazing around all other dogs. We had a garden at first and walked twice a day, then our situation changed and moved into an inner city apartment. I had to be very regimented living with him there because the poor guy couldn't just get up and pee in the middle of the night like we could. Had to take him for a couple mile walk first thing in the morning and as soon as I was home from work. Then a quick pop round the block before bed.   That aside, he was my best bud. We walked off leash a lot and he never left my side, was perfect at reading my commands and would bolt back to me from 300m away after hearing our custom whistle.   As long as you treat it right and put in the time a big 50kg dog needs, you'll have a new best bud and won't ever regret taking one on."

Rottweiler,3921ec,MamaSpiritBear,6,Mon Jun 8 18:03:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Right up there with this is the trend towards overly beefy dogs. Rotties aren't supposed to be 150+ lbs. 130 is considered the high end of acceptable for males, 90 for females. My girl was overweight at 90 (she's a healthy 80 now) and I had several people telling me she seemed small for a Rottweiler. It was aggravating."
Rottweiler,3921ec,theberg512,5,Tue Jun 9 00:16:43 2015 UTC,"Ha my vet wanted my male to be around 90 because he has bad knees.     I think people have a misconception of how big Rottweilers really are.  The media portrays them as these giant beasts, when in reality they're supposed to be the size of a golden retriever.   My dog is considered tall for a rotty, and he's very lean at about 110-115 at his heaviest.   I get all the time that he's small for a Rottweiler."

Rottweiler,38egmd,rollotherottie,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:42:13 2015 UTC,"You have a couple things going on here, I think.  I'm not a trainer, but I've been around dogs a long time and have read a lot of books and been to various training courses on them.  (Hey, we have Rotties, we have to have good examples of the breed to off-set all the negativity)  First, I'd say that your dog is fear aggressive in the situation you described.  She clearly wasn't comfortable being around the kids, was anxious and on-leash.  That's not a good situation for meeting new people.  Secondly, on the resource guarding, that's fairly common as well.  There are plenty of ways to help your dog get over it.  Take a look at /r/dogtraining, there are a ton of resources there.  Take heart, as well.  This is not anything you can't overcome.  She's young still, and probably doesn't have a lot of confidence.  You can help her with this.  A couple resources for you:  BAT (Behavior Adjustment Training) http://www.training-your-dog-and-you.com/Behavior_Adjustment_Training.html  Resource guarding and various other good places to start:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/onlineresources  Hope this helps!"

But he has snapped at me when I've tried to take something away from him. He was snarling and showing his teeth at a much larger German Shepard at the dog park yesterday (it was his first time at the park so that might have something to do with it). Your right though, it is very concerning."

Rottweiler,37vxnm,Angry_Caveman_Lawyer,2,Sun May 31 03:17:10 2015 UTC,"Adding on to this for OP.  Don't 'baby' her. As soon as the doctor recommends he/she start walking, do it.  He/She will limp and maybe be a big rottie baby, but follow the doctors instructions.  I had a rottie who ended up tearing both ACLs and the worst thing we did was baby her and not get her walking sooner.  Extended the recovery time."

Rottweiler,37vxnm,Horatio_Hornblows,3,Sun May 31 02:12:31 2015 UTC,I'm trying to decide if I should do this for my boy. He's 7 1/2.  I'm worried about the recovery and keeping him from damaging his leg.  Let me know how it goes. I need to decide in the next few weeks
Rottweiler,37vxnm,rollotherottie,2,Sun May 31 17:42:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the recovery sounds pretty intense.  Mine's 2 1/2 and the vet says 90-100% recovery.   I will definitely give you an up date at the end of the week.  My vet gave me a link for after care, but there is a ton of info on the website.  Might help you to decide if the surgery is right for your boy."
Rottweiler,37vxnm,Horatio_Hornblows,2,Sun May 31 21:51:03 2015 UTC,"My boy had his surgery on Thursday.  He was out of commission most of Thursday evening but experienced a lot of pain during the night.  I had pain killers for him that the vet gave me, so he was back to sleep within 1/2 an hour.  I ended up sleeping on the kitchen floor with him that night.  Think I woke up in worse shape than Stan.  The incision is approx 12 inches long and has about 25 staples.  It looks clean with a minimal amount of bruising around the incision.  There has been a bit of clear/pinkish liquid that seeped on the first night, but the vet assured me that this is normal.  I just gently clean the area with a warm clean cloth.  Have been massaging and doing range of motion exercises as per instructions from vet.  Icing the area afterwards.    There is no way to avoid stairs in our house.  The vet loaned us a harness that wraps under his belly and there are suitcase handles that you can hold to support his back end.  This works well for maneuvering the stairs in and out of the house.  Stan is eating normally, albeit about half as much as normal but his energy output has diminished so he doesn't need his normal serving.  My only concern so far is that he has yet to have a bowel movement.  Not sure he can get enough leverage on his back end to push one out.  Lots of gas (from meds, I think), but no solid.  Wondering if we need to spend some time in the yard with the harness so he can get enough support to do his business.  TMI, maybe?  I spoke to a lady who had a 10 y/o golden with same surgery.  Her dog was not recovering well.  She felt it was due to age because the animal had the first leg done when it was 3-4 and recovered 100%.  I would say if your boy is strong and healthy (except for his knee, of course), the surgery would be best done ASAP while he is young enough to recover fully.  Rating:  10/10 - don't want to do again, but would if we have to."
Rottweiler,37vxnm,Horatio_Hornblows,3,Sat Jun 6 17:54:32 2015 UTC,Thank You so much for the information.  I'll have to decide in the next few weeks. I'm getting a second opinion on Friday and then decide. My biggest fear is making things worse for my boy.
Rottweiler,37vxnm,rollotherottie,2,Sun Jun 7 00:38:02 2015 UTC,No problem.  I will let you know if we experience any complications in the next couple  of weeks.    Good luck! :)
Rottweiler,37vxnm,Horatio_Hornblows,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:52:59 2015 UTC,"So far it's going pretty well. The recovery is 8 weeks, it's going to be hard to keep her from moving around as much as she wants. I hope whatever you do, your rottie is okay!"
Rottweiler,37vxnm,Horatio_Hornblows,2,Sun May 31 20:15:05 2015 UTC,"She did have surgery. So far it's been alright, she wants to move a lot more than she's allowed and keeps trying to move the cast (typical rottweiler contrarianism). The worst part is she cries when my mom and dad go to bed upstairs since she can't climb stairs right now, so one of them has to sleep downstairs with her"

Stairs are a problem at my house too...I'm a bit worried about that.  From what I've been told, the after care is extremely important.  My vet directed me to this website for info.  I have already started practicing massage on him to get him used to it for after surgery.  Best of luck on your pooches recovery!!"
Rottweiler,37vxnm,holpuch09,3,Sun May 31 21:47:26 2015 UTC,"We used a ""rear end lift"" for my girl when she tore hers and it was time to start getting her up and down the stairs some.

Now that he is older I wouldn't consider a backyard a definite need. He is super lazy and would rather be inside than out. In all, I wouldn't recommend getting any kind of puppy in an apartment unless you are on the first floor right next to some grass/potty area. But if you think you won't mind, then a Rott's energy level would be fine for an apartment, with regular walks."
Rottweiler,37src1,XandraBeetle,2,Sat May 30 03:25:38 2015 UTC,"I have raised puppies in buildings. Get pee and poop pads, put a patch of grass or fake grass on your balcony and bring the puppy out there a lot to potty. When they get a little bigger and they start to let you know when its time to go out then you can just bring them out.  Best part of being in a building is your dog will get ultra socialised very quickly from constantly seeing people and being cuddled. Encourage this. See my puppy? hug her!*  Rotties are a breed thet are ultra protective of their pack so unless you socialise them very early and kep it up she will be barking at everyone she sees that goes near you 2.  So year In a apt. Get a puppy and socialise them :P  Also park for an hour a day.  Pet screen for your balcony so he/she can go rest out there and enjoy the view/grass.  Also.. the breed is notorious for loving pillows. Your bed may become hers lol"

They were all very good with guests and family members, and usually greeted them more enthusiastically than my husband!  We have a large back yard, but we ended up taking them for walks, to the dog park or doggie day care to tire them out.  The yard is not a fix for their needs. Our big male was dog-aggressive so we walked at least three miles a day, every day of his life.   We've not had problems with our females, both were/are good at the dog park and our latest absolutely loves doggie day care.   I don't think a yard is necessary except for late-night bathroom breaks!"

We are at a loss with our 4 year old female. She has jumped out the window or snuck out the door several times to go after other dogs (A husky 3 times at our old house and a St. Bernard twice at our current house). Even worse, we are pretty sure she was the one who attacked our chihuahua. I'd love to find a fix since at this point, we are really close to letting her go."

Someone who is prejudiced against rottweilers and their owners will have a negative stereotype already in mind, and an owner that has a lunging, uncontrolled dog and who tells people to fuck off when they are questioned falls pretty neatly into that stereotype.   I have to say the assertion that ""people like that won't change"" is obviously nonsense. Lots of people have a fear of dogs or of certain breeds and get over it."

Sure they look intimidating, but I feel rotties' reputation is totally unwarranted.  There is ample evidence that smaller dogs are much more aggressive."
Rottweiler,371uq6,ciaran668,8,Sun May 24 05:07:52 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately,  there is a lot of dislike for Rotties thanks too media and movies.   Worse,  because of the false perception of them,  even innocent behavior is considered aggressiveness.   And God forbid another dog attacks yours, because even though the other dog started it,  tips tales the blame.   That said,  socialize the dog to the point that nothing phases or excites it.   If you can get the dog to roll over and ask for belly rubs, that is the best.  Stick a really adorable bandana on it,  maybe a T shirt.   I know it sounds silly,  but anything you and do to make it adorable,  the easier it will be.   When I started doing that,  I noticed at least some people responding more favorably to him."
Rottweiler,371uq6,ThePurpleParrots,3,Sun May 24 05:17:34 2015 UTC,I have her decked out in a pink harness and neon pink flowered collar. I'll try a bandanna maybe that would work I like the idea!

It looked so absurd, but it was very difficult for people to be afraid of a dog with a giant flower on it's head.  Also I think people tend to be more afraid of dogs in harnesses as opposed to a normal collar.  I think they see the harness and equate it to meaning the dog is in need of greater control."
Rottweiler,371uq6,RemedyofNorway,6,Sun May 24 03:34:16 2015 UTC,"When I walk my rottis i have people literally crossing the road to avoid us.  Even when we are in the dog park people will not come in.  And, unfortunately we get abuse and once even screaming fits of terror - when we were just walking.  That being said my female loves her ball.  She now carries it everywhere and it seems to have become an ice breaker with people.   Now a lot of people are recognising her brightly coloured ball and are starting up conversations with me and not avoiding us.  You will always, unfortunately,  get the absolutely terrified rotti haters but at the end of the day its their loss for not knowing one of the best breeds of dogs around.  To cut a long story short maybe try to ""cutify"" your rotti somehow to show how wonderful he/she is.  Try to gwt plenty of socialisation as you can for your dog and yourself as well."

Rottweiler,371uq6,holpuch09,4,Sun May 24 07:02:43 2015 UTC,"Don`t let idiots get you down, they have no understanding of the breed probably could not even tell the difference between an aggressive dog or a playful one.   My dog usually walks well on a leash, but once he is close to another dog he usually wants to greet and will pull inappropriately. This is of course annoying and gives others a bad impression.   I have no miracle cure for this, but what i try to do is to stop walking if he pulls or moves ahead of me and will not move until he is sitting on heels again. Attention is the hard thing to get from my dog so i often have to tug hard on the leash and verbally remind him what to do if he wants to go forward. The best way would be to have something reeeeaallly tasty snacks to reward him, but i am too lazy to bring it on minor trips.  My dogs priorities are  =  tasty snax > other dogs close by > me without snax. As you can see, in my dogs case the best thing is to up the anti with something he wants more than to sniff butt.  If unsuccessful or i feel he is consistently disobedient and testing me i put him on his side and have a couple of minutes with quality time out. This is difficult to start with on a rottweiler but now he knows the routine and will go in time out on verbal command."
Rottweiler,371uq6,holpuch09,2,Sun May 24 04:32:50 2015 UTC,"Like to show support as I dont have much tips to give. If people asks me I will reply with a smile and if someone shouts at me I walk away or shout back, depending on mood. (im assuming they like to be addressed that way). I have bandannas and it works. People hardly notice that they are rotts anymore. Well.good thing is they are easy to train. Keep working the leash :)"
Rottweiler,371uq6,JakeSaint,1 point,Sun May 24 05:03:13 2015 UTC,"I think I'm going to stock up in bandannas. Whenever people are aggressive towards us on the street I do not respond.

Rottweiler,371uq6,th3cabl3guy,2,Sun May 24 07:43:41 2015 UTC,"I've found that a few things are important when having our rotties out:    if you're nervous about a situation, your dog is more likely to respond in a more excited/anxious way, which can make things worse for everyone. if a person you're approaching is nervous, see #1.  People wearing clothing that covers/obscures their faces will also cause higher anxiety in the dog, especially as rotties are naturally protective.  smile at people who you are approaching. You looking easy-going will go a long way to diffuse the situation. Generally have open and carefree body language (arms open, shoulders relaxed, etc). This was difficult for me at first, but I've found that the ""fake it till you make it"" method works wonders for keeping me calm (and in turn our rotties) when dealing with other people. This includes people that tell you mean things. Continue to be carefree/happy seeming and just brush off their comments. Talk about how your dog is a loveable teddy bear, because that's what they are.  try not to take your dog out where there are a lot of people until she is already well-exercised; it will give you an opportunity to work on it, and there will be less chance of an issue don't discourage people from touching your dog unless you know she has an issue with this. You're a ""brand"" ambassador for all rotties. Along those lines, you should never be the one to cross the street away from people you're approaching. You'll likely make the person/people feel as though your dog is dangerous or hard to control because of your behavior.    tl;dr: you're an ambassador for rottweilers, and so is your dog. Rotties make you happy so show that to the world.   EDIT: formatting"
Rottweiler,371uq6,kaydunlap,1 point,Sun May 24 11:41:10 2015 UTC,"Very good points! I've worked with a trainer on my body language actually, and I try very hard to be open and easy-going when walking my dog. I feel like I am continually improving over time. I also avoid areas with lots of people, it's easier that way. My husband walks her mostly and he is always coming home saying how she met nice people in the park and made friends with them. We try our hardest to be good rottie ambassadors!"
Rottweiler,371uq6,kaydunlap,2,Sun May 24 18:35:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know what you mean. We have two boys that are almost 1.5 years now and I've found that it's easier for me (as I had an ACL reconstruction about 5 months ago) to steer clear of people and the extra excitement, but when the hubby takes them out I always hear about their new friends and how many licks they give to everyone!"
Rottweiler,371uq6,th3cabl3guy,2,Sun May 24 20:36:33 2015 UTC,"My Diamond is very, very well behaved on the leash in almost all circumstances. The exception to this rule is when there's a dog who even LOOKS at her.   Then she goes apeshit. She gets insanely playful and just wants to have fun. Despite that, people are assholes and start getting snarky when they see her.   My usual response? ""Go fuck yourself.""  I've got no patience for people who're gonna be judgemental of a breed instead of the dog itself.   This is Diamond, btw.   Another one for grins!"
Rottweiler,371uq6,kaydunlap,2,Sun May 24 20:53:50 2015 UTC,"When I first got tiger I had the same issues with walking on a leash.   Try using a choke collar and a short leash instead of a harness.   Make sure the choke collar is snug and more towards the upper part of the neck.  The collar is used to break the dogs attention, not strangle.  If you have the short leash you keep the dog by your side and it's easier to assert that your leading the walk.  When you notice your dog is getting antsy, give her a quick snap and tell her no.  It's every dogs instinct to get excited to see another dog, except your dogs 100lbs and people are ignorant.    http://m.petsmart.com/h5/hub?id=supplies-training%2Fcollars%2Ftop-paw-training-dog-collar-zid36-8794%2Fcat-36-catid-100081%3Fvar_id%3D36-8794 http://m.petsmart.com/h5/hub?isSearching=true&SearchTerm=short+leash"

When he sat then I would then give him attention and say good boy. I was consistent with that and now he's good. Although on a few rare occasions he may jump I just keep at it. They're smart dogs.
Rottweiler,3729cm,SoHiep,3,Sun May 24 06:55:12 2015 UTC,"I taught mine not to do that with a loud ""ouch"" or ""owww"" and in time they stopped.  After three rottweilers, I've found they all do it to some extent and grow out of it.  But ""owww"" really loudly and consistently should work well."

Rottweiler,35jcxz,fluffykittensandshit,4,Sun May 10 23:01:55 2015 UTC,"See a vet or a trainer. Dogs learn how to interact when they are young- you want to start him off right! Big dogs like Rotts are still going through adolescence at this age. Don't alpha role him or assert your dominance- that's an old training method that been disproved by professionals. People who train working dogs like K-9s, search and rescue, bomb dogs and guide dogs all show to have much more reliable animals with positive reinforcement than domination. Here's a short article with some debunked behavior myths- http://m.lancasteronline.com/lifestyle/animal-behavior-expert-debunks-dog-myths/article_6deace02-d47c-11e3-a581-0017a43b2370.html?mode=jqm"
Rottweiler,35jcxz,jwolf185,1 point,Mon May 11 04:03:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks. He has been in with a trainer and we use positive reinforcement training unless he is just being a lunkhead. Then I get stern and he doesn't like it. He calms down, sits, and looks at me like I'm sorry momma. I'm thinking he is probably fine and his human needs some additional training."
Rottweiler,35jcxz,Drox1,0,Mon May 11 12:06:59 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it makes a difference or not but has something changed in your household?  Shift in power so to speak.  Dogs need to either be the Alpha or have an Alpha over them.  My best guess without knowing anything other than what you posted is no one is taking that Alpha position over him and he is grabbing for the throne.  My suggestion is to reassert your dominance over him every chance you get.  Make him wait to enter the door until after you and the other dogs go through,  make him wait to eat his food, make him heel when waking, etc."

One of my favourite things about my Rott X Kelpie is how terrifying his bark & growl is. He's a big baby softy but you'd nope it out quick smart if he was barking at you. Give your dogs a big cuddle for me."
Rottweiler,35cxk8,chef2b90,4,Sat May 9 02:38:50 2015 UTC,why would that even be an issue? Of course your dog should be inside during a storm.
Rottweiler,35cxk8,bharas,1 point,Sat May 9 19:06:52 2015 UTC,Oh so not an issue. We are more than happy to bring her in. In fact she's a 70lb lap dog because she's inside so often. The only time she and our aussie are outside is when we aren't home.
Rottweiler,35cxk8,Tiggymartin,2,Sun May 10 03:35:28 2015 UTC,"hmmm. One of the questions when we adopted out puppy was ""Is this going to be an indoor dog or will it be an outdoor dog"" If you said outdoor you were denied the puppy.  They then tried to trick us by asking if the dig would have a dog hous. If yes then They would deny us.  I thought it was just local but I started watching the animal shelter shows on Netflix and learned they consider it a critical failure of a dog owner to leave the dog outside unattended for long periods of time.  Interesting stuff.  Then again.. My dog has her own bedroom with her own bed and little furniture so I may be a little nutty lol"
Rottweiler,35bspl,Southpawpierce,4,Fri May 8 20:18:24 2015 UTC,Sorry for your loss.  I had to do the same back in December to my fantastic rottie mix Dagny.

Rottweiler,35d3nk,Cleev,1 point,Sat May 9 03:46:34 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of troubles training my Rottie to use the restroom outside rather than the inside. He would continually go to an unused room in the house and pee. My dog trainer advised me to always keep them within sight. If you catch them in the act of peeing or popping, clap loudly to startle, but not enough to scare them. They'll stop and you can carry them outside into the grass to continue their business. It took a bit, but this really worked for me. I just had to watch him at all times and if I noticed him circling or pacing, take him out in case. Once they start going outside, it's super easy. My dog trainer recommended putting plates of food on spots in the house where they frequently use the restroom as they wont urinate where they eat."

Rottweiler,353h5u,holpuch09,1 point,Wed May 6 20:07:18 2015 UTC,"aw don't be so down on the guy. hips vary per dog, same goes for any other aspects.   he's still a pup and if anything, he's likely got more brains than your other guy ;) just showing off his larger than life personality. make it a great big game for him, for both of them (even if the other guy knows what you're requesting of him). he's likely bored out of his mind and home and needs more stimulation.   but for the recall, game it up. have lots of treats and make it an over the top happy experience when he comes to you. then start asking him to sit when he comes and whatever else you may want."
Rottweiler,353h5u,charslo,1 point,Wed May 6 22:29:23 2015 UTC,Yeah I realized after I posted that it sounded horrible... But he really does act like he has Aspberger's (best way I could think to describe it).   I will have to see if he reacts more with the fun-ness as he generally doesn't respond to treats. I know they need lots of mental stimulation too and maybe that's the problem here?
Rottweiler,353h5u,charslo,1 point,Thu May 7 07:26:19 2015 UTC,"lol i didn't mean for it to make you feel bad. he could have some sort of disability, it's hard to say. if you are truly worried about that aspect of his health, you can always talk to your vet about his behavior.  i would try a few different things. if he's just wondering around whimpering and what not, he could just be bored. some dogs simply don't like it inside as well? i've seen a few suggestions with regards to entertaining things, most revolve around food though. maybe find something he loves and integrate it into some of the suggestions?  frozen kong with peanut butter, a bunch (3 or 4) of 2L bottles with kibble swiveling so the dog hits it to get the food out. maybe just google bored dog ideas and see what comes up. you could also try getting him into something like agility, obedience or tracking and seeing how he does with that."

We trained him to stay within our property, but if he strays too far, he will get a small shock (It is set on the lowest setting), and he will return to our property.  It really gives him a sense of freedom, and he enjoys being able to see everything around him."

Rottweiler,34teab,liz_lemon_lover,2,Mon May 4 12:18:22 2015 UTC,Any special reason they were recommended or just as a chewy?
Rottweiler,34teab,motherofkatana,2,Tue May 5 00:48:44 2015 UTC,Well the vet recommended them as whole bones opposed to butchers chopping them up into smaller pieces. I guess they have the right amount of meat on them - not too much or too little. We were also told to throw out bones within a day or two. We're going to stick to rawhide though in the future because my dog generally  refuses to eat his bone unless it's inside and in our company. The amount of times I shoo'd him off the couch and rug yesterday was too frustrating. If we lock him out with it he sits at the door crying to come back in. Silly pup.
Rottweiler,34teab,reybrujo47,3,Tue May 5 01:34:07 2015 UTC,Rottie are very family oriented.  They want to be with you.  The cow femurs could work if you can spend outside time together.   Please make sure to provide shade and water too.
Rottweiler,34teab,reybrujo47,2,Tue May 5 03:15:02 2015 UTC,I think it's adorable that he chooses us over his food. He spends the majority of his time inside with us. I tried sitting with him for a bit outside to encourage him to eat it out there but I did get quite bored. We've decided we'll give him his next one when we're planning on going out for a bit. He only gets upset if he knows we're inside without him and because he's an inside dog that's pretty rare.

Rottweiler,343fiv,cstxRottOwner,6,Tue Apr 28 00:14:31 2015 UTC,He may be a few pounds light but he has plenty of years left to add those pounds
Rottweiler,343fiv,charslo,3,Tue Apr 28 00:17:11 2015 UTC,"he looks good! you can't see his ribs, but i'm guessing you can feel them. it's a good weight!"
Rottweiler,343fiv,charslo,2,Tue Apr 28 00:24:29 2015 UTC,You can see them sometimes but they definitely don't stick out which is what I obviously would prefer over him being too heavy
Rottweiler,343fiv,ARedHouseOverYonder,3,Tue Apr 28 00:34:11 2015 UTC,"oh definitely!   over the past few years, our rotties average around 100lbs. i don't believe this new fad of 'big heavy"" rotties is healthy.  your guy looks a bit taller, so once he hits 3 and bulks up, he might hit around 105-110 but i don't see him going any further than that at all."
Rottweiler,343fiv,ARedHouseOverYonder,3,Tue Apr 28 03:44:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly, this giant head monster breed isnt particularly good for them and their long term health.   The OP's dog looks GREAT. That will save so much money on joint health in the long run anyway."

Rottweiler,33x47j,theghostofkurtcobain,2,Sun Apr 26 19:00:19 2015 UTC,Make sure you throw them in and show them how to get to the steps and get out so that if they ever fall in they don't just swim in a circle until they drown.  Repeat a couple of times until you feel they know the deal.
Rottweiler,33x47j,El_Gringo_Libre,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:23:31 2015 UTC,I carry him in. He's only 8 months so I don't want him fearing the water if I throw him in. I've made it a point to show him how to get out if he slips in though.
Rottweiler,33x47j,lawyerlady,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:12:28 2015 UTC,He steps in but hasn't jumped in yet. I carry him in and point him to the steps so he knows how to get out. But it hasn't gotten real hot yet so I'll update later in the summer.

Rottweiler,32xrs9,SprunkMaster,3,Fri Apr 17 16:23:14 2015 UTC,"IMO it depends on what quality food you can afford or are willing to spend on your new buddy, to be blunt. My Hamish is a young 2year old. He eats about 6-8 cups of dry food. This quantity of food puts him at about 110#s. he is lean enough that his serratus anterior muscles are clearly visible when he moves. Rotties are kindof the professional athletes of doggiedom what is put in is what is displayed. you can have a big ol' offensive lineman or big lean middle linebacker. (I have yet to see a skinny wide receiver Rottie) save a year to 18 mos pup."
Rottweiler,32xrs9,lkams,3,Fri Apr 17 16:53:55 2015 UTC,"sorry I didn't mention cost. brand dependent mostly. I spent more when Hamish was a pup on food, I was really focused on his weight and the rate he was putting it on. After having Mastiffs the food intake vs weight increase is a present concern for me in large (read giant) breed dogs. side note IMO the term giant breed is a misnomer since the Molossus line as specific breed is extinct."
Rottweiler,32xrs9,lkams,3,Fri Apr 17 17:00:18 2015 UTC,"My boy is lean since he's fairly inactive at 100 lbs and height maxed; he maxed out at 115 lbs when he was active. We were those people that used to cook for him for his first two years (it'd be rice/meat/veggies mixed into his kibble), and we buy a grain-free freeze-dried rawboost kibble; now he just gets 4 cups/day of kibble (2 feedings at 2 cups) and if it were just him, it takes about a month and a half for him to go through a 25 lb. bag at $60-$90 (depends on whether I buy in store or online; online is cheaper, but then you wait on shipping time)."

I also don't feed him specialized foods because he doesn't seem to need them.  My guy is a 9 month old Rottie/Dobie mix and he weighs 60 lbs."

Rottweiler,32xrs9,rollotherottie,2,Fri Apr 17 19:14:14 2015 UTC,Seems like I am not too far off....$60 month for grain free.
Rottweiler,32xrs9,CeceMarie,2,Sat Apr 18 03:09:38 2015 UTC,"i think it depends what sort of diet you want your pup to be on.   my parents make an meat/oatmeal sort of soup and mix it in with dry food for our guys. they get about 3-4 cups of dry food (half per feeding) with a scoop of the soup. they purchase large bags of dog food from costco. i would say it's about $50-$60/month (or longer, probably closer to 2 months) (cad) to feed two guys.   if you go raw food diet, you're likely going to be spending more..   ps. both sport and deuce who i've posted weigh about 100-105lbs"

I can be holding him up above my head and saying ""No, he's old, hates kids and WILL snap at them!"" and they're still like ""Go play with the little puppy!"""
Rottweiler,32tbvo,Aetra,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:41:46 2015 UTC,"The dogs you've listed have a statistically higher ratio of fatal attacks.  This is due to bad owners, the breeds' sizes, and their guarding characteristics.  Generally, those fatal attacks are stranger attacks.  So an unsocialized Lab is dangerous, and an unsocialized Rottie is more dangerous.  All of that could be prevented, though, with responsible ownership."
Rottweiler,32tbvo,KSSLR,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:02:39 2015 UTC,I'm fortunate. Where I live rotties aren't popular and the one's you see are usually behind a fence.  I'm one of the few people who people who walk them regularly.  I get a lot of positive reactions because people rarely seems them out and about and they are so adorable.

Rottweiler,32tbvo,charmingtortoise,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:27:10 2015 UTC,"it's funny. i remember going camping this one time at a place called christina lake. the guy at the front asked us if we had dogs, we said yes. they said alright and let us through.  we parked and set everything up. walking by different camps, dogs would bark. people walked their dogs past our camp, our dogs barked. fairly standard occurrence..?? few minutes later, manager of the campground comes by and says to us ""you didn't tell us you had rottweilers"". we replied with a ""we told you we had dogs, didn't think it mattered what the breed was. you didn't ask"".  we got kicked out of the campground.   i've grown up with rotties. never once has one of our dogs growled at us (other than our oki doki who had a rumble -not growl- when you hugged him, but that was his ""grandpa like"" why-are-you-cuddling-me-you-midget-alien-thing), even when i was a toddler sticking my hands all up in their food; or other people.  you put me by a toy breed, i'm scared shitless. those fuckers are terrifying and mean!"

When we took him to the vet, they told us that getting surgery would be for strictly cosmetic reasons and that he'd still develop arthritis. It doesn't affect him too much though.

Rottweiler,32hrl3,thezow,3,Mon Apr 13 22:16:13 2015 UTC,"That is a decent price for Rottweiler puppies. Registered with the AKC. Lots of folks will say you need to get hips, elbow, eye checks with both parents, that will double the price you going to pay for a ""quality"" dog if it meets all of the standards and could be shown in the ring. If you looking for a family pet rott go meet the parents evaluate their demeanor if you are happy with mom and dad $850 is a very fair price."
Rottweiler,32hrl3,normalville,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:23:42 2015 UTC,"this!! meet the parents. make sure you can! the hips, eyes and elbow certifications are great for people who are wanting to show the rotty and who do not want to breed more of the bad ""things"" down the road.  if you're looking for a pet, just meet the parents and you'll be good.   but yes, this is a reasonable price for a pet rotty."
Rottweiler,32hrl3,charslo,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:57:19 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much the truth. I got mine for 1,500 CDN (about 1,200 US) with hips, elbows, and eyes done for both parents and also eyes done for the puppy. Although, my breeder is a vet-tech, so I think she got a bit of a home team discount.  I usually advise against buying puppies off craigslist, but if everything in this ad is true, this might be the one rare occasion where it's OK. Visit the dogs at their home, meet both the parents and any other dogs they have on site and make up your mind based on that info.  Also, if the breeder wants to know just as much info about you as you want to know about the dogs, it's a good sign. Mine asked for personal references, vet references and photos of my yard.  If it all checks out, the price is fair."
Rottweiler,32eq4y,SamiD08,9,Mon Apr 13 04:39:59 2015 UTC,"Small, fast moving things are candy to most dogs eyes.  She's not a lost cause, she's a dog. You're kid could have been hurt, but that was not the dogs intention and now you know to monitor those situations closer to prevent chickie decapitation. Kids and dogs should always be monitored anyway, even if the dog has never snapped at a kid or whatever you believe their temperament to be. It's just the smart thing to do. But going after bunnies and chickens is not a precursor to a toddler. She's a dog, technically a predator in the food chain, albeit more pampered than the wilder counterparts, but you can't really expect the prey instinct to disappear. I can't let my rottie near the ducks.  A few of them have lost quite a few feathers before I could pry them out of his mouth. But now I know that gate needs to be super secure.  I can't beat the prey instinct out but I can manage the situation."
Rottweiler,32eq4y,thewrongdoor,0,Mon Apr 13 06:12:19 2015 UTC,"I think the chicks will be moved to the garage for the time being. They aren't old enough to be outside yet, but are probably safest out there since the tiny human can't get out there. As much of a pain in the butt that dog is, we love her. And I'm pretty sure the wife loves her more than me."
Rottweiler,32eq4y,Jawbone220,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:26:08 2015 UTC,"Oh man. That's a tough situation for sure. I have a blue nose pit bull, and she's the absolute most timid, mild mannered dog. She will play with babies and children, is great around other dogs. She will chase cats, though. Unsure what she would do if she caught one. Not sure I want to find out. The only time she has snapped at something was another dog who was attempting to bully her.   My point in all that is, if you can keep the environment under control then I don't think she's a lost cause. If she can be kept where you know there won't be any ""prey"" such as the chickens, I think you'll be alright.   Possibly try a shock collar? If you have a chicken you aren't too attached to, and some free time, you could work with her on discouraging that behavior by having them in the same place and giving her a little zap when she tries to go for the chicken.   As for the safety of your family, that definitely needs to be a personal decision on whether you keep her or not. Safety is paramount. It sounds like she only gets aggressive after prey, but just be careful when she's around your daughter so as to prevent any disasters.  Best of luck!"

He always does the cocked 'what's that sound?' look at animals but will get visibly upset at new kinds he hasn't encountered irl. He's good with horses now after going to my friend's stables.   The most peculiar reaction to the tv was when he cried in the Sam killing scene of I am Legend. He was already up and smelling at the tv when the vampire dogs were attacking Neville and Sam.

Rottweiler,31jds1,CaptainCoral,2,Mon Apr 6 15:10:03 2015 UTC,"We aren't sure what he is mixed with, one of my moms friends found him in a dumpter in a city nearby. We know his mom was a rottie, but no idea what his dad was. He is very fuzzy! We shaved him once during a particularly hot summer, his self esteem was crushed and his fur didn't grow back the same. He likely hasn't forgiven us!"

Rottweiler,31b61o,NightsBeauty,3,Fri Apr 3 17:25:18 2015 UTC,"He's young so is it maybe still puppy fur? Though mine has a rougher coat than I had previously seen in a Rott, his isn't quite as fuzzy looking as yours."
Rottweiler,31b61o,ShinyLetsBeBadGuys,2,Fri Apr 3 17:54:54 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing since he's young maybe he'll grown into his coat differently.  Although I have since other rotts around the same age with that perfect short shiny coat.
Rottweiler,31b61o,ecoffstt,2,Fri Apr 3 18:14:34 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that while variations are slight, there are quite a few variations in coat and face among Rotts. I was used to Rotts with super sleek almost like a hound dog's coat, but then this was my boy at eight months (he'd just had a bath and rolled in sand after) with his rougher coat. As far as faces, my boy seems to fall in the middle (his snout is a bit longer, but still a blocky square head-shape), while there are some with smaller heads and narrower snouts, and some with big rounder heads and more brachycephalic (pushed in like a bulldog or a pug) snout. Color should always be the black and tan (with very rare exceptions), but the tan seems to vary from the light tan yours appears to have, to a dark rust, to some having a lot more black blotting out the red markings."

Rottweiler,30yiej,adsheppa,2,Tue Mar 31 19:05:22 2015 UTC,"We've had Jupiter since late August, and the place that we adopted him said he was about a year old and fully grown and was a rotty. He weighs about 45-50 lbs and comes up to my knee, but acts like a rottweiler and looks like a miniature rottweiler. The place we adopted him from found him on the streets near an overpass. He has a funny walk, and the vet said it was from the birth canal. His head also shakes a little when he focuses on something. I'm wondering if his growth was stunted by the same thing that causes his odd walk and shaking (nothing bad). The vet and place we adopted said he should live a happy and normal life, and he sure is already!  Not sure if he's mixed, or just stunted growth. Thoughts?"
Rottweiler,30yiej,NightsBeauty,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:08:37 2015 UTC,"His ears and hind quarters lead me to believe he's not full, they remind me of perhaps an Aussie. His hind quarters seem narrow and legs sort of dainty, you mention he walks funny, is it in a high-stepping/prancing sort of way? That would also hint at an Aussie. His ears don't seem to lay forward at all, and that he can perk them straight like in the first photo is very uncharacteristic of a Rott. His muzzle also seems a bit longer and narrower as well. Nothing wrong with a mix though, they're fully welcome here as well, and it's totally adorable to think of a ""mini"" Rott. =)"

Rottweiler,307vkg,fireyose,12,Wed Mar 25 04:17:49 2015 UTC,"You need to be stable in your life.  Raising a Rottie is a lot of work.  Not just the first year either - for the full duration of their life.  They require consistent training, a lot of exercise, and you are going to spend a significant time cleaning up fur, bathing them, and picking up after their path of carnage.  They also need to be socialized.  You have to put an effort into making sure they meet and play with other dogs frequently so that they behave properly that time when they are around an unexpected dog.  Don't take the decision to raise one lightly.  That said, if you are such a stable dedicated person, they are amazingly rewarding dogs.  I'd wait until you have a solid place to live and know what your day to day schedule is.  Then think about getting one."
Rottweiler,307vkg,rykmi,1 point,Wed Mar 25 04:43:06 2015 UTC,Would you say this goes for any dog or mainly rottweilers?  I mean are they much harder then other dogs?
Rottweiler,307vkg,4Stroke,3,Wed Mar 25 10:44:10 2015 UTC,"I think every dog should have that type of dedication, but yes Rotties especially need it.  They are a high energy dog that is also smart, so if you don't do these things you can have problems with them not listening, chewing things out of boredom, etc.  They can be unpredictable around other dogs and they are strong willed, so you need to be on top of that with a significant amount of positive reinforcement through daily training.  There are certainly other breeds that are easier to raise properly."

It cost us $1000 up front, then another $1000 all together over the next 5 weeks. He luckily didn't need surgery which would have been another $4000. We now have dog insurance, which I highly recommend with big dogs. It is ideal to be able to spend time with your new pup rather than leaving them home alone 8 hrs a day from the start. So if you've got the time & money then you're looking good :)"
Rottweiler,307vkg,liz_lemon_lover,3,Fri Mar 27 01:28:45 2015 UTC,Yeah. take a few weeks vacation and spend it at home with the puppy. Make sure to go out for a bit at a time though so the puppy doesnt get overly dependent on you always being around. By the time you go back to work/school the puppy should be used to you being gone for 5 or so hours with her/him barking for you to come home.  Also limit them to a single room while you are gone until they are older and bigger. Also Puppy kindergarten is the best investment you could ever do.

Lots of dogs wind up in shelters because of this.  I've wanted dogs my whole life, but I waited until I owned a house to get them.    It sounds like you're going to be starting a new chapter in your life pretty soon, looking for a job, and possibly moving.  Make sure you can settle down and be home to take care of a dog.  That said I have two am staff terriers and I consider them members of the family, well worth the effort to train and take care of them.  (Also please rescue, there's too many dogs living in shelters)"
Rottweiler,307vkg,joey52685,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:52:08 2015 UTC,"a new chapter in your life pretty soon, looking for a job, and possibly moving. Make sure you can settle down and be ho   True unless it is illegal for any apartment to deny you because you have a dog in your state/province.   For example. In Ontario you can move into any place where you do not share a common room. (So like if you have your own apartment and are not a room mate or something weird) Bring your 2 Rotties in and enjoy life.  Even if in the lease there is a no pet clause written 45 times. Even if it states, No dogs, No rottweilers, No animal over 30 pounds, No black and brown dog, Nothing that goes woof.   It cannot be enforced and it voids that section of the lease.  You are legally protected in Ontario to own a pet and it is a human right to have it live with you as long as it is not attacking people, harming the building physically or barking all the time.  So.. Check where you live and see if any such laws are made for you as well :)  If you do have a Rottie in an apartment though make sure its at minimum a 2 bedroom and bring your dog out to the park for an hour or so a day. Dont let the poor thing just sleep its life away."
Rottweiler,307vkg,Tiggymartin,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:25:34 2015 UTC,"If it's in your lease then I wouldn't recommend it.  Legal or not you don't want to have a bad relationship with your landlord, they can make your life very annoying."
Rottweiler,307vkg,joey52685,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:31:45 2015 UTC,True but on the same note.. You can have the city revoke their rental license and put them out of a family job. The last thing a landlord ever wants is a disgruntled rentee :P  But on that note. Its best to talk to the landlord and be honest and see if they really care or not. If they do then make a judgment call.

Rottweiler,2zuxg9,hippybaby,1 point,Sun Mar 22 00:33:55 2015 UTC,"I have two Rotts and a rott-gsd mix and they love their little kiddie pool that we fill up during the summer. The mix loves to blow bubbles in the water too, haha. Such a nice way for them to cool off too!  We have one of those 4-5' across plastic kiddie pools and we fill it about 3 inches from the top. I would honestly recommend plastic over inflatable cause my Rotts love to paw at the bottom and like gnaw/bite at the bottom of the pool and the water with their teeth. It's also easy for them to get in and out of because it's not the deepest.  If your guys are outside a lot like mine, be prepared to dump out the water after they're done cause it gets dirty fast.  I know it may not be feasible to store one of those plastic pools for you, but I would highly recommend them over inflatable. YMMV tho and your Rotts might be a little more gentle than my guys."
Rottweiler,2zuxg9,Joecool4433,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:19:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your suggestions! I do in fact have space for plastic pools (I am guessing the fibreglass fish pool type?) and your concern is one of my concern too.   May I ask roughly how deep is the water for them to enjoy themselves? I am hoping they get to do some exercise besides just laying around in the water. I have a friend who built a pool for his rotts only and his pool is 1.5m deep (slightly below 5 ft), they can swim, splash around and stand on their hind legs when they want. I am looking for a minimum depth for a good time, would you say below a metre works?"
Rottweiler,2zuxg9,Joecool4433,2,Sun Mar 22 02:29:47 2015 UTC,"We use one like this. I'm on mobile and forget the formating so here's a url to a pic.  http://www.truevalue.com/assets/product_images/styles/large/789040.jpg  It's nothing for really swimming but to have them cool off and have some fun so the water depth may be 6"" at most.  I think your friend has a great idea and it sounds like one worth copying or you may be able to find something a little smaller like one of these.  http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71Y1Z6zfEGL.jpg  http://citychiconafarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0213.jpg  Those would work nicely but you might need to give them a stepping stool or something to get in and out easy."

Rottweiler,2ysmfc,CS01,2,Thu Mar 12 18:08:04 2015 UTC,Orijen. We tried a few others like Blue Buffalo and similar brands but Orijen seems to be the best for both dogs' tummys and overall health and energy.

If you tell them to leave it, they won't have the chance to put whatever object it is in their mouth. I think its especially important if you're getting a puppy. For my 9month old rottie, that's probably the most used command, but he's a chewer. He will go for every item on the table. You tell him to leave it, he'll move to the next, until you give him a toy or a walk."
