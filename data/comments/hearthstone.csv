hearthstone,3e2w92,BrofistMeatbear,3,Tue Jul 21 15:47:05 2015 UTC,"But regular sports aren't segregated. That is a common misconception. The NFL, tennis, and various other leagues do not forbid women from competing in what people think are the men's league.   http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/03/female-kicker-trying-out-for-nfl/  They just arent good enough to qualify or compete in the mixed league. The reason female leagues exist is so that it provides women with an opportunity to still compete at the sport."
hearthstone,3e2w92,maraxusofk,21,Tue Jul 21 18:32:18 2015 UTC,There is no reason to speculate on why there is a performance difference between men and women. The reason to segregate is because men are over-represented in gender-neutral tournaments. It's that simple. If you look at the numbers and its 99% men for several years of competition then there is an incentive for women-only tournaments. Thats it. If the ratio changes then so do the incentives.

hearthstone,3e2w92,devotedpupa,2,Tue Jul 21 18:32:08 2015 UTC,"Just as a follow-up then, why is a male dominated competitive space incentive for women-only tournaments? As in, if in a gender neutral competition men are dominant but are likewise the best performing, regardless of the reason, why bother creating a women's only league? To make the sport/competition more attractive to women who wouldn't be enticed by a male dominated competitive field? So it's basically a business move to garner more views?"
hearthstone,3e2w92,sirbeanward,7,Tue Jul 21 17:40:33 2015 UTC,"All public events are business moves to garner more views. Its about finding an audience, and there are a bunch of women on this planet."
hearthstone,3e2w92,lite951,2,Tue Jul 21 17:53:03 2015 UTC,"Personally, I feel like if they're going to segregate to build an audience, they should also work towards getting women involved to begin with, and ultimately integrating by having some major integrated tournaments when the player base allows it.  I find it very hard to believe that there is a performance gap between genders in a game like Hearthstone, but I understand that segregated tournaments can help build the female player base."
hearthstone,3e2w92,Tekro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:02:04 2015 UTC,"There are very few ""mens only"" sports or e-sports teams, contests, or leagues. Even things like the NFL are technically gender indiscriminate, its just that when you take the top .01% of men playing football and the top .01% of women, the testosterone factor gives the men such an advantage that even the top .00001% of women don't hit the top .01% of men. Thus you get the sausage fest of mainstream sports.  That doesn't really apply in esports, which is why we do see women placing and occasionally winning in Starcraft / League / Hearthstone / etc. What does happen though is that because the general audience is a sausagefest, while the skill curves are almost certainly near identical between a sampling of men and women playing card games, if you are 10 million men and 1 million women you have 10 one in a million male players to every female one.  So yeah, these tournaments are only about sending the message ""yes, girls play this game too"". If the female audience of HS ever approached 50% having womens only tournaments would become quite inappropriate and sexist, because that would almost certainly mean the number of female placements in major events would approach 50% as well assuming there isn't additional factors making some women less interested in competitive HS than men, which could absolutely be a factor if most new women playing the game are coming in from phones and tablets."
hearthstone,3e2w92,Xanny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:58:00 2015 UTC,"The ""performance difference"" is just due to the sheer difference in quantity of players between both genders, specially between those that take it as far as professionally. More players -> More quality."

hearthstone,3e2w92,AdamNW,12,Tue Jul 21 16:19:49 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of a lot of factors. Fewer females play, historically females have been discouraged from doing nondomestic things and tradition is too powerful in a lot of places (even in developed nations), females are socially expected to be humble which makes it less likely that they get exposure for their achievements and get involved with public events, etc.  Some of these are changing, but jeez, society has not made it easy to approach."
hearthstone,3e2w92,mymindpsychee,8,Tue Jul 21 16:30:59 2015 UTC,"Don't you think that you're, perhaps, making a lot of assumptions about why women in general are not as prevalent in competitive gaming as men?"
hearthstone,3e2w92,sirbeanward,4,Tue Jul 21 17:33:34 2015 UTC,"I can only speak for myself—and I’m sure there are other factors involved--but a lot of the discouragement about being an adult woman in gaming comes from people who don’t game, especially from my female peers. Very, very few of my female friends know I game, since the perception they generally have about video games is that they are a “childish” pastime you’re expected to outgrow, if they even consider them socially acceptable to begin with. I wouldn't be surprised if other female gamers encounter these attitudes from non-gamers as well. And I'm just still talking about casually playing, let alone getting into the can of worms that is competitive gaming.  I'm sure this stigma still exists in general for male gamers as well, but think about how girls are expected to and encouraged to mature faster than boys (generally speaking). There’s a bunch of other factors, I’m sure (like game marketing, male-dominated gaming culture, etc…). But for me, the biggest discouragement comes from others not really recognizing my hobby as an acceptable way for me to pass the time, especially as a woman. Fortunately I feel that the stigma is decreasing as nerd culture in general becomes more prevalent."
hearthstone,3e2w92,ThiefParade,3,Tue Jul 21 18:37:52 2015 UTC,"I mean, at the base level, I am assuming that females have less exposure to gaming than males and that tradition is a powerful force. Everything else can be derived from those assumptions. And I don't think the assumptions are false."

hearthstone,3e2w92,agentbueller,8,Tue Jul 21 17:17:40 2015 UTC,"For many sports, what is called the ""male"" division vernacularly is actually technically the mixed one, there is a mixed one and a female one. No woman can simply qualify for the mixed one but technically the rules allow a woman to do so in the unlikely event a woman shows up with the physical performance in that sport of world class men. The rule is I guess just there for in the super unlikely event that ... I guess a lot of people would like to see it.  Random fact, Serena and Venus Williams once claimed they could beat the 200th best tennis player in the world, the number 203 took up the challenge and dominated them.  http://observer.theguardian.com/osm/story/0,,543962,00.html   But esports? That's silly :)   Don't be too sure, if you subscribe to the argument that there should be gender segregation because of statistical variation of physical aptitude between the sexes (I personally don't but hey). You will find for instance that men have been found to have significantly better hand eye coördination to women, a skill that probably leads to them dominating darts and say CS:GO.  http://www.columbia.edu/itc/anthropology/v1007/jakabovics/mf2.html  You'd be surprised how much statistical difference in aptitude there is between the sexes, but this is all statistical is the important thing. It's not going to be hard to find a woman that has better hand-eye coördination than 85% of men. The thing is, that near the absolute top level, statistics tend to extremify. So if say men only have a 5% superior hand eye coördination on average, what you will find is that the top 200 people on the planet in terms of hand eye coördination are all male. That is how it seems to go at least."

In HS case (and some other games such as poker, etc) regular tournaments are open to everyone but mostly dominated by a male population, which may be intimidating for the few females willing to compete.

There's not exactly a great representation of women in esports, and if this is an avenue to get them into the scene, get them some experience, and move them into the larger esports scene, then great.   I understand it's a necessary evil if esports is to become more accessible to women. Right now, esports (of the HS variety, I'm not familiar with LoL, CS, et al.) seems rather insular.

hearthstone,3e2w92,FacehuntersAnonymous,92,Tue Jul 21 18:43:01 2015 UTC,"I'm from China, and I think I could explain some reasons why they hold the tournament like this.  I don't think imbaTV meant to segerate genders or to belittle women. In fact we always have female players in our Gold-Series HS tournament which hold several times a year, and eveytime a female player emerge, the hosts and audience would pay extra attention and care to them, in a Chinese way of kindness, as there are very few female in this industry. In my opinion, the motive imbaTV hold this tournament is to extend this kindness and wish more female players come to play. And they probably think the whole ""feminine style"" is just a ""theme"" or ""topic"" of this tournament. Maybe in their mind, to stress some feminine stereotype is just their way to ""respect"" women.  China did not experience many of the human right movements like western country did decades ago, such as minority right(black people, etc) and sex right. So many Chinese did not have the same notion of ""political correctness"" as westerners.  So people who come to China for the first time may find that Chinese people tend to be somewhat nationalist, racist, sexist in modern western standards. It's a very deep social and cultural phenomena worth discuss, but I won't elaborate this issue here.  As China is more and more open to the world, the communication between this old country and the world going on, eventually I believe Chinese people would reach the same point as other places in the world. Right now, I just hope people who know little about Chinese culture and history try to be a little more patient and tolerate when misunderstanding happens.  Edit: rephrased some sentences, added some thoughts."

For us it may be sexist (not for me, i just think that was poorly executed in some ways), but we are a western culture, way, way different, so maybe we should put on the shoes of the chinese and see it that way."

(not to mention a few college and grad school courses relating to China...)  That's a load of BS about women in China.  Whatever else you can say about the communists, they took a sledghammer to the social structure and it was one of the swiftest transformations of gender equality (from a DEEPLY sexist culture) witnessed in history of anywhere.  The strictly enforced gender equality(ish) principles in Chinese communism played, and continues to play, a hugely important role in everything China's able to do on a global scale.  Sure, the top-level political and economic power are still concentrated in the hands of men, but that's true in most Western places as well.  And, it's not just Beijing.  Here's the english wikipedia article on current gender inequality in China as a whole:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_inequality_in_China  Not saying there's no sexism in China today (there's sexism in the West as well), but the whole lack of ""human rights movements like western country"" thing you're writing about is just BS when it comes to overall impact of sexism and lack of a ""human rights movement"" in China.  There may not have been a ""human"" rights movement, but there was a hugely successful ""women's"" rights movement, and that's what this topic is about.  Not the rights of minorities, not the rights of anti-government protest, just gender equality.  Add the fact that Chinese women atheletes perform better than thier men counterparts in physical sports on the international level (and are not ridiculed in the Chinese media in the way this event seems to be themed), points to a specific problem in esports, or maybe esports in China, or maybe just this organization running this particular tournament.  It is NOT reflective of current Chinese culture or the current political/socio-economic situation in China."
hearthstone,3e2w92,adwcta,13,Tue Jul 21 17:34:12 2015 UTC,"You missed my point.  I said China didn't have human rights movements like western country, but I didn't mean Chinese are all sexist, or there's no sex equality change or debate in China. All I said was Chinese people are somewhat sexist in western people's eyes (like this tournament inccident).  China has it's own unique way to achieve gender equality, that leaves a total different social environment towards this issue compared to western country."
hearthstone,3e2w92,hythl0day,3,Tue Jul 21 17:44:21 2015 UTC,"I'm also from China, and while I do agree with China has a different social environment towards gender equality, I do not agree that the response should be tolerance.   Culturally, China does struggle with sexism, especially in media. Like you mentioned, it is not perceived by many Chinese that to focus on looks and beauty during a competition that requires none is sexist and limiting. Yet this attitude does harm women - both the ones that are attempting to get into esports and the average woman on the street who is taken less seriously due to these cultural beliefs. This is an issue that was commonly discussed when I visited my friends in Beijing.   How is toleration and patience going to help when to many Chinese, this is not a misunderstanding? The West hardly stood by in ""tolerance and patience"" for apartheid in South Africa. Sexism, like racism, should not be brushed off as simply culture, lest there be no change.      I also agree with adwcta that historically, China did have a human rights movement with respect to gender equality during Mao's years. After all, it was he who said the famous line about ""women holding up half the sky"". It is incorrect to pretend as if China has not been exposed to these ideas even before China opened up to the world (which was almost 40 years ago at this point)."

If Wikipedia is correct (it quotes a 2013 source that isn't available anymore), the turf is also artificial there : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hortons_Field  Now I know nothing about sport event organization or turf maintenance, but does it really happen that a stadium switch its turf to grass for one event (meaning they would then revert to artificial turf after the event) ?  Seems to me that it's just a combination of two factors :  1) The FIFA wanted the event to be held in certain major cities, to draw as much attention as possible, and several of these cities happen to have artificial turf  2) It is tricky to select other venues that don't have an equivalent artificial turf as the others, that would create injustices between teams. What would happen in the final stages ? If the final is held on one turf, a team that spent the rest of the tournament playing on the other one might be at a disadvantage.  I am not saying playing on artificial turf is fine, I just read something about the crazy temperatures on the ground. Just saying it's maybe not about ""women not being worth anything better"" and is maybe more complicated."
hearthstone,3e2w92,_Kak0_,4,Tue Jul 21 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"Not a soccer expert either, but IIRC, artificial is way more cheaper to maintain and shittier to play on, and generally not of enough quality for any serious competition.

hearthstone,3e2w92,Aerhyce,5,Tue Jul 21 16:52:12 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of different types of artificial surfaces that range from feeling like concrete to not that bad when you fall. Both NFL and top NCAA teams use artificial surfaces, but in general you're right, they are cheaper to maintain with that level of wear and tear. The main difference though is they play a lot differently than grass. In general, they are faster. So a lot of teams with artificial surfaces also run fast, spread pass-heavy attacks to take advantage of their home field. Grass is a little more favorable for a physical running game. The problem in particular for FIFA is no serious soccer team plays on artificial surfaces (in part because soccer is easier on grass than football.) The ball rolls further and faster than on grass, so at the highest level of competition, you are requiring all the women athletes to play out of their comfort zone and adjust on the fly — just because you decided to use whatever is available rather than try to secure World Cup venues for them that were best suited for the sport."

And the CFL, who plays on turf, are currently playing in soem of those stadiums, so there was no chance of replacing it.  On top of which, this is Canada, so 1) grass growing/maintenance can be unpredictable with our climate sometimes, and 2) with many thousands of miles between stadiums, this kept pitch quality more consistent.  We didn't build anything for the tourney, we used existing facilities. I'm sure if we went the way of Brazil and built a bunch there would be some grass involved."

hearthstone,3e2w92,Vacancies,4,Tue Jul 21 16:16:24 2015 UTC,"How could it be an issue as long as other tournaments accept all genders.  The best argument for women-only tournaments is that they give women a chance to get in the spotlight, improve within their own skill level and gain sponsors thus furthering their ability to go full-time and improve. This applies more to CSGO (the other eSport I follow) than Hearthstone which I honestly don't know much about its female players. In CSGO, the best female players can barely compete against the worst C-tier male team. I like to think this has more to do with female players not having the experiences, resources and support. It's the same reason why EU in general is way ahead of NA, because the talent pool is much lower, sponsors aren't there to help players go full-time, and they can only practice against lower tier players in their same region. This changed a lot in the past year but I feel this applies to female players now. I know I'm going on about CSGO but I'm just writing about what I know here. To end on a positive note, CLG just signed an NA female team and got an Intel sponsorship all while female tournaments are offering bigger prize pools so progress is definitely happening and I really, really doubt that progress would have happened without female tournaments."

A better thing would be to have sex be irrelevant to the tournament and let player skill dictate it.    Hearthstone as a game is already pretty female friendly. It has decent representation in class characters without feeling like it was a forced decision that insults player intelligence. There are strong female characters as just part of the game, rather than existing because they needed strong female characters. And the interface is entirely ambiguous.

If the point is to encourage more women to play, promote the high level female players and say ""hey, women can play too"" rather than separating them and saying ""women can play with other women""    Skill isn't related to sex. Skill is related to IQ and dedication. My guess as to why we don't have more females in professional levels? Less interest. Masculine people are more competitive by nature, testosterone drives this.    If a woman wanted to invest the same level of time as Reynad or Trump, they could reach the same level.

Until that sort of experience disadvantage is overcome, it's going to be nearly impossible for female teams to compete. You have some shining examples of females who managed to make it in competitive games (Tossgirl for SC:BW, Eloise for HS) but for the majority, the skill gap is currently too large to be overcome.

I can see your argument's validity when it comes to physical sports but can't really stand by it when it comes to online stuff.  Or at the very least have some sort of group for women that gets focus but isn't exclusionary, kinda like a big e-sports team or something; that would be cool."
hearthstone,3e2w92,silverhydra,10,Tue Jul 21 16:55:49 2015 UTC,"Women in chess have been going through this for decades. It's not new and it's been widely observed. There simply are not that many women playing the game, if you have a talent pool shortage then the quality of players from that pool is going to be sub-par compared to the general pool. Which is why a gender specific league can help to promote the game and increase the size of the talent pool."
hearthstone,3e2w92,lukertin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:18 2015 UTC,"honestly, if they have spent less time playing i do not understand how that directly relates to the gender itself. Though i do understand what you are getting at, basically women are less likely to show interest in gaming at a younger age, giving them less time to hone their skills (if that's even the wording you can use to describe playing video games). But if they are worst at the game because they have played less they are just straight up worst at the game. there should not be a handicap (female only tornies) because of this. You're not as good as other players because you've played less? then a tournament is not for you, regardless of gender."
hearthstone,3e2w92,CobaltCannon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:06 2015 UTC,it's not a handicap. they're not getting special rules against men. they're playing just each other in a small tournament intended to foster women's interest in gaming and participation in competitive scenes. why would you have a problem with that? would you have a problem with a youth or a senior tournament? also it's not a simple matter of playing less.
hearthstone,3e2w92,byanyothernombre,0,Tue Jul 21 18:48:18 2015 UTC,Men do have a slightly faster reaction time than women in average. About a tenth of a second. That could be the difference between men dominating the general ranks in fast twitch games.

hearthstone,3e2w92,kaybo999,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:53 2015 UTC,"No sources, I just thought it was general knowledge. If you watch the olympics it will be referenced from time to time that men get out of the gate faster than woman. Its minimal at the highest level, but with average people the gap widens.   I did a bit of quick googling(nothing i have confidence reposting here), it looks like its not just reaction times, but types of sensory inputs result in different times as well. Women are much closer with audible responses. But the big key is spacial awareness. This is something men seem to really pull away in. That could really effect FPS games like counter strike, and reaction times would help in quick response games like street fighter. Outside of that, it seems very even on the E-Sports front.   Also, it seems like the best age to play games is 17-23, I might need to join some masters leagues at 29."

There aren't any top-tier competitive games where the ability to distinguish the nuance of a color's hue give the competitor some great advantage.

While physical differences between sexes are large enough to make a gender difference in contact sports (ex. hockey or american football) valid the cognitive differences are very minor.  Plus if the topic is discussed at length then you find minor 'benefits' for both sexes, numerous ones hard to quantify and in the end are really more mind candy than valid reasons for a segregation. They're plentiful but minor in magnitude and, honestly, small enough they can be completely reworked or overridden with enough practise at the game.  Edit: Just want to put out there that playing games can alter cognition so it isn't unlikely that the possible sex difference in percetion can be overridden."
hearthstone,3e2w92,silverhydra,30,Tue Jul 21 16:39:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think the point of this tournament was to create a barrier between men and women in pro hearthstone,  but rather to encourage women to get into the professional scene.  Most could count on one hand the current professional women hearthstone players, even though there is obviously no reason women would be somehow inherently worse at hearthstone than their male counterparts.  It begs the question, why are there so little female players?  It probably has more to do with societal differences where there's more males playing hearthstone than females."

I don't mean to offend twitch or hearthstone users, but according to a survey done on this subreddit your typical hearthstone player is age 18-22 and, IIRC, something like 80 percent were single.  I couldn't find the survey, so take that stat with a grain of salt, but when you think of your average twitch user it doesn't sound far off the mark.  This is probably because hearthstone is considered by most to be a pretty nerdy game (nothing wrong with that).  Female gamers do probably feel a great deal of pressure from a community comprised of single young men, but it's nobodies fault.  Just a symptom of the community the game attracts."
hearthstone,3e2w92,Ninivagg,8,Tue Jul 21 16:00:32 2015 UTC,"Oh, I definitely disagree that it's nobody's fault.

There should NEVER be any mention of a person's sex in the requirements for a tournament.    An all male/female tournament is the dumbest possible thing you could do in esports unless you want the controversy to drive interest.    Edit: A female only tournament does not promote female players, it promotes the idea that female players can't compete with male players. If you want to promote female players in esports then actually promote the female players that are playing at high levels. Put them in the marketing materials.    Special treatment is not better. Equal treatment is the goal. Treat women like you do men, as equal human beings with the same valid level of skill."

But using a person's sex to encourage others of the same sex to play isn't a bad thing.

It's just PR, it's part of the show. Trying to make woman look as beautiful as possible isn't sexist or sells them short, it's simply entertainment.

And since Hearthstone is one of the most accessible games, we should have seen more female players at the highest level by now. As it is, only a handful of female players have made any kind of impact.   This particular paragraph stinks of equity. There are exactly the same opportunities for men and women to reach the highest level. So if there are not more females at the highest level maybe they are just not good enough. ... Nah, that's bullshit...  Now, I get it. It seems ridiculous for us westeners to see a tourney where the organizators tell the girls what to wear but then again, it was a part of the tournament. If they didn't feel it was appropriate they didn't have to go throught with it period. Nothing wrong with that at all.  My second issue, now with the tourney, is why the hell do we need male / female tournaments? I get it why they do it in sports like hockey or rugby because the girls would get demolished by the 200 pound sprinting jocks. But in HS? Seriously? It's like telling the girls: ""Oh you poor dumb silly babies. We know you have no chance against the brainy nerds because you are just boobs on legs.

Females have traditionally been discouraged from playing games which has led to a massive experience advantage generated by the top male players in every esport. A female league is a good way to create an environment in which women can begin to catchup in experience and mechanical skill.

Esports suffer no such issue, due to being primarily intellectual competitions, therefore there's little to no justification for gender seperated leagues.

If there is one thing I hate it is injustice, and to seggregate genders when both genders are mentally capable/equal is on every level wrong.  I support all people who want to play Esports and I understand women receive a lot of shittalk while playing. Maybe the community desperately needs more female influence, however right is right and seggregating genders is wrong."

hearthstone,3e1fzf,Guyjp,15,Tue Jul 21 14:47:18 2015 UTC,"well,    Archmage Antonidas gives you a fireball everytime you cast a spell Sorcerer's Apprentice reduces the cost of spells by 1 Echo of Medivh gives you a copy of every friendly card on board Emperor Thaurissan reduces the cost of every card in your hand by 1 at the end of the turn Duplicate is a mage secret that gives you two copies of a minion that the enemy destroys   So as Mage you can just play Emperor Thaurissan and reduce the cost of Archmage Antonidas from 7 to 6, the cost from Sorcerer's Apprentice from 2 to 1 and the cost from Echo of Medivh from 4 to 3.  If you manage to duplicate Sorcerer's Apprentice and then get a copy of at least two with Echo of Medivh you have 4 Sorcerer's Apprentice, that reduce the cost of Fireball to 0.  Play Emperor Thaurissan with the 4 Sorcerer's Apprentice  (or 3 and 1 on board, 2 and 2 on board or 1 and 3 on board), Archmage Antonidas and a triggerspell that does not cost more than 5 in your Hand.  Congratulations, you can now successfully spam Fireballs for 0 Mana :D"
hearthstone,3e1fzf,Darkdrop,2,Tue Jul 21 15:03:02 2015 UTC,"Archmage Antonidas (the 5/7) gives you a Fireball each time you cast a spell. Sorceress apprentice (3/2) makes your spells cost one less. He used Echo of Medivh (put copies of all minions on your board into your hand) to get 4 Sorceress apprentices, making Fireball (4 mana, deal 6 damage) free. Every time he casts a (free) Fireball, he gets a new one from Archmage Antonidas."
hearthstone,3e1fzf,RGodlike,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:06 2015 UTC,"Sorcerers apprentice reduces the cost of spells by 1, archmage antonidas gives you a fireball for every spell you cast, including fireball. Echo of mediev copies all the minions you have on the board, duplicate gives you 2 copies of the first minion your opponent kills and puts it in hand, and emperor T reduces the cost of all cards in your hand by 1 at the end of each turn.   To make this combo work, you have to make it to turn 10 and get 7 mana cost reduction across 5 cards, the archmage, 2 apprentice, and 1 echo. This is most commonly done by playing emperor into a duplicate, ensuring you get 2 rounds of discounts unless they turn emperor into something else before killing it.   You then play both sorcerers, the archmage, then echo, giving you 2 more sorcerers and a fireball. The 7 mana discount ensures you can immediately play those 2 sorcerers and discount fireball to 0."

It's so painful in, say, Control Warrior, if you have to decide between safely removing every threat at the cost of some card advantage, or brawling. Brawl's animation is very long, and you can't take any actions during it.. This has cost me a game at least once.  One thing that upsets me in particular is that they added the rope to custom matches. Nothing sadder than seeing someone rope in a tournament. I know, 'it's part of the game', etc., but I really, I don't think it should be. I really hope for a tournament mode that has a chess-like timer (like in Magic Online)."
hearthstone,3e1fzf,Shikogo,2,Tue Jul 21 13:53:38 2015 UTC,Well that would really suck for freeze mages or decks that actually require thinking before you ping and end turn.

hearthstone,3e1fzf,Highside79,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:33 2015 UTC,"I think even better would be to wait until the last couple seconds, blizzard, then queue up the double fireball.  The blizzard is like an overdrive that increases your fireball output for a second (because you have two to queue) but slows down afterwards (frothing).  Yeah fireballing the frothing was an option too, but then you lose out on a fireball which you immediately get back by the double queue without the frothing animation, so it balances out to the same amount of time as not blizzarding at all.  TLDR: blizzzard at the last couple seconds"

It took him about 3 seconds to cast a Fireball and get it back in the hand (2:04 to 2:13 he casted 3 fireballs and had one in his hand in the end). It also takes a little shorter when you have 2 fireballs because you don't have to wait for it to return to your hand.  At 2:34 (154s) the Warrior had 38 health left, so it'd take 7 Fireballs (38/6 rounded up) to kill him. 7 * 3s = 21s.  The turn ends at 185s. 154s + 21s = 175s.  175 < 185  His turn would probably not rope."

Using blizzard gets him a 2nd fireball which he can more quickly kick out and maybe beat the timer.  Think he had to cast fireball 6 more times to win.

I feel like this deck is definitely not unstoppable."
hearthstone,3e1fzf,TheRealGoodman,167,Tue Jul 21 08:25:25 2015 UTC,The difference is that this deck isn't good and Patron is literally the best in the game
hearthstone,3e1fzf,SigurdZS,9,Tue Jul 21 10:22:40 2015 UTC,I hope a deck built around this combo can never quite be good enough. The last thing I want to see is it go from special to obnoxious.  That said this version has it's strong counters.
hearthstone,3e1fzf,toadofsteel,8,Tue Jul 21 08:37:21 2015 UTC,"That is the thing that annoys me about Patron Warrior - I think the patrons themselves and wonky combos with them are awesome, but the poor little buggers get so much hate because of Frothing synergy :L"
hearthstone,3e1fzf,SigurdZS,3,Tue Jul 21 11:29:33 2015 UTC,"Thats why I think ""Patron"" warrior is a misnomer... it should be Frothing Warrior... i've seen some spectacular combos with that card that didn't involve Patrons at all."
hearthstone,3e1fzf,WindsAndWords,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:09 2015 UTC,Sometimes it feels like the patrons are only there to proc Frothing.
hearthstone,3e1fzf,CognitiveAdventurer,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:33 2015 UTC,"Well its not really. Frothing used to be the only win condition for this kind of deck, but now it's both Grim Patron's and the Frothing Berserker's. This is why it's called patron warrior so you know it's separate from the old frothing deck."
hearthstone,3e1fzf,jazzyy,2,Tue Jul 21 16:14:31 2015 UTC,Eye for an eye new meta?
hearthstone,3e1fzf,weewolf,6,Tue Jul 21 14:06:28 2015 UTC,the thing about combo mage is it is a bit easier to side deck against with things like kezan mystic and loatheb.
hearthstone,3e1fzf,vallerfax,8,Tue Jul 21 09:35:40 2015 UTC,"I really hope Thaurissan doesn't get hit   Thauriassn should be hit for the same reason Pagle got hit, it's a card that high impact and you have zero chance to respond to it before it has an opportunity to completely change the match."
hearthstone,3e1fzf,JermStudDog,21,Tue Jul 21 11:30:01 2015 UTC,thaurisan is also 6 mana. Pagle was nerfed because every game you would coin him and he doesnt die to frostbolt. Also drawing cards is a lot more powerful than reducing their cost. Especially when every deck could play nat.
hearthstone,3e1fzf,weewolf,11,Tue Jul 21 11:47:41 2015 UTC,"For the record, this type of thinking is exactly what makes Hearthstone a boring game.  TCGs are very random by nature.  The best decks in any game make use of either battlecry effects or immediate bomb (leave it alone for 1 turn and likely lose the game) effects to generate value in a random game.  The reason both of these styles are so good is because they purposely limit your opponents opportunity to react to them.  Hearthstone drags things out 2-3 turns and no deck seems to be allowed to draw out consistent threats without the internet hating it to hell.  Freaking Face Hunter was cried about for over 6 months and none of their cards hit for more than 5 health.  If we can't play agro, and we can't play combo, what is an aggressive style that is OK to play?"
hearthstone,3e1fzf,greeklemoncake,6,Tue Jul 21 12:53:27 2015 UTC,"Then the problem is the lack of bombs across the board then.  You have 99% of the card base passive bullshit, and two or three bombs that only work in a few decks.  They either need to defuse the bombs or throw another 20 or 30 into the mix.  This half assed design is not healthy."
hearthstone,3e1fzf,napoleondance,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:10 2015 UTC,"The problem is that all the bombs are legendary. You might not be f2p, say you have both adventures but haven't spent any money on packs... You have like 10 legendaries, exactly 2 of whom are constructed playable. You can't pretend that chromaggus and kelthuzad are acceptable replacements for geddon, sylvanas, ragnaros, alexstrasza, ysera, dr boom, grommash, antonidas, and cenarius...   So instead of playing shitty versions of control decks with bad finishers, you just play an aggro deck, OR patron warrior which is 90% soulbound cards with like 4 rares and the legendaries like harrison and grommash are optional. I actually really like patron existing in the meta because it's a non-aggro deck that doesn't require 10k dust to make."
hearthstone,3e1fzf,JermStudDog,3,Tue Jul 21 16:24:20 2015 UTC,The cards not hitting for more than 5 health doesn't take into account that we only have 30.  You shouldn't be forced to tech in health and armour just so that you don't automatically lose against aggro decks.
hearthstone,3e1fzf,toadofsteel,3,Tue Jul 21 14:10:23 2015 UTC,"That's why playing a BO3 and having a sideboard is important to the legitimacy of the game.  If you had a 30 card deck and 5 sideboard cards, you can dedicate all 5 of those cards to healing/armor to handle things like face hunter and it isn't so annoying.  It becomes an active consideration of ""how much do I want to lose vs face hunter?"" rather than just making a bad deck that leaves you unable to react to everything else in the meta.  Hearthstone needs BO3.  Hearthstone needs sideboards.  hearthstone needs a standard rotation (take old cards out of the rotation so the game can evolve in a healthy manner).  These things are pinnacles of the TCG genre and Hearthstone is ignoring them."
hearthstone,3e1fzf,JermStudDog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:52:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know if BO3 is a good idea for ladder, as it would take too long (control priest vs control warrior can run half an hour for a single match), but sideboards would be invaluable. I could choose taunts against facehunter, targeted removal against handlock, etc."
hearthstone,3e1fzf,toadofsteel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:43 2015 UTC,"The concept behind it is that nobody would play aggressive, but easily hated out decks like Facehunter without having a blank game where it will win 70+% of the time.  But when you get to bring in 2 Unstable Ghouls, 2 Earthen Ring Farseers, and 1 Elven Archer while simultaneously dropping all the 8+ mana cost junk from your own deck, you actually become favored for the next 2 games.  Overall, it ends up balancing out where you essentially GIVE them the first game, but they have to work very hard to get through that 2nd and 3rd game.  Then they can fill their sideboard with a bunch of Owls and value creatures like Highmane.  Now, without changing a single card, the complexity of the game goes way up and things that are frustrating and stupid don't seem nearly as bad.  I get what you're saying about turning ladder into a BO3 and it changing the real-world investment into playing a single game (making it up to 4x as long) but single-round TCG is just flat and boring when you compare it to something that involves any kind of sideboard action."
hearthstone,3e1fzf,Neo6488,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:44:29 2015 UTC,"I do like that the added investment time would essentially remove the appeal of facehunter (that of finishing their matches quickly), but honestly, I've gotten in trouble because lunch breaks run long, or with my family, or any number of things... because when I roll my control warrior vs a Priest, the resulting match lasts half an hour. When I had 15 minutes alloted in my personal time (i.e., lunch break) for the match.  Tripling the match time would be counter-productive to me playing hearthstone at all."
hearthstone,3e1fzf,Pendargon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:57 2015 UTC,"To add on to your comment, it could be accompanied with a change in the ladder system. Best of 3 wouldn't work with the current system.  I do feel a sideboard would be very punishing for ftp players though. Most sideboards would be something like Harrison, black knight, sludge Belcher, etc. There are some very good tech cards that all happen to be legendaries."
hearthstone,3e1fzf,Izipally,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:15 2015 UTC,"Difference is, Patron Warrior has enough flexibility to be good in 90% of situations. This.... Not so much."

It's a terrible deck with one neat trick, that if you can pull off you instantly win. I think Thaurissan needs a slight nerf, he shouldn't be able to reduce cards to zero mana.

hearthstone,3e1fzf,azura26,17,Tue Jul 21 08:12:01 2015 UTC,"It's actually legitimate because sometimes you can hit the time limit for the round and if you won the previous match you win.  I remember doing this on a tournament vs a ""time vault voltaic key"" combo, he said ""untap vault, then tap again, I get another turn and... you lose"".  To which I replied ""no, my health is still at twenty, you can play unlimited turns now you have to find a way to actually kill me"".  he ran out of time before pulling a threat (those decks only had a couple of actual finishers) and I won the round cause I was 1-0."

hearthstone,3e1fzf,Nooteboom,3,Tue Jul 21 13:05:53 2015 UTC,The deck I found uses abeyance to keep their tokens safe until they can attack. All the summoned tokens are also tapped which I think stops them from fervored and given haste.

This kind of gameplay, much like the Grim Patron Warrior, is overall really unhealthy for the game as a whole."
hearthstone,3e1fzf,hamoorftw,4,Tue Jul 21 07:38:19 2015 UTC,would giving it the nat pagle treatment still make it op?
hearthstone,3e1fzf,keelallcookies,16,Tue Jul 21 07:47:56 2015 UTC,It would kill it.
hearthstone,3e1fzf,pblankfield,6,Tue Jul 21 08:01:38 2015 UTC,"I think that would make the card more or less unplayable. It rarely survives one turn. I've been thinking a lot about this lately and here are some suggestions and reasoning behind why they aren't really valid.   Making it trigger on beginning of turn.   This I feel, as explained above, makes the card unplayable and very unreliable. Would probably get cut from all lists.   Reducing the stat line, to perhaps a 4/5 or 4/4.   Well... the inherent power aswell as the issue with the card is its effect, no denying. Reducing its stats wouldn't really solve this unless something extremely drastic, like a 2/2 for 6.   Bumping up the mana cost to 8-9 with compensated stats   Many games don't last till turn 8, decks that use Thaurissan usually does. Fair enough argument and could be pretty well implemented without ruining the powerful effect that the card actually brings to the table.   Add some kind of random element, like reducing the cost of HALF your cards.   Will never be used.   Making the mana reduction a battlecry.   It kind of already is. Most decks don't rely on several Thaurissan procs but rather one, except the echo deck shown in the video above. Making it a battlecry aswell as a deathrattle would honestly just be outright buffing the card.  SOOO.. I'm stumped. Balancing this incredibly different and powerful card must be a real tough one for blizzard. Very hard to balance a card that is only used for its effect in a cardpool that is getting quite decent in size. I'd honestly prefer that they'd go with one of the more drastic routes and reducing its auto-include status dramatically. But then again, I do love my Freeze Mage."
hearthstone,3e1fzf,Gray_Sloth,9,Tue Jul 21 08:04:02 2015 UTC,Simpliest nerf there is - Summoning Portal treatment - ... but not less than (1).  Goodbye free whirlwinds - this will drastically reduce Frothing burst.  The punishment for letting the Emperor live one turn would be much less severe as well.
hearthstone,3e1fzf,keelallcookies,2,Tue Jul 21 10:49:45 2015 UTC,"Fun fact, currently the Emperor breaks the but not less than (1) of the summoning portal.  For example, if you play Emperor with two summoning portals and any cards 5 or less mana in hand, next turn you play the first summoning portal for 3, the second for 1, and anything 5 or less mana that has been hit by the Emperor is now 0 mana, just plop down double sludge belchers, a 2-mana Troggzor, and laugh."
hearthstone,3e1fzf,TCO_Uncontested,0,Tue Jul 21 12:21:12 2015 UTC,I... haven't even considered this. This is a totally reasonable nerf that fixes most issues with Emperor Thaurissan.

That Blizzard would have cost you the game had the Warrior not been foolish and surrendered, as it caused an 8 second animation during which you couldn't play any fireballs - the equivalent of 2 fireballs."

I will always be a casual hearthstone player, I rarely play more than 5 games a day and that's how I like it.

hearthstone,3e1mso,Shengster,74,Tue Jul 21 07:01:12 2015 UTC,"Would a F2P player be better off getting just the first 4 wings of naxx (unless they like druid), and then just the first 2 wings of brm (unless they like tempo mage)?  For example your druid deck has chrommagus and KT. But if instead someone had 2100 gold to spend on packs they likely could craft Dr.Boom and a lot of other cards vs. the last 3 wings of brm."
hearthstone,3e1mso,Shadowofthedragon,47,Tue Jul 21 07:12:03 2015 UTC,"Great question! Yes that's a reasonable suggestion. Personally I think getting the 5th wing of Naxxramas is worth it because Kel'Thuzad can substitute for other Legendaries in many decks as a late-game win condition.  As for Blackrock Mountain, you can definitely get away with just purchasing the first two wings for these decks. Chromaggus can be substituted in Budget Midrange Druid for something like Boulderfist Ogre or Ironbark Protector depending on preference.  If you're good at arena and fully free-to-play, there's no reason why you shouldn't spend the remainder of your gold saved from those wings on arena to earn more GvG cards."
hearthstone,3e1mso,sohoodnerd,27,Tue Jul 21 07:19:06 2015 UTC,"I like how the term ""F2P decks"" is dead now. Instead, new players are required to purchase an expansion for real money to compete. I feel bad for them, I used to defend Hearthstone a lot back when it was free and you could make legend decks with the basic set or low dust.  Edit: Thanks for the different viewpoints. So it takes a lot of time grinding F2P, a few months to unlock the sets. I wish you guys could have legend viable decks without such a steep time curve. As a closed beta player and 6-7 win average arena player, I tried F2P BRM to see how it goes.  Took 2 or 3 months to unlock the entire expansion. Damn."
hearthstone,3e1mso,ThiefParade,12,Tue Jul 21 13:10:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's more a time thing than anything. I'm F2P and worked my way through all of BRM, and I'm currently working on grinding gold for Naxx. I don't mind, since the time it takes to earn the gold through the dailies is all the time I have to play per day (or every other day) anyway, but I understand how slow it is."
hearthstone,3e1mso,EvdK,6,Tue Jul 21 13:21:47 2015 UTC,"I started playing around the time HS got launched on mobile. I unlocked full Naxx and the first 2 wings of BRM and am still F2P. In addition the freebie packs; tavern brawl, eu compensation, galaxy s6 deal etc. got me where I am now. I have a pretty decent Patron Warrior and Tempo mage deck. I just don't have the option to switch between heroes and still be competitive but I guess that's OK since I haven't spend money on it yet."
hearthstone,3e1mso,ThiefParade,4,Tue Jul 21 13:28:56 2015 UTC,"Haha nice! It's similar for me as well, though I started in January. Warrior and Mage are my best classes (focusing on Patron right now), and I try to crank out the gold and earn as many free packs as possible. Still haven't found a way to get the Galaxy S6 packs tho--emulator didn't work for me, and none of my friends have the S6 haha.  I think it's definitely still possible for players to be F2P and enjoy the game, but I've talked with a few friends who got into HS and then dropped out a couple weeks later; if they don't want to drop real money on it to gain cards faster, then the time it takes to grind out and improve their decks doesn't appeal to them. Which is understandable, and I sometimes wonder if the longer the game goes on, the less new players will be inclined to stick with HS due to the time/money investment to enjoy playing even casually. That said, I also feel that Hearthstone is a game that takes some amount of dedication just to improve in general, to learn the cards and the strategies, so there's that as well."

Still F2P have all of naxx/mountain have about 8 legendaries, that doesn't include all the naxx/mountain expansion legendaries, and have enough cards that I can experiment with a lot of different decks.

Sure, I don't have a Dr. Boom or anything, but I have some solid decks that are really respectable.

hearthstone,3e1mso,lazy_croop,3,Tue Jul 21 17:44:30 2015 UTC,I've done all of the solo adventures on gold alone. It's entirely possible to be completely F2P if you want to spend the time.
hearthstone,3e1mso,mioraka,2,Tue Jul 21 13:33:28 2015 UTC,"Well I play sparingly on my Asia account, as it's just an alt so I spent no money on it. Now I have 4 wings of Naxx and 2 wings of BRM, with about 1k gold saved up.  I have Mech mage, Patron, hunter and zoolock which is viable for ladder.   It's still viable to go F2P, you just need to know what you are doing and spend gold and dust accordingly.  Lastly.....come the fuck on, blizzard made a great game that you probably play more than any other $60 games you've bought, and you aren't even willing to shell out 50 bucks for the advantures?"
hearthstone,3e1mso,gumboshrimps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:41 2015 UTC,"No I'm not willing to shell out 50$ for a game I play sparingly.

hearthstone,3e1mso,ERagingTyrant,3,Tue Jul 21 17:46:53 2015 UTC,"The nature of all free to play games is that if you want to catch up to people who have played for a year or more is that you have to play for a year or more as well.

I do great at arenas and attempted to unlock all BRM with arena winnings. The winnings are nerfed all to hell, I swear we got better rewards. I was surprised when it took 2-3 months to unlock all of BRM as a good arena player.   My latest walk away from computer moment came when I netted an incredible 160 gold for going 9 wins.

And the more people get good at arena, the harder it becomes for new player to grind that, too."
hearthstone,3e1mso,jayjaywalker3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:40:53 2015 UTC,I remember trying to do this briefly. Arena is a good way to get cards. You have to be really good for it to be a good way to get gold too.
hearthstone,3e1mso,gumboshrimps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:13 2015 UTC,Yea but you got like what? 3-4 packs? Maybe more? That's a lot of gold.
hearthstone,3e1mso,Tayorama,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:45 2015 UTC,You just have to anticipate the next expansions if you are going F2P. I saved up and was ready to pay for BRM at release with gold. Now I'm sitting on 4200 gold because of the upcoming expansion. Just don't buy packs. I only craft classic cards I need because I get gvg from arena enough. Always reroll 40g dailies and that 6-7 arena average makes f2p easy.
hearthstone,3e1mso,gumboshrimps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:24 2015 UTC,I never thought about rerouting 40g dailies to maximize my gold...  those are all the 3/3 quests right?
hearthstone,3e1mso,Tayorama,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:50 2015 UTC,"They are the 2 wins with specific classes, 3 with any, destroy a bunch of minions, those ones. Most likely you will reroll another 40g quest but you should always reroll the low ones and sometimes I even hold on to them until the next day because there is a chance the new quest is worth more and I can reroll the low again. You have a chance of getting a free classic or 100g as well as 60g quests so you need to do this. Your income goes up a lot if you are in the habit."

hearthstone,3e1mso,tom641,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:21 2015 UTC,The addition of Tavern Brawl helps F2P players a lot more than it might seem since all of the ones that don't require you to build a deck put everyone on equal ground (RNG not withstanding) since it's easier to do daily quests and grind wins that way than it is to build a deck and play ladder against one of the four popular netdecks of the time.
hearthstone,3e1mso,davidhughhadden,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:16 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm hoping that the next card packs will make the game less pay to win. For example, if they release a new 5 mana taunt that is a reasonable alternative to sludge belcher, a new player can craft that instead of buying naxx. I really like the adventures, but I definitely think they are the cause of the pay to win problem."
hearthstone,3e1mso,CaptainJacket,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:03:52 2015 UTC,"I'll add my two cents as well.  My decks are modified Sheng's. I play casually, and try to complete a quest a day (generally I reroll any 40, but when I'm time stressed , a 40 quest is preffered; if i can complete it while progressing a 60/100 quest - even better).  I have all of Naxx, and currently saving for the first BRM wing. My gold spending cycle is Classic Pack -> Arena ticket -> Wing.  My arena runs are few, but since I don't play a lot, they last a while. I unlock a wing every two weeks or so, and it's a good pacing for my play style."
hearthstone,3e1mso,Shadowofthedragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:22:34 2015 UTC,"If someone played a lot (not an extreme amount but a lot) they could earn a 100 gold a day through the 10 gold per 3 wins and daily quests, that would mean it would take just over a month to get an expansion. Even half that would just take 2 months per expansion, and if someone just went for the 6 wings I specified in my previous comment that cuts down on a lot of time."

hearthstone,3e1mso,sober_1,18,Tue Jul 21 15:16:47 2015 UTC,tfw no naxx or brm
hearthstone,3e1mso,stonekeep,7,Tue Jul 21 10:38:22 2015 UTC,"Spending 3.5k gold on Naxx is on average worth much more than 35 packs. The Naxx provides a lot of staple cards that are still used in most of the decks.  With the BRM it's a little different, depending on what you want to play. Only first wing if you want the Grim Patron (for Patron Warrior) and Emperor Thaurissan (for a lot of combo/control decks). Quick Shot is also a nice addition to any Hunter deck. Second wing if you want to play Zoo Warlock - Imp Gang Boss. Fourth wing if you want to play Tempo Mage (Flamewaker), Midrange Shaman (Fireguard Destroyer) or just want a solid Legendary for your slower decks (Chrommagus). The problem is that it requires unlocking the 3rd wing, which is almost useless.   But generally, if I was a new player, I'd focus on unlocking Naxx and wing 1 of BRM first, then get some packs, then maybe unlock some more wings of BRM."
hearthstone,3e1mso,Houndoomsday,4,Tue Jul 21 12:29:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you can afford to put down $25 on Naxx, I would do so. It's a lot more gold efficient afaik and you get some guaranteed great cards. But, saving up 700 gold for the first wing of BRM is the way to go imo, as that shouldn't take longer than 2 weeks."

hearthstone,3e1mso,danhakimi,-4,Tue Jul 21 15:40:54 2015 UTC,"work with the players Blizzard matches you with.   Hahaha... Wait are you serious? Unless you play casual and chain concede, you won't be playing against people with the same basic decks you are forced to play, you still get stomped by people with real decks and the only chance is that they are terrible at the game.   I had to play for like 3 months on and off (because getting destroyed is not fun) basic decks with some rares at best until I could get naxx and craft face hunter. In between I was playing incomplete decks or upgraded versions of basic decks.   Watching how if they dropped some naxx cards you were already screwed (and how so many decks had doctor boom who would win them the game at turn 7 against cheap basic decks), because you can't deal with them unless you use several cards."

hearthstone,3e1mso,gumboshrimps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:27 2015 UTC,"Not, what annoyed me was that I had to play against full meta decks since the start. MMR works to get a 50-50 in the long run, but that's only true if players actually played the game mode before. So casual is a cluster fuck of different skill levels because not everyone plays casual until they get to their mmr level. Ranked does not even take mmr like that."

I have an EU F2P account that I started somewhat recently and the game definitely puts you up against other beginner accounts at first. Secondly if you aren't playing casual enough to get an average MMR why does it bother you at all? Finally, ranked doesn't need MMR because it's the same situation as higher MMR casual play. Outside of portrait farmers if you are facing these sort of decks then you are generally playing something that is on the same level as them. Just because you don't have a whole heap of legendaries in your collection doesn't stop aggro decks being efficient enough for you to be up against more expensive decks."
hearthstone,3e1mso,legenj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:26 2015 UTC,"I started playing when the game launched on phones a few months ago. I did all the ""secret quests"" in a day, bought packs with the gold, dusted and crafted a few cards, and built a beast hunter deck outlined by this very OP. I did fine in ranked and casual until about rank 15. I don't think you are a reliable source on why you were losing when you first started playing."
hearthstone,3e1mso,byanyothernombre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:33 2015 UTC,"I got to rank 10 using the basic decks made by OP , I played mostly the mage version with some rares added.

But I had no idea such sites existed when I started playing, the only friend I had in the game was in my same situation playing basic decks against netdecks.  Just because you are winning enough times to climb to 15 does not prove anything, which is not hard at all if you bother to climb (which there is no point anyway because you don't get anything for it)."

hearthstone,3e1mso,Shadowofthedragon,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:00:54 2015 UTC,thats why hes done a basic only deck list as well and for most people it'd be a balance between the two as you might buy the adventures and earn the gold for packs through daily quests or a mixture (like i did) of buying some wings and grinding some.  At the end of the day some of the adventure cards are really nice but none of them are so integral that you can't make a winning deck without them. (although i'd advise everyone to get the first wing of brm)

hearthstone,3e1mso,alabomb,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:08:32 2015 UTC,1000 dust is 10 packs. New players have many opportunities for packs and gold.
hearthstone,3e1mso,Shadowofthedragon,5,Tue Jul 21 13:48:55 2015 UTC,"10 packs is 1000 gold. 1000 dust is closer to 25 packs assuming you're getting 40 dust/pack (1 rare, 4 commons)."
hearthstone,3e1mso,alabomb,5,Tue Jul 21 14:27:37 2015 UTC,"No, the mode of packs is 40 dust, but the mean dust for packs is 100 dust or slightly higher but with a huge variance from Goldens and legendaries. To the point where 10 packs probably won't give you that, and you won't want to disenchant cards at first because they aren't duplicates."
hearthstone,3e1mso,Shadowofthedragon,3,Tue Jul 21 14:39:29 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that only be relevant over a larger sample size of packs? If you're trying to get 1000 dust as cheap as possible seems more practical to just assume you'll be getting ~40 dust/pack.
hearthstone,3e1mso,RossAM,3,Tue Jul 21 15:17:54 2015 UTC,What would also be relevant then is that new players shouldn't disenchant cards unless they are duplicates most of the time.
hearthstone,3e1mso,Shadowofthedragon,2,Tue Jul 21 15:41:27 2015 UTC,"Actually, 10 packs probably will give you 1000 dust, since that is the mean. I am only kidding though, because you are absolutely right that they won't be duplicates and a new player wouldn't want to disenchant these."

hearthstone,3e1mso,seVan80,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:03:18 2015 UTC,"When they drop the new expansion, it's quite likely that Arena will switch to awarding the latest packs (it's been awarding GvG ones since they came out) while I suspect Tavern Brawl and Spectate a Friend quests will continue giving Basic packs.  If anything, you're joining right before the meta will start fluctuating. If you hoard your dust a bit, you could easily see the new ideal budget decks and start work on them right away, while older players like me will still be running more-or-less outdated decks.  Either way, don't worry about it too much. If you're having trouble getting wins with the cards you have, Tavern Brawls can be pretty good for them, and Arena drafting is a fast, fun way to learn the game."
hearthstone,3e1mso,Aalnius,7,Tue Jul 21 12:55:03 2015 UTC,"Basically, the best common card for beginners is Piloted Shredder, right? I have a friend looking to get into HS, and I was wondering which cards he should begin to craft with if he hasn't tried all the classes yet"
hearthstone,3e1mso,Rickuyi,17,Tue Jul 21 08:09:43 2015 UTC,I personally don't recommend crafting common cards since it's very likely to get them from opening packs. I got the Shredders after opening 20 packs or something like that. It's smarter to save the dust for bigger cards.
hearthstone,3e1mso,scadgrad1,5,Tue Jul 21 08:24:12 2015 UTC,for starters crafting 5-6x 50 dust cards that help them to earn the first 20-25 pack is good
hearthstone,3e1mso,Yakghanistan,3,Tue Jul 21 09:35:39 2015 UTC,i rarely craft unless its something i really need for a deck i really want to play (like the oracles for mill rogue) but recently i decided to craft acolytes of pain because they seem pretty useful and i hadn't managed to drop any and a week later i get 2 from the same pack.  its pretty annoying tbh
hearthstone,3e1mso,Muscufdp,6,Tue Jul 21 11:25:40 2015 UTC,"Not at all, 4 mana cards are the most OP in the basic set. Great neutral minions, some great class minions and spells. 4 mana cards are probably the least priority to craft unless you are going for something specific."

I think new players would probably be wise to craft Shredders, Lepers, Knife Jugglers and probably Savannah Highmane within the first week or so of play. I know folks hate Hunter, but as a brand new player, I think that along with Mage, it's still the way to go."

hearthstone,3e1mso,Aalnius,0,Tue Jul 21 16:53:01 2015 UTC,"While your guides are well done, I really dislike the use of later wing cards in Naxx and BRM. For example, your Tempo mage deck uses flamewaker. Flamewaker is wing 4 of BRM, and BRM has nothing good to offer in wings 2 and 3. For a new player to grind up 2800 gold and funnel that directly into BRM...they won't have anything else to make a deck.  In general I suspect players alternate between picking up packs and going to adventures. For new players, farming up 2800 gold takes a long time. Remember you make on average 70 gold a day, so to get flamewaker it takes a player about 40 days of straight playing. They cannot spend their gold on Arena, on packs, on anything that is not BRM. A lot of players won't want to do that, but the problem is the decks you have use cards from that.  To look at it another way, the average dust from a pack is 50ish. For the cost of 3 wings, you can make every single deck you have on offer if you only include the dust price. Its very misleading to offer the deck guides without account for how expensive adventures are for new players who aren't spending money on the game. Your budget patron seems really easy to make at 760 dust, but then you realize you need to get access to 5 different wings(Wing 1 BRM, Wings 1-4 Naxx). It costs 1400 gold for the dust, but it costs 4200 gold to gain access to the wings, making the deck far, far, far harder to access than it seems initially."

hearthstone,3e1mso,BSeeD,9,Tue Jul 21 09:22:45 2015 UTC,I totally second prioritizing adventure wings over packs for new players. The first wings of both Naxx and BRM are pure gold. And spending the extra 2100 gold to get to Naxx wing 4 is also totally worth IMO.
hearthstone,3e1mso,N0V0w3ls,2,Tue Jul 21 09:17:31 2015 UTC,"Have you tried it as a new player? It's just not fun. It takes 10 days of playing every day, and for most people it takes 2 weeks to get an adventure. These are new players for whom packs are often introducing new cards to them. And they have to hold off for weeks to be able to make OPs decks. That patron deck I mentioned? Most casual players would have to not buy a pack for close to 3 months to be able to afford that.  If you're a new player, and looking at guides for budget decks, and find out you need to save gold for 3 months, is that particularly helpful?  I was trying to show that only labeling the dust cost is disingenuous, that there is a very real and expensive gold cost with needing harder to unlock wings. Not listing that, but listing dust, makes the decks seem far easier to acquire than not."
hearthstone,3e1mso,Aalnius,2,Tue Jul 21 09:23:34 2015 UTC,meh ive been playing for something like 4-5 months now as a mostly f2p player and it isnt that bad tbh i grinded out most of the adventures with gold except for the last couple wings of brm.  I haven't bought packs except for a few when i got a free giftcard and im not in a bad shape for decks i mean yeh im missing key components of meta decks like inner rage or the giants but i work around it and find other stuff that i can make work.  I've been doing the heroic parts for the adventures and it is annoying when i see the key strategy for beating the boss is a card i dont have like mass dispel but i get over it pretty quickly.  edit: also i don't play everyday and when i do play i normally just complete a quest and leave it at that so it hasn't been 4-5 months of solid 12hr a day play more like 30 minutes a day

Having to play around this card every game is one of the main reasons why Mage is arguably the best class in Arena.   Lots say that Flamestrike should be a rare card, rather than basic. I used to wholeheartedly agree. However, with the new influx of many minions and few spells in to the game from GvG and BRM, I see Flamestrike pretty infrequently now. It has not been in my last 7 runs. Do others still think it should be changed from basic to rare? :)"

hearthstone,3e29eh,Starkheaven,36,Tue Jul 21 17:01:02 2015 UTC,"Ooooohhhhh boy, Flamestrike. Our favourite card in Arena. Totally the most balanced spell in the game, right...  ARENA  Alright, let's cut to the chase: Flamestrike is, not surprisingly, the best Mage common card in Arena, rated at 86 points in HearthArena. I don't think I need to explain why it's so good. Arena tends to go into the late-game, and by Turn 7, you know what's coming. Your board will suffer: small sized minions get wiped, medium sized minions may also get wiped, big-sized minions will get cleared if the Mage has some semblance of board. If on turn 7 the Mage has some part of the board and Flamestrikes, it's almost over.  But here's the thing: Flamestrike can be played around to some extent. Keep big-sized minions healthy if you read that she has no Polymorph. Never over-commit. /u/adwcta has a fantastic article as to how to play around it for more info.   Furthermore... here's the thing: Flamestrike is 7 mana, and doesn't put down anything on the board. So it is almost as if the Mage skips her turn to clear the board: albeit, it's a very very effective clear, but it's sometimes, you can just refill, and sometimes, the Mage may not have the board to deal with your stuff, and then, you have the initiative again.   To be honest, I think Flamestrike isn't as good as say, Fireball. Now that shit's broken. Flamestrike is obviously spectacular, but I don't honestly think it's broken. Some amazing Arena players pride themselves in skipping Flamestrike if they see that it doesn't fit in their deck: and this case isn't uncommon! Sometimes you just want a pure Tempo deck that can't afford to slow down, because it's playing for the early board that can't afford to slow down.   So yes, we all know Flamestrike is good. We all know that it fits into a Midrange/Control deck (aka most Mage decks) in Arena perfectly. But Flamestrike's just anti-tempo, which may be a huge win-con for a deck... which is why it's not 130 points, and why sometimes, you pick Piloted Shredder or even Zombie Chow over it sometimes :P  CONSTRUCTED  The builds of Mage that are aggressive don't need Flamestrike, for obvious reasons, so Mech Mage and Tempo Aggro Mage omit it. Even for decks like Tempo Midrange Mage... they only put 1 copy if at all, because Flamestrike is just that anti-tempo. Of course, it's an include in Freeze Mage, but of course it is, because Freeze Mage thrives on the powerful clear that it provides.   And that's just how Flamestrike is, outside the Arena meta in which minion combat is so prevalent. Obviously in a meta in which the board position is more important (Arena), Flamestrike's pretty excellent, but for the current ranked decks? You've either already died by then (Turn 7 Lethal? Yup!), or will barely scratch the surface or an already sticky board... or will be irrelevant in the control match-up that thrives on putting huge things that survive it anyway. And to top it off, only the control Mage decks really use it as part of their game plan. So Flamestrike's not really that defining of a Mage card outside of Arena.  Fireball on the other hand..."
hearthstone,3e29eh,__Avaritia,9,Tue Jul 21 13:50:38 2015 UTC,"The minions were power crept, while AoEs weren't. That's part of the reason for face or combo decks prevalance - clearing and trading with deathrattle stuff is too hard."
hearthstone,3e29eh,kaybo999,3,Tue Jul 21 15:43:25 2015 UTC,"Once again, /u/__Avaritia has beaten me to the punch!  This is an excellent analysis of the card and I don't really have much to add in terms of how the card functions.  I would like to add something of a personal opinion, though.  I see many people in this thread calling for a nerf of Flamestrike or to make it a Rare card so that it is less common in Arena.  I rather strongly disagree.  I think that it is very important to have strong common value class-specific cards in Arena.  The reason is that this raises the overall skill ceiling for Arena players.  The ability to read an opponents hand and play around certain cards is one of the things that sets a good Arena player apart from a bad one.  There are a lot of subtle hints that can alert you to if a player is holding a board clear like Flamestrike.  You can watch their hand to see if they've been holding a certain card for a long time.  You can pay attentions to changes in the pace of your opponent's turn.  If they are playing very fast, then when you get two minions on the board they hesitate for a long time, mousing over their cards, you know that they are likely struggling with a decision.  Then of course, there are more obvious signs like pinging a minion down to 4 health.  In a game like Hearthstone where people complain about too much RNG deciding games, cards like Flamestrike allow one player to rise above another purely through their skill in reading and playing around such a card.  Every class has its own ""strongest"" common cards that good Arena players strive to identify and play around.  On the flip side, if you are the one with the Flamestrike, it's important to try avoid giving off these tells yourself.  Normally I try to take my turns slowly and really think them through all the way before playing something, but if it is a case of holding onto a Flamestrike against a smaller board, I try to play quickly so it seems like my decision is a no-brainer.  Also, really try to avoid those ""obvious setup"" hero powers that give away your intentions.    There is just one small thing I would like to add in regards to playing around Flamestrike and other board clears.  When most people start playing Arena, they don't play around anything.  They frequently over-commit the board and walk into the most devastating board clears.  As players get better, they start trying to play around these things, but sometimes they go too far and are afraid to even play more than 2 cards out at a time.  One concept that Kripparrian has addressed several times in his videos is that of Game State vs. Risk Management.  When you are very far ahead in a game, you can afford to play around every possible way of losing.  In this scenario, not only should you play around the common board clears like Flamestrike, but you should also try to play around less common swing cards like Mind Control Tech, or even Deathwing.  However, if you are desperately losing a game, sometimes you lose all luxury of playing around anything.  You just have to flood your board and pray.  Too often I see people who are behind on board against me holding back minions to play around Flamestrike.  Sometimes the reality is that if you play all your minions they might have Flamestrike and you will lose, but if you don't get all your minions out, you will definitely lose.  So it is always important to pay attention the state of the game in relation to how much you play around certain cards."
hearthstone,3e29eh,Kordyon,57,Tue Jul 21 17:01:08 2015 UTC,"Card Design   It's good it's a basic and not a rare or higher because it's a very straight forward board clear for beginners 7 mana is good because a turn later and you're often dead. A turn earlier and it's WAY too powerful 4 damage is good because it kills small things but can't quite take down that sludge belcher/loatheb/yeti/senjin With a single spell damage, it is able to kill all those things which encourages spell damage minions (something I would personally like to see more of) Awesome animation   Constructed   It's balanced and in a good position. Effective against midrange decks, aggro decks (provided you have at least some health or ice barrier/block active).  Ineffective against: Nerubian egg, sludge belcher, loatheb, big shades of naxxramas, sticky minions, face decks (because you spend your entire turn on a spell that puts down no minions and doesn't heal you)   Arena   Half of it's strength comes from people playing around it even when they shouldn't be. It's a basic, so you have it quite a lot, but you don't always have it, and care should be taken when to play around it and when not to. This is the issue though. It's simple to use, but difficult to play against. I personally know how to play around it and when playing against mage in arena, I start setting up bad flamestrikeable boards maybe 3 turns in advance. So by turn 4 I'm already making plays that mean a turn 7 flamestrike might leave me with two 4/1s (two yetis) or have 2-3 sticky minions (divine shield/deathrattle: summon). Flamestrike isn't unstoppable. But it's DIFFICULT to stop. And the fact that it's SIMPLE to use mean this is a bad characteristic. For example, big damage minions (giants, dragons, boom, etc) are simple to use. Step 1: Put it in your deck. Step 2: Draw it. Step 3: Summon it. They are also simply to counter. Big game hunter, or hard removal spells (shadow word: death, assassinate, hunter's mark, etc). Simple tactic countered by simple tactic. Then you get difficult tactic countered by difficult tactic, e.g. freeze mage being countered by playing strategically and saving kezan for final moment. But flamestrike is simple tactic countered by difficult tactic, because it takes quite some skill to counter it. To follow up on the previous point, STICKIER boards. Perhaps more anti-spell cards. It would be cool to have a (neutral common) 4/6 for 5 mana which reads ""ALL spells cost 1 more"". Something like that. MORE counters to the whole ""flamestrike is OP in arena"" is deck archtype. The most common arena deck is midrange/value, whereas I tend to go for aggressive decks (I'm an infinite player) and I don't find mages very difficult at all because my playstyle is the paper to their rock. The issue is that arena aggro takes a lot more skill (compared to constructed aggro taking less skill) because you gotta be able to be aggro enough to do the whole 30 damage, and if you fail, you often wipeout at 20 damage or 25 damage and are unable to kill them. This means you gotta draft carefully and play carefully. The issue isn't the strength of flamestrike, but the skill required to counter it. In a hearthstone where everyone is experienced, flamestrike isn't too overpowered (it still is a little bit), but people aren't, and flamestrike is too common and too simple to use effectively for counters that are so complicated and difficult to pull off."

I feel that flame strike, fireball and frost bolt (I fucking hate that card, 3 damage for 2 mana AND a freeze. OP af)    Also I usually struggle in the late game, so any general tips for that? I make sure to get 4-5 big minions for the lategame, but just can't seem to keep up overall. Any help help is appreciated, thank you."

hearthstone,3e29eh,TheHelpfulGuy,3,Tue Jul 21 15:47:01 2015 UTC,"This card is one of the most important cards in the Basic set, in my opinion. Given to what can for all intents and purposes be considered the ""tutorial"" class, Flamestrike teaches the value of slow cards with high ROI when played at the right moment, which is a crucially important engaging concept in card games.   Plus, this card is pretty easy to design around. Over the two adventures and expansion, many, many cards have been created as a soft counter to AOE including the Deathrattle minions, the Eggs, etc. So not only does this card help balance the game: it also helps the designers EXPAND players' thought processes behind the game.  Overall, this card is pretty balanced, and will have its place in the foreseeable future in certain deck types."
hearthstone,3e29eh,keenfrizzle,9,Tue Jul 21 14:51:54 2015 UTC,I guess it`s OK in arena

hearthstone,3e29eh,Mike737,4,Tue Jul 21 13:01:04 2015 UTC,"It's not just because of Flamestrike. It's because all of Mage's basics are amazing. Water Elemental, Fireball, Frostbolt, Flamestrike, SorcApprentice, etc. The hero power is amazing due to flexibility and it makes some average cards like Acolyte/Amani into really good cards."

Next turn you have no option to drop more to counter, and then you get hit with it. Flamestrike is a huge tempo swing in arena, case closed. There is a reason Mage is such a dominant class."
hearthstone,3e29eh,darkesth0ur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:18:03 2015 UTC,"True, but it does not make it less fun or interesting. With the diluted card pool, mages nowadays often only have 1 flamestrike, or don't even draw it before losing. But I agree that having 2-3 flamestrikes dropped on you in the same game is frustrating."
hearthstone,3e29eh,mrbrown0891,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:37 2015 UTC,It's getting better with larger card pools I agree. But it wouldn't be the first time I draft six flamestrikes
hearthstone,3e29eh,darkesth0ur,5,Tue Jul 21 17:27:01 2015 UTC,"Why does this card and the other AOE spells not do face damage? What's so special about concecrate, explosive trap, holy nova, etc. that they get that little bit of extra damage in, but arcane explosion, flamestrike, lightning storm, etc. don't?   I actually think flamestrike is fine where it is, but I don't really know why some AOEs do face damage and others don't."
hearthstone,3e29eh,Mitts88,12,Tue Jul 21 13:38:05 2015 UTC,"The AoEs that do face damage tend to be slightly overcosted in terms of resources (mana cost, additional resources, etc.).  So for example, the theory is that being able to use LS on T3 against aggro is better than having to wait until T4 for consecration for a similar amount of board damage. Because you need to wait an extra turn, they decided to throw in consecration hitting the face as well. Although I think the way it makes more sense is that since LS is played earlier, you don't get to have face damage.  Comparing Blade Flurry and Arcane Explosion, both cost the same amount of mana, but since BF needs a weapon, you need to invest an additional resource so you get to have some face damage thrown in."
hearthstone,3e29eh,mymindpsychee,6,Tue Jul 21 14:09:30 2015 UTC,"Mage is a class that has a various sources of face damage : fireball , frostbolt , pyroblast giving mage another form of damage that also clears makes mages even more powerful and I think it would make them little too strong in both arena and constructed ."
hearthstone,3e29eh,Macieyerk,5,Tue Jul 21 14:08:15 2015 UTC,"Well a part of it might be that the classes that don't do face damage with their AOE spells tend to have a lot of reach through other spells as well. Consecrate and holy nova get to hit face because paladin and priest (unless you play some crazy velen+mindblast combodeck) don't really have that much reach out of hand, even hunter has a lot fewer good spells that hit face than shaman or mage, though druid feels slightly out of synch here because of the combo and starfire (which is great in budget decks), but then again the combo isn't direct damage. As for hellfire, hitting everything feels very thematically appropriate for the warlock."
hearthstone,3e29eh,grimmlingur,2,Tue Jul 21 14:08:38 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing it has something to do with the amount of face damage AOE spell cards like consecrate, explosive trap, and holy nova can do. 2 face damage really isn't that much, classes like warrior can armor up and priests can spend a turn healing themselves. However, 4 face damage from a flamestrike? That's scary, especially considering the amount of direct damage spells the mage class already has. It looks like blizzard decided the cutoff for AOE spell face damage should be 2, anymore could be overpowered.   Edit: Forgot to mention hellfire. Hellfire damages everything, so it's not like the other AOE spells."
hearthstone,3e29eh,JellyOnMyToast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:15:57 2015 UTC,What about arcane explosion then? That one is just one damage to enemy minions for 2.
hearthstone,3e29eh,Mitts88,2,Tue Jul 21 15:25:56 2015 UTC,"3 damage to all enemies (& face) would still be alright, but 4 is what helps you clear 80% of minions and on Turn 9 you can clear most and ping the one that lives or the deathrattle that pops."
hearthstone,3e29eh,havek23,5,Tue Jul 21 15:13:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good card, especially against bad players that overextend and play a bunch of small minions on turn 6. I barely see it in ranked anymore though, unless I'm against Freeze Mage, which isn't that common anyway."

hearthstone,3e29eh,ssnider23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:32:13 2015 UTC,"Great card in arena, pretty good in constructed too.  There's some downsides to it that are often over looked. It's such a slow card that against smart players that don't overextend it's hard to get good value because casting a 7 mana spell is such a tempo loss. Not to mention the amount of sticky deathrattles that will leave stuff on the board.  It's often suggested that it should be a rare because of arena but I feel this problem will solve itself over time. Mage (and paladin) have insanely good basic/common cards but the pool of good basics will get diluted with mediocre stuff like Gnomeregan Infantry and such when more cards are released."

A great turn 5 or 6 can keep the mage from using flamestrike solely based on a healthy board.

They'll try to get as MUCH value as humanly possible out of their hero power/Skillstrike, even if it means hero powering the first 3 turns and losing massive tempo, because they have their turn 7 trump card.

No one would actually talk like that, and no one would persist for a few months, because nobody actually cares that much. ""ass bitch im at work"", is the modern swearing meta to just list random insults the OP flamer is thinking up on the spot, with no logical coherence? You'd've thought that the flamer would have been a little bit more structured or interesting if they had been doing it for months. I don't know why this shit is allowed, its content isn't even related to Hearthstone except that it happens to be within the game, and it's not even remotely funny -- at least the ""roach boy"" one, while even more obviously fake, was at least slightly amusing."
hearthstone,3e0rb9,MrPayDay,13,Tue Jul 21 09:36:23 2015 UTC,"Between 1999 and 2003 I was playing Unreal Tournament on an esports level. Back in the day, we were playing public deathmatch servers here and there and it usually ended with 30-1 or 30-2 for me. The hate some sore losers developed because they died in online fps games, is hilarious. I was flamed and threatend, they gave me very creative names like ""mr.gayday"" or ""mr. cheatday""  and kept on stalking me when I was playing pub games.  Between 2010 and 2014 I was not really ""playing"" WoW anymore but camping the Auctionhouse 1-8 hours per day. That meant undercutting the opponents within 60-150 seconds. Even tho this was neither a fps game nor wow pvp, I got insulted, flamed and  threatened so often - again - that I posted screenshots of the chats in our guild facebook group for entertainment.  I had not only one but several guys who I undercut, and they would not shut up, some dudes even created a horde char so they could kill or gank me the few moments I was not in he AH.   They were still angry several weeks and months later That I would ""deny"" selling their stuff.  Edit: Oh, I forgot that I got several insults after Hearthstone games as well. I have mostly golden cards but play gimmick decks between rank 20 and 10. ""omfg you fucking lamer. rank 17 with golden legendariews, l2p the game you fuckhead"" is a pattern of replies here and there.  You underestimate the number of freaks who take games really serious and personal."
hearthstone,3e0rb9,GeneralArgument,3,Tue Jul 21 14:25:04 2015 UTC,"I can see people being dedicated to insulting someone for that kind of thing, because, as you said, you were doing it for 1-8 hours per day for years; of course people are gonna keep on telling you to fuck off. Losing a Hearthstone game is a one-time issue which nobody cares about that much because it's a casual game. People take games like WoW and Unreal seriously because they're major and hardcore games, and people have an invested interest in every match the play, or in the gold that they earn. Hearthstone isn't like that. Also, if the flamer exists as OP would like us to believe, how do you think he has the time to message every single person he gets mad about? Or does OP just happen to be the 'lucky' exception who gets the crazy one for months?  EDIT: RE: your edit; I, too, have been flamed by people who play Hearthstone, and majorly, but it would never persist for months. Maybe a few days or a week at most, and I'm not denying that flamers exist. But not only is this obviously faked/set-up, it's unbelievable that someone would continue to insult someone for months over one game."
hearthstone,3e0rb9,itonlygetsworse,4,Tue Jul 21 06:05:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry, mate, but Hearthstone already is a ""professional"" game, at least for a minority of streamers and tournament players who can live from the subs, prize money and sponsorships/advertising.  OP mentioned that it was a priest game. I got most flames after priest games as well, followed by face rush decks (reynads warrior in beta, charge and spell mage early 2014 and of course face hunter since ever). The priest games can be frustrating when the priest draws the nuts and even steals ""your"" cards. I got 30-0 games with the ""yours is mine!""-Priest-Deck that some youtuber shared here several months ago. The rage-addfried-reactions were sometimes funny, sometimes even sad.  I learnt that my mother had several sexual interactions with gentlemen of color from the beautiful continent of africa; there were even insults like ""i hope you die to cancer, you would have be gassed 60 years ago"" (while telling me that the ""insulter"" has - of course - well paid fulltime job and would not suck at life like me) were the ones I finally reported.  If you climb the ladder, Hearthstone feels hardcore after some hours.  If you grind to legend, Hearthstone finally becomes Hardcore.  After a losing streak some people just need one little bit of ""too much to take"", maybe a loss against a steal-priest, and it is just on, and they are venting and hating life and you, the one who beat them, will face a virtual Mohammend Sissoko. Read the FUT15 Player Review for reference.  http://www.futhead.com/15/reviews/4038/  And I can second the expercience OP made. This was not an exception. Luckily, persistent flames who hate losing in games are rare, and this is okay."

hearthstone,3e2opy,DrMashine,8,Tue Jul 21 15:59:09 2015 UTC,"I'm on the same boat.   How I do it:   Save dailies for 3 days until it's full. Re-roll Quests if needed, to see if I can get some matching pairs in 'class wins needed' or the optional ones like spectating and those other ones that are not class specific. Then, I play them all in brawl.   And after that I don't play for another 3 days until full on dailies again.   Hopefully, tomorrows announcement, there will be some drastic changes to change that for me."

hearthstone,3e2opy,Chesterbobby,0,Tue Jul 21 19:06:03 2015 UTC,"Apparently this got removed... Here's a tip if you ever get behind more than 3 days:  There is a hidden queue of daily quests that builds up up to 3 quests long after you have already gotten your 3rd quest. These will start to appear after you clear your current quests. BUT, if you re-roll any quest while you have quests in this hidden queue, the hidden queue disappears entirely. So if you haven't played for 6 days, don't touch that re-roll until you have cleared 3 quests, because you should get 3 more!"

It wasn't till yesterday where I actually managed to get enough dust/cards to actually craft the good legendaries everyone needs (Dr. Boom, Sylvannas, Ragnaros) and that was only after throwing 200+ dollars at the game for the adventures and packs.  Besides a couple of lucky finds (Harrison, Black Knight, Ysera) I've found a whole lot of shit (my first legendary was Captain Greenskin...) and I'm still missing relatively huge staple cards like most giants, preparation, other core legendaries for other decks, and some basic rares that I'm not going to craft because there's a high chance I'll just get it from a pack (like Violet Teacher or A. Soul Priest).  Tavern Brawl has become the best thing ever for me. I can beat my dailies easily AND since it's fun I usually play the brawl a lot and get a ton of wins adding to how much gold I can get a day."

He specifically said he doesn't like ladder because it's 90% aggro(partially true) and 99% patron warrior from rank 5-legend(not true). So yes, actually his reasoning was that he doesn't like playing against certain decks or styles of decks"

And when I say 99% I don't mean it's 99%, but the majority of matchups have been vs patron warrior for, yet again, ME. And yes, I don't like to ladder because of that. Getting 1-2 joyfull decks/matchups to go up against in 10 games aint my cup of fun. So there you have it."

hearthstone,3e2opy,LSDemon,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:07 2015 UTC,"Again, why?    If you are trying to learn so you can improve your rank, play on ranked so you learn to play against actual decks you'll face.    Casual isn't pre-ranked. If you have a netdeck that is proven effective, take it in ranked and learn the nuances of it. If you are working on a brand new homebrew you might be able to justify casual, but likely just better off going into ranked.    If it causes you to fall too far then you probably shouldn't play the deck."
hearthstone,3e2opy,aloehart,2,Tue Jul 21 17:46:40 2015 UTC,"Not sure what rank you usually play at, but I'm not a big fan of giving away stars to learn whatever the new hotness net deck is. If I'm facing a new deck a bunch on ladder, I'll play a few games on casual with it to figure out how to play against it. I've won enough on casual that I usually go against other top-tier decks while doing so, so it's a great learning/practicing tool. Not sure what you're so against about that."
hearthstone,3e2opy,LSDemon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:46 2015 UTC,"If you're rank 5 or better, you shouldn't be experimenting unless there's been a meta shift or a nerf to your chosen climbing deck. You don't see people taking experimental decks to major tournaments because untested decks should be played in a place to test them, not in a place where your win/loss matters.    If you aren't rank 5 then your stars are irrelevant and quickly earned back. If you've played against the new hotness then you should have a general idea. If you are netdecking then chances are the place you got the deck from has a break down. If you have those resources and take more than a few games to reach a decent win/loss then you shouldn't be playing the deck. Any deck big enough to be seen at high level meta is going to have countless guides and builds to tell you how to play it.    Casual mode is meant for people to play for fun, not to practice for ranked. If you can't win with the deck unless you're facing weaker players/decks, then you shouldn't be playing the deck.    What good does it do to take your new deck against control rogue, aggro priest, deathrattle mage, etc, etc, etc? If you aren't going to face it in the meta then you aren't learning enough to matter."

You start to figure out the types of plays the deck tries to set up, as well as the counter-plays that work well against it. When I started to see only patron warrior, the best way I learned how to beat it was to play it a lot. But I sure as hell wasn't going to play my first patron warrior game at rank 2 on ladder.   Why would you take a high level deck into a mode intended for casual/fun decks to practice for playing against competitive decks.

If we get right down to it, unless you are aiming for high legend, there's no reason to play ranked outside of wanting to face meta decks or trying to get your card back.

hearthstone,3e2haw,Solenus,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:38 2015 UTC,"Only problem is that it is only slightly better than shadow madness, and 2 mana more. Also, if it only targets minions with 3 or less attack, there's a good chance that the -1 health, and especially the -2 health, will kill the character.

hearthstone,3e2haw,Divolinon,2,Tue Jul 21 14:00:30 2015 UTC,"Its a tempo loss, but its also one of those cards that can't have great synergy with your deck.  Having the heal is guaranteed every game, so getting large HP minions works well with priest.  If you want to go shadowform for face you can't rely on drawing that card. You lose your synergy to heal large minions and card draw from northshire cleric, etc.  It would be more interesting if they maybe had a secondary hero power tree which took up your turn and allowed you to enter shadowform.  I'm sure this would cause all kind of balancing issues without a lot more thinking, but it would play on the theme of the heroes having different skill trees in wow to choose from.  Being able to select alternate, weaker ""skill tree"" type abilities at the beginning of the game could add a lot more flavor to the heroes.  The hero cards would probably not synergize as well with alternate skills, but if you played WoW in the earlier days you know that every warrior (best tank), NO MATTER WHAT, wanted to DPS even if they were terrible at it.  Priests always jumped at the chance to shadowform and lower red bars instead of raise green bars (IMO as a rogue main, healing was actually much more satisfying and rewarding on a consistent basis).  Stupid other ideas: Mage - Freeze a single minion and deal no damage  Paladin - Give a minion +1 hp  Warrior - shield to reduce all incoming damage by 1 next turn (but lose ability to gain armor)  Shaman - chain heal two random minions for 1 each"
hearthstone,3e2haw,swordfishy,2,Tue Jul 21 14:12:31 2015 UTC,When I first started playing I played shadowform and kept hitting myself for two damage and thought it was the worst card ever!

hearthstone,3e2haw,SorteKanin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:53 2015 UTC,"Priest cards should be revamped so Shadow/Light form are toggled seamlessly when playing certain cards. That would be badass... but hard to balance, I guess.  E.g. playing Soulpriest toggles from Light to Shadowform, but playing another one reverses it. Have a bunch of cards like this and  you'd have a sick mechanic"
hearthstone,3e2haw,SplitMyInfinitive,0,Tue Jul 21 16:07:03 2015 UTC,"While it may seem a good idea to create cards that have alternative forms based on Shadowform, you forget that Hearthstone cards in general need to be somewhat playable without a prerequisite.  For example, if you had a 3 mana 2/2 with +2/+2 if Shadowform is active then it simply would not be played due to the reliance on Shadowform.  I don't think we will ever see a change to the card, but there could be future cards that may compensate Priests for the loss of tempo in playing a Shadowform card early. As an example, a 2 mana 2/2 with 'Whenever you cast a spell, deal 2 damage to a random enemy minion and to your hero'. This sets up nicely for a turn 3 Shadowform, but again is pretty niche. I'm just trying to think of a sitaution where a Priest can play Shadowform early. Maybe it's more of a meta thing."

Light of the Naaru, then a solid shadowform deck might be possible."

hearthstone,3e2haw,Bonk_EU,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:04:40 2015 UTC,I have a suggestion for blizzard. Priest is not good in the meta. I suggest you start stuffing priest with overpowered cards like Cabal or Shadow maddness. When this doesnt work try forcing an aggro priest so Noxious has something to do with his spare time. when this doesnt work out for the class make their overpowered shit even more overpowered so wont feel bad that its not in the meta.
hearthstone,3e2haw,SecretlyIlluminaty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:06:35 2015 UTC,"Of course it's a tempo loss, what else do you guys expect? Sure, you forfeit healing, but you gain a crazy powerful Hero Power for the remainder of the match, that can even be buffed up again later.   Shadowform just has the same issue so many other slow cards have. It doesn't fit in a more aggressive meta that easily. If you can get the ball rolling it's great, but it simply lacks consistency. It also doesn't do particularly well vs Combo decks because it's designed to control the board better in the early-mid game. Board control isn't something combo decks are overly concerned with so it becomes redundant, and the loss of healing means you're only getting in range of their combo quicker."
hearthstone,3e2haw,Snogreino,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:09:58 2015 UTC,"The main issue is the game is heavily centered around minions, which means it lends itself to aggressive gameplay. Hearthstone as a game is generally designed to be a battlefield of minions, so avoiding a buff to a weak card on the grounds that it doesn't work in an aggressive meta might be a wasted point."

hearthstone,3e2die,Jaegerr11,31,Tue Jul 21 12:44:35 2015 UTC,"You bring good points and I agree, it's definitely frothing and battle-rage that's the issue. While I also think patrons are hard to play around because you get punished for putting minions on the board (akin to the earlier problems of Unleash the Hounds), I guess that's all right. The main card which needs nerfing is battle rage, I think. Drawing that much for 2 mana is just insane."
hearthstone,3e2die,SorteKanin,4,Tue Jul 21 13:06:20 2015 UTC,"Playing around patrons is at least less ridiculous than playing around frothing in its current state, though.  Playing around patrons just means that if you want to have 1 or 2 attack minions on the board then they need to be behind taunt or you need to have a 3+ damage AoE spell ready to go.  2 attack minions aren't even that big of a deal, since the patron that attacks into a 2 attack minion will only have 1 health left and will be unable to continue spawning more patrons with whirlwind effects, then it dies to AoE the next turn anyway.    Frothing, on the other hand, requires you to keep a pretty ridiculous taunt wall (executes are practically free on a frothing turn) or to keep your number of minions super low—but if you only have a couple of big minions out then execute comes out to bite you.  Going with no minions and a spell-based approach is also unfeasible since warrior is the class best able to counter that style."

The only other thing it would affect is OTK decks based on Raging Worgen, which often use Charge instead anyways.   edit: To further the point, the problem with PW is that it's a combo deck that bends the rules. A combo deck should have 1-2 tries to pull off the game winning combo. That's it. Do your thing, draw a full hand, but you get one, maybe two shots to win. Screw those up, you're done. No more win conditions. That's why combo decks like MalyShaman didn't last for long on ladder. They are very unforgiving because there's a strict win condition.   PW has essentially 2 win conditions, both the Patrons and the Berserkers, AND a mechanic to almost completely refill hand and try again if one combo attempt doesn't work. This change to Battle Rage would help tremendously. Though it is still a healthy bit of draw to build up to your first win condition, it removes the refill aspect, making it EXTREMELY difficult to reach your 2nd win condition if the first one doesn't work."
hearthstone,3e2die,Aaron_Lecon,4,Tue Jul 21 18:12:30 2015 UTC,"If you recognize one of them as something you said, don't comment on this thread   Well I didn't, so here go mine: (these are seperate suggestions, and should be considered individually)    Nerf Thaurrissan to a 4,4 so that   it shares the stats of Gadgetsan Auctioneer (which is arguably a weaker card since its ability takes set up to use properly) It has ""dwarf stats"" (notice how 4 attack is very common among dwarf cards) Makes Argent Commander and Cairne more relevant It would still be played even with these stats; it's just too powerful. Unfortunately nerfs priests; a regretable side effect [although really what priest needs is a better way of dealing with 4 attack minions so that it doesn't get wrecked by shredders, etc.]     Introduce the following tech card: a 4 mana 3,2 divine shield; disable charge (epic rarity)   If you've played Patron warrior, you might note that without warsong commander (and hence without charge), patron warrior kindof falls flat; they can probably get a load of patrons but they won't get to do anything with them, so the opponent can probably AoE them away. Furthermore, they can't do frothing OTKs. As such, the patron warrior will want to kill off this anti-charge tech card very badly. Because of the divine shield, the warrior can't simply execute it; the Patron needs to spend significant ressources to deal with this card, which will weaken the combos quite a bit. The easiest way would be with firery win axe. If you hide it behind a Sludge Belcher, this improves its effectiveness even more since the weapons no longer work (that might even be gg, the same way that kezan mystic is often gg against freeze mage) It's not OP; it's silvermoon guardian with -1 health + situational ability which means it trades badly; you really want it for its ability It is useful against more than just Patron warrior; for example, you can use it as a pseudo-taunt against face hunter, druid combos, doomguard, Grommash or other finishers.  It's only 4 mana, so you can still use it effectively against face hunter and in the lategame it doesn't take your entire turn."
hearthstone,3e2die,cwh711,4,Tue Jul 21 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"To people who say ""Blizz killed X deck that I liked, they'd better kill Patron Warrior too"":  I'm really sorry your deck got nerfed into oblivion, and I wish Blizzard knew back then how to nerf responsibly.

Proposing nerfs to Patron Warrior that allow the deck to remain viable but not completely dominant will pave the way for better handling in the future."

What people raging about patron don't understand is that OTK decks have existed forever and its good for the game they exist. What's not ok is a deck that has answers for aggro, control, its own OTK, and is simply too consistent. I think making battle rage a 3 mana card will tone down patron warrior by a significant margin. Another potential nerf i thought of was making frothing a 3/2 meaning you could only use 1 whirlwind effect to charge patrons."
hearthstone,3e2die,lite951,2,Tue Jul 21 14:30:32 2015 UTC,OTK decks can be a good influence but Hearthstone needs more tools for dealing with them. The problem is that you cannot act on your opponents turn so you are forced to be safe every single turn. Meanwhile the OTK deck just needs one good turn and its over. The core of the problem is that if they add an anti-OTK minion or weapon the OTK deck can just deal with them before playing the OTK. It has to be a long lasting spell/battlecry that is hard to trigger. Ice Block is a very good example.
hearthstone,3e2die,PickIe_Chips,3,Tue Jul 21 16:49:09 2015 UTC,"But if Frothing was changed to a 3/2, wouldn't Warriors just add Commanding Shout again? It would still be the same problem.

hearthstone,3e2die,Nourek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:00 2015 UTC,Adding Commanding Shout to the combo makes it less consistent though.
hearthstone,3e2die,ehoney,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:24 2015 UTC,"Battle rage for 3 mana seems like a good idea. Comparing spells across classes is kinda apples to oranges, but I think it would line up nicely against arcane intellect. 1 card is almost guaranteed from hero damage, but you'll have the ability for extra value with smart board play.  GPW is strong but only needs some really small changes. Killing GPW would put warrior back to having only 1 expensive deck archetype meaning new players would have no viable way to play warrior."
hearthstone,3e2die,bashtonroar,6,Tue Jul 21 16:58:40 2015 UTC,"""Minions you control with 3 or less attack have charge"" is a terrible nerf, I agree.  It would completely kill the deck.  What people don't understand is that patron is accomplishing exactly what it should.  If you're mad about Warsong -> Patron -> Frothing -> Inner Rage -> Kill your Sludge Belcher -> Whirlwind, it's similar in my mind to being mad about a Paladin going Equality -> Consecrate.  Patrons are supposed to be able to wreck your board, and Frothings are supposed to be able to smash face for 10+.  The problem is speed and consistency, not the actual combos within.  You can't say ""oh just nerf Frothing to not deal 15 in a turn"" because thats what Frothing gets played for.  If Patron even needs a nerf, I'm a fan of the ""Emperor cannot reduce costs below 1"" idea.  Then again, I don't think Patron needs to be nerfed at all."
hearthstone,3e2die,mymindpsychee,4,Tue Jul 21 15:25:13 2015 UTC,"The problem with Grim Patron is that it fills the gap of Math Warrior too well. It serves as a ridiculous form of AoE, board development, and massive face damage all in 1 card. Math Warrior (with Frothing Berserker) was a Tier 2 deck at best because it didn't have a way to control the board as effectively and easily as other combo decks. Patron instantly solves that problem and now, suddenly, Patron Warrior has almost 0 weakness with some insanely good matchups."
hearthstone,3e2die,bashtonroar,7,Tue Jul 21 16:22:51 2015 UTC,"To say that Patron has almost 0 weakness is preposterous and a good example of the attitude this sub has formed towards the deck.  I will concede that of any class, Warrior benefits most from playing a combo deck.  The built in survivability makes it a much safer pick when compared to something like Leroy/Faceless Warlock, or Miracle Rogue.  Does that mean Warrior doesn't deserve a combo deck?  Maybe, but probably not."
hearthstone,3e2die,mymindpsychee,3,Tue Jul 21 16:48:17 2015 UTC,What are the weaknesses that allow for an opponent to exploit? Hope that PW doesn't draw into weapons or card draw which allows you to control the board and pressure them?
hearthstone,3e2die,bashtonroar,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe I misunderstood you the first time, I thought that you meant that Patron has no bad matchups.  It doesn't do well vs decks with large minions that pressure you.  Most Dragon lists do fairly well vs Patron, as large minions like twilight drake, blackwing corrupter, and blackwing technician are very resilient to the Patron styles of board control, as well as dragonkin sorcerer.  Handlock is also very powerful, and tech is great in the matchup.  Swamp Ooze and Harrison Jones deal with their weapons and prevent them from utilizing the deathrattle on Deaths Bite, while neither allow for free Patrons and trade for most of the Patron Utility Creatures (Unstable Ghoul, Acolyte of Pain, Loot hoarder, Armorsmith).  The board control doesn't come from the Patron deck as an archetype, but from the Warrior class in general.  Efficient removal basically defines the class with cards like Fiery War Axe, Death's Bite, Shield Slam, Brawl, and Execute.  It's the class that is supposed to be able to control the board well with targeted removal."
hearthstone,3e2die,mymindpsychee,0,Tue Jul 21 17:16:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know if PW has any truly bad matchups outside of Nozdormu decks. Handlock comes close thanks to Hellfire and giant taunts and is probably 35/65 at worst. Strong Dragon decks are probably closer to 45/55 which is still decent for PW. On the flipside, PW has some highly favorable matchups against most other decks.  A big problem with tech cards against PW is that you need to draw into them which is hard to do against PW's superior card draw. Handlock tap can keep up, but classes that lack the card draw only have their chances slightly improved.  I would also argue that Patron seals up the board control aspect. Weapons and Execute are very good, but Patron lets you clear the opponent's board while also developing your own board. That kind of board swing is insane and not possible with just Warrior's defensive prowess."
hearthstone,3e2die,bashtonroar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:52 2015 UTC,"Warsong + Patron only lets you clear the board if all of the opposing minions are <3 power.  True, Warsong + Patron + Inner Rage + at least 1 <3 power minion + Whirlwind can clear a whole board, but it costs a lot of cards, and often leaves you with several 3/1 Patrons and only one or two 3/3 or 3/2.  Any targeted removal + 2 or more damage AoE takes apart the entire Patron board, and they're left with very few cards in hand.  Battle Rage doesn't matter when they don't have the mana to cast it and then their board gets wiped.  Playing out all of your combo pieces, not killing them, and then getting your board wiped is very difficult to come back from as a Patron Player"
hearthstone,3e2die,adamleng,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:06 2015 UTC,"What people don't understand is that patron is accomplishing exactly what it should.   This might genuinely be the most idiotic argument I've seen on the topic. You can say this about literally anything. Undertaker was accomplishing exactly what it should. Buzzard was accomplishing exactly what it should. Being mad about Miracle? Look, Miracle is supposed to play solitaire and then OTK you on an empty board. With your logic nothing should ever be nerfed unless someone is exploiting a bug or something.    You can't say ""oh just nerf Frothing to not deal 15 in a turn"" because thats what Frothing gets played for.   That's the whole problem. Patron clearing your board and having 5+ patrons left can be countered, it can be dealt with. No one can deal with 30+ damage OTKs, and that's the most unfun part of the deck. If Frothing doesn't get played after the nerf (which I doubt, because a 3 mana 10+ attack creature is always going to be worth playing), then too bad."
hearthstone,3e2die,enlargeyourmalafat,3,Tue Jul 21 18:57:27 2015 UTC,I still think Warsong Commander could nerfed down to 2/1 so at least patrons after whirlwind effects don't get charge.

hearthstone,3e2die,Hoptimonium,4,Tue Jul 21 15:38:32 2015 UTC,The Frothing nerfs seem easy to me. Just limit the stacks to +6 or +8. A 10/4 for 3 is still very good and keeps the spirit of the card alive while toning down it's abuse scenarios.
hearthstone,3e2die,wubbbalubbadubdub,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:02:33 2015 UTC,"I think don't limit the stacks but change the card text to.  +4 damage every time the frothing berserker takes damage  it still allows the card to go  2/6/10/14 attack and get charge from the warsong commander, but you are no longer punished for filling up your own board against the warrior.  You could still break this limit by using commanding shout and wild pyromancer but it would be a much more difficult combo to pull off.  Sunshine was dominant because the opposing player had to have 2-3 powerful solid taunt minions and no other minions on their board. My suggested change would open up a few more options for counter play while still allowing for massive combo turns"

It would still be quite comboable just not to enormous late game OTK levels, although it would pair better with other warrior cards like cruel taskmaster in the early game which would make it an 8/3. but my comment got downvoted so I guess reddit hates this idea for some reason.  If they limited the stacks it would need to be put into card text which would just be adding extra complications, my way would keep the berserker theme from another card and not add any extra text."

The problem is not being able to interact with the charging Frothing in any way, so what about minions with constant effects to prevent the enrage shenanigans.  Something like an Aldor Peacekeeper for Paladin that has a constant effect of ""Minions cannot have more than 3 attack"", or some neutral minion that has ""Players can't draw more than 2 cards each turn"".  It's a way of dealing with the strength of the current cards without outright directly nerfing the deck.  edit: I think the game is in need of some strong anti-combo tech cards instead of nerfing all combo decks to the ground every time they make a resurgence.

hearthstone,3e2die,Nangz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:13 2015 UTC,"Little late to the party, expecting this to get buried.   While I agree with most of your post, I disagree completely on your analysis of Warsong Commander and Frothing Berserker.  Warsong Commander  More than 3 attack != no charge.   You're right, nerfing Warsong Commander in this way hurts the patron synergy itself even though it is aimed at the Frothing's synergy but lets remember some history.  When Patron was first used, one of the most common cards in the deck was Commanding Shout. It was a 2 mana cycle in many cases but it also served a purpose of letting patrons trade with minions who it would otherwise be unable to.  This is why nerfing the taskmaster and inner rage interaction isn't game breaking. It forces patron back into this card that they already have experience with and already functions the same way. In fact, by forcing patron to pickup another cycle, it may cause them to drop another card like Battle Rage another cycle based card.   Frothing:   You talked quite a bit about historical decks but do you remember what still mainstream historical deck used to run Frothing Berserker? Control Warrior! Control Warrior used to run Frothing as an out of control threat for only 3 mana. The card's strength is that its a 2/4 for 3 where it only takes one instance of its proc to be equal on value and anymore makes the card over-budgeted in terms of stats.   The problem with Frothing is that it was designed as a cheap out of control based creature, the type that IS SUPPOSED to soak removal like a knife juggler and like a whirling zap-o-matic. The early game equivalent of Ragnaros or Ysera. The type where you tell the opponent ""The longer this is on the board, the more you lose.""  This is why I don't feel Frothing needs nerfs and even if it did, I think the nerfs suggesting are too heavy handed. Nerfing the effectiveness by half is very punishing. A less punishing but still legitimate nerf would be something along the lines of   ""When other minions take damage, gain +1 attack"". This removes itself from the aoe equation and is a smaller percentage reduction to its strength than immediately removing half of available targets."

hearthstone,3e2die,Popsychblog,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:41 2015 UTC,"I think you're wrong about ET. Recreating my last comment on the issue:   ET fundamentally breaks certain aspects of the game, which is why it's played so often. It's played in all non-zoo warlocks, Druids, a number of mages, and all warriors.   But let's consider the case for nerfing it, just with respect to patron: Without ET, the best frothing combo from an empty board one can do is warsong, two frothings, 2 inner rages, a whirlwind, and, if you have the coin, a second whirldwind. That's a 10/11 mana combo involving 6/8 cards and it does 18/24 damage.  Now let's consider what patron can do with a single tick of emperor: warsong, two frothings, a patron, double inner rage, double whirlwind, double execute and, if you have the coin (along with the ability to hold an extra card) battle rage. That's a (non-reduced) 19/20 mana combo with 10+ cards doing 36 damage (if I've done the math right), killing two taunts and, potentially, drawing 7 or 8 cards. There are other scenarios with boards that can end up doing a lot more.  In fact, that first combo can be reduced to 6 mana down from 11 with a single tick of emperor. That's where the insane parts start to come in. The problem is not often that people get blown out by two charging frothings on turn 9; it's that it happens on turn 6 or 7.   To make the point clear by way of hyperbole, I predict that, if his effect remained the same, patron would still run emperor if he was a 0/1 minion for 6. That's why he should be hit.  If you've ever watched really good patron players, like Zalae, for instance, you can see how much of their game plan involves drawing the right cards and only then dropping emperor so they can put their 1-turn kill together. Indeed, the guide on frequent misplays with patron lists playing emperor at the wrong time to be a major one.   ET is not a card that HS needs to make it exciting, nor is ET the kind of card that has any realistic impact against aggro either (except inasmuch as in reduces the costs of FoN/Roar or Patron combos to kill the aggro deck a turn or two earlier). He's a six drop that has no immediate impact on the board state, meaning if you're playing ET against aggro, there's a good chance the game was already won or lost before he hit the board. His presence hasn't made control decks suddenly viable where they weren't before. The only new decks spawned by ET have been combo decks. Other decks just jam him in because he's good.   [EDIT]: Just watched the Archon Team League, Trump vs. Lifecoach. Take a good guess as to whether the ET lifecoach kept in his opening hand allowed that turn 6 lethal through two defended giants."
hearthstone,3e2die,pblankfield,0,Tue Jul 21 15:04:00 2015 UTC,"ET is fundamentally broken. People are happy because the meta shifted to combo from aggro but they will realize it sooner or later.  If Patron gets a (well deserved) nerf somewhere in its core class cards people will turn into the next crazy combo you can do with Thaurissan and with any new cheap damage spell Blizzard will add to the game it will get worse.  It's just unsustainable in the long run - the card is way too powerful - up to 10 mana discount per turn while being a 5/5 for 6 is crazy to begin with and warrants him a spot in all control decks. Allowing to multiply the finishing damage isn't only a ""Patron"" thing, it spreads to every possible combo deck existing now, and in the future."
hearthstone,3e2die,Popsychblog,2,Tue Jul 21 17:37:03 2015 UTC,"The shadow of the future is indeed something people don't seem to be talking about. ET will have an influence on every combo to come, as you said. As it stands now, I think he's the card giving patron those extra percentages of wins that make the deck the best. Without ET it could still be a good deck, but it would not be the best.   The same problem arises with mad scientist. New secrets are going to be constrained by scientist in terms of their quality where now, essentially, good secrets can't be made."
hearthstone,3e2die,AsoSako,0,Tue Jul 21 17:44:49 2015 UTC,"Since when is Grim Patron overpowered?  This is a ridiculous notion, the deck is simply not consistent enough to call it overpowered.  It is very situational that you can get a big berserker, and grim patron combo is at turn 8 and at that point the enemy doesn't always have those under 2 attack minions you need to trigger him.  It is also easy to notice if someone is running a grim patron deck and thus fairly easy to counter play with what they are trying to trigger in mind.  Just don't play too many low attack minions at around turn 8, don't flood the board and trade into his/her minions so as not to allow large berserkers.  This all seems complicated but bare this in mind you enemy needs to get some very specific cards to combo all of that perfectly, and the consistency is just not that damn high.  And please don't say what if they have Thaurissian.  Please yes if they get the perfect hand it is very strong (isn't that true for any deck...) but they have to get Thaurissian warsong grim patron and berserker and maybe a whirlwind or something of the sorts to kick off all that, and that is a crazy amount of cards to expect consistently enough."
hearthstone,3e2die,Kraisen,2,Tue Jul 21 17:37:16 2015 UTC,"The ridiculous amounts of effective/efficient card draw in the patron deck make it extremely reliable and consistent.  It is very easy to get the cards you need by turn 8. This is why you almost always see a patron turn on turn 8.  You say not to play small minions, but what about hero powers? The deck makes 2 of the classes hero powers a liability and ""being afraid of playing minions"" is exactly the thing that blizzard wants to avoid.  Besides that, a post a few days ago showed a patron warrior dealing something like 36 damage on a completely empty board. No minions needed whatsoever from his opponent.  This is the same problem as the old miracle rogue, only worse. There is just no good, reliable, way to counter patron warrior as it has great matchups against most decks and can crush aggro, control, and other combo decks with ease."

Part of the reason Patron is so good is that Frothing is so difficult to play around in a deck that can summon patrons off whirlwind.

Making it so that the Frothing only gains strength when enemy minions are damaged makes it so that the card can at least be played around.

hearthstone,3e2die,mymindpsychee,4,Tue Jul 21 15:48:52 2015 UTC,if you're controlling the board   That's what the Patrons and weapons prevent you from doing.

hearthstone,3e2die,mymindpsychee,2,Tue Jul 21 16:40:04 2015 UTC,People are teching Ooze and Harrison to try and deal with PW. The deck is still as popular and powerful as ever because your tech cards are still unlikely to hit the PW weapons because PW has superior card draw.  It was easy to control the board against Math Warrior. It is not easy to control the board against Patrons (unless you're Handlock).
hearthstone,3e2die,Drasha1,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:26 2015 UTC,What about just adding a tech card to the game to counter OTKs. Maybe a 1/4 with stealth that prevents more then 15 damage occurring in a single turn but dies when it does so.

hearthstone,3e36jj,PewterCityGymLdr,6,Tue Jul 21 16:53:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, but some of the math is pointless and/or misleading.  First he states that there is a 25% chance to steal the patron. That's true. However, it would have been even better if he stole the warsong commander, because then he could faceless the patron, clear the board and have even more patrons out, no whirlwind needed.  Secondly he states that it's a 6.25% chance of stealing the first whirlwind and 8.33% chance of stealing the second one, and that may be true. However, in both of those situations stealing a taskmaster would've been just as good (actually better).  Lastly, I don't see the point of including the chance of stealing the last warsong commander, because it served no purpose.  So while that exact sequence of events may have 0.01% chance of happening, the chance of a sequence of events yielding the same result is much higher."
hearthstone,3e36jj,Sworn,2,Tue Jul 21 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"Well... yea this is all true, his play wasn't optimal. I included the percents because without them the video was just kinda shitty.

The first is a 25% (or 50% considering /u/Sworn) and then he got two 1 damage cards from your deck, thats  maybe a 5% chance (not mathed out, but it isnt that low). The warsong is irrelevant since it does only 2 damage and nearly every other card in patron would be better here. Overall not that unlikely"

Totemic Recall:  2 mana. Recall any Totems that died in thr previous turn. Remove any overload (Lava Shock style).  Artwork needs to be Razorfen Downs Related, because I'm still on a Barrens nostalgia kick."
hearthstone,3dzdjf,genotaru,5,Mon Jul 20 22:20:00 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of them just adding several ways to remove overload. Lava Shock can be nice sometimes, but you don't get it consistently enough, nor do you actually get consistent value out of it either.   Both of those problems are mitigated though if they just add several other cards that also remove overload like yours. Combining them all together, you are able to build a nice overload deck and consistently remove the overload while often getting decent value out of the card you use to do it.  Your totem idea is great in situations where you've used overload to stabilize but still need board presence.  Other times you may have the board already (maybe from strong overload creatures) but still need reach. Great situation for Lava Shock.  My idea for a third option would be for when you aren't worried about the board on either side, but are really falling behind in card advantage:  Tidal Waves: 2  mana. Draw one card for each point of overload. Unlock your overloaded mana crystals.  Or maybe instead: 3  mana. Draw one card and an additional one for each point of overload. Unlock your overloaded mana crystals.   The second version is more of a refresh card, as it cannot be used for early game overload as easily. It's also at least a cycle card even when you don't have overload, which is probably for the best.  Or how about something that effectively acts like a coin in most situations and gives you nice tempo plays:   Spirit Walk: 3 mana. Gain one mana crystal this turn for each point of overload this turn only. Unlock your overloaded mana crystals.   Feral Spirit on 3 -> Spirit Walk + Sludge Belcher on 4. Or Lightning bolt + Fireguard on 5 -> Spirit Walk + Dr. Boom on 6. Let's Shaman play almost like a Ramp Druid."

hearthstone,3dzdjf,Peabnutbubber124,8,Tue Jul 21 13:35:09 2015 UTC,Would you agree that the searing totem (the 1/1) defeats the point of totems?
hearthstone,3dzdjf,furrot,52,Mon Jul 20 22:52:32 2015 UTC,It's certainly not as interesting or useful. Usually feels like the losing roll in most scenarios. Would have been more interesting if it was a 1 damage mini-rag.
hearthstone,3dzdjf,Omnivorax,19,Mon Jul 20 23:01:40 2015 UTC,"This is pure genius. Make a a 0 2 mini-rag. It would behave a lot more like the searing totems in WoW, too."
hearthstone,3dzdjf,NuclearMeatball,9,Tue Jul 21 00:52:03 2015 UTC,That really is a brilliant idea and it fits thematically. It could even be at the beginning of the turn if at the end of the turn is deemed too good.
hearthstone,3dzdjf,genotaru,3,Mon Jul 20 23:53:01 2015 UTC,"Never heard that idea before, sounds pretty cool. A 0/2 with 1 dmg random pings could be obnoxious as hell, but I think I would get a bit too frustrated at how often it would miss a good target. And it could be an even bigger nightmare against Patron warrior.  Lot's of things they can do with it though to make it stand out a bit more without adding even more RNG. 1/1 windfury (shaman's buff spell) would be kind of cool. Doesn't really challenge minions any differently, but has a bigger effect when unchallenged, especially with rockbiter/flametongue.   If anyone thinks that's too strong, gotta remember that it's only 25% chance to get it (unreliable), you can only have one most times, it's not mana efficient enough to run away with it early game, and it's still an easy ping target.   It is obviously just a stronger silver hand recruit on it's own merit, but with the above downsides (especially 25% RNG & max 1) and the lack of synergies that Paladin has, I think it's okay for it to be a bit stronger. That's kind of the point of shaman's RNG/overload mechanics anyways."

hearthstone,3dzdjf,Branith,12,Tue Jul 21 00:25:33 2015 UTC,Better be this expansion coming up or I'm seriously going to get pissed.  Overload is such a horrible design decision that only makes it worse as power creep sets in.
hearthstone,3dzdjf,Sipricy,15,Mon Jul 20 21:36:20 2015 UTC,"The mechanic isn't so bad. It's the lack of cards that combo with said mechanic that's dumb. Why not have a cheap minion, maybe something like 2 mana 1/2, that gains +1/+1 for each overload crystal you currently have? We just need more stuff to combo with overload. We need cards that make you want to have overload."
hearthstone,3dzdjf,vbl,8,Mon Jul 20 22:55:14 2015 UTC,"The mechanic is fundamentally bad as long as removal is cheap and easy. It's way too easy to nullify minions and any benefit Overload affords, nevermind the tempo loss that comes after."
hearthstone,3dzdjf,TehGrandWizard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:17:05 2015 UTC,"No, that logic is actually horrible. It is possible to make overload massively OP or UP, you could have a 2 mana shredder overload 1 or a 3 mana shredder overload 3.   The problem is that most overload is undertuned."
hearthstone,3dzdjf,flexr123,27,Tue Jul 21 11:51:29 2015 UTC,"No I think overload is a really good concept. It trades future tempo for current tempo, allowing players to play big threats a turn earlier. It's kinda similar to Druid Innervate, except that the trade off is a weaker future turn instead of card disadvantage. Most people complain about overload being a bad design but I think it is far from the truth. It's a niche class mechanics that seperates Shaman from any the rest of the classes which is cool. It also raises the skill cap as Shaman players need to make strategic planning for futute turns. (Not going overload on T5 to play fire elemental on T6). The prolem is that there are many overcosted overload cards around which got outvalued by the influx of new cards. Shaman needs more good overload cards such as Fireguard Destroyer to combat with the current meta power creep but the problem simply lies in bad cards, not the overload mechancs as a whole."
hearthstone,3dzdjf,Stormmblade,7,Mon Jul 20 23:33:02 2015 UTC,"I agree, in concept overload is fine in concept, except that in this aggressive meta, tempo is too important. Compare for example a druid innervating out an Ironbark Protector on turn 6, only to be BGH'd. The druid lost out on two cards and a turn, but can still follow up on the next one with a Sludge Belcher/Ancient of War or something. But if a Shaman plays an Earth Elemental on turn 5 and gets BGH'd, you only lose out on one card, but that turn is wasted and you just about can't do anything for the next turn either. You just fall too far behind.  This is one of the more extreme examples, but still kind of holds true for the others"
hearthstone,3dzdjf,MothProphet,3,Tue Jul 21 05:45:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think Overload would be a lot more manageable if you could choose to play the cards for Cost + Overload cost on turns where you had enough mana.  For example,   You could play lightning bolt on turn 1 for one mana, and be down one mana in the next turn.  Or  You could play lightning bolt on turn 2 for 2 mana, and not have to deal with the overload next turn.  That way, you just have a little more control over when you're overloading yourself, instead of overloading yourself every single turn. Maybe that's too strong, I'd love to hear your feedback on that."
hearthstone,3dzdjf,Shullbitsy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:40:31 2015 UTC,What if they made overload something like:  Lightning storm (choose overload):  0: Deal 1 damage to all enemy minions  1: Deal 2 damage to all enemy minions  2: Deal 3 damage to all enemy minions  So you basically choose the power level of the card and pay for it in overload
hearthstone,3dzdjf,Shockma_Ranyk,10,Tue Jul 21 07:49:25 2015 UTC,overload should be optional. You should be able to choose whether crackle costs you 3 now or 2 now and 1 next turn.
hearthstone,3dzdjf,Branith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:53:57 2015 UTC,"No overload should be something you welcome.  Is there one card you can name that you'd want to cast regardless?  No because Power Creep is too high for Overload to be of any use.  The only recourse is to remove it, or buff older cards in compensation.  Spirit Wolves to 3/4, Bolt to 4-5, Burst to 7-8, Crackle to 5-7, Earth Ele to 6/8 with 2 overload, Storm to 3-5.  Otherwise it is pointless and detrimental unless you have cards that synergize the turn after overloading."
hearthstone,3dzdjf,Anaklu,2,Tue Jul 21 11:42:02 2015 UTC,"it's not a horrible design decision, it just results in a lot of shaman cards being objectively worse than their non-overload alternatives because you can play them so much earlier."

It's a totally unique mechanic, synergizes well with healing totem, and works really well with health buffs (which is balanced by how scarce health buffs are in shaman.   However, what I would do with it is make it a 2-2 totem and change the effect to ""Whenever this minion takes damage from another minion.""

Second card seems good to me, strong because compared to Stormwind Axe you actually only pay 1 mana for 3 totems, but Shaman needs that. Last card again seems to strong. Some of your totems are gonna become 3/3 like Silverhand recruits, but others become 2/4 or even 2/5, since Shaman actually have Totems that don't come from Heropower they can play. Having 2/4 minions isn't inherently stronger than having 3/3s,but when they have a strong effect attached, for example the healing and they now can't easily be removed we have a problem.

Always decent, almost always underdog on the competitive scene. :)  Shaman is on a whole another level of trouble. The average joe climbing ladder is more often than not involved with aggro/combo/tempo (control being rare). Overload can make a lot of things fail on you, especially when cycling metas tend to replace control with tempo on the ""card game triad, if there's one"".  Shaman cards aren't terrible. Overload is terrible and, sometimes, can turn your well-tuned deck into something unreliable. The class itself isn't the problem, overload x ""the meta"" is a huge, huge problem.  In other words, people are crazy about board control nowadays (or they should be) and top decks can get you out of a bad spot more often than you would like - we don't complain because top decks are better than losing. Overload manages to cripple you on both situations, imo."

hearthstone,3e3dh1,geckygecko,-6,Tue Jul 21 18:51:33 2015 UTC,Not sure if you're being sarcastic but if not there's been a lot of big hints towards Argent Tournament in the way of scrolls/mounts/paladin and wrath gear etc...  I just think it's going to be new heroes.
hearthstone,3e3dh1,HyperactiveToast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:50 2015 UTC,"He's being very sarcastic.    I just think it's going to be new heroes.   No way in Hell. Perhaps new heroes might be announced IN TANDEM with something big, but Blizz would have a PR nightmare on their hands after initiating all this hype if it were only for a couple of $10 cosmetics."
hearthstone,3e3dh1,Inertia0811,2,Tue Jul 21 19:02:47 2015 UTC,"I would love it to be an actual Argent Tournament. Like a tournament-mode, that rewards you with new cards. Maybe even through playing vs. AI. But most importantly having PvP tournaments integrated into the game would be huge. (praise Wc3-tourneys)"
hearthstone,3e3dh1,Fairyonfire,2,Tue Jul 21 18:50:47 2015 UTC,It would be the most amazing thing if it was anything other than that. At this point the community is so heavily expecting it that it would be the greatest of trolls.
hearthstone,3e3dh1,aloehart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:54:11 2015 UTC,"exactly this, i also think when the new expansion is dropped they will nerf patron deck in someway."
hearthstone,3e3dh1,bkid1070,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:51:19 2015 UTC,"I imagine they will introduce new cards that the geniuses at blizzard THINK will counter patron. Just like they thought lil exorcist would be a viable counter to old UT. When that doesn't work they will insist that we just need to figure the counters out because the playerbase is so bad compared to them. Then, finally, a couple months later, they probably won't do anything."

Argent tournament was basically a filler raid pre the main raid of the expansion which was ICC. It really didnt have a huge significance in the story if I remember correctly Idk why they wouldnt put out ICC or some of the other bigger raids in BC and WOL.

hearthstone,3e0dwx,asdasdgfrw,4,Tue Jul 21 06:18:49 2015 UTC,For the flavour. And future possible synergies.  E.g. Lord Garithos - Give +2/+2 to all friendly Human minions.

You wouldn't play Beast Rogue for example because Rogues don't have Houndmaster, Call Pet, Scavenging Hyena, Tundra Rhino, or Killcom. By not making everything a tribal, more diversify is allowed because you're missing the inherent edge that tribal decks have. As it is, right now we have Mechs which are overall pretty balanced, Demons which seem pretty good, Dragons which suck, Murlocs which aren't the best, and Beasts which only Hunters and occasionally Druids use, which is fine."

If you had Eadric and majordomo on the board at the same time, Eadric would always get killed first. On the other hand, if you wait until after majordomo is dead to throw down Eadric, there's a good chance Ragnaros will be injured or dead before Eadric can help.  One other point I'd like to make is the synergy this card could have priest and warrior, because they have a much easier time staying at 30 health."
hearthstone,3e1p4o,TheCrypticFox,3,Tue Jul 21 07:54:27 2015 UTC,"It is not uncommon to see a full health Ragnaros in Majordomo Mage, but at the same time I'd say Eadric is not necessary for the deck either."
hearthstone,3e1p4o,vooffle,34,Tue Jul 21 08:02:15 2015 UTC,"I think a better card would be a 2 mana 3/4 ""Both heroes are immune"". It has great stats for it's cost, but you wouldn't be able to go face with it. It forces aggro to trade while giving control some early survivability."

hearthstone,3e1p4o,kpengin,0,Tue Jul 21 13:22:01 2015 UTC,"I mean the stats aren't that crazy. Innervate-Spidertank isn't gg, and that's only dropping a one card advantage. Relevant but barely.   Tbh the problem isn't aggro v control but any combo match up. Combo is just insane and easy to win with against any deck."
hearthstone,3e1p4o,kausb,13,Tue Jul 21 14:17:08 2015 UTC,2 mana for a 3/4 that has no downside for the person that played it is just too strong. It needs a downside.
hearthstone,3e1p4o,wabeka,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:59 2015 UTC,Yeah agreed
hearthstone,3e1p4o,kausb,4,Tue Jul 21 15:17:27 2015 UTC,The stats are that crazy though. Innervate + Spider Tank requires investing two cards. It will usually be a fair trade at 2-for-2. A 3/4 for 2 is unprecedented power creep and would probably be included in every single non-aggro deck.
hearthstone,3e1p4o,kpengin,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:33:12 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a large leap above what we have now. But to face the facts, it would still be barely relevant. You just throw implosion, frostbolt, Aldor, or a weapon at it. Pretty much any class can answer any body in the game, which is what I don't quite like as far as design goes. What makes minions relevant are stickiness and effects. Look what happens anytime voncleef hits the board. At above 6 it gets bgh'd and below it dies to just a searing spear (frost bolt, dark bomb, wrath, etc) + minion.   Hearthstone just supplies you with an abundance of answers for any minion that can hit the board at any point in the game, which is why I think freezemage is such a solid choice and why otks like control warrior finishers (alex+grommash+cruel task), combo druid (less so though), and patron warrior enjoy such a high consistency and winrate."
hearthstone,3e1p4o,kausb,2,Tue Jul 21 15:43:33 2015 UTC,"None of the ""answers"" you gave are actually good. At four health a frostbolt, darkbomb, fiery war axe etc. would not enough to kill it. Implosion and Truesilver Champion are 4 mana so neither could be used the turn you need it.  You also disregard cardadvantage completly, when you use a removal+minion you trade 2 for 1"
hearthstone,3e1p4o,Soleil06,9,Tue Jul 21 16:28:49 2015 UTC,that would be ridiculously op :P
hearthstone,3e1p4o,s3cco,25,Tue Jul 21 10:52:50 2015 UTC,"I feel like a card like that would make aggro utterly useless. You get a 2 mana 3/4 with an effect, that breaks an aggro deck's entire early game. It would usually trade 2 for 1, be alive for two turns and in many cases basically silence a leper gnome. hunter plays leper gnome turn 1, you coin out your 3/4 with basically no downside as a control-oriented deck. he plays scientist, you kill his leper gnome, take no damage, and then he can kill it with his scientist, while you already have another 2 drop in play, that can trigger the trap or trade with something else if it's explosive. Maybe you even run two of that card, and you instantly play the second one. I, as the agressive hunter, would concede by then.  It's also extremely strong against zoo, tempo mage and any other deck, that relies on early game creatures, because its statline is disgustingly strong."
hearthstone,3e1p4o,Kharaaz,9,Tue Jul 21 08:43:33 2015 UTC,"Then make it a legendary 3/3 for 2. Only one copy, and it can be dealt with by Abusive Sergeant, Owl, or Quickshot/Darkbomb easily. Just something that forces early trading."
hearthstone,3e1p4o,ATROX_Beats,11,Tue Jul 21 09:00:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think it being legendary and a one of is the problem. More so, the start line suggested was a problem, and 3/3 is still obviously broken for 2 mana. Not saying such an effect wouldn't be cool to have, but having it on a more expensive minion would be more fair, I think."
hearthstone,3e1p4o,zqmfbg,0,Tue Jul 21 09:42:26 2015 UTC,"I think the stats would be fine at 3/3 for 2 mana. It dies to all 2 mana removal, it dies to most 2 drops and it trades evenly with most 3 drops (something most two drops often can't do anymore because power creep has affected the 3 mana slot more than any other slot in the game). The only upside is that it doesn't die to a one drop. But the 3 attack often wouldn't even matter because early in the game, it would be trading with a 1 drop and a 2 drop, basically making it a Zombie Chow one turn later. And it can't attack the face, so the 3 attack means even less. It'd be fine."
hearthstone,3e1p4o,ATROX_Beats,10,Tue Jul 21 10:03:11 2015 UTC,"No; it should have ordinary stats, not OP stats. For 2 mana, you get a 2,3 or a 3,2.   Face hunter is not the only deck that finishes games before the opponent can find answers. There are a load of tempo decks (ex: zoo) that would love to have a 2 mana 3,3; tempo decks don't care about hitting your face, their strategy is to get an iron grip on the board and use it to win the game before you can do anything about it. They would absolutely love to get a 2 mana 3,3 which they can use to kill off any 2,3s for free. But not only that, it allows zoo to tap without losing health. Yeah, they can't attack face: so what; they can just fill their board then tap away till they also have a full hand.  TLDR: a 2 mana 3,3 without a downside is broken as fuck."
hearthstone,3e1p4o,Aaron_Lecon,3,Tue Jul 21 13:24:25 2015 UTC,"funny thing is as mage you could just not do anything until turn 7 and then flamestrike their board since they cant pressure you with this thing out. So ""no downside"" is a bit overboard, but i think it would even be enough as 2/3"
hearthstone,3e1p4o,velrak,2,Tue Jul 21 13:54:32 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting that flamestrike is not a board wipe against zoo, with their nerubean eggs and other assorted deathrattles.  Furthermore, zoo often runs void terror, which could eat the 3,3 as soon as he wanted to attack."
hearthstone,3e1p4o,Aaron_Lecon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:35 2015 UTC,I think that the card would be good as he made it. In my opinion forcing the minion trade and finishing the interaction with the heroes is as bad as just attacking face.
hearthstone,3e1p4o,Aridez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:25:06 2015 UTC,It'd be fine as a 2/3. It already has a strong positive effect. No need to include overbudgeted base stats on top of that.
hearthstone,3e1p4o,sohvan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:23:31 2015 UTC,"Its fine as a 2/2 for 2. Aggro isn't nearly dominant enough to where you need to add insanely broken counters, a normaly statted card is fine."
hearthstone,3e1p4o,BestMundoNA,2,Tue Jul 21 14:14:42 2015 UTC,A 2 mana 3-4 with a REALLY powerful ability? What the fuck?
hearthstone,3e1p4o,ShoogleHS,4,Tue Jul 21 15:28:51 2015 UTC,That would be way too powerful. Control decks already don't give a shit about their opponent taking damage (see: Zombie Chow) so this would simply wipe aggro off the face of the meta.
hearthstone,3e1p4o,Anaract,11,Tue Jul 21 14:57:38 2015 UTC,"It's a cool concept, but it's broken with Master of Disguise. Turn 6 Eadric/Master of Disguise, turn five healbot up to max health. If your opponent has no board clear he can't win, ever."
hearthstone,3e1p4o,Possomtail,10,Tue Jul 21 09:10:44 2015 UTC,"So ""broken"" is a 3 card combo over 2 turns, two of which are very bad on their own, that doesn't even guarantee a win? You and I have very different definitions of ""broken"" then."

Also, frequently the deck takes more than 1 turn to assemble a kill, whether that's from setting up a patron board on the turn before you go for the frothing kill, or thaurissan comes down to make you able to cast more than 1 whirl on your double frothing turn, or it could just be prepping a death's bite."

For example, Shaman is an instant lose against that combo if they don't have two lightning storms (or roll low with +1 spell power) and if they don't have any tech cards that deal random damage (Rag, Dr. Boom). The problem I guess is that you could get into a position where you literally can't do anything to win, and a lot of decks wouldn't have a tech option to get out of that spot. Mal'Ganis + Master of Disguise can't be included in the same deck list, but I feel like Blizzard would worry about adding a perma-stealth+perma-immune combo to the game."
hearthstone,3e1p4o,Boyhowdy107,4,Tue Jul 21 17:45:06 2015 UTC,"Too hard to pull off, if it was ""your hero is immune while you have less health than your opponent"" it would be worth it.  BTW: how did you get the alliance watermark on the card? Did hearthcards add it?"

hearthstone,3e1p4o,Rpgguyi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:28:10 2015 UTC,"yeah and what happens when you play this in a rogue deck and give him stealth, while being on 30 hp? may you even buff him um so he wont be removed by aoe and the game is already won"
hearthstone,3e1p4o,zedisfied_,2,Tue Jul 21 11:06:55 2015 UTC,"Rogue has no health buffs, so you're relying entirely on shattered sun cleric and defender of argus to do that. Meanwhile you're losing to equality, flamestrike, shadowflame, doomsayer, big blade flurries, spellpower hellfire in malylock, brawl... He's also a legendary so it's difficult to build a deck entirely around him - leeroy miracle rogue needed 5 mana gadgetzan to work. He also requires you to be at 30 life - good luck achieving that against aggro decks by turn 6+ while drawing into the combo, and if you CAN do that, then you don't need immunity because you've already won."
hearthstone,3e1p4o,ShoogleHS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:28 2015 UTC,"A 2 mana 1/4 won't see much play and its effect is basically worthless. The only decks against which you need it are very aggressive in nature and it's rather unlikely that you will be at max hp once you play this guy (unless you coin him out on t1). As soon as you lost a single point of hp, he will be essentially useless."
hearthstone,3e1p4o,Eyecelance,2,Tue Jul 21 11:11:05 2015 UTC,"With that interaction there might be some new decks that might take profit out of it. Maybe a priest can put it behind taunts and that would create a hard time for the enemy, or a spare part deck that can give it stealth for one turn, making it hard to remove while you can stealth him."
hearthstone,3e1p4o,Aridez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:28:54 2015 UTC,"If you're a priest at 30 life with taunts up, you don't need this card to give you immunity. Unless you really want to hard counter an OTK mage deck... for a single turn until the mage simply kills your 1-4."

hearthstone,3e1p4o,tapk69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:19:20 2015 UTC,Actually this card would be too overpowered with rogue you just plop this guy out and stealth him with master of disguise. Of course you need to be full hp which is hard but still it would be super strong.

hearthstone,3e0rsd,The_Vikachu,82,Tue Jul 21 03:25:17 2015 UTC,That's because you still played minions instead of swording each turn.
hearthstone,3e0rsd,All_My_Loving,17,Tue Jul 21 02:56:56 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness, is there a good limit as to how many truesilvers you should take into the arena with you? And whats the best strategy with them, for control or face?"
hearthstone,3e0rsd,K_is_for_Karma,52,Tue Jul 21 03:35:20 2015 UTC,"You want board control, period. Use them to kill stuff and use your minions to go face. If you have like 5, you can afford to go face on turns where there's nothing to hit if you are thinking you'll draw another immediately"
hearthstone,3e0rsd,_Apostate_,12,Tue Jul 21 03:40:09 2015 UTC,"1st and 2nd are autopick (except there is Consecration). 3rd loses some value, I take premium cards like Shredder, Shielded Minivot or even a Yeti over TSC now. 4th still good, but I take Creeper or Tiger now. 5th only if the other choices are trash. So I guess it really drops from 4th to 5th for me.   Thats how I do it."
hearthstone,3e0rsd,zeon0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:39 2015 UTC,Can you ever pick shredder or minibot over truesilver? Those two are commons but truesilver is basic. Genuine question.
hearthstone,3e0rsd,insaneblane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:42 2015 UTC,Basics are considered common for arena picking.
hearthstone,3e0rsd,AladoraB,0,Tue Jul 21 19:07:36 2015 UTC,"I would take truesilver over consecration if I have a very aggro-ish deck though. Other than that, you are absolutely right."
hearthstone,3e0rsd,popje,5,Tue Jul 21 17:13:02 2015 UTC,"The main thing you need to realise is that mulligan strategy changes drastically. If you have 2 Truesilvers you'll generally want to keep any you get, as it's basically the strongest turn 4 move a Paladin can do. In the case of 4+, however, you need to mulligan them away. By the time turn 4 hits you'll most likely have drawn one, if you don't just directly mulligan into a new one to begin with.  I think people stating that 2 or 3 is the limit just don't adapt mulligan strategy at higher numbers. Personally, I have no qualms picking as many as 5 (I've been in this situation before), and depending on the offers I'll happily accept a 6th too.  The same goes for other similarly high ranked cards. Having a lot of copies of a card with very high value isn't a problem as long as it doesn't restrict your options by filling your hand with ONLY that card."
hearthstone,3e0rsd,Axros,6,Tue Jul 21 13:52:26 2015 UTC,"Depending on curve, I don't like to take more than 4 usually. Average 7~ wins  Also go for control, always. and save charges unless you either are about to die, or have another true silver and no other plays in hand."
hearthstone,3e0rsd,jimbo_extreme,3,Tue Jul 21 03:46:08 2015 UTC,"All-in-all, you want good cards. If Truesilver is next to 2 shitty cards, then pick truesilver.   I personally think that 3 swords should be the limit, but if you have no choice and the other cards suck, then you can go over that limit."
hearthstone,3e0rsd,Ecorin,2,Tue Jul 21 08:02:37 2015 UTC,Maybe ask this in /r/arenaHS/. Might be an interesting discussion
hearthstone,3e0rsd,Gin-Chan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:55:13 2015 UTC,Not really. There was a guy sometime ago who went 12-0 with like 9 truesilvers.

hearthstone,3e0rsd,Metafrank,2,Tue Jul 21 08:26:32 2015 UTC,In January 2015. But it was 7 and not 9.
hearthstone,3e0rsd,Zakdawg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:58:53 2015 UTC,"I had 8 Truesilvers in a run back when the max arena wins was 9 (so way before chugga and the influx of 5 health minions.).  Went 9-0, none of the game were even close.  Still the only max wins run I've had, granted I never play arena.  I can see it being harder now, but I would be interested in knowing how OP lost the other two games since this one was clearly because of the chugga's."
hearthstone,3e0rsd,ShotIntoOrbit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"They're good removal for sure, but often used on 4 and 5 drops, so you can take 3-5 damage a swing even after the heal, and if you're up against an aggro deck, weapon swings are a good way to lose.  I would take the first 2 for sure, and I'd take the 3rd if I didn't have another strong weapon or a great alternative choice.  If it was early (like pick 12) I might take 4, but then I'm going hard around those choices, trying to get strong late and early game, since the mid is covered."
hearthstone,3e0rsd,pastabolicles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:37 2015 UTC,"Basically, first two are autopick, third is ""almost"" autopick, fourth is like worth a yeti. After that they can flood your hand pretty much. If you have 4+ truesilvers, always mulligan it away. The odds of redrawing one by turn 4 are very high. And if you have 4+ just hit everything with your face. Even small minions. Keep developing your board while slapping his board clean each turn.  Ive had four truesilvers five times now, each one of them went 8+ wins."
hearthstone,3e0rsd,HammerbroHS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:44 2015 UTC,I took 5 of them once.  Got 7 or 8 wins which is as well as I ever do.  I feel like more then that and they might start being a liability.  Even with 5 I occasionally had to play kinda weird to get value out of them.
hearthstone,3e0rsd,McBeers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:09 2015 UTC,4 is probably the limit and control is the goal.
hearthstone,3e0rsd,aloehart,0,Tue Jul 21 16:59:57 2015 UTC,3 is a good number. Don't take more than 4.
hearthstone,3e0rsd,zondabaka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:39:08 2015 UTC,I never draft more than 4 unless the other choices are complete trash.    With 4 you're free to Sword face and gain that 2 health too since you'll likely draw more quickly.

Also weapons are a bit different as you can get 7-mana stuff like gorehowl and doomhammer with this. Secrets are slightly overcosted cards for 3 or less mana. Not a particularly fair comparison.
hearthstone,3e1a0n,KingSorin,5,Tue Jul 21 09:24:08 2015 UTC,"You have to have a weapon and it is removed from the deck to use, much like mad scientist works.  Would increasing the creature to a 4/4 for 4 be any better to balance it?"
hearthstone,3e1a0n,Unknown_Phate,2,Tue Jul 21 09:46:21 2015 UTC,"No, it needs trash stats because it basicly thins your deck by one card and also puts a secret worth 2-3 mana in play. Why should it have good combat effectiveness too."
hearthstone,3e1a0n,Sidesody,3,Tue Jul 21 10:25:42 2015 UTC,Slightly overcosted? How is 2 mana 2 damage AoE that hit all enemies overcosted? How is 2 mana return a minion and it will cost 2 more to replay overcosted? How is 3 mana survive leathal damage overcosted? How is 3 mana gain 8 armor overcosted? How is 3 mana counter ANY spell and stop potential leathal overcosted?  If anything I would say that the secret are generally undercosted for their effects.
hearthstone,3e1a0n,Mazzix,5,Tue Jul 21 12:33:06 2015 UTC,Because they're fairly easy to play around.
hearthstone,3e1a0n,drswnemo,2,Tue Jul 21 12:54:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly, thats what makes them on par with the manacost not overcosted."
hearthstone,3e1a0n,Mazzix,2,Tue Jul 21 13:03:45 2015 UTC,The only secrets that were even run pre-Naxx was explosive trap and the occasional freezing trap. Most secrets are overcosted and nearly unplayable without mad scientist.
hearthstone,3e1a0n,drunken_monologues,3,Tue Jul 21 14:39:48 2015 UTC,They'r balanced because you don't control them when they're activated. If they were like trap cards in Yugioh then they'd be crazy but instead your opponent needs to play into them. Sometimes they wreck your deck but sometimes you laugh through them. That's just how card games work.

hearthstone,3e1a0n,notayeti,9,Tue Jul 21 09:14:58 2015 UTC,"Scientist is needed to make secrets viable though.  I play midrange hunter at high legend, I know the deck inside out and what each card does, how strong it is - scientist is definitely the strongest card in the deck for its mana cost, with highmane also being ridiculous, and scientist does come out on turn 2.  Its just Blizzard have made 2 copies of an overpowered card in order to accompany an archtype that would otherwise be unused. In the mid hunter deck, the traps are often the weakest in the deck. I run snake trap, which is definitely the weakest card in the deck, just cause I feel I need the 3rd trap to make best use of the scientist (Ensure it gets value later into the game, as well as being able to play multiple scientists on the board and have them both proc). i.e. The scientist is strong enough to carry the 'weaker' cards.  I think its necessary for hunter/mage to have scientist, and it needs to be a similar powerlevel to what it is for those classes to remain viable.  If scientist was removed, I think there'd be a face hunter deck, and no other hunter."

hearthstone,3e1a0n,TheDool,12,Tue Jul 21 08:54:14 2015 UTC,Boom bots should do 0-3 damage. That way sometimes they're dud 1/1s and it matches the card text that they MAY explode.

It isnt fun to spend all your mana on one minion, while your opponent uses 3 mana to remove it, getting a free body and develope the board further/playing spells with the rest of his mana. Cairne used to be one of the best cards in the game for the same reason. He couldnt be removed with one card."

hearthstone,3e1a0n,Mistrelvous,2,Tue Jul 21 10:05:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely Dr Boom for me, due to what he's done to the meta.  Dr Boom is ridiculous value for his cost.  I don't mind his conceptual design—a big body with two small bodies that have a positive deathrattle—but even without the deathrattle Dr Boom is still way overbudgeted for its cost.  Every midrange or later non-combo deck wants to run him and you can't afford to not counter him, either with your own Boom or the closest any card comes to countering him:  BGH.  The problem is that this leads to nearly every deck having BGH.  It's no longer really a tech choice because it has largely lost the risk of including—you aren't just aiming for control warriors and handlocks, you're aiming for most of the decks in the meta.  BGH is a necessary part of the game, since it allows the meta to adjust to an overly popular control deck, but Dr Boom has changed the game to where ""running a 7+ attack creature"" is no longer a sign of a control deck.  Remove Dr Boom and suddenly there's a lot more design space available for big minions.  I went back and rewatched pro prediction videos for GvG and not once was ""dies to BGH"" used as a reason why a card was bad, yet these days it seems that most people would find a 7+ attack minion with no immediate effect unplayable due to BGH.  I would love to see the BGH meta return to the pre-GvG days."

Compare savage roar to Bloodlust, you need at least 3 minions before bloodlust adds more damage, and in emergency situations SR is always 2 damage on the hero."
hearthstone,3e1a0n,TBNecksnapper,8,Tue Jul 21 09:07:00 2015 UTC,"I agree. Either savage roar should cost 1 more, or not grant attack to the Druid. I vote cost one more. FoN is fine."

hearthstone,3e1a0n,veraxAlea,13,Tue Jul 21 10:19:54 2015 UTC,"Emperor Thaurissan. It's cool what kinds of clutch turns he enables particularly in control decks, and the combos can be fun when you're playing the combo deck. The problem is, he creates game states that you simply can't play around.  I don't know, I might just be salty since I'm a fan of playing really slow decks, but things like seeing emperor from a Malylock before I can kill them usually means I'm dead unless a wild healbot appears."
hearthstone,3e1a0n,Aaron_Lecon,4,Tue Jul 21 05:00:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely ET. I feel like not a lot of thought was put into creating that card. Or maybe Blizzard just didn't care and chose to release a blatantly OP card.   It's not just that he creates OTK's, he enables stupid combos that should never have been possible before. On one hand, you can argue that he creates deck diversity. On the other, it can be argued that his effect is so strong that it made a niche completely dominate the game.    Another thing. Notice how Rogue used to be THE combo class? Releasing ET was essentially giving Rogue the middle finger and giviing her toys to every other class."
hearthstone,3e1a0n,threehoepunch,3,Tue Jul 21 09:54:55 2015 UTC,"I think that he should be nerfed to a 4,4. His ability is on par with gadgetsan (arguably stronger since it doesn't require any set up), which is also a 6 mana 4,4.  Would it still be run? Yes. It is an essential, irreplaceable part of Patron Warrior, the top deck of the meta. It is also really strong in any other combo deck like Malylock or Freeze Mage, and not because of the stats, because its ability is so strong that getting just one turn of it enables an OTK. Really the only places where it would stop getting played would be control decks, for whom a mana discount is not that important for their overall strategy.  Why would this be good for the metagame? This makes card like Cairne, Argent Commander and bomb lobber better; cards which are strong but aren't run because they have no targets to kill.  PS: sorry priests."

hearthstone,3e2610,Snics,-23,Tue Jul 21 11:47:59 2015 UTC,that would just break the game cause you can't choose things at the end of your turn (rag) or during the opponents turn (sylvanas).  edit:  why the downvotes? Its true. effects like that wouldn't work in the game.

hearthstone,3e2610,Ninivagg,8,Tue Jul 21 14:12:46 2015 UTC,Hey this post is a joke.
hearthstone,3e2610,hotham,3,Tue Jul 21 16:18:50 2015 UTC,"Well, yes. The engine isn't there, but it's a triggered effect similar to MtG. A trigger essentially freezes the game until a target is chosen. Again, in MtG, when a trigger happens, it goes on the stack and passes priority to the other player who may decide if he would like to act in response or allow the trigger to resolve.  So in theory, if I kill sylvanas, her ""exit the battlefield/enter the graveyard"" ability triggers, allowing my opponent to choose the target. Now what would be really cool in this scenario is that when he chooses the target, I can respond by triggering rag and targeting his target. Since rag's trigger goes on top of the stack, it resolves first. Sylvanas' trigger has no legal target any more (it died to rag) and her trigger resolves with no legal target (ie. She steals nothing).   The ability to stack player spells and triggers on either players' turn is what makes the strategy of MtG leagues beyond what Hearthstone offers. It's not card volume, it's areas of interaction.   Anyway, my two cents."

hearthstone,3dyrbw,ElementalThreat,8,Mon Jul 20 19:01:49 2015 UTC,"To be honest I don't really get why legendary weapons are restricted from transmogrification.  Sure, I kind of understand that they want to keep the legendary feeling of legendaries considering if they were transmogable every single rogue would run around with Warglaives as a transmog, but honestly the legendary feeling is already gone considering how easily obtainable they are and everyone already have several legendaries. I believe my brother have both Warglaives on six characters.   Where's the legendary feeling in that?"
hearthstone,3dyrbw,IAmInside,13,Mon Jul 20 19:33:25 2015 UTC,I was ok with legendary weapons being restricted but I have no clue why they restricted the goofy looking items as if to 'preserve the nature of the game' like gaudy green/purple/gold mixtures of armor somehow was a direction of art that needed protecting

After all, in WoW you can obtain Sulfuras twice, as the Hand of Ragnaros from the Molten Core, and the Extinguished Hand from the Firelands. How this would relate to the Argent Tournament is a bit questionable though.  Also to note, the character in the image is wearing the Ulduar Paladin set. Ulduar was the raid preceding the Argent Tournament."
hearthstone,3dyrbw,Exnon_,2,Mon Jul 20 17:17:20 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, just remember that we already had Sulfuras as a weapon in the Nef v Rag brawl, and it'd be weird to see it again so soon but as a different card.

hearthstone,3dyrbw,-Zaros-,3,Mon Jul 20 17:18:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is just the art of someone returning from Molten Core after conquering Rag?

hearthstone,3dyrbw,Rainieri,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:46:35 2015 UTC,It would have to be the OG sulfuras hand of ragnaros (The craft able legendary) and not the Extinguished hand of ragnaros because the tier the paladin is wearing was not relevant at all when extinguished hand of ragnaros came out in the firelands patch in cataclysm because the extinguished hand came out wayyy after this tier. Also if it is argent tournament than it would be a legendary sulfuras because argent tournament came out in wrath. But don't know why he'd be using a level 60 weapon but either that or I'm completely wrong and it's all transmog lol.
hearthstone,3dyrbw,Funkin_donuts,2,Mon Jul 20 17:57:15 2015 UTC,But than again transmog didn't come out until cataclysm and the argen tournament came out in wrath...

hearthstone,3dyrbw,de_feuve,2,Mon Jul 20 19:05:51 2015 UTC,"comparing to GvG the Argent Tournament is perfect imo for an expansion. again there's a kind of conflict between two parties, some FU-UN together and don't miss the fact Argent Tournament provides a variety of cards to implement with whole different topics related too. Maybe we even get to see Anub'arak as a card, some death knight stuff and (tho i don't think they'll use it this early) don't forget even the Lich King made an appearance in TotC...  dont expect to see another adventure like naxx and brm within 2-3 months"
hearthstone,3dyrbw,xGrimReaperzZ,8,Mon Jul 20 20:31:35 2015 UTC,"My guess: a champion is a card that replaces your hero with it's own health/armor/power-- except when the champ's health is zero, your original hero jumps back into the fray.  The champs will have minion level hit points (like 4, 5, 6), so it's not good for much more than surviving a couple face hits.  The Majordomo's Rag will be rebalanced to be a champ."

The Argent tournament was very much a lead-up to the big endgame of Icecrown. This time around, there has been no mention of anything related to the Argent Dawn/crusade, and it's all focused on the tournament/big battle theme. This is the first teaser image to definately feature something obviously Argent tournament related. The rest have been pretty miscellaneous.  Second, the pic isn't lore-related. That's a stylized portrait of a  player character judging by the gear.  Thirdly, there wasn't much to the lore of the Argent tournament itself, which is why people have been wondering why it would be the focus of a (presumably) large card set.

hearthstone,3dyrbw,danhakimi,3,Mon Jul 20 18:40:44 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that maybe like you could get a Dwarf champion that you would use to somehow change/enhance your traditional class in hearthstone.  So like you could have a Dwarf Hunter or a Dwarf Warlock.  Don't know how this would work, but maybe the dwarf classes reduces your health at the start of the match, but buffs some other stats like the hero power.  This would allow more hero combinations without increasing the number of default hero classes beyond the current 9.  Probably a bad and confusing idea, but an idea none the less."

hearthstone,3dyiwh,arly803,7,Mon Jul 20 19:37:59 2015 UTC,Murky's deathrattle summons the egg. Egg's ability kills it at the start of your turn and it has Deathrattle: Summon Murky.
hearthstone,3dyiwh,RussellLawliet,6,Mon Jul 20 19:40:37 2015 UTC,Thats a lot of wording to put into hearthstone terms
hearthstone,3dyiwh,flPieman,13,Mon Jul 20 19:50:56 2015 UTC,"Hardly.   ""Deathrattle: Summon a Murky Egg.""   ""Deathrattle: Summon Murky. Destroy this card at the start of your turn."""
hearthstone,3dyiwh,RussellLawliet,15,Mon Jul 20 20:09:56 2015 UTC,"I think the more correct term is ""At the start of your turn, destroy this minion and summon Murky."" a la Homing Chicken and Mimiron's Head. In your scenario, we would end up with a never-dying Murky (unless silenced), which is probably something Blizzard doesn't want.  Edit: You could also make it ""At the end of your opponent's turn"" to let it attack afterwards."
hearthstone,3dyiwh,Snipufin,4,Mon Jul 20 21:41:53 2015 UTC,But my opponent always has never dying sneeds :(
hearthstone,3dyiwh,mainman879,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:47:09 2015 UTC,"Because the wording used above was wrong.   Only Murky should have the Deathrattle that summons the Egg. Egg should have ""At the start of your turn, summon Murky."" Like the Doomsayer effect. So opponent would have to kill both Murky and the Egg. It wouldn't be a full circle of Egg -> Murky -> Egg -> Murky (unless Silenced) like the previous comment stated.   And if we would want to be precise and follow HotS mechanics. There, you needed to kill the Egg FIRST so the Murky wouldn't ress. So it should look like this.  Murky. Battlecry: Summon a 0/5 Murky Egg. Murky Egg. At the end of each turn, if the Murky died this turn, summon him.  This means that if you try to kill Murky without killing the Egg, it just gets resurrected soon - just like it was in HotS. You first need to either Silence or kill the Egg to then kill the Murky. The wording should probably be improved to be more Blizzard-like, but you get what I mean."

hearthstone,3dy61t,Kitsman,148,Tue Jul 21 14:42:55 2015 UTC,At this point let's wait for the announcement to hopefully imply some nerfs or the introduction of some counter cards. Even when Thaurissan is involved 35 dmg from an empty board on turn 9 is kinda too much to be considered healthy. The only time I survived this combo was when I was playing control warrior and had 51 total hp. The patron warrior did exactly 50 dmg to me after an hour of awkward animations probably because he slightly fucked up missing 1 dmg somewhere. This deck can be completely ridiculous at times...
hearthstone,3dy61t,Jahkral,32,Mon Jul 20 16:08:02 2015 UTC,"Technically less damage than the old enrage worgen build.  That being said, patron is way, way, WAY more flexible than the worgen build.  Worgen was hilarious when it worked because most of the time you'd be missing a core combo piece and lose pitifully.  Patron... not so much."
hearthstone,3dy61t,VoidInsanity,5,Mon Jul 20 17:17:26 2015 UTC,The main difference is the game has had a massive influx of whirlwind effects for warrior since then which patron / frothing benefit from massively and double up as board clears.
hearthstone,3dy61t,Ruaven,19,Mon Jul 20 18:41:51 2015 UTC,"I hate the Patron shit toó but saying that one Thaurissan proc isn't enough to justify that kind of damage is wrong IMO.   Let's remember the OTK decks from the past. Miracle Rogue and the not so pupular Warlock. Just think about those Leeroy, cold bloods, Arcane Golem, Faceless and Power Overwhelming with a discount from Thaurissan. Those combos will still be OP and then the discount enables Eviscerates and direct damage spells and the like.   They need to nerf that shit but Thaurissan is not the problem."
hearthstone,3dy61t,Nessuno_Im,34,Mon Jul 20 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"You are missing some considerations.  First, that the Patron warrior is doing more than just stalling the way the other combo decks normally do. He can control board with removal, minions, and weapons.  Second, his combo IS removal and board clear, which gives him so much more flexibility than any deck of this kind.  In fact, if he removes your board with patrons and you can't remove his board the very next turn, you lose.  Oh, and his board is one of the hardest to remove.  Third, he effectively has more than one combo.  He has 2 combos x2."
hearthstone,3dy61t,AngryBeaverEU,5,Mon Jul 20 18:41:52 2015 UTC,"Well, i said it multiple times:  Main problem with Patron Warrior is that it has to many strong win conditions. It can win by generating overwhelming boards (especially vs. Druid with a turn 5 patron-inner rage-deathbite (or coin whirlwind)), it can win by dealing huge amounts of (charge/weapon) damage in multiple instances, it can win by 60+ damage bursts even against Taunts, it can win by getting out of reach of opponents (the classical double armorsmith gain 20+ health against Face Hunter).  It has lots of stall, tons of draw. It is probably the most overpowered deck hearthstone ever had. And even the decks that counter patron warrior lose a considerable amount of games against it, because if Patron Warrior gets a good Thaurissan at turn 5/6 it pretty much doesn't matter what cards the opponent has...  Patron Warrior combines everything Blizzard ever nerfed. Huge draw-combos like Unleash the Buzzard and strategies that profit from the opponent building a board (=battle rage & frothing). Huge one-turn-bursts from an empty board (Molten Giant Warrior, Miracle Rogue) and non-interactive gameplay (Miracle again).  So yes, Blizzard will nerf it. And they will nerf it by nerfing Warsong, because that is - again - the card that makes the deck broken. Changing it to an aura that gives minions with 7 or less attack charge would solve all problems. No charging giants, nor charging 30-attack-frothings, but still charging patrons (even inner raged) and even charging Dr. Booms... the deck would still be viable, but it would have less win conditions."
hearthstone,3dy61t,empathogen75,14,Tue Jul 21 10:43:40 2015 UTC,"Everytime someone gets all worked up about a combo deck, I always point out that discard effects would wreck these.  Imagine something like:  4 mana 2/4, deathrattle: opponent discards a card at random.  Would barely hurt an aggro or control deck  (you can trade 2 for 1 with a 4 mana 2/4 in so many ways), but it would punish the hell out of combo decks (woops, lost your force of nature, woops, lost your garrosh, woops, lost your warsong commander)."
hearthstone,3dy61t,touchet29,12,Mon Jul 20 21:34:08 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that Blizzard is against this kind of mechanic as they say it is just too unfun. But then again, when has that ever been an issue?"
hearthstone,3dy61t,Mitosis,10,Mon Jul 20 22:56:40 2015 UTC,"They made comments to that effect in beta way back. Illidan used to be both players discard their hands and draw 3 cards. Mind Vision used to steal a card from your opponent's hand for 6 mana, rather than copy.  It's always possible they'll change their stance on the subject, but yeah, the lack of ways to interfere with your opponents puts combo decks on a big pedestal in Hearthstone."
hearthstone,3dy61t,TheWoIfSage,5,Tue Jul 21 00:09:05 2015 UTC,"Does anyone think they would consider it differently if cards were discarded from the top of their deck?  Might work, as you technically didn't have the option to begin with and it's not taking it from your hand, but then again, I kind of feel the opposite way. Discarding randomly never bothered me, but mill decks piss me off (even when I win)."
hearthstone,3dy61t,dollenrm,5,Tue Jul 21 03:24:19 2015 UTC,More fun than getting 360 windmill slammed from full health to death off an empty board on turn nine ... Like its ridiculous he had overkill on top of it!
hearthstone,3dy61t,Spacemancleo,37,Tue Jul 21 03:29:30 2015 UTC,"It absolutely baffles me that people can put out 2 30 damage charge frothings in one turn and I still see people bitching about animation times, yeah lets make that deck stronger.  EDIT: Since everyone seems to think i'm pro animation time taking up most of your turn, let me explain, it's not that I think animations shouldn't be fixed, but before we go making patron a stronger deck than it already is, lets fix the deck. All i'm saying is that there are bigger fish to fry."
hearthstone,3dy61t,EpicBroccoli,192,Mon Jul 20 17:10:35 2015 UTC,"It's really stupid to balance around animation times though, if the deck is OP, it's OP, nerf the cards, don't just let animations be the ""limiting factor"" since that needlessly just prevents people from playing the deck on mobile or with crappy computers."
hearthstone,3dy61t,N0_B1g_De4l,19,Mon Jul 20 17:31:21 2015 UTC,"And having the animations as ""balancing factor"" encourages you not to think and instead just go for it, because if you spend the time to actually figure out what the right play is, you won't have the time to make that play. The deck punishes you for thinking about the game."
hearthstone,3dy61t,Pascal3000,14,Mon Jul 20 20:04:52 2015 UTC,"So much this. I played 400-500 games of Patron and made it to top 20 legend with the deck, i'm by no means new to the deck or unexperienced, but i frequently find myself going ""well, that seems pretty lethal-ish, let's just go before time becomes an issue"", because i am literally unable to take the extra 5-10 seconds of counting out if it's lethal.   http://i.gyazo.com/62e49b7d52959e49b410c6c87fa329b3.jpg    Is this lethal or not? I sure as hell couldn't tell you when i started comboing my turn and i sure as hell wouldn't have had the time to get all attacks off were i to count it and then try comboing through Armorsmith, Frothing and Ooze animations.    Spoiler: 1 dmg off if you sequence it perfectly, i was 2 dmg off in the game. Lost to brawl --> Shield Block --> Alexstraza next turn in case that makes you happy)"
hearthstone,3dy61t,Brawl97,2,Mon Jul 20 21:12:45 2015 UTC,"Thids deck is hard, where do you get 1 dmg off here? I keep counting but armor smith procs ruin everything"
hearthstone,3dy61t,Pascal3000,7,Mon Jul 20 21:52:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure anymore, i wrote down like 4 or 5 different variations. Something like Inner Raged Patron into Sludge, Patron into Ooze, Patrons into Armorsmiths, trade off patron into grom, WW. I think this is slightly off the optimal solution, but should get you 2-4 life in range of the kill.  EDIT: You WW before trading into Grom then your Frothings + War Axe do 45 damage and opponent is at 46 life after gaining 7 armor (2x Belcher for 2 each = 4, Armorsmith for 2, Armorsmith for 1 = 7)  I did it the other way around in the match and ended up 2 short.    EDIT2: If you whirlwind before killing the second Armorsmith, then trade into Grom, then into the Armorsmith you end up with 3 extra damage by giving him three extra armor, which also puts you 1 dmg off lethal."
hearthstone,3dy61t,Brawl97,2,Mon Jul 20 22:12:07 2015 UTC,ty. I see now why u are legend and i am rank 4 scrub  This deck man
hearthstone,3dy61t,Sipricy,11,Mon Jul 20 22:41:06 2015 UTC,"If you input all of your actions and end your turn as Patron Warrior, I shouldn't lose my turn just because your animations are taking up time on my turn.  Likewise, regardless of the deck, you should NOT be hurt by animations that you did not program into the game. Imagine if a Hero Power took 60 seconds to animate. Sounds pretty stupid, right? Likewise, it's not my fault that my cards animate for stupid amounts of time. I shouldn't be punished for using those cards."
hearthstone,3dy61t,brandus,143,Mon Jul 20 20:07:04 2015 UTC,Literally every argument against unleash the hounds and miracle rogue applies to patron/frothing charge combo. That shit is not fun to play against.

hearthstone,3dy61t,geeky_username,16,Mon Jul 20 17:03:56 2015 UTC,"Not fixing warsong sooner was the problem.  It was broken for so long, and so many low attack cards were introduced.

hearthstone,3dy61t,proto_biont,9,Mon Jul 20 19:52:02 2015 UTC,"14 does not equal 35.  Even FoN double savage is only 22.  I suppose in the extremely unlikely event that you had all 4 combo pieces in your hand, and both innervates you could do 40 from an empty board."

Meaning that you can summon a 2 attack minions, it gains charge, then you can buff it to 4+ attack and it will still have charge.  His change makes it so that the minion has charge when its attack 3 or less. Meaning if you were to buff it afterward, it would lose charge."
hearthstone,3dy61t,Diabols,16,Mon Jul 20 19:07:39 2015 UTC,Kind of like playing southsea deckhand and then breaking your weapon.
hearthstone,3dy61t,BokiBurek,22,Tue Jul 21 00:42:24 2015 UTC,"They nerfed Leeroy and after that they nerfed Gadgetzan with Miracle Rogue, so I guess they will nerf burst first and then card draw. I think changing Frothing to only gain attack from your cards would be a more appropriate nerf that wouldn't kill the deck but it would solve the issue of not playing minions just like with the Buzzard nerf."
hearthstone,3dy61t,raichudoggy,66,Mon Jul 20 16:33:56 2015 UTC,"to be fair, they probably didn't Nerf Gadgetzan because of Miracle Rogue, which pretty much fell over and died after the Leeroy nerf. They nerfed him because Spare parts + Him would be OP as hell for all classes."
hearthstone,3dy61t,BokiBurek,11,Mon Jul 20 17:53:12 2015 UTC,"Good point, I didn't actually play at the time of Miracle Rogue, so I didn't think of that. I still think nerfing Frothing would be the way to go from what Blizzard did in the past."

hearthstone,3dy61t,BestMundoNA,7,Mon Jul 20 19:19:44 2015 UTC,"But miracle with southsea+faceless or malygod rogue were both viable but not broken, it was the addition of spare parts which scared blizzard into nerfing gadgetzan :["
hearthstone,3dy61t,sceptic62,5,Mon Jul 20 22:43:32 2015 UTC,"I would much prefer they nerf burst consistency than burst itself. All combo decks are generally tight on space and change in their lists, so if you nerf their key burst pieces, it might just roll over and die. However, if you nerf the consistency of their burst, it still makes the deck fun and playable, but not as cancerous as before."

Hearthstone is really a rock-paper-scissor game, like it or not, and priest is horrible against combo decks - you can't even tech for it. Priests, by nature, excel in the mid to late game where they establish board control, and have absolutely no burst damage outside of Velen/MB priest, which is mediocre at best. Priest in particular excels vs midrange and agro decks, is 50/50 or unfavored vs control decks, and loses to combo.  It's just how it is, priest always struggled against miracle rogue, oil rogue, freeze mage, combo warlock, midrange/fast druid.. because of the slow nature of priest play it gives these decks more than enough time to draw their combo without feeling pressured. So while Patron warrior is an amazing deck, possibly slightly OP, it's also countered by decks such as control warrior and handlock, among others."

Patron Warrior has way more activators than the ones used in the example posted. It has amazing card draw, good early game thanks to weapons (death's bite also doubling as an activator), and great survivability.  The biggest thing for me is that the combo gets even stronger if you play minions out. So the ""counter"" is to not play anything, but as this example shows you can even die from full health if you don't. A deck that gets stronger by the other spawning minions should not be able to OTK on an empty board."

Playing a slower control deck is putting yourself at a disadvantage now because you don't have the burst potential that most popular decks do. It's not a weakness of a deck, its a weakness of an entire playstyle (and incidentally, invalidates way the game was meant to be played according to blizzard--big minion vs. minion trading).  To make it worse for control, even if you stabilize in the late-game most decks are running Big Fun Hunter: Summon Jungle Panther, Destroy Dr Boom or destroy your opponent's morale & win the game if they played a 8-9 mana minion.  HS is simply fundamentally broken and flawed right now until they make some significant balance changes to GvG/BRM cards, BGH and burst combos."

hearthstone,3dy61t,Cow_God,16,Mon Jul 20 22:05:50 2015 UTC,"I don't see an issue, actually.  It is a card game where the people dictate the meta.  The designers can say it is all about trading big minions, but it isn't actually how they designed it.     There are few good health replenishing mechanics. Big Game Hunter has been in the game since the beginning. Efficiency is rewarded, and control spells aren't always efficient. Combos have to be drawn into, so card draw is key. having decks that can work with anything is an advantage.   When you have all these factored in, the game isn't meant to be 30 minute long games of trading big guys tactically.  It should be fast, frantic, and simple.  The wombo combo OTK decks are great when they work, but the OP is just forgetting the 3-4 times he faced this same deck with some other deck and trounced it.  I play patron plenty, I play other decks because I get sick of losing 2 games to faster decks and then when I do finally get my combo to work I get whispers calling me an ""asshole who has no skill."" I have a Paladin Control Deck that shuts down patron a lot and another that is just made for fun that also has murdered patron because the poor opponent has to respond before their combo ever shows up and aren't able to recover.  Why is a game flawed when it plays well?  Because some people want a game with huge minions on the field?  I want smaller ones.  Why should my game be less valid than the big minion one?"

This is true for shit like direct damage priest, malygos hunter and the old math warrior. This is not true for patron warrior. I'm not trying to be an ass, but if you're losing games to 'faster decks' you're playing patron wrong. The deck has gnomish inventors, acolytes, battle rages, slams, you're talking about almost 1/3 of the deck being devoted to cheap draw and cycle. Then you have thaurissan to make your combo cheaper and bigger. As demonstrated above you can hit 35 damage with one frothing. It's like 50+ with two. Then you've got unstable ghouls, win axes, armorsmiths and armor up, all of which are extremely good against those fast decks you're losing to. This is a deck that is   Faster than miracle Has double, quadruple the burst of miracle Has more draw than miracle Has more win conditions than miracle Is more forgiving than miracle   This deck is so good you are basically required to bring it to conquest events. The hardest counter to this deck at the moment is the turn timer. If nozdormu didn't make you skip your next turn if your opponent decided to play a lot of animations, it might just be the strongest counter to this deck. But right now the only way to really counter a patron warrior is to just pray he can't plan out his turn before rope."

hearthstone,3dy61t,BCP27,10,Mon Jul 20 20:57:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I find that the best way to deal with these OTK combos that you hold in your hand would be if blizzard added hand disruption to the game. A simple four or five mama neutral minion with Battlecry - your opponent discards a card at random would enable us to do something to these extreme decks. It would have been good against miracle rogue, it will be good against patron, and it might even do things against agro decks like face hunter. But it isn't extremely format changing. Thoughts?"
hearthstone,3dy61t,Powatanner,9,Mon Jul 20 17:54:28 2015 UTC,"Well, Blizzard wanted the game to not have disruption mechanics like that, which inherently makes strong combo decks way better than in a game where there are things like instants. They either stick with their initial design philosophy and continue to attempt to keep combo decks in check with nerfs, even though they totally buffed them in the last adventure, or they conceed and implement more disruption.  I'd bet they stick with not having disruption like discarding an opponent's card for now. They closest they get are neutral legendaries that provide some disincentive to casting spells, or straight up stop them for a turn.   The lack of good disruption mechanics are why things like snipe saw legit play during the miracle days. Some hunters have even teched it in when their ladder is too Patron heavy."
hearthstone,3dy61t,i_dont_wash_my_hands,4,Mon Jul 20 18:56:30 2015 UTC,Blizzard has stated that they do not want to create any ability of discarding your opponent's cards. But maybe being able to freeze cards in your opponent's hand might be interesting? A minion or spell could 'freeze' (or a different verb) a random card in your opponent's hand so that it couldn't be played their next turn. It's more RNG and it could work to stall your opponent's strategy.

Many people have called for you to be unable to use those if you don't have cards in your hand to discard, or to even discard them from your deck directly. (God help you if you draw your needed Doomguard lethal as the second to last card in your deck, though.)  Not super relevant, I guess, just funny that you explicitly mention working around the drawback of discarding if somebody else does it to you, when that's something everybody else hates about those cards."

I know a few good players, and you see the difference, I don't touch the deck because I know I suck at that kind of stuff, but when I play vs them, there is a world of difference...   The same people understimate how much a small change can impact on a deck, just taking away a 1-3% of a deck winratio, is a huge deal, and can make it from OP, to strong, or even okay. For example, leeroy being a 5 minion attack at 4 mana, would have meant 3 less damage in miracle wombo combo, it would still be strong, but that 1-2-3 less damage, is enough to make it lose a few games, reducing the winratio, and basically reducing the viability of the deck."

hearthstone,3dy61t,massbrowsing,3,Tue Jul 21 02:27:55 2015 UTC,"It's simple, once a minion has more than 3 attack it loses charge. Just like when Tundra Rhino dies, (all beasts lose charge) and when a weapon breaks, Southsea Deckhand loses charge. When the conditions granting charge are no longer met, the creature loses charge.  Take it from a ""when another creature enters the battlefield with 3 or less attack"" effect to ""creatures with 3 attack or less gain"" effect. It pretty much removes the simple OTK in the deck. The combo might change, but it will be considerably less consistent, even with Thaurissan."

Even with the threat of execute, you had 3 mana left over from your last turn and could have at least had a deathlord out there preventing a 100% walkover.  Patron warrior is and awesome deck, and very strong right now. It is easily countered by midrange hunter, control warrior and even control priest like yours with smart plays.  Sometimes though, they just get the draw they need. I have played Combo Druid for a while now and the same thing can be said about my combo. If I have every piece in hand and a 1 turn Emperor discount I can dish out 23 damage. Sure it's not 35, but there are a lot more pieces in Patron Warrior that can put you at absurd amounts of damage."

hearthstone,3dy4yr,Twisted_100,135,Mon Jul 20 14:55:16 2015 UTC,This is actually a really good point.

hearthstone,3dy4yr,Randomd0g,90,Mon Jul 20 16:35:47 2015 UTC,Or maybe the inverse: You can now target randomized spells and all targeted spells are randomized. Would make for some pretty awesome chaos.

hearthstone,3dy4yr,ratz30,13,Mon Jul 20 16:51:03 2015 UTC,"To me the random hitting was because of being two headed, and not because of intelligence. Boulderfist is one headed, so he's less likely to decide to do something different."

Two heads technically make an ogre smarter, however both heads think of themselves as separate entities and may disagree on what to do. (How this works with controlling the body is unknown.) Reference the Ogri'la ogres for this, where I believe you actually had to talk to individual heads because one could do a thing the other could not. I know for sure that one head regularly sent you to the other on the same body.  That's even referenced in Hearthstone, when one Ogre says ""Oops"" while triggering, while Ogre Ninja's heads disagree and his second head changes the target of the attack."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Torakaa,151,Tue Jul 21 00:28:08 2015 UTC,Well it's even better than Force Tank: MAX in most cases... for 2 less mana. Makes it a bit too good to be true.
hearthstone,3dy4yr,clarares,68,Mon Jul 20 15:01:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed, too good to be true. Even having 6 attack instead of 7 is a huge advantage (to duck under the BGH )"

hearthstone,3dy4yr,ME24saken,14,Mon Jul 20 17:32:45 2015 UTC,"Just because they don't make cards like 4 mana 5/6 vanilla, doesn't mean there isn't a massive power creep. Before Nax some considered Harvest Golem op, because there was no easy way to remove it. Nerubian Egg, Creeper and Shredder kinda set a new standard to stickiness. Someone from Blizzard said at one point, that it's okay to have dumpster cards in order to teach new players how to pick good cards and it's okay to make strictly better cards than those (or something similar bs), I think Boulderfist and Force Tank fall into that category."

It's interesting because players have always assumed that Blizzard wouldn't release cards that are strictly speaking better than already existing once up until GvG. They justified it by saying that War Golem was never played anyway, so it would be silly to restrict design choices based on something like that. Although Ogre is seldom played, at least in the competitive sphere of the community, it has always been regarded as a late-game yeti, often included as a late-game drop in beginner/basic lists, so Blizzard is slowly stampeding over the basic cards and crushing whatever possibility they had to be used by anyone than the utmost beginners EDIT: if this leak turns out to be real."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Kordesii,46,Mon Jul 20 15:36:39 2015 UTC,It's a staple card in Arena.
hearthstone,3dy4yr,gulasch_hanuta,21,Mon Jul 20 15:50:05 2015 UTC,The game needs good cards in arena at the common level. MTG has some cards that are fantastic in limited and straight shit in constructed.
hearthstone,3dy4yr,kingoftown,15,Mon Jul 20 16:16:22 2015 UTC,"Blizzard still hasn't balanced Dr. Boom at all, not even slightly or a small bit.

hearthstone,3dy4yr,PhoenixPills,33,Mon Jul 20 16:33:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it's a fake or not, but straight up better cards at a power creep this fast really hurts not only new players but arena as well.

hearthstone,3dy4yr,Djief,2,Mon Jul 20 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"I guess Fjola would be fine at 7 mana. I think at 6 mana this card is somewhat insane. A ""rough"" estimate yields: 13 points of value from the stats, ~2 from the divine shield, 1-2 extra from the effect makes this card worth about 7 mana."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,HS_CoConi,98,Mon Jul 20 21:42:35 2015 UTC,Anyone else curious what that ''Aura Mastery' card might be?  Edit: And Fordragon Blades.
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Lionelle1991,35,Mon Jul 20 14:30:02 2015 UTC,"In WoW Aura Mastery boosted the power of your auras, giving you:   +Armour to all friendlies +elemental magic resist to all friendlies Uninteruptable spellcasting to all friendlies   depending which aura you had up. I'm guessing for Hearthstone this will heal/buff/taunt up your minions? Something like Enhance'o'mechano, but without a body so it'll probably be more powerful a buff.  +1/+1 and taunt + divine shield to all minions?"
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Kandiru,8,Mon Jul 20 15:52:41 2015 UTC,Your minions cannot be silenced would be pretty neat.
hearthstone,3dy4yr,wruffx,15,Mon Jul 20 16:59:42 2015 UTC,Un-Silencing should be a thing.
hearthstone,3dy4yr,NinjaRobotPilot,2,Mon Jul 20 18:01:29 2015 UTC,"But what happens if a minion that's taken some non-lethal damage gets silenced, then gets buffed from a different source, takes some more non-lethal damage, then gets 'unsilenced'?  What state does it return to?  That would require some really complicated coding and a lot of potential bug-causing interactions - realistically, it'll probably be too complicated to implement"
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Make_me_watch,2,Tue Jul 21 01:51:19 2015 UTC,"If you Argus a minion from 5 to 6 health, then it takes one damage back down to 5, then gets silenced, it remains at 5 health. I would imagine similar mechanics to that. As for undoing outside effects, maybe it would just be limited to re-enabling card text."

hearthstone,3dy4yr,Shahjian,67,Mon Jul 20 15:25:05 2015 UTC,If they're real leaks:  Someone took out their camera real quick and snagged some photos when no one was looking  If they're fake:  Making a photo of a screen makes it look more convincing and the picture gets slightly blurred (or more than slightly) which makes it harder to see the details that would otherwise reveal that it's fake.
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Droggelbecher,24,Mon Jul 20 17:41:36 2015 UTC,"IIRC someone suggested that they (the testers) might be trying to prevent getting caught while doing it, so they have to take the pictures kind of hastily. Take that with a grain of salt, though."

hearthstone,3dy4yr,SigurdZS,15,Mon Jul 20 14:30:50 2015 UTC,The icon behind the text is new. All other 'leaks' had the symbol from the classic set.
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Driox,61,Mon Jul 20 14:34:01 2015 UTC,Notice the blue and purple splotches  Now notice the same splotches with a different contrast
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Mezmorizor,5,Mon Jul 20 15:01:15 2015 UTC,Can't stop the hype train. Only a couple more days to confirm/deny all the rumors.
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Alarid,30,Mon Jul 20 17:45:25 2015 UTC,And? Making a little icon like that in photoshop is not a lot of work. Then you just cut out the text and layer it over the icon on the card.
hearthstone,3dy4yr,SigurdZS,28,Mon Jul 20 14:36:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah but you're getting into territory of what is easier:   This being real This being a really good fake.   And I know we've seen impressive fakes (Smash Bros), but with the icon on the card, the different Paladin Hero and the third picture from supposedly a trailer I would lean towards it being real.  I won't eat my shoe if it's fake, though."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Droggelbecher,13,Mon Jul 20 15:03:26 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if these were fake, some people will put a lot of effort into their false claims if it means they can fool a bunch of people."

hearthstone,3dy4yr,Driox,36,Mon Jul 20 14:19:55 2015 UTC,"Well I'm convinced.   Also, it's only 2 days from announcement, so this could be an intentional hype building leak."

hearthstone,3dy4yr,Driox,57,Mon Jul 20 14:27:38 2015 UTC,"Also, there are currently no cards between Emperor Thaurissan and Frost Elemental in the collection.

Not enough to bet on it or anything, but it shows a little more effort than your run of the mill fake post."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,LeandroCOH,113,Mon Jul 20 15:34:44 2015 UTC,Golden Emperor is between the two.

hearthstone,3dy4yr,Jambeard,482,Mon Jul 20 14:22:14 2015 UTC,Yeah it's not like there's ever been a legendary that's the same as a no text minion but with OP text Kappa
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Azureraider,227,Mon Jul 20 14:33:25 2015 UTC,War Golem is a shitty card. Boulderfist Ogre is not. This better not be real.
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Jambeard,116,Mon Jul 20 14:41:21 2015 UTC,In constructed maybe. In arena this would be pants on head retarded. Imagine Kel'Thuzad but you need nothing on the board
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Alarid,20,Mon Jul 20 14:45:11 2015 UTC,They need to balance it as a 7/7.
hearthstone,3dy4yr,CursedLlama,4,Mon Jul 20 17:27:34 2015 UTC,Ugh here comes the double BGH decks.
hearthstone,3dy4yr,HaphStealth,32,Mon Jul 20 19:45:08 2015 UTC,I agree. War Golem doesn't even surpass the vanilla test. Boulderfist Ogre does. This would be the first neutral card to both surpass the vanilla test and then additionally have a positive (not symmetrical or detrimental) ability. Though you could argue Dr. Boom is 9/9 surpassing the vanilla test but that's why he's considered op.
hearthstone,3dy4yr,madog1418,9,Mon Jul 20 14:46:24 2015 UTC,"You can't really do the 9/9 thing. If it were a 9/9 one polymorph could remove the entire creature, or alternatively remove an 8/8 and stay alive."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Scottismyname,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:35 2015 UTC,"War Golem is perfectly fine in Arena.  It's not top tier, but to call it shitty is a bit much.  Of course the ogre is better though."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Tafts_Bathtub,43,Mon Jul 20 16:39:43 2015 UTC,"IF you compare Dr.Boom to War Golem and this minion to Boulderfist Ogre, the 2 boom bots are much better than this ability. There is no easy way to completely kill Dr Boom, while I can think of a lot of ways to kill this minion and gain tempo (hex, polymorph, PW: Shield, double 1 DMG + execute)."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,HaphStealth,47,Mon Jul 20 14:44:18 2015 UTC,How does Power word shield kill it?
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Gramaje,49,Mon Jul 20 15:00:34 2015 UTC,"He probably messed up PW:S with SW:P, all while meaning Shadow Word: Death."

hearthstone,3dy4yr,ChronosReturns,57,Mon Jul 20 15:11:31 2015 UTC,Why are you smiling?
hearthstone,3dy4yr,86com,8,Mon Jul 20 15:33:35 2015 UTC,"In terms of their abilities this is true, but the main body of the card is too strong, it starts out with a divine shield and requires more mana to kill it. Other than hex and polymorph, which are the main cards that take down big guys, it is a huge threat that cannot be BGHed, which is a major card atm. So while the bombs are OP themselves, it is still the body of a war golem or 7 mana two boom bots plus a BGH on your opponents side, compared to a body of a boulderfist ogre plus a divine shield."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,AoRaJohnJohn,5,Mon Jul 20 14:55:26 2015 UTC,"IF you compare Dr.Boom to War Golem and this minion to Boulderfist Ogre, the 2 boom bots are much better than this ability.   Sure, 6/7 for 6 with 2 Boom Bots would've been even more OP, but keep in mind that Boulderfist is almost-playable while War Golem is a complete trash in current meta."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,alphyna,5,Mon Jul 20 15:20:14 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that i haven't been able to find this art of her anywhere else, so it looks custom made for Hearthstone. That doesn't mean the stats are correct though."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,drewson87,27,Mon Jul 20 15:24:02 2015 UTC,"Fiola Lightbane would be absolutely fucking insane in Arena, true, but as for Constructed... I'm wondering what decks would play it (apart from Druid, maybe). It's just a slow and vanilla-ish super-value minion, isn't it? Like Cairne? And no one plays Cairne."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,OhYaaah,68,Mon Jul 20 14:59:22 2015 UTC,No one plays cairne because 4 attack doesn't get it done anymore as a 6 drop.
hearthstone,3dy4yr,thegooblop,5,Mon Jul 20 15:15:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But it's still a good card though. It dodge Bgh, has excellent stats repartition and its divine shield shenanigans might be great.  If you're gonna trade into it with creatures and/or damage spells you have to remove divine shield + 7 health every time. And you pretty much have to unless you're putting on heavy pressure. If you don't, Lion will just kill your guys without suffering any damage turn after turn. Tempo machine.  Even with a silence you're still facing a 6/7 6-drop. Which means if you're playing against it on turn 6 you're automatically going to loose ground if you have to spend mana silencing it.  The only valuable way to remove it is with hard removals such as polymorph, hex, assassinate (which isn't played), SW:D and the like. Shield slam or execute aren't that good against it since you're going to need an extra source of damage/silence to get through the shield which reduces its efficiently drastically.  Also 6 mana still isn't too slow against most decks. Problem is, it is against agro. It also doesn't help you stabilize/secure the board quickly against it.  In a slower meta though, I can see it working in midrange/control decks. Well, that is, if midrange decks ever become viable. Maybe other cards will help.  The main difference with Cairne, I believe, is that Cairne's stats just suck. Cairne puts too little pressure on the board and can't trade up well against most 5+ drops (4 attack is a big deal). He's super sticky, which is why his stats are sub-par, but he's sticking around not doing enough most of the time.  Of course, all of that only matters if this isn't a fake. And I tend to be on the skeptical side."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,TBNecksnapper,2,Mon Jul 20 16:04:08 2015 UTC,"It would be played in a lot of decks. There aren't many good 6 drops, Sylvannas and Emperor Thaurissan are good but not every deck wants them, and nobody picks poor Hogger or Cairne. It's a MASSIVE value card, people would play it for the simple fact that most classes can't even deal with it. Hex, Polymorph, SW:D, and Assassinate are the only things that guarantee a 1:1 (but if this IS a real card, I guarantee the powercreep will also introduce new cards like these for the other classes). If you're playing against Patron Warrior, they would have to pop the divine shield, deal damage again, and THEN execute Fiola all in the same turn, because the shield comes back if you don't. BGH won't cut it, so some decks just can't deal with this card at all without losing a ton of tempo and value.  Looking at combos, this will absolutely be in my Paladin deck that runs 2 Blood Knight. The deck isn't too good now in the late game (it mostly relies on stealing the shield from Minibot/Annoyotron/Argent Squire for huge early pressure, and the deck runs 2 of each as well), but being able to drop a 6/7 that regains divine shield every turn and a 6/6 (at least) all for 9 mana is huge."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,xbythunder,8,Mon Jul 20 19:31:06 2015 UTC,"nobody plays Boulderfist Ogre any more, better than not played doesn't mean OP."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,TBNecksnapper,13,Mon Jul 20 14:55:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think that Fjona would even be played, real talk."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,Sugusino,10,Mon Jul 20 14:35:35 2015 UTC,"maybe not, high mana minions that don't have an immediate ability really need to be way better than the ""vanilla test"" to be useful. This may indeed not even be enough!"
hearthstone,3dy4yr,thevdude,4,Mon Jul 20 15:06:13 2015 UTC,Actually I don't think there's any vanilla minions without text played competitively. Maybe spider tank if you don't consider tribal as text.

hearthstone,3dy4yr,caedicus,6,Mon Jul 20 15:06:36 2015 UTC,It's not that hard to take out a Divine Shield. Current Tempo Mages could take out that thing pretty quickly with ping or Flamewaker.
hearthstone,3dy4yr,acamas,4,Mon Jul 20 16:30:10 2015 UTC,"This card would cause problems for Patron Warriors though, which are pretty common these days.  In order to pull of an execute on this minion with a clear board, they would have to use two of their activator cards (whirlwind, slam, cruel taskmaster, inner rage), which they generally need for their combos."
hearthstone,3dy4yr,PYJX,3,Mon Jul 20 17:32:20 2015 UTC,It's not that hard to take out a Divine Shield.   Most classes can't just drop 2 mana to 'ping' it though.

It's a 6 mana investment for a body that does literally nothing the turn it is played. Granted, it can generate insane value over the course of a few turns but considering the current meta, aggro decks will just end up ignoring it entirely while pushing for more face damage. This card is insane in a control-heavy meta but it doesn't do much as long as people follow the mantra ""the face is the place""."

EDIT2: I might be going crazy. I remember seeing a post that showed if there was 3 options, Foe Reaper was picked most of all other Legendaries (maybe specifically in 12 win runs?) but I can't find that post anywhere.

You know that Lifecoach has to swing Death's Bite to into a giant unless he has two executes, so how can you make sure that he dies as a result from that?"
hearthstone,3e3npj,hslimsch,2,Tue Jul 21 18:39:39 2015 UTC,I think Trump is good enough to figure that out but for some reason he wasn't paying attention this game.

Frothing would still have more than enough attack to kill Trump at 14 hp.  Edit: Screenshot of situation from Lifecoach's perspective just before swinging Death's Bite. Had Trump played Dark Bomb last turn, Lifecoach would be at 8 hp and his Frothing at 11 attack. Just sacrifice Emperor and Armormsmith into giant, which puts you at 10 health, swing and execute, all taunts are down and Frothing should be at 20 attack."

hearthstone,3e2pzg,philly3D,5,Tue Jul 21 14:34:58 2015 UTC,A simple no legendaries or a limit on the dust would do the job. Problem with this is that you with make people play aggro decks as Zoo/hunter are cheap and does not need legendaries.  One option could be to only use one of each card. This really makes all the current net decks impossible to make but guess people with a large collection will still have an advantage.  Lastly something along the lines of the first challenge stone where only creatures with an odd number attack and spells with an even number mana cost could be used. Again people with a larger collection will have an advantage.  I do not think you can completely level the playing field but you can reward creative people and stop the amount of brainless net decking.
hearthstone,3e2pzg,Nanobach,2,Tue Jul 21 15:06:35 2015 UTC,yeah ladder decks (and net decks) are exactly what I'm trying to discourage. I like the idea of not having doubles.

hearthstone,3dylei,CobaltCannon,112,Mon Jul 20 16:35:53 2015 UTC,How about...  Command: Kill  3 mana (spell)  Deal 3 damage; deal 5 damage if you control a mech.
hearthstone,3dylei,TimedforPress,44,Mon Jul 20 17:32:22 2015 UTC,"Good idea, but I'd prefer Mech Hunter to have a different style of play. Like:  Command: Kill  3 Mana - Inflict 3 damage to a minion. If you control a Mech, destroy it instead.  Comparable to Crush, it would give Mech Hunter a directed version of Deadly Shot. Powerful for board control but no inherent rush value. Good for some later game Mech Hunter builds that exist, and even the faster ones that want to get by a big wall."
hearthstone,3dylei,watchout4shredder,9,Mon Jul 20 17:53:36 2015 UTC,what? have you ever heard about thing called balance?
hearthstone,3dylei,aWe34,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:18:35 2015 UTC,"For most classes I'd agree with you. For Hunter, who has essentially no card draw, a one for one isn't as amazing. Also it's just that, a one for one. While it's great Tempo swing if your opponent focuses on high cost cards it's a bad trade against any aggro oriented deck. The card this most compares to is Shadow Word: Death, though that's in a class that can cycle and draw quite a few cards in one turn. Having a Mech is easier than having a having a damaged minion like in Crush, but it requires a Hunter deck to specifically focus on Mechs to get good mileage. Maybe SW:D for Mech Hunter could end up being broken, but my reasoning is that it would be a great card in a style of play Hunter is weak in(lategame) and in a currently underplayed Hunter archetype (Mech). I've gotten off Deadly Shots on my lategame Hunter for big Tempo swings and it rarely did that much for me, honestly."
hearthstone,3dylei,watchout4shredder,-3,Tue Jul 21 19:05:40 2015 UTC,Why would hunter not play an aggressive style?
hearthstone,3dylei,day_break,8,Mon Jul 20 23:03:53 2015 UTC,"So they can stall til the late game, while constantly throwing the tap timer in their opponents faces."
hearthstone,3dylei,james9075,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:29:14 2015 UTC,again. why would you not play an aggressive style as hunter. the hero power alone is amazing for aggressive and terrible for board/control. that is the reason non-aggro and non-aggro-tempo decks are not even close to t3.
hearthstone,3dylei,day_break,11,Tue Jul 21 01:29:41 2015 UTC,"Hunter has very viable board control and tempo options, such as Freezing Trap, Explosive Trap, and Gladiators Longboard. The reason why aggro decks are much preferred over control styles for Hunter are because cards like Kill Command and Quickshot are just way too good not to be played, and are run over the control variants. This is why he suggested the Command:Kill card, which would provide just as much incentive to play control. I agree that hunters hero power does not contribute to board control at all, and doesn't synergize well with a control style of play, but again, it can act as a fuse for long matchups. Just as warriors hero power gives him 2hp, hunters hero power takes away 2hp.  Edit: I meant to say Explosive Shot, which is a more direct control spell. Also, I like longboarding, but I meant longbow :)"

hearthstone,3dylei,Rpgguyi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:30:57 2015 UTC,"the issue with the 'fuse for long matchups' is that the 2/turn is not enough to race aggro decks and it also insists on starting each turn down 2 mana in order to keep the fuse going. this means that you will lose to tempo decks and struggle against midrange and aggro decks.   the deck style you are describing is anti-control.   on a side note, freezing trap is a terrible control card. it is an amazing tempo card, which is why it is used. explosive trap is ok against aggro but becomes quickly irrelevant when faced with things like dr boom. gladiators longbow is 7 mana, far too high to be reasonably used."
hearthstone,3dylei,day_break,4,Tue Jul 21 03:18:59 2015 UTC,"IIRC, hunter was initially designed FOR board control and the hero power was supposed to apply pressure to the opponent. Then the community played around with decks and preferred rushing over a stable board"

hearthstone,3dylei,day_break,3,Tue Jul 21 03:20:07 2015 UTC,"This isn't /r/competitiveHS friend, this is the Hearthstone subreddit. People are allowed to talk about potential deck styles without having to wonder if they're the absolute best option all the time.   Besides, as others have said, hunter could potentially be one of the best control classes. They don't even necessarily need grinder cards to win the lategame like control/dragon warrior, since their hero power puts 7/9 of the classes on a strict timer. If they stall long enough, they win by default. The problem is they just don't have enough control cards for it to be viable... yet. Mark my words, hunter will have a semi-viable control archetype soon."
hearthstone,3dylei,Pseudogenesis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:15:45 2015 UTC,"'semi-viable' is the most openly worded phrase. you are basically saying people could play a hunter control deck and win a game with it. yes that has happened, is happening, and will probably happen again. that does not make it a viable or reasonable deck by any means. also ""hero power puts 7/9 of the classes on a strict timer"" is assuming you will hero power each turn. this is a bad assumption."

hearthstone,3dylei,james9075,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:51:23 2015 UTC,"Why do you have such a bone to pick? I don't even know why you're arguing what you're arguing right now. But I'm in the mood to discuss so wall of text it is.    'semi-viable' is the most openly worded phrase. you are basically saying people could play a hunter control deck and win a game with it.   No I'm not. I'm saying you can consistently do well with it. Maybe it won't be a top tier deck, but it will eventually be one of the decks people will actually consider running into when they queue against a hunter. Right now that's not the case.    yes that has happened, is happening, and will probably happen again. that does not make it a viable or reasonable deck by any means.   I never said anything along these lines. I said it would eventually be a viable archetype for hunter.    also ""hero power puts 7/9 of the classes on a strict timer"" is assuming you will hero power each turn. this is a bad assumption.   No it's not. This is one of the core foundations of Hearthstone's control archetypes. The game will go on for a long time, you will not be spending the maximum amount of mana every turn, and you will be squeezing the maximum amount of value possible out of your cards and hero power. Control warriors play relatively few cards and hero power almost every turn. Control priests play relatively few cards outside of big swing turns and use their hero power almost every turn on minions or face. Even more control oriented midrange decks like midrange paladin very often seek to use hero power in place of playing a card where it is permissable.  Control hunter uses efficient removal and minions to try and control the board, but it almost never spends all its mana on cards, just like all the other control archetypes. If you're spending all your mana on cards every turn as a control deck throughout the game then you're either doing it wrong or playing an atypical/hybrid control deck.   I'm not saying the ONLY thing the hunter needs to close out a game is hero power. I'm saying that while other classes, even control classes, can't quickly close the game with their hero powers, the Hunter can. That, in addition to the hunter's other good control cards, is what leads me to believe it will be a viable control deck someday."
hearthstone,3dylei,Pseudogenesis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:55:28 2015 UTC,People play midrange Hunter to legend all the time. Yes control Hunter isn't viable really yet but midrange ekes out ton of value by using it's hero power each turn to put its opponent on a clock.
hearthstone,3dylei,dollenrm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:14:44 2015 UTC,Hunters hero power gains value as the game progresses it puts your opponent on a clock and the further in the game the more likely you'll have spare mana to continuously do 2 damage to the face. You stall out til the mid late game with freezing traps etc then use your highmanes and other great damage cards to swing face after controlling the board until mid game.
hearthstone,3dylei,dollenrm,2,Tue Jul 21 04:12:28 2015 UTC,"Hunter decks almost always rush at a certain point to end the game, but not all of them do it instantly. Variants like Mech tend to want to flood the board then beat you down after Metaltooth Leaper is dropped."

hearthstone,3dylei,CobaltCannon,6,Mon Jul 20 18:40:13 2015 UTC,"What's the downside of cobra shot? Is it just the initial three damage isn't enough for 5 mana? It seems to me that for a face hunter deck it might be decent enough to get rid of a 3 health minion and do three damage to the face. I see a lot of people disliking the card though, so I assume there are just better options out there."
hearthstone,3dylei,DeandreDeangelo,17,Mon Jul 20 19:17:32 2015 UTC,"It's just not good value. Think of it this way: the damage it deals to a minion is comparable to Quick Shot, while the face damage is almost a Hero Power, just slightly better. With that in mind, the combo of Quick Shot and Hero Power is 4 mana. One more mana for one extra face damage as well as the loss of utility of using either half separately makes this card too hard to use. Not to mention, using it in an aggressive deck means A: you're spending an entire turn in the last half of the game doing 3 damage to the enemy hero, which doesn't help close it out if it takes that long, and B: you're spending a card slot on something that's dead if drawn before turn 5 (4 with coin), something aggressive decks often can't risk.  TL;DR: good in some cases, but overall not good for value/tempo.  Edit: typos"
hearthstone,3dylei,zqmfbg,2,Mon Jul 20 19:52:46 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the quick shot hero power combo ""prevents"" the use of hero power again, whereas cobra shot doesn't. I still agree with you though, it's just not a good card."

hearthstone,3dylei,UpgradeNova,2,Mon Jul 20 19:35:33 2015 UTC,3 damage to face = sinister strike = 1 mana = bad = 0.75 of value.  3 damage targeted = dark bomb = bad frostbolt = 1.75 of value.  Cobrashot = 0.75 + 1.75 = 2.5 + 1 value for comboing effects = 3.5 value for 5 mana.  To make cobrashot balanced at 5 mana = add 1.5 value of face damage or direct damage.  Example: cobrastrike = fireball + sinisterstrike = 4 + 0.75 + 1 = 5.75 - 0.75 of value = deal 5 damage to a minion and 3 to face.

hearthstone,3dylei,HelloLeeroy,18,Mon Jul 20 16:35:57 2015 UTC,It's very good. We just need a two or so new cards with the beast tag or synergy that are at the same power level with houndmaster or highmane.
hearthstone,3dylei,Sugusino,10,Mon Jul 20 17:44:42 2015 UTC,Imagine Houndmaster with Druid of the Flame...
hearthstone,3dylei,pokokichi,4,Tue Jul 21 04:13:15 2015 UTC,Imagine it with a 4 mana 2/7! Even better!
hearthstone,3dylei,harmlangwerden,2,Tue Jul 21 11:32:35 2015 UTC,Snapjaw + Houndmaster saw a ton of play in the beta. I remember thinking it was an insanely strong combo.
hearthstone,3dylei,Tofu24,2,Tue Jul 21 12:15:16 2015 UTC,"On a serious note, Druid of the Flame would be much more OP in na Hunter deck because you can drop it at turn 3 then follow with Houndmaster."

hearthstone,3dylei,pete_8789,5,Tue Jul 21 08:12:12 2015 UTC,"I think that it nicely defines the line where P ends and OP starts. Any better and the card probably would be considered OP but, as it stands, it's very well balanced."
hearthstone,3dylei,anrwlias,2,Mon Jul 20 20:28:17 2015 UTC,I personally think that this card is overpowered. We are just seeing it with great success in midrange hunter because face hunter and UTH hunter were too strong/popular.
hearthstone,3dylei,kthnxbai9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:57:51 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's strong. Quite strong. The problem is that a) there are tons of cards that are WAY stronger and b) there aren't enough good beast cards to put in Hunter. Since the bar for ""balanced"" has been set at ""overpowered"", this card is just ""sometimes good in some decks."""
hearthstone,3dylei,Pseudogenesis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:44:47 2015 UTC,Are you kidding? Every midrange hunter ~rank 4 runs this card and its by far the most popular hunter deck.
hearthstone,3dylei,lvl5dagon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:07:58 2015 UTC,"Well alright, I didn't know it was so popular in midrange hunter right now, but to be fair that is only one hunter archetype, and I've definitely seen its popularity wax and wane. It's also only a one-of in every decklist I saw it in."
hearthstone,3dylei,Pseudogenesis,2,Tue Jul 21 04:15:12 2015 UTC,"I've seen lots of midrange hunter lists that run 2 of them right now (they often time cut for example a shredder). I'm a weird guy that prefers to run one houndmaster and double shredder, since I don't like to increase the chance of having to play naked houndmasters. Midrange hunter is also the dominant archetype right now around rank 1 on the EU ladder."
hearthstone,3dylei,VENlVIDlVICl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:38:18 2015 UTC,"That's very odd, I can't imagine choosing to give up a shredder for a second houndmaster. When you compare them, both are a 4 mana 4-3, both are weak to silence, but shredder is stickier and doesn't have to rely on beast synergy. Even when comparing the +2/+2 and taunt versus a random 2 drop I still think I'd prefer the 2 drop. Maybe a tech choice to counter aggro?"
hearthstone,3dylei,Pseudogenesis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:02:34 2015 UTC,"There are lists, that run two houndmasters and no shredder at all. A +2/2 buff on an already sticky beast, that usually comes with charge and requires your opponent to use his silence on it, if it hits highmane, is widely considered stronger, than a random 2 drop.   Between all the webspinners, haunted creepers, that are a pain to remove and animal companions, there will always be a target for the good old houndmaster. It even affects the opponent, when it is not actively in play, by forcing him to deal with your webspinner in the early game."
hearthstone,3dylei,Kharaaz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:20:42 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting that the +2/+2 has charge, but I kinda use your reasoning to justify running one. To answer your question, I guess running 2 might help a bit versus aggro, but I don't think it'll have that big of an impact. The decision between running 1 or 2 is more of a personable thing. Even some pros (e.g. Strifecro and Firebat) are running two, but other pros are running one (I believe Orange?). It depends on several factors: how much do you value the charge, how often do you think it'll be unplayable/how often do you think you have to play it naked, how much do you value the taunt (probably less important), how much do you care that the shredder drop is 100% RNG etc. There are also some, perhaps less obvious things that can play a very small role; a webspinner might not be playable later in the game versus a patron warrior, but it might be playable with a houndmaster buff.  You also have to keep in mind that hunter midrange is a tempo deck. This means that you have to evaluate how much it'll hurt you if you have to keep it the houndmaster in your hand or play a naked one. The tempo gained by playing a non-naked houndmaster is huge though, so running at least one is in my opinion the way to go."
hearthstone,3dylei,VENlVIDlVICl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:36:20 2015 UTC,You're forgetting that the +2/+2 has charge   Very true. Good points all around.
hearthstone,3dylei,Pseudogenesis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:16:02 2015 UTC,"To throw in my lot I'm running 2 shredders and 2 houndmasters in my deck, mostly just to wreck warrior. I'm currently 2 wins from legend too, which is exciting."
hearthstone,3dylei,HelloLeeroy,47,Tue Jul 21 09:54:35 2015 UTC,"A great example of a card with conditional value. If you can trigger its battle-cry its undercosted for what you get, if not its slightly overcosted but not unplayable."
hearthstone,3dylei,a1337noob,4,Mon Jul 20 16:42:27 2015 UTC,I struggle to get a proper grip on when o should play it naked. In fact I have literally just finished a game where I turned down a naked turn 4 Houndmaster and ended up Owl/Houndmastering on Turn 7. It meant the owl was value but I think I lost out on damage overall.
hearthstone,3dylei,Percinho,2,Mon Jul 20 21:32:01 2015 UTC,Its rare. You have enough beasts you can usually afford to wait. I guess if you were desperate for board presence against a slow deck. Its similar to playing SI:7 without combo. I can count on one hand the times it has been correct for me to play either of them naked. Of course I only run one houndmaster so its rare I have it and can't get value.
hearthstone,3dylei,theevilyouknow,3,Tue Jul 21 00:02:51 2015 UTC,"If you can 2+hero on turn 4, that is better than a naked hound master.   A really value 3 might be, like if your opponent just implosioned and you can get a 4-7 UTH, but generally if it's your only 4, just play it rather than lose tempo."
hearthstone,3dylei,syricon,2,Tue Jul 21 03:39:37 2015 UTC,SI:7 is generally the right play on turn 3 if you don't have ERF or Deadly Poison
hearthstone,3dylei,ogliver,79,Tue Jul 21 11:19:29 2015 UTC,I love using it on the Oasis Snapjaw.

hearthstone,3dylei,Kazzack,38,Mon Jul 20 17:40:59 2015 UTC,Dat owl target
hearthstone,3dylei,LazinCajun,16,Mon Jul 20 18:51:45 2015 UTC,"You're right that it's a great owl target, but from a Hunter's perspective that's one less silence for Highmane. Part of the strength of Houndmaster is that it can draw some early removal / silence and clear the way for t6 Highmane t7 Boom."
hearthstone,3dylei,_Gallade,2,Mon Jul 20 19:39:53 2015 UTC,turn 4 houndmaster then next turn loatheb then highmane then boom is the dream
hearthstone,3dylei,ale_mayo_,4,Tue Jul 21 05:04:27 2015 UTC,Once I had a priest drop Cabal the turn after I houndmatered Oasis Snapjaw in the recent brawl. Someone wasn't paying attention that day.
hearthstone,3dylei,raichudoggy,39,Mon Jul 20 17:44:41 2015 UTC,"A little before Naxxramas, Houndmaster was played with River Crocolisk and Snapjaw for the insane value on those beasts in particular. But, after Naxxramas, this card had seen a decline in play, because you need a beast to get full value from him. I like him, but between Piloted Shredder or Chillwind Yeti I prefer those two, because they can be played on Turn 4 without losing value. Most of the times Houndmaster is not a Turn 4 card and forced you to not play on curve, and for Hunter nowadays is so importanto to play on curve with full value. It's good? Absolutely. I'm gonna play it? I don't know. It really depends to the future Beasts creatures and to the future playstyle of Hunter."
hearthstone,3dylei,Tengu-san,30,Mon Jul 20 16:55:48 2015 UTC,"The shredder is the big one. You get the same stats(4/3 and 2/2 on average), but you don't need a beast on the board and you have resistance to board clears. The only thing you miss out on is taunt, but in hunter that isn't a huge concern anyways."
hearthstone,3dylei,Merfen,8,Mon Jul 20 17:41:12 2015 UTC,"In beast decks or beastly arena runs, however, the Houndmaster can get more value since the +2/+2 essentially has charge, since you can use it on a beast before attacking to deal the damage right away. But at the end of the day, they're probably comparable or equal in value."
hearthstone,3dylei,zqmfbg,3,Mon Jul 20 19:58:22 2015 UTC,"I guess my biggest problem is you need that beast, so in a top deck or low card situation the houndmaster is outright worse."
hearthstone,3dylei,Merfen,4,Mon Jul 20 20:11:52 2015 UTC,"It's worse in top deck, but better when you have a beast. It's a little bit worse than shredder ofc, becouse you're gonna not have a beast more often than you're gonna have a beast, but what 4 drop isn't worse than this monster? Even superior yeti can't fight it."
hearthstone,3dylei,JestemKioskiem,3,Tue Jul 21 00:12:09 2015 UTC,"What's being missed here is that the 2/2 houndmaster gives is active RIGHT AWAY.  That means I can t3 a creeper or a spinner+trap or something and then turn 4 slam a 4/3, buff another minion, and do another two to face.  That advances the hunter objective immediately, playing a 4/3 with a deathrattle does not."
hearthstone,3dylei,Jahkral,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:44:03 2015 UTC,This card is the only reason midrange manages 40 percent against face hunter instead 9th only 20.
hearthstone,3dylei,syricon,8,Tue Jul 21 03:44:49 2015 UTC,"JAB's midrange list is basically the standard midrange list nowadays and it runs 2 houndmasters and 1 shredder.  Webspinner lists almost always have double houndmaster, and most decks without webspinners are shifting towards a 'hybrid' style.  With snake trap + double webspinner, the current general midrange lists rarely have to play out a houndmaster without value."
hearthstone,3dylei,yhzh,2,Mon Jul 20 17:45:27 2015 UTC,I cut a houndmaster for a Kezan Mystic. I've definitely won more games thanks to mystic than I've lost because I didn't draw a houndmaster. A lot of times mystic is clutch simply for countering a Kezan Mystic from your opponent. It helps against face hunter too. Steal their explosive trap and develop a 4/3? GG Of course houndmaster is powerful against face hunter as well.
hearthstone,3dylei,theevilyouknow,5,Tue Jul 21 00:11:23 2015 UTC,Hmmm every midrange hunter runs the bloody card.  Era got rank 1 legend with two of them on one hunter deck.  Every midrange list i have seen runs it.
hearthstone,3dylei,NavidadetMortis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:54:38 2015 UTC,"Because in midrange there is less need to curve perfectly in mana every turn. I should specified it, the mana curve discussion is for Hybrid lists of hunter, where you have more need to get all the value in less time. In a normal midrange hunter you can wait to get value with him.I just like hybrid"
hearthstone,3dylei,Tengu-san,2,Mon Jul 20 21:36:28 2015 UTC,Haunted Creeper is an insane Houndmaster target. That card is the reason I run two Houndmasters in my Midrange Hunter.
hearthstone,3dylei,bpat132,2,Mon Jul 20 19:36:40 2015 UTC,"Ya, shredder single handedly killed a lot of 4 mana cards"
hearthstone,3dylei,tion24,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:55 2015 UTC,Its been... ages since Ive seen a yeti on ladder. RIP.
hearthstone,3dylei,mrducky78,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:32:53 2015 UTC,"It bears noting that you get that 2 damage with charge. That often allows for some solid trades the turn its played.  If they use removal on the 4/3 body behind the taunt, that's less removal for the follow up Highmane."
hearthstone,3dylei,Ippildip,2,Tue Jul 21 01:52:42 2015 UTC,i think this card is way better than yeti.  the temposwing when it triggers is really great and can secure board control till the big highmanes/loatheb/boom come out

hearthstone,3dylei,twelfthsphinx,18,Mon Jul 20 17:23:05 2015 UTC,I fatigued a hunter once.  It was a proud moment.
hearthstone,3dylei,dbthelinguaphile,7,Mon Jul 20 18:31:31 2015 UTC,"I've used HM on Maexxna, but only when she popped out of webspinner. It's definitely a sign that the game's gone weird when that's happening, though."

hearthstone,3dylei,ale_mayo_,8,Tue Jul 21 05:31:07 2015 UTC,Can always pull her from Webspinner
hearthstone,3dylei,---reddit_account---,2,Mon Jul 20 17:44:45 2015 UTC,Scary? More like wasteful. She doesn't even benefit from the +2 attack because she has poison already.
hearthstone,3dylei,JessicaSc2,2,Mon Jul 20 18:06:28 2015 UTC,well having to attack a minion that kills anything that doesn't have divine shield and has 10 health is pretty scary
hearthstone,3dylei,sooth_,0,Mon Jul 20 18:21:28 2015 UTC,as opposed to a minion that has 8 hp and kills anything that doesn't have divine shield?

hearthstone,3dylei,JessicaSc2,2,Mon Jul 20 18:33:55 2015 UTC,k
hearthstone,3dylei,Pelleas,2,Mon Jul 20 18:46:02 2015 UTC,"IMO Maexxna just isn't good enough to be included in most decks and the Beast tag isn't enough to redeem it for Hunters. The meta is way too fast for a 6 mana 2/8 with poison to be worthwhile, and even when it isn't, 6 mana for a 2/8 without immediate effect is somewhat lackluster, not to mention that she can be removed by spells. If she was a 5 drop(!) or was a 3/8 so she could at least do a bit more to face and not be Cabal'd, she might see some play IMO. That said, I've been itching to mess around with Beast Hunter again lately, and the Tundra Rhino -> Maexxna combo sounds appealing.   Edit: I managed to somehow completely disregard Houndmaster in my post in the Houndmaster discussion thread, my bad. As for combining with her, I consider that fairly weak in that taunting her amounts to a board clear or removal spent that she'd probably achieve without Houndmaster. In addition, she doesn't really need the Attack, though the Health is nice."

hearthstone,3dylei,AlphaKlams,3,Tue Jul 21 04:58:49 2015 UTC,"Houndmaster certainly is what helps Midrange Hunter to be such an efficient deck. As far as tempo is concerned, getting a Webspinner or a Haunted Creeper to trade up while developing a board presence is a strong effect. The taunt it gives I find is usually not too key, but against weapon classes can be very effective in protecting minions (mainly the Houndmaster himself)."
hearthstone,3dylei,UltimaShadow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:26:52 2015 UTC,"That's exactly the way I see it. When I'm playing hunter, I'm not too concerned about throwing out taunters, but as a way to redirect weapons into meaty targets, it's perfect."

hearthstone,3dylei,SerQwaez,2,Mon Jul 20 18:06:56 2015 UTC,"One day its going to explode huge.  Warbot is highly underrated, weapon control is great for developing a mech board, and clunker value is nuts.  Siege engine is a really solid minion too.  Turns your defensive power into scaling offense.  I'm watching this next expansion very carefully because if its designed right a whole lot of fringe decks are going to become very viable... such as the other mech decks!"
hearthstone,3dylei,Jahkral,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:46:19 2015 UTC,"Its more a function of the classes.  Hunter has weapons plus a lot of removal and face damage, plus its hero power to finish things off once you get to a certain point.  Warrior lacks much of this.  Hunter's got equally efficient removal (Hunter's Mark vs. Execute), much more damage to go through taunts, a much stronger AoE in UTH, a much stronger removal option in Freezing Trap, as well as much stronger class cards.  Back to houndmaster, a 4/3 is much better stats wise than a 2/5, since a Hunter is about keeping control of the board, and if you need to remove a larger minion, the 4/3 is easier to trade up, plus with the taun factor it doesn't die that easily.  Or, if you want to go face, you just go face."
hearthstone,3dylei,Tarrot469,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:03:23 2015 UTC,I agree with the houndmaster/clunker body.  Probably the biggest problem with the card.
hearthstone,3dylei,Jahkral,0,Mon Jul 20 23:34:40 2015 UTC,"Warrior's hero power means warrior is never going to be able to run decks that don't want to draw the game out, otherwise you have a dead hero power and that's too much of a handicap to have before the game has even started. Its the reason face priest isn't a thing."
hearthstone,3dylei,theevilyouknow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:07:59 2015 UTC,"Naw, you just give them strong enough cards.  I've made it to rank 6-7 with pure face warrior multiple seasons since vanilla.

The reason is because (usually) when you play it in hunter, you're playing a more aggressive kind of deck, which makes the 4 attack from Houndmaster really good and it being a 2/5 not so good."
hearthstone,3dylei,HiperEg,2,Mon Jul 20 23:06:27 2015 UTC,Houndmaster is a strong card that only gets stronger with time. The more playable beasts the more consistent he gets. Even if the buff gets Silenced you're still very likely ahead.

hearthstone,3dylei,Aalnius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:00:19 2015 UTC,"Very good card if you get the buff off and only decent if you don't, but it's pretty easy to get the buff when playing Hunter. It's one reason why they can do the beast synergy very well. It's also one of the few four mana drops that fits well in Hunter, a class that had barely any good four drop before Shredder came about."

hearthstone,3dylei,BanditoPlays,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:46:13 2015 UTC,Cool Card. Should be more like it.Mid range hunter is still weaker but this is one of the cards that is pushing it towards being better than SMOrc hunter .

hearthstone,3dylei,highongrillcheese,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:34:15 2015 UTC,"Hunters avalanche when they are able to t4 houndmaster something. Compared to yeti, houndmaster only trades off 2 hp to give a minion mark of the wild. And the taunt is really good as well since it reduces the amount of ways to deal with the 4/3 houndmaster that just trucks face.   This card is a huge reason why you must kill the animal companion on t3 instead of challenging it with your own 3 drop."

If Hunter ever becomes viable in anything less aggressive than Midrange, this card will be the lifeblood of that deck.   All they really have to do is throw Hunter some decent beasts and the tempo hunter can take off. Houndmaster is already great but you usually don't see two copies in any deck."
hearthstone,3dylei,Anaract,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:31 2015 UTC,"I'm late to the party, but let's put this card is seriously amazing. Turn 4 hound master is a crushing tempo play that nearly always ends with you winning the game. As of right now, the card is monopolizing 4 card slots in most Midrange Hunters (webspinner would not be run without houndmaster)."
hearthstone,3dylei,Mezmorizor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:01 2015 UTC,"I don't play hunter much and if I do I try to play a slower game through board control and beasts because beast synergy is so fun. This is the only non-beast I run. I usually keep call pet in my opening hand and with stuff like tallstriders and snapjaws in the deck it's very satisfying to call pet into one of those and then houndmaster them early. Nobody expects a hunter to play an injured blademaster + circle heal + pw:shield on 4. Or a snapjaw + innervate + mark of the wild, with a free silenced shredder attached."
hearthstone,3dylei,Gdhshdg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:03:10 2015 UTC,How are hunters playing these combos? How is any of these examples compared to the houndmaster giving +2/2 and taunt to a beast?

hearthstone,3dylei,Jahkral,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:48:25 2015 UTC,"Great card, 6-5 + Taunt for 4 mana <3"
hearthstone,3dylei,yazkaron80,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:30:11 2015 UTC,"Arena:  Houndmaster is rated as a 62 on the Heartharena Tier List, which puts him in the ""Above Average"" category, but if you have any decent number of beasts (which most decent arena hunter decks do), then this card can be a lot better than just ""above average"".  As many have likely experienced with Kezan Mystic, playing a 4/3 for 4 mana with no upside feels really bad.  And sometimes we are forced to do this with Houndmaster.  The 4-slot is an important one in arena as 4-drop minions can usually soak up at least two small minions in the early game.  But with only 3 health, a naked Houndmaster is more likely to just die to a 2-drop.  However, when it does land on a Beast, the value is incredible.  Chillwind Yeti is considered by many to be a solid arena 4-drop as a vanilla 4/5.  When Houndmaster buffs a beast, he is an effective 6/5 for 4 mana where 2/2 of those stats have charge, AND you get added utility from the taunt effect.  If it is played on curve, Houndmaster can often turn an even trade into a 2-for-1 scenario.  Early swings like this can often create huge momentum, which is especially important for arena Hunter, as the hero power is much better with a good start.  Houndmaster is also good later in the game as it can make your small minions better.  Cards like River Crocolisk and Bloodfen Raptor are often disappointing draws on Turn 9 or 10, but if combo'd with a Houndmaster, suddenly they can contest your opponent's bigger minions and maybe survive a board clear.  I specifically want to highlight a couple of cards that Houndmaster is especially good to combo with.  Animal Companion on Turn 3 into Houndmaster on Turn 4 can be absolutely devastating.  A 6/4 huffer isn't quite as impressive, but having a 6/6 misha or 4/6 Leokk that early in the game can be a nightmare to deal with.  Houndmaster also works very nicely with Webspinner, turning it from an easily ping-able 1/1 into an Ironfur Grizzly with a deathrattle attached.  Lastly, Oasis Snapjaw, which is typically an underwhelming arena card, turns into a literal and figurative 4/9 beast of a taunt when hit with Houndmaster.  When drafting, you have to be a little bit careful with picking Houndmaster.  You want to make sure that you have adequate beasts to make it likely the buff will have a target.  I would usually want at least 4 beasts in my deck to feel like Houndmaster is worthwhile.  But of course, if you see him early enough, you can just pick him and actively pick beasts as you go.  Houndmaster is the type of card that can result in an explosive, game-winning turn, and this is a very valuable thing in arena.  If you've got the beasts and this guy pops up in your draft, don't be afraid to unleash the Hound...master.    Constructed:  Houndmaster is quite a strong card in Constructed for the same reasons as I listed above.  As someone stated in another post, when midrange hunter decks were first made popular by Lifecoach and his ""Sunshine Hunter"", people were running cards like River Crocolisk and Oasis Snapjaw, just so they would have early beast minions to drop Houndmaster on.  When Naxxramas came out, Hunters were given a huge gift in Haunted Creeper. This sticky, early game beast has the benefit of being both a great target for Houndmaster and a good card in its own right.  More recently, some people have been dropping one or both Houndmasters in their aggressive and midrange Hunter decks in favor of Piloted Shredder.  This is because the potential 6/5 in stats from Houndmaster is often matched or even exceeded in the combined stats of a Shredder and its 2-mana pilot.  The Piloted Shredder can also be more easily played as it doesn't require a beast on board to achieve its full effect.  That said, Houndmaster and Kill Command are the two most powerful Beast-synergistic cards, and as long as Hunter continues to be a powerful deck, we will continue seeing them on the ladder."

hearthstone,3dxkco,kazga,13,Tue Jul 21 04:28:49 2015 UTC,It's an 8/8. Giants are 8/8s. Most decks that run Alex are control decks that play very defensively and then use Alex to deal 15 damage.
hearthstone,3dxkco,_Apostate_,24,Mon Jul 20 15:04:03 2015 UTC,"My point was that you almost never play a Giant for 9 mana. So painting Alex as a ""Giant with Battlecry: Deal 15 damage"" is not really accurate."

hearthstone,3dxkco,hcriB,4,Mon Jul 20 16:36:31 2015 UTC,"Really depends on the decks being played and when you draw her. As a control warrior there are a lot of games where you can kind of sit back and armor up, killing all their stuff, and not touching your opponent until you can Alex them. As a freeze mage you really want to be able to use it on their face, too.   But with a more aggressive meta yeah she is definitely getting use both ways lately."

You have to know when there is a good opening to start getting in face damage, I describe it as shifting gears.

It's a very good if you say need to cycle to get a playable card. One may argue that in that case you're actually glad th erecruit is there so you can cycle.  Sometimes you have to go so far as to cylce on your own minion because you need to cycle so badly.
hearthstone,3dxkco,FacehuntersAnonymous,4,Mon Jul 20 22:37:58 2015 UTC,"It is a very rare situation that using wrath on a recruit to cycle would be better than actually having wrath in your hand. If you're in top deck wars, its good.  On turn 2, it's only a strong play if your hand is absolute crap. The likely hood they play a 3 or 4 health minion in the next few turns is really high, and you'll be wishing you had wrath then."

Not really, it's good to cycle wrath on a recruit instead of hero power it if statistically the card you are going to draw is better than wrath for your hsnd, which is not unlikely at all.  If you have no turn 3 play it's probably a goodidea to cycle wrath out. It's fairly unlikely your opponent on turn 3 is going to play something that can be wrathed if the turn 2 play was a recruit."

hearthstone,3dxkco,xpoizone,12,Mon Jul 20 23:00:39 2015 UTC,"It's cool, but honestly it's not worth it most of the time. I was the kind of player that was OK with spending $100 or so on a good deck, but if you aren't willing to spend at least like $300+ on a deck you'll get shit on. You can play casually too, but there are so many complicated rules and situations you can get into that even simple casual games get heated sometimes. This is assuming you play ""Standard"" magic, what I played, because that's what is usually supported. Standard magic stays balanced just because they ban all old cards, so every year or two you have to buy all new cards to keep playing.  Hearthstone pretty much instantly wins because the rules are in the game's programming, there's no arguing about how cards interact or waiting half an hour for an opponent to do a Patron Warrior style turn (and magic has no limit on how many minions you can have...). Magic has really cool cards and rules, but it has a lot of hassles, while Hearthstone's only real hassle is limited deck slots."
hearthstone,3dxkco,thegooblop,4,Tue Jul 21 14:34:05 2015 UTC,"That was informative, thank you."
hearthstone,3dxkco,CLevelIdiot,12,Tue Jul 21 05:52:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like making another post just to think through my thoughts, now that I'm thinking about it.  The gap between new and old players is huge too in MTG. 30 cards in a deck and a collection of free cards for HS, compared to 60 cards or more and no free cards at all. You can fill the deck with ""lands"", which are basically mana, but that's another problem. New players are stuck with basic lands, and players willing to pay can get special lands. The easy way to explain it to someone who knows HS but not MTG is like this: You get a very basic deck of whatever class you want, but your opponent can have a deck with 2+ classes, like Mage + Priest + Druid so they get the best of each. If your opponent paid for enough special land cards, they can do this with almost no downside.   It's worse than it seems because in an automatic simple game like Hearthstone the game plays itself, but MTG has REALLY complicated cards, and as a new player it really sucks when your opponent is playing expensive cards with effects you've never seen. You just have to nod and say ""ok, I'll take your word on that effect"" unless you want to call over a judge and have everyone wait while someone checks a rulebook on something silly like ""interactions with deathrattles when deathtouch and windfury minions hit something with divine shield"" (in HS terms, MTG is much more complicated and uses different words for similar effects). It sucks because sometimes the older players take advantage of the fact that newer players don't know the rules, I've seen small tournament games where a player would just bluff and get away with something because nobody wants to be the guy to call over a judge and call out the experienced player for something they don't know anything about. There were a few times where I (as someone who played 2 years or so) would sit next to a match that looked like a new player vs a 5+ year player, and had to say ""actually, the new player is right, you can't do that right now"" and the new player responds with ""oh, thanks, I was assuming they knew what they were doing with that strange card in their deck"".   Basically, MTG requires you actually learn all kinds of interactions and strange rules AND spend quite a bit of money or you won't get a very good experience. There is an ""arena"" sort of mode called Drafting that's better for players with small collections, but you still have to understand a lot of rules if you don't want to be one of the people calling busy judges around every couple minutes. MTG is fun with friends, but damn there are a lot of hassles in my local Friday Night Magic group, which had somewhere between 30-100 people a week last time I played."
hearthstone,3dxkco,thegooblop,4,Mon Jul 20 22:32:46 2015 UTC,"nobody wants to be the guy to call over a judge and call out the experienced player for something they don't know anything about   As a former high-level judge, you have no idea how much I hate this statement. We're there for you guys. The (tournament) rulebook has been designed with situations like this in mind, all judges try to do is restore equity and educate players in a pleasant manner. Call us.  As an aside, the worst clusterfucks in mtg judging occur when people let situations escalate by trying to be ""nice"" and not call a judge. It's very frustrating (especially to newer judges) to be thrown out of the rulebook because of an impossible situation that developed by not being called when it was possible to manage."
hearthstone,3dxkco,Antrax-,2,Mon Jul 20 23:40:22 2015 UTC,"The 2nd half of your comment is something I was thinking about. When I know a rule is different I call a judge, it's just that there are so many cards and situations where I would have no clue what an effect should do, and I just assume the other person knows what their cards do until they actually do something I know is wrong. That's why there are times where things get into impossible situations, I think a lot of the newer players just assume people know their own cards until they're sure something is wrong. At least in my group of friends it was never about being nice, but just that conversations went like this:  Player1: So, my card effect does this.  Player2(usually fairly new): I thought it did something else instead?  Player1: Are you sure? If you think I might be wrong we can call a judge.  Player2: I don't actually know, I've never used that effect. I thought I saw a friend use it once or something.  Player1: Well I've always used it this way.  Player2: I must be thinking of something else, sorry.  I definitely respect the judges at the place I went to, there were nights of Friday Night Magic where people were looking for a judge at 5+ tables at once while a few judges were trying to decipher some bizarre scenario that they've never seen. I don't blame the players either, when I played I tried to learn as much of the rules as I could, but even just learning all the cards in Standard was a challenge. I stopped playing as frequently right around the time people started arguing about enchantment creatures and when they count as what kind of card, I think MTG is just too complicated for people who don't want to read rulebooks, when a non-planeswalker has multiple unique effects I usually cringe trying to understand the rules for it."
hearthstone,3dxkco,thegooblop,2,Mon Jul 20 23:47:53 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see interpretation of rules being a headache, and I'm glad hearthstone resolves those for me.  I can imagine some of the more experienced magic players trying to bluff their way through a card combo, which would be frustrating to anyone at any experience level."
hearthstone,3dxkco,CLevelIdiot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:26:25 2015 UTC,"If someone is trying to bluff a combo the smart this to do is act really stupid and like you have no idea what it does forcing your opponent to go through it all without having all the pieces.   When it comes to rules, never have I experienced someone not follow the rules when playing against new players. Most of the time new players are welcomed with open arms and are usually allowed to take back misplays."
hearthstone,3dxkco,Loxamite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:31:31 2015 UTC,"The flip side is that, by knowing all the rules and interactions of the game, I know what happens when I cast my spells in magic. There are tons of nonintuitive results when doing stuff in hearthstone."
hearthstone,3dxkco,lasagnaman,2,Tue Jul 21 05:08:08 2015 UTC,"Magic vet here, I've played off and on for almost 20 years. It was my favorite game for almost that entire time. I picked up Hearthstone and haven't played magic since. After a year or so into Hearthstone I was able to admit that I like it better than Magic. It's easier to learn but you have many more options than magic in a lot of cases, making it deceptively simple."
hearthstone,3dxkco,2LittleBastards,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:47:09 2015 UTC,"You have alot more options in magic than you do hearthstone. Not really debatable. Magic allows stuff to happen on the opponents turn. counterspells, kill spells, or just any instant. Secrets are kinda that, but it limited quite heavily. Combat tricks, trying to get someone unblocked or not attacking because you have the mana up for a pump spell. Not to mention the card base is huge in comparison. Nothing against hearthstone, but it just isn't close to the complexity of magic, no Tcg/Ccg/Online card game is."
hearthstone,3dxkco,Tree60,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:05:54 2015 UTC,"Interactions in MTG are half the game to a Johnny/Spike like me. Hearthstone's lacking a bit of that at the moment, but it's completely free, which is THE huge plus."
hearthstone,3dxkco,Saritenite,2,Tue Jul 21 08:42:41 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the reason Hearthstone doesn't get too many interactions or really special effects is because things like that need to be coded. It's easy to do something like slap ""You control target player's next turn"" on an MTG card's text and let the players figure out how to play that out, but in Hearthstone it requires a lot of programming. That's before you even touch interactions, a single unique card could require special conditions against dozens or even hundreds of other cards, and the work piles up a lot faster over time because every card has to be tested against every past card.   I think simpler is better just because pretty much anyone could get into Hearthstone, it doesn't even need a rulebook because the game just does the correct things unless a bug pops up.  I think it's funny when people get mad that HS is ""pay to get ahead"", in MTG I paid more than I ever spent on Hearthstone just to get started with a collection far worse than anything you could slap together with just free cards in Hearthstone. The fact that majorly good cards like Fireball, Polymorph, Flamestrike, and Water Elemental come with Mage for free amazed me when I started Hearthstone. I fully expected for ""free"" players to get things like Arcane Explosion and have to slowly work their way up to getting anything used in competitive decks."

If I used ""rotate"" I'd probably get a reply asking what rotation was, and I'd just end up saying ""It's like banning all old cards from play so you have to use new ones"".

hearthstone,3dxkco,BokiBurek,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:35:42 2015 UTC,"400 dust is an epic. Epic is either a really good class card like Cabal or AoL and Tirion is also an amazing class card. It can also be something like BGH, which is a very inefficient trade-off. Tirion is one of the best legendaries in the game and not a single Epic is better than him imo.

hearthstone,3dz4wx,ogliver,19,Tue Jul 21 12:38:19 2015 UTC,Try to keep playing ranked so you get matched with equal opponents. Casual is way harder because experienced people go there to make quests.
hearthstone,3dz4wx,f_blue,9,Mon Jul 20 19:30:08 2015 UTC,My experience is the opposite...weird
hearthstone,3dz4wx,Vintage91,7,Mon Jul 20 19:54:13 2015 UTC,"Mine was the opposite at first, but lately when trying to run casual to attempt to learn Oil Rogue, I am getting matched against people with 4-6 of the top legendaries, including Dr. Boom, Ragnaros, Sylvana's, Grommash, Malygos, Ysera, Alexstraza, etc. I have only managed to get the adventure legendaries, and finally, finally crafted Dr. Boom.  But now when I go into ranked, it is generally more even, though it is a pain in the ass to try to rank up as a Druid against full decks."
hearthstone,3dz4wx,g3t0nmyl3v3l,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:04:04 2015 UTC,"I casual stomp if I'm trying to get my last bit of gold for a pack or arena run or something, I will rarely use my meta deck but more often than not I'm using a fun deck that I threw together. Those staple legendaries just fit mana gaps that I have but it's usually only boom and sylvanas that get in and sometimes loatheb. So if you see those cards don't immediately assume you're going to lose or think the opponents deck is better than you, I play a paladin secret deck that I love and has a boom and a sylvanas but it still looses 2/3 games."
hearthstone,3dz4wx,SausserTausser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:16:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I just goof off in casual for the same reason.  Got a 5 warrior win quest when I don't want to play warrior? I'll just make a shitty  aggro / face warrior deck and fuck around.  What always makes me groan is when you'll see stuff like, net decked freeze mage or patron warrior or handlock with all the legendaries and core cards, and they BM the hell out of their opponent.  Cool man. You're playing a meta deck in a casual game mode. Great job."
hearthstone,3dz4wx,r7chandra,2,Tue Jul 21 06:49:29 2015 UTC,"initially you'll be paired with other noobs in casual, but in a couple of days you'll reach an MMR in casual (yeah it has a hidden MMR system) where you'll be queued with just about anyone and realise that rank at rank 20-15 is far more enjoyable. Also try to get out of rank 20 quickly cause lots of people try to farm wins at this level to get golden potraits like the guy who beat you."
hearthstone,3dz4wx,Fen_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:40:33 2015 UTC,Casual pool uses a separate hidden MMR from the ranked ladder.  Other people claim the thing about quests just because they've played Casual enough to get out of the new players.
hearthstone,3dz4wx,drax117,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:24:18 2015 UTC,"Mine was too. I started out on casual, went like 14-4, switched to ranked, blazed to 17, and then since then I've probably been 10-70 the last couple days. Stuck at rank 20"
hearthstone,3dz4wx,Saritenite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:21:57 2015 UTC,Casual has a hidden MMR. During ranked your lowest rank is 20 and some people try to stay there as much as possible to farm wins for golden portraits. The ladder players who are equal skilled or equipped usually start around 17.
hearthstone,3dz4wx,Geniii,0,Tue Jul 21 13:53:42 2015 UTC,Rank 20 gets farmed by players and so does low MMR casual (casual has its own Match Making system Rating). You might get overrun in both. I got to rank 17 early in the season with f2p / basic decks. After that the decks and players I faced played to well to be tricked by my cheap deck.  Once you hit Rank 18+ you find strong (netdecked) decks with strong cards.

Many would advise against this, but I traded a tinkmaster on both EU and NA for brawl. Never regretted for a moment.  Still though, I'd give more thought to disenchanting cho because I like him. Tinkmaster has lost me more games than I have won."

hearthstone,3dz4wx,abovehi,16,Mon Jul 20 21:05:49 2015 UTC,"lol... welcome to Hearthstone.  Oh, and there's a reason the hunter is playing that deck down around rank 20.  He's just having fun.  A deck with all big legendaries will get trounced regularly, but the cards are fun to play."
hearthstone,3dz4wx,Vertixio,4,Mon Jul 20 21:02:55 2015 UTC,So much this I have a druid deck with 11 cards that aren't legendaries (including a couple of alarm-o-bots just in case) and it very rarely goes well but when it does it just makes my day.
hearthstone,3dz4wx,g3t0nmyl3v3l,5,Mon Jul 20 22:03:03 2015 UTC,Just about your edit: The person you have faced probably conceded to rank 20 to farm gold. Or just had bad decks with as many legendaries he can put in (which isn't very good)

hearthstone,3dz4wx,EmergencyTaco,4,Tue Jul 21 14:23:37 2015 UTC,"Just a couple of small tips:  -Legendary cards are tools. You can't just throw them into any deck and expect to win with them. You have to use them properly.  -Control hunter... doesn't. He's just having casual fun.  I'm glad to hear you're having fun; don't let the tryhards get to you. Constructed mode is full to the brim with them. If you keep with it and dedicate yourself, you'll be that one guy with a million legendaries some day, especially if you perform well in the arena."

hearthstone,3e3oow,AnthroGame,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:16 2015 UTC,"I love playing mill / fatigue decks for this reason. You really have to think out your turn and future turns if you want to win. As for their win rate, I've been getting decent wins with them up to when I stopped at rank 10 last month. I can post both my mill rouge and druid deck if you want.   Edit: Freeze mage is a deck that you may also enjoy. I haven't played it myself but from what Ive seen its a very skill heavy deck that works well at all ranks."
hearthstone,3e3oow,Toast1124,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:17 2015 UTC,I've liked the idea of freeze mage.  I tried it a little bit a long time ago and I sucked with it.  That was probably because I was really terrible then and didn't understand the game.  I also never really considered it to be terribly viable at all levels but you saying that makes me want to reassess that opinion.  Time to go look into it.
hearthstone,3e3oow,AlricPhoenix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:26 2015 UTC,"First, thank you for spelling ""Lose"" correctly.  So the goal behind any of the decks that win a lot are keeping out of range of combo and having good board clear.  May I suggest: Healing paladin? Almost impossible to take down."
hearthstone,3e3oow,gameresquire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:02:18 2015 UTC,"I play a ""big freeze"" echo mage you might enjoy. It is definitely competitive as I'm only a good-not-great player who plays every few days and I've played primarily this to rank 5 a few times. Another player, who turned me on to it, has taken it to legend. I think it has good matchups for ladder play because it beats patron warrior and most hunters, most of the time. The list is still a work in progress, but mostly there, and besides, the modifying the list is half the fun!  Anyway, decklist: http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/214281-brm-echo-updated-as-card-revealed  I hope you like it."
hearthstone,3e3okm,AlcyoNite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:28 2015 UTC,"With a respectable arena run, you should grab at least 100 gold and a Goblins packs. At around 6-7 wins I think you get at least your money back every time, or just about, so 150 gold+. Just keep doing arena run, and grabbing classic packs here and there. And do all the hidden quests for gold. Just google them, you will find a list."
hearthstone,3e3okm,FirstTime1992,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:51 2015 UTC,Buy classic packs.
hearthstone,3e3okm,Shaddow1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:02 2015 UTC,"Hey there. I understand as a new player, it's hard to get classic packs and you're right! This is currently a problem a decent amount of people are facing and blizzard should really fix it imo.   Either way, this really depends on a lot of different factors.   1) What's your avg win in arena? 7+ Wins avg is infinite sustain arena which could be important  2) Do you have all the important GvG cards? You want most of the mechs, dr boom, and maybe some specific class cards for certain decks you want to play in the future. I can help you out if you gimme any deck name.   3) Do you have any of the important classic cards?   If you get to the point where you have most of the important GvG cards, you should start funneling most of your gold into classic packs in my opinion. You should still run arenas (as long as you average above 3 wins per game) for packs and efficiency but extra gold you gain from maybe grinding ladder or doing daily quests can go into packs. If you don't average too high in arena, this could only translate to a pack every day or two but at least it's better than nothing!"

You want to be playing something unfair which can steal wins and push you over 50%.  Right now that deck is Patron Warrior.  Also, I'd consider a Demon Warlock with Bane of Doom and Implosion.  When those cards hit for max it's unfair.  Also, when your Voidcaller sneaks that Mal-gannis into play, that's also unfair.  So I'd say either Patron Warrior or Demon Warlock (with Bane of Doom)."

The amount of times I lost to instructor razuvious because he had multiple runeblades in his opening hand, and I would always mind vision the one card that wasn't runeblade..."
hearthstone,3e3f2p,99Ramproblems,2,Tue Jul 21 17:33:42 2015 UTC,"I would've gone Thaurissan. Your opponent would've most likely cleared a good chunk of his board to remove the Emperor, and you would've already gained the mana reduction.   By playing Sylvanas, all you had to gain was an Unshielded mini-bot, and your opponent was then free to play whatever he wanted.   It's hard to hold her sometimes, but Sylvanas is best to play when your opponent actually has valuable targets for her deathrattle.  This was not one of those times."

hearthstone,3e3f2p,Nielsjen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"I would have played Emp. It pretty much clears your opponent's board since he has to get rid of it while lowering the cost of a lot of your expensive stuff, especially Jaraxxus. Sylvanas doesn't do much here, at beast you get a 2/2 from it and that's only if he decides to trade into it, which probably isn't likely.  Finally, your next couple of turns look to be pretty awkward, so Emp at least makes those turns a little more manageable."

hearthstone,3dw40j,ConcedeDota,87,Mon Jul 20 08:02:41 2015 UTC,"Bon Jovi was the best.  On a serious note, I think the best way to one day down the road make old cards ""cooler"" is to simply provide them with card type classifications. For example mechs are considered ""mech"" but gnomes aren't considered ""gnome"", they are just minions.  If we take this Thrallmar farseer, aka ""swole gains mirin farseer"" and one day classified him as an ""orc"", it would open up older cards to newer deck usage.   On the flip side, this could make balancing a complete nightmare."
hearthstone,3dw40j,docwatsonphd,30,Mon Jul 20 03:57:10 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why certain cards were retconned with GvG, e.g. Harvest Golem gained the Mech type"
hearthstone,3dw40j,6Jarv9,19,Mon Jul 20 04:33:28 2015 UTC,Harvest Golems was one of the most used cards before GvG anyways.
hearthstone,3dw40j,Darkdrop,2,Mon Jul 20 05:37:13 2015 UTC,"ye but got replaced by better 3 drops tho, many classes have good 3 drops such as cult master or imp gang boss, and classes that does not have such a good card use spider tank in most mech decks, actually golem is pretty good in decks that need sticky minions like blooslust shaman or mech druid (savage roar).  just as shredder, if it would not just give THAT much value when you get something like millhouse, annoy-o-tron or other taunts / good cards it would just be palyed in sticky decks and spider tank in every other"
hearthstone,3dw40j,itonlygetsworse,3,Mon Jul 20 11:34:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly other than making the game better by improving the existing card pool, there is little actual incentive for Blizzard to do any of this.

hearthstone,3dw40j,ConcedeDota,19,Mon Jul 20 09:53:51 2015 UTC,that doesn't even happen now with dragons or demons for example. only decks that go seriously all in on a type are mech and to a lesser extent some beast decks.
hearthstone,3dw40j,enragedmanatee,2,Mon Jul 20 15:06:19 2015 UTC,"It does happen with demons, just to a slightly lesser extent. And it doesn't happen with dragons because dragon synergy was deliberately designed to not do that, it was an experiment by Blizzard that only met mixed success because while they successfully made a ""non-tribal tribe,"" it still wasn't nearly as powerful as mechs or demons proved to be and most of the dragon tribal cards don't see much / any play."

Also saying synergy is only with things like blastmage is a fucking TERRIBLY misleading thing to do. Synergy is when two things that aren't directly related to each other really work together. Like patron and warsong, frothing and whirlwind, patron warrior is a deck built around synergy. Synergy is when a card that is a real card without another card works better with another card, not a tribal card.,"

hearthstone,3dw40j,Arhys,7,Mon Jul 20 07:28:30 2015 UTC,"Aside from the attack I do not see why this comment is being DV'd. Synergy doesn't have to be between unrelated cards. It could be between Hero Power and a Card(Any damaging spell and Shaman's totems, any Enrage minion and Mage's fireblast..).  And what do you consider a ""real card""? Are the Ysera cards ""unreal""? Doombots? Spare parts?  How do you classify ""relatedness""? Are Stalag and Fuhgen unrelated?  Why would you say that ""tribal"" cards that work better together than separate do not constitute synergy? Does it stay true if they work well together but the nature of that bond isn't rooted in their ""tribe"" ?(Example Micro Machine and any mech with taunt)."
hearthstone,3dw40j,DPSisBad,8,Mon Jul 20 07:36:46 2015 UTC,"""Must not of had much experience with card game lingo""  I mean I only made a whole pojo forum post in yugioh back in 2008 regarding synergy in the goat format and moving forward, and have built EDH decks in magic only based around synergy with cards in the graveyard.

hearthstone,3dw40j,tegeusCromis,2,Mon Jul 20 11:08:50 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of how u/slayerx1779 expressed that opinion, but it seems basically right to me. You said ""Synergy is when two things that aren't directly related to each other really work together"", but really, it's when two things work better together than they do alone, period. Warsong and Patron have synergy, but so do Blastmage and any mech. The latter synergy is just more forced."

hearthstone,3e3bxn,Shadowofthedragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:22 2015 UTC,"Is there a reason why? As Zoolock I usually have board control so the opponent doesn't have many minions, Handlock I just created the deck yesterday and I have Tharussian and Loatheb in place of Sylvannas.   I've only been playing for a week, so any advice is appreciated. I just figured Ragnaros would be a better win condition."
hearthstone,3e3bxn,MyNameIsKiko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:56 2015 UTC,"Slyvanas can be used in a wider variety of decks more easily.   For zoolock it has great synergy with shadow flame and power over whelming. Slyvanas makes it much harder for an opponent to easily remove vs.  Rag whether they have a 0-7 minions on board.   Rag doesn't do as well with all of the death rattle and tokens now played. Susceptible to bgh. For handlock slyvanas helps keep you alive when they have to deal with it, and shadow flame.   Kind of niche, but abusive bgh you can kind of decide what minion slyvanas takes."
hearthstone,3e3bxn,Shadowofthedragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:58:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should've stated I don't use Ragnaros in my Zoolock deck.  The Ragnaros I crafted specifically for my Handlock deck and tempo Mage.   My Zoolock deck is basically a copy of Trump's current Zoolock deck.   Sylvannas death rattle is random, so why is it that she's considered such a high value card?   Sorry again, like I said I'm fairly new to the game and card games in general.  The only reason I have my current cards is cause I spent some money on packs and adventures to reduce the grind time."
hearthstone,3e3bxn,MyNameIsKiko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:21:36 2015 UTC,If your opponent doesn't deal with it immediately then you can make the death rattle go with the minion you want. Do they might trade a 3-5  then a 5-4 into slyvanas before playing a big card.

hearthstone,3dxu63,Greyfeld,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:13:10 2015 UTC,"A:  Peacekeeper is a 3/3 that neuters an opponents minion when it enters play.  I made a 7/6 into a 1/6, and added to my side of the board, I'd say that's worth more than a card.  Peacekeeper is unfair.  B: Blessing of Wisdom is a card, sure, but it costs 1 and it replaces itself immediately (AKA a cantrip).  Blessing becomes spectacular the moment it draws you that second card.  It's about as safe an investment you can make, when you guarantee the first draw and threaten a second.  C:  Playing Blessing of Wisdom on an opponents minion is often not a great idea.  When it happens, it's usually a desperate move; competent players will idle their blessed minion and wait for a high-value trade.  This case was different.  Venture Co. Mercenary needs to attack, otherwise the opponent will not be able to play minions.  Also, the mercenary will need to attack more than once, since 6 health isn't depleting with one swing.    As you can see, technically I did play three cards and targeted one minion with all of them.  Given the circumstances, though, I actually ended up 3+ cards ahead instead of two cards down, and that's not even counting 6+ mana worth of tempo gained from locking his Venture Co. Mercenary."
hearthstone,3dxu63,chickenmagic,41,Tue Jul 21 14:17:54 2015 UTC,"During Tavern Brawl I went up against a fel reaver, and didn't know it would not cause fatigue damage, so I started milling him rather than trying to win. Once he ran out of cards, I played my next card to find out Fel Reaver only burns cards and doesn't actually draw."
hearthstone,3dxu63,Shepherd57,16,Mon Jul 20 14:07:51 2015 UTC,"You're not alone :( I put a Fel Reaver in my deck for just this very case, as a counter to Sylvanas (I was seeing a ton of her in my meta at the time).

I was the reaver whisperer that day."

If they dont' have minions on the board for you to run into, there's not a lot you can do.

Against freeze mage, definitely gang up this) 0-1x Oil (I like to put one oil in but some control rogue decks don't) 1x Sabotage (great removal and good in weapon class matchups) 1x Big game hunter (you ARE a control deck. Theoretically, can gang up this against handlock but never tried it) 1x Preparation (one is enough, and is good with sprint) 1x Sprint (card draw, good with prep) 2x SI:7 Agent (I think some deck variants may use one or even zero, but if you have prep, backstab, poison, this isn't hard to combo) 1-2x Fan of Knives (I use 2, because so much spell damage but some decklists use one) 1x Dark Iron Skulker (Good against hunter/zoo, I used to run 2, but 1 seems enough) 2x Eviscerate (removal/finisher/great value card. 1 might be enough, but like SI:7 agent, it seems too good not to put two in)   There's a lot of room for teching and modifications. It is DEFINITELY a deck that can vary, especially based on the meta. You not only play counters for the first part of the game based on your enemy but on yourself. Knowing what cards you lack in your hand/deck is important when deciding to fan of knives on an empty board to get to that heal quicker or to sabotage this or that minion, etc. Your own card advantage is another opponent when using this deck.  Here is my decklist: (missing two backstabs) http://i.imgur.com/hdk7DpX.png  Haven't tried out spiteful but it seems a bit too slow.

Patron is a control deck first and foremost - you can't combo if you're dead.

Preferably strong minion-focused cards with good effects or overwhelming synergy with current cards. People say Priest is too reliant on combos, but I think the problem is just that its combos aren't strong enough. Zoo, Handlock, Patron, CW, and Druid all rely on some combos that are extremely powerful. Power Overwhelming + Void Terror, 0-cost Moltens with Shadowflame, charging Berserkers, Shield Block + Shield Slam, and The Combo are all either game finishers or huge tempo swings. Priest's best combo is Auchenai + Circle, and only really gains tempo if the opponent really over-extends."

hearthstone,3dyjs7,TwinkleTwinkleBaby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:56:23 2015 UTC,"But even if Priest played a little more like CW, I would be fine. Imagine if Holy Fire cost 2 less mana, overhealed (put you above 30 health if you're already up there) and drew a card? That's basically what Shield Block + Shield Slam is. I like the way the other guy put it, Priest just doesn't have any ""unfair"" combos like the other decks do. The most unfair thing is Shrinkmeister+Cabal on a Ysera, but even that takes 2 cards at 8 mana, and Ysera isn't even run often enough for that combo to be a game changer in enough games. You're usually just grabbing a Shredder or something."
hearthstone,3dyjs7,N0V0w3ls,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:05:18 2015 UTC,"Right. Shrink + cabal only works if they play ysera. If they don't play it, the cards sit dead in your hand. On the other hand, times when they do play it, you may not have the combo. That lopsidedness is the big weakness."

I'd rather if Priest go the aggro route, they go they way of Mech Mage and Zoo, with high value minions that fight for early control of the board, and then they could be healed in the midgame when you start running low on cards and high on mana.

Beast Hunter is currently not viable because the deck is too slow and has to tech in neutrals for heal/protection which ruins the beast synergy. Faster beast-centric decks are just worse than Midrange in every possible way.   Also for the love of god give Hunter card draw that works in slower decks.

It also doesn't abuse discard, which Blizzard doesn't want anyway.  Examples:  3 mana 1/3 Battlecry: Gain +2/+3 and Taunt if your opponent has no cards in hand costing 5 or more. (A stop to extreme aggression and a good card to play if your opponent is low on cards and is desperate to draw their finishers. 3 mana 1/3 is pretty awful baseline stats though)  1 mana spell: If both players have the same minion in their hands, summon both to the battlefield. (Interrupts combos while making for some extremely amusing games, if both players summon Ysera turn 1, for instance. Could also do nothing.)  4 mana 4/2: Battlecry: If your opponent has two of any card in hand, both copies cost 2 more. (Anti-combo tech. Makes some combos impossible without Thaurissan. If you predict incorrectly, it's a weak card to play alone.)  3 mana 2/4: Whenever your opponent gains a 4 mana card in their hand, draw a card. (Works with cost reduction as well, reducing Dragon's Breath from 5 to 4 by killing a minion draws you a card. Makes opponents want to kill the creature instead of ignoring it to draw cards or go face.)  3 mana 3/3 (3/4?): ALL cards cost their printed mana cost. (counters Giants, Thaurissan, Sorc. Apprentice, Mechwarper, Loatheb, Nerubar Weblord, Venture Co. Effect while it is in play, but also hinders your cost reduction. Early effects like these make for some more interesting games.)  3 mana 0/6: At the end of your turn, the player with more cards in their hand gains control of this minion. At the end of each turn, deal 3 damage to your hero. Deathrattle: Restore 6 health to your hero. (Makes for a kind of game where players try to use their cards faster to lose control of the minion. Indirectly counters Freeze Mage but can also backfire and be taunted or buffed with other minions.)"

It doesn't matter to casuals that cards or decks are overpowered. They are going to be mostly stuck in the lower level games anyways where those aren't as prevalent.
hearthstone,3dy7ij,Kaeoz,10,Mon Jul 20 17:45:07 2015 UTC,"rotations definitely could help new players in hearthstone, because there wouldn't be so much catching up to do. new players wouldn't have to unlock as much pve content or open packs from as many sets to play competitively. i just don't see what power creep has to do with that. and casual players who have been around for a while would probably be hurt the most by rotations, as the cards they've slowly amassed all eventually become literally unplayable, as opposed to the situation now, in which lots of cards are simply outclassed over time."

hearthstone,3dy7ij,Kaeoz,7,Mon Jul 20 18:25:46 2015 UTC,"i very clearly distinguished between new players and casual players. that was a pretty big part of my comment.  to me, casual means you don't play every day, try to reach legend or even rank 10 every month, or obsessively follow the meta. that doesn't preclude you from wanting to play fair games with good decks -- or from browsing this sub."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,byanyothernombre,-5,Mon Jul 20 19:51:20 2015 UTC,"Whatever you think casual means is irrelevant. What matters is that there exists a very large group of players that doesn't play competitively, may or may not play sparsely, and does not care for game analysis or following ""the meta"" or following ""the game's community"" at all. These players are casual players because they are NOT invested in the game's community or meta-discussions about the game. They just play because its a fun past time and will up and leave as soon as the game is no longer fun for them. This is Blizzard's market whether you like it or not and is what was implied at in the parent post when /u/praion said that casuals would be driven out.   This demographic doesn't care that Dr. Boom is the most OP card in the game or that Patron can do 60+ damage in one turn holy shit OP!!11!!!11! This demographic wants to log on, maybe play 1-2 games of tavern brawl. Go into constructed or arena and smash yetis together. You know what makes these players sad? That they don't get to use the cards THEY want to use, like imagine if Tirion was unavailable all of a sudden or bolvar.

Doubling values gives them twice as many numbers to work with and twice as many potential cards, as well as being able to refine the game by nerfing/buffing things without making them unplayable. With the current values you can't add or take away attack/health from most things without making it either OP or useless, doubling everything changes that."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,Shyt-Just-Got-Real,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:53:58 2015 UTC,"I think this would be bad, it would increase the difficulty of the math involved, make calculating lethal harder, etc. Lower cleaner numbers is good."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,_Apostate_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:31:54 2015 UTC,"they will run out of unique cards to create using the current range of numbers, so something like I described above has to happen if they want the game to keep growing. There's no way to keep the game balanced and keep adding 2 expansions & adventures a year without eventually increasing the range of stats to allow for more design space.   Even if they find another solution to that, if they keep adding more power creep like they did with GvG/BGM, 30 health isn't going to be enough so increasing player health to 40-50 is a certainty. Aggro/combo decks are simply too strong and consistent because its way easier to do 30 damage now than it was in vanilla HS."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,Shyt-Just-Got-Real,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:57:05 2015 UTC,"They can add new mechanics/abilities magic has A LOT of those.  If they improve their game framework they can get really creative with ongoing effects, or more sophisticated interactions.  Of course blizzard thinks that would be too confusing."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,unixtreme,0,Tue Jul 21 15:51:41 2015 UTC,"They could yeah, but their design philosophy is abysmal and they refuse to make Hearthstone as good and diverse as it could be."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,Sidian,2,Mon Jul 20 20:09:37 2015 UTC,"A post about power creep was the thing that made me have this consideration.  A rotating ranked format with Classic always being legal is an option, but I question how Adventure content would be handled?"
hearthstone,3dy7ij,hslimsch,-5,Mon Jul 20 15:30:13 2015 UTC,I don't think power creep has occurred yet for Hearthstone though. It's hard to find cards that are strictly better than other cards that are similar. Even Dr. Boom isn't strictly better than War Golem.
hearthstone,3dy7ij,tinydonkey,14,Mon Jul 20 15:39:20 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be funny here, in what situation is it more beneficial to have a war golem than a Dr boom?"

hearthstone,3dy7ij,DeliriousPrecarious,5,Mon Jul 20 18:59:56 2015 UTC,It's also worth pointing out that making Boom a 6/6 would likely be a buff to the card as it puts it outside of BGH range.
hearthstone,3dy7ij,hslimsch,12,Mon Jul 20 16:36:45 2015 UTC,"Mind Control Tech, a card that never saw play in constructed until Dr. Boom showed up."

hearthstone,3dy7ij,hslimsch,13,Mon Jul 20 16:01:35 2015 UTC,"It is very nitpicky, but then again so is the definition of something being ""strictly better"" which the definition of Power Creep from MTG operates under."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,tinydonkey,2,Mon Jul 20 16:07:42 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'll accept it, it's a fair point, I was legit curious, you had an admittedly fringe case, but you had one. Mischief managed."

hearthstone,3dy7ij,Calorik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:24:00 2015 UTC,That's why people still run golem over boom in decks Kappa.   You can contrive situations where some cards might be worse than others. That doesn't change the meta or what cards people run.
hearthstone,3dy7ij,hslimsch,6,Mon Jul 20 23:10:29 2015 UTC,"No, it has not yet, but it is something very hard to avoid in the long run."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,Deviant_redux,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:41:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can imagine that it would be hard to avoid in the long run. I think it is probably something that they are trying to avoid to some extent though.   It's a tough thing to balance. You want new cards to be strong and exciting so people will buy them, but at the same time they might be out of this world compared to older cards.   But for the time being, the card pool is somewhat small and we are all certainly craving more options."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,hslimsch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:47:20 2015 UTC,"Would you consider mechanical yeti a better card than regular yeti? its a mech which gives it better interactions than yeti, and if you play it in a deck that benefits from 1 cost spells you get move value out of the spare part than your opponent."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,JuniorXL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:43:42 2015 UTC,"Most Mech decks only run one Mechanical Yeti if any as it is rather slow and there is competition higher up the curve. So I'm going to look past the mech tag and look purely at the spare part mechanic.   I think giving your opponent a spare part is a liability, even if your deck is built around using them. Freezing coolant can be heart breaking, even time rewinder could make a Face Hunter happy.   I think where Mechanical Yeti was truly better was when Undertaker wasn't nerfed."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,iceman012,5,Mon Jul 20 18:48:33 2015 UTC,"Dr. Boom is strictly better than war golem in terms of deckbuilding, if dr boom did not exist you would simply just not use a 7 mana creature. Trogzor would most likely replace it."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,Houndoomsday,6,Mon Jul 20 18:11:46 2015 UTC,"Dr. Boom is strictly better than War Golem, because being strictly better in card games means being better in 95% of situations, not 100%.  You can always find situations in which one card is better than another; I could give a couple of situations in which a 2 mana War Golem would be worse than a 7 mana one (recombobulator and mind vision/thoughtsteal).  Essentially, strictly better boils down to: will you ever decide to run the strictly worse version in your deck?  Even in a meta full of hunters, in which Unleash and MCT are required 2-ofs, I'm pretty sure Dr. Boom would still be run over War Golem (if someone were thinking of running War Golem in a deck)."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,klod42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"I think it really is. Yeah, there are some times where it will be slightly worse, but those are rare and isolated situations. I mean you could argue that a 8/7 for 7 isn't strictly better than War Golem because what if it got mind controlled? I think that in a reasonable, neutral situation Dr. Boom IS strictly better than War Golem."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,iBeej,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:05:07 2015 UTC,"But he is. There really can't be such thing as ""100% strictly better"" in a game like this. You can find some downside to anything if you look hard enough. Dr. Boom is as strictly better than War Golem as he can possibly be in this game."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,phone101,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:08:54 2015 UTC,Even Dr. Boom isn't strictly better than War Golem.   I disagree with that assessment.  When you play Dr. Boom you are dropping a damage POTENTIAL of 17 for your next turn.  And that's just strictly speaking from a damage perspective.  There's no need to go in to all the other reasons why Boom > War Golem because everybody already knows Boom is a value card and War Golem is not.
hearthstone,3dy7ij,pwx,-2,Mon Jul 20 17:56:19 2015 UTC,There's also the potential that the 7/7 gets stolen by MCT.

hearthstone,3dy7ij,TBNecksnapper,2,Mon Jul 20 16:42:30 2015 UTC,"After a month, they'd get to use those cards again. Personally, I wouldn't be that upset since it is a pretty short time.  I love this idea too."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,adremeaux,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:54:12 2015 UTC,"Defensive abilities may also go up, better taunts, better heals, so done right they don't have to IMO. With the digital platform they also have advantage over magic that they can change cards when they see that things got out of hand and just give a refund, (rather than banning them and making them worthless, which isn't really feasible on a set still for sale.. the second hand market can't be very happy when their old but insanely good cards suddenly become worthless either!)"
hearthstone,3dy7ij,jrr6415sun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:07:19 2015 UTC,"The problem is, they haven't been planning for this. They've added practically no silence since classic, for example.

hearthstone,3dy7ij,adremeaux,3,Mon Jul 20 17:59:59 2015 UTC,"They don't want to add more silence, it makes the game less fun"
hearthstone,3dy7ij,HyperFrost,3,Mon Jul 20 20:03:59 2015 UTC,Yeah but they literally can't do limited formats if they don't.
hearthstone,3dy7ij,ExSavior,-5,Mon Jul 20 20:50:59 2015 UTC,Unnecessary. Yu-Gi-Oh doesn't have any format and Legendary is already a 'limited' card. And Blizzard doesn't need to have forbidden cards since Blizz can nerf cards if deemed too powerful anyways.
hearthstone,3dy7ij,bashtonroar,7,Mon Jul 20 17:48:53 2015 UTC,YuGiOh is also horribly broken due to not having any rotation/ protection against power creep. The top deck before the newest ban list was over 60% of the metagame. Only in yugioh is that considered 'healthy'.
hearthstone,3dy7ij,MrJillHace,13,Mon Jul 20 21:22:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of the focus in these comments are about card availability, and how it's more difficult to acquire old cards in MTG as compared to hearthstone.  While that is a consideration, it's not the only one.  Eternal formats exist in MTG to allow players to continue playing with their old cards when it would be unwise to let the new players play against them.  Devastating cards like Black Lotus and Ancestral Recall are going to decimate a new player showing up with weaker, newer cards.  Vintage exists to allow these players to play with their old, busted cards.  Imagine being able to play hearthstone with Undertaker Hunter, Miracle Rogue, and every other broken thing they've put into print so far.  This allows players who enjoy that sort of thing to experience it, without infringing on the playstyle of players who never want to see those broken cards.  Of course, this is where Hearthstone differs from MTG:  Eternal Balance.  You can't go back and change what cards say that have been printed in MTG (at one time you could, what a rules nightmare that was).  The only power they have is to Ban or Restrict cards (restricted being to only allow 1 copy per deck, as opposed to the usual 4).  That means any incredibly powerful card that slips through playtesting has its way with the game until the next banning announcement (see recently: Treasure Cruise).  Once these cards are banned, (and rightfully so) they can live on in eternal formats with a higher power level than those that could not bear them before.  Because Hearthstone can simply alter the text of each card, no broken card (as deemed by Blizzard, of course) can ever really live on in its natural state.  Would introducing new formats solve this problem?  Maybe.  Maybe you'd have to make a ""Play all cards as they were originally printed"" format.  Then that format will have to be balanced (via bans or restrictions) separately from normal Hearthstone.  Do I think this will happen?  No.  It's a lot of work to create a new format and convince players to get involved with it.  Not to mention, the card pool in hearthstone is so small that the variation between decks in each format is likely not to be very large.  I feel Magic got a really lucky start to be in the position that it is now.  We have lots of fun, absolutely broken cards to play with, yet the game remains healthy for over twenty years.  This is because developers back in the day had no idea what they were doing, and by some miracle the game survived.  Unfortunately, the HS devs have to be much more careful about what they print."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,Hoskit,17,Mon Jul 20 21:01:22 2015 UTC,With the speed they release new cards and how many cards they released...not in atleast 4 expansions.
hearthstone,3dy7ij,forgot_again,4,Mon Jul 20 14:44:49 2015 UTC,That's like next summer though.
hearthstone,3dy7ij,adremeaux,4,Mon Jul 20 18:23:21 2015 UTC,"When people say Expansions they generally mean something like GvG, they aren't counting the Adventures that add ~40 cards."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,abuttfarting,4,Tue Jul 21 00:05:35 2015 UTC,"They could test it out via Brawl. I wouldn't mind seeing a week with GVG only, or maybe everything-but-classic."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,adremeaux,8,Mon Jul 20 17:58:58 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind seeing a week with GVG only   Oof, my deck would basically be 'every GVG card I have' at that point"
hearthstone,3dy7ij,_tanstaafl,3,Mon Jul 20 20:19:59 2015 UTC,For the brawl it may make sense to have every card available for everyone to use.

hearthstone,3dy7ij,M8yMouse,4,Mon Jul 20 20:30:19 2015 UTC,"Well, eventually there will be an official Tournament Mode, and once they have that, they can set all kinds of parameters for different styles of tournaments.  Take a look at the tournament lobby of any online poker site and you will find dozens of different types of tournament -- different types of poker, different buy-ins, different blind structures, different turn time limits, and so on.  The parameters for Hearthstone tournaments will be different, of course, but as we have already seen with Tavern Brawl, Blizzard can set up a bunch of different types of rules, and I don't think they will have too much difficulty in coming up with a number of interesting competitive rule sets for the long term.  Remember, unlike us plebs, Blizzard can see at least a year into the future, and while there is always a chance something unexpected happens (like uncovering a fantastic new game mode via Tavern Brawl) they probably have a very good idea of how Hearthstone will evolve over the next couple of years.  They can also see the daily numbers, so if and when, say, Ranked mode begins to drop off in popularity, they will know it's time to do something about it. Of course, it won't happen quickly enough for those already complaining about it, but only Blizzard knows how representative those people are."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,IT_WAS_JUST_BANTER,3,Mon Jul 20 19:03:39 2015 UTC,"Eventually yes, but considering how little cards HS has atm, it's going to take years, pending how fast new cards/expansions are released."

hearthstone,3dy7ij,Uptopdownlowguy,2,Mon Jul 20 16:10:38 2015 UTC,"To be fair all cards right now are fairly easy to get. GvG did not had that much cards relevant for constructed. As long as the majority of cards in constructed decks come from the classic set it is easy to get. You just craft the singles from GvG and save gold to open classic packs to increase your collection. People who already have many classic cards play arena and collect GvG. If there comes a set in the future that heavily impacts constructed and all classes/decks suddenly need 5-10 cards from the new set we have a problem. Then you might need legendarys and epics from three different sets, plus cards from the two adventures. Even for people who pay it will be hard to get the cards needed."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,OriginalBuzz,8,Mon Jul 20 16:24:05 2015 UTC,This is something we'll want to address as we release more content. But we feel that we're still far away from that point. We're continuing to think about the best player experience for this.   How is that a yes?

hearthstone,3dy7ij,BChopper,4,Mon Jul 20 15:42:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think the primary purpose of having different formats is variety of playstyle though. It's so that it's easier to balance the current set of cards, since there aren't as many card interactions to consider, but only the active set.  It's also relatively easier to play, as you can generally know what to expect from your opponent if they have a limited set of cards to build a deck from."

hearthstone,3dy7ij,xorenadosuke,3,Mon Jul 20 18:15:44 2015 UTC,Pretty sure there will be reprints or alternatives for important tech cards.
hearthstone,3dy7ij,corgianoverlord,2,Mon Jul 20 15:03:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't foresee this ever happening. MTG most likely does this due to the fact that players do not have access to all those overpowered cards out there. The power 9 costs a ridiculous amount of money and there is no way for everyone to have them, or other cards from early set.   But with HS, no matter how far from now we get, everyone will have access to every card."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,stringfold,10,Mon Jul 20 16:14:00 2015 UTC,That's not really the reason for rotation. Rotation of standard is to keep the game accessible and keep competitive play from being too stagnant.   It also helps push product.
hearthstone,3dy7ij,OriginalBuzz,3,Mon Jul 20 15:20:47 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, can you just imagine the frustration when there are 5 different booster pack expansions available when you're a new player (and of course, arena only ever awards the most recent one)?"
hearthstone,3dy7ij,atree496,4,Mon Jul 20 15:46:37 2015 UTC,This is an important aspect to consider.  A restricted card pool can increase appeal to newer players because it is easier to get the core cards needed for a decent deck.
hearthstone,3dy7ij,YNOFREEUSERNAMES,2,Mon Jul 20 15:27:34 2015 UTC,"There has to be something they can do about this. Giving out a free pack voucher for wins, adding a tutorial to the store to help people figure out which pack they want to buy. etc."

hearthstone,3dy7ij,instareport,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:31:03 2015 UTC,"if they continue the current Tavern Brawl policy of having preconstructed / randomized decks every couple weeks, that's a very good start to keeping casual players interested. I played the heck out of this week's brawl with my FTP accounts because it was so much easier to complete the outstanding quests than with my very limited card collection in Ranked or Casual mode.  If and when they add a Tournament mode, I hope they allow differing rule sets, like ""basic cards only"", ""no legendaries"", and so on, so that new players can compete in tournaments on a level playing field."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,Pjfinega,2,Mon Jul 20 16:10:32 2015 UTC,"The limited access is not the only reason for adding formats. Collectible card games always need to get new players into the hobby or eventually the scene dries out. To achieve this you need to be attractive for the old players as well as easy accessible for new players. Imagine the top tier decks contain legends and epics from the classic set, and two or three expansions plus two or three adventures. There is no way you get those cards from opening packs or saving gold for adventures. So new players must craft most of their cards for decks and the grind would be incredible tough."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,BokiBurek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:09:44 2015 UTC,"You can only play power 9 in certain formats, and even then they are one per deck state. MtG has many more rules per format."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,arly803,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:34:06 2015 UTC,"The cost and rarity of old cards is not the reason why MTG is broken up into formats. The main reason is to fight stagnation. When the card pool gets large enough adding a few more in an expansion will do little to change the established decks unless you add major power creep. Without rotating formats people would be playing the same decks year after year which would soon cause people to get bored and quit.  Of couse Blizzard can chose to go with power creep, making all old cards useless in a few years. But without one of the two we will still be playing the same decks in five years which will be the death of this game."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,CKMo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:26:03 2015 UTC,"That's not it at all.  The reason not everyone plays vintage in magic isn't just because they can't get the cards, its because its NOT the most fun format.  Believe it or not, playing with the most powerful cards gone can be a lot more fun."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,-Npie,0,Mon Jul 20 16:52:49 2015 UTC,"""Back in the day"" when we all had the Power 9 it still wasn't any fun. The first person to draw Time Walk, Lotus, Mox Ruby, Fireball won."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,morgrath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:01:50 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's inevitable, if only for profit reasons (balance reasons are good too, so it's even more likely).  Without phasing out Blizzard has the danger of producing an under powered set, meaning all their work for the card set was essentially for very little pay off if everyone still says buy GvG packs to get Dr. Boom.  For the first underpowered set, it may be a little tough to determine a problem because a portion of the playerbase are still interested in collecting each card and trying out new decks.  But after the second or third release of an underpowered set (assuming no creation of formats) you'll see many people questioning Blizzards ability to create cards and balance the game which may cause people to leave and drive down popularity.  However, assuming ladder/ranked becomes a format where say, only the previous 3 expansions + core are playable, people interested in that have to be invested in every card set release because XYZ card and possibly the deck archetype are leaving."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,masanian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:05:19 2015 UTC,"I would like to, but Blizzard wants to make everything simple and formats are hard to implement in the game."

hearthstone,3dy7ij,OrangeNova,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:38:55 2015 UTC,"The moment they introduce rotations, if they ever do, is when I quit Hearthstone. I'd be so pissed that as a F2P player the colleciton I've spent so long grinding for just becoming useless only to have to restart that grind for new cards again that it would demotivate me too much to continue. I'm sure Blizzard have considered this, though, and since they're very against anything that would make returning players feel bad (Ben Brode has said he doesn't even like nerfing cards because it could be frustrating for returning players if they didn't realise their card had changed) I'd be surprised if they just straight up started massively limiting your collection. I'm all for a YGO style banlist on specific cards or rebalancing cards as to not limit design space, however, if neccessary."
hearthstone,3dy7ij,Godofallu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:54:36 2015 UTC,"The purpose of rotating formats is to be able to utilise an 'Escher's Staircase'. It allows them to rotate what is powerful each time the format changes, without actually have the game succumb to power creep over time. It's the approach Magic takes, and it seems to have been working pretty well for them."

hearthstone,3dy7ij,touchet29,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:21:58 2015 UTC,They'll either pull a Yugioh and introduce Banlists.  Or they'll adjust card strengths.
hearthstone,3dy7ij,lonepenguin95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:03:34 2015 UTC,I think they already have considering they just added Tavern Brawl.  Formats are just variations on the rules that add variety. Personally i'd really like to see a pauper mode that uses basics and commons only.
hearthstone,3dy7ij,Anaract,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:10:00 2015 UTC,"No, they will not. They have control over the cards for any nerfs that may be necessary (something most card games do not) and have made it clear they think there should be strictly better versions of cards existing"

hearthstone,3e2u0l,Suq_Madiq_Beech,3,Tue Jul 21 15:09:04 2015 UTC,Why are people downvoting this guy? Part of the reason Gallewix is not played is because giving the opponent a bunch of coins can kill you when they are trying to combo you.
hearthstone,3e2u0l,kthnxbai9,2,Tue Jul 21 17:08:31 2015 UTC,¯\(ツ)/¯
hearthstone,3e2u0l,Suq_Madiq_Beech,4,Tue Jul 21 17:40:34 2015 UTC,"I think he'd be incredibly powerful, hoenstly.  Maybe even too powerful.  Considering no creature at that point can trade straightup without a creature buff like Taskmaster, so any removal used on him goes to your hand.  He used to have 1 attack and that was deemed overpowered at the time.  I think if he had that one attack back now he'd be pretty good and usable."
hearthstone,3e2u0l,KingBubblie,2,Tue Jul 21 15:14:24 2015 UTC,You mean a neutral gallywix?
hearthstone,3e2u0l,Shaddow1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:10 2015 UTC,"I think it would be too powerful. Decks that attempt to steamroll you early on (mech mage, zoolock, shock-adin) would have an unfair advantage with a Cho played on curve."
hearthstone,3e2u0l,ToxicAdamm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:25 2015 UTC,So a neutral gallewix without the downside for 4 less mana? I don't see the problem here.
hearthstone,3e2tk8,Sromkie,4,Tue Jul 21 15:02:48 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of stuff to have on one minion. It could probably do without the ""Can't be targeted by spells or hero powers"" since the Deathrattle punishes them for killing it anyways, so the only way to go around it would be by silence. I'd make it a 4/6 with Taunt and that Deathrattle, and it would be good. 4 attack kills berserkers so even stronger Patron Counter."
hearthstone,3e2tk8,mylifemyworld17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:37 2015 UTC,"I went with the can't be targeted by spells or hero powers so that it couldn't be killed by a spell prior to dropping minions (to avoid the freeze). But, I guess even without that, they'd have to spend the mana to remove it, stalling by one turn (which is still something).   That would free up the stat point to give it that extra attack though, which is nice against Frothing Berserker."
hearthstone,3e2tk8,mylifemyworld17,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:43 2015 UTC,"Yep! That was the intention behind my suggestion. Giving it that effect gives the card no counter play outside of Silence, which a lot of decks aren't even running anymore. Removing it gives your opponent a chance to deal with it, but still have to do it right or risk freezing their board."
hearthstone,3e2tk8,mylifemyworld17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Makes sense. I think that's probably the way to go. Even without specifically targeting Patron warrior, I think it could be a fun card. The only thing I'd worry about is Freeze Mages getting their hands on it."
hearthstone,3e2tk8,mylifemyworld17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that could be an issue, but it wouldn't be that bad. It's just one more Freeze, and it's a Deathrattle, so they wouldn't really have the Freeze on command."
hearthstone,3e2tk8,mylifemyworld17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:24:36 2015 UTC,"I've made a second version (linked in original post), removing the spell-proof part and adding back the attack point originally removed for that effect. I agree; it feels more balanced this way."
hearthstone,3e2tk8,dirty_realist,0,Tue Jul 21 15:58:25 2015 UTC,"Much better, the only thing I'd change would be saying ""Deathrattle: Freeze all enemy minions."" to be more in line with how existing cards read."

hearthstone,3e2tk8,Suq_Madiq_Beech,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:43 2015 UTC,"It could definitely pass as epic, but then very few casual players would have it early on (and if this were real, I would want it to be more widely available). There are plenty of great rares and poor epics, so I went with how common I wanted it to be vs relative strength."
hearthstone,3e2tk8,Ke-Win,3,Tue Jul 21 17:50:02 2015 UTC,"As is, that should be a legendary, but it'd be awesome. If you took away the ""can't be targeted by spells,"" I think it's close to balanced. still strong, but almost balanced."
hearthstone,3e2tk8,AlricPhoenix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:01 2015 UTC,"True; most rare cards don't have that much text. I wanted it to be more accessible. If it's too strong, I agree that removing the spell targeting restriction may be the way to go to make it viable."
hearthstone,3e2tk8,Shaddow1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:27 2015 UTC,"It's plenty viable, it's just Epic or even Legendary in strength, especially while spell-proof. There's no need for the spell-proof part, because without it, it still costs the opponent one removal card, plus one complete turn practically. That's really strong."
hearthstone,3e2tk8,AlricPhoenix,3,Tue Jul 21 15:25:16 2015 UTC,"Another interesting approach to proactively stop such huge comboturns could be something like ""only one minion can be played each turn"" or ""minions can't have charge"". The second one would also be interesting as a facehunter answer though it feels like a hard card text to balance well."

hearthstone,3e2s0r,trojandonkey,2,Tue Jul 21 14:55:27 2015 UTC,"Also mech rogue is kinda weak. If you wanna go for mechs, I would suggest you look up mech shaman or mech mage. Feel free to ask me more, as I have played both extensively and both are relatively simple to play and cheap to make. You could probably make a functioning deck with the DE and the dust you have right now."
hearthstone,3e2s0r,trojandonkey,2,Tue Jul 21 14:56:45 2015 UTC,Forgot to mention i have this warlock zoo deck http://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/warlock-zoo-naxx-deck but i feel like i'm not playing it correctly...but i'm sure i wanna try another.I disenchanted the Greenskin and now i have 2500 dust but i still have some cards from others classes and i might get my dust up to 3000-3500 if i focus on one :D but not sure which.
hearthstone,3e2s0r,trojandonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:20 2015 UTC,"Well go with the warlock zoo deck for now. Aggro is good to learn the game, will face a lot of classes, and generally a good way to put in time at the beginning of hearthstone."
hearthstone,3e2s0r,amarriner,2,Tue Jul 21 16:19:48 2015 UTC,"I would definitely not disenchant Grommash. He's a great card. Greenskin is kind of a toss up. He can get you the Captain's Parrot, but you'd need all the other Classic (Golden) pirates to do that. Disenchanting him would allow you to instantly craft a legendary, or a bunch of epic/rares though. I'd probably DE him, but I'd say hold off for now since you're unsure.  As for decks, I find oil rogue to be a lot of fun, but you're right it's tough to play. Maybe go for a lower cost, and more straightforward deck until you get more comfortable with the game. Check out that thread by Sheng for some basic decks to see what classes you like."
hearthstone,3e2s0r,MunkyUK,2,Tue Jul 21 14:55:45 2015 UTC,There are gonna be new pirates in the expansion so Greenskin might become widely used soon.
hearthstone,3e2s0r,Nanobach,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:42:18 2015 UTC,I disagree with oil rogue being too hard to start out with. It is a hard deck to play but that also means you can improve. If you don't mind having some tough games initially where you make mistakes then I would say go for it. You will need a lot of thinking and reflection on what you did wrong but if you are up for this then I think it is a really good and somewhat cheap deck to play.

Now it sounds crazy to use my weekend that way, but there are still thousands of people that play in Magic PTQs every month.   Over time there is no reason that Hearthstone can't support longer tournaments. My guess is that it's not the best way to prioritize development resources today, but what if 30% of players surveyed prefer longer tournaments?"

hearthstone,3dyrot,deadbeard,16,Tue Jul 21 18:49:22 2015 UTC,I would like to see in game tournaments that are run in a similar manner to arena. So you could progress through the tournament and not have to wait for other players to finish before your next round and if you need a break you can take one.

hearthstone,3dyrot,deadbeard,15,Mon Jul 20 20:47:56 2015 UTC,"Instead of pairing you with the people who signed up at the same time as you, it could just pair you with someone who has the same win-lose rate. It wouldn't work like the standard tournaments we are used to seeing on twitch, but instead more like arena. The more wins you get the better the reward. Essentially arena with constructed decks."

hearthstone,3dyrot,touchet29,4,Tue Jul 21 04:49:34 2015 UTC,"That just sounds too much like ranked that you have to pay for with prizes.

Just seems much more exciting to me."
hearthstone,3dyrot,ExigentAction,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:55:21 2015 UTC,I second this proposal.   I'm might argue that it should be a best of 3 with 1 deck but that means a potentially long time commitment for a game like this.
hearthstone,3dyrot,Fikoblin,7,Mon Jul 20 21:52:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think any of this ""live tournaments"" will ever happen. It require spending a lot of time, waiting for others, it has problem how to manage signing up, etc. More possible way would be some kind arena variation, when you signup for small fee with your deck and play games. Prizes could be gold, packs, cards depending on how many of wins do you have. You can play it anytime, with or without breaks, don't have to depend on others. Simply - arena with constructed deck."
hearthstone,3dyrot,DesVoeux,6,Mon Jul 20 19:47:44 2015 UTC,"There are a number of legitimate criticisms about Magic Online, but most people agree one of the best features is that you can turn on your computer and in five minutes be playing in a Booster Draft tournament. This launched in 2002, so it's difficult to say that the technical issues (signups, pairing, etc) are a showstopper for players.   Magic Online has a fraction of the players that Hearthstone has, and still manages to have a healthy tournament environment.   Edit: To be clear, it's possible for tournaments to be an additional way to experience Hearthstone, without taking away from the existing options. It doesn't have to appeal to everyone to still be relevant."
hearthstone,3dyrot,deadbeard,22,Mon Jul 20 22:56:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe an unpopular opinion, but I don't get the appeal of an in-app tournament mode. How many Hearthstone players can and want to devote 3+ hours to a game? That basically locks out the mobile player base completely, and realistically the need to have a great constructed deck would lock out even more people. Plus you'd probably spend a lot of time sitting around just waiting for your next match.  Contrast the idea of tournament mode with, say, arena. In arena your personal collection is irrelevant, you're rewarded, and you can play your matches when you want. It's great for mobile, new players, and experienced players.  TL;DR: I don't think tournament mode will or even should happen."
hearthstone,3dyrot,DesVoeux,12,Mon Jul 20 18:21:22 2015 UTC,"I don't see any reason why they couldn't implement it in the same style as the arena mode. So you could play a few games, take a break for as long as you wanted and then continue."

hearthstone,3dyrot,NikiHerl,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:05 2015 UTC,"After you get the legend card back there is little incentive to play ranked (except of course going for top 100 legend each month for points, but that isn't realistic for most).

hearthstone,3dyrot,Werv,2,Tue Jul 21 14:53:04 2015 UTC,"Right, but I'd rather them just ""fix"" (I think most will agree that it needs fixing) ranked, instead of trying to alleviate the problem by introducing a new game mode."
hearthstone,3dyrot,NikiHerl,4,Tue Jul 21 15:04:23 2015 UTC,"How many Hearthstone players can and want to devote 3+ hours to a game?   And that is why I'm doing the survey. :)   We know over 30 million players have tried the game. What if 10% of those players want to pay for in-game tournaments? That's over three million potential tournament players.   You actually mention the experiences of ""mobile, new players, and experienced"" players, which illustrates how different kinds of players want different experiences. Tournaments is another kind of experience that some players clearly want, and hopefully the survey will give an idea of the level of desire. Ideally, Hearthstone would have different experiences that cater to all kinds of players, but there is always the real world limits of how to prioritize limited resources (developers, artists, game designers). Hearthstone is also a business, so Blizzard also has to balance keeping the game accessible with paying salaries and meeting the expectations of their stockholders.   The decision point should be ""How many players want this kind of experience, and does it justify the allocation of resources?"""

hearthstone,3dyrot,DesVoeux,5,Tue Jul 21 15:14:52 2015 UTC,"That's the same reason I never got into WoW Raiding. I can't devote 3+ continuous hours to any game. That's just me, people seem to really want a tournament mode so more power to them, if Blizzard conjures a way to do tournaments without a long time-commitment I'd be interested (and impressed)."
hearthstone,3dyrot,ThePabstistChurch,2,Mon Jul 20 18:30:28 2015 UTC,I guess what you need to realize is that tournaments already happen all the time.  So obviously there is a large base of people willing to make the time commitment. If it was integrated into the game that number would obviously go up.  Personally I could see myself doing like one a month.
hearthstone,3dyrot,OpDruid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:10:16 2015 UTC,"I am aware there are tons of tournaments, and I enjoy watching them, but they are organized outside of the app. An in-app tournament has very different problems."

hearthstone,3dyrot,Braddo4417,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:28 2015 UTC,"So because some people might not use a feature it shouldn't be implemented at all? I think most competitive players play on their computers, so without the mobile players a tournament mode would still be pretty popular tbh."
hearthstone,3dyrot,NevyTheChemist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:08:18 2015 UTC,"For better or worse, it's very unlikely that Blizzard will implement something that doesn't work on mobile. That's the platform they've always had in mind when designing Hearthstone, and it's a huge % of their revenue stream & player base. Again, look at Arena... that does a lot of what people are asking of a hypothetical tournament mode, but was obviously designed to appeal to all users."
hearthstone,3dyrot,notpopularopinion2,9,Tue Jul 21 13:29:27 2015 UTC,"As someone who plays primarily on my phone on my lunch break at work, I probably wouldn't play very many tournaments that required a 2-3 hour time commitment. I think having 8/16/32/64 person single elimination formats would be pretty cool, with scaling buy-ins and rewards."
hearthstone,3dyrot,AterCruor,3,Mon Jul 20 17:54:21 2015 UTC,Maybe they'll use the warcraft 3 tournament system? You play some games as qualifiers then finals against the ones who did best.
hearthstone,3dyrot,Jeronimo1,4,Mon Jul 20 18:18:37 2015 UTC,"I would like to see in game tournament that are casual and hardcore gamer friendly so basically the same as arena but for constructed : you enter the tournament with a constructed deck and play till you either get 12 wins or 3 loses and get rewards based on your performance with a 150g entry fee.   With such a in game tournament mode everyone is happy : casual player can play tournament without having to comit 3h+ straight and can play a tournament game per day, hardcore gamer can actually gain good rewards for being good at constructed and blizzard will obviously make money out of this like they do with arena.   Also bonus point i think is it would be extremly easy to implemente since its arena for constructed."
hearthstone,3dyrot,AgTown05,4,Mon Jul 20 19:19:22 2015 UTC,This question    Assume Blizzard only has resources to add support for ONE of the two live tournament options discussed earlier. Which option would you prefer they did first?   Should have option(s) similar to   Other tournament structure  Neither (do not want resources dedicated to tournaments)   I personally would like a tournament structure but do not like either of the options that have been provided. If you do decide to take this data further this one question may provide inaccurate opinions as it is an ultimatum type question.

hearthstone,3dyrot,NikiHerl,5,Mon Jul 20 17:44:52 2015 UTC,"I plan on doing data analysis on these results beyond just the standard pie charts, and specifically looking at questions like:   1) How does attitudes toward tournaments change based on player experience (length of time playing)? 2) How do attitudes toward tournaments changes based on how much a player has spent?    I predict that players on the higher end of those two scales are the ones most interested in tournaments, but it will be interesting to see if the data matches that prediction."

hearthstone,3dyrot,HammerbroHS,5,Tue Jul 21 16:59:16 2015 UTC,"I kinda wish you went into more detail on the actual format and accessibility of the tournaments.  I think the most important part of an in-game tournament is to let people run private ones, where they can choose the tournament format (Elimination, Swiss, etc.), match mode (Conquest vs. LHS vs. others, BO3/5/7, etc.), and other important features of a tournament.  This would give tournament organizers a much easier job, and there would be no chance of cheating or accidentally messing something up during the matches."

hearthstone,3dyrot,NikiHerl,2,Mon Jul 20 21:33:54 2015 UTC,"You forgot the very important detail of how many players are in a tournament. If it's 463587354 players i won't have a good chance of winning or even placing top 25%, but if it is 8 or 16 players i'd have a good shot at winning."
hearthstone,3dyrot,MeteorPunch,2,Mon Jul 20 20:56:45 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. In a two hour tournament, assuming the matches last roughly 15 minutes each, there would be 256 players. That's only in a 2 hour tournament..."
hearthstone,3dyrot,TP-3,2,Mon Jul 20 21:38:27 2015 UTC,"8-10 hours? In holiday season I can do that, but on regular weeks that is absolutely impossible. 2-3 hours is doable. But I'd rather do two arena runs then. Also. If you invest 150/1000 gold in a tournament, I'd assume you would get some reward for just competing. Else it would highly discourage low-average skilled players from competing. If only the top 20% gets any reward you just ruin the experience for newbies.  Youd essentially get a tournament mode where everyone has to be extremely skilled. Or waste money/gold."

For example, I did buy both Adventures with real money, I just did it as soon as they came out, which was more than 2 months ago (a common scenario, I imagine). Also, I'm pretty sure most participants will choose ""1-4 times a month"" for both tournaments, I think it would have been wise to differentiate a little more (for me it would be 3-4 for the first type and maybe 1 for the second)  Edit: I feel like I should say that it's still very cool of you to have done it and that I'm quite interested in the results =)"
hearthstone,3dyrot,matth1,2,Tue Jul 21 15:11:55 2015 UTC,"A previous survey from March used the ""in the past two months"" time frame, and I wanted to be able to compare these results with the older ones. I did expect that the number of respondents who purchased an adventure in the last two months to be low for the same reason you did, but it turned out we were both wrong -  over 70% of the first 1600 responses say they had paid real money for an adventure in the last 60 days.

They're $25 apiece and they give you solid cards that will allow you to compete immediately on ladder.       2) If you're picking up on the game quickly, doing arenas is a great way to improve your collection if you can consistently get 5+ wins. 4 Wins breaks even on the 150g buy in, you'll get additional packs, dust, etc to craft those necessary legendaries.       3) Every few weeks/months, Amazon has sales for Hearthstone packs. Reynad has a tutorial on how to get sub-$1 per HS pack when they have their deals. https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/2uy44u/psa_amazon_promo_is_back_30_more_packs_for_the/      Everyone else will have their own tips and tricks but I would recommend to keep one thing in mind while playing this game: HAVE FUN.

hearthstone,3e2pda,ThunfischGott,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:09 2015 UTC,There are no meta relevant counter spells so blue does not exist. There are not enough direct damage spells so burn does not exist. There is only one good tribal deck the mech deck. Its a very cheap and strong aggressive-midrange deck. There is another simple rush deck taking burns spot the face hunter. Fast decks in general are strong in hearthstone because of the different blocking mechanics and no counterspells hooe that helps a bit.
hearthstone,3e2pda,Protteus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:54 2015 UTC,"Sounds obvious but the biggest thing I noticed while watching a friend in a similar position to yours is keep in mind your opponent chooses who to attack, you don't chose who to defend with.  It really does require a different mindset because it is never safe in this game to drop a minion that is important but weak (such as armorsmith) while your side is empty because it will just go to waste.  Otherwise like some people said Trump's basic teachings is very helpful to get you in the right mindset for this game.  Some things that work very well in magic are a terrible idea in this game."

It will help you the most in terms of learning the decks and the mechanics.  Also, don't over value high attack minions. Since summoning sickness carried over, and since your creatures can be targeted by enemy creatures, it makes dudes with weak bodies much weaker. It gives opponents the choice to trade up and gain a lot of value.   A big mistake I would make consistently in the beginning was forgetting about hero power. Don't do that. Haha  Gl hf."

hearthstone,3dzh28,AoRaJohnJohn,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:46:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but they might slot it in before the art is done, and instead of using the same Uther artwork they might use this since it already exists."
hearthstone,3dzh28,hoorahforsnakes,2,Mon Jul 20 21:57:44 2015 UTC,"But i'm saying what would be the point? New heros i imagine wouldn't require too much testing, and basically the whole thing is the artwork itself. Testing with some random placeholder seems pointless"
hearthstone,3dzh28,Heroman3003,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:06 2015 UTC,Entering animations. Hero power animation. Yep. Also they could add these without artwork and use existing art as placeholder.
hearthstone,3dzh28,Uptopdownlowguy,0,Mon Jul 20 22:16:48 2015 UTC,i believe hearthstone uses unity. using a placeholder is literally just dragging a jpg to the unity interface
hearthstone,3dzh28,ItsZant,11,Tue Jul 21 00:49:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah this has been mentioned in the original post as one of the reasons it might be fake, seeing as the art is old. When new skins got entirely new art made for Hearthstone spesifically."
hearthstone,3dzh28,pewpitar,8,Mon Jul 20 20:52:14 2015 UTC,"i agree, only thing would hold true if this was real, is that it is just a placeholder image, while they await the artist to finish up the hero's new art"
hearthstone,3dzh28,devilsfork,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:04:19 2015 UTC,But then....why wouldn't they just use Uther?
hearthstone,3dzh28,M1M1R,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:46:39 2015 UTC,for internal testing to make sure theres no bugs with using a new paladin skin.  all they'd need to do is replace the file once the art is done
hearthstone,3dzh28,czhihong,11,Tue Jul 21 07:52:24 2015 UTC,"Hmm maybe this is not relevant at all, but all new heroes come with a card back, and there is already a ""Maraad"" card back."
hearthstone,3dzh28,Kaiser499,2,Mon Jul 20 23:01:34 2015 UTC,"This is kind of relevant. Paladins as a class are relatively well represented in the lore, so it's possible that Blizzard would avoid Maraad so they don't have to rename an existing cardback.  ...possible, but not likely. I can't imagine it would be too difficult to rename it to ""Vindicator"" or ""Exarch"" or something else Draenei-esque.  Still, good catch."
hearthstone,3dzh28,MetalShake,3,Tue Jul 21 04:00:30 2015 UTC,"One of the main selling points of the new Heroes' skins is that they feature new art.   These new Hearthstone Heroes will feature beautifully detailed animated Hero portraits, including all-new art never before seen in the Blizzard universe. The first new Hero we’re introducing is a famed Warrior—the mighty King of Ironforge himself, Magni Bronzebeard!   They won't reuse art for the new skins, if Maraad is indeed the new paladin hero. It's possible that this is just an internal build that features random placeholder skin that didn't make the cut or something though."
hearthstone,3dzh28,jetlags,4,Tue Jul 21 01:37:58 2015 UTC,Yrel would be my pick for the new Paladin hero.
hearthstone,3dzh28,ace1217,4,Mon Jul 20 20:13:39 2015 UTC,I want Dezco but there are quite a few good paladin's to choose from. Maruad would be a solid choice.
hearthstone,3dzh28,jetlags,3,Mon Jul 20 23:02:45 2015 UTC,"It won't be a horde paladin because they aren't going to change the minions produced by the hero power. They haven't changed the icon for any of the other new heroes, so they won't do it now. It would not make any sense for a horde paladin to be summoning Silver Hand Recruits."
hearthstone,3dzh28,M1M1R,4,Tue Jul 21 02:40:19 2015 UTC,"Maraad and Yrel don't have much to do with the Silver Hand either, though."
hearthstone,3dzh28,MetalShake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:32:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but at least they're alliance. It's less egregiously lore-breaking than a horde paladin summoning alliance paladins."
hearthstone,3dzh28,DispencerW,4,Tue Jul 21 03:35:49 2015 UTC,"They also didn't change Animal Companion for Alleria, despite the fact that Leokk, Huffer, and Misha are Rexxar's animal companions in the lore.  ...and Thrall already summons a Draenei searing totem, and has since vanilla.  I wouldn't be surprised if we got Liadrin or Dezco, and the hero power still summoned Silver Hand Recruits. Lore in Hearthstone is pretty secondary."
hearthstone,3dzh28,hobbitluck,4,Tue Jul 21 04:03:03 2015 UTC,Makes about as much sense as Magni summoning a bunch of horde warriors.

I can't think of any notable human paladins who aren't male and Alliance (with maybe an exception for Prince Arthas), so I think it's fair to say that it'll be at least a new race.  I don't think it'll be Draenei, however, since we already have an Alliance paladin.   My money's on Lady Liadrin.  She's a different race, sex, and faction than Uther.  She's also the leader of the Blood Knights, the only Horde paladins for (most of) Warcraft's existence,  so she's certainly well-qualified to be a hero."

Stalling out the game, having card draw, playing moltens, echoing those and so forth to then killing the opponent because he can't kill you because of ice block and he can't kill all giants if you have 4 or more (due to echo of medivh which gives you a copy of every friendly minion on the board)"
hearthstone,3e2kpx,vooffle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:08:46 2015 UTC,Grinder mage as a name is also used for Control/Majordomo by many people. They are more similar to CW though. Surviving early game and huge chunks of legendaries or big creatures
hearthstone,3e2kpx,Suq_Madiq_Beech,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:28 2015 UTC,"Just as a note, there are a lot of different types of grinder mage. Echo Moltens is a really popular one at the moment, but there also is Majordomo Mage, an OTK Duplicate Mage with Antonidas, Dragon Grinder Mage and so on. Basically every Mage deck that attempts to win in the late game that isn't Freeze Mage is a Grinder Mage.  There also is a Mill/Fatigue Mage that aims to win after the opponent has exhausted their entire deck and is taking fatigue damage. I don't think it's all that playable after BRM, although it completely wrecks any Mage that runs Mirror Entity."

hearthstone,3dywat,noitarenoxe,14,Tue Jul 21 00:43:53 2015 UTC,"Okay, serious time is now. I main Midrange Druid and I currently run Harrison, one Ooze and Blingtron. Against non-weapon classes, it's useful for any extra damage at all on your own side, and since I then have two other cards that can get rid of the opponent's weapon, it really doesn't do much for them at all - I only play Blingtron when I know I can immediately play one of the others, however. Turn 6/7 Blingtron into Ooze is probably one of my favourite turns ever when I get to use it.  Against weapon classes, it gets rid of their current weapon, that's pretty much it. Just an extra anti-weapon card. As a presence on the board, it's not great, but against combo classes - Warrior and Rogue in this case - a 3/4 still isn't that awful. It still trades pretty well against common combo minions - Warsongs, Farseers, it can trade against a Shredder and you can then mop up with your own weapon.  Plus, closing out a game with the Force/Roar combo backed up by a weapon's damage actually happens a lot more often than people would think.  Fun card, probably my favourite in the game. I have a soft spot for silly, non-obvious cards like that."

hearthstone,3dywat,Mylifemess,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:27:24 2015 UTC,What different cards do you use?
hearthstone,3dywat,Sinkers91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:18:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, it's mostly poorman options :)  Loot hoarder -> bloodmage Scarlet crusader -> Edwin (it's not trying to find replace for him, just another sticky minion)  It's hard deck to play, sometimes I am wishing for healbot.  But ATM if I am playing rogue I usually using gimmicky but good Mukla/Pirates/Blingtron deck :)"
hearthstone,3dywat,Mylifemess,10,Tue Jul 21 01:29:53 2015 UTC,"I've seen some decks run it with Harrison, since they are both 5 mana its actually a really strong 1 turn combo (2 minions + card draw + random weapon)   Problem is it doesn't do anything to affect the board and blingtron doesn't have much utility otherwise."
hearthstone,3dywat,cephster,15,Mon Jul 20 17:44:01 2015 UTC,"That's not entirely true, since you can use the weapon."
hearthstone,3dywat,TimedforPress,4,Mon Jul 20 19:00:33 2015 UTC,That's true you can attack right away and potentially clear something.
hearthstone,3dywat,cephster,9,Mon Jul 20 19:19:23 2015 UTC,"It does affect the board, just randomly. Who knows, you might get that Gladiator Longbow and be able to clear that pesky Baron Geddon.  Or you can get Light's Justice and wonder why you thought this was a good idea."
hearthstone,3dywat,jivex5k,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:01:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like Light's Justice gets a bad rap.  Yes, it's the worst weapon, but it deals 1 damage for 4 turns.  It's like a Fire Blast that costs HP instead of mana.  Total counter to Silverhands, and still useful against anything that still has that little bit remaining.  Trump ran this in Arena on his last 12-2 run.  It was surprising how effective it was."
hearthstone,3dywat,blue_2501,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:08:41 2015 UTC,I don't know. 4 damage to the opposing face over the course of 4 turns seems good to me.
hearthstone,3dywat,Tsukuruya,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:54:50 2015 UTC,Well any other weapon would be better
hearthstone,3dywat,noitarenoxe,3,Tue Jul 21 00:45:25 2015 UTC,At high levels Blingtron is run in mech and tempo mage with a lot of freeze like two chuggas + two water elementals. allowing for a mage to get a weapon destroy an opponents weapon AND prevent them from using it. Now that is value.
hearthstone,3dywat,thesignalliveson,2,Mon Jul 20 19:04:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't use term tech card, but more of a niche card. You can make it work, but it will require more resources.  Tech is more of a counter card, in which blingtron is not."
hearthstone,3dywat,Werv,2,Tue Jul 21 00:01:05 2015 UTC,"Valid tech card when used in any class that does not contain a weapon of its own. It can be used with Harrison, but it is an expensive 10 mana combo. You need to be able to use this card in the right situation to make it worth it, by giving you the win with it or replacing an existing weapon with a new weapon. It is a card that can screw the game for you by giving you light's justice and the opponent gorehowl, etc."
hearthstone,3dywat,xViralx,2,Mon Jul 20 17:44:30 2015 UTC,"I've heard a of combo with Warlock's Floating Watcher. The damage you receive from attacking buffs it. Though, FW are really prone to silence like many other cards"
hearthstone,3dywat,ThatGuyWhoAintYou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:07:26 2015 UTC,You could play funky Savagery druid deck with Blingtron. 1 mana deal 7 dmg with Gorehowl? Pure valueKappa

hearthstone,3dywat,HS_Dane,2,Mon Jul 20 23:02:31 2015 UTC,"Well it fills a similar role as Harrison Jones, the main purpose being to destroy your opponent's weapon. The downsides are that you don't draw any cards and that you give your opponent a new weapon, which can potentially be even better. The upside is that you also get a weapon. However, it is also weaker in stats than Harrison (-2/0). I would say that if it has potential, it would be in handlock since the card draw from Jones can actually be a downside for handlock. In addition, your weapon gives you the potential to clear minions while also moving into molten range. However, ooze might just be better because of its mana cost. Ooze allows you to play it AND a belcher or drake that turn, whereas Blingtron would probably take up your whole turn. I play a lot of handlock (got 500 warlock wins last night!) and would love to experiment with it. Sadly, I do not own Blingtron and I don't believe he is worth crafting, especially with the potential expansion coming out :("
hearthstone,3dywat,RushSt182,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:35:48 2015 UTC,"Reynad won a tournament back in the days with Blingtron Mech Mage. I think your analysis on it being a tech card is somewhat on point, the only deck I've seen it in contribute effectively was a weird savagery roleplay druid list."
hearthstone,3dywat,vooffle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:49:04 2015 UTC,"It's borderline valid. There are some interesting combos you can mek with it, you can use it to destroy your opponent's weapon and it acts as a source of direct damage for any class."
hearthstone,3dywat,ApexHawke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:49:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think Blingtron can be a disruptive little fucker. I'd consider running him as a tech card against an eager Patron Warrior, who wants to hold onto his Death's Bite deathrattle. Of course there's always the delicious Blingtron-Harrison combo in hopes of eating the enemy's Doomhammer.  I for one would welcome a Blingtron-heavy meta. It'd stirr things up.   Though I can't really say anything about Blingtron in actual gameplay, since I don't have the card."
hearthstone,3dywat,OnlyRoke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:06:38 2015 UTC,Had a priest play Blingtron once. Gave me Gorehowl. Then he combod a Harrison.  If you don't want to gamble too much a combo like that may be viable I guess?
hearthstone,3dywat,mofothehobo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:30:36 2015 UTC,I think its decent with ooze on turn 7
hearthstone,3dywat,MessiasIsBack,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:02 2015 UTC,"It's good if you can freeze the opponent with Chugga and/or Water Elemental, as you basically get a free weapon. I remember a mech mage deck running it. It's also really fun :)"

hearthstone,3dywat,Pucmeloud,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:28:29 2015 UTC,Blingtron in a synergy lock deck would work very well imo. I've never got to try him out though.

hearthstone,3dywat,MechaSixVII,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:13:24 2015 UTC,Reynads mech Mage is awesome. I like subbing out a clockwork or cogmaster for an acidic ooze or Harrison jones but it's not required if you can keep your opponent frozen with the chuggas or water elementals. Bling is mostly used as a finisher though.  Deck list: https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/decks/reynads-blingtron-mech-mage  Good article on Reynads mech mage: http://www.dailydot.com/esports/blingtron-mage-reynad/
hearthstone,3dywat,wtfchuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:16:48 2015 UTC,"In isolation it's a fairly inconsistent card that has the risk of giving you a severe disadvantage. However, there are decks that can control the variables enough to make the card worth it. In Mech Mage with snowchugger/water ellies/frost bolt/ice lance you can lock your opponent down, greatly mitigating the risk while gaining added face damage and benefiting from mech synergy.   It's tempting to try in oil rogue but I think the deck is better when it's very consistent, even though the Bling occasionally wins you games. 5 mana is a lot of mana to spend on a random weapon in a lot of scenarios in the deck."
hearthstone,3dywat,_Apostate_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:23:15 2015 UTC,This post combined with the game I played earlier is making me try Blingtron in control priest. Wish me luck!
hearthstone,3dywat,xCablex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:30:59 2015 UTC,its an invalid tech card.
hearthstone,3dywat,Snics,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:37:19 2015 UTC,"I've added blingatron to one of my decks, it has won me 2 games vs patron (Screwed up his combo).    Against non weapon classes, only use it when you need to push for damage or think he cannot take board control with a weapon.    Against weapon classes, just overwrite their weapon, if they get a better one you cry, otherwise you laugh at them losing their bow/deathsbite/etc."
hearthstone,3dywat,limitedaccount,2,Tue Jul 21 03:48:27 2015 UTC,Blingtron is only legitimately valid in two archetypes that I can think of: Mech Mage and Aggro Priest (the Shadowbomber type).

hearthstone,3dxmay,stoffelhase,13,Mon Jul 20 12:01:14 2015 UTC,Is it even a misplay if it can't possibly under any circumstances effect the outcome of the game?  I can't think of any card in the entire game the Hunter could draw the next turn that would make you wish you had a 3/2 healbot on board.
hearthstone,3dxmay,_dirkgently,2,Mon Jul 20 12:22:27 2015 UTC,"true. This wouldnt have happened if the game wasnt already over. But this was my chance to discuss a strifecro play, how could i miss this chance :D"

hearthstone,3dxmay,ninjamies23,3,Mon Jul 20 15:02:12 2015 UTC,"That sort of works.  It does mean the Hunter gets another turn, but I'm not sure if it gives him any chance to win.  Drawing Belcher resolves the next turn with the hunter having absolutely no board and 8 health vs a 5/2 sylvanas, 4/2 drake, 8/8 giant and 14 health jaraxxus for the handlock, which is now out of range of even the quickshot miracle combo."
hearthstone,3dxmay,_dirkgently,-12,Mon Jul 20 15:12:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's still a misplay and a pretty big one. In this situation it didn't matter, because the game was going his way anyway. But making bad trades like that is the reason a lot of the games are lost.  I'm watching StrifeCro's stream a lot and I can say that he makes such ""mistakes"" sometimes when he's in a great spot. When he's in a bad situation, he tries much harder. But in case like that, he's like ""oh, well, it doesn't matter anyway""."
hearthstone,3dxmay,stonekeep,2,Mon Jul 20 12:46:14 2015 UTC,It isn`t a big missplay if you have basically won already.
hearthstone,3dxmay,ninjamies23,2,Mon Jul 20 14:21:15 2015 UTC,"No missplay, only extended BM."
hearthstone,3dxmay,Xplayer,-3,Mon Jul 20 14:23:07 2015 UTC,"Explain your reasoning, because I disagree.  Misplay is a misplay, the fact that it didn't have an impact on that game doesn't make it any lesser. Let's say Hunter forgetting to use the Hero Power even though he had mana is a misplay - even if the 2 damage didn't matter in the end, it's still a misplay.  /r/hearthstone with their downvoting for no reason strikes again."
hearthstone,3dxmay,stonekeep,2,Mon Jul 20 14:42:47 2015 UTC,"If there is absolutely NO WAY of it mattering, it isn`t a misplay. Making it in a different situation where it does matter is a misplay. Whether it is or not depends on the situation.    Misplay is a misplay, the fact that it didn't have an impact on that game doesn't make it any lesser.   Misplay means it has a negative impact on your game, so it has to impact something. If it has no impact it cant be a misplay. In a different situation the same play might be a misplay, in a situation where it doesnt impact anything it isnt."

Making it in a different situation where it does matter is a misplay. Whether it is or not depends on the situation.   Oh yeah, if your play has absolutely no way of mattering, that's true, you can't call that misplay. It's called BM then. But just apply what you've just said to that situation. Hunter COULD possibly come back into the game with some card combos and there is a chance that the 3/2 minion would matter in the end. We don't know whether the Hunter didn't run, I don't know, BGH to kill the Molten Giant (I'm not making it up, I've actually seen a slower Midrange Hunter deck in Legend running BGH) and then do some other stuff to stall the game.  So, by your definition, that was a misplay and yet you argue that it wasn't."
hearthstone,3dxmay,stonekeep,0,Mon Jul 20 23:31:45 2015 UTC,"So it's okay to play sub-optimally if it doesn't affect the overall outcome of the game?  Playing flawlessly is impossible all the time, but I wouldn't say it doesn't matter if you make a mistake if you still win, haha."
hearthstone,3dxmay,MahvelBaby,4,Mon Jul 20 15:06:32 2015 UTC,"I also thought so, but thinking about it, it was probably intentional to give his opponent one less hound if he had unleash the hounds."

hearthstone,3dyzuc,ShadowRaven6,3,Tue Jul 21 01:50:56 2015 UTC,"Assuming a one turn proc of Emperor, a Mage can play out the following for 10 mana:  Malygos (8) Frostbolt (1)- 8 damage, 8 damage total Frostbolt (1)- 8 damage, 16 damage total Ice Lance (0)- 9 damage, 25 damage total Ice Lance (0)- 9 damage, 34 damage total  I've been playing that deck for a while, and it's as bullshit as Patron. Yet no one complains about it. Face it, Combo decks are always going to be around in Hearthstone. Instead of nerfing the decks, it's probably better to just add cards that counter it- ie playing Loatheb on the turn you expect a Freeze Mage to try to OTK you will basically win the game."
hearthstone,3dyzuc,FinalGuardian,23,Mon Jul 20 18:45:23 2015 UTC,"The difference between this deck and patron is patron has a lot more win conditions than just malygos.  Before patron there was math warrior, which used mainly warsong and frothing zerk, trying to make the zerk insanely huge then swinging hard. It was really gimmicky since you normally needed both zerks and a warsong in order to win. Now they get grim patron and zerk as win conditions and suddenly your win conditions almost doubled."

hearthstone,3dyzuc,Imoa,0,Tue Jul 21 01:17:27 2015 UTC,"I would argue the control and midrange deck points, being able to drop a midgame emperor is a great play for control and midrange if they find the room.   You're right about the aggro decks though."
hearthstone,3dyzuc,ShadowRaven6,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:24:44 2015 UTC,"Freeze Mage has more than one as well. There's Malygos + Frostbolt + Ice Lance x2 (most common, occasionally 2x Frostbolt), or the more traditional Alexstrasza + burn spells. Some decks also run Antonidas in addition to Alex and Maly, which adds another potential win condition. I'd say that's at least on par with Patron with just pure patron combos or frothing combos."
hearthstone,3dyzuc,FinalGuardian,3,Mon Jul 20 20:27:22 2015 UTC,"Those last 2 aren't OTK's though, which is the biggest problem of Patron Warrior and Miracle Rogue. With Antonidas you know what's going on in his hand, he plays it, you know there's now 6 dmg in his hand. With Alex, they can do it to you sure, but there's a chance of healing, finding some way to counterplay the next turn where he bursts you down."
hearthstone,3dyzuc,ShadowRaven6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:51:45 2015 UTC,"You're right that it's not a OTK, but it is another win condition. Playing pure patrons without a frothing can often result in a win (ie vs Druid, Warrior), but often isn't a OTK."
hearthstone,3dyzuc,Massacrul,4,Mon Jul 20 21:02:46 2015 UTC,"It's not even close to patron consistency, that's why noone complains about it. Simple freeze mage is more consistend, malygos version is better in rare cases.  Patron deck has way more triggers, is dangerous even without thaurissan, and does not only rely on patrons but also has frothing berserkers."
hearthstone,3dyzuc,Shabam999,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:49:53 2015 UTC,"Well think about how likely it is that patron gets its combo versus this deck. What does patron need? Warsong + patron + possibly 1 activator(deathbite, whirlwind, etc.). None of these cards are legendary so you can have two of them in each deck which greatly improves consistency. There are also a lot of other ways it can win, usually through frothing, again increasing consistency. Plus using bits of your combo to defend of yourself don't stop you from pulling it off later in the game.  This deck on the other requires two legendaries in hand + both copies of multiple spells to have its one turn kill. Also, if you use one of the parts of it earlier to try to survive you won't be able to pull off the full combo. This makes the deck a lot less consistent than patron. Plus there are some extreme direct counters to this deck. If you really want to destory it, play some face hunter with flare or kezean and possibly even a loatheb. Or maybe control warrior with double shield block and shield maiden. Easy 80%+ win rate. Patron has no such counters. It's worst matchup is like 35-40%."

Definitely don't craft commons or rares unless you really miss one or two of those from the deck you are trying to build (and you already have the rest of the cards). When you open your 100th pack, you will start regretting any dus tyou spent on rares and commons. On the other hand, ther is a pretty good chance that you will not get the desired epic or legendary even from your 1000th pack, so keep your dust for those, as those are a safer bet. Only dust excess cards. Only dust golden, if you have two common already (or not even then). 50 dust seems to be a lot now, but it isn't. Depends. There are a lot of fun cards in GvG, but most of the decks still contains about 50% classick cards. I'd say until you get about 80% of all the possible playable rares from classic packs, those are better options, and maybe even after that, simply because that set has more useful legendaries and epics. GvG packs have a lot of fun cards, but if you don't have the basics to back them, you can't play them really."

If you don't have many good cards, he should be in every deck of yours. Before you dust anything, you need to know what you are going to craft with your dust. I recommend you saving for now. Play 2 weeks without crafting anything because you are guaranteed a rare per pack. The only 2 legendaries I recommend absolutely to craft is Sylvanas, and then Dr. Boom. These 2 cards can fit in 75% of your decks minus aggressive decks.  And Yes, Classic packs are way better than GvG. Just get gvg packs from Arena. Learn how to play well in Arena and it will be profitable."

hearthstone,3dzovt,ApexHawke,2,Mon Jul 20 21:38:04 2015 UTC,"I would disagree with what seems to be the prevalent opinion here. I think you should disenchant all your golden cards and at least one unique one. I don't know how many of these commenters are F2P, but I know how frustrating it can be to lack a good collection. Most of the cards on your list are pretty good, but at the very least, you should dust Kidnapper. It's garbage and it's always going to be garbage.  That being said, you should not just craft staple rares. As someone else has said, figure out the deck you want to play and try to save up to get the cards you need for that deck. For Oil Rogue, for example, Preparation is a must. In Patron Warrior, epics like Brawl and Shield Slam are often nice to have. In Face Hunter, you'll need a few rares like Arcane Golem and Eaglehorn Bow.  This strategy will allow you to build competitive decks sooner, which will in turn allow you to get the dust and gold you need to build more competitive decks."

New players need time to memorize typical class decks and the different versions out there to fully understand the cards and then decide what they want and need. Anyways my 2cents"
hearthstone,3dzovt,tsugar93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:56:01 2015 UTC,"Early on, focus on just keeping cards and building up your collection. Find cards that are only slightly below average and use them. With a limited collection instead of focusing on synergy and full netdecks, just try to build a deck with a proper curve and necessary removal/AOE's. Kinda like how an arena deck looks.  I highly recommend crafting cards that can form the base of any deck, especially for the mana slots you always use, such as Knife Juggler, Azure Drake, Piloted Shredders. While these are just rares/commons, the probability you open a specific one is so low it'll be more fun to get them immediately."

I'm mainly grinding the daily quests and play arena and tavern brawl when I have extra time.  All I can say about crafting right now is ... don't. You'll end up regretting that decision no matter what, because you just don't understand the game well enough to know what cards you'll need. You haven't even played all classes yet. (You should, grinding them all to level 10 gives another 100 gold...)  Keep playing, keep buying packs. Once you hit 20-30 packs, you'll start getting third copies of cards, that's when you'll start piling up dust. Once that figure hits 400, think about crafting an epic you don't have yet.  Unfortunately, the game is very infriendly to F2P players. With a few exceptions, top competitive ladder decks will require several wings of Naxx and BRM and cost somewhere between 1000 and 10000 dust. Grinding that all out is possible but you're better off spending money at some point, even if it's just to buy Naxx."

I think you should spend your gold on the first wing of Black Rock Mountain since it gives you Thaurissan which is absolutely amazing in slower decks.  Sunwalker is a decent card especially if you play a Priest deck around Revive , another card you will unlock if you get Thaurissan first. When it comes down to disenchanting , try to get 1 copy of Cabal Shadow Priest , it will get you far with Priest and you will still be happy if you pull out a second copy.  I would also recommend you to play Shaman , but Mechshaman needs a whole different card set up than Priest and a ton GvG cards.  So if you want to try Mechshaman go for GvG.  If you want to play Priest and slower decks in general go for Thaurissan in BRM."

If you ever need the card, then you can always craft the regular non-golden version and have dust to spare.  Good staples worth crafting:   2x Piloted shredder (Common) - Arguably the best 4 mana minion in the game.  2x Azure Drake (Rare) (Mainly used in Mage/Rogue, but still good in other decks) 2x Knife Juggler (Rare) (ONLY if you play Hunter, Warlock or Paladin)   Maybe it's not worth crafting the rares, because you might get them from packs. But if you have dust to spare, these would probably be the first ones to craft.  General expansion staples:   Sludge Belcher (Curse of Naxxramas, 2nd Wing) Loatheb (Curse of Naxxramas, 2nd Wing) Mad Scientist (Mage, Hunter) (Curse of Naxxramas, 4th Wing) Emperor Thaurissan (Blackrock Mountain, 1st wing)   And yes, keep opening classic packs. There are only a handful of GvG cards worth getting and you can craft them easily later with the dust you get from the classic packs.

It's a golden + it's not a good card which means you likely won't miss it anytime soon...and by the time you did, if you did, you would have a base one by then.    That's a good first legend to get.  It's mostly a tech card, but its a useable card in a lot of decks you could make.  It's not getting dr. Boom, but my first legend was completely useless, that's not the case here."
hearthstone,3e2eiw,DrunkenBard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:55:01 2015 UTC,"Adding shredders gives a lot of board presence, maybe trade for assassinate since you're looking to counter patron and hunters those don't have many good assassination targets."

Also, a brewmaster or two would be mandatory to make the most of your Oracles when you don't have Shadowstep.   I also go with two Shiv's to get the cards I want faster.  Final suggestion: Add an explosive sheep to your deck to deal with low-HP minions (and those Mage taunts) :)"

You will need those cards eventually.  Just going off you having 0 legendaries doesn't help to give an idea of how your sets look.  You could be hoarding goldens or just really unlucky with legendaries.  I don't know if I would recommend the 40 packs at once, but buying some would probably help.  Whether they are new cards or old cards--does it matter?  Maybe only spend 15 now and save 25 for an adventure if it is a one-or-the-other situation just in case (adventure cards are significantly higher value generally than packs)."

If you are heavily focused on another class/deck and you really need a legendary to complete it then it's worth considering, but I still wouldn't.  I don't know everyone's opinion on the card, but for me, I think it's the best class legendary in the game."

hearthstone,3e2dxf,Shaddow1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:14 2015 UTC,anytime. You can swap out something else (I usually drop an acolyte) for a second brawl if you see a bunch of midrange decks like patron
hearthstone,3e2dxf,Shaddow1,0,Tue Jul 21 13:15:18 2015 UTC,Swap Acolyte or Shield Block? I really don't know. Acolyte can give you at least two cards though.

With your list, i see the ysera really out of place for climbing unless you are facing a lot of slow control. You really want impact cards to turn the game when you have kinda stabilized and is starting to swing the game.   I run this list atm. http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/269001-control-warrior-is-back-full-guide   Not really anything special, except for the tech-inclusions and changes to more fit a aggro/climbing meta. This list switches ofcause, but it is also very ""standard"".  As for crafting. In the current meta i find the Harrison really good for dealing with Patron Warrior (to disrupt their combo), hunter and rogue (but really, you can easely win without). The Baron eats BGH after you've dropped your boom. Also really good against zoo and aggro pala."

Tentatively, remove two spells for Zombie chows (I'd take the lightning bolts) and two vitality totems for a harvest golem and an Antique healbot.  Since you're playing reincarnate, Piloted shredders could be a better option than Fireguard destroyers (And with 4 mechs, you could try a powermace instead of a feral spirits, maybe) And you definitely want to replace a Cairne with a Sludge Belcher, because you just can't run all of the 6 drops.

hearthstone,3dzv4l,RCcolaSoda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:52:15 2015 UTC,the concept is basically either a worse shield slam for board control or another face tool for combo druid.  i don't like either idea.

hearthstone,3e047x,GDQuirm,8,Mon Jul 20 22:49:13 2015 UTC,"Whether or not you turn out to be correct, that's a great essay."
hearthstone,3e047x,DesVoeux,2,Mon Jul 20 23:26:42 2015 UTC,"That indeed is a great essay. Let me express some thoughts about that.   First, I've seen many people write about 'power creep' in a very negative way. Not implying you do, because you clearly don't, and I also don't think, that the possible new card (if it is real) represents some sort of power creep, but I will still note, that some sort of 'power creep' happened in many tcg's before and that I feel like it has to happen as long as we want this game to provide us with new stuff over a long perios of time. There is only so many cards you can create without becoming repetitive, and with the addition of new cards, it becomes very likely, that one day there will be a card, that is just better than other cards of the same cost have been before. I, for once, want new cards, that I can play around with. That - of course - also implies new effects, but for that to happen, cards will be created, that will be stronger, than other cards we've had before. That might not be a splendid thing for players who chose not to pay for the game nor to play it as much as you need to obtain all cards on a f2p basis, but it might be hard for the game to not become boring if it doesn't exist.  On the actual point of this thread: I will note, that I agree with /u/wzrdmn on whether or not certain decktypes die out. Yes, the game has been shifting severely into a more tempo-oriented position, but the addition of a new add-on, or several new add-ons, for that matter, will always change the game a lot. One additional set could add a lot of very efficient removal-spells and minions, that want to be dealt with in the early game by said removal spells, which might give agressive decks a hard time. They might add certain preemptive counter-cards, that might make it hard for combodecks to finish the opponent off. Those things can easily happen, and only because a game has been shifting in a certain direction, that doesn't favor a certain playstyle, that doesn't mean, that a new add-on might change things drastically.  I, however, still agree with you in the case, that the addition of said 'leaked' card implies, that decks, that rely on tempo, might be favoured, but that does not necessarily apply to the rest of the cards, that may be added in that new expansion. I wouldn't declare control dead yet, mainly for the reason, that the meta always shifts and new decks or changes to existing decks have always been found by the player base. It's not unlikely for a control-based deck to counter the other decks drastically enough for it to become the new meta.  /edit: I am also not sure if that new card, if it is real, would even be played in the current metagame without the addition of other, different cards, because it doesn't affect the board much, and, albeit it being hard to remove, does lose to many of the currently played decks (specifically: aggro-hunter, aggro-paladin, patronwarrior), in a way, that they'd just ignore it."
hearthstone,3e047x,Kharaaz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:24:09 2015 UTC,"The larger point was not actually the new card, but rather the types of cards Blizzard has consistently promoted. It's technically possible that a new expansion might come about with a lot of good removal.  I find this highly unlikely. We've made it through three card releases, and only two spells have been added that are consistently used as hard removal in control: Dark Bomb and Lightbomb, since Quickshot is best with an empty hand, and Flamecanon is best when ahead on the board.  That's two solid removal spells that are actually efficient in a control deck in 184 cards. And all of them fail to trade 1 for 1 against minions that cost the same or less mana to play, on top of the tempo deficit taken from doing so. Lightbomb is universally known as the only playable card that trades Boom 1 for 1, but even that still results in 2-8 damage leftover, putting you at a deficit for playing removal almost specifically designed to deal with the situation, on top of being put at a huge tempo deficit from spending your turn playing removal.  So while I think it's definitely possible Blizzard could release an expansion geared towards efficient removal, I would be very, very surprised to see it happen, because of the view they take towards interactivity.  I DON'T think that Blizzard wants to promote people going face either; those decks are still fairly uninteractive as far as the board, hence why similarly, they haven't added any strong instant damage, or any good chargers in any of those three releases either, other than Quick Shot. But I DO think they want to promote decks in the style of Zoo or Midrange Paladin, since those have a lot of minion-heavy trading, and that falls in line with their perspective on board interaction over hand or deck interaction."
hearthstone,3e047x,wzrdmn,4,Tue Jul 21 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"Take a step back for a sec dude. This is 1 card that may or may not be real and you're saying control decks are dead in Hearthstone. Heck, before BRM combo decks didn't really even exist in Hearthstone. I think it's a bit premature to say control decks are dead in Hearthstone when we're probably going to see over 100 new cards released soon. A single card in BRM - Thaurissan - was a giant boon to combo decks. I'm sure in 100+ cards there will be a bone or two thrown to control decks. And if there isn't, well Hearthstone's pretty young. I'm sure we'll see expansions to come that readjust and realign the meta in ways that support control decks."
hearthstone,3e047x,djaeke,4,Mon Jul 20 23:33:06 2015 UTC,It wasn't really a statement about the one leaked card. I was saying the card is representative of a general ideology behind card design that blizzard has.

Past expansions all I saw was the growth of aggro, tempo, and midrange more than control. Control warrior sat at the top of the rankings from the beginning of Hearthstone and Blizzard made other decks stronger to rival its power, bringing the ""rock-paper-scissors"" philosophy."
hearthstone,3e047x,KenniHS,2,Mon Jul 20 23:59:39 2015 UTC,"Slow cards are different from slow decks. Slow decks run a lot of instant cards that impact the board immediately. Slow cards are better when playing from ahead, because although they don't impact the board immediately, they gain huge value in a turn or two if you have tempo.  These are cards like Nerubian Egg, Piloted Shredder, the Giants and the like. No immediate effect, but value moving forward, and largely value when playing from ahead, but not hugely susceptible when playing from behind."

Then take out a Shiv and add an Antique Healbot (or both Shivs for two Healbots, since you're running your face into stuff a lot, but that comes down to preference I guess). Other than that, it looks solid. The only other change I might make is subbing Geomancer for Auto-Barber, but that's personal preference, too.

At 6 wins on turn 7 against a mage you know she has flamestrike, here, not necessarily, it could be Mini-mage and arcane explosion. (Cards not picked in Arena.) It is more casual because you don't feel burdened and pressured to at least get 6 wins, especially for newer players or those who literally can't take the pressure, which is a real thing.  Also there is more class diversity than any other Brawl or mode. I could actually play against Shaman and Warrior for once compared to Arena, so that was nice."

In my case (having most of the cards) I still agree with you. In the brawls where you make your own deck it's really fun initially but then after 2-3 days a meta arises and 1-2 decks just seem quite overpowered turning it into an ""assimilate or die"" sort of deckbuilding.  The meta doesn't arise in brawls that don't have deck construction so while their peak fun may be less (because you can't play around with what you get and do weird shenanigans with less frequently used cards) they tend to have more staying power."

Out of the 50-60 games I played, maybe 5, 6 were actually close battles with decks of approximately the same power.  The rest were one-sided stomps. Either by me or my opponent.  Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this brawl (hence the 50-60 games played). But it would've been nice to have some kind of normalization between decks. No need for PERFECT balance, but at least half the games should be close-ish."
hearthstone,3dxbur,TextingGuy,3,Mon Jul 20 08:55:33 2015 UTC,It's the one-sidedness that made me hate this week's brawl. Many times my hand would be filled with 7+ drops and I'd be unable to play anything in the mid game. I feel like skill mattered much less than usual this week.

I had a crazy one last night before it ended, playing druid vs a rogue. They ended up playing Millhouse and Lorewalker Cho (I think they just wanted a fun game, as they seemed to vaguely know what they were doing), but I didn't have much in my hand, so they stayed stuck on the board. Much trading and milling of each others hands ensued without much damage being done. I also had a blingtron and Harrison Jones which ended up being played three times as he got sapped once, brewmastered by me and then eventually he had to cast vanish. We both were playing with almost full hands all game so the number of options got ridiculous and especially when I played Nodzormu... Crazy Crazy game.  Had a number of games almost as fun, which I think outweighed the games where I got stomped by turn 4 (Funny how your desperation tinkmaster always turns his wisp into a dragon in those circumstances....)

Although, if I could rank a brawl twice, i would put Summoner Brawl on the top slot and the second slot. It was THAT good. Like, it was significantly better than any of the other brawls.

hearthstone,3dxbur,ZippyWayne,2,Mon Jul 20 14:31:02 2015 UTC,Your deck consisted of a ton of webspinners and I want to say 7(I think) spells random spells from the class you chose. (Pre-made deck)
hearthstone,3dxbur,Gyroscope13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:31 2015 UTC,"I think it was more spells than that but yeah, all minions were webspinners and the spells in your class were randomly picked.

hearthstone,3dxbur,Malphael,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:16:55 2015 UTC,What I like about Webspinner brawl was that there were clearly optimal choices for classes.
hearthstone,3dxbur,wildclaw,11,Mon Jul 20 23:19:23 2015 UTC,"it was 100% random, which gets old REAL fast.    Apaprently not if you rank Summoner brawl that highly. It and Nefarian brawl have been by far the most random so far with extreme variance in card quality per mana spent.  With Spider and Crossroads challenges you got random cards, but you still had to pay the somewhat fair mana for them (it does however suck that some cards in hearthstone are so obviously inferior to others).  Banana was the least random. Sure, you had the +2/+2 banana which were strictly better, but you generally got enough bananas every game that the result tended to be fairly balanced."
hearthstone,3dxbur,NC-Lurker,5,Mon Jul 20 19:44:11 2015 UTC,"This brawl was 100% random, you have no idea what your deck is, nor your opponent's. At least Nefarian/Rag had set decks, so after a couple of games you know how to mulligan, what cards to play around, which counters you want to save, etc. And summoner brawl had variance through minion summoning, but you're still the one building the deck. You know exactly which 30 cards you can expect. You also paid ""fair mana"" for every card, since the summoned minions were limited by their cost."
hearthstone,3dxbur,Vintage91,6,Mon Jul 20 12:10:10 2015 UTC,"But to me, that was the problem with the Summoner brawl. You have to have the cards already. I had some fun with my Druid that week, only because it is my most played class so I have some spells. But many of the other classes were horrible for me to try due to not having any good spells. As a relatively new player, this brawl, The Crossroads, was my favourite so far.   The Crossroads Nef/Rag Summoner Webspinner Banana"
hearthstone,3dxbur,NC-Lurker,2,Mon Jul 20 13:15:48 2015 UTC,"Right, I took it from the PoV of a somewhat veteran player who has at least most spells in the game. Spells aren't legendaries, and very few are epic (right now I can only think of 3 for druid, and fewer for any other class) so anyone should be able to afford a decent spell-deck for that brawl. The above comment was aimed mostly at the strategical depth of brawls, and what the previous guy called variance. Random unknown deck leads to more variance than a deck you built yourself, I thought that much was clear.  Tbh I see why this brawl would be enticing to a new player, it's basically the poor man's arena, or what casual mode should be. If you don't have cards/adventures/gold, you cant compete on the ladder past a certain point (and before that it's still a struggle) and you cant spam arena. Once you go infinite tho, arena is just so much more fun than this brawl."
hearthstone,3dxbur,Vintage91,2,Mon Jul 20 13:45:04 2015 UTC,"I just find it to be a nice break from ""try-harding"". After playing Arena and ranked, some nice silly and possibly stupid tavern brawl is good. But when it comes down to already owning the cards, I have limited dust available to me that I won't spend on otherwise useless minions or spells.  That being said, I do see your point as someone who already has most of the things in the game. But that's why I like these brawls. It gives me a break from facing players who have Sylvanas, Rag, Boom, and whatever other legendary card they got/crafted."
hearthstone,3dxbur,narquis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:13:02 2015 UTC,"""Fair mana"" depending on the minion you got.  Get a minion with a passive board effect or death rattle? Great!  Get a minion with a positive battlecry and you lose out.  Getting a novice engineer or doomsayer from a 2-mana spell felt distinctly lackluster.  There are also some classes which are far more dependent upon non-spell cards, which made them weaker in the Summoner Brawl."
hearthstone,3dxbur,acamas,2,Mon Jul 20 15:47:53 2015 UTC,Apaprently not if you rank Summoner brawl that highly.   You could construct your own deck though... only the summoned minions were random (from a specific mana count.)
hearthstone,3dxbur,N0V0w3ls,2,Mon Jul 20 15:46:27 2015 UTC,"For me it was:   Summoner Banana Nef vs Rag Webspinner RNG premade   I like the brawls where I make a deck a lot more. And even though Summoner had a lot of RNG, it was still able to be influenced through the cards you played and a tempo meta eventually developed that was really fun. I couldn't stand this brawl. You had no control over anything and felt a lot like a computer was playing for me. I'm hoping the theory of every other week being a ""build-your-own"" week is correct, since that means I should enjoy this week's brawl."
hearthstone,3dxbur,kaian-a-coel,3,Mon Jul 20 17:14:25 2015 UTC,"I'd exchange nef/rag and webspinner brawls' ranks, but otherwise I do agree. This week's brawl was mostly infuriating with a couple funny moments interspersed throughout. I found it only marginally better than the banana brawl, and only because it was different from ladder.  Summoner, webspinner and this week's brawls are all RNG brawls, but for webspinner it was limited to beasts (which makes it somewhat less bad), and for summoner it was bound to spell cost, so there was some amount of strategy involved, in deck making, in when to cast a spell, and the RNG element was ultimately within the ""consistently fun"" boundaries. Not in the ""near zero agency"" bullshit no-fun wasteland."

Every single week has involved a very RNG based element that has kinda forced how the game goes. Ironically the Banana Brawl gets the most hate yet is probably the least affected by RNG.  Summoner Brawl was given high scores yet it's by far the most RNG. What about that wasn't 100% RNG getting old real fast?  I don't get what people want. You all love RNG. But it's a reason why you don't like a given Brawl? I'm confused.

Very little about Summoner Brawl was RNG. Pretty much the only thing that was RNG about it was the minions you go from the summoning.  The thing about Summoner Brawl was that the RNG was very controllable because you got to build a deck knowing the mechanics of the game.
hearthstone,3dxbur,byanyothernombre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:16:46 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the only thing that was RNG about it was the minions you go from the summoning.   those minions define that brawl though? i mean, piloted shredder is one of the first cards people point to when talking about how rng-heavy hearthstone is, and the summoner brawl gave every spell you played a shredder-like effect. there are massive differences between minions of the same mana cost. also throwing 30 spells together is not much of a deckbuilding experience. i enjoy the summoner brawl and it's possible to get ""good"" at it but there is definitely a lot of rng involved."
hearthstone,3dxbur,Malphael,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:49:46 2015 UTC,"The thing with summoner brawl though is that it gave you agency over the RNG.   Lets say I am playing summoner brawl. What do I know from that:  I know when I play a spell, I will get a creature with the same mana cost as well.  What does that tell me:   Tempo is important.  I better have spells that will be good no matter what creatures I get Buffs are important because they can round out a bad creature  I better put spells in my deck that summon from a good pool of potential creatures.    This is part of why for example Druid and Priest were so popular. Both have a lot of strong buff cards and Druid especially in the early game was able to do sick plays like Innervate, Wild Growth, Coin, Power of the Wild and suddenly they have a huge board  Meanwhile, in this week's brawl, you are literally at the whim of whatever junk the game randomly puts in your deck. Two totemic might and a Secret Keeper in your Shaman deck? Tough luck bro.   There's nothing you can do in that regard to minimize the RNG. With the Summoner Brawl you could build around the RNG, minimize it, and abuse it"
hearthstone,3dxbur,byanyothernombre,0,Mon Jul 20 22:46:47 2015 UTC,"yeah there's obviously less rng than in this week's brawl but there's still an awful lot of it. and i think you're making it sound more strategic than it is. each class only has so many spells and the different classes' strengths are fairly intuitive and were worked out by lots of people within an hour of playing. druid is the best because it has everything in spell form -- buffs, aoe, single-target damage, draw, options cards, hero attack, charge, resets, stickiness in the form of soul of the forest, and most importantly ramp cards which are absurdly good when they immediately impact the board by producing minions. and if two druids are facing each other with the same no-brainer deck, the summoner rng becomes a major factor. you can try to ""mitigate"" it, but if your opponent gets better rng and is using the same mitigation tools they're likely to come out ahead."
hearthstone,3dxbur,YodaGandalfDumbled0r,13,Mon Jul 20 23:07:40 2015 UTC,"I'm probably going to get downvoted for this but the more I play this brawl, the more I like the Banana Brawl. People keep complaining about how everyone plays Tempo Mage in the Week 2 Brawl, but it actually pushes the Hearthstone community's creativity further and eventually anti-Tempo Mage Brawl decks were made. For example /u/Noxious_HS made a Giants Shaman deck which did surprisingly well against Tempo Mage archetypes.  This week's brawl on the other hand, is a complete RNGfest which encourages no creativity at all. It maybe ""good for new players"" but for those who have been playing this game for months, RNG will eventually erode your spirit. For me and many others, Tavern Brawl is supposed to be a great way to relieve yourself from the cancer and salt of Ranked play.  So far my ranking goes like this: 1. Summoner Brawl 2. Blackrock Brawl 3. Banana Brawl 4. Crossroads Brawl 5. Webspinner Brawl"

hearthstone,3dxbur,Kaiminus,2,Mon Jul 20 12:32:48 2015 UTC,"It's a bit early, but I did a small graph summarizing the polls : http://imgur.com/Ci0ZZpI I ordered them by the % of people who liked each brawl."
hearthstone,3dxbur,Insacuri,2,Mon Jul 20 12:49:27 2015 UTC,"Absolutely loved it.  I really enjoy arena cause you have to play with some really average decks sometimes, but I hate playing vs mage like 80% of the time (yes I get it you got 3+ flamestrikes, you're a much better player then I am >_>).  This was like playing arena where you get to play against all 9 classes instead of the same few most of the time."
hearthstone,3dxbur,StealthTomato,2,Mon Jul 20 12:58:02 2015 UTC,"Favorite moment of the week: Bestial Wrath gets stolen by a Spellbender, causing me to nearly rope out due to laughter."
hearthstone,3dxbur,Forestbahn,2,Mon Jul 20 13:27:51 2015 UTC,"The only Brawl better than this one was the Summoner's Brawl, in my opinion. I loved the completely random decks, having the opportunity to play with stuff like Elite Tauren Chieftain and Gelbin Mekkatorque, and being able to do the dailies with any class easily."
hearthstone,3dxbur,PlayfulMuskrat,2,Mon Jul 20 14:50:16 2015 UTC,I played this one more than any other... even though it was the simplest of all so far.
hearthstone,3dxbur,kornholyoyo,2,Mon Jul 20 16:12:26 2015 UTC,"This was the best brawl to do quests in. Made for interesting gameplay and you could play just about any class.   It wasn't the best, but I wouldn't mind seeing it again."
hearthstone,3dxbur,ph8fourTwenty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:17:51 2015 UTC,My only problem with this brawl is lack of oversight. I think a few specific cards should have been removed from the pool for certain classes. The 3rd game in a row I drew a Mad Scientist on a class with no secrets got a little annoying.
hearthstone,3dxbur,leigonlord,4,Mon Jul 20 16:39:59 2015 UTC,"this brawl wasnt bad, but the others were better."
hearthstone,3dxbur,czhihong,3,Mon Jul 20 19:10:51 2015 UTC,"It was decent I thought, much better than initial impressions at least. We probably had expectations raised too high immediately after last week's format, which explained the strong negative first reactions, but I thought a fair number of people changed their opinions about it.  I can see how it would really appeal to those who are just starting out and do not have a large collection, that's probably the main target for this brawl. Of course, it also serves as a great place to just play random decks (to clear quests), not having to put together a deck and being able to just press ""play"" with a random deck felt strangely liberating. Sometimes you just feel like playing casually and I thought this was a great way to do so.  The great thing about brawls is that they can (and often do) appeal to different groups of people on different weeks, though of course there will still be some that are more broadly appealing than others."
hearthstone,3dxbur,iFius,3,Mon Jul 20 12:13:21 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a very fun, casual brawl. I like playing arena over today's constructed meta, but I can't win enough games to keep doing it endlessly. This brawl gave me the arena experience while being stress-free. I racked up about 90 wins, which is a lot for me since I don't usually play more games than what's needed to complete daily quests."
hearthstone,3dxbur,fuck_the_haters_,3,Mon Jul 20 09:27:39 2015 UTC,"It was boring 1st, but I had so many fun moments.  I think my favorite was when I was playing hunter I ran into a mage with 3 mirror entities.  He eventually stole my yesera and Illidan (two legendaries I never had and had fun playing).  I eventually brought him down to 12 hp and it was my last turn and he had lethal I draw my last card and it was misdirection.  I just played it said well played and passed my turn.  It's his turn he nightmares illidan and hits my face only for my misdirection to send Illidan back to his face giving me the win.  Got me to play a class I don't play at all, got me to play legendaries and epics I don't have, but most important got me fine to the concept of losing and still having fun."
hearthstone,3dxbur,Maestro_Da_Vinci,3,Mon Jul 20 13:20:31 2015 UTC,"To me this was the best Tavern Brawl of all. I'm a new player so a lot of the Legionaries, Epics, Rares or even  most common cards i don't know and a lot of times i really don't know what to expect, so this week provided me with a great view of future cards i might get and how to use them and not to."
hearthstone,3dxbur,B4R0Z,5,Mon Jul 20 13:33:38 2015 UTC,"Totally my favourite one so far, I actually hoped it would come out since I've been already playing that way with a friend (autofilling decks), but it was limited to the card pool, so this was way better (also high legendary rate!)"
hearthstone,3dxbur,Ju1ss1,3,Mon Jul 20 13:40:47 2015 UTC,"It was a great Brawl and should be put as a permanent game mode (maybe replace casual).   What made it great? There were no netdecks, unusual cards, fun gameplay, no netdecks. It actually felt like how Hearthstone felt in a beginning of beta when I joined. People having less than optimal decks and going back and forth actually solving the puzzle."
hearthstone,3dxbur,distilledwill,2,Mon Jul 20 10:55:48 2015 UTC,Loved it. Got a mage deck with 4 flamewalkers and 2 echo of medhivs. Was good times.

hearthstone,3dxbur,MalHeartsNutmeg,2,Tue Jul 21 07:57:51 2015 UTC,I liked this weeks brawl it allowed for some crazy combos.  My favourite was T8 Onyxia into t9 Enhanco + Savage roar.
hearthstone,3dxbur,ger0000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:35:54 2015 UTC,"On the other hand however, if you had no luck, you could only make crazy combos like I did. T8 2 parrot and 2 cannons. That was all I had in my hand. Turns out, I have no pirate in the deck.   It isn't much fun when you have to play 8 games just to get the pack."

hearthstone,3dxbur,playtech1,2,Mon Jul 20 14:37:30 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed this less than the Spiders and the Summoners, but I actually played it more.  I think the thing this had going for it was that it was totally unfair, but in a way that produced really interesting plays."
hearthstone,3dxbur,mda924,2,Mon Jul 20 13:48:05 2015 UTC,"This was the best one so far imo, even though its very similar to arena."
hearthstone,3dxbur,Jimmyshoeshoe,2,Mon Jul 20 13:49:32 2015 UTC,I really liked this brawl. Some games were mismatched but I got to play a lot of cards I wouldnt usually be able to otherwise. All those late game legendaries were fun too

Also, I don't know what the chance of getting a legendary was, but I swear I got like 4 in one game, shit was crazy - it's nice to play with big cards a poor scrub like me doesn't usually get."
hearthstone,3dxbur,mistery_Germany,2,Mon Jul 20 14:36:56 2015 UTC,It was the best and still think this should become the Casual mode.
hearthstone,3dxbur,mxloco27,2,Mon Jul 20 14:53:32 2015 UTC,I got over 50 wins in this one. I think it was amazing! I wanted this to be Hearthstone from the beginning!
hearthstone,3dxbur,FredAsta1re,2,Mon Jul 20 16:07:07 2015 UTC,"I really hated it because of shitty RNG, but it was fun against friends. My favorite moment was my own ""the only way I can win is deathwing"" top deck out of nowhere.  Some of the decks were crazy though. A friend and I cycled our whole decks for the fun of it and his had 9 legendary minions and mine had 2"
hearthstone,3dxbur,Aperture45,2,Mon Jul 20 16:22:06 2015 UTC,"My favourite so far. I didn't think it was that great to begin with, but it had so much more re playability for me than any other brawl.  I'd probably rank them  1 Crossroads brawl 2 Webspinner brawl 3 Nef vs Rag 4 Summoners brawl 5 Banana brawl"
hearthstone,3dxbur,ClosertothesunNA,2,Mon Jul 20 17:17:36 2015 UTC,Such a refreshing brawl! Proper trading and decision making rather than the same old stale decks on ladder. Hopefully it'll be back soon!

hearthstone,3dxbur,Vanbone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:25:23 2015 UTC,"I got about 90 wins and was salty through about 80 of them. I know it was supposed to be complete chaos , but when you draw 4 feign deaths in a row or stat with 3 malygoses its kinda discouraging. If they redo this i would like it to be just a tiny bit balanced (like the curve isnt 30 one drops or something like that).  Overall, one of the more fun brawls."
hearthstone,3dxbur,vontasben,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:27:25 2015 UTC,"It seemed like a lot of people were down on this week, but I liked it. As a f2p, it gave me more chance to try out classes I don't normally play. Full-random decks is a play style that some people have enjoyed with friends for a while, so while there wasn't anything mind-blowingly innovative about it, this seemed like an obvious and solid brawl."
hearthstone,3dxbur,MstrKief,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:37:55 2015 UTC,I'd have enjoyed this week's brawl more if I could have seen the deck list. Not having any idea what I might draw into made it very tough to make good decisions.
hearthstone,3dxbur,The_Dacca,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:49:22 2015 UTC,"I saw 4 Jaraxuses at once because of this brawl. It was pretty swell. I let my opponent live so I could play my third one, and he played one too (not in the screenshot)  http://i.imgur.com/h66Kv3A.jpg"
hearthstone,3dxbur,shitbangingmotherfuc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:59:40 2015 UTC,"I didn't like this week's brawl mostly because I habitually suffer from bad RNG.  My last match went like this: He played Hogger and I didn't have any removal or charge minions (totally blaming draws) so I play whatever I can that turn and next turn they play Troggzor.  Still draw bad and play what I can and then they play Kel'Thuzad.  This is kinda how all my matches went, I look at my hand try to figure something out and my opponent starts throwing legendaries  or crazy combos.  Didn't have fun, but I can see how others may."

Yet I ended up playing it more than any other brawl. And, in the process, I got to play or play against what I think was every single legendary in the game. (Shout out to my opponent who held on for another turn in an unwinnable match seemingly just to play Elite Tauren Chieftain.)"
hearthstone,3dxbur,abuttfarting,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:44:33 2015 UTC,I loved it.  The fact that I saw so many cards that I have never seen used in a game was refreshing.
hearthstone,3dxbur,helix400,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:48:25 2015 UTC,Loved it to death. My absolute favorite among all brawls so far. I really enjoyed hassle-free daily completing as well as getting to play with cards I don't have without the pressure that comes with playing arena.  edit: I won a game my buffing a Flying Machine with a Metaltooth Leaper. I'm still grinning about that.
hearthstone,3dxbur,macheesmo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:48:27 2015 UTC,"I never went beyond 3 wins in any of the other brawls.  This one felt like true casual mode.  I played it up to 15 wins.  I also had more fun in this brawl with weird game states.  The last game I played Tirion, opponent followed up with Mal'Ganis.  Then I played my second Tirion.  Opponent played his second Mal'Ganis.  Then I played my third Tirion.  He played his third Mal'Ganis.  That's the kind of awesomeness that didn't show up in any of the previous brawls."
hearthstone,3dxbur,HiperEg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:01:25 2015 UTC,"I thought it was fun but whatever card pool they were using could use some work.  For example, I played about 20 games of warrior and never had a Acolyte of Pain in my deck which is a common card that is a warrior staple.  I would like to see a similar brawl bit with random 12 win arena decks. Guardsman Bob suggested a mode like this once before brawl even existed.  It would be nice to play with random decks that have synergy to them."

You should include the title of the Brawl that week or a brief description of it in the Strawpoll's title and in the thread. None of them mention anything about their respective Brawls you're referencing."

I'm more of an on-curve guy than a setup-for-a-big-play guy, so I was stressing out in most games when I was going turn 1, 2, 3 with barely playing anything. And the fact that games were decided basically before Turn 1 with a deck you had no hand in.... the RNG in Spiders and Summoner was fun but this one wasn't my thing."
hearthstone,3dxbur,glad0s98,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:42:49 2015 UTC,My favorite brawl so far. First time I can say that Rend Blackhand or Hemet Nesingwary or Gelbin Mekkatorque straight up won me a game.

I also enjoyed the randomness of the opponents deck, there was no way to predict which cards the opponent has or what is opponents deck structure. In normal mode you always counter same decks...  But I still didn't enjoy this one as much as previous ones. It was too random because I didn't know which cards were in my own deck! For me it would have been better if there had been a way to see your own randomized deck before entering the battle."
hearthstone,3dxbur,monsterm1dget,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:00:03 2015 UTC,"This brawl was a toss up for me. Some games my deck was just completely horrible like grimscale oracle with no synergy and my opponents deck looked like a 7+ win arena deck. Othertimes the games were more onesided on my end and I'd have something silly like two of Jaraxxus or two Tirions and two Bolhvars. Really had fun playing with cards I didn't own though.   http://puu.sh/j52qu/a9abdde2f9.png I laughed histerically when this combo happened.   I feel like if both player's decks had some kind of controlled RNG so they both had near equal in power decks going into it, it would've been a lot more fun for both sides involved."
hearthstone,3dxbur,Imbris,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:03:27 2015 UTC,Boring IMO but I find a lot of people liked it. The Banana Brawl is still the one I enjoyed the most despite the huge ammount of tempo mages.
hearthstone,3dxbur,nw712,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:23:48 2015 UTC,"This has been the worst brawl yet. It has also been the best brawl yet.  Half the time a game has ended in incredible frustration - usually due to the opponent having a completely OP deck while I draw Wisps (yesterday someone dropped Rags turns 8 and 9). The other half of the time...you keep drawing legendaries and destroy your opponent and it feels so good (even though the skill required was minimal).  Overall, I had fun, but I can't wait for the next brawl which will probably require more skill."
hearthstone,3dxbur,a_rabid_squirrel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:56:01 2015 UTC,"This was definitely my least favorite one. I played it twice and then just lost interest. I do think this brawl proved one thing though: Give players access to all cards during future brawls.   My friend that just started playing the game absolutely loved this brawl because he got to play with cards that he's never used before. Since Brawl is not ""competitive"" I think giving access to all the cards to players would be a great way to help new players. Not just in having a solid deck for some of these brawls, but just for enjoying cards they might not gain access for a bit. This is suppose to be a fun and relaxed experience, right?   I'd love to see a bit more refined poll in the future. I have a feeling newbies or players that don't have access to a ton of cards loved this brawl much more then veterans did."
hearthstone,3dxbur,rubymatrix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:03:36 2015 UTC,"It was a lot of fun, but honestly every game I played had a clear winner or loser by turn 3.  If you choose rogue and end up with three vanishes in your starting hand, you're going to have a bad time.  Conversely, I played a match where I dropped legendaries on turns 5, 6, 7, and 8 and absolutely crushed an opponent without adequate answers.  So yeah, it was fun, but only in the sense it made flipping a coin fun."
hearthstone,3dxbur,Kenos300,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:33:44 2015 UTC,"What I really liked about this brawl is the randomness of cards forcing players to see combo's and interactions that haven't been exploited in the current meta-game.  Gazlowe and Conceal are pretty cool together, it's inspired a new version of Mech Rogue for me.  What I disliked about this brawl was almost the same thing.  It was just a bit too random.  ""Luck"" wasn't just RNG of card effects, but the complete randomness of the cards drawn.  That timely light-bomb, SW:D, Pyroblast, Brawl, or other clutch cards stung just a bit too much.  Each game felt like a coin-flip that you didn't realize the outcome of until it was too late.  It seemed that this brawl was determined by other factors and not player skill (although, skill did have an affect, just not as much as sheer luck).  Even in the Nef vs Rags brawl, drawing Rags was still fun, as you sometimes felt like you were the underdog, which is cool!"
hearthstone,3dxbur,frostedWarlock,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:10:48 2015 UTC,"I'm really shocked that so many people disliked this week or thought it was only ""okay."" It was essentially (not exactly, but essentially) free Arena decks, and almost no pressure because the cards would fall where they may. I know that a lot of us, perhaps rightfully, hate RNG and this was RNG central, but RNG is what Hearthstone is all about so I didn't think it would bother so many people so much. Especially when you don't lose anything by playing Brawls.  For my part I actually got to play and enjoy the two classes I dislike using the most (Druid and Priest) since I didn't have to worry about having literally none of their good cards. It was just ""oh hey let's play some priest"" and I had a blast."
hearthstone,3dxbur,ratbum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:37:01 2015 UTC,"I genuinely hated this brawl. Even when I had the Cast 40 Spells quest and decided ""okay, let's just try to have fun with this, i don't need to win to get my gold"", all it did was enrage me how shit my luck was, and how even when I won it was such a curbstomp that didn't feel satisfying.   Summoner's Brawl Banana Brawl Webspinner Brawl Nef Vs Rag Brawl Next Week's Brawl Crossroads Brawl   I know how hyperbolic that sounds but I genuinely don't think anything coming next week could be worse than this brawl, and if it somehow does then I think I'll lose all interest in Tavern Brawl at that point."

hearthstone,3dxbur,Eremoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:47:52 2015 UTC,This is probably my new favourite Brawl. Summoner and Webspinner were great but felt repetitive over time. With a complete new deck every time and the possibility to play with many legendaries I don't have I had lots of fun this week.
hearthstone,3dxbur,N0V0w3ls,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:47:00 2015 UTC,I didn't like it at all. Felt like arena decks with crappy cards and crappy curve except you got few legendaries in the mix. just my opinion anyway. Hope the next one is 30 unstable portals
hearthstone,3dxbur,zondabaka,-2,Mon Jul 20 19:02:35 2015 UTC,This brawl was easily last place for me. My first deck gave me nothing to play until turn 5. After that I got the unbalanced deck with a perfect curve that the opponent had no answer to. It wasn't even a fun win. After I got my pack it was over. I'm even F2P with a very incomplete collection and I was frustrated with the lack of input from my side.
hearthstone,3dxbur,stevebobby,-2,Mon Jul 20 12:43:37 2015 UTC,"And the cycle of ""hate brawl on the first day, say it was great on the last day"" continues."
hearthstone,3dxbur,wugs,0,Mon Jul 20 12:06:36 2015 UTC,"just a suggestion.  I would be helpful to have the name of the brawl in the title of the poll, ie:  ""Overall, did you enjoy the ""Encounter at the Crossroads"" Tavern Brawl?""  The reason being, after 5 weeks, it's relatively easy to remember, but say 20 weeks from now could you easily tell me what Brawl happened on Week 5?"
hearthstone,3dxbur,Snack_Happy,0,Mon Jul 20 12:23:03 2015 UTC,"As a relatively new player, it was my first time ever getting to be the one playing Dr. Boom at an annoyingly convenient time. 7/7 would explode again.  But honestly, it was a fun matchup to see cards I never see. It was several days of never having to worry about creating decks to grind through quests (I really only play mage and sometimes warlock) because even if your deck sucks, the other person's probably does to the same degree. (Gotta love getting all those weapon synergy cards playing Priest.)"
hearthstone,3dxbur,Hollowness_hots,0,Mon Jul 20 14:08:59 2015 UTC,"Being a new player of like 2 weeks, this brawl was really fun. I won about 17 games of it even. One thing that made it good I believe was that it forced you, as a new player, to read every card. This helps reinforce card knowledge which is pivotal in any CCG. Definitely fun! Also enjoyed playing with legendary cards. Got Ragnaros in a few decks while top decking. Tides were turned."
hearthstone,3dxbur,PesterThePatient,0,Mon Jul 20 16:48:27 2015 UTC,personally this is the only one i did play like crazy. all other was kinda bad for me because i dont have many cards and that make my decks sucks a lot. but in this format you get a complete deck.

hearthstone,3e3p43,cluo40,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:02 2015 UTC,I'm surprised it took so long for this combo to be used effectively.   It's been used since hearthstone started in aggro warrior. Patron and deaths bite just made it more consistent
hearthstone,3e3p43,Shaddow1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:24 2015 UTC,Um... it requires setup in a 4/5 card combo. We have a lot of combos that can do this. Also requires a full board.  A Ooze and Loetheb blocks this combo instantly.
hearthstone,3e3p43,AlricPhoenix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:17 2015 UTC,"I agree, this would be a reasonable yet not overkill nerf to patron warrior.  Make the warsong text read ""Your minions with 3 or less attack have charge""  (So it would be a similar interaction to the Southsea Deckhand, who looses charge if you use up your weapon before you attack.)  This would also be an indirect nerf to Inner Rage and Cruel Taskmaster."
hearthstone,3e1yu2,FrakTheGods19,2,Tue Jul 21 09:43:56 2015 UTC,I would say something like 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36 for both boom bots in face and 1/36 * 3/16 = 1/192 for them to hit face for at least seven.

Comparing mine to it (which reached legend last season and should, even though the meta changed since then, still work looking at my current data), the only thing, that stands out is the lack of the second acolyte. Acolytes are the warrior's only draw-engine, and I feel like it's needed to keep up with most decks out there.   Double brawl is an interesting meta-call. It's weak to hunter, so if you run into them a lot, I'd consider cutting one. If you encounter a lot of zoo, patron warrior and other midrange decks (like paladin), it's good to have two of them.  I don't really think, there is a use for Thaurissan in a control-warrior list, since it normally doesn't get much value, especially not with only one acolyte, so I'd consider cutting that card for the second drawer."

For example, I remember seeing mockups of phone UI and the initial screenshots were always what things look like when two players are playing on small phones with 7 Al'akirs in play and 10 cards in each of their hands. I think when you start with the craziest most flooded environments you get a better idea if an interface is on the right track.  Anyway, it looks cool.

Realistically how are you doing 90 damage and winning with face hunter? How are you even surviving?  To win you would need to play Handlock or something that has tons of potential damage and healing and board clear. But even that would mill out before winning.

hearthstone,3dvevh,Godofallu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:59:13 2015 UTC,"The problem is that if you play handlock, you will die very soon. If you think you can get away with tapping even one turn, all the other people know whats up. So they turn to attack you.  Maybe facehunters aren't good enough. But I suspect zoo will be dominant. It's all about having a very early presence, to either dish out damage and punish slow decks and as an deterrent to other aggro decks attacking you. Anyways, it's not going to work. It will require a whole new set of cards and maybe bigger decks and life totals."

When one comrade falls, it switches technically to 2v1, because your mate only helps you (plays minoins on your board etc)  This adds a lot of strategic elements and new tactis. For phone users, you see only the board of the guy who plays currently. If its your turn, you can decide to help him, and switch the view of the boards (you go to the other board)  This way mobile AND desktop dont get seperated.

hearthstone,3dvevh,EvoR,3,Mon Jul 20 03:33:56 2015 UTC,"Players across from one another play. It's two simultaneous games of Hearthstone, but both players of team A need to have completed their turn before both players of team B can begin theirs to keep everyone synchronized. You shorten the rope time to 30 seconds to keep the format moving. The real fun begins when a player from a team is eliminated. The victorious player on team A takes a turn to 'fuse' into a two-headed giant facing against the remaining player on team B. Team A still takes a simultaneous turn against the remaining Team B player. So long as two members remain on A, any damage or spell effect dealt to either player on A by team B occurs to both. Any effect that occurs to 'all characters' or 'all minions' effects both boards -- IE; if I am on B and I consecrate one player on A, damage is done to the boards both team A players. The game remains in this state until the remaining B player is eliminated or one of the players on A is eliminated -- in the latter case, the game continues as a 1v1.  Play test will determine if increasing deck size for this format is appropriate, or if perhaps 5 cards from the 'graveyard' are mixed back into every player's deck after a player is eliminated."
hearthstone,3dvevh,bassinastor,2,Mon Jul 20 03:43:47 2015 UTC,"Just couldn't see 1v1v1v1 working like this.  2v2 would be far more appropriate. My idea would be: You share a 60 card deck with a card drawn from each deck each turn, same as it is now. The turn order alternates in a cirle: player 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B.  In this way, you and your teammate share a deck comprised of 2 different classes cards, where you can mix and match class cards and hero powers.  This mode would work with both friends and random teammates due to it using 2 30 card decks that are shuffled together.  The UI would just have both team's heroes on the top or bottom. Players can draw and play teammates cards but can only use their individual hero power. Hero health is shared at either 30 or 60 and teams share the same standard 7 minion slots.  I think this mode would be great because it could even be played 1v1 in a mode called something like 'Duel decks'."

With the addition of hero powers such as the Hunter's I personally just don't see it happening even though i want it to so so much.  A way to fix the hunter hero power would be for it to do 2 damage to a random opponent but even then the amount of cards that'd need to be changed and other assets just show that blizzard isn't planning on making 4 player possible."

hearthstone,3dvevh,AndybioticsPala,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:01:41 2015 UTC,"What about a back to back game mode where the winners fight each other with their current state after they win. So you have to play not just to win your game but also have enough left to play against the second. The game board would be set up like this so you could keep track of cards used and then maybe aoe and rng affects the whole board in some turn based delay (game 1, player 1; game 1, player 2; game 2, player 1; game 2, player 2). Of course a concede would just cancel the winners playing each other and then some other rules would need to be in place to make it fair."

Also, there's the fact that the game is ""balanced"" around the game being 2v2, there are certain cards that would be OP as fk in 4man games (specially those that trigger from AOE effects), such as: frothing berseker, northshire cleric, MTC depending on if it's player targeted or not, flesheating ghoul, UTH etc.  Also classes that depend on rushing/bursting (namely all non control decks, such as all kind of hunters, aggro decks, face decks, etc) would struggle so much that slow control classes like priest, warrior, freeze mage and maybe handlock, would be OP as hell.

hearthstone,3dwfi8,Jahkral,9,Mon Jul 20 17:18:00 2015 UTC,"This is, honestly, the usual thing that happens with millhouse.  You just get a nice minion.  Sometimes they do a really inefficient play because 'omg free' and are down cards for the rest of the game."

hearthstone,3dwfi8,Han_Solo_Burger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:29:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's extremely fucking good. To put it in perspective, Dark Cultist has amazing stats at 3/4 for 3 mana. It's just that it has probably the worst card effect in the game which makes it unplayable despite its amazing stats."
hearthstone,3dwfi8,Endymob,3,Mon Jul 20 20:52:13 2015 UTC,"Well the real problem is how the effect scales over time. Free spells on turn 2 is rarely very bad, but on turn six or ten free spells is deadly. So Milhouse becomes a dead card if not in the opening hand."
hearthstone,3dwfi8,iBeej,4,Mon Jul 20 22:00:14 2015 UTC,"Arcane Intellect for sure.  However, if I couldn't be sure I had lethal, I wouldn't have burned those spells.  But that's just me!  Sounds like your gamble paid off.  But it could have gone VERY BAD for you too.  ;)"
hearthstone,3dwfi8,pastabolicles,8,Mon Jul 20 18:11:11 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking about this a couple days ago when I saw Millhouse coined out on turn 1 against a Mage, and the ""Double pyroblast!"" spam started happening in Twitch chat.  It seems like people are most afraid to play Millhouse against Mage, but maybe the hidden value of playing him is that people will use their removal stupidly.  If it's turn 6 and your opponent has a 4/4 on board, and you flame cannon the 4/4... and your only other playable card is a fireball or you ping and pass, it would be widely criticized to go face with the fireball unless you are a pure aggro/burn deck.  So why is someone going ""Fireball, Fireball, Frostbolt"" to face for 15 damage on turn 1 a good play?  Sure you get the guy low, but now you're at a huge card disadvantage and a long way from lethal.  I think the scarier opponent to play Millhouse against would be a Druid who might get a free double Wild Growth, or be hanging on to a Nourish, or god forbid they have a double combo in hand."
hearthstone,3dwfi8,Floirt,13,Mon Jul 20 10:08:58 2015 UTC,The scariest thing you can see as someone playing Millhouse is a Mage playing Unstable Portals and Arcane Intellects. Priest playing Mind Control + buffs is also a good one. There's also the classic Rogue Sprint into Eviscerate into -insert miracle bullshit here-.

hearthstone,3dwfi8,Purebredbacon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:21:55 2015 UTC,How does millhouse work in a murloc druid? Wouldn't he just make it easier for your opponent to dump his removal and clean your board while building his? Or do you only use it early to bait spell waste?
hearthstone,3dwfi8,hoorahforsnakes,2,Mon Jul 20 12:41:41 2015 UTC,"I haven't used it that often, but basically i use it because it is a 4/4 for 2. And i mostly drop him on an empty, or nearly empty, board. The free removal stuff is often over-exaggerated. A lot of times they end up not having the right spells in their hand and he ends up working great. The biggest problem is against mage, but then mages are strong anti-murloc decks anyway, with mirror imgages and sometimes annoy-o-tron being able to stop your early momentum, and just in general really efficient removal"
hearthstone,3dwfi8,ZerexTheCool,4,Mon Jul 20 13:09:47 2015 UTC,"He is freeze mage. The point of the deck is to live long enough to use all of your burn cards on his face. It means it is tricky to decide exactly what to keep in hand, and what to play for free. If it was mech mage, you would probably be right."
hearthstone,3dwfi8,WingerSupreme,2,Mon Jul 20 13:55:32 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point of mana efficiency.  The Fireball is going to cost the same on Turn 6 as it is on Turn 10, so yeah you can save it for removing a threat as opposed to going face.  Also you might end up playing Alex or something else that renders that earlier damage moot.    When you're playing it for free, that's entirely different.  Play that shit."
hearthstone,3dwfi8,empathogen75,2,Mon Jul 20 13:20:54 2015 UTC,"Good players will just flame cannon for free and play a creature, I think.

Because he can ping for 6 turns to win? He can do that without milhouse. You can frostbolt icelance ping turn 5, fireball ping turn 6.  Because he wouldn't be able to flamestrike otherwise?  Youre pinging a face with an empty hand for 6 turns. Either you ping a minion or use those wasted spells on a minion, or you die within 6 turns of essentially being afk as far as the board is concerned."

I just had a game of my own against a Patron Warrior and I got Emperor down on Turn 6 after a Turn 5 Doomsayer Nova clear and he couldn't answer it for 3(!!!) turns.  Turn 8 I pyroblast face for the hell of it.  Emperor swung in and took care of all the armor so hes at 19 now.  Turn 9 is Malygos, Frostbolt, Icelance both his minions to show I had it, 1 mana Fireball for lethal.  Fatiguing them is usually the better strategy.  I never had Emperor not absorb an Execute before."
hearthstone,3dwfi8,drswnemo,2,Mon Jul 20 05:43:02 2015 UTC,I've always found patron to be a fairly easy matchup for freeze. I think the decks I do worst against are eboladin and mech shaman.
hearthstone,3dwfi8,Victorvonbass,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:33:30 2015 UTC,"Most Patrons don't play it properly.  They should have the advantage as they can switch to maximum armor gain and just armor up every turn to get out of lethal range.  They can still apply pressure, but I just find so many of them misplaying and trying to combo away and go all in with early plays like t3 frothing or t5 patron.  It definitely isn't one of our worst matchups though, I agree to that.  Control Warrior is the worst matchup.  I would put Druid 2nd.  Aggro is usually capable of being handled as long as they don't get the nut draws."

hearthstone,3dwfi8,Lootman,2,Mon Jul 20 13:36:32 2015 UTC,"He can win in 6 turns anyway though? Because you can fireball ping turn 6, and icelance ping turn 5. All blowing those spells early did was make it so if there's too many minions by turn 6 hes blown his spells and can't recover off anything except top decks.  If the board gets flooded by turn 6 in either case, and he needs his spells to clear, that means he reaches turn 7. In this scenario he flamstriked a mana wyrm and a milhouse. Is that really what you call not a misplay when you have two doomsayers in hand you can drop together or draw a frost Nova and clear and save the flamestrike?"

Also, this photo says the packs were opened at 4 in the afternoon.  Your title makes it seem like you opened it just now in the morning.  Still, congrats on your cards."
hearthstone,3e2u43,Lywodox,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:44 2015 UTC,Sherlock here

hearthstone,3dyplz,Miggle1,27,Mon Jul 20 16:49:00 2015 UTC,i would like to see this two cardbacks for the august season.  edit: it turns out that Jomaro Kindred (the author) is now working as a Concept Artist on the Hearthstone team. totally deserved :D
hearthstone,3dyplz,uglyasablasphemy,2,Mon Jul 20 20:21:51 2015 UTC,All the cardbacks have to have the hearthstone symbol in the center though.
hearthstone,3dyplz,ItsZant,2,Tue Jul 21 06:47:44 2015 UTC,Possibly all the more reasons to tune in to Wednesday special announcement. If it is argent tournament then this card back would be the most suited for either when the expansion launches for that month or august.

hearthstone,3e30ij,mylifemyworld17,2,Tue Jul 21 15:57:56 2015 UTC,Don't forget oil rogue. There's a reason most decks run a southsea deckhand.
hearthstone,3e30ij,trojandonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"Woah dude, not true. BGH didn't make handlock unplayable."
hearthstone,3e30ij,mylifemyworld17,0,Tue Jul 21 16:14:39 2015 UTC,BGH doesn't invalidate their entire deck like this card does.
hearthstone,3e30ij,mylifemyworld17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:02 2015 UTC,"It kills their win condition, this card simply sets these decks back a turn."
hearthstone,3e30ij,SorteKanin,0,Tue Jul 21 16:19:21 2015 UTC,"A turn? Not at all. Cards with Charge often don't live long, because they have little health. There's a huge difference between Wolfrider having charge and Wolfrider not having charge. You're missing the point. You can only run 2 BGH in a deck, and Handlock runs 4 giants. If you're using that comparison, that's 2 more win conditions than BGH. However, those decks rely entirely upon their charge cards to win them the game. They have little to no other way to win."
hearthstone,3e30ij,Kikjik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:11 2015 UTC,"Okay interesting idea but STEALTH!? That's insane. This thing would completely kill of hunter and patron warrior and a lot of other things.  I agree with you though, I wish there was a more control-oriented meta. Making decks that are currently OP completely unplayable isn't the way to go though."
hearthstone,3e30ij,NotGenericOne,0,Tue Jul 21 16:05:13 2015 UTC,"One card doesn't make a deck unplayable though. This card doesn't do enough to run two, and you might not even draw it, a single card won't ""ruin"" decks. And you think this card would destroy decks, where some other guy thinks it wouldn't be played at all. I think it'd be in between, I think a lot of decks would run one, like BGH. What if it was a 0/5 without stealth? The stealth keeps it on the board to do its job for patron but I can see how it was be ridiculously sticky against face Hunter. But against face Hunter you would only get to draw a third of your deck before you lose so there's no guarantee you would even get it in time."
