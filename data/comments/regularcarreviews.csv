I guess it makes sense either way you do it - you can think of ""oh, interior controls should be the same regardless of what side they're on"", or you can think ""of course they'd be opposite; LHD cars have the indicator on the outboard side, so of course RHD would do the same and be mirrored.""  It probably just comes down to British automakers working more closely with American and European manufacturers - and being sold alongside them - which creates a pressure for consistency, especially in models that are sold in both configurations."

Edit: And about the British automakers thing... Yeah...

I'm not ultra familiar with the filing stuff for YouTube and I know they change the rules(especially with whatever country you're in) but I know there are a bunch of people out there who've gotten to the threshold where you can collect money off hosting someone else's videos.  Sometimes these videos could be the first one to show instead of the original account due to regionalized weirdness of YouTube where videos in particular areas will be first to come up before the more viewed original video. I remember reading an article about this way back when a lot of the earliest meme viral videos were fads/in full swing and a lot of people in parts of Asia would rip and repost the video to collect views instead of the original video being first to appear. Again I'm super fuzzy on current YouTube regulations but I remember this being a thing that's been exploited.

regularcarreviews,3d4jnn,Xan_the_man,6,Mon Jul 13 14:51:03 2015 UTC,"As far as the Harley Davidson conversation goes, I forever find myself ending up at what George Carlin said in his one bit:   Harley Davidson used to mean something. It stood for biker attitude; grimy outlaws in their sweaty mamas full of beer and crank, rolling around on Harleys, looking for a good time – destroying property, raping teenagers, and killing policemen... all very necessary activities by the way.  But now? Theme restaurants and this soft shit obviously didn’t come from hardcore bikers; it came from these weekend motorcyclists, these fraudulent two-day-a-week motherfuckers who have their bikes trucked into Sturgis, South Dakota for the big rally and then ride around like they just came in off the road. Dentists and bureaucrats and pussy-boy software designers getting up on a Harley cause they think it makes them cool. Well hey skeezics, you ain’t cool, you’re fucking chilli and chilli ain’t never been cool.    Despite all this obviously I don't think everyone on a newer Harley equates to hedgefund manager douchebag or that everyone on a Harley should be a shit heel biker with blood on his shirt to restore the brand name.  As  Mr. Regular sorta alludes to, there's a pretty strong attitude of people out there who roughly think ""oh if you want this kind of bike, you should go with a nice reliable Harley, best bikes I ever had, proud tradition, fuck that foreign crap <scratches crotch under beer gut with his Proud To Be American Cabela's camo shirt> <insert lines from Star Spangled Banner and Hank Hill quotes>, etc, and fail to address how nowadays  Harleys require quite a bit of change to own in comparison to other bikes, especially when buying new and recently used.   Carlin's backhanded assessment of how a number of people on Harleys have money and tend to be casual bikers just buying for brand does have some truth in it.  Idk, out of all the circle jerks out there, I just hate the people who snub their noses at people who prefer other brands of motorcycles wanting nothing to do with the Harley Davidson name and some of the baggage that comes with it."

He could no longer do his work as an outsider, but rather, he was swarmed by fans and followers at each place he set foot.

Note that even after the typical construction moved to bucket seats with a center console and hand-activated parking brake, we still refer to it as an ""emergency brake"" and not a handbrake like Europeans. I would argue that this is because it pretty much every big American car since the mid-'50s has had an automatic transmission with a Park setting, so the parking brake is seen as supplemental rather than necessary like on a manual transmission."

Longer shorter version:   Basically, most of the largest mods have gotten fed up with the way the admins and people in charge of reddit have been running the site. They are frustrated with the lack of tools, attention to complaints, and poor communication. A lot of them blame the interim CEO Pao and her subordinates for this.    The final straw was letting go of someone who basically ran /r/IAMA sub. It caught the mods by surprise, which completely messed up their AMA process for the celebrities who had AMAs coming up, and they went private trying to figure out how to salvage the mess of a sub they had on their hands.   A bunch of shit went down in other subs because of this because of all the frustrations they had, then they also went dark as a sign of protest. The reddit admins are freaking out now because of how many default subs went private, and now they're trying to work out a deal of some sort.   Now, i'm just a humble country mod, but from what I have seen the mods of bigger subs have legit complaints that have been ignored until now. So I am hoping this spurs the reddit admins and employees to DO something constructive about it, and not just ban innocent subs like /r/whalewatchers.   Edit 2: holy shit look at this list of subs with 5k+ users going down  https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bxjyu/list_of_subreddits_suddenly_going_private/"

regularcarreviews,3byrge,Srtviper,2,Fri Jul 3 12:14:10 2015 UTC,I doubt this sub generates additional views for the show.  I would imagine that most people subscribed here would watch the videos whether they show up on there front page or not.  I would be more concerned with weather or not /r/cars is shutting down. The more casual RCR viewer's may not bother seeking RCR if it doesn't show up on there front page.
regularcarreviews,3byrge,jaywallace1,3,Fri Jul 3 11:17:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my hope is that one day the RCR sub will be used more for RCR than /r/cars, but I'm sure that would take a while."
regularcarreviews,3byrge,spahghetti,3,Fri Jul 3 11:29:41 2015 UTC,"The way I see it is, /r/cars is to bring in the casual viewers while /r/regularcarreviews is for community discussion especially on the non-review videos."

regularcarreviews,3byrge,jaywallace1,2,Fri Jul 3 13:54:40 2015 UTC,I am hoping the same in general.  This sub and /Freefolk (a rebellious sub that sprang up over Game Of Thrones subs) are kind of my favorite subs at the moment.  oh and /nba cuz they just don't give a shit.
regularcarreviews,3byrge,audentis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:55:06 2015 UTC,There's always YouTube comments!          Please don't hit me.
regularcarreviews,3byrge,audentis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:18:44 2015 UTC,"...I won't hit you, but YouTube comments sections are not really built for discussion like Reddit. You just can't moderate or navigate comments as easily or as discretely as you can on Reddit, and there are instances where a separate thread unrelated to videos are necessary, such as ""house-cleaning"" meta-threads or announcements like the mention of Mr. R's twitch stream a couple days ago.   And then there's the general trolling of YouTube comment sections; I can speak on behalf of the other mods that no one wants to moderate a YouTube comment section. I have a YouTube channel, I shut off comments on my most popular video years ago because I got tired of weeding out the bullshit comments on it. So the closest thing I can think of where a community of RCR fans could congregate that works similarly to Reddit would be an old-fashion forum."

But if you're planning on doing a tesla, make sure to do it in a really hilly city (Seattle or SF). Rocketing up steep hills in the Model S is way too much fun.  Edit: on going from Portland to LA, don't do it. I've done Seattle to SF many times on family road trips in one day, and it's hellish. Seattle to SF is 14 hours one way, and my family has to wake up at 5am to get there by 7. Portland to LA is 19 hours, and that's not counting traffic.   I-5 is pretty in the Northwest when you're going through the mountains, but in California you're just travelling through plains and desert on a crowded freeway. Don't do it, just fly back."

My family lives in a nice part of town, but the whole town isn't nice.  The borders, however, are crystal clear.  I could draw a line on a map of this town and say ""This is where the money ends.""  On one side of that line, an 7-year old Civic would be admired by your neighbors, and a 2-story house on a modest plot is the norm.  Cross that line, and a much bigger 2-story on a 3 acre plot suddenly becomes a bit small.  That old Civic is suitable only for the child of the homeowners.  On one side of that line, you see the same cars you'd see in any comparable city in the country.  On the other side, 6-figure price tags are still rare on cars, but they happen.

Johnson in response to tariffs placed by France and West Germany on importation of U.S. chicken.""  America was flooding the market with cheap American chicken in Western Europe. They wanted to protect domestic chicken farmers, so the two countries imposed a tariff on imported chicken from the US.  In a hissy-fit fuck-you-assholes response, LBJ imposed the above taxation on those imports.   Why? Weird tariff laws. ""Officially, the tax targeted items imported from Europe approximating the value of lost American chicken sales to Europe."" He was also appealing to the UAW, who were worried about Volkswagen's increasing shipments of vans and light trucks.  Potato starch, dextrin, and brandy are no longer subject to this taxation, but light trucks still are. Which is why the Subaru BRAT came with jumpseats, and these captured import trucks came to be.  Also why Ford wastes money putting seats and windows in their Transit Connect vans built in Turkey, only to strip and destroy the seats and windows after they arrive stateside.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_tax"
regularcarreviews,3a91kb,Celestion321,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:32:39 2015 UTC,"Chicken tax:       The chicken tax is a 25% tariff on potato starch, dextrin, brandy, and light trucks imposed in 1963 by the United States under President Lyndon B. Johnson in response to tariffs placed by France and West Germany on importation of U.S. chicken.  The period from 1961–1964  of tensions and negotiations surrounding the issue, which took place at the height of Cold War politics, was known as the ""Chicken War"".   Eventually, the tariffs on potato starch, dextrin, and brandy were lifted,  but over the next 48 years the light truck tax ossified, remaining in place to protect U.S. domestic automakers from foreign competition (e.g., from Japan and Thailand).  Though concern remains about its repeal,   a 2003 Cato Institute study called the tariff ""a policy in search of a rationale.""   As an unintended consequence several importers of light trucks have circumvented the tariff via loopholes—including Ford (ostensibly a company the tax was designed to protect), which imports the Transit Connect light trucks as ""passenger vehicles"" to the U.S. from Turkey and immediately strips and shreds portions of their interiors, such as installed rear seats, in a warehouse outside Baltimore.

regularcarreviews,376p12,reverendnathan,3,Mon May 25 19:53:25 2015 UTC,"RCR might be go too easy on Toyotas, or I'm too cynical. The Camry before this was gutless, uninspired, and mushy. Well done on Toyota for making a Camry that is still all those things, but also a lot less. Toyota makes up a majority of cars on American roads, so why not inspire good looks? It means statistically, you're more likely to wind up in traffic staring at the ass-end of a Prius, or Camry, or Scion than any other car brand. Given just how many cars of theirs get put out there, why couldn't they make any of them look appealing? We all have to share the road, who the fuck gave Toyota the right to make ugly cars no one else on the road wants to see?!  Maybe I'm nostalgic for a glory day when Toyota made handsome cars with decent powertrains and didn't fuck up sports coupes so bad they literally made a marketing campaign that was hands-are-clean-from-this-disaster that was calling the late-model Celica a car that ""Looks Fast"" instead of admitting it was the slowest thing in the category any way you cut it.  I get that it's got a little trick up it's sleeve that a Camry might appear faster than it's median buying age would expect you to think (by the way that median buying age straight up is fify years old). There is no need to give this base model it's props. It's a tired platform exhausted out to also function as an SUV (RX330), a luxury sedan (LS300), and at one point was a coupe so boring the V6 Accord outsold it in triplicate.  I love regular cars, but I think a softball might have been thrown to this one. The Camry has been a bad car since Nevermind hit the Billboard charts. It's continued legacy of uninspired mundane minutiae should be a shame of all car enthusiasts everywhere, even if it does somehow manage to get a little more tolerable each generation. Even if the Prius, made by the same people, is the new scapegoat of the biased roadrage people felt for Camrys in the 1990's. It's just not a good car, and I think that's still OK to say coming up on thirty years after the fact of the Camry becoming America's no. 1 vehicle."

regularcarreviews,36ddtt,organman91,2,Tue May 19 01:46:44 2015 UTC,I'm from the same area as Mr. Regular and I do this too. College friends corrected me many times but I'll always say it my way.

regularcarreviews,36ddtt,Sajaho,7,Mon May 18 21:20:05 2015 UTC,We'll do it again sometime.
regularcarreviews,36ddtt,RegularCars,6,Tue May 19 01:35:36 2015 UTC,Cool! I have an 05 in the same color. Glad that Mr. R compared it to an E30. It's definitely both fun and practical.
regularcarreviews,36ddtt,CooperRHall,5,Mon May 18 14:55:50 2015 UTC,Has anyone else tried playing Turok recently?  It is not the same game I remember it being.
regularcarreviews,36ddtt,Srtviper,5,Tue May 19 00:14:14 2015 UTC,"I tried to play Turok 2: Seeds of Evil not very long ago, and man, even the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia couldn't make that game enjoyable. 90's console shooters have not aged well."
regularcarreviews,36ddtt,pyfrag,2,Tue May 19 00:47:12 2015 UTC,The controls for FPS's have become so standardized now that the really early console titles (especially on the N64) are almost impossible to get into now a days.
regularcarreviews,36ddtt,Srtviper,1 point,Tue May 19 00:55:11 2015 UTC,"That game is hard as hell to play now.  It was difficult then, but trying to apply modern FPS muscle memory to old Turok games is an exercise in futility."
regularcarreviews,36ddtt,typedefz,4,Fri May 22 18:12:01 2015 UTC,I want one too.  Almost bought an '07 then didn't.....and I regret it.
regularcarreviews,36ddtt,korgothwashere,2,Mon May 18 18:08:07 2015 UTC,"I test drove a few 06-07 RS's and Saab 92x's before finding my 2010 2.5i and I have to say that gen of Impreza feels great. The visibility in the newer ones isn't as good and they have to lug an extra 200 lbs of safety crap, but still loads of fun in the snow haven't gotten stuck in any storm New England has thrown at me yet.    Wonder why mr. R  didn't mention interior quality though"

regularcarreviews,35kx3t,517634,14,Mon May 11 09:56:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna lie, it was definitely a refreshing take on the New York Auto show.  It's different from the usual meat/humor I'm used to, but it works really well.  Lots of new catch-phrases to further confuse my friends.  Also, it takes talent to compare their limited time at the auto show and the purpose of their press badge with the reservoir tip of a condom.  I'm never looking at Mike and Ike candy the same way again.  ... Danger Zone!"
regularcarreviews,35kx3t,captainyuhyuh,10,Mon May 11 11:16:57 2015 UTC,It was also nice to get a perspective on The Roman's writing style. I had no idea he shared a similar dirty sense of humor not unlike Mr. Regular. It's not the same as the Meat joke but like the Mike and Ike Condom Tip comment isn't something you'd get in a normal review.
regularcarreviews,35kx3t,zopiac,12,Mon May 11 11:23:26 2015 UTC,"""Oozing ... like pus from the spot that Krystal Tickletaint put her mouth on the night before.""  Well I for one can't wait for the next Roman video."
regularcarreviews,35kx3t,nicothecat,9,Mon May 11 10:58:30 2015 UTC,"With the duo doing two prospective types of videos it makes me think of this.  I started going to a restaurant a little after they started up. There was these two chefs who just made steak. Real good meat.  The meat has a lot of fat in it. Sometimes it made you a little sick but you loved it anyway. turns out that one of the chefs took the reins and started making the steaks a little different. A little healthier, a little less fat in the meat. but it was still good. The other chef assisted him. Putting his own garnishing and flavorings to the mix.  Time passed and finally the second chef has his own dish. And it's just as delicious as the other. It's a different taste, but my God is it amazing.  /u/regularcars and /u/regularroman. Thank you for the double helping of meat."
regularcarreviews,35kx3t,Szos,4,Mon May 11 13:04:10 2015 UTC,"Roman should do less singing and more of these kinds of videos.  I like the behind-the-scenes perspective on shows, maybe because I used to work in that industry."
regularcarreviews,35kx3t,YepImanEmokid,5,Mon May 11 11:49:24 2015 UTC,"Roman comin' in with a shotgun blast of references and quotable moments, what a strong commentary. I'm looking forward to hearing more :)"

regularcarreviews,35kx2k,Zaziel,6,Mon May 11 16:50:13 2015 UTC,Oh my god. That awkward chat in the Lexus was brutal. Delicious.   This whole video was probably too real for the NYIAS people.
regularcarreviews,35kx2k,martinw89,5,Mon May 11 22:41:00 2015 UTC,"So can we safely assume that Freddie Wong podcast with RCR is lost to history, never to be recovered again?"
regularcarreviews,35kx2k,Xarvas,3,Mon May 11 11:57:19 2015 UTC,Does Freddie Wong still do podcasts? Does Freddie Wong do anything anymore with  YouTube?
regularcarreviews,35kx2k,nicothecat,4,Mon May 11 13:05:31 2015 UTC,"At first when I started watching the channel I was waiting anxiously for Mr.Regular's big reveal, now, honestly, I really don't want to see him. I like that he stays faceless to maintain the integrity of his content and I have a lot of respect for that. A great video, and Roman's was awesome too (and his voice is strangely ASMR-inducing..weird). Hopefully you can come out to Cali sometime."

It's just a car that's in between everything.  It's a pretty good truck and I like it's small size since y'know I was an electrician, but I'll be damned if I could ever figure out what it was for."
regularcarreviews,357s9h,buy_a_pork_bun,1 point,Sun May 10 22:41:06 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're going to state something like that, you might want to justify / explain that statement.

regularcarreviews,351edv,RegularCars,19,Wed May 6 15:03:18 2015 UTC,"This.  When you are stuck in a hotel room with beer and no bottle opener, you need to use what you have on hand. Benjamen Franklin said ""Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy.""   I am Protestant, which means I an free to interpret the scriptures. In this case, Philippians 4:19  ""But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.""  This is the verse that is often reduced to ""God will provide."" Here is your proof. In our thirsty hour of need, God provided the means to imbibe drink of barley and hopps."

regularcarreviews,34t8mz,ExplosionSanta,5,Mon May 4 12:02:37 2015 UTC,I don't get please to explain?
regularcarreviews,34t8mz,Dick_Jerkinton,8,Mon May 4 22:03:04 2015 UTC,He doesn't take care of it because he won't need it because he won't get married because existing solely to provide for another person and x little ones isn't appealing to him. (He's married though)   He related this metaphor to something about the car which I forget.   Edit: Thanks /u/ExplosionSanta. He was comparing his scrotum to the frunk.

regularcarreviews,34t8mz,sky4,3,Tue May 5 03:04:48 2015 UTC,That review was done in character as Harold Slovinski. Anything Mr Slovinski says about himself can be safely assumed to be untrue about Mr Regular.
regularcarreviews,34t8mz,ExplosionSanta,2,Tue May 5 05:31:47 2015 UTC,The frunk.
regularcarreviews,34t8mz,ExplosionSanta,11,Tue May 5 03:02:59 2015 UTC,The car of dreams. I wanted some.commentary on the pop up headlights but this was a fantastic review nonetheless. And the sound! Oh the sound!  You can probably pick one up for $35k om decent condition nowadays.
regularcarreviews,34t8mz,buy_a_pork_bun,7,Mon May 4 11:46:09 2015 UTC,"Indeed! At price ranges under that, they are slightly more mutilated, with the salvage ones bottoming around $22k."
regularcarreviews,34t8mz,Varryl,5,Mon May 4 16:23:46 2015 UTC,"The only reason you would avoid the salvage title would be fear of the aluminum body being knackered. But if the frame is good, it might be worth your while.  This isn't a cheap car.to buy though since its MSRP was $95k and it hasn't really depreciated.  Which makes you think and maybe realize that there might be cheaper alternatives. But god this car is awesome."
regularcarreviews,34t8mz,buy_a_pork_bun,1 point,Mon May 4 20:47:44 2015 UTC,"Doubt it. NSXs have always kept their value well. R34 GTRs go for ~$50k CAD while good NSXs (late model, meticulously serviced) examples go for well over $80k CAD."
regularcarreviews,34t8mz,jaaagman,1 point,Wed May 6 05:23:07 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about eaaaarly NSXs. It won't be totally meticulously serviced, but the fact that a 20 year old car can go for as much 7 NA miatas is insane."
regularcarreviews,34t8mz,buy_a_pork_bun,1 point,Wed May 6 05:40:15 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see ""NA miata"" start to be used as a metric, similar to how the height of the empire state building is."
regularcarreviews,34t8mz,Fellidae,6,Fri May 29 19:48:27 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the point of the car. It's a visceral, direct, analog experience. It's a pure driving car, much like the miata or the toyobaru  twins.  HP doesn't always factor into that. Mods detract from that experience. If you want that, plenty of LS small block cars at that price."
regularcarreviews,34t8mz,Varryl,3,Mon May 4 17:14:45 2015 UTC,"Well so does a Corvette, and you can have your HP that way. What a Corvette ISN'T is a mid engine purist driving experience."
regularcarreviews,34t8mz,Varryl,3,Mon May 4 17:44:00 2015 UTC,"I think you're misunderstanding me. You can buy cheaper faster cars, but if you haven't driven an NSX (and I have) it does one thing well. It's an intimate connection to the road . If you don't want that, it's fine. If you DO want that, HP doesn't matter, and there are very few cars that live up to that in that regard.  Edit: did that guy really delete all his comments in the thread? Well, alright."

Also, I think it comes with electric power steering which means no means to build up your triceps as you drive, and less communicative with the road.  They still look nice, but they're not my cup of tea."

regularcarreviews,34cueo,nicothecat,25,Thu Apr 30 03:05:54 2015 UTC,"Give me more MEAT. But really though, I love everything about RCR. However, recently they seem to be getting somewhat away from their roots. Rather than discussing ""the spirit"" of the car and the kind of person who drives it, they seem to be focusing on the car itself which makes RCR like every other car show on YouTube. What makes it special is the MEAT, the vulgarity, and the philosophical lecture behind the reason for a car's being."
regularcarreviews,34cueo,leadfoot323,10,Thu Apr 30 05:58:29 2015 UTC,I figure that Mr. Regular compulsively needs to make poop jokes. I don't think the roots are ever really going away.
regularcarreviews,34cueo,Varryl,4,Thu Apr 30 15:38:42 2015 UTC,Yeah he really seems to have toned it down since the backlash from the 04 Civic SI. I miss it and often quote it while driving  around.
regularcarreviews,34cueo,screech_owl_kachina,16,Thu Apr 30 23:38:12 2015 UTC,More Meat? I can do that.
regularcarreviews,34cueo,RegularCars,10,Sat May 2 13:39:15 2015 UTC,Please do.  I've been compensating for the lack of meat by punctuating the end of sentences with the voice and making analogies that would make Dave Attell proud.  ... more meat
regularcarreviews,34cueo,captainyuhyuh,16,Sun May 3 05:26:02 2015 UTC,"I love the philosophical meanderings about the existential status of car you're reviewing. It's a wonderful departure from the focus on numbers and figures. Not that they're unimportant, but RCR when it does it, really does hammer home (rather fantastically I'll say) the social commentary as well as some good automotive history.  Seriously, the Lee Iaccoca history lesson was fantastic and the joyful musings of the Grand National and the MR2 reviews was massively enjoyable.  I'll be honest, I do wish there was more variety and maybe a bit more off kilter weirdness from the early days. The problem I guess is balancing that with a more professional review, which is a shame. But there's probably a good balance. Like the AE86 review which had a very nice balance of furious ranting and off kilter jokes and serious information (although some of it is a bit incorrect now..).   I guess what I'll say is that keep doing pieces that focus on the existential parts of the car. Why it exists and it continues to exist (for reasons that we agree with or otherwise) or ceases to exist combined with Regular's dulcet tones and almost meandering conversational style will keep me coming back aaaaaallll the time."
regularcarreviews,34cueo,buy_a_pork_bun,14,Thu Apr 30 14:28:09 2015 UTC,"I enjoy a balance, and a variety.  I love seeing all the different sides of Mr. Regular. The sheer joy in the GN or MR2 reviews, the hatred he has for the Jetta (I also liked that he included the Roman's take on it), and his respect for the dedication of Corvette owners.  As much as THE MEAT initially resulted in a WTF reaction, it didn't bother me badly enough to drive (ha) me off, and now I look forward to some of it occasionally. Mr. Regular wouldn't be the same without it.  Most of all though, I love to hear the deconstruction of the kind of person who drives the car he's reviewing, or the history behind the making of the car, or how it affects the owner or people's perceptions of the owner. This pervades all but the really early reviews, and is really why I keep coming back.  Just for shits, here's a list of reviews I've watched more than once:   GN Miata NA AE86 SVX Challenger XJ6 Fiesta ST Ferrari SW20 Hayabusa V8 Vantage 4Runner Dodge Aspen E30 Focus ST Jetta Delorean Dodge Ram And of course, the original Miata   You know, after writing this out, I think I might have a problem be a bit obsessed with RCR...  Oh, and props to the Roman for consistently killing it, even when Mr. Regular isn't (not that I don't like Harold Slovinski, but he can't do the entire review)."

I like that you make the videos funny by using stereotypes but its a bit light on the facts.  I didn't like your review of the Prius. You missed the point of the car entirely. It's a practical family car that gets really good gas mileage. Its supposed to be safe, practical, comfortable and efficient. This obviously makes it slow and boring. But nobody buys it to drive up mountain roads on the weekends (OK maybe me).   If you get a chance to review a second gen, look at it from the point of view of someone living in the city where it can sit in traffic with the ac going and the engine off on a long commute."

Yes he bags on the fact that in relative terms, it's not that efficient, comfortable, practical, or safe (blind spots!).

regularcarreviews,341ee4,RegularCars,4,Mon Apr 27 22:54:40 2015 UTC,"me?? I love the reviews exactly the way they are. To be honest that's why I replied to /u/BoxSpringGuy when he said: ""These videos are becoming less and less entertaining"". I don't always watch the videos because I seek entertainment, I watch them because they tend to be on point (or is it in point? English is not my first language) and they are sometimes surprising and revealing to the point of epiphany. I've spent thousands of hours reading novels so I also really like the moments in the videos when your major in English surfaces. I really do, and I think what you do is in the end a great service to anyone who is thinking of buying a car, because they won't find that kind of review anywhere else on the internet. So I say you should keep making videos that may not always be entertaining, because sometimes they just have to be informative or just plain crazy and completely biased and personal. They are your videos, and that is just fine."
regularcarreviews,341ee4,nombre_usuario,2,Tue Apr 28 03:48:15 2015 UTC,"The way I consider it it seems like you have two kinds of reviews, totally off the wall insane (avenger) or a unique introspection to a car. I like it that way though, both are pretty unique to you and this channel,  and it seems like I have a bit of a dissenting opinion but you need both kinds of review, too many of either kind over saturates and takes away the fun of both, its kind of how you can only watch a couple ""how to basic"" videos without it just seeming way too much. Keep on doing what you're doing."

Not to overthink or get overly meta with the RCR realm and entity, but that'd be pretty damn clever to represent communally agreed sentiments of it by the nature of the review. At least that's how I saw it, an average review for an average sort of car.  I mean what the fuck else could be said about this car that would make it super interesting to talk about that wouldn't sound like a flashy bow tie car salesman?  For me personally, I find the newer Civic SIs completely boring and overly generic, especially the 4 door which just basically looks like any other car. Kinda shitty since SIs tend to be quite stand out in the past. It's almost paradoxical, the SI name alone carried a lot of different imagery and ideas but this new product looks sorta distant from those initial thoughts that come to mind."
regularcarreviews,341ee4,AgentUmlaut,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:29:19 2015 UTC,"I usually like it when you talk about the history, anecdotes and social context surrounding the car.

For instance, my favourite reviews you've done are the Toyota FJ Cruiser and the Mazda Miata NA, since they really go into depth about the social context surrounding the car.  The silly jokes are nice, though. I will sometimes say them out loud around people I know and confuse the hell out of them. I also have a tendency to start repeatedly yelling ""BUSINESS ACCOUNTS!"" in the Harold Slavinsky voice when stuck behind a Honda Accord going under the speed limit for no good reason.

regularcarreviews,337po1,Doctor_Squared,2,Wed Apr 22 01:00:20 2015 UTC,"I'm still using my 92' Pickup. Because of it's incredibly light body frame, the auto box works and the power steering and AC surprisingly work.   That said, the suspension is pretty terrible, the insulation was awful until I got it fixed and the brakes are frankly dangerous. But I love that thing. It refuses to die and it's just happy being driven."
regularcarreviews,337po1,buy_a_pork_bun,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:39:37 2015 UTC,"hey! I know almost nothing about cars and learned to drive on january 2014, being 26 years old, which is not that crazy in my country but whatever: I got late in the game and I've been learning stuff about cars for 2 years now; still haven't lost the interest one bit. And I really like your channel for those and for other reasons.  Anyway I have a (totaly unrelated to this thread) question I wanted to make, just in case you have something to say about it: I heard you say in one of your videos (at least I could swear I did) that european cars are meant to be driven at high revs. 2 years ago when I knew absolutely zero abour cars I purchased a 1982 BMW E21, (manual, carburated, 2 liter L6 engine, really fucking old but I love it) and since I heard you say that, I've somewhat lost the 'fear' of making the engine go beyond 3500 RPMs, and I've actually felt the car behave a little less like a 80 year old man trying to run a marathon next to professional athletes when I'm on the road. So, that's my question: is it really safe to make an (ooooold) engine go beyond 3500? is it actually smart to go to 4000 and beyond before going to 2nd and then to 3rd gear, so I can have at least a glimpse of acceleration?"
regularcarreviews,337po1,nombre_usuario,2,Thu Apr 23 04:37:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for liking RCR. I don't really know how to answer that question with a ""yes or no"".  No, European cars aren't rev-exceptional in any way.  Yes, it is safe to make the engine rev high IF it is well maintained. No, don't take the engine to redline and hold it there forever. Yes, you can take it beyond 3,500. No, don't make the engine sit at high revs on the highway. No, I never said European cars are made to be driven at high revs."
regularcarreviews,337po1,RegularCars,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:25:53 2015 UTC,"oh well, I've surely never taken the engine to redline. When it comes to driving 'timid' is a word that describes me. 'Coward' also works. I just felt like it was going to explode after passing the 3500 mark. Hey thank you for the answer and I hope you keep it up with the videos, my country doesn't have that much diversity when it comes to cars so it's awesome to know weird models next to the familiar ones. Cheers"

regularcarreviews,32f6i1,nicothecat,3,Mon Apr 13 11:22:01 2015 UTC,"The opening song for a '99 Insight should be a Roman version of ""We Didn't Start the Fire""  It's got the gas engine from a kei car, a gauge cluster from a Honda Helix scooter, is truly a lightweight car, and beat the Prius to market by seven months.  But because it was a two door hatch that was built more as an engineering exercise it got beaten in the market by the more practical, boring Prius. By the time the second gen Insight launched in 2009 it lost all of its charm and became a crappy knockoff Prius."

A pallid suetfaced young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin. New set of microbes. A man with an infant's saucestained napkin tucked round him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet. A man spitting back on his plate: halfmasticated gristle: no teeth to chewchewchew it. Chump chop from the grill. Bolting to get it over. Sad booser's eyes. Bitten off more than he can chew. Am I like that? See ourselves as others see us. Hungry man is an angry man. Working tooth and jaw. Don't! O! A bone! That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the schoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne. Wonder what he was eating. Something galoptious.

Not to go into a whole discussion of deserving things and worth, but I think it's at least fair to say your efforts have put you in a spot where someone wouldn't be so quick to say ""who the fuck does this guy think he is and why is he so special?"".   Not trying to say you're on some invincible level where you'll be first in line at VIP coke parties but I kinda see you(and the show) in a realm of creators who can sorta stand on their work with some pride, proving quite a deal of legitimacy and originality. Obviously there's something to be said and shown when talking about the show.   I think it also helps how you guys seem like  well regular kind of people, those random drives, the radio interview and chatter videos really show that and it's nice to seem something a bit unscripted.   I say that in comparison to a lot of heavy handed web personality who never really act human and just are in some over the top character the entire time. I mean you gotta have a gimmick to make things happen, but sometimes you don't wanna have something crammed down your throat at full blast for every single video. You guys have perfect balance.   In short you guys don't seem like superficial blowhard assholes. I'd be more willing to help someone who's at least shows they're a person than some maniac who only makes obscenity and homophobic slur ladened minecraft gameplay videos.   The writing and delivery of a lot of things makes the show really stand out. There's a lot of appeal to be had whether you're in it for the informative stuff, humor, or overall critique. As someone who's a fan of well crafted writing in general, it's greatly welcomed when I hear well thought out ways of explaining a particular thing. The interjections of the crude sorta vulgar moments in between those kinds of things really adds for a laugh factor.

To me the styling is actually kind of good.  If it was just a little lighter, I think the Juke could make a sold competitor for more traditional hatchbacks."

It was Holden's version of GM's J-body family of cars — GM's third ""global"" car platform. The name ""Camira"" comes from an Aboriginal word meaning ""wind.""  After an initial good sales run, Camira sales dropped significantly and the model was discontinued in 1989. The Holden Apollo, a rebadged Toyota Camry was introduced as the Australian market replacement, with New Zealand instead offering the European-sourced Opel Vectra. In all 151,807 Camiras were built (85,725 JBs; 36,953 JDs; and 29,129 JEs).

A while back I started making revews for various products that I have. I was trying to make them as profesional as possible with my limited equipment. However I just wasnt enjoying myself. At the same time I was just starting to follow RCR and I thought it might be fun to make a review similar to what RCR does. I did just that, if one of you people want to critique it please do. I do not want to rip off Mr Regular, and as I continue to create content I will actively look for ways to distance myself from what he does, while sticking with parody reviews.

regularcarreviews,2yozju,IronBagel,3,Fri Mar 13 18:00:20 2015 UTC,"I gave it a watch and I see the influence that that RCR has on your delivery. I also gave your other reviews a watch to see how they were done.   I was caught a little off guard by the horns though, my ears are still ringing from that lol. TBH I liked how you did your older reviews. A Homemade steady cam and practice is all I feel it needs. Get to know your camera and editing software. Keep at it and be yourself. Also be consistent on your uploads. You got potential but don't let it turn into wasted energy( most influential quote from Mr.Regular). Cheers"

Along with the horns in the Snowball review, I also think you did ""the voice"" too often.  I laughed at the comparison of the average snowball users vs drivers of Buicks though.  I do think you have potential though, especially if you make the reviews informative, but throw in some comedy."
regularcarreviews,2yozju,Xarvas,3,Mon Mar 16 08:48:54 2015 UTC,"Yo, I checked it out too, and I chuckled and was entertained for the most part. Like others have said, the horns do sound very separate to the rest of the video, but maybe just reducing the volume and changing the timing and repetition on them might do the trick.  Overall I think you have a lot of potential and I can definitely see where you intend your videos to go."
regularcarreviews,2ym0lj,nicothecat,5,Tue Mar 10 22:27:56 2015 UTC,I'm guessing maybe there's finally a mustang that he likes?
regularcarreviews,2ym0lj,Dodge_Viper2015,6,Wed Mar 11 00:47:24 2015 UTC,I was not expecting a second POV from two cars we haven't seen reviews for yet in one day.  It makes me wonder if these cars will get a review or if they are just stand alone POVs with no review to accompany them.  Possibly for cars that RCR has already (sort of) reviewed?
regularcarreviews,2ym0lj,Srtviper,16,Wed Mar 11 00:49:44 2015 UTC,"Those two cars (Rav4 and Mustang Turbo) were not filmed with intention to turn them into full RCR Episodes.   I have months of footage filmed. Hell, I have car footage from last October that has not aired yet because I am so back-logged. I'm not complain, don't get me wrong. It's great.   I've stopped scheduling film shoots because there's no way I could get though all these cars (1st world problems).   All the while, I get about ten car-offers a day. I have to do SOMETHING, espically when I'm in a new town for a weekend and excited fans want to hang out. Sometimes people press car keys into my hand.   ""Please drive my car!"" #egoboost  I can't just drive their car and NOT film it. I have to do something, so the P.O.V. Drive is my version of The Smoking Tire's ""One Take."" It's a quick video that takes little time to edit and doesn't interfere with RCR's weekly editing schedule of episodes."

regularcarreviews,2ym0lj,Dodge_Viper2015,3,Wed Mar 11 01:26:01 2015 UTC,"That's what I meant by ""Possibly for cars that RCR has already (sort of) reviewed?"".  However both the Rav4 and mustang reviews were from different generation from the cars shown in the POV videos.  Maybe not giving them full reviews is to avoid repetition, although these may be more like teasers for future reviews."
regularcarreviews,2ym0lj,Srtviper,3,Wed Mar 11 01:44:48 2015 UTC,"And well, the rav4 video was pretty bad. So..."
regularcarreviews,2ym0lj,Dodge_Viper2015,3,Wed Mar 11 01:47:09 2015 UTC,Yeah.  It is my second least favorite behind the citi golf.
regularcarreviews,2ym0lj,Srtviper,3,Wed Mar 11 01:58:31 2015 UTC,"I already know I'm going to get made fun of and told ""WHY ARE YOU ON HERE?!"", but I actually found the RAV4 video a bit offensive. I think it's the only one I haven't liked."
regularcarreviews,2ym0lj,Dodge_Viper2015,3,Wed Mar 11 02:55:24 2015 UTC,I wasn't offended.  I just didn't really 'get' it.  I somehow missed the connection between the RAV4 and the Catholic church.
regularcarreviews,2ym0lj,Srtviper,3,Wed Mar 11 03:05:13 2015 UTC,"That's the first time I've ever seen that video...   After I watched it, all I could say is ooookkkkaaay?  Definitely a weird one."
regularcarreviews,2ym0lj,Creep_The_Night,2,Wed Mar 11 03:21:03 2015 UTC,"In the Northeast (Exclusively, I can vouch for this) Priests and other Catholic church members drive toyotas because they are cheap and reliable."
regularcarreviews,2ym0lj,Dodge_Viper2015,2,Wed Mar 11 04:04:38 2015 UTC,"There's a stereotype that (Old) Catholics drive Toyotas in the Northeast. It's usually not true, mainly because they're conservative, so they have to buy 'murican v8s while they complain about both Bush and Obama."

regularcarreviews,2ym0lj,Dodge_Viper2015,2,Wed Mar 11 03:38:05 2015 UTC,"Those are FWD. I quite like the RWD turbo four cylinder. They made these so that they can keep the 5.0, so don't complain."
regularcarreviews,2ym0lj,Dodge_Viper2015,2,Wed Mar 11 04:06:50 2015 UTC,"I did not mean for it to come out as a complaint, just my opinion. The mustang is well known for being a muscle car. By putting a 4banger turbo under the hood it loses its charm. Yes they did have a turbo one in the 80's, hell there was even the McLaren Mustang, i just feel that muscle cars should stay in the 6's and 8's. With Ford phasing out the v8s though I see why they are making the move to a smaller engine. A supercharged or turbo v6 would be fun to see in the later mustangs. Again this is my opinion."
