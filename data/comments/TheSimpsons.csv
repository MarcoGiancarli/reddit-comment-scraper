Each episode of the monthly series featured a regular segment on sniglets, which Hall described as ""any word that doesn't appear in the dictionary, but should"".  Many sniglet collection books were published: each contained a theme, was stylized and organized like a dictionary, and had a quirky title. However, ""Son of Sniglet"" was not one of the books of the series; it is a complete fabrication of the writers."

TheSimpsons,3duxjb,The_Fan,2,Sun Jul 19 23:56:01 2015 UTC,"Hey, I didn't even know that these existed. Who makes them? They're awesome"
TheSimpsons,3duxjb,TinFoilRobotProphet,2,Sun Jul 19 23:45:27 2015 UTC,Neca makes the new ones but I'm not sure if they have always made them.

TheSimpsons,3duxjb,JangoF76,2,Mon Jul 20 02:28:17 2015 UTC,"Which are your favourites?  I always regret not collecting the figures years ago when they were readily available and I had the chance.. I really dislike the newest run of figures so that's putting me off even beginning, only thing I've got is all of the Lego minifigures. I'm forever envious of this collection though, you can even go and visit it if you're in Italy!"

And those mini figures are great! I have both sets and don't have the heart to open them.   Top of my head I would say vampire burns, Kang and Kodos . But I love them all!"
