Colombia,3e4nbx,urrutia86,3,Wed Jul 22 02:42:23 2015 UTC,Have you considered Colombian radio or do you exclusively seek podcasts?
Colombia,3e4nbx,TiburonVolador,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:54:39 2015 UTC,"I want anything that I can download and put on my ipod. Podcasts tend to have a lot of dialog and i can listen to them over and over again, and can pause and rewind if I need to look up a word or try to figure out what is being said.  However, I am open to suggestions about radio stations as well (especially ones I can stream for free over the internet)."
Colombia,3e4nbx,TiburonVolador,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:11:07 2015 UTC,All major radio stations in Colombia have free online streaming. La W Radio and Blu Radio are vocal based and are ok to listen to. Some people might hate their content but when it comes to practice their your best bet.
Colombia,3e4nbx,nombre_usuario,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:31:33 2015 UTC,el Podcast de Diana Uribe que te recomendaron es muy bueno y el acento de ella creo que es lo que se consideraría 'Bogotano' o como comunmente se conoce: 'rolo'.  http://www.caracol.com.co/audio_programas/podcast/la-historia-del-mundo/feed/PROG.aspx/320899>  tomado de: http://www.caracol.com.co/audio_programas/programas/la-historia-del-mundo/programa/320899.aspx

Colombia,3e38pw,hunteram,3,Wed Jul 22 01:23:27 2015 UTC,"Antes de que sigan atacando a la mujer, quiero dar a conocer un poco del contexto general. Los taxistas en cartagena (la gran mayoria) son muy atrevidos manejando, y en esa esquina hay un davivienda y su parqueadero da a un semaforo en la avenida jimenez,  los taxistas y mototaxistas se suben al parqueadero para volarse a los demas vehiculos, convierten la via de un carril en una de dos carriles. El taxista golpeó el taxi de la mujer y se iba a escapar, alguien en una buseta le avisó a la señora de esto, ella se bajó y empezó a reclamarle para que esperara a la policia y que le debía pagar el daño, el empezó los insultos y no quería pagar estos daños, fue ahí cuando el esperó a que ella se ofuscara para empezar a grabar.  Me parece absurdo ahora darle al cuento del racismo, cuando una discusión es algo entre ambos entes y para que esta señora se pusiera así tuvo que haber pasado algo detrás de cámara, además, cojo taxi mínimo 3 veces a la semana acá en Cartagena y de 10 carreras, puedo decir que 2 son decentes, bien hablados y respetan las vías.  soy Cartagenero, soy moreno y parte de mi familia es negra, y simplemente pienso que la señora cayó en el jueguito del taxista que ahora buscará plata y se convertirá en un santo, que nunca ha hecho nada malo en su vida."
Colombia,3e38pw,luisbv23,5,Wed Jul 22 15:13:57 2015 UTC,"la controversia vende. la vieja la embarro al tratar al taxista de negro. si lo madrea y dice que los taxistas son unos hps, todo el mundo la estaria apoyando. pero dijo que eran negros y ahi la cago. hay negros que son muy decentes y otros que son un asco, igual que los blancos. la raza no tiene nada que ver con que la gente sea bien o sean una porqueria."

They get paid by the higher payer to say what they want, they don't investigate, they just accuse, they are awful, journalism in Colombia is only done well by some.   Semana only does a good job when talking about neutral stuff (sports, rights, etc) but not when there's two parties.   Always complaining about how our country is doing bad.. Well why don't you butt heads inform well so we citizens can decide informed!!"

Corruption? Meh. Theft? Meh. Inept politics? Meh.  Life in Colombia is a constant disappointment even with low expectations, so I'd rather be surprised than let down.   The other day I was about to cross a street and a taxi was coming. The bastard actually stopped and asked me to pass. I was speechless. That was a nice day."

Colombia,3e3ibg,Southofsouth,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:42:28 2015 UTC,"I agreed with the part of the article about our reaction about the portrayal of Colombia abroad. Things like the Chilean comedian, the Escobar Netflix TV show, or whatever bullshit that is said about our country. People get so upset about things a foreign person has said but very little about actual shit that is happening in Colombia. This has been a chronical condition for many Colombians that are still very little used to exchange of opinions with foreign people.  Do you guys remember when Letterman made a stupid joke about a beauty pageant and he actually had to apologize and bring the girl on stage again. And some people felt good as if this guy actually gave a shit.  People get upset about the Coca and Narco-culture but still say shit like ""Come to Colombia, our women are very beautiful"". As if this were the largest brother in South America.  And whenever someone makes the tiny joke about the country, everybody decides to put a shitty comic sans meme with the Colombian flag on Facebook bitching about it. But try to have a look about our humor and the way we talk about some foreigners from neighbor countries, or the jokes about the naive gringo. So, either we take it as humor and stop nagging about it or we just stop making these kind of jokes."

You can get a job instantly teaching English.  Just don't expect to be paid much.  You can survive on the pay but you won't really live the best life.
Colombia,3e1ush,kamo75,0,Tue Jul 21 14:27:11 2015 UTC,"so if you intend to go the english teacher route, you must start looking up schools from outside colombia.  These schools tend to pay much, much (think at least double) better for people who apply from outside fo the country."

Colombia,3dqxpp,RCam72,4,Sat Jul 18 18:03:34 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say any type. I either go with queso blanco or Mozzarella. Any cheeses softer would probably dissolve and the harder cheeses usually have a stronger flavor that could throw off the taste of the chocolate.

No se si es solo en Colombia o en la mayoria de Latinoamerica, pero la puntualidad es muy diferente comparada a paises como Canada o Estados Unidos, en donde el tiempo es practicamente sinonimo de dinero. Si pierdes tiempo pierdes dinero."
Colombia,3drojp,bearcam,2,Sat Jul 18 20:22:30 2015 UTC,"Colombia is not geographically suited for viniculture.  It's too close to the equator.  Colombians prefer to drink beer and soft drinks.  Moreover, they are still enthralled by the wonders of technology and industrial food processes.  (Everything that people in Napa hate, in other words.)  ETA:  two beverages of interest to locavores that come from the interior of the country are aguardiente (similar to pastis/ouzo/sambuca/rakı) and chicha, which is basically Andean moonshine.  On the coast you can find rum.  Colombian beer is not terribly good.  Colombians' tastes tend towards the sugary, light and fruity end of things.  Neon colored soft drinks are a favorite.  Good coffee is not all that big.  (you're likely to be served instant.)  Good coffee is, ironically for a country that produces so much of the stuff, an imported European affectation of the bourgeoisie."

There are a few vineyards in certain regions, such as Villa de Leyva but it's kinda meh. In general, most wine in Colombia comes from Chile and Argentina, followed by Spain, USA, Italy, France, etc. Personally I prefer Argentine wine to Chilean, but that's just me. Large supermarkets will have a good variety of wines from different regions."

Algunas son autocríticas, otras son re malas, otras son parodias, otras son comedias, otras son dramas románticos, pero casi todas hablan sobre o referencian las porquerías que los americanos hacen como país, o los defectos famosos de esta ciudad o aquella (el conservatismo y la ingorancia de Texas y el sur, el desórden e inseguridad de Nueva York, los excesos y libertinaje de Los Ángeles, etc).   creo que desde hace tiempo quería desahogarme con lo que sentí cuando la gente empezó a criticar la publicación de narconovelas en Colombia. Sí: es una idiotada idolatrar a los narcos, pero la simple existencia de series y películas no los convierte en héroes. En cambio sí podían ser una herramienta para que Colombia produjera contenido que por primera vez no fuera de interés exclusívamente nacional, y la industria del cine y la TV tuvieran un tema para producir bastante material rentable"

Colombia,3dh9st,HtoTheIzzOcapo,7,Thu Jul 16 15:35:39 2015 UTC,"Yo creo que está bien. Entre más se cuente esta historia, se va a volver más una caricatura del pasado. No es la mejor manera, y mucha gente critica que esto sólo está perpetuando esa imagen de Colombia, pero yo no creo. Este tipo de historias se cuentan generalmente después de que pasan las cosas. Es más, la producción está filmada en Colombia, cosa que no habría podido haberse hecho en los años de Escobar. Leonard Maltin, crítico de cine, siempre dice que uno no debe aprender historia desde las películas. Y estas series y películas deben ser vistas desde el punto de vista del entretenimiento. Si se quiere saber más sobre Escobar, una serie no va a ser el documento más verídico, así diga que fue basada en una historia real.  Por otro lado, está dirigida por Jose Padilha, que hizo un par de películas bacanas en Brasil (Elite Squad), pero que si uno las ve bajo la misma lupa que se quiere ver esta serie, uno diría quie esas películas son una falta de respeto para las familias humildes de Río."

Colombia,3dh9st,dr_van_nostren,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:29:29 2015 UTC,"I think this looks fucking awesome, but I'm strictly looking at it as entertainment.  Just like I would've if the Vincent Chase Medellin movie were a real thing, just like I would watch the novela about Pablo as well.  I'm not Colombian, but as a part-time citizen of Medellin I know what people think about Colombia, it's not fair, not anymore.  I'm ok with that though, because I know better, so does everyone I talk to.  I think the guy they picked to be Pablo looks a bit off though, hopefully he gets a good fat transformation later in the series.    Lastly, I think it would've been better had it been directed/produced/acted in Spanish and subtitled in English, but there's probably less money in it for them that way, so that's understandable.  At the end of the day, some people are probably not going to like this, it's their prerogative to not watch.  It's entertainment, just like any other movie/tv show, personally I think there's lots of trashy Colombian TV out there, it just doesn't leave the country much."

There's lots of Colombian actors though so I just figured they could've gotten those people and maybe put on the accent, or just done without.  I just think these kinda movies are a bit goofy when all the Nazis speak English, or the Colombians in this case.  I realize why they do it, and sometimes I'm not willing to read subtitles, but I like what it adds."

Not even Klim makes that taste good. Ecuadorians use ito and ita constantly, way more than Colombians. Actually none of the Colombians I know use it much. Ciao? Exclusive enough to id someone as Colombian? Any linguists to confirm this? Arguing. Yeah that's not exclusive to us. Arepas con mantequilla, arepas con queso, arepas de choclo, arepa fries, yeah I'm hungry now. Aguardiente? Not exclusively. In Colombia it's easy to get. In the US it's nostalgic. Shakira = religion?

Um, how small are the fincas in Colombia if every other person has one? Coffee. Can't disagree there. Talking with hands? Nope. Maybe rolos. I'm from Cali, none of my family does this and I don't see it much when I'm down there. My family and friends from Medellin also don't do this. Whatever cereal they first came across is what all cereal is. My grandmother and my aunts call it Cheerios. I'm guessing it's more of an immigrant thing. The e in front of the s is standard pronunciation for Latin Americans that learn English as a second language. Definitely not exclusive to us. Yeah.

Colombia,3da7bg,popuchuris,5,Tue Jul 14 19:27:14 2015 UTC,"Different culture implies different language, and different language includes different body language.  I my experience there is body language in walking and we bump into each other when one of us fails to communicate his/her intention or the other fails to read it (it is kind of subconscious), maybe you need to walk with more assertiveness or observe well the alignment of the shoulders of people and their eyes.  Just my crazy theory."
Colombia,3da7bg,Truand,4,Wed Jul 15 00:20:06 2015 UTC,"I've noticed the same thing. A group of Colombians taking up the entire sidewalk will not make any room for you, even if you're just one.

I guess if you walk without purpose you're bound to get knocked down, and that's true everywhere in the world.  EDIT: Since you seem to have walked all over Colombia and hold the truth for all Colombians, I've followed this same rule in Manizales, Cartagena, Santa Marta, Bogota, Barrancabermeja, Medellin, Cucuta and I've never had an issue, I've always walked normally without bumping/being bumped. Perhaps you're doing something wrong when walking. Who am I to know."

Colombia,3d6bmx,illimitable1,8,Mon Jul 13 21:32:07 2015 UTC,"I'll try my best to be as descritptive as possible but do take into account I am not uribista so my description may be biased. Others with different views may offer different views.  At its core, uribismo is the the following of the ideology (and to a certain extent the tone and character) of Álvaro Uribe. To understand where Uribe's popularity comes from we have to go back to the 2002 presidential election. The 1998-2002 period was governed a conservative president Andrés Pastrana who tried to hold peace talks with las Farc but in the end the talks were unsuccessful. Also, this was a tough time economically for the country.  Uribe's main proposal was to ramp up the military offensive against Farc and regain territorial control of the country. As time went by he continued to consolodiate the military offensive and the economy started getting better, partly due to policy and partly due to the commodity boom that happened all over Latin America and the World. What's key is that Uribe was (and still is to many people) a very popular person, and as such was able to secure reelection in 2006.  On the flipside, his adversaries argue that his presidency came with many irregularities and scandals, including his reelection, the governments dealing with right wing paramilitaries, and that now many of his close advisors and ministers are facing legal trouble.  What is really interesting is that in 2010 Santos was elected pretty much as a successor to Uribe, but he began to distance himself rather quickly from Uribe in terms of foreign policy, his ministers, among other issues. This escalated until peace talks began with las Farc which is where there was a definite break, as Uribists are generally opposed to the way the talks are going. Some of them argue that there should be no negotiation with las Farc, others argue that these talks should be taken in a much different way. There are of course people who are not Uribists and oppose/criticize the talks, but this is still a main point of uribismo."

Colombia,3czr7f,SpontaneousDream,3,Sun Jul 12 06:51:36 2015 UTC,"Let's go from the end first.  HOPEFULLY you're asking for $1000 as a guide and nothing more, cuz it won't last long.  Colombia can be very cheap, but if you're talking about going to Ecuador etc after, you'll be broke before you hit the border.  In Cartagena, you can get a hostel or whatever at like $30 a night, but you'll die of heat unless you're from Houston or Miami.  The humidity is a killer, I was convinced I wouldn't need it, but after 1 essentially sleepless night with 3 fans pointed directly at me, I had to switch to a real hotel with AC.  Hostels are available with AC, but lots of them charge you to the point where you may as well spring for something a bit better. In Cartagena, Spanish is less important than anywhere else in the country, as they cater to tourists.  However, the English is a bit grimy.  If you're a Brit, it might be a bit tougher than if you're American.   BEST place to stay is Bocagrande, or Laguito, but it's also the most expensive.  There are some cheaper places near that area, but point being you're gonna wanna be somewhere near the beach, in land it gets a bit dirtier and there's less to see/do.  If you can find a place within the walled city, it's a bit overrun with tourists (but all of Cartagena is) otherwise very recommendable. Lots of these questions are pretty basic, I'd suggest picking up the Lonely Planet guide, it'll give you more specifics.  Cartagena hosts lots of festivals, music, movies, conventions and whatever else, but I don't have a calendar for any of them. $1000, now depending on where you stay...you can get a hostel for like $30, AC room for $50-60 minimum, food can be had for cheap if you buy on the street or in little local restaurants, otherwise it gets pretty pricey quickly, American brands and higher end seafood etc.  In Medellin, I can party fairly good and spend $1000 in a week.  I could stretch to 10 days being a bit more conservative.  2 weeks tops.  Cartagena won't last that long.  I was used to paying as low as $15 for a hotel in Medellin, I don't think that exists in Cartagena.  So I'd say $1000 is ok for a week if you don't plan to hit clubs or anything. Spanish, again...in Cartagena, anywhere in the touristy area you'll be ok for the most part with english.  On the beach, if you're obviously not hispanic, they won't even approach you in Spanish, they'll go straight to English.  Personally I find it really annoying.  Between major cities you'll get nowhere without Spanish.  I can't speak to the other countries, but from an outsider perspective I'd suggest Ecuador and Bolivia are a little less advanced than Colombia, Peru may be on equal footing."
Colombia,3czr7f,dr_van_nostren,2,Sun Jul 12 12:10:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. Yea the $1000 is just a guide for me to grasp how far it would go. For my entire trip (Colombia>Ecuador>Peru>Bolivia) I was planning on bringing around $6,000. I think that's reasonable and would last me pretty long.   Do you think 1 month is enough time to see a decent amount of stuff in Colombia?  And yea I really don't like touristy areas- but tickets from NYC to Cartagena are only like $200 right now! So worst case I could just fly into Cartagena, and if I feel it's too touristy for me, then move on to something else.  Thanks again."
Colombia,3czr7f,nickolazx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:35:30 2015 UTC,It should be enough. Have a good time!
Colombia,3czr7f,dr_van_nostren,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:04:35 2015 UTC,"$6000 should last you like...6-8 weeks depending on how much you're moving around and what you're doing.    1 month for Colombia is fine, again depending on what you're doing.  There's lots of outdoor activity to do in Colombia, that's not exactly my scene so you'll have to get that from someone else.  I'm a concrete jungle guy, so to me Cartagena, Bogota, Medellin, Cali all hold some interest for me.    I'd like to visit Cucuta and the overland borders with Venezuela and Ecuador, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.    You can spend probably 3 weeks in Santa Marta/Parque Tayrona if you want, another week in Eje Cafetero.  But like I said it all depends on what you wanna do.  I wouldn't spend more than 4-5 days in Cartagena, most of the stuff to see/do is clustered in the area near the airport and south (if my geography is right).  Plus because it's hot/expensive, see what you wanna see and bail unless you just wanna spend time on the beach.    Keep in mind the safety of bus travel if you're gonna go that route.  There's still lots of guerilla activity in the Antioquia region outside of Medellin.  I've gone overnight from Medellin/Bogota/Cali, never had any issues, but I see the articles every week.  Often no one is harmed, but the bus gets blown up and just generally inconveniences and scares everyone.  Flying Avianca domestically can be fairly cheap and VivaColombia is even cheaper but they'll get you with fees and crappy departure times.  Going south of Cali bus is prolly a better option as flights to places like Pasto seem to always be kinda pricey."
Colombia,3czr7f,dr_van_nostren,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:36:48 2015 UTC,"$6000 should last you like...6-8 weeks depending on how much you're moving around and what you're doing.   In Colombia? Or are you saying in total (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia)? I was under the impression that Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia could all be done for around $1,000 a month.   $6,000 lasting me 6-8 weeks is almost a $1,000 a week...that sounds like total overkill from a spending standpoint."
Colombia,3czr7f,dr_van_nostren,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:22:50 2015 UTC,"That's why I stipulated depending on what you're doing though and how much moving around.  The bus rides aren't going to be super expensive, flights between countries can get stupidly pricey for some reason.  But if you're on a bus for 24 hours, you're gonna spend virtually $0.  So it's VERY subjective.  I spent like $1000 a week cuz I don't hold back and I have fun, knowing that I won't be there too long.  I drink alot, go out with friends, pay bills etc.  When I'm touring around Colombia I don't spend as much but Medellin is my 2nd home and as such I spend more.  $1000 a month...I think thats very low.  I know $1000 a week is high, but let's assume you spend $25 a night on lodging (which may be low, a hostel bed in Medellin often costs like $35-40, whereas a motel can be as low as $12-15, but it's not for everyone).  That's $750 for 30 days.  That leaves you $8 a day for food over 30 days.  COULD you do this?  Probably.  But you likely wouldn't want to, and there's no telling what lodging would cost exactly.  Even if you drop the average to $20 a night that's $600 for 30 days, that leaves $13 a day for food.  Even $13 a day...that means you're eating every meal on the street, which isn't so bad, but it also means you're probably not eating 3 times a day, which also isn't the end of the world, but it's very limiting.  That also means no money for...well anything other than the bare essentials.  If you're the type of person that wants to hitchhike, sleep in a park, that kind of thing, then sure.  But the fact that you have $6000 to begin with leads me to believe that's probably not you.    Quick math says you should be ok for 4 months.  $25*120nights = $3000/120(days) = $25 a day for food, which is probably a bit more than needed.  But that still doesn't factor in any plane tickets/busses or anything above the $25 a night average for lodging.  If you've got an open jaw ticket, cool, keep in mind Colombian officials may not allow you to enter the country on a 1-way ticket as you'll be entering on a foreign passport.  That's something you'll need to look in to, from what I understand there's ways around it, but I've got no experience there, I always have a set return date.  You're also gonna want some money around if something goes wrong.  That may just be a western union from your parents, that's fine, I've always got that in my back pocket if something catastrophic happens.    So now I've broken down the 4 month cost.  Honestly, if I were you, I'd target, 13-16 weeks tops.  Could you maybe stretch it further, yea maybe.  But if you wanna move around, odds are you can't.  You'll find places lower than $25, I know I sure did, but they're also harder to find in some places, or unacceptable.  I was fine in a $12 motel in Medellin, in fact I've stayed in a few of them.  I had a harder time finding something in that range in Cali, so I ended up spending like $40 a night...hence the $25 average."
Colombia,3czr7f,olakalaco,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:38:01 2015 UTC,"Ah okay that helps a lot. I knew Colombia was pricier than Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, but I wasn't sure how much pricier it was. And yea I'm still trying to figure out the one way ticket thing.   Thanks!"
Colombia,3czr7f,sryvre,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:45:05 2015 UTC,"You could be right, I've never been to the other 3.  I just think that $25 a day for lodging is a decent estimate...maybe you'll find that it's generous.  A mixed dorm hostel bed might only run you an average of 12-15, but that still didn't offer tonnes of wiggle room as I had factored in only food and nothing more.  I don't wanna discourage you at all, $6000 is a decent chunk of cheese.  But I think $1000 a month is way under budget, that's just me personally.  I'm sure you could do it, I'm just not sure you'd want to based on the sacrifices that'd have to be made.    The other thing to consider is laundry, again I can only speak to Colombia...laundry is a pain in the ass.  In Medellin to get laundry done, I had to ask friends to use their machines, or kinda bribe the hotels.  Hostels make that a bit easier as most have pay facilities, but outside of those, laundromats often don't exist or are stupid expensive.  There's very few laundromats in Medellin from what I've seen and most are in the touristy/hostel part of town cuz frankly, no one else needs them, but as such, they charge way more than they should imo.  The other places around are usually just dry cleaners, which will get the job done, but they'll way over charge."
Colombia,3czr7f,hardskapunk,2,Mon Jul 13 08:15:33 2015 UTC,"In Cartagena taxi drivers tend to overcharge tourists and even locals. Before you take one ask around what would be a fair price to get you to your destination, and confirm this with the driver BEFORE you hop in. The difference can be from 5.000 COP to 20.000 COP. Same advice with street food, souvenirs, etc."
Colombia,3czr7f,Cockatoo010,2,Sun Jul 12 14:24:36 2015 UTC,"Cartagena's awesome! And December will be the coolest time to go temperature wise as it's the breezy season-though the tourist numbers will be much higher the last two weeks of the year and into January with the holidays.  There are many hostels that I've heard good things about in both the walled city and barrio Getsemaní. The Plaza De Trinidad is always pretty popular with both locals and tourists mingling in the evening, performers, food carts, etc.   I think $1000 USD should be enough - I lived on $500 USD a month there, which included roughly $175 for rent. So definitely doable. I'd recommend eating the local lunch specials, usually no more than 7mil.   Also I'm a gringa from the northern states and I never had AC and survived quite well :) don't be afraid to shower/rinse off a couple of times a day, the coast is very hot and humid and that's a pretty typical practice from my experiences-Colombians are very conscious of smelling good.  I don't think Cartagena has much for nature besides the ocean, but as someone else mentioned, Santa Marta is much better known for that. I travelled using Berlinas (transport company) and I think it was about 40COP between CTG and SM, and half that to go to Barranquilla.   Don't dar papaya! Don't carry around nice electronics or huge amounts of money. Or split your money between pockets. Don't wander empty streets alone outside of the walled city/boca grande.   Drink 3 liters of water a day. Use sun screen.  If you're going to wander out into Cartagena proper (not the tourist areas), just be aware of your surroundings. You're a less likely target as a man, but you'll still be associated with having things worth stealing. I lived in the barrios for two years and loved it but there is huge inequality in Cartagena (and Colombia in general), so to be outside of the tourist hub can make you more vulnerable to theft or robbery. Just be smart and you should be fine!  Oh, and when you catch a cab from the airport, go to the taxi stand and they'll print a receipt to your destination with a predetermined cost so the taxi's can't rip you off. It should never cost more than 15mil from the airport to Laguito. Don't be afraid to haggle a bit.  Enjoy Cartagena, it's a beautiful and vibrant city with some of the most laid back, good humored people you'll meet :)"
Colombia,3czr7f,molecularpoet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:48:47 2015 UTC,"Hey man! Good luck with your trip. Things to do... That's a long answer! North to south, you should visit San Andrés Island for a caribbean feeling; Cabo de la Vela in La Guajira for deserts and beaches; Santa Marta (including Taganga, Tayrona Park and if you want a several-day jungle hike to Lost City), Cartagena is a must of course, Medellín and Bogotá are the major cities and have plenty of things to fo, with many towns and natural sites for short trips; Pereira, Manizales and its surroundings (go to Los Nevados Natural Park for several day hiking trips up in the mountains); San Gil, Barichara and San Agustín are archaeological and extreme sports centers; Cali for some salsa dancing and cool people and head to Popayán and its surroundings for more hikes before heading out of the country. Try to be in February for the Carnival in Barranquilla, it's a lot of fun! Christmas and New Year's in the coffee axis (around Medellín, Pereira, Manizales, Armenia) is awesome, try to spend it with the locals instead of at an expat hangout. As for hostels there are plenty but I can't recommend any, I couchsurf most of the time as the community is great.  As for costs, it is cheaper than the US but more expensive than SE Asia. Hostels from 7 USD, a filling meal from 2.5 USD, bus/metro fares under 1 USD. A 1000 USD goes a long way, most young professionals make around 700 a month! I only complain about transportation, as airlines tend to be expensive (VivaColombia is the only low-cost carrier) but short- and long-distance bus rides and hitchhiking are readily available.  Spanish and English are not that different, you'll survive! Learn the basics, rely on cognates and trust people (but not too much, the super touristy gringos are seen as walking ATMs by many; be wary of taxi drivers in particular, and go with your gut). No tipping required.   I'm from Barranquilla but live in Bogotá. Feel free to ask me any questions."

Colombia,3czoyc,tulipanmarchito,2,Sun Jul 12 06:20:22 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you mean...not sure what you're talking about when you say ""launch deals""...  There's oodles of things to do outside of Bogota.  Bogota has no beaches, so if you wanna hit a beach you're screwed.    Medellin has a better climate, warmer but not too hot like the coast, so that's a draw.  There's plenty of concerts and such that go to Medellin and Cali, some of the biggest international acts only go to Bogota, but for someone who REALLY wants to go, they can make a quick overnight trip.   natural to you?  Sure, but just like in the US, in a lot of ways if you're not in LA/SF/NY you're not relevant.  I don't think most people resent that.  Sure they'd love their favorite band to come to Green Bay, but if you want it that bad, you can go somewhere else to see them, no big deal. what do you do about it?  nothing.  Promoters try to get bigger acts to come, sometimes they succeed.  Madonna and Beyonce both had massive concerts in Medellin in 2014 and both were huge successes.   Maybe a little..."
Colombia,3czoyc,dr_van_nostren,2,Sun Jul 12 10:17:25 2015 UTC,"I think Bogotá has a lot to offer, but a lot of crap goes along the way. Therefore I think Bogotá is amazing but you have to make an effort in finding those things you like. What I love from Bogotá is that there is a cultural scene for everybody and this is something many Colombians do not realize. Homogeneity is something many of us are comfortable with and do not understand that many people do not give a damn about vallenato, dancing, reggeton, or any of the most popular things Colombian people enjoy. Therefore Bogotá offers that space.  Regarding culture, although Bogotá offers a lot, historically the most interesting artists of Colombia have come from Medellín and Cali. Lots of writers, painters with non-conservative ideas were made in those cities so when it comes to a edgier side of culture, Cali, Medellin and even Manizales are more progressive. Many of those progressive ideas end up in Bogotá afterwards, but the raw material comes from those cities."

Regarding ""what to do about it"", plenty happens in other cities (Medellín, Cali and Barranquilla, mostly), or people commute to the big events.   Even, some things are easier to find outside of Bogotá. As a bit of an example, something I recently went trough: want to find decent fishing equipment? You'll have to head out to the coast or Medellín, otherwise you'll have to spend days hopping from store to store untill you find what you need."

That being the case if you do go to barrios that are perdominately afro-latinos and he's one of races above he will definitely stick out.    I just spent a month in region in Jan.

Especialmente porque algunos sectores se radicalizan en su apoyo o repudio al proceso de paz, y empiezan a jugar el juego de que los del otro bando son ""terroristas guerrilleros"" o son ""uribistas antipacifistas paramilitares"".  la historia del conflicto en Colombia es muy larga: somos el país con la guerra civil más larga en la actualidad, y nadie tiene opiniones sencillas, pero voy a responder las preguntas de todas formas   no 'apoyo' a ninguno de los dos grupos. El ejército es una organización necesaria en un estado social de derecho.

Los guerrilleros luchan porque les pagan y porque tienen una mala excusa de comunismo y revolución y justicia social. En palabras de William Ospina en ¿Dónde Está la Franja Amarilla?: ""Yo sostengo que es el Estado colombiano imperante, con su ineficiencia y su irrespeto por los reclamos de la ciudadanía, el que fuerza a los campesinos a adherir a esos movimientos armados que no tienen ningún futuro, pero que por lo menos tienen presente""   texto completo: http://ojosabiertos.galeon.com/aficiones1610067.html"

Respecto a las preguntas acerca del conflicto:  No hay como tal apoyo hacia las FARC y sus acciones de parte de los colombianos, por lo cual las primeras dos preguntas no son acertadas. Lo que si hay en Colombia es una opinión acerca del proceso de paz que se encuentra en proceso, están aquellos que lo apoyan (beneficiando a quienes hacen parte de las FARC) y quienes se oponen por la misma razón y prefieren continuar con la labor del ejército de ""erradicarlos"". Personalmente apoyo el proceso ya que la segunda opción no cambia nada en lo absoluto y por falta de un correcto manejo de las fuerzas del estado ""erradicarlos"" sería una tarea inútil, pero no apoyo las prácticas de las FARC ya que consisten en el beneficio económico a costa del tráfico de drogas y del desplazamiento y arrebato de tierras escondido detrás de una ideología que hace mucho tiempo dejaron de seguir.  Los medios masivos en Colombia son muy restringidos y suelen ser parte de grupos económicos y políticos por lo cual nunca han sido como tal ""justos"" respecto a las situaciones del país, pero como mencioné antes, en Colombia no se apoya lo que se ha convertido las FARC por lo cual los medios muestran lo que el pueblo piensa EN ESE TEMA SOLAMENTE. En cuestión del proceso de paz he notado que han sido imparciales ya que ambas posiciones involucran una gran parte de la población.  Sería bueno que ocurriera justicia y aún se castigara a aquellos que cometieron crímenes contra la población ya que , aunque no todos están en las FARC por voluntad propia, aquellos que se ven beneficiados de actividades ilícitas las seguirán practicando y se convertirá en un problema en las ciudades. De igual manera hay un porcentaje que pertenece a esta por razones fuera de su control, como temor a su propia vida o a la de sus familias entre otras, los cuales podrían optar por la desmovilización y restablecer su vida.  Las guerrillas en Colombia comenzaron a luchar por diferencias ideológicas con el estado, razón por la cual se ve como una guerra civil, pero con el pasar del tiempo y el surgimiento del narcotráfico esto ha ido cambiando y actualmente se encuentran impulsadas por las ganancias económicas que deja este entre otras prácticas. El ejército por otra parte se supone lucha por el bienestar del Estado y la seguridad de la población."

Colombia,3csv34,illimitable1,3,Sat Jul 11 03:52:28 2015 UTC,"The matter of ""supporting a group"" is a difficult one, to put it mildly. Any and all sides (there's way more than 2 of them) has screwed up big time at one point or another, fucked over civilians, and done downright immoral things to try and gain power. Right now, all we can do is get it over with as fast as possible, and stop a situation that hasn't worked in anyone's favor for 50 years or more. Yes, some demands of the guerrillas (on paper, at the very least) are reasonable and necesary, but that's about it, they are hypocrites, just like the far right groups that oppose them with more vehemence. The paramilitaries are just plain and simple thugs, sometimes paid by the big land-owners, sometimes paid by the big drug runners (and some times it's hard to tell the difference), and they are still alive and well, despite the laughable ""peace process"" faked by Uribe's government. We are stuck with somewhat tepid ""centrist"" alternatives and ineffectual leaders who can't organize their way out of a paper bag, unless it's to get rich off of our tax money. conservatives (classic catholic and protestant right wing) won't budge out of their troglodyte positions, but they at least are  organized, consistent, and you know where they'll stand in any and all issues, even if they stand in a pile of bullshit. The left is, plain and simple, a shitshow of bizantine squabbles and overinflated egos, peppered with anachronic rethoric and out of touch proposals. The greens had promise, but they got infected with the bloated egos and stupid fights, so there's just a few decent faces left in that party... and no organization whatsoever. What else is left?   The media? that one's easy: It's trash. Massive chains are heavily biased towards the right wing sectors of society (neoliberalism, uribism, conservatism) and ""alternative media"", trying to act as a counterweight... goes to the other side of trash. There's a few outlets that at least try to get a balanced view of the situation, but they are few and far in between (lasillavacia.com comes to mind).  Ideally? we'd get a full commitement by all parties to drop the weapons. Combatants would join the army in mixed regiments and their re-introduction into civilian society would be handled by a heavily overseen body of both military and civilian authorities. The leaders would go to jail for reduced sentences, the forcibly drafted members of all sides (estimated to be about 80% of the guerrillas, for example) would get counseling and aid, and the most problematic elements of all groups (chainsaw butchers, child rapists, embezzlers, and the like) will be sent to some mosquito-ridden penal colony to work their problems between bouts of dengue.

It's possible to say that the character of the conflict has changed in the past 15-20 years, or that we should speak of it in the terms used by, say, Wikipedia, which calls it an ""internal armed conflict.""  ""somos el país con la guerra civil más larga en la actualidad"""
Colombia,3csv34,illimitable1,2,Sat Jul 11 13:39:14 2015 UTC,"The guy you commented on is a little passionate so I will try to give you a less aggressive perspective. The FARC were founded as self defense militias and such to protect farmers against corporate interests and the army and such (partly as a result of massacres of farmers by the army when the US wanted to quell resistance against their big companies in the country). They also were linked to Marxism Leninism (FARc exclusively, other such as th ELN are Maoist and other denominations). This turned the country into a small proxy for the Cold War. As such FARC could count on the financing of other socialist countries. When the Soviet Union and other countries started either becoming bankrupt or and the country lost its importance in the international sphere the FARC lost its international financing. When that happened they started using extortion, kidnapping and drug trafficking to finance themselves (by started using I do not mean it is the first time they did it, I am saying they started to ramp up their revenue making with them). After so much time since the start of the conflict they started betraying some of their ideals in order to attempt to secure military victory. This lost them most of their popular support. This process continued with most of the idealist rankers and many of the idealist officers being killed or arrested and as such the new recruits were no so ideologically linked. But the FARC started producing enormous revenue streams. As such people started to see an opportunity of making money by joining. This is were it evolved into a criminal organization mostly in it for the money. That is when they lost almost all popular support and when the war stopped being a revolution like in Cuba and instead an operation against criminality. That is not discount all the ideological links from the FARC, they still have some members who joined from the start who surely still have ideological concerns. But now it is mostly a mafia."

Colombia,3csv34,illimitable1,2,Sat Jul 11 17:12:35 2015 UTC,"Oh no that's a different story, I limited my post to talking about the FARC. The AUC was 'disbanded' but really they just went from being basically tacitlly supported by the state to just being criminal mafia. Really the story for many of these groups is very similar. They started with ideals and eventually saw the potential money making opportunities for their group and became criminal syndicates. That is part of the problem, even if the military and police destroy the different groups' regular forces the remaining members become mafias and such, although that is much less dangerous and so I believe it to be far better. The good news is that the influence of the groups becomes lesser the larger the city or town becomes. So with a few exceptions the mayor cities are free from those problems, and as such the majority of the population."

Colombia,3csv34,Iratus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:58:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry I didn't get to your responses yesterday. I'm going to put my response in English because it's easier to articulate my point.  From what I've seen so far reddit has confirmed what I thought would happen. This is a generalisation but I assume most of the people here are affluent colombians. Obviously this comes with its own biases (like mine being a foreigner) and it is interesting how it plays out.  I've been lucky enough to associate with hugely different groups in Colombia. People from poor barrios in Santa Marta where I was working, the bourgeoisie is Bogota, the indigenous groups around the Amazon and in the Andes and all sorts of burros locos.  I'm not going to say I found direct support for the Farc but I found people sympathetic to some of their causes. For example, people are resistant to foreign ownership of natural resources, want protection for indigenous communities in the amazon and in some cases see the value of narcotrafficking.  From a naive foreign perspective I see the tumultuous history of Colombia as wildy fascinating and narcotrafficking as a key part of its development. It might offend some here (sorry) but I don't think Colombia would be one of the leading Latin countries without its dominance of this market and its role in the past. It brought a lot of foreign money to the country and in a way this aided grow Colombia to what it is now. However, this didn't come without a price as I'm sure everyone is aware.  I have also talked to the people in communities where the Farc is more active and although they fear being recorded for the consequences have expressed their support for the group because they are for the people. In contrast, the military (both in reality) commits heinous crimes and has blamed it on the farc. Displacing local communities to bring in foreign industry and money. I'm aware that this isn't concrete evidence but I'm just trying to express alternative points of view that I have come across.  Furthermore, support seems to be stronger in public universities and these groups come into conflict with the same government bodies. I think most would accept that the government and related bodies are filled with corruption and are continually robbing the naturally rich country of Colombia from the people.   In regards to the recent peace talks (and in general) I find the coverage on the media to be completely disgusting, highly manipulative and biased. I feel, like in most countries, that the media represents the mouthpiece of the government and serves regurgitating the government discourse so the people who don't access other sources take this for their own opinion.   International organisations have made comment about the supposed ~500,000 'falsos positivos' that were murdered under the Uribe government. These people were explained as having no connection with the war, the Farc or any organisation but they were in an area that the government wished to control. These can be journalists, with people controversial opinions or simply gente del campo. Just recently a journalist (Paula Salgado) was arrested for having a photo of Camilo Torres in her facebook. This case isn't isolated and I'm sure some of you are conscious of these people that just seem to disappear who don't follow the government line. This is not uncommon outside of Colombia either.  Please don't take this as support for the FARC because realistically I have a very 'young' opinion and I obviously can't be completely informed about all that has gone on in this country. However, I certainly see that there are huge errors and atrocities commited by both sides and I'd be more inclined to say both sides are in the wrong.   TL;DR- I don't think the argument is black and white. I think both sides are at fault, both have interesting viewpoints and the country could benefit as a whole in trying to accomodate a more holistic viewpoint.   Un amigo me explico que Colombia es como una sala de espera que tiene goteras. Uribe y su equipo proponen traer baldes y traperos para limpiar el agua. Y las otras personas proponen resonar el techo y arregular las fugas. Los Colombianos les creen a los primeros y se bulan de los segundos gracias a los medios de comunicacion y al abuso de poder"

I'd say he FARC's proposals, at least on their public-facing side attempts at PR, are classical leftist positions that naturaly gain footing in a society such as ours. The problem is that after 50 years of war, most of the left is reluctant to openly state support for them. Even my most hardcore leftist acquaintances would say that it's foolish to continue trying to overtrow the government after 50 years of failing to do so, and that ""armed revolution"" is 30 years (if not more) past it's time. You still see open suport for them, every now and then, but in my experience comes from young impressionable people who still think ""no pasarán"" is a strong, not-anachronic-at-all sentence to utter in a march supporting anything left-of-center, or from people who live deep inside their most influenced areas. Basically, the FARC, ELN and their supporters are trying to ignore the zeitgeist, trying to force something that can't happen, and was proven to be a failure when it happened.

Anyone who gets offended by that is a fool. It's the truth. Drugs kep our economy afloat during the 80s and 90s TBH, I'm somewhat torn on the issue of drug-dealing, because it's part of something much bigger that goes beyond the FARC and our national borders. Drugs should not be a crime by themselves, plain and simple, but drug dealers end up being the worst kind of scum. The FARC should be made accountable for their crimes on every other aspect, but I wouldn't mind if everyone ignored ""making drugs to sell in the US"", just because the bloody ""war on drugs"" is a stupid, stupid, stupid policy that exhacerbates the ""problem"" it's supposed to tackle, and the US government is to blame for it, basically.

I'd like to see new eyes on the drug issue, working on corruption/for the people and the ownership and use of Colombias resources.  Drugs could be such a good advancing platform for Colombia if there on the right side of legalisation. It certainly has a history in the industry and has a 'signature'  drug to be its label. I also agree with you that the EEUU is the primary source for this issue. If Colombia could be forward thinking on this issue it could really bring forward an already advancing country.  My main points with drugs: *any issue from drug use is a health issue not criminal. The war on drugs makes criminal circle fill a gap between demand and supply *People should have the right to control their consciouness. There already exists laws that focus on dangerous/damaging behaviour let them guide behaviour. Prohibition doesn't work  Haha.

Is bigger so there's more stuff to do (La dorada is a little town, while Tunja is a city by its own), prettier, and you can go to Bogotá in a little more than 2 hours (from La Dorada is no less than four)"

The weather isn't as hot, the place has much more to offer in terms of culture and history, and Boyacá (the department where Tunja is) is really beautiful and has nice attractions, such as Villa de Leyva which is a popular tourist destination, a few nice towns and you're 2-3 hours away from Bogota. You'd also be close to Barichara and San Gil which are popular destinations for ecotourism and things like rafting, hiking, rappel."
Colombia,3ctkid,Juan-man,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:54:02 2015 UTC,"As a foreigner, you might enjoy La Dorada more.  Tunja can get cold (not as much as Canada, of course), but it is a mid-sized city. A former capital of the region, it has large churches, and a rich history.   La Dorada is a smallish town, and warmer climate comes with livelier people, IMO. Women from Caldas are generally more attractive than women in Boyacá (the Tunja region), although there are exceptions."
Colombia,3ctkid,vikmaychib,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:35:31 2015 UTC,"Well, I am from Bogotá which may make me a Tunja hater. The best part of Tunja is that is very close to amazing spots in Boyacá. It is true that the weather in Dorada can be problematic, but people are living there. If you like outdoors, not far from Dorada is Doradal where you can visit the Río Claro which is pretty amazing.   Form an idealistic point of view, just check where do you think there would more impact in your project."
Colombia,3ctkid,Davidnet,2,Sat Jul 11 08:57:19 2015 UTC,"Tunja has a more relaxed enviroment. Although the city is not that beautiful, the towns around are extremely beautiful and calm.

Also try facebook, out of 47 million colombians around 17 million have an account so you have 36% of a chance of finding them there (provided they are normal and not privacy concerned)."

Colombia,3ckdgx,Iratus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:16:03 2015 UTC,"The trickiest bit, as far as I can see, is that those surnames are quite common, so it's not going to help you much, unless you ask local people.   Funny thing, I've met 3 other colombian-born adopted danes around your age (a bit younger, even). They came back here as exchange students, but I'm not sure about their success reconecting to their families. I do know one of them was not interested at all in doing so. Perhaps there is a local colombian community you could reach? immigrants will undoubtely be glad to help you, or at least point you in the right direction.   Anyway, don't be worried about people getting mad if you contact them trough Facebook, worst case-scenario they'll ignore you."

I just can't.   I have also found that people don't mind me contacting them via facebook. I was directed to a group called ""Salamina!!!!"" but it turned out to be a group for Salamina in Magdalena and not in Caldas. But they were more than happy to help me despite my mistake."
Colombia,3ckdgx,Slukad,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:54:42 2015 UTC,"most people wil be happy to help: it's in our nature!. So don't focus so much on talking to people with the same lastname (a.k.a surname or family name) of your parents, and invest all your energy in finding people of Salamina, Caldas. One person from the town can hook you up with the next person from town, until you get to somebody that knows about your parents, or at least directs you to another town where they lived longer than Salamina.

Here's the thing, if you're a brand new customer, you get away with it once. If you're a REGULAR, and you see them dozens of times a month, and after all that, you still don't talk to them like they're humans, as in ask how they are doing, and stuff like that, they will think you absolutely do not give a shit about them or anything other than just getting your coffee and food. It makes you seem fake when all you do is just act like the customer and treat them like their entire purpose in life is to just stand there and take orders, instead of actually participating in a casual conversation.  Treat them like you would a friend or family member, actually say ""Hello how are you? How have you been? Nice haircut!""  ANYTHING like that, just add SOMETHING besides just ordering your food. You DO know how to treat people like people rather than AI drive-thru menus, right? Act like you actually go there every day to see THEM as well as get your food, not JUST to get your food, because right now that's the message you are sending, like they don't matter at all, they could be fired and replaced and you wouldn't bat an eye, and just say ""Hello, give me coffee."" like usual. That's what they think of you, that you don't give a shit about any of them as people. Sure some hide it because they don't care enough to let it bother them on the outside, and they're trained as sales reps to act like they love everyone, but just because you only see the negativity on that one girl's face doesn't mean the others don't also feel the same as her."

However as far as you moving here, I wouldn't worry too much.  You probably have a better chance of getting shot and killed in the USA than you do of getting killed here.    I travel a lot.  There is always something somewhere.  Always.  I was in Thailand the day before the Tsunami, I was in Mumbai during the terrorist attacks, I left Bromo right before that volcano erupted, in the bay area during the 7.2 Earthquake, etc.    I'd be more worried about a car accident than these things.  With that said this government really needs to get their shit together.

I've had to travel back to the US every now and then for work so I haven't had to worry about an actual visa yet (and probably won't this year). Once I finish my current job in the states then I will look for work here to get a work visa and be more permanent. I should probably mention I work in documentaries and film so I'm able to edit in Colombia and go back and forth to film.

Colombia,3bf1y6,Garboq,3,Mon Jun 29 06:50:52 2015 UTC,"Por norma general, los almuerzos en cuanto Menú del día, cuestan aproximadamente 10 000 pesos. Las cenas tienden a ser un poco más costosas. La entrada a algunos museos varía entre los cinco y los diez mil pesos.   Y hagas lo que hagas, no recibas nada en las playas."

Colombia,3bf1y6,Garboq,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:25:29 2015 UTC,"Corrientazos acá se encuentran desde 6500.  Pero hay dos cosas, primero que no estoy seguro del mercado en Cartagena, segundo que es probable que no se encuentre con sitios en los que llegue a esos precios. Eso también hay que tenerlo en cuenta.  Considerando que es muy probable que pase su estadía en sectores cercanos a la ciudad antigua, aún encontrando almuerzos baratos deben rondar los 10,o eso presupuesto yo.   Es más por ahí que otra cosa."

Por darte un precio de referencia, podés conseguir una Big Mac en combo por menos. Pagar menos es barato, con algunos lugares llegando hasta seis mil pesos por un almuerzo -claro que puede ser por mi ciudad y eso-, pagar más no es excesivo... si no se pasa de los 25. Para mi, pagar más de 25 por cualquier plato, es para una cena especial o algo por el estilo.  Claro que mi percepción es la de un estudiante en otra ciudad, y cuando estuve en Cartagena no era extraño gastar entre 20 y 25 por comida. Entonces ese es como el estandar que manejo."

Colombia,3ayipd,Tacman180,5,Wed Jun 24 15:04:24 2015 UTC,"Hello I'm glad to be able to answer this. Tuition in Colombia is very cheap in comparison with the U.S.  A top PRIVATE university here as ""Los Andes"" would cost you around 5500 US$ a semester so around 11000 US$ a year in tuition, if we add everything else to studying in a high class University I would say around 250 US$ a month for transportation an eating out. And around 600 US$ for a cheap place to live, get your things washed, and get all your meals. So monthly probably around 850 for a private top university. I'm not including much social life in that budget.   For a University like the one you mention tuition is probably around 2000 US$ a semester and the cost of the other stuff would be around 650-700.   If it's a public university it's much cheaper I pay 200 US$ a semester and my parents give me 200 a month for my expenses, I have a car and pay for gas, but I do get all the meals at my house and get to save some money thought I don't go out so I don't spend much.   To help you calculate transportation is around 0.8 a bus and you probably have to use it around 14 times a week for University purposes only but that's really dependent of where one lives and your schedule, a typical snack would be around 1.25 (empanada + gaseosa) a cheap lunch around 3-4, copies of books around 2 dollars a week. That's all I can think about now, hope it helps.   Lastly for the University only including expenses I'd say they can live with 200 US$ a month if they know how to stretch it and have a place to live."
Colombia,3ayipd,Inmute,3,Wed Jun 24 16:28:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your reply! That's more information than I've been able to find all morning.   These public universities you mention, UTP, which I mentioned, is supposed public too. However it does seem to be on the higher end of the scale.   Is there a good resource you could recommend to find more local and possibly cheaper universities? My Spanish is good enough to navigate the Web, no problem.   Also, I did see that there are forms of financial assistance available. Could you enlighten me on how that works in Colombia?   Thanks again!"
Colombia,3ayipd,Inmute,3,Wed Jun 24 17:13:06 2015 UTC,"Well UTP is pretty close to mine according to this Article it says UTP is number 12 in the country.   Public Universities is the cheapest you're going to find, from what I understand what you pay on a public University is dependent on what you have, I was just looking in google and found something indicative of the price in this PDF in the page number five, the 3rd question in the page; this confirms what I was thinking.  Let me go deeper on ""what you have"" it means like Universities in the U.S give financing according to the mutual income of your parentes, and yada yada we do the same with public Universities, but we don't give you financing we just lower the price so pretty much in a Public University in Colombia people pay from a lower end of the spectrum that is around 2.7 Colombian salaries (around 675 US$) to the higher which is around 2000 US$.  Fiancial assistance is usually pretty good in public Universities people usually if smart enough won't drop out because of it. Some of the assistance is wrap around you having some documents (SISBEN and Familias en Acción) that are government programs to help low income families; but there's also a lot that goes for everyone, at least on my Uni which is higher in the list. For example in my Uni you get big discounts for ""working"" in the library a certain amount of hours a week, playing in any University sports team, creating any club or managing (pretty easy to do), being part of cultural groups, etc. There are many ways to get financing whitout working hard.  That all sound good, the real struggle is getting in the Universities, since to get in you got to beat the other people who are trying to get in by getting higher notes in an exam. This is all dependant of the career in my Uni for Engineering they usually pick 45 out of 600-700, for medicine 55 out of 2000-2500 but there's other carrers which dont get that hard like Mathematics probably 45 out of 60, Social work, Lenguages and others."

In my experience, language (and business culture) barriers with Chinese companies are ridiculous. There is definitely a business opportunity if you are fluent and have experience in dealing with these companies.   Don't look for a ""job"", offer your services as a middleman/woman.   Good luck!"

Colombia,3abrbr,Forestgrind,3,Thu Jun 18 20:31:50 2015 UTC,"American here. I'm working in Cucuta. It's an industrial city on the border of Venezuela. There's almost no English speakers in this city, except for people I work with (most are from Bogota). I would imagine more speak English in Bogota. The people are extremely nice and always looking to help you out. It's generally milder weather in Bogota, but here its hot all the time. I have seen no crime or anything that's made me nervous. There are parts of the city that aren't safe, but the same is true of any city. I haven't been to Bogota yet, but I plan to when I have time.   Overall I've been very happy here. They love their soccer, the food is good, and the love dancing."
Colombia,3abrbr,jwfutbol,2,Thu Jun 18 21:38:12 2015 UTC,"What is your main concern OP? If it is safety, Bogotá has a lot of street crime but if you use your common sense and learn to identify threatening situations quickly you'll be grand.  Depends on where you live too - some areas are rougher than others.  Climate? Very mild, expect some 20 degrees on average, some tropical downpours from time to time.  What you will come to hate is traffic: unless you've travelled to countries like India you are really not ready for the chaos of our streets.  Lots of stuff to do, huge city.  Any chance you could make a quick trip before taking the job? Or give yourself six months or a year to try it out?"
Colombia,3abrbr,MiraiSeikatsu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"I think it is just overall safety. I don't like the idea of being restricted. If I want to explore other cities or the countryside, I feel like I won't be able to because of the risk of getting mugged. I am very white and have red hair so I will obviously stand out like a sore thumb.  The weather doesn't really concern me, rain is no problem and I'm glad it isn't too warm there."

Colombia,3abrbr,JediPearce,3,Sun Jun 21 09:03:59 2015 UTC,"I'm in Medellín right now and am moving here next year. When I first came I was terrified I'd light up like a fire cracker (Scott/Irish blood), but to my surprise as long as I use the same common sense I do back home I don't burn too badly. It's the most beautiful place I've ever been (all over the U.S. and Mexico), has the best tasting food (what you'd expect from a country that's largely agrarian), and the most friendly locals (sometimes to the point of irritation for an American like me). Bogotá & Medellín are now considered slightly safer than places like New York City Detroit, New Orleans, and Baltimore with some areas being safer (and more expensive) than others. Colombia as a whole would best be described as a second world country, but if you're being paid in Euros you'll definitely be able to afford all the 1st world luxuries you're used to having, and then some.  Oh, and you will attract a lot of romantic attention. If you're fair skinned with blonde/red hair and blue/green eyes (like me) then you'll see a lot of people staring at you as you walk around. Just be smart, learn Spanish if you can (six months with a tutor should be more than enough), and you'll find Colombia to be one of the best places on Earth."

Colombia,3a7cgr,mateusjay954,6,Wed Jun 17 20:16:02 2015 UTC,"Always be aware of where you are and who is around you. Wear a strap to deter swiping and be wary of people getting close to you and talking to you about anything once you've shown the camera in public. As someone who has been mugged several times in Bogota, I can tell you that keeping your (reasonable) distance to people in these situations is advisable. Muggers will likely try to talk to you about pointless things and close the distance enough so they can flash the knife and threaten you into surrendering your stuff if they know you have valuables and are not walking in a place with a lot of pedestrian traffic. This sounds bad, but it really will not happen everywhere. If you use common sense and are aware of your surroundings (always try to ask about the neighborhoods you will be going to) you should return with great pictures from your trip.   Oh, and NEVER EVER leave valuables lying around anywhere. This is the most common way people lose their stuff.   Good luck on your trip!"
Colombia,3a7cgr,Juan-man,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:14:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I also thought some of the safest ways is probably being in group. Makes sense to me.
Colombia,3a7cgr,loghorninja,2,Thu Jun 18 16:06:50 2015 UTC,"Not really.  The best advise it to simply avoid the bad areas and avoid flashing valuables.  Some ways my family have been mugged are sitting in their car using their phones when a group of 10 people surround the car with knives and demand your phones at a red light.  Another way is that a group of people get on the bus and mug everyone.  There are no cameras on the buses. Doesn't matter that you're in a car, bus, or that you are in a group.  They're not stupid.  99% of the time you'll be fine so don't let this scare you but busting out valuables in public in any place with high poverty is risking it.  Once you get out of the big cities the poverty becomes much less of an issue since you're no longer dealing with poor and displaced populations."
Colombia,3a7cgr,loghorninja,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:58:28 2015 UTC,"sounds about  right, thanks for the advice, I post these questions already knowing how id act i just want a few more insights to add to to my thinking."
Colombia,3a7cgr,nicoleta_,4,Fri Jun 19 03:06:02 2015 UTC,I carry a d600 in either a traditional bag but more often in a small backpack.  I've taken pics basically everywhere but Bogota I generally don't.  Too much risk there.  Even in the touristy areas like candelaria you have to be able to leave safely and I get nervous.  I also don't photograph in the north of medellin.  Outside of the big cities though no problem.

Colombia,3a3j9g,mateusjay954,5,Tue Jun 16 23:08:26 2015 UTC,"I'm from Pereira and i think it hast a lot to offer to foreign people even if it is not a cosmopolitan city. Everything is close.  Even the other cities, 1 hour drive to Manizales, one hour drive to Armenia, one hour drive to Cartago.   Pereira has very beautiful girls.  Pereira is also very near to natural attractions such as La Pastora,  Parque Nacional de Los Nevados (national park of snow mountains),  Cocora Valley (salento),  Termales San Vicente (hot springs in Santa Rosa de cabal).   Pereira had a zoo that recently became a biodiversity theme park called 'Ukumari' where you get to see exotic animals in free environment such as tigers,  elephants,  rhinos,  zebras as well as native rare animals like dantas.  Street food is cheep,  tasty and somewhat reliable.  If you go make sure you try a hot dog in 'avenida treinta de agosto', and to go and eat 'arepas de chocolo' in Cerritos. Hang out in via circunvalar' in the weekend and go to 'Parque arboleda'  if you want to see beautiful women.   Pereira is arguably the most developed city in the coffee region, so is a good place because you're near to the sightseeing places and landmarks but you also have zones to do shopping and that kind of stuff. Pereira has a lot of 'Casas cafeteras' that work as hotels so you can live the experience about how is produced one of the most famous coffee in the world."

Colombia,3a3j9g,matatigres,3,Sun Jun 21 12:36:15 2015 UTC,"I think your last point is most accurate. There are not a lot of touristy things in the area. At least nothing main stream, like, stuff you would see on travel shows. Also the city is statistically more dangerous. The homicide rate is over 3 times Bogota and Medellin. Also when you leave Cali, that region has a lot of trafficking and guerrilla activity. That does not mean that you would live in fear there, but it is something travellers consider"
Colombia,3a3j9g,insultmaestro,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:23:23 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input! Makes sense with how Cali is isolated by jungles. Since i am willing to accept the precautions and would like to get to know the country perhaps ill end up giving it a shot and going anyways.
Colombia,3a3j9g,insultmaestro,2,Wed Jun 17 05:13:54 2015 UTC,"Pereira is awesome, also a lot of cool nature stuff to do around there. Some of the best Arepas come from Pereira.

You and your SO should consider that to the majority of people who participate in carnival and many Barranquilleros consider it a week of debauchery, drinking, and casual sex. If I had to choose between spending an extra week with my SO in say, the coffee region or Amazon, or spending the week in Carnival, I would skip carnival 10 out of 10 times. My wife and I will spend our next Carnival in Medellin."
Colombia,3a1b1i,guacamaya,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:30:46 2015 UTC,I really only plan on being there for one or two days of the festivities and it is the sort of thing that you may only get to do once in a lifetime.

Debauchery sounds fun for a day but having a girlfriend for it all well.....
Colombia,3a1b1i,nicoleta_,2,Wed Jun 17 13:06:21 2015 UTC,"Colombia is a great place to visit and one month is the perfect amount of time to do it. First question you dont have to go to Peru to access the Amazon, you can do it from here but only on a plane and is not a cheap plane. The amazon is a place you must go is really worth it.   Second question. Those cities are not linear. You can start on Santa Marta then Baranquilla, Cartagena, Medellin, Manizales, Cali and Popayan, but to go to Bogota you have to take another route, however is only 8 hours in car from Medellin or Cali.  Places you should go hiking: Parque Natural Tayrona, Zona Cafetera, Valle del Cocora, Nevado del Ruiz, Parque Natural Purace, Parque Arqueologico San Agustin.  I have never been to the carnival i dont know about it. I f you have more questions you can PM me."

It's a lot cheaper than Avianca though so worth a look. I'd recommend adding in a visit to the Coffee Region, pretty sure it's a must-do while in Colombia. Contact some of the fincas themselves because you can stay there quite economically, otherwise there are hostels in towns like Salento."

Colombia,39n61e,Julitopen,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:52:56 2015 UTC,They switched every actor after the pilot. It is jarring since I liked the first episode a lot. The first guy played escobar well. The second guy is clumsy fat and just hard to watch. Somehow I picture escobar as inbetween.
Colombia,39n61e,DrYaguar,6,Sat Jun 13 01:55:09 2015 UTC,"Andrés Parra is one of the best actors in Colombia, and he played his Escobar part almost to perfection."
Colombia,39n61e,MVRH,2,Sat Jun 13 03:05:25 2015 UTC,The second actor is frequently highlighted for its accuracy in that role. Maybe you don't like the style but he is doing pretty well as an actor.
Colombia,39n61e,Dmorales0528,3,Wed Jun 17 06:01:29 2015 UTC,"First episode is him as a child, then they change to a teenager, then it goes to the older fatter version."

Colombia,38zu0p,dr_van_nostren,2,Mon Jun 8 05:33:29 2015 UTC,"Hey,  Yes, you need to get a visa for over 90 days if you want a cedula. I agree.... it's really annoying to be here without a cedula, but since you are only here for 8 weeks out of the year, I don't know if that's possible.  ""The holders of the visas whose duration exceeds three (3) months, as well as their beneficiaries, shall register at the foreigners’ registry of the Special Colombia Migration Administrative Unit within the fifteen (15) calendar days counted from their entry into the country or from the issuance date of the visa if it was issued in the national territory; or within the fifteen (15) days following their entry into Colombia if the visa was issued at a Consulate.""  So, this visit to migracion Colombia would be to get a visa. I have to mention that the cedula is only good for how long your visa is. I have one year contracts, so I have to get a new cedula every year. I live in Barranquilla and I've had to wait up to 7 months to get my cedula as well. Although, I imagine in other cities it's a bit more efficient. The last time only took me 3 months and I was estatic.   I don't know if you're eligible for this visa. I would imagine it's for people who need to apply for tourist visas as opposed to Canadians who don't need to apply before they arrive.  I would call the cancilleria. They have a 24 hour line and they were very helpful when I called them: Líneas de atención al ciudadano: Número gratuito nacional: 01 8000 938 000 - Bogotá: (57-1) 3826999  Good luck!"

The cedula comes along with the visa, which you must apply for within 15 days in a Migración Colombia office after your first entry in the country. The validity is same as the visa. Failing of applying results getting fined. The first visa must be obtain outside of Colombia, afterward you renew it in Bogota. Must be renewed before exceeding the validity, otherwise it's a big mess. Here you have the different visa: http://cancilleria.gov.co/tramites_servicios/visas One option could be ""Temporal especial - investigación de mercado""  But do not forget one thing, visa costs about USD 250 and the cédula itself USD 100, which you'll have to renew and pay the same amount of money each year."

Ultimately I'd like to live there and do some kind of work, but i guess until that day comes I'm just gonna have to keep being a tourist.  Stupid reciprocity tax!

Colombians are very clean, so like others said keep your room/bed spotless, but even more important, keep yourself and your clothes squeaky clean! Most Colombian households do not have a dishwasher or a dryer, helping out with those tasks is a plus.
