redorchestra,3dj3zw,Lemonater47,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:32:26 2015 UTC,"Badassery I suppose but if you look at it from a logical standpoint I think you wouldn't want the Katana, a type 38 with a type 30 bayonet would be in total 72.44 IN and thus an extremely efficient spear which if you speared an enemy and they kept moving you pull the trigger while the bayonet is in them. A Katana however wouldn't have an execution function, and is way too short (23 IN) to be a whole spear."

They don't have to be armed, but infantry shooting out the sides would be cool. The majority of helicopters flown in Vietnam were used for medevac or for resupply purposes. I can imagine the US having to advance over a long distance and having to rely on Hueys for supplies. As a long time sim pilot, I would love the chance to fly a helo even if it doesn't have guns that I can control. I did it all the time in battlefield Vietnam, and it was a real tactical advantage in that game because you could move troops very quickly. Alsoâ¦ Make no mistake. The UH-1 isn't the toughest bird to take down with small arms fire. All helicopters are pretty vulnerable to automatic weapons, actually. With everyone carrying assault rifles, balancing won't be too hard at all. Also, I'm sure the VC will make use of caves and tunnels, providing shelter from air support.

I'm sure everyone else knows this too but I really like the building that can be accessed from D where you can see down a long street that usually gets filled with players. I love being a machine gunner on this map.
redorchestra,3ddq2t,Memorizing_Fallout,4,Wed Jul 15 13:54:24 2015 UTC,"Kessel is a blast. If the attacking team falters on the first push they can be locked out of A by agressive defenders. It will take teamwork and good SLs to break through.  I like to try and take C next by using smoke and entering the far end of the cap. Once we have C you can get below the 'sniper building'. This gives a good position to cut off the defenders from B. Watch out for nades dropped from above, but I find this to be rather rare.  If you want to grenade the sniper house windows, be very careful and cook your nades for 2-3 seconds. You can get them inside with a little luck. Cooking them makes it so they explode in the air if they bounce off, might even get a kill."
redorchestra,3ddq2t,GeneralFeldMarschall,3,Wed Jul 15 13:57:05 2015 UTC,"Love the map, its a bit challenging if your team isn't coordinated enough (or the other team is more coordinated) and the defenders get to setup on A.  Depends. I'm an engineer whore so in that case I love feeling special by blowing open doors for the team.   Defending-rifleman. I lay down my life in any match for the team, and this is an intense map, who wouldn't want to be in the thick of it?  Attacking- be an engineer whore.   None other than coordinate! If the TL and SLs wont, get in a squad with those that will. You'd be impressed with what one solid squad can stand up to."
redorchestra,3ddq2t,Dharmottara,2,Wed Jul 15 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"When assaulting the first point on this map (Capture Point A), it is absolutely vital that the attacking team secure the second floor of the ruins ASAP. This can be achieved by having the majority of the team rush left staircase as soon as the match starts, as it is the most direct and safest route to the second floor. If the attackers are unable to secure the second floor quickly, it is very possible for the defenders to end the match at Point A, or at least whittle away enough reinforcement tickets to make victory a forgone conclusion.  After Point A has been secured, becomes somewhat of a toss up for both teams on which capture point to focus next. In general, the attackers want to avoid a tug-of-war with the defenders, in which they capture a point and it is immediately recaptured by the enemy. To avoid this, attacking team should leave behind small groups to deny or to at least delay enemy incursions into the point. The attackers also need to be mindful of which doors they blow open at Point B, as certain entry ways (if not exploited to their fullest early on), can be used by the enemy defenders to flank the attacker's spawn area.   The defenders need to ensure that they maintain control of the central building overlooking the main road and the trainyard passing through Point C and Point D. If an enemy SL1 or SL2 is able to take up residence in this building (either by sneaking though the tunnel that connects Point C and Point D, or by bum rushing from Point A), it usually spells doom for the defenders, as this allows the attacking team an easy way to cut off reinforcements from the defender's spawn area.   In general, I enjoy playing SL a lot on this map, a lot of sneaky places to hide to piss off the opposing team."

redorchestra,3ddq2t,lvl5dagon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:16:40 2015 UTC,Definitely one of the best maps in RO. When it came out for the original red orchestra mod it was easily the best designed map.  Generally the axis win with a good defence of assembly hall with an mg/sniper in the offices to cut down attackers coming from the warehouse forward spawn. The way they usually lose is trying to retake warehouse repeatedly and losing out on reinforcements.

The game has always been a little more axis focused in terms of balance (not necessarily because of better weapons but player preference). This so called ""Staxis"" (higher skilled players stack the Axis side) reached its peak when the Mg42 was released in a patch late 2014. Since then it got better but overall on all servers combined, Axis still win a little more. Hold melee button (doesn't work with anti tank rifles, machine guns) and sprint key to charge. Unfortunately Uraa charges are not used a lot since few players know that it has an actual benefit. In Rising Storm on the other hand, Banzai charges (same principle) are key to win as Axis. There is a basic tank tutorial, besides that you can use the ""Steam Workshop"" page in the main menu to set up a game with bots. I recommend doing that at least once before you take a tank role or commander to figure out the basics."

redorchestra,3d9zq5,Dharmottara,10,Tue Jul 14 17:58:37 2015 UTC,"In RO2 there are three types of levels you gain as you play: weapon level, honor level, and class level.  Weapon level is independent of the other two and is the most straightforward. You gain weapon experience with each kill you make with the weapon. Eventually you unlock different attachments or bonuses for each gun at certain weapon levels. All weapons can be leveled to a max level of 50, with bonuses coming at level 25 and/or level 50.   Honor level is basically your account level. All the experience you gain in a match (whether it be from kills or team related activities) feeds into this level. Your class level is tied to your honor level, which I will explain in the next paragraph. The range for honor levels is from level 10 to 99 (I believe all new players start automatically at level 10, honor level 0 is reserved for bots).    Class level is the level of each class you play in RO2, whether it be rifleman, engineer, or team leader, each class is leveled separately. Like honor levels, the experience fed towards your class level is derived from kill and team points. However, instead of incorporating total points per match, class level only takes into account experience earned while playing a specific class. Class levels are divided into six different ranks, and each rank can only be unlocked AFTER you have reached a certain honor level (listed below, taken straight from the RO2 wiki).  Raw Recruit (Default) Front-Line Soldier (Honor 20) Battle-Hardened (Honor 40) Veteran (Honor 50*) Highly Decorated (Last achievable rank, Honor 80 Needed) Hero (Available when joining a server, limited to specific numbers by the server)    By unlocking different class levels, you will unlock different weapon selections for that class. You will also unlock small overall performance bonuses to your character, like increased movement speed and suppression resistance. As u/aznmaster19 was pointing out, you will only unlock the MKb 42 (basically prototype StG 44) after you have reached honor level 60 AND have unlocked veteran class level for the elite assault class. Sorry for the long winded answer.  TL;DR You need to reach honor level 60 50* then unlock veteran class level for the elite assault class before you can select the MKb 42.  *Edit: Looks like the wiki information for veteran class level might be inaccurate, updated main post to reflect that. Possible some of the other information listed is also inaccurate, although I'm pretty sure highly decorated rank is indeed unlocked at honor level 80. Thanks for pointing out the mistake. I've been ""stuck"" at level 99 for awhile so I've forgotten the exact class level/honor level ratios."

But to be honest no matter how much you try and offer your advice and leadership to a team, sometimes it just wont work because there are a lot of beginners on the team.  I will say that a server that I was introduced to by a friend was some of the most high level games I've ever played in. That server is the VTG server. It's only russians there so there wont be much English, but best believe they are talking amongst themselves.  And even tho games like Dota, LoL, have made Russians out to be pretty toxic to the games, in RO2 this is not the case and I find that, at least on that server, people are very civilized and very much into winning and tactical and all that. I've had the most crazy close, epic games on VTG.  So that would be my recommendation besides the one you're already playing. But again, test all the server and see which one you like best. There are 2fg and merrils also are good server. But on some servers you might have a higher ping than you would like so it's really up to you."

Happens to me often as I like to hide and pick off enemies as they overrun a position. And yes, the game punishes you for being out of bounds by exploding your body.  The game gave you the kill because you were the last one to inflict damage on him. This ""last to inflict damage"" rule also applies if a player dies to fall damage (indicated by a ""person falling"" kill icon), or commits suicide via menu or console. The ""skull and cross bones"" kill icon is the game's miscellaneous kill icon, and you will only see it if you get a kill via enemy committing suicide or by them being out of bounds too long.  Edit: Thinking more about it, I believe satchel charge kills will also display ""skull and cross bones"" as the kill icon.  Edit Edit: And u/Soviet_Bear-ANV is correct, satchel charge kills give the arty kill icon."

Try not to use the in game cover mechanic, most people don't like it.  Don't rush headfirst towards a point but try to use flanks to push into it.  Our wait until a SL smokes an area and use the smoke to push up.  If you are new, you are probably playing the rifleman class, which you should be. You are basicly cannon fodder so dying its expected.   Just watch out for arty and if you are being shot at, go prone immediately and try and crawl towards cover or wait it out until the person shooting at you is killed or moved on.  If you are shooting from a window, don't stand directly in front of it but mine towards the back of the room to protect your flanks.  Playing this game isn't just about being an effective player, but also an effective team member. Calling out enemy positions, incoming artillery and open flanks and grenades will protect your team and save tickets. Capturing a point is more important than getting kills. Atleast from an attacking position. Defending is all about keeping bodies on the point and guarding entrances.  You can also carry more than one weapon. So if you have the chance, pick up an smg or semi auto or fully auto weapon as your secondary."
redorchestra,3cfjvo,Dirtydirtdirtt,7,Tue Jul 7 15:23:38 2015 UTC,"Sometimes people get sprint happy. Don't do that. Better to move a bit slower and be ready to shoot.  Try to keep your 'front' protected. Shoot around the edges of objects vs over them where possible.  Forget about headshots. Every single weapon in the game can kill with one shot to the chest. Rifles will almost never require a follow up shot for a good center of mass hit, SMGs and pistols may at range."

redorchestra,3cfjvo,BMRGould,6,Tue Jul 7 20:09:45 2015 UTC,"If you are just beginning, it's good to just play rifleman and learn the maps. That's very important. You can't play other roles effectively if you don't know the maps.  It's also highly advisable that you listen to your team leader, if he communicates that is.  Once you know the maps it will be easier to get into other roles because you will have seen where others in those roles camp. And you can emulate them.  You can also search on youtube for tips on RO2 as there are quite a few videos there to help newcomers. But don't get too hung up on tips and tricks and try to play the game and get a feel for it. Try as a rifleman to be in the capzone and help defend/capture. You also need to be careful when attacking as you die easily and there are usually 30+ players on the other team just waiting in position to kill you so you must be careful.  Use the flanks, take advantage of your TL's and SL's smoke.   And it doesnt hurt to play with bots from time to time to get a feel for the weapons or just play a custom game alone and just look at the map and just take a ride and see what the map is all about more in-depth."

redorchestra,3ccipg,SST_2_0,3,Tue Jul 7 14:55:56 2015 UTC,"Well there's ""Squad"" coming out, which is on Unreal Engine 4 and takes place in Afghanistan. I think people have figured out that Unreal is the perfect compromise between the great scale of the Arma engine (at the expense of clunky close quarters action and crappier physics) and the exceptional lag-free close quarters action of the Source engine (at the expense of WAY smaller levels, i.e., Peak in Insurgency or any CSGO map). If anyone remembers Berlin in Darkest Hour, it was a huge map that took an hour to play and spanned kilometers, but at every step of the way you were clearing building after building. Classic Red Orchestra, IMO."

Doubtful, IMO, being that RO2 games have always been more on the historical side... plus we already have Insurgency, as well as Squad on its way... modern US forces are pretty well covered.  Soviet war in Afghanistan... now that's a really interesting idea. Obviously it's a bit more modern than Vietnam (80s vs 60s-early 70s), but not terribly so. It also just seems like a wicked interesting conflict for a game."

I find it incredibly unlikely that Tripwire will think after releasing RS2: ""You know what, of all the wars we could cover in an expansion, take the most recent and still ongoing war and turn it into another game"".  The only way that this might actually happen is a dedicated modding team that puts so much effort into creating it that they will get hired by Tripwire.  Besides that, even if that would happen (0,1% chance if you ask me), it will not be ready before 2018.  If you want a game set in Afghanistan, Insurgency has certain maps. Project Reality for BF2, Arma 2/3 and Squad also feature a couple maps in Afgh, those games however don't have a lot in common with RO2/RS."

American pigs had pushed us back to the last set of bunkers before our company had failed their mission. We needed to act swiftley before all hope was lost. I decided to die with honor so I primed my grenade and ran into the bunker. Taken by surprise the American's simply watched me run past in disbelief (You will be surprised how often that happens). I stood there looking them in the eyes and by the time they started to train their rifles at me I had taken 4 lives with me.   I died with great honor. That day my company managed to hold off the assault long enough to delay the American push into our territory.   Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!

redorchestra,3c1rlt,Soviet_Bear-ANV,5,Sat Jul 4 17:21:50 2015 UTC,You use mouse scroll to select grenade. Then you click and hold down . When ready simply click and hold the mouse scroll button and it primes the grenade as you charge.   For traps you select grenades in the same manner . find a good spot like what the enemy uses as cover or high foot traffic areas then look at the ground and right mouse.   Both can be effective with practice. I played for a few weeks only trying to get kills by suicide grenade and ever since I know exactly where and when to charge etc. Great fun.

We had fought our way across the ravine and pushed the Bolshevick hordes into the forest. We began to fight our way into the forest preparing to push them back even further. Just we are pushing them back again we hear the cannons. All around me shells begin to fall. Somehow I survived the first barrage for a moment I am relieved to be alive and I give my thanks to God. I turn to my comrades only to see that my squad is dead... my friends are dead. I can hear the cannons sound again. There is nowhere to go, nowhere but forwards.   I pick up my rifle and charge just as the shells start to come down behind me. I survive the hail of gunfire and dive into a crater and find myself starting down the barrel of a Russian machine gun, fortunately he is as surprised as I am. I manage to react before he does and I drive my bayonet into his gut. I pick up his gun and put as much fire down range as I can. I've fired maybe 20 rounds when I hear a small clink. Mien Gott. Granata! Once again there is nothing to do but charge forwards. This time running for a small wooden foxhole. I take a round to the shoulder but I can not stop, to stop means to die. I make it to the foxhole and drive my steel into the back of the bastard hiding in there. Once again I pick up the bolshevik weaponry and lay down fire on the scum. I have killed more of these animals that I care to count by now, I am a one man army, I am the bringer of death to this eastern hell. I never even hear the rifle that takes my life, but I can feel the blood pouring into my lungs, see my vision going dark. Before the darkness takes me I hear my comrades rally and push through the hole I have made in the soviet lines. I have fulfilled my duty to the fatherland, I die knowing that we will win because of my sacrifice. I release myself to the darkness."

We all reload and gather right next to a doorway prepared to make the push together down towards the lower part of the map and clear it out. I am the first one out the door and i get stuck on rubble and im immediately shot in the face. My squad shits the bed and froze. They didn't talk or do anything until an assault trooper starts reading bible verses( i have no clue which one). He rushes out the doorway and the squad follows. They are pushing south and pick off a few germans who didn't expect a push. They end up cleaning up the map and two of the five survive.
