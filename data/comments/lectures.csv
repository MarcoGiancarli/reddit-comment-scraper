lectures,3dsr56,andrejevas,3,Sun Jul 19 02:33:41 2015 UTC,"I also am pretty disappointed with this lecture. I more-or-less enjoyed his book True Illusions some time ago, but I find this presentation is a logical and factual mess. For example, abusing the term ""fractal"" to refer to supposed repeating patterns at different scales, such as solar systems being planets revolving around suns as comparable to atoms being electrons revolving around nucleus is rather sophomoric (not to mention actually physically wrong and outdated). There were a bunch of things like this, but I can't remember them right now. But for me they really undermined the thesis. (Though I did listen to the whole lecture.)"

It's evident to basically anyone, so it's not a unique observation; but, I don't think there's an explanation for it either, and scientists study much more mundane things.  Oh, sorry reread your comment. You were only talking about the idea of the atom. Was that even well known back in 1998 or whenever this was recorded?"

I think the word you're looking for is ""subjective""; which is, honestly, part of the point of the lecture.  At least use a direct quote and your issue with it next time so I don't have to fight a strawman."
lectures,3dsr56,gtechIII,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:53:01 2015 UTC,"I paraphrased. He does say that though, hone in near the beginning of the tape when he's first introducing novelty. He groups love in on the statement. In the same paragraph he mentions science only being able to explore 'defined' fields. I'm too lazy to go further. Reader check out his wikipedia page if you think this guy has a shot. I doubt it will sway the OP though."
lectures,3dsr56,dielon108,2,Sun Jul 19 11:58:45 2015 UTC,The bit on novelty was kind of just a tangent (as McKenna is prone to) as an example of his personal model or belief system outside of what nihilistic materialism or theism has dictated down to us.  The point of the lecture is as titled. Stop blindly following ideologies  and cultural norms and think for yourself. Kind of a good idea if you ask me considering we're pretty well set up for thermonuclear war or environmental collapses. McKenna's prescription for getting people to abandon their cultural conditioning is psychedelics because of the speed they can get people to reevaluate their belief system.  No where in the main premise is there any metaphysics or spooky magic.
lectures,3dsr56,gtechIII,2,Tue Jul 21 14:36:30 2015 UTC,"McKenna's cosmological theory of novelty has been handily disproven. His zero wave function which was predicted by that theory concluded a doomsday in 2012 which obviously did not come to pass. Even so, nihilism is not intrinsic to materialism. In fact nihilism isn't even the prevailing philosophy of our society, but that's simply an example of a mistake and not an argument for the mainstream. He uses metaphysics in order to justify his recommendations to jettison all modern culture.   McKenna is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Materialism does not preclude any of the prevailing philosophies and societal structures of the times; not capitalism, or socialism, or communism, or anarchism.   His idea that psychedelics enables one to see the world more clearly flies in the face of the research. I love psychedelics, LSD is by far and beyond my favorite drug, but I have no delusions that my clarity of thought is compromised while I'm on them. Psylocybin's main method of action is the temporary suppression of your most robust neural networks. Much like alcohol disrupts the function of the physical seats of coordination, executive function, and impulse control. This is why, for one example, when you're on shrooms your ability to see faces is difficult. Facial recognition is one of the most robust neural networks in the brain. There is an argument that the suppression of your most deeply seated views are suppressed during these trips, and thus are easier to challenge, but the trade off is your ability to challenge them with critical fidelity is also greatly compromised.  McKenna makes his case for moving back to aboriginal values, in part with shamanism(which I've taken a crack at above), as well as the claim that we are in the most violent times in human history. This is incorrect, I'll let Pinker make my case here: http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_on_the_myth_of_violence# .  McKenna rails against culture. Aboriginal values are a culture, so is the free love movement, so is any particular type of spiritualism. Cultures are a collection of memes. A meme's main function is self propagation, benefiting its host is incidental to that benefit's tendency to propagate the meme. I agree, look at the world through fresh eyes, critically examine the memes you are exposed to and choose which ones you will take on. Mckenna's primary mistakes are 'any modern set of memes are flawed in total', and that 'one cannot pick and choose which memes contained in a culture are favorable'.  Human society today is a deplorable mess by some metrics, but it's better than it ever has been on average and we may just survive our current folly by progressing."
lectures,3dsr56,dielon108,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:56:54 2015 UTC,"I have never taken psychedelics, but have become interested after listening to a few of McKenna's lectures and reading about some of the positive effects. In your opinion was the experience worth the trouble?  I'm not about to burn down the cities and go live as a bush man (even if the idea does bring a smile to my face), but I still embrace McKenna's message of living without an Operating System, or at least   with my own operating system. I don't think it necessarily means throwing out any sort of baby. I think they even bring up Aboriginal values as a culture in the Q and A. Realistically the only way I could see removing your cultural values entirely would be to wipe your memory. I think the idea is rather to accept that they could all be bullshit. Obviously some people reach this without drugs, but from my reading of history a lot of terrible things have happened in the name of some glorious infallible god/king/empire/utopia. In fact the nearest we came to nuclear war was from a bunch of people who clearly took themselves too seriously. Then there's the issue of climate change which has me the most concerned.  I'm aware humanity is doing better day by day. I wouldn't waste my time with such things if I din't think humanity was worth saving."
lectures,3do99s,Schlagv,2,Fri Jul 17 22:01:07 2015 UTC,"Jean-Marc Jancovici is a famous French engineer working on energy strategy. He does talks about a very grim subject with a lot of humour.  He has an outstanding way of explaining energy and how incredibly wealthy we are, by comparing what machines and slaves can do.  He then talk about how economics and society and energy works together.  He ends with great explaination of the kind of gigantic changes that 2°C of warming means.  This is the first time he made a talk in English, so now the non-French speaking work can hear his nice story on Youtube!"
lectures,3do99s,Ketsa,2,Fri Jul 17 22:06:18 2015 UTC,I always seen this guy as the nuclear industry's best PR in France.
lectures,3do99s,cuntRatDickTree,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:00:15 2015 UTC,"Yep. As solar is becoming viable in countries with lots of sun as the price falls exponentially, he will have to change his rethoric. Solar+batteries are still not viable. But I doubt wind will get much better with the current form factor, you cannot make a giant steel tube much cheaper.  What I really like is how he explains energy and its social impact. I never saw this made as intuitive as he does.  Also, he is not a nuke PR guy when he says that all the oil is used in transports and that we don't know how to replace it. He also says that batteries are not renewable so electric cars are not as great as some say. He also says that electric cars are not zero carbon if you make coal electricity. So he is quite critical of electric cars despite such cars being a good way for nuclear producers to sell more electricity.  My main criticism is not his pro-nuclear stance, but his lack of faith in technological progress of the exponential technologies.  Like many non-Silicon Valley technocrats, he thinks the world in 2050 will be like today. This is his big mistake. Self driving cars and trucks will change transport and logistics. Google and Amazon are the big players here. This will radically transform the cities and save a lot of CO2."
lectures,3do99s,personer3,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:33:06 2015 UTC,"Self driving will reduce emissions quite a lot (I imagine, with the roads being much more efficient it could be a fairly big impact), but enough to offset our impact on climate change by a life-saving quantity? We will also need other major changes that we totally can't forsee yet.  I personally think it's completely impossible without the move to more local sustainability. Right here, the majority of the food on the shelves is imported from far away, just because there isn't a proper information system to get local suppliers in (supermarket deals, big business, etc, is all ruining the essential changes that we need otherwise we are going to have a terrible future), shit, independant greengocers/butchers are cheaper, and they re-invest locally (so less flying lamb and beef, frozen and ruined no less, across the hemispheres, vegiterianism is the biggest impact anyone can reasonably have on their carbon footrpint but that's not due to transport) instead of exporting profits untaxed... and you don't have that huge pile of glossy waste packaging.  Another odd thing, self-driving will only get that carbon reduction if the roads are only self driving, and if there isn't a chance of pedestrians stepping into the road (deterministic prediction is what would allow massive carbon reductions due to more efficient road use). So really, it's a kind of rail network without rails at that stage.  What were the prospects of ever using hydrogen engines? I am aware this requires much electricity but that could come from greener sources and then the hydrogen is easier to transport than wind/solar currents and it means no giant batteries too. Even if it's more scientifically viable, I can't see the public consensus getting behind it because for some reason ""electric"" is now a buzz word for ""clean and green""."
lectures,3do99s,DarthHarper,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:13:07 2015 UTC,The issue of hydrogen is that a lot of energy is lost during the transformation from electricity to hydrogen and then again in the thermal engine.  Battery requires a lot of initial investment but then you have a nearly lossless system. Electric engines are cheap and very efficient.  Elec -> (loss) -> Hydrogen -> Thermal engine (big loss) -> motion  vs  Elec -> Battery -> Electric engine -> motion
lectures,3do99s,fjafjan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:06:58 2015 UTC,"My main criticism is not his pro-nuclear stance, but his lack of faith in technological progress of the exponential technologies.   That's because having faith in technology to save us from our fossil fuel addiction is like someone having faith in Jesus to protect him from getting mugged while walking in Detroit in the middle of the night.   Like many non-Silicon Valley technocrats, he thinks the world in 2050 will be like today. This is his big mistake. Self driving cars and trucks will change transport and logistics. Google and Amazon are the big players here. This will radically transform the cities and save a lot of CO2.   I personally have no doubt that the world in 2050 will be drastically different today.  Surely by then, technology will have thought of newer, clever ways to turn fossil fuels into goods and services.  I do however doubt that we will find a renewable equivalent of fossil fuels by then, or ever.  Rapid technological progress has always been predicated on having available a basically unlimited source of usable energy.  When it comes to ""inventing"" sources of energy, we are currently quite unsuccessful in creating something that has a significant EROEI.  And we can't just extrapolate fossil-fuel-predicated technological progress to predict our success in the renewable-energy field, nor can we have faith in technological progress to create portable fusion reactors with which we can drive our cars to work.  Constant technological progress is not a universal law, but the principles of thermodynamics and physics are."
lectures,3do99s,spacefarer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:11:44 2015 UTC,"On principle, solar panels require barely no materials. It can be nanometer thin.  The issue is the process to make the panel and the storage to have electricity when we want.  If we keep making progress on panels, we will reach a moment when we will have lots of cheap energy but much more expensive storage.  This gives many opportunities to do great things with electricity intensive processes especially CO2 to carbon, to fix climate change. We know how to do it but the electricity cost is prohibitive today."

lectures,3dl5r1,Kosmozoan,3,Fri Jul 17 03:58:44 2015 UTC,"Speaking as an atheist, I gotta say this felt like a huge /r/atheism circlejerk (and that's not at all a good thing).  He just spends forty minutes wanking about how famously virtuous historical figures (e.g. Mother Teresa) were really not so saintly. But there's no punchline. There's no analysis or explanation of what that means. It's just ""HAHA LOOK THEY'RE FAKES!""   Even when he gets to the end of his tirade on that topic, he still can't muster any original thoughts. It's all standard fare for militant atheist self-congratulation.   Basically this speech lacks any insight whatsoever. It's ideological masturbation, and you shouldn't waste your time with it (and again, that's coming from an atheist, so it's not just that I don't like him or what he's got to say)."
lectures,3dl5r1,spacefarer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:12:57 2015 UTC,"I must say I (mostly) disagree. The point of his attack on famously revered cultural figures was a point about the broader dangers of worshipping any individual, however admirable they may seem or are portrayed--and that includes atheist  figureheads such as Dawkins, Dennett, Hitchens (whom at one point he even refers to as 'an asshole' at times)...etc. At least thats what I interpreted it as saying.     Furthermore, Andrews also goes on (assuming you watched the who thing) to stress the insignificance of the term ""atheist"" in describing someone; he even goes on to mock the idea that not believing in god necessarily means someone is rational or intelligent or honest, in pointing out that there are plenty of atheists who also believe in the illuminati, or that 9/11 was a conspiracy, or in the legitimacy of alternative medicines....etc. Yes, there were moments of 'preaching to choir' so-to-speak (it was a freethought convention after all) but overall I'd say it was provocative talk well-worth watching in light of this."
lectures,3dl5r1,spacefarer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:06:09 2015 UTC,"At least thats what I interpreted it as saying.    Right. That's what I mean.  You had to interpret his presentation of facts, because he provided no interpretation of those facts.  That's a failure of communication, or a failure of understanding.  In either case, it makes for a poor talk.   he even goes on to mock the idea that not believing in god necessarily means someone is rational or intelligent   Right.  But that's pretty standard fare.  If you're at all familiar with atheist communities/ideas, all of this is old hat.  Though I will concede it's not exactly ""militant,"" so I did make a poor word choice there.   Basically my objection to this talk is it's not information dense.  It contains only a few facts that aren't common knowledge (e.g. the specifics about Mother Teresa's work), and no new ideas at all.  If he'd fit that into 8 minutes, I'd say it's worth it. But at 40 minutes, he's wasted my time."

lectures,3dgvl6,TDaltonC,10,Thu Jul 16 15:40:16 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. The idea that we are taught to ""earn"" our place in the world, which never quite comes, fits nicely into the elite's desire to have us born landless and to ""earn"" our right by exchanging a lifetime of labour for a fraction of their birthright."

He expresses that it is a myth to believe we are a fluke in the universe and contrasts it with a symptom (as an apple is a symptom of an apple tree). Is he proposing determinism rather than random chance?
lectures,3dgvl6,seymorevenue,5,Thu Jul 16 15:52:43 2015 UTC,http://youtu.be/ZUPt77S_hJk  This is a talk he was invited to give to ibm engineers 1969. He fully addresses your question. He was an amazing thinker and friends with Bertrand Russell. He's in no way anti science.
lectures,3dgvl6,Knosis,3,Thu Jul 16 16:15:54 2015 UTC,"That was a great talk. I especially liked the portion he discusses the brain and how the ""field"" knowledge is far more powerful than linear since this is what I work on with AI. However, I didn't see how it answered my question.  I'd like to hear him discuss determinism directly because his thoughts are along the line that all is one and therefore objects we separate are actually symptoms of the same thing and this correlates with deterministic thought, but I feel would find issues within deterministic thinking."
lectures,3dgvl6,seymorevenue,6,Thu Jul 16 17:34:38 2015 UTC,"I'll do my best to answer this:  he believes that the myth of being a fluke in the chaotic cosmos is a ""put down"" on life, and was used against the myth of creationism based on an autocratic god.  But both are equally detrimental to people, and ultimately self-serving for the powers that be.  He instead is trying to allow people to entertain the idea that you're here because you want to be, and are not an accidental result of blind process, but instead you ARE the process itself, going all the way back to the big bang.  Essentially, he's saying you're god, but so is everyone else, and that life is not as serious as religion/society wants you to think.  He's, ""sincere, not serious.""   Edit: quotes added"
lectures,3dgvl6,gdubbz,4,Thu Jul 16 20:52:04 2015 UTC,"You should reference the quote at the end, Alan Watts flat out says he is ""Sincere but not Serious"" which is a conundrum considering they are synonyms in a modern thesaurus.  I think you hit the nail well but you could tie back into the science and less of the religion. Creationism leads itself to a kind of determinism and the fluke notion of modern science is much more about quantum and a niavity about the nature of evolution (e.g. what are the ""pressures"" that drive evolution more fundamentally). If you look at Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's Christogenesis this will match well with Alan's ideas and in general the idea here is a kind of supreme love that pushes evolution. Thus as Alan would say we are a continuation of the big bang and that life is shaped as it is for us to come into being, he would point to this being the true nature of cosmological evolution, that the universe is losing itself for itself, in a kind of self-refinement. He draws on this idea in particular from Hindu concepts of God and mentions it in other lectures.   I think we agree though, the real point is that things are not accidents, at least not from our perspective which is the humane perspective he would wish people to hold. He humorously points this idea as being akin to God, that our divinity is only realized in embracing our humanity (which is perhaps where his ideas become more Christian in nature versus the large amounts of eastern philosophy he brings to discussion)."
lectures,3dgvl6,Why_is_that,2,Fri Jul 17 00:45:04 2015 UTC,"The lecture you are looking for in particular is the boat analogy:  Alan Watts -- Living in the Present (Boat Analogy)  This particular lecture does get a bit more into spiritual statements (e.g. stating the serpent was an angel, and thus understands time greater than humans) but Alan's perspective about living in the present, is that it's the only way to escape determinism. I believe I touched a good bit on this in my other reply but the gist is Alan denies linear thought and ultimately points to the idea that much of our reasoning is built on determinism such that it inhibits our freedom. Alan does believe in spontaneity but only in it manifesting out of living in the present. He is essentially denying the helpfulness of our reason and how it ""sets us up"" for failure but at the same time will point to the capacity to understand vast aspects of the universe simply be being fully in the moment -- that is, if we could fully breathe in the moment, then we would understand all that had to be to form the universe, simply because the evolution of the cosmos isn't a process that has stopped but continues in our hearts, as much as it does on the edge of space, as this accelerating universe expands into the ""void"". So too, by touching the void within (breaking from our educated reason), can we really have a profound, enlightening, experience.  If your in AI, you might like to watch the movie Plug & Pray.

lectures,3dgvl6,Gorgonaut666,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:16:35 2015 UTC,"I think if you watched the video once and for the first time, it may take a few more rounds before you get the full depth of his ideas. Above, I point to one of his talks on Karma and Determinism (called the boat analogy). This may make more clear his denial of determinism and where he believes free will/action arises.  To add a bit more, he connects to karma in that karma is a kind of determinism where by our form is shaped by forms previously lived. Yet, if you follow any Buddhism, Siddhartha ultimately outlines that one can break free of their karma and this is the path of enlightenment. This is what Alan points to without saying, how does one become enlightened and how does it relate to how we ""reason"" or experience the world."
lectures,3dgvl6,Why_is_that,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:04:27 2015 UTC,"He is not proposing determinism. In fact, much of his talk up until that point is calling light to false dichotomies in saying they are myths. Both to believe in a quantum world or a deterministic world is a myth -- both are a fluke and an illusion. I will address this two fold by pointing to how modern science self-contradicts on this regard and how Alan points to the issue (and why/how he is equipped to do so).  First, Alan points to the issue by reflecting on a simple truth illuminated in Buddhism or other practices that focuses on the breathe. By breathing we notice we breath in and out but as he points out, am I really breathing in the universe or is the universe breathing out me? Thus the systematic thinking of the ""Western World"" is built in the scientific understandings of reason which of foremost needs to have light drawn on concepts like Gödel's incompleteness theorems. Gödel is a great mathematician around the period of both Einstein and Watts but illuminates a great pitfall in our system of understanding which is that axiomatic systems are either incomplete or inconsistent. They either fail to speak to all the true states or they falsely identify something (saying it is true when false or vice versa). We find simular issues in ""reasoning"" throughout all science. Alan Watts understands this issue not because he is scientifically literate (of which he is decent in his time) but rather because of Buddhism and certain etymology. In other lectures he will point to the words Maya and Mara that stand for both illusion and demon respectively but both share the root ""ma"" to measure. In this way, the Buddhism begins to line up with Quantum to point to this idea that the world (wave) collapses into mere illusions via measurement but the beauty of the signal is beyond these mere demons and illusions. In fact, in this understand evil comes into existence by the very act of measuring and thus if we don't see the world in good vs evil (a measurement), then life just is, and these ideas dissipate.   Now to outline how modern science contradicts itself. As you are pointing out the issue here is determinism. As Einstein said it, ""God doesn't play with dice"", and thus many people have a prejudice for determinism even though quantum mechanics is really showing that things are fundamentally the outcome of a series of chances (dice rolls). Science contradicts itself in that modern physicists argue there is no free will (and thus the outcome is sociologically/psychologically deterministic). They say before you even think you have made a choice, an impulse is fired in the brain and there begins this chain of causality (which really begins a long time before). Watts points to this issue too by saying that we blame our parents and they blame theirs before... after all we know no matter how ""free"" we are, we are told we will inherit the worst qualities of our parents -- so is there really any free will? This is the silliness Alan points to, that by saying things were caused by a fluke, we have forced ourselves to act a certain systematic way and that in doing so, we have reduced to the supreme nature of our being, we have destroyed our potential for divinity by denouncing free will/spirit and saying that everything works like a cog. Another angle to this is to really think about what matters in a quantum world. In a quantum world, all these events are happening with some chance but the path of causality that leads to humanity developing is one in countless of these possible parallel worlds and to think about those others worlds is to gain no insight into the actual moment that exists because the events that have lead to you formation are exactly so, such that you could form as you have. Physicists even argue about this issue in that if you could see from ""God's perspective"" you can know the chance of all the different formulations for the universe but for you, living in this universe, the chance is 1 -- it was bound to happen, else how could you form. Thus Alan points to multiple break downs in scientific thought that belittle the human experience, limiting it's potential instead of really illuminating the true nature of the universe and how/why it formed as it has. He says this most poetically by saying we are the energy of the big bang and that our beauty lies in that we are a continuation of that energy. He sometimes states the science but goes beyond to illuminate what it really shows about the human condition and how we are shaped not just by the evolution of the universe but by the formulation of our models (and we should know well the quote ""All models are wrong""). Alan, like Einstein, challenges the status quo and in doing so doesn't make a scientific statement but a spiritual or sociological statement. Einstein has a great quote that I cannot find right now which outlines that science fails in that it can describe what you should do once you have a value system but never says what value system we should have to begin with. This is what Alan points to, he riddles us about what is valuable, just as the self-immolating monk does so, and he will even admit it, he is not peaching, he is a Jester, a comedian.   In conclusion, I love Alan's words because I love Einstein's and Einstein makes the brilliant statement, ""If it isn't first absurd, it's hopeless"". Einstein understands that truly profound questions, break the model and thus he made the profound discover that it wasn't time staying constant but rather light. Similarly, Alan Watts points to a notion that the universe is neither wholly chance nor pure determinism (something that as we better understand quantum gravity and the nature of ""observation"" in the quantum world will be better understood).   TLDR He is purposing neither but instead pointing out the weakness in seeing the world in only binary or false dichotomy.  EDIT: I think he also at times might be poking fun of linear thought here but would have to re-watch it with that idea in mind to state better."

Isn't it the people who went to college that are ultimately responsible for the internet being used to pass this information? What is his solution to all this?  I find this childish and expect it from a teenager. From the point of view of an adult who has bills to pay this is just dumb. Its obvious, not smart.

lectures,3dgvl6,Maestrotx,16,Thu Jul 16 22:18:27 2015 UTC,"My interpretation of what he is saying is to not be fooled by the carrot that society continually holds just out of your grasp as you go through life.

To travel is to be alive, but to get somewhere is to be dead, for as our proverb says, 'To Travel well is better than to arrive.'"" This is a direct quote from Alan in one of his books.  However, I slightly disagree in that I think he is also pointing to a society built on busy work which is a kind of ""making jobs for jobs shake"". He mocks our whole value system, not just our monetary system but he also says no culture appears to be different in this regard (saying the problem exists in both Japan and the US). We can accept the individual truth (the easiest to bear) that we shouldn't chase the carrot but there is a socialogical truth that society is lost by dangling carrots. He points to both issues but ofcourse, the former is the easier take home, as the latter is a riddle about how we make this world a home for all."
lectures,3dgvl6,Why_is_that,4,Fri Jul 17 06:35:55 2015 UTC,"...i suggest you underestimate the astute social commentary present in Carlin's writing -- or in Fincher's recent Gone Girl, for that matter. Watts is digging beneath the first layer or two of the societal fabric, and illuminating elements that lead people to simply follow the ebb and flow as if asleep, consuming and creating the same patterns without any self-awareness -- certainly, little movement beyond the ego.  i like Watts. Zen is something that also contains pearls if you've got the gumption to dig. i prefer the genius of DT Suzuki (1875 - 1969) -- who wrote more than 50 books in both his native Japanese and in sparkling English. He illuminates this quandary better than any writer i know.  This question of, ""Well, what do you expect us all to do? Are we all just going to float through life like hippies (or, insert favourite sterotype here) "",  is not an effective dismissal of these ideas. It is simply the first layer, or two, of the mind defending itself and its paltry position, status, and information.   Our society is in peril. Our corporate societal core, now mixing again with militarism, is a most dangerous game. If we do not manifest change, we will see the grim details in our lifetimes, and our children will - largely - inherit a world where seas, soil, and skies are not fit.  So people such as Watts raise relevant questions even though our era is much different than when he was active as a zen rock n roll star -- and a talented one, at that."

Your comment is ""nothing new"" but yet you squirm over Alan's riddles, ""how could such a new world come"", well it starts by you dieing (physically or metaphysical) and like the great Max Planck says, "" a new scientific truth doesn't triumph by convincing it's opponents the light but because a new generation grows up with familiarity and an old generation dies out"".  Alan doesn't just say the system is a ruse but the money itself and that's where your arugement is self destructive. You think the system can continue to progress at this rate and while doing so the monetary system remains it's valudity. These systems have collapsed in the past and to believe they will last forever is to suck the very religious tit of capitalism. Its bull shit, greed and self intrest isn't the way of the world.

lectures,3d6oo9,Organiczygote,3,Tue Jul 14 12:48:06 2015 UTC,"Resource allocation is a really difficult problem in a mature economy. That's my main problem with Peter Joseph's ideas. He tends to glaze over that part, even though it's the most important part of a new economic system.      One could make a strong argument that inefficient resource allocation is the main reason communism has performed so poorly. In the beginning communism works quite well, because resource allocation is obvious. Modernize agriculture, industrialize manufacturing, standardize education, motorize transports, expand infrastructure, etc. It's when you don't know what to build anymore that it becomes tricky. The position is similar to where Apple is right now. They've had solid success in the past, but where do they go from here? What's the next big thing? Nobody knows.      In that sense, a market economy is like a squid with thousands of tiny arms - where each arm represents entrepreneurs, trailblazers, 'really stubborn people', but also a few government projects, charities and non-profits. A planned economy tends to have much fewer arms, often with a few giant ones that the political leadership touts as ""the arm to end all arms"" or ""the arm that will solve all problems"". As history has shown, large arms tend to be amazingly wasteful endeavors. But the tiny arms of the market economy are also wasteful. Most of them fail to find a way to support themselves. Thankfully they are a dime a dozen for a mature economy and easily affordable.      The problem the many tiny arms solves, is to find the projects that we didn't know deserved our resources (or to find Apple's ""next big thing™""). We are not good enough at predicting the future to know about these projects beforehand. That's why we can't afford to bet our future on a few big ideas, no matter how promising they might look. If a company fails, it's not such a big deal. If a country fails, we get civil war, famine, human misery and tofu ice cream.

This particular lecture is 1 hour and 7 minutes, the remaining time being used for a Q&A.  I haven't seen one of his lectures yet that wasn't worth the time, and this is one of the better ones.  If you haven't watched a Chomsky lecture before, or if you are light in the pants on history, I suggest that you break it up into blocks of 10 or 15 minutes, with breaks in between, maybe even watching a section per day, and then watch the Q&A, which isn't so dense as the lecture.  Treat it like a tv series or a class.  Have a notepad handy.  Again, it is very dense stuff.  He doesn't stop for air, and he makes many references to historical events, names, places, articles, and books.  Take time to think about and research what he has to say.  I think you'll be hard pressed to find a speaker who has so much down to earth historical knowledge and insight, into why things are they were they are, to pass along.  Just remember that you are watching it to become informed, and it might take a little while to process it all.  Don't let the length of the video and density of information within scare you away.

If it wasn't so damn dense in context and phraseology then I would post this is /r/whoadude   Even as a relatively open minded person listening only half way thru my thoughts are this is too much, now return to nihilistic beliefs b/c in the grand scheme you were outplayed before you were even born."

The reason the elites and wealthy are so conscious of class issues is that if the population wakes up, they can very easily seize power.  We do live in a democracy.  All it takes is like 1/3 people going to the polls and voting for someone outside of the normal two parties."
lectures,3d13zk,Vellon221,0,Sun Jul 12 20:46:48 2015 UTC,"This I do I believe is possible though do imagine 5 generations of preparation versus 1 generation of awakening...a new world war minus nukes would only assist an already effective war propaganda machine. Fear of unexpected death would negate an movement towards a more egalitarian society. I will and do vote, I feel the Berns, BUT trying to rationalize the power struggle l see a stacked deck."
lectures,3d13zk,St_OP_to_u_chin_me,4,Sun Jul 12 21:18:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure what a world war has to do with organizing socially and voting outside of the incumbent parties.  Simply acknowledging the stackedness of the deck means we can overcome it.  It would be nice to vote in a president that is truly for the people, but it is far more feasible to start at the local level, such as with Kshama Sawant.  Organizing ourselves and acknowledging we can actually make a change is the first step.  Even within this video Chomsky talks about how increased awareness and protests have influenced the military industrial complexes actions."

I do recall his history lesson on 'PR' beginning in the public sector in the build up and push into the First World War. And given our American track record of global aggression/resource protectionism, it seems the use of global conflict to rally the public into confining debate within predetermined conditions and premises. Directing/control/influence public discourse is paramount to the totalitarian democracy we are in."

After that, if you feel that you need something more hopeful to read or watch as a followup, I'll be glad to point you toward something worth your time.  I understand your point of view, and I think it is probably more common than some of us would like to admit.  If this is your intro to these ideas, it is heavy stuff."
lectures,3d13zk,semitarian,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:06:20 2015 UTC,"WOW, I’d really like to discuss w/ people the things I watch here on r lectures but I’m not going to invest trying to appear as a ‘talking head’ for this community just for points worthless points. People on this sub tend to post too scientifically. Can’t someone just throw their thoughts out there w/o being belittlement? Maybe other would listen to a young Noam and notice his tone is more dire in his younger years? I mean, I watched the recent link on existentialism and the professor definitely touched on the prevalence of nihilism in Western society and here I am experiencing this lecture, considering the ideas put forth, and BAM thoughts of nihilism are invoked. I see these things as relevant, real, meaningful and yet if I’m not attempting to portray myself as a PHD or graduate student writing an essay then your just not up to snuff for /r/lectures. I just spent 5 five hours on work at a cafe, OT, its 130am..."
