I created a thread in botsrights to celebrate your existence.  Then I realized that each comment was a little customized for the subreddit or thread in which you were posting, which means you're either an amazingly amazing bot, or you're a person.  And then there is this :   You need to harm children to produce child pornography, but once it's done you can see and copy it with no harm done to anyone, it's the only scenario where piracy is 100% good, not only because it helps the consumers, but also because in this case it fucks the producers, which is good in this case.   IMHO that is a naïve and dangerous opinion, and if you've been on reddit any length of time, it leads me to believe that you're likely trolling in some way."

snowden,3bfxw4,cojoco,5,Sun Jun 28 21:46:57 2015 UTC,"Text:  The Obama administration disclosed this month that for the past year China had access to the confidential records of four million federal employees. This was the biggest breach ever—until the administration later admitted the number of hacked employees is at least 18 million. In congressional testimony last week it became clear the number could reach 32 million—all current and former federal workers.  The Chinese hackers managed to gain “administrator privileges,” allowing them full access to the computers of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Among other things, they were able to download confidential forms that list “close or continuous contacts,” including those overseas—giving Beijing a new tool to identify and suppress dissenters.  That’s not the worst of it. The administration disclosed a separate intrusion that gave Beijing full access to the confidential background-check information on federal employees and private contractors who apply for security clearances. That includes the 4.5 million Americans who currently have access to the country’s top secrets. The potential for blackmail is chilling.  Since 1996 the Defense Department has considered 18,272 appeals from contractors whose security-clearance applications were denied. Decisions in these cases are posted, without names, on a Pentagon website under the heading “Industrial Security Clearance Decisions.” These are detailed case assessments on whether these individuals can be trusted or whether something in their background disqualifies them. China now knows who they are.  One man kept his security clearance despite admitting a 20-year affair with his college roommate’s wife, about which his own wife was unaware. Another accessed pornography on his work computer and didn’t tell his wife “because he feels embarrassed by his conduct.” Another admitted shooting his teenage son in the leg. Other cases detailed spousal abuse, drugs, alcoholism, tax evasion and gambling.  OPM director Katherine Archuleta tried to dodge blame for the security lapses. “I don’t believe anyone is personally responsible,” she told a Senate committee last week. “If there’s anyone to blame, it’s the perpetrators.”  That’s bunk. It’s normal for governments to spy on each other. “If I, as director of the CIA or [National Security Agency], would have had the opportunity to grab the equivalent in the Chinese system, I would not have thought twice,” Michael Hayden, who has headed both agencies, told a Wall Street Journal conference this month. “So this is not shame on China. This is shame on us for not protecting that kind of information.” Current director of national intelligence James Clapper said last week: “You kind of have to salute the Chinese for what they did.”  What can the U.S. do to limit the damage to people with clearances and national security? One inevitable consequence is that U.S. intelligence and law enforcement will enhance the monitoring of Americans with security clearances, including their digital and telephonic communications. Millions of patriotic Americans entrusted with national secrets are going to lose much of their privacy because their government was unable to protect their confidential personnel records.  That loss of privacy dwarfs the hypothetical risks from the NSA that have dominated the headlines about intelligence and surveillance in recent years. The Edward Snowden leaks distracted Washington from the pressing challenge of using intelligence better to prevent foreign hacking of Americans—a challenge only the NSA has the range of tools to meet.  The Obama administration passively endured years of cyber attacks leading to these most recent hacks. It only reluctantly named North Korea as the culprit in the hacking of Sony Pictures. A federal prosecutor indicted five Chinese military hackers, but the defendants remain safe in China. Mr. Obama got authority to order Treasury Department sanctions against anyone involved in a cyber attack that poses a “significant threat” against the U.S. or an American company, but he has not used the power.  Mr. Clapper says it’s time for the U.S. to get tougher by outlining in advance what the U.S. response will be based on the seriousness of a hacking incident. He proposes specific punishments for crossing various hacking “red lines.” The downside is that nobody believes this administration when it speaks of red lines.  Americans expect their government to protect them in the digital, as much as the physical, world. The next president should accept the responsibility to fight back against cyber war before more is lost."
snowden,3bfxw4,kutuzof,7,Sun Jun 28 21:47:50 2015 UTC,It'd actually be kinda awesome if the NSA was tasked with actual cyber security. They could force ISP to encrypt all traffic.

snowden,3bfxw4,FluentInTypo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:08:20 2015 UTC,"The US government is one of Microsofts biggest customers. Also, they say that the attack came from administrative access , not root.

That said, I have not read anything that specifically states that Snowdon got around SElinux, nor that this particular hack was a linux OS attack (or windows).

Iirc, the premise is that every US business would be forced to create a link to the clearinghouse and all their security issues woukd be uploaded to the government. This includes actual breaches, but also virus and malware or other security scans so the government would have more awareness of all the latest security problems ""on the ground"". Of course, what it really means is that the govt would know of all the security holes of every private business instead. Remember, it was knowledge of a security hole that allowed them access to Gmail - the tap on the unencrypted bridges between data centers.   Its unfortunate, but to the government, encryption hinders security - it aloows criminals to commit crime, rather than what we know to be true - encryption keeps us safe."

snowden,3a221r,RAndrewOhge,2,Tue Jun 16 16:54:22 2015 UTC,"The Sunday Times’ Snowden Story Is Journalism At Its Worst Photo: Sean Gallup/Getty Images  By Glenn Greenwald, June 15th, 2015  Western journalists claim that the big lesson they learned from their key role in selling the Iraq War to the public is that it’s hideous, corrupt and often dangerous journalism to give anonymity to government officials to let them propagandize the public, then uncritically accept those anonymously voiced claims as Truth.  But they’ve learned no such lesson.  That tactic continues to be the staple of how major US and British media outlets “report,” especially in the national security area.  And journalists who read such reports continue to treat self-serving decrees by unnamed, unseen officials – laundered through their media – as gospel, no matter how dubious are the claims or factually false is the reporting.  We now have one of the purest examples of this dynamic.  Last night, the Murdoch-owned Sunday Times published their lead front-page Sunday article, headlined “British Spies Betrayed to Russians and Chinese.”  Just as the conventional media narrative was shifting to pro-Snowden sentiment in the wake of a key court ruling and a new surveillance law, the article (behind a paywall: full text here) claims in the first paragraph that these two adversaries “have cracked the top-secret cache of files stolen by the fugitive US whistleblower Edward Snowden, forcing MI6 to pull agents out of live operations in hostile countries, according to senior officials in Downing Street, the Home Office and the security services.” It continues:  Western intelligence agencies say they have been forced into the rescue operations after Moscow gained access to more than 1m classified files held by the former American security contractor, who fled to seek protection from Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, after mounting one of the largest leaks in US history.  Senior government sources confirmed that China had also cracked the encrypted documents, which contain details of secret intelligence techniques and information that could allow British and American spies to be identified.  One senior Home Office official accused Snowden of having “blood on his hands”, although Downing Street said there was “no evidence of anyone being harmed”.  Aside from the serious retraction-worthy fabrications on which this article depends – more on those in a minute – the entire report is a self-negating joke.  It reads like a parody I might quickly whip up in order to illustrate the core sickness of western journalism.  Unless he cooked an extra-juicy steak, how does Snowden “have blood on his hands” if there is “no evidence of anyone being harmed?”  As one observer put it last night in describing the government instructions these Sunday Times journalists appear to have obeyed:  “There’s no evidence anyone’s been harmed but we’d like the phrase ‘blood on his hands’ somewhere in the piece.”  The whole article does literally nothing other than quote anonymous British officials.  It gives voice to banal but inflammatory accusations that are made about every whistleblower from Daniel Ellsberg to Chelsea Manning.  It offers zero evidence or confirmation for any of its claims.  The “journalists” who wrote it neither questioned any of the official assertions nor even quoted anyone who denies them.  It’s pure stenography of the worst kind: some government officials whispered these inflammatory claims in our ears and told us to print them, but not reveal who they are, and we’re obeying. Breaking!  Stephen Colbert captured this exact pathology with untoppable precision in his 2006 White House Correspondents speech, when he mocked American journalism to the faces of those who practice it:  But, listen, let’s review the rules.  Here’s how it works.  The President makes decisions.  He’s the decider.  The press secretary announces those decisions, and you people of the press type those decisions down.  Make, announce, type.  Just put ’em through a spell check and go home.  Get to know your family again.  Make love to your wife.  Write that novel you got kicking around in your head.  You know, the one about the intrepid Washington reporter with the courage to stand up to the administration?  You know, fiction!  The Sunday Times article is even worse because it protects the officials they’re serving with anonymity.  The beauty of this tactic is that the accusations can’t be challenged.  The official accusers are being hidden by the journalists so nobody can confront them or hold them accountable when it turns out to be false.  The evidence can’t be analyzed or dissected because there literally is none: they just make the accusation and, because they’re state officials, their media-servants will publish it with no evidence needed.  And as is always true, there is no way to prove the negative.  It’s like being smeared by a ghost with a substance that you can’t touch.  This is the very opposite of journalism.  Ponder how dumb someone has to be at this point to read an anonymous government accusation, made with zero evidence, and accept it as true.  But it works. Other news agencies mindlessly repeated the Sunday Times claims far and wide.  I watched last night as American and British journalists of all kinds reacted to the report on Twitter: by questioning none of it.  They did the opposite: they immediately assumed it to be true, then spent hours engaged in somber, self-serious discussions with one another over what the geopolitical implications are, how the breach happened, what it means for Snowden, etc.  This is the formula that shapes their brains: anonymous self-serving government assertions = Truth.  By definition, authoritarians reflexively believe official claims – no matter how dubious or obviously self-serving, even when made while hiding behind anonymity – because that’s how their submission functions.  Journalists who practice this sort of primitive reporting – I uncritically print what government officials tell me, and give them anonymity so they have no accountability for any it – do so out of a similar authoritarianism, or uber-nationalism, or laziness, or careerism.  Whatever the motives, the results are the same: government officials know they can propagandize the public at any time because subservient journalists will give them anonymity to do so and will uncritically disseminate and accept their claims.  At this point, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that journalists want it this way.  It’s impossible that they don’t know better.  The exact kinds of accusations laundered in the Sunday Times today are made – and then disproven – in every case where someone leaks unflattering information about government officials.  In the early 1970s, Nixon officials such as John Ehrlichman and Henry Kissinger planted accusations in the U.S. media that Daniel Ellsberg had secretly given the Pentagon Papers and other key documents to the Soviet Union; everyone now knows this was a lie, but at the time, American journalists repeated it constantly, helping to smear Ellsberg.  That’s why Ellsberg has constantly defended Snowden and Chelsea Manning from the start: because the same tactics were used to smear him.  The same thing happened with Chelsea Manning. When WikiLeaks first began publishing the Afghan War logs, U.S. officials screamed that they – all together now – had “blood on their hands.”  But when some journalists decided to scrutinize rather than mindlessly repeat the official accusation (i.e., some decided to do journalism), they found it was a fabrication.  Writing under the headline “US officials privately say WikiLeaks damage limited,” Reuters’ Mark Hosenball reported that “internal U.S. government reviews have determined that a mass leak of diplomatic cables caused only limited damage to U.S. interests abroad, despite the Obama administration’s public statements to the contrary.”  An AP report was headlined “AP review finds no WikiLeaks sources threatened,” and explained that “an Associated Press review of those sources raises doubts about the scope of the danger posed by WikiLeaks’ disclosures and the Obama administration’s angry claims, going back more than a year, that the revelations are life-threatening.”  Months earlier, McClatchy’s Nancy Youssef wrote an article headlined “Officials may be overstating the dangers from WikiLeaks,” and she noted that “despite similar warnings ahead of the previous two massive releases of classified U.S. intelligence reports by the website, U.S. officials concede that they have no evidence to date that the documents led to anyone’s death.”  Now we have exactly the same thing here.  There’s an anonymously made claim that Russia and China “cracked the top-secret cache of files” from Snowden’s, but there is literally zero evidence for that claim.  These hidden officials also claim that American and British agents were unmasked and had to be rescued, but not a single one is identified...

snowden,39rhja,50pg50vg,12,Sun Jun 14 01:15:12 2015 UTC,Russian security services had broken into encrypted files held by American computer analyst Snowden   Snowden relinquished and hasn't had a copy of the documents since blowing the whistle in Hong Kong. Isn't that right? He didn't travel with them and as far as I know hasn't gotten a copy back.
snowden,39rhja,UndesirableFarang,4,Sun Jun 14 03:44:10 2015 UTC,Yes. News may well have been that North Korea broke into the files. Something smells very fishy here. Would it be inconceivable that the well-placed government sources... lied?   Maybe withdrawing agents for a different reason and finding it convenient to blame it on Snowden. It's not like operation transparency is the hallmark of spy agencies.
snowden,39rhja,asimovwasright,2,Sun Jun 14 09:50:04 2015 UTC,"Wait...   Employees of intelligence agencies, such as the CIA, generally do not have the records of their clearance checks held by OPM, although some do, officials said."
snowden,39rhja,NemWan,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:36:27 2015 UTC,"Assuming this story is along the lines of ""Daniel Ellsberg delivered documents to the Soviet embassy"" (he didn't), it's a fact-free fairy tail meant to satisfy people who refuse to believe any narrative besides Snowden being a foreign spy.  Assuming Snowden is telling the truth, the only possible access Russia or China would have to the archive would be if they compromised the journalists who possess it, despite Snowden having the expertise to advise them how to prevent that. That scenario would embarrass the U.K. and allied intelligence agencies who have said the don't know what Snowden took and apparently were defeated by the journalists' security while Russia and China succeeded in breaching it?"
snowden,39rhja,coredev,10,Sun Jun 14 15:48:56 2015 UTC,So I expect more from the Guardian than this. They should know that Snowden did not have a copy ever since HK. And why not let him (or someone with a bit of knowledge) comment on this propaganda.
snowden,39rhja,lucas_brunelle,5,Sun Jun 14 06:20:16 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I'm surprised they gave this BS the spotlight in the first place. Of course they know Snowden didn't have the documents. Why allow the witch hunt on Snowden to continue? The British intelligence community wants to stress the ""illegality"" of what Snowden did, to switch the interest away from the outrageous programs they run, this has been obvious since 2013. But the Guardian? I thought they'd know better than quoting anonymous senior sources on alleged agent movement abroad. This is ridiculous."
snowden,39rhja,championruby,4,Sun Jun 14 09:08:13 2015 UTC,"Sometimes omissions and suppressions are not enough and the press lends itself to the dissemination of outright lies. One way to lie is to accept at face value what are known to be lies, passing them on to the public without adequate countervailing response. Face-value framing has characterised the press's performance from the McCarthy era down to more recent times... Without ever saying a particular story is true or not, but treating it at face value, the press engages in the propagation of misinformation.... When challenged on this, some reporters will argue that they cannot inject their own personal judgements into their reports, an argument that overlooks the fact that they are not being asked to - and in any case, often already do so. My criticism is that they (or their editors and owners) fail to do what they claim they do, give us a range of information and views that might allow us to form opinions contrary to the ones that permeate their news reports... Untruths that are repeated again and again in every major national medium soon take on a life of their own, to be passed on sometimes with little conscious awareness that a fabrication has been disseminated.

snowden,37opxd,DownUnderCrew,2,Fri May 29 05:07:50 2015 UTC,I think that the scale and specifics of the situations are not at all equivalent.    Snowden blew a whistle from the inside.  Hammond hacked in from the outside.    Snowden disclosed information about domestic and international improprieties which are of particular interest to other governments and world leaders.  The scope of Hammond's dump was much less.    The practices Snowden exposed have in many cases been regarded as illegal by our own judiciary.  This doesn't seem to be the case with Hammond's exposure.    Snowden carefully fed the data to a couple major journalists and tasked them with parsing and packaging and reporting - actually pushing relevant and safe information out to the public.  Hammond dumped it into a passive reservoir that the vast majority of people will never look at.    I'm not knocking Hammond's efforts or sacrifice.

snowden,37nskq,molo1134,4,Fri May 29 00:19:36 2015 UTC,"AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS struggle to agree on which surveillance programs to re-authorize before the Patriot Act expires, they might consider the unusual advice of an intelligence analyst at the National Security Agency who warned about the danger of collecting too much data. Imagine, the analyst wrote in a leaked document, that you are standing in a shopping aisle trying to decide between jam, jelly or fruit spread, which size, sugar-free or not, generic or Smucker’s. It can be paralyzing.  “We in the agency are at risk of a similar, collective paralysis in the face of a dizzying array of choices every single day,” the analyst wrote in 2011. “’Analysis paralysis’ isn’t only a cute rhyme. It’s the term for what happens when you spend so much time analyzing a situation that you ultimately stymie any outcome …. It’s what happens in SIGINT [signals intelligence] when we have access to endless possibilities, but we struggle to prioritize, narrow, and exploit the best ones.”  The document is one of about a dozen in which NSA intelligence experts express concerns usually heard from the agency’s critics: that the U.S. government’s “collect it all” strategy can undermine the effort to fight terrorism. The documents, provided to The Intercept by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, appear to contradict years of statements from senior officials who have claimed that pervasive surveillance of global communications helps the government identify terrorists before they strike or quickly find them after an attack.  The Patriot Act, portions of which expire on Sunday, has been used since 2001 to conduct a number of dragnet surveillance programs, including the bulk collection of phone metadata from American companies. But the documents suggest that analysts at the NSA have drowned in data since 9/11, making it more difficult for them to find the real threats. The titles of the documents capture their overall message: “Data Is Not Intelligence,” “The Fallacies Behind the Scenes,” “Cognitive Overflow?” “Summit Fever” and “In Praise of Not Knowing.” Other titles include “Dealing With a ‘Tsunami’ of Intercept” and “Overcome by Overload?”  The documents are not uniform in their positions. Some acknowledge the overload problem but say the agency is adjusting well. They do not specifically mention the Patriot Act, just the larger dilemma of cutting through a flood of incoming data. But in an apparent sign of the scale of the problem, the documents confirm that the NSA even has a special category of programs that is called “Coping With Information Overload.”  The jam vs. jelly document, titled “Too Many Choices,” started off in a colorful way but ended with a fairly stark warning: “The SIGINT mission is far too vital to unnecessarily expand the haystacks while we search for the needles. Prioritization is key.”  These doubts are infrequently heard from officials inside the NSA. These documents are a window into the private thinking of mid-level officials who are almost never permitted to discuss their concerns in public.  AN AMUSING PARABLE circulated at the NSA a few years ago. Two people go to a farm and purchase a truckload of melons for a dollar each. They then sell the melons along a busy road for the same price, a dollar. As they drive back to the farm for another load, they realize they aren’t making a profit, so one of them suggests, “Do you think we need a bigger truck?”  The parable was written by an intelligence analyst in a document dated Jan. 23, 2012 that was titled, “Do We Need a Bigger SIGINT Truck?” It expresses, in a lively fashion, a critique of the agency’s effort to collect what former NSA Director Keith Alexander referred to as “the whole haystack.” The critique goes to the heart of the agency’s drive to gather as much of the world’s communications as possible: because it may not find what it needs in a partial haystack of data, the haystack is expanded as much as possible, on the assumption that more data will eventually yield useful information.  “THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN YOU COLLECT IT ALL, WHEN YOU MONITOR EVERYONE, YOU UNDERSTAND NOTHING.” –EDWARD SNOWDEN  The Snowden files show that in practice, it doesn’t turn out that way: more is not necessarily better, and in fact, extreme volume creates its own challenges.  “Recently I tried to answer what seemed like a relatively straightforward question about which telephony metadata collection capabilities are the most important in case we need to shut something off when the metadata coffers get full,” wrote the intelligence analyst. “By the end of the day, I felt like capitulating with the white flag of, ‘We need COLOSSAL data storage so we don’t have to worry about it,’ (aka we need a bigger SIGINT truck).” The analyst added, “Without metrics, how do we know that we have improved something or made it worse? There’s a running joke … that we’ll only know if collection is important by shutting it off and seeing if someone screams.”  Another document, while not mentioning the dangers of collecting too much data, expressed concerns about pursuing entrenched but unproductive programs.  “How many times have you been watching a terrible movie, only to convince yourself to stick it out to the end and find out what happens, since you’ve already invested too much time or money to simply walk away?” the document asked. “This ‘gone too far to stop now’ mentality is our built-in mechanism to help us allocate and ration resources. However, it can work to our detriment in prioritizing and deciding which projects or efforts are worth further expenditure of resources, regardless of how much has already been ‘sunk.’ As has been said before, insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.”  “WE ARE DROWNING IN INFORMATION. AND YET WE KNOW NOTHING. FOR SURE.” –NSA INTELLIGENCE ANALYST Many of these documents were written by intelligence analysts who had regular columns distributed on NSANet, the agency’s intranet. One of the columns was called “Signal v. Noise,” another was called “The SIGINT Philosopher.” Two of the documents cite the academic work of Herbert Simon, who won a Nobel Prize for his pioneering research on what’s become known as the attention economy. Simon wrote that consumers and managers have trouble making smart choices because their exposure to more information decreases their ability to understand the information. Both documents mention the same passage from Simon’s essay, Designing Organizations for an Information-Rich World:  “In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.”  In addition to consulting Nobel-prize winning work, NSA analysts have turned to easier literature, such as Malcolm Gladwell’s best-selling Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. The author of a 2011 document referenced Blink and stated, “The key to good decision making is not knowledge. It is understanding. We are swimming in the former. We are desperately lacking in the latter.” The author added, “Gladwell has captured one of the biggest challenges facing SID today. Our costs associated with this information overload are not only financial, such as the need to build data warehouses large enough to store the mountain of data that arrives at our doorstep each day, but also include the more intangible costs of too much data to review, process, translate and report.”  Alexander, the NSA director from 2005 to 2014 and chief proponent of the agency’s “collect it all” strategy, vigorously defended the bulk collection programs. “What we have, from my perspective, is a reasonable approach on how we can defend our nation and protect our civil liberties and privacy,” he said at a security conference in Aspen in 2013. He added, “You need the haystack to find the needle.” The same point has been made by other officials, including James Cole, the former deputy attorney general who told a congressional committee in 2013, “If you’re looking for the needle in the haystack, you have to have the entire haystack to look through.”  NSA Slide, May 2011"
snowden,37nskq,molo1134,3,Fri May 29 03:20:46 2015 UTC,"The opposing viewpoint was voiced earlier this month by Snowden, who noted in an interview with the Guardian that the men who committed recent terrorist attacks in France, Canada and Australia were under surveillance—their data was in the haystack yet they weren’t singled out. “It wasn’t the fact that we weren’t watching people or not,” Snowden said. “It was the fact that we were watching people so much that we did not understand what we had. The problem is that when you collect it all, when you monitor everyone, you understand nothing.”  In a 2011 interview with SIDtoday, a deputy director in the Signals Intelligence Directorate was asked about “analytic modernization” at the agency. His response, while positive on the NSA’s ability to surmount obstacles, noted that it faced difficulties, including the fact that some targets use encryption and switch phone numbers to avoid detection. He pointed to volume as a particular problem.  “We live in an Information Age when we have massive reserves of information and don’t have the capability to exploit it,” he stated. “I was told that there are 2 petabytes of data in the SIGINT System at any given time. How much is that? That’s equal to 20 million 4-drawer filing cabinets. How many cabinets per analyst is that? By the end of this year, we’ll have 1 terabyte of data per second coming in. You can’t crank that through the existing processes and be effective.”  The documents noted the difficulty of sifting through the ever-growing haystack of data. For instance, a 2011 document titled “ELINT Analysts – Overcome by Overload? Help is Here with IM&S” outlined a half dozen computer tools that “are designed to invert the paradigm where an analyst spends more time searching for data than analyzing it.” Another document, written by an intelligence analyst in 2010, bluntly stated that “we are drowning in information. And yet we know nothing. For sure.” The analyst went on to ask, “Anyone know just how many tools are available at the Agency, alone? Would you know where to go to find out? Anyone ever start a new target…without the first clue where to begin? Did you ever start a project wondering if you were the sole person in the Intelligence Community to work this project? How would you find out?” The analyst, trying to encourage more sharing of tips about the best ways to find data in the haystack, concluded by writing, in boldface, “Don’t let those coming behind you suffer the way you have.”  The agency appears to be spending significant sums of money to solve the haystack problem. The document headlined “Dealing With a ‘Tsunami’ of Intercept,” written in 2006 by three NSA officials and previously published by The Intercept, outlined a series of programs to prepare for a near future in which the speed and volume of signals intelligence would explode “almost beyond imagination.” The document referred to a mysterious NSA entity–the “Coping With Information Overload Office.” This appears to be related to an item in the Intelligence Community’s 2013 Budget Justification to Congress, known as the “black budget”—$48.6 million for projects related to “Coping with Information Overload.”  The data glut is felt in the NSA’s partner agency in Britain, too. A slideshow entitled “A Short Introduction to SIGINT,” from GCHQ, the British intelligence agency, posed the following question: “How are people supposed to keep on top of all their targets and the new ones when they have far more than [they] could do in a day? How are they supposed to find the needle in the haystack and prioritise what is most important to look at?” The slideshow continued, “Give an analyst three leads, one of which is interesting: they may have time to follow that up. Give them three hundred leads, ten of which are interesting: that’s probably not much use.”  These documents tend to shy away from confrontation—they express concern with the status quo but do not blame senior officials or demand an abrupt change of course. They were written by agency staffers who appear to believe in the general mission of the NSA. For instance, the author of a “SIGINT Philosopher” column wrote that if the NSA was a corporation, it could have the following mission statement: “building informed decision makers — so that targets do not suffer our nation’s wrath unless they really deserve it — by exercising deity-like monitoring of the target.”  On occasion, however, the veil of bureaucratic deference is lowered. In another “SIGINT Philosopher” column, “Cognitive Overflow?,” the author offered a forthright assessment of the haystack problem and the weakness of proposed solutions:  “If an individual brain has finite ‘channel capacity,’ does the vast collective of SID, comprised of thousands of brilliant, yet limited, brains also have a definite ‘channel capacity’? If so, what is it? How do we know when we’ve reached it? What if we’ve already exceeded it? In essence, could SID’s reach exceed its grasp? Can the combined cognitive power of SID connect all the necessary dots to avoid, predict, or advise when the improbable, complex, or unthinkable happens?”  The column did not offer an optimistic view.  “Take for example the number of tools, clearances, systems, compliances, and administrative requirements we encounter before we even begin to engage in the work of the mission itself,” the column continued. “The mission then involves an ever-expanding set of complex issues, targets, accesses, and capabilities. The ‘cognitive burden,’ so to speak, must at times feel overwhelming to some of us.”  The analyst who wrote the column dismissed, politely but firmly, the typical response of senior officials when they are asked in public about their ability to find needles in their expanding haystack.  “Surely someone will point out that the burgeoning amalgam of technological advances will aid us in shouldering the burden,” he noted. “However, historically, this scenario doesn’t seem to completely bear out. The onslaught of more computer power—often intended to automate some processes—has in many respects demanded an expansion of our combined ‘channel capacity’ rather than curbing the flow of the information.”    Documents published with this article:  Too Many Choices Cognitive Overflow?

snowden,34zjzr,Jdcrunchman,1 point,Sat May 9 00:11:10 2015 UTC,"Here's the text:    Back in 2003, while Airbus was still in the tricky process of designing the A380, the world's largest commercial passenger airliner, its then security auditor Andrew Phillipou stood up at a security conference in London to explain how the organisation intended to keep its trade secrets secret.  Because the A380 was such a vast project, it was involving third-party engineering and technology companies more than ever before in the design of key components, effectively extending its extranet across the whole world. This included suppliers based in Seattle, just a few miles down the road from its main rival Boeing, as well as in India, China and other parts of Asia not necessarily well-renowned for respecting intellectual property.  Before they could join the A380 programme, which promised lucrative returns for companies that got involved, they had to prove that they took computer security seriously. And that's where Phillipou's team came in: it was their task to jet off across the world and security audit prospective suppliers' systems, both in terms of technical IT security, as well as physical security.  It was no box-ticking exercise: Phillipou's team uncovered data centres with great, big holes in the walls and companies with networks lacking even basic security, riddled with viruses and goodness-knows what else - and these were all high-tech companies where the management ought to have known better. His team even uncovered ""black boxes"" connected to the network of an Airbus satellite office, ""with a very active secret service"".  At the time when Phillipou was speaking, the automatic assumption would have been that he was referring to China. But following the Edward Snowden revelations, and their fallout, it could equally have been in the UK, US or anywhere in Europe.  Last week, German newspaper Der Spiegel revealed how the German foreign intelligence agency, BND, had helped the US National Security Agency (NSA) use surveillance stations on its territories to spy on technology companies.  ""The Americans weren't just interested in terrorism; they also used their technical abilities to spy on companies and agencies in Western Europe. They didn't even shy away from pursuing German targets,"" revealed the newspaper.  Although the operation was uncovered in 2008, it wasn't until it was all blown into the open by NSA whistleblower Snowden that something was done about it.  And now, Airbus is threatening to sue the German government after a ""closed"" parliamentary enquiry had heard evidence that BND used its its base in southern Bavaria, which it shares with the NSA, to eavesdrop on Airbus communications - potentially gleaning Airbus intellectual property in the process.  The industrial espionage conducted by US and German intelligence agencies was, according to a secret agreement between the two, focused purely on non-US and non-German companies - meaning that British technology companies, such as ARM, BAE Systems and Dyson, could also have been targeted. But Airbus has implied that it has more than just a vague belief that it may have been targeted.  ""We are aware that as a large company in the sector, we are a target and subject of espionage,"" the company said in a statement to news agency AFP. ""However, in this case we are alarmed because there is concrete suspicion of industrial espionage,"" it added. Furthermore, the German version of the press statement revealed that it had filed a ""criminal complaint against persons unknown on suspicion of industry espionage"".  According to reports, the US side of the surveillance installation supplied search terms on a weekly basis to their German counterparts, who would then seek out the information they requested. A total of 690,000 phone numbers and 7.8 million IP addresses were surveilled by the BND up until 2013 when Snowden exposed the operation.  As it happens, Airbus never did work out exactly what the black boxes that it discovered connected to the network of one of its satellite offices were doing, nor who planted them there, said Phillipou. However, if Phillipou has kept them as evidence it may soon find out."

snowden,34i9av,mmmkunz,2,Fri May 1 18:28:25 2015 UTC,"The US intelligence community claimed that they only shared information with the Saudi government about Airbus' bribes paid to a certain official and that information on foreign firms' bidding on contracts would never be shared with US firms.   Former Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post (March 17, 2000) after the Echelon scandal occurred. I pasted in below. It's really interesting and shows how dismissive he is of European economic competitiveness and how neoliberal economic ideology might restrain US state-led industrial espionage:  ""What is the recent flap regarding Echelon and U.S. spying on European industries all about? We'll begin with some candor from the American side. Yes, my continental European friends, we have spied on you. And it's true that we use computers to sort through data by using keywords. Have you stopped to ask yourselves what we're looking for?  The European Parliament's recent report on Echelon, written by British journalist Duncan Campbell, has sparked angry accusations from continental Europe that U.S. intelligence is stealing advanced technology from European companies so that we can -- get this -- give it to American companies and help them compete. My European friends, get real. True, in a handful of areas European technology surpasses American, but, to say this as gently as I can, the number of such areas is very, very, very small. Most European technology just isn't worth our stealing.  Why, then, have we spied on you? The answer is quite apparent from the Campbell report -- in the discussion of the only two cases in which European companies have allegedly been targets of American secret intelligence collection. Of Thomson-CSF, the report says: ""The company was alleged to have bribed members of the Brazilian government selection panel."" Of Airbus, it says that we found that ""Airbus agents were offering bribes to a Saudi official."" These facts are inevitably left out of European press reports.  That's right, my continental friends, we have spied on you because you bribe. Your companies' products are often more costly, less technically advanced or both, than your American competitors'. As a result you bribe a lot. So complicit are your governments that in several European countries bribes still are tax-deductible.  When we have caught you at it, you might be interested, we haven't said a word to the U.S. companies in the competition. Instead we go to the government you're bribing and tell its officials that we don't take kindly to such corruption. They often respond by giving the most meritorious bid (sometimes American, sometimes not) all or part of the contract. This upsets you, and sometimes creates recriminations between your bribers and the other country's bribees, and this occasionally becomes a public scandal. We love it.  Why do you bribe? It's not because your companies are inherently more corrupt. Nor is it because you are inherently less talented at technology. It is because your economic patron saint is still Jean Baptiste Colbert, whereas ours is Adam Smith. In spite of a few recent reforms, your governments largely still dominate your economies, so you have much greater difficulty than we in innovating, encouraging labor mobility, reducing costs, attracting capital to fast-moving young businesses and adapting quickly to changing economic circumstances. You'd rather not go through the hassle of moving toward less dirigisme. It's so much easier to keep paying bribes.  The Central Intelligence Agency collects other economic intelligence, but the vast majority of it is not stolen secrets. The Aspin-Brown Commission four years ago found that about 95% of U.S. economic intelligence comes from open sources.  The Campbell report describes a sinister-sounding U.S. meeting in Washington where -- shudder! -- CIA personnel are present and the participants -- brace yourself -- ""identify major contracts open for bid"" in Indonesia. Mr. Campbell, I suppose, imagines something like this: A crafty CIA spy steals stealthily out of a safe house, changes disguises, checks to make sure he's not under surveillance, coordinates with a spy satellite and . . . buys an Indonesian newspaper. If you Europeans really think we go to such absurd lengths to obtain publicly available information, why don't you just laugh at us instead of getting in high dudgeon?  What are the economic secrets, in addition to bribery attempts, that we have conducted espionage to obtain? One example is some companies' efforts to conceal the transfer of dual-use technology. We follow sales of supercomputers and certain chemicals closely, because they can be used not only for commercial purposes but for the production of weapons of mass destruction. Another is economic activity in countries subject to sanctions -- Serbian banking, Iraqi oil smuggling.  But do we collect or even sort secret intelligence for the benefit of specific American companies? Even Mr. Campbell admits that we don't, although he can't bring himself to say so except with a double negative: ""In general this is not incorrect."" The Aspin-Brown Commission was more explicit: ""U.S. Intelligence Agencies are not tasked to engage in `industrial espionage' -- i.e. obtaining trade secrets for the benefit of a U.S. company or companies.""  The French government is forming a commission to look into all this. I hope the commissioners come to Washington. We should organize two seminars for them. One would cover our Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and how we use it, quite effectively, to discourage U.S. companies from bribing foreign governments. A second would cover why Adam Smith is a better guide than Colbert for 21st-century economies. Then we could move on to industrial espionage, and our visitors could explain, if they can keep straight faces, that they don't engage in it. Will the next commission pursue the issue of rude American maitre d's?  Get serious, Europeans. Stop blaming us and reform your own statist economic policies. Then your companies can become more efficient and innovative, and they won't need to resort to bribery to compete.  And then we won't need to spy on you."""

It's the taking away that is, and most of them just want to soak the rich to do it.  I wouldn't even necessarily be against that (because of massive economic unfairness created by government itself in the first place) but realistically it just isn't happening; and even if it did it would serve to further centralize power.  But a voluntary/apolitical UBI solution is a very non-controlverial thing (unless you are obsessed with redistributive taxation)  This is the approach I'm taking with /r/FairShare  We're trying to build a bucket and a hose and figure out how to fill it later."

( I have no problem with the public siphoning money back from parasitic entities like Goldman Sachs and others in bed with Gov)  Using government as a mechanism for positive change is a mostly futile pursuit. They will allow a political movement or two to get some traction as a method of building consent. Once everyone gets together in Washington, all that activism goes out the window and its all about who has the power and who pays.  I honestly think something like UBI would organically arise in a more free society. If nations were actively competing for citizens on a free market, would not UBI be a perfect selling point?"
