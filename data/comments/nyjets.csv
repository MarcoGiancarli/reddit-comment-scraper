nyjets,3e2z6n,G1az3d,3,Tue Jul 21 16:02:04 2015 UTC,"We're not allowed to use more than one helmet per season now, but they could at least slap the old school decal on the helmets. Wish there was a way to get the grey face mask as well."
nyjets,3e2z6n,JohnnyVNCR,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:57 2015 UTC,"Does the rule also pertain to face masks? I know it does for the helmet itself because of the padding but I can't see the face mask making a difference. And you're right, all they have to do is slap that logo on the current helmets and it'd be essentially the same thing, I just dig the white out look to it."
nyjets,3e2z6n,G1az3d,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:58 2015 UTC,I don't think it does. I think the packers? have a different color face mask on their alts.

nyjets,3e2z6n,slimer16,-8,Tue Jul 21 20:49:38 2015 UTC,I don't like a Patriot Champion reenacting a true Jet legends SI cover.  Bring on the downvotes
nyjets,3e2z6n,the_furry_stoner,5,Tue Jul 21 21:25:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry you're still bitter about the Jets not even offering him a contract last year when he was a free agent. I also apologise that the Pats were the only place willing to give him the contract he wanted and fit the bill of the team he wanted to play for. Revis isn't perfect but he is by far the best Jet since Curtis Martin and maybe even the best since Klecko or Joe. Pats fans like to joke around and say ""Patriots legend Darrelle Revis lolz"" but the truth is that he will always be remembered as a Jet. When he is enshrined in the HOF the Patriots will be nothing more than one line and a few dates, the Jets will be what he is remembered for."
nyjets,3e2z6n,slimer16,-2,Tue Jul 21 22:04:18 2015 UTC,"He is a greedy fuck who bailed on us after coming back from a mostly season long ending injury.  I loved every minute he played for us and do not deny his skill, but the hold out shit and everything else that's happened afterwards will never sit right with me.  You are absolutely correct that he will be enshrined in the HOF, but you are in absolute denial if you think his time with the Pats will be considered some minor part in his career.  From now until the end of time his name will be written down and apart of the New England Patriots Championship team, and unless he wins one with Jets (which I hope he does, but highly doubt happens), I can guarantee he will be wearing one ring after retirement that would, and should, piss off Jets fans."

nyjets,3e3nst,LayzeeLar,4,Tue Jul 21 20:44:19 2015 UTC,"I think ranking Mariota and Winston(Im very high on Winston BTW) above qbs who played in the NFL is ridiculous for the most part,they should both be exempt from the ranking as they haven't played a down.  Smith should be higher than McCown,I honestly don't know how McCown keeps getting second chances in the NFL he plays like a rookie and has been in the league since 2003. I think McCown is the worst starting quaterback this season and could be in the top 10 of worst starting QBs of all time.  I think  Smith is probably tied with Bortles though Bortles shouldn't be ahead of Griffin,Cassel,and Hoyer."

nyjets,3e3nst,thecakeslayer,2,Wed Jul 22 02:59:28 2015 UTC,Typical ESPN shitting on the Jets cause they're considered the second tier team in NY. Geno shouldn't be below any QB who hasn't started a game yet plus he has Decker who can make average QB's like Peyton look good.
nyjets,3e3nst,3lauYourMind,2,Wed Jul 22 02:55:29 2015 UTC,Espn constantly ranks jets lower. Maybe it gives them more page views.  Not really trying to defend geno but it's pretty consistent generalization.
nyjets,3e3nst,Onefortwo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:51:52 2015 UTC,"If Ryan Fitzpatrick was a starting QB still, would he be #32? Because that's the only way I can see Geno Smith being #32. He has him beat. And to put rookies not at the bottom is a joke."

The best they could tell me was that they do not carry Sheldon Richardson jerseys, they weren't simply sold out, and that the reason could be related to the NFL or player not signing away their rights to have them made.

nyjets,3dw8dk,cstpreditin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:23:10 2015 UTC,Big Mo went down and I for one didn't even notice. The Jets really didn't drop off without him. Not saying he's not awesome but there's a lot of depth on this defense and I really wonder how much he would be missed.
nyjets,3dw8dk,Blitz93,2,Mon Jul 20 11:47:31 2015 UTC,The defensive line was mostly ineffective in general last year because the corner play was so bad. Teams knew all they had to do was get the ball out quick and it would neutralize the line. Look at any other year where we had even average corner play. Mo is an absolute beast.
nyjets,3dw8dk,cstpreditin,2,Mon Jul 20 11:55:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the line was ""ineffective"" last yr. They were the only reason we were even close or didn't get totally blown out in most games last yr. I do agree he is a beast but I'd really like to see what he does this yr with the team that Mac put in place. Also gonna be interesting to see how they perform without Sheldon playing for the first quarter of the yr. should be a good gauge on who we should worry about signing long term."
nyjets,3dw8dk,Blitz93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:01:38 2015 UTC,I just mean in the sense that they couldn't dominate the game as in years past because the corner situation made it significantly easier to take them out of the game. This year when there isn't a wide open WR 2 seconds after the snap they'll be much better.

nyjets,3dugcl,woodchips24,8,Sun Jul 19 18:07:51 2015 UTC,"He did drop 50 pounds and removed a full second from his 40 time. While there's less of him to push against for a Center, he's more explosive and fights harder to keep a center on his back heel. He's probably going for a faster Haloti Ngata style of Nose Tackle, which would be dangerous.   Putting back on weight is a lot easier than losing it if he's not as effective. With the additional muscle mass he earned this offseason, that could translate to a more dangerous player.  Either way, the Jets picked up DL coach Pepper Johnson, the guy who trained up Ninkovitch and Wilfork. If Snacks fits between those two styles, Pepper will be the guy to help him adjust to his new build."
nyjets,3dugcl,otomotopia,5,Sun Jul 19 18:47:01 2015 UTC,"DL coach Pepper Johnson, the guy who trained up Ninkovitch and Wilfork   Don't forget Dareus last year"

nyjets,3dugcl,woodchips24,2,Sun Jul 19 21:26:47 2015 UTC,There's no way he removed a full second from his forty time in three months.
nyjets,3dugcl,earl_smith_thethird,6,Sun Jul 19 20:59:46 2015 UTC,"Over the last four years and through his work with Parabolic, he's dropped 50 pounds and maintained the weight loss. He also shaved more than a second off his initial 40 time, aiding in a transformation that has him in the best shape of his life heading into his most important season."

nyjets,3dugcl,HaruSoul,0,Sun Jul 19 21:11:24 2015 UTC,So if he didn't really like rushing the passer before as he stated? How come he's so fired up to do it now? He did say he'd rather stick to zero gap right? I'm just a lil confused. Either way I hope it works for him as its only gonna make our line that much better especially with Sheldon out. We'll also have absolutely have no chance of re signing him if he ends up throwing up decent sack numbers and I'd really like to atleast have a shot at holding on to him rather than losing him and possibly big Mo or even Sheldon now that he's a big risk being that he's only one joint away from being suspended for a yr

nyjets,3dsf1a,CosmicWy,2,Sun Jul 19 14:45:38 2015 UTC,"I'm confused as to the scheme we will be running. Man and zone blocking requires a different type of OL personnel. Gailey is known for zone blocking BUT carpenter, who was the marquee FA signing for the OL, is absolutely putrid at zone but is pretty good at man blocking.   You made it sound like stacy is a zone rb which further confuses me."
nyjets,3dsf1a,LennyLongshoes,2,Sun Jul 19 01:33:52 2015 UTC,Stacy is definitely more of a finesse zone runner than a power runner. He's looking for blocks more than he's looking for openings.

nyjets,3ds5xa,JETSFANSWS,4,Sat Jul 18 23:01:02 2015 UTC,Where are you flying into? Assuming you're flying into Newark you could probably take the Long Branch Line (Shoreline) and get a nice hotel by the shore for relatively cheap considering it's off season for them and you can just take the train to MetLife from there as well. I would avoid NYC at all cost due to price.
nyjets,3ds5xa,3lauYourMind,2,Sun Jul 19 00:10:24 2015 UTC,"We are flying into LaGuardia, my brother hasn't been to New York ever and I wanted him to see a bit, also the tickets seemed reasonable enough considering that the drive to Metlife is ~30 minutes from there. I hope I didn't screw up already now that you said Newark. ""Midwesterners"""
nyjets,3ds5xa,the_silent_thriller,3,Sun Jul 19 00:50:18 2015 UTC,"No screw up on your part.  Look into airbnb if you want to stay in NYC but don't want to pay hotel prices, if either of you have never been definitely stay in the city.  If you do, don't think about driving to metlife, take the train from Penn station right to the stadium (you change at Secaucus, just follow the crowd), its an easy ride but give yourself time so your not rushed and can take it ""all"" in."

Thanks for the advice!"
nyjets,3ds5xa,Adrian_mx,2,Sun Jul 19 16:14:28 2015 UTC,"Times Square is just the tourist trap of NYC. It's what people know well, but it's not representative of the ""real"" New York. So I feel compelled to say not to go to Times Square. Midtown West is fine, it will be very convenient for getting to the game if you're near Penn Station.  If it's the VIP pass that allows you to also cut the whole line, it would be worth it. You get a pretty cool view from the top. You get a great view from the Top of the Rock (Rockefeller Center), so you should look into that too, especially if you'll go there anyway to see the tree."

They know not to compare themselves to the Dolphins, because the Dolphins have a franchise quarterback. So in the competition for not worst in the division, their easiest targets to tear down are the Jets.   They'll shut up in a couple of months. Outside RB and LB, their entire position groups are either just as good, or inferior to ours. We all know how garbage Rex is at managing offenses and their defense, while still strong, got worse with the loss of Kiko Alonso. While the Jets o-line and Qb's aren't great, I'd choose theirs over the Bills' 10 times out of 10.

nyjets,3de6sd,otomotopia,3,Wed Jul 15 18:46:05 2015 UTC,"Note that most of these TDs came with four receivers (3 WR 1 TE). In Gailey's spread offense, we should see those sets more often and Geno will hopefully be making use of it.   Also, I'm really hoping the ""geno can't make presnap reads"" bit is a joke, because its looking like he read the coverage perfectly. That Decker one on the bottom is a great example, along with the Amaro one and finding the Mike/switching the RB bump protection on the second Cumberland one.  I'm expecting to see him execute the #1 and #3 of your ""you can do these better Geno"" passes better this year. We'll see a lot of Kerley blowing past the nickel corner (#1) with the focus being set on Decker and Marshall. We'll also see a lot of Marshall making #3 a lot easier to complete for Geno with that massive vertical and his leaping ability. Geno made the throw as soon as the safety bit the wrong way though, which is a great sign for him."

nyjets,3dcaay,the_furry_stoner,8,Wed Jul 15 13:29:12 2015 UTC,He took a step last year. Not a huge one but definitely a good one. Halved his TOs and increased his TDs. When he had talent he played very well and he has shown some serious progress with his footwork and physical ability. His deep ball is great and I think this change of pace on the coaching staff will do wonders for him. But he needs to make that big step you were talking about this year.
nyjets,3dcaay,bamflax8,-1,Wed Jul 15 14:08:47 2015 UTC,"It may just be my inner NY sports fan speaking but I was looking for him to be leaps and bounds better than his rookie season.

But not substantially better.  OL: Hold - meh, a year older  WR: Buy - Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker in a Chan Gailey system makes me giddy.  TE: Buy - Amaro will suprise.  DL: Hold - It's hard to improve upon on of the best 3-4 defensive lines and with a star player out for 4 games it will continue to be hard. Let's hope our rookie can fill the void and excel.  LB: Sell - I feel like I needed to sell somewhere, why not here? Calvin Pace is old. David Harris is getting up there too. Demario Davis... love that dude.  DB: BUY - THE BAND IS BACK TOGETHER. Also, I don't think we could get worse than last year. Our safeties will be playing safety now, so that's good.  ST: Hold - This year is looking Folkin awesome.  Coaches: Buy"
nyjets,3daej2,Killsitty,2,Tue Jul 14 19:30:18 2015 UTC,"Agree with you everything except RB. I think we have one of the most exciting comitties in the league, and I can't think of another team with the depth or ceiling that we have."

nyjets,3daej2,Random908,2,Wed Jul 15 03:24:49 2015 UTC,They called him Fitzmagic because of what he could do under Gailey in Buffalo.
nyjets,3daej2,woodchips24,2,Wed Jul 15 14:13:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know don't worry. What I was saying was that you have to use him on short-intermediate passes. You also have to set up a strong ground game. If you can't do that, he'll try to save the day, and likely will ruin it. Granted, I think he is better than Vick was last year, especially with that defence and WRs of yours, so you should have a decent failsafe for Geno/Petty if needed. Granted its all about his usage"
nyjets,3daej2,Random908,3,Wed Jul 15 14:20:34 2015 UTC,"QB: Hold. Geno saw improvement last year, not because it was the end of the season, but because the WR group improved with the addition of Harvin. I'm not ready to sell him yet, but I ain't buying yet either. Petty is an unknown, but if he and Geno play well moving forward, we could be in the best position we've been in since Testaverde was in green and white.  OL: Sell. D'Brick is steadily declining, even if Giacomini is average and Mangold is turning into our Cal Ripken. Guard is super uncertain, with Aboushi stepping up last season but no clear starter opposite penalty magnet Colon.  WR: BUY. BUY IT ALL. This is the most talented WR group the Jets have had this side of Keyshawn Johnson. What the starting 3 lack in speed for big plays they have in size, strength, technique, YAC, blocking, and vertical. Marshall is a redzone threat and good for an 8 yard curl any given play. Decker is an immaculate route runner. Kerley is finally going up against the nickle corners he wrecks. And Devin Smith has that playmaking ability.  TE: Buy, but nearly a hold. Despite my thoughts that the loss of Sudfeld will prove to be a big one (especially on special teams), and that Cumberland is one of the bottom teir TE starters in the league, our acquisitions will play well for us in blocking-an area of need for the Jets. Amaro is something special and definitely an underrated factor going into the next season. Throw in better blocking and the TE group should be more productive than the previous one.  RB: Buy. That Zac Stacy resides as the RB4 on our roster shows how stacked we are at that position. A necessary one given the number of injuries everyone not named Powell has suffered. The depth will be key to keeping everyone fresh, but I wouldn't be surprised to see a TE cut in favor of keeping 4 RBs on the roster.  Special Teams: Buy. Not because of players. But because Bobby April is now the coach of that unit. Saalim Hakim could have a breakout year under April, though. April makes return teams better than they should be.  DE- Buy. Despite the loss of Ellis (who commanded a double team or a chip 75% of the time he was on the field) and the loss of Richardson for 4 games, Williams was widely regarded the best player in the draft, period. Four games should season him up before he goes back into the rotation. But man, what a rotation we have. It's going to be great having those 300 lb men NOT sucking air during the final plays. The pressure a fresh Richardson and Wilkerson can generate against winded linemen will be smothering.  LB- Hold. We didn't lose anyone particularly important outside of their special teams contributions, and we gained a true 3-4 pass rusher in Mauldin. We kept the key personnel at the position, eliminated some chaff, and brought in fresh blood. It's a wash unless Mauldin is above average.  CB- BUY. BUY EVEN MORE OF IT ALL. We bought 2x pro bowlers, 3x starters, and Batman and Robin are back in Gotham. We won't be seeing anywhere as many third and long completions against this pass defense. If an RB gets to the second level it could cause some problems though-Cro is not a good tackler. Either way, its a massive improvement to a position that desperately needed it.  Safety-Hold. Gilchrist and Pryor are moving back to their natural positions, we'll see how that pans out before we can make any comments. We do know several of the safeties on the bench can handle TEs. Antonio Allen is the TE wrangler, and I hope former safety Todd Bowles uses him as such. But with so many unknowns, we've yet to see the Louisville Slugger live up to his nickname.  I hope that about covers it!"

nyjets,3daej2,woodchips24,0,Wed Jul 15 14:17:02 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: when he was on the field, he would draw a higher percentage of chips and double teams than Harrison."
nyjets,3daej2,otomotopia,3,Wed Jul 15 15:30:02 2015 UTC,"QB: Hold, but on the risky buy side  WR: Buy, Decker is healthy, and Marshal is clicking with Geno. Fetch me my white pants.  RB: Hold until we see what it looks like  OL: Hold, Brick and Mangold are older, but Carpenter was a good addtition  TE: Buy, Amaro will fix his problem where he goes for the play before the pass  DL: Buy, because you can't have too much talent in a position group, no matter what anyone says. When all four are playing, there'll be room to switch them around so we're well rested against a beat-up o-line.  LB: Sell Everyone is older and wasn't great last season. Could turn into a hold if Coples makes it in a make or break year for him. Don't see them lighting it up in even the most positive scenarios.  S: Buy, Antonio played good enough as a CB1 for me to trust him as a FS against TEs and the slot, and Calvin Pryor is back at SS where he'll show everybody why he's called the Louisville Slugger. Throw in Todd Bowles' reputation for using his safeties in creative ways and you have a sack and INT machine.  CB: Buy is an understatement. If our guys from last year were healthy again this year, this would be a buy. But Mac Daddy went beyond that. Our CBs could shape up to be the in the conference if not the league. Revis and Cro + Skrine for depth and the nickel? That'd be and improvement over any team not called the Seahawks.  It make look like there are quite a lot of buys and next to no sells, but let's be honest. We can't get much lower than last year and that's when you buy. We'll at least double our wins this year."
nyjets,3daej2,matap821,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:17:20 2015 UTC,"QB: Hold. Wait and see what happens between Geno and Gailey, but at least we have insurance should he fail to improve RB: Hold. We've established ourselves as a physical running team with Ivory, Ridley, Stacy and Powell. Will that help or hurt us that we didn't add dimension? WR: Buy. A lot more variety in the weapons, Marsh is a true #1, Decker is a true #2, and Devin Smith will be conducive to Geno's strength as a deep ball thrower. Kerley getting back in the slot will help him a lot too.  TE: Hold: I'm cautious with Amaro, and I'm extremely cautious with Cumberland. At least we have a solid blocker in Davis.  OL: Buy. Carpenter could make or break the line, but given the length of his contract, I feel he could definitely try hard and work hard for more money. Giacomini will be fixed, and maybe Brick rebounds. Only position of contention is RG, hopefully Colon holds up one more year, and if not, Aboushi or Winters makes the leap. Do I even need to talk about Mangold? DL: Buy. Even with the Richardson suspension, you have to think that Leonard Williams will be a solid replacement piece, Wilkerson will play even harder to justify a contract extension, and our depth is going to be crazy good. And when Richardson does come back, look out offenses. LB: Hold. Harris maybe has a year or two before he declines, hopefully Mauldin becomes the edge rusher we've needed for years. If Pace and Babin stay off the field or are released, it may help. Couples is the wild card here, if he can play to his potential, then great, if not, we can move on from him.  Secondary: Buy. Even for a couple years, having Revis, Cro and Skrine is going to be a hamper to offensive aerial attacks. Having Pryor back in his natural position is going to be a lot better for him, it all depends on Gilchrist and Allen. Hopefully they can be patched up and ready to go.  ST: Sell. I feel that Folk's value as a kicker may diminish a bit, and Quigley hasn't been the best punter for us. As for the return game, it depends on who's running it out. Hakim? Kerley? Powell? We'll see. This is more of a slight sell than anything else.  Coaching: Buy. Having a coach who is confident but not brash is going to help, and one who instills true discipline is definitely a plus. Gailey simplifying the offense is going to help a lot too."

nyjets,3d9s31,Reckless_Vlad,21,Tue Jul 14 16:44:21 2015 UTC,"Geno and Petty are 6 months apart in age.  Petty is no more a long term solution at QB than Geno is currently.  Petty was a 4th round pick who, while having a canon, has been picked apart in most other areas of his play.  We do not have a Mike McCarthy (aka QB whisperer) coaching up a 22 year old, 1st round pick Aaron Rodgers from the bench for 3 years before he starts.  We have Kevin Patullo (a career WRs coach) as our Quarterbacks coach with a Head Coach who is a defensive guru.  If Chan does well, then he will most likely be gone within three years for a larger coaching role.  Petty is not a QB that is ready to take the reigns next season.  If Geno makes strides this year, Petty is never in the conversation again.  If Geno fails, and we move on to Petty the following year and hope that a late round questionable quarterback (essentially a rookie) can make a major impact. If that doesn't happen, well, we can control+f geno's name and replace it with Bryce in all of our current conversations and continue the same  conversations we've been having for years until we can draft a franchise quarterback.   The reality is that most of the league's starting quarterbacks have been drafted in the first two rounds.  If they aren't named Tom Brady, then chances are they're one of the non-1st/2nd rounders and they're bottom 25% of the league.  In the only order that matters: 1. Geno is our shortest term answer. 2. Fitz is next up on our short term answer. 3. Geno could be our long term answer. 4. Petty could be our long term answer - if all else fails, which means we're back in the drafting a QB market.  I like Bryce, but I am not holding out any hope that he in the answer.  If his ascends his scouting report and becomes the next starting QB, then that's great!  I just have a harder time seeing that happen then the Jets just drafting another 1st round quarterback.  edit:  see italics above  edit2:  pretend i also mentioned Russel Wilson's name in there somewhere."
nyjets,3d9s31,CosmicWy,3,Tue Jul 14 17:30:12 2015 UTC,"Exact feelings. Players who are as uncomfortable as Petty under duress rarely make it in the NFL. Development is necessary just for the team to feel compelled to keep him on the roster, otherwise he's just a big arm with no actual football skills. At least Geno, despite his slow processing and timing issues has some level of pocket skills, defense reading abilities and has developed well in his first two years to at least make it believable that he's got some kind of NFL future within him (whether that's as a career backup ala Campbell or an average quality starter).  I'd believe in Geno's progression into a franchise QB before i believe in Pettys."
nyjets,3d9s31,NannigarCire,3,Tue Jul 14 18:01:39 2015 UTC,"This. I also wouldn't be surprised if Geno has a horrible year we look into taking a top round QB (depending on what the group looks like) in the next draft.  Then again, I'm sure we will also have more rumors about trading Mo+ picks for a QB next year if that happens too."
nyjets,3d9s31,Zerd85,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:38:10 2015 UTC,"I keep seeing people saying Petty has a cannon but he showed just average velocity during his throws during the combine and workouts he had.  I think his highest throws were 53 mph, that is middle of the road and below for instance, Winston and Mariota.    So he doesn't have the biggest arm around, and on top of that also lacks accuracy and timing.  This guy is the definition of a project that is impossible to predict."
nyjets,3d9s31,editnonameedit,2,Tue Jul 14 21:00:20 2015 UTC,"53mph is respectable. :\    When I say canon I guess i mean highlights when i see big throws and deep shots downfield.  For instance, Mike Glennon was described - almost universally - as a pocket passer with a canon.  He threw 49 at the combine.  (Also Mariota and Winston were 56 & 55, respectively. Not statistically significantly higher).  Anyway, I guess I like to describe him that way because it's really his redeeming quality.  He makes a lot of good throws.  He does not have elite accuracy (Geno's college comp% was significantly higher).  He's didn't protect the ball any better than Geno in college.  He is not hailed for his pocket presence, decision making under duress, or athleticism.   He is an athletic-ish guy who can throw a football.   This was the most argumentative I was able to be whilst TOTALLY agreeing with literally everything you wrote.  cheers bud."

nyjets,3d9s31,partytimeboat,2,Fri Jul 17 19:26:10 2015 UTC,"Petty is a contingency plan. If Geno plays out his contract and we decide we don't want to move on with him, we might turn to Petty. We'll probably keep drafting QB's and maybe let Petty try his hand as a starter. If Geno proves to be the long term solution, then Petty will be nothing more than a backup QB. And for a 4th round draft pick, that's pretty good value. But if the Jets feel like a QB with a higher ceiling than Petty is available to them when we're looking for a QB, don't expect them to stick to their ""long term plan"""
nyjets,3d9s31,viewless25,2,Tue Jul 14 21:11:57 2015 UTC,"I think that Geno is the short term now mainly because we don't know exactly how he's going to do in Gailey's spread system. If he succeeds and proves to be consistent in the spread, then that's great, we've fixed our ""now"" quarterback and can worry about other things. If not, we have a guy who can take over without much of an adjustment in Fitz. Petty IMO is the project of the group because his skills as of now are not conducive to running an NFL offense. Sure he can throw, sure he's won at Baylor, but he's like the Tom Savage of this year's class, a project QB who we need a good long look at before deciding if he's worth grooming, or just keeping on as a backup. Worst case scenario is Geno falters/gets hurt and Fitz gets hurt. Petty ends up being the starter. Let's hope it never comes to it this year, but if we feel that Geno's ceiling is reached, then we start developing Petty or, given next year's QB crop in the draft, take a QB first round."
nyjets,3d9s31,giobbistar21,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:49:49 2015 UTC,"I think Petty is in a tough situation to ever be a long term starter. If Geno or Fitzpatrick fail this year then I think the Jets commit to another Quarterback in the first round/find another stopgap veteran. If Geno does succeed then we don't really need Petty to come in and if Fitzpatrick is a successful stopgap we could still find another successor that isn't petty. I think you can't call Petty a ""long term"" solution when quarterback is still up in the air for the most part. I personally see Petty as a career backup."
nyjets,3d9s31,ThreeCranes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:03:01 2015 UTC,Petty is a very long shot for our long term answer at QB. He is likely going to be our long term answer for backup QB.

nyjets,3d6ck0,Gimaad,3,Mon Jul 13 21:39:04 2015 UTC,Good question. Weird that we have Stacy and not Thomas in his place. Maybe his asking price is too high?
nyjets,3d6ck0,NannigarCire,2,Mon Jul 13 21:55:01 2015 UTC,"i don't think stacy will make the cut. We'll probably end up with Ivory, Ridley, and Powell."
nyjets,3d6ck0,thecakeslayer,4,Mon Jul 13 22:59:31 2015 UTC,"From what I hear, Ridley will start the season on the IR.  Stacy makes the cut from camp.  Also, he was in a crowded backfield last year and he lost playing time to Tre Mason bc of injury.  The year prior, Stacy was a BEAST on a team with no QB, no o-line, and 6 games vs the three top-8 run defenses.  Still almost put up 1000 yards w/7TDs in 12 games.    We are all seriously sleeping on Stacy."
nyjets,3d6ck0,CosmicWy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:46:41 2015 UTC,"so if we keep everybody, that's 4 RBs. We don't need 4.  Even with Stacy's good track record, i don't think he'll make it. Not saying i don't want him to, because he's great. I just don't see us keeping 4 RBs"
nyjets,3d6ck0,thecakeslayer,6,Tue Jul 14 20:19:44 2015 UTC,"Soo here's why I disagree...  Most importantly, Ridley will start the year on the injured reserve.  This means at camp we're looking at a competition between Ivory, Powell, Stacy, Richardson, and camp fodder.  Most likely scenario results in the first three backs make the team.  Next most importantly: skill set overlap.  High-level generalizations:  Bilal is a change of pace/checkdown.  Ivory is a bruise with breakout ability.  Ridey:  see Ivory.  Stacy:  see Ivory plus he has above average hands.   Ivory and Ridley share basically the same size and skill set.  6'-0""/5'-11"" ~225lbs and each catch passes at 55-58%, each have a total of 23 career catches each.       Bilal is the pass catcher right?  109 targets with 65 catches = 59% rate over 4 seasons.  Well, Stacy in essentially 1.5 season has 58 targets and 44 catches.  That puts him around the same pace of targeting but with a 75% catch rate.  Stacy also happens to be a wrecking ball of hurt at 5'-9"", 215lbs.    Stacy's skillsets mean that he overlaps with Powell AND Ivory.  When he is on the field, the playbook will be the largest.  This is good for Chan.   So maybe speed is the differentiating factor which is most important?  40 yard dashes given below.  It isn't.  These guys are all basically the same echelon of speed.  Ivory being the fastest. Ridley being the slowest.  Powell and Stacy essentially equal.    Player 40 yd dash (s)    Chris Ivory 4.48   Bilal Powell 4.52   Zac Stacy 4.55   Stevan Ridley 4.66    What Ivory does have over everyone on the roster is big play ability.  He has the Longest Rush of 80 yards, nearly double everyone else, who live in the 30-40 yard range.  Everyone has about the same ability for longest receptions as well.  Just for fun!: (this i def not most important )    Player Age (years.days)    Zac Stacy 24.096   Stevan Ridley 26.168   Bilal Powell 26.260   Chris Ivory 27.114    Ahhh, but really, most importantly  Zac Stacy costs the Jets $575k and $675k through the end of the 2016 season.   Ridley is on a crazy $750,000 (+ $50,000 workout bonus + $20,000 roster bonus + $350,000 in per-game roster bonuses).  He can be cut a get almost non of his $1.25mil/1-year contract.  Ivory is in the last year of his contract which includes yardage bonus escalators.  Bilal is on a one year deal.  In this situation, the level of financial safety goes:  Stacy, Powel, Ivory, Ridley (from least likely to be cut to most likely - financially).  So I know i said most importantly, but this is the most importantly.  Mike Maccagnan traded a draft pick for Stacy.  I know, it's only a 7th!  However, he could have drafted a position of depth at ANY position.  Instead he traded for a talented RB from a crowded backfield to compete with new RBs in another crowded backfield!  Mac brought in Stacy via trade instead of getting depth anywhere else on the team;  he signed Powell; and he signed Ridley.  Ivory hasn't been selected yet - which honestly doesn't really mean he's not wanted.  So... We've discussed likelihood due to injury, skills, speed, age, cost, and GM emotional involvement.  I think that covers everything!  /u/NannigarCire, how did I do?  I'm dying to see if you do a little gif breakdown.  no pressure.  pending edit:  i gotta publish. maybe i'll proofread later!"
nyjets,3d6ck0,CosmicWy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:24:46 2015 UTC,"You make a good argument. if we do keep all 4, do we keep them for the entire season? or does someone get cut when ridley gets healthy?"
nyjets,3d6ck0,thecakeslayer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:29:25 2015 UTC,"BRB i gotta write a wall of text. :P  Ehh, honestly, I think Ridley is insurance.  Keep him on the IR because it's almost an inevitability that Ivory is going to injure his hamstring."
nyjets,3d6ck0,CosmicWy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:38:57 2015 UTC,That's really all we need. Maybe deal one of the power guys for a pick after camp. Ridley excites me since he has so much talent but Ivory has earned that starting job by beasting for us the last two years. I think one has to go. Four rbs is dumb. They're a dying breed unless they're game changers.
nyjets,3d6ck0,the_furry_stoner,2,Mon Jul 13 23:13:25 2015 UTC,"The only thing that worries me about Ridley, is his injury history. He's a talented guy, but injury prone."
nyjets,3d6ck0,thecakeslayer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:42:28 2015 UTC,Ridley and Ivory reallllly are the same player! minus .1 second on the 40
nyjets,3d6ck0,CosmicWy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:40:54 2015 UTC,then why don't we cut ridley now? we only need multiple Sheldons ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
nyjets,3d6ck0,thecakeslayer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:43:30 2015 UTC,"Of course he won't, but Thomas would and makes more sense to have than Ridley imo. That way we've got Ivory for power running, Powell for pass catching, and Thomas for both."
nyjets,3d6ck0,NannigarCire,2,Tue Jul 14 02:30:31 2015 UTC,"I would check out of film on stacy.  If he can return to 2013 form (last year he had a nagging injury and tre mason/billy cunningham locked up the jobs), Stacy won't just make the team, he can come out as our primary back.  He's a bruiser with speed and hands.  He replaces Ivory, Bilal, and Ridley.  The playbook expands with a player like that on the field."
nyjets,3d6ck0,CosmicWy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:16:51 2015 UTC,"because you're one of the users on this subreddit that i think is knowledgeable, i'll re-watch Stacy's 2013."

I did watch lots of highlights going into this fantasy draft.  i was very high on him.   If you come back and tell me you still think Stacy won't make the team, then consider me swayed.   Still, knowing what he excels at, I love him over all of our backs."
nyjets,3d6ck0,CosmicWy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:28:31 2015 UTC,"My main memories of him come from the 2014 preseason where it was obvious Cunningham had him beat on the ground, but i'll take a look at what the deal is and maybe get together a small gif post of Stacy for the subreddit."

nyjets,3d6ck0,NannigarCire,2,Sun Jul 19 05:47:00 2015 UTC,"The front office has made it pretty clear that they have complete faith in Powell as our 3rd down, pass catching back."
nyjets,3d6ck0,Rugger11,2,Tue Jul 14 04:48:23 2015 UTC,"He didn't played all that much last year as a backup to Ingram (45 total carries and rec), and he's getting up there in years. I'm sure he'll wind up somewhere, but we seem to be set at RB and I really don't see Thomas adding anything we don't already have..."
nyjets,3d6ck0,mikerhoa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:16:10 2015 UTC,Thomas caught 45 passes last year. 77 the year before. Ridley and ivory both have only 23 career receptions. Powell has 65 career receptions.   Pierre Thomas gives us something our offense desperately needs.
nyjets,3d6ck0,CosmicWy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:06:29 2015 UTC,"Yea, but when you look at Stacy and Powell, we have the check down back covered.  Right now between Ridley, Stacy, Powell, and Ivory, I really don't know why we add another RB back into that mix.    I like Pierre a lot, but i think for him to succeed among this group, he would have had to be brought on earlier in the OTA process."
nyjets,3d6ck0,Kozlow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:43:29 2015 UTC,How many backs do we need?
nyjets,3d6ck0,angrypuppy,4,Mon Jul 13 21:50:22 2015 UTC,Powell is the only legitimate pass catching back.  It's something to be concerned about
nyjets,3d6ck0,John_YJKR,3,Mon Jul 13 22:05:35 2015 UTC,Stacy has showed some catching ability when given the opportunity. I'm not sure what the deal was with the him and the rams but he could be more in the running than we think.
nyjets,3d6ck0,angrypuppy,2,Mon Jul 13 23:44:41 2015 UTC,"I hope so.  I'm more excited about him than a lot of others (some people seem to think he'll be a nonfactor, maybe even get cut?)"
nyjets,3d6ck0,John_YJKR,3,Tue Jul 14 00:46:27 2015 UTC,It was a low pick but we traded for him for a reason. I find it a little hard to believe we're just gonna cut him. He'd seriously have to under perform. Honestly I could see us using four back and keep Richardson on the practice squad.
nyjets,3d6ck0,CosmicWy,2,Tue Jul 14 01:06:08 2015 UTC,"if you're excited about stacy, would you mind giving this a read for me?"
nyjets,3d6ck0,CosmicWy,2,Wed Jul 15 03:42:33 2015 UTC,Stacy is statistically the best pass catcher on in the backfield.
nyjets,3d6ck0,Kozlow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:41:35 2015 UTC,"Pierre is a different kind of back than the three headed mixture of Ivory/Ridley/Stacy. They are between the tackle runners for the most part.   He catches the ball out of the backfield, runs screens, and  spent a lot of time lined up in the slot or out wide during his tenure in New Orleans."
nyjets,3d6ck0,mikerhoa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:30:36 2015 UTC,"He will be too expensive, create a glut, and Stacy showed improved hands, and Ridley is capable. I don't feel Thomas is someone that would improve our team as much as the price tag would hurt. Hes also old."

nyjets,3ctwdf,otomotopia,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:29:54 2015 UTC,"Right, I am pretty sure Tebow was in the mix there at one point with the Broncos. I think in terms of overall ability Marshall is the better WR, he has a bigger body and better hands. Decker is an elite #2 borderline #1 WR though. His stats were definitely inflated because of Manning. Cutler and Tebow are definitely closer to skill level to Geno than Manning is"

nyjets,3cq4tm,HotKingChocolate,3,Fri Jul 10 06:11:48 2015 UTC,"This is correct. It's a more antiquated connection now and there certainly are more crossover Mets/Giants or Yankees/Jets fans than there used to be. It's not just that the Jets played at Shea, though - it was built to be a multipurpose stadium for both franchises, and the Giants moved into Yankee Stadium early on and were there for decades before going to the Meadowlands. The connection isn't as obvious to someone looking from the outside in, but those franchise pairs will sort of always be linked."

I went with one friend to a Giants game.  It was a bunch of rich people complaining when people stood up to get into it (at least in that section):  ""Sit down, my fawtha (father) can't see!"".  I went to a Jets game on Thanksgiving night that same year and it was a huge shitshow.  I had SO much fun.  Although I have since calmed down the ""shitshow"" nights, it is a really fond memory.  I officially became a Jets fan that night.  Who cares if they're terrible?  I'll take the savages at a Jets game over other fans any day of the week.  Sorry I don't have a long lineage of loving the pain but that's my version of this story.  My parents didn't indoctrinate me because they are off the boat immigrants and think that shit's dumb."

When the Mets started to look like real contenders, it was impossible to ignore their momentum and, by the time they won, I was rooting for the Mets. After the World Series, there was the inevitable backlash. Accusations of jumping on the bandwagon etc. So, I ditched the Mets and went with the Yankees who were sucking at the time. I went further and picked other teams that were 'less than stellar'. The Jets and the Rangers. Almost thirty years on, the Yanks have paid dividends, the Rangers have won the Stanley Cup. Still waiting for the Jets to come up trumps. High hopes for next season. And when we win, I'll be on that bandwagon, prepared to repel boarders!"

We sat all the way up in the nosebleeds, and with Brooks Bollinger starting, it was foul-mouth city up there and I just fell in love with the atmosphere. Jets obviously lost, but I was hooked.

Mark Gastineau once got me a Gatorade from the locker room because I didn't drink soda and that was all there was in the mini fridge in the trainers office.

If it was really on his mind, sacking Brady would probably have been a goal too.   This seems like another case of the media playing LOLJETS with us, but even then - what do you title the video? ""Eye on DROY - and the Pro Bowl""? That really only interests us. They get more clicks, which equates to more ad revenue, by referencing a Hall of Fame, hugely popular, and controversial player on another team."

nyjets,3ccfta,badassmthrfkr,7,Mon Jul 6 21:42:55 2015 UTC,"Geno is either a high teir 8 or a low teir 7.  Cutler,Kaepernick, A.Smith,Dalton,Flacoo,and Foles are all way better than Geno Smith.  This list is pretty shit in general.  Wilson over Brady,Rivers,and Brees?   Bridgewater over Tannehill, P.Manning,and Stafford?"
nyjets,3ccfta,ThreeCranes,15,Mon Jul 6 22:22:33 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna try to give some explainations cause this mostly what i'd say too based on the tape i've watched.  Brady, Rivers and Brees have been severely overrated the last two years while Wilson has been severely underrated. Especially brees, who's been declining heavily on tape as his accuracy just gets worse and worse. Brady can no longer make 90% of the throws he use to make 5 years ago and has been forced to rely on what few strengths he has left to cover up all the new flaws he has. It's more obvious now how much the system works to protect Brady, with all the quick releases and combination routes (like the famous Ghost/Tosser). The one year Rivers had with Whisenhunt helped cover his own flaws in accuracy and timing, and his pocket presence has been suffering recently. Wilson's accuracy and decision making is Aaron Rodgers-esque when he's at his peak, and his pocket presence is amongst the top in the NFL, and that's without getting into his ability to extend the pocket. The scary part is how much better Wilson can get, since he's got a conservative playbook that will sometimes make a decision for him to not throw a ball he knows he can throw and get in there.  Manning is one of the scariest 2014 tapes to watch. I've never seen a great QB look as bad as he did. People give Manning all the benefit for his name, btu even before his injury his arm was just terrifying to watch. It's just as he says, it looks like it's about to fall off. He's not use to his own sapped arm strength and it shows because his timing is all completely messed up and he begins to panic and lose the ball on some throws. Tannehill has one of the worst intermediate timings in the NFL, which happens to also be the most important area to be good at. Don't know if Bridge is over him since i've never watched, but there's a bunch of reasonings for the rankings.  Foles is terrible, product of a system as it comes. There's no analyst out there saying Foles is anything other than bad to ""not as bad as you think."" Alex Smith is considered by all tape analysts to be the anthesis of everything quarterbacking, and one of the worst starting QBs in the league because of how limiting he is to an offense. It's exactly like Fahey says, he looks away from open receivers because he's scared to throw to them. No one hurts their own offense as much as Alex Smith."
nyjets,3ccfta,NannigarCire,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"I do agree with a couple of your points. I do think Russell Wilson should be given more credit for the Seahawks sucess and could become much better than he already is. Also I do think Peyton  Manning  is set to decline this year.  However I will explain a little bit more on why I disagree with the rankings.  First  of all I'm curious when you say Drew Brees accuracy is ""getting worse"". The past two years Brees completion percentage both rounds to 69%. Sure his arm strength is declining but I don't think you can knock him for accuracy.  Sure Rivers isn't the best in timing but he can still pick you apart regardless.  Even though Brady's arm strength has declined he still has great mechanics/decision making   I'm always kind of low on rookie QBS. Bridgewater did have good acuracy but his TD to INT ratio was meh (14-12)  And my argument for Foles and A.Smith being better than Geno wasn't so much that Foles and A.Smith are so great,its that they're both less erratic  than Geno Smith. Though the more I look at Foles post 2013 the less I like from him."
nyjets,3ccfta,ThreeCranes,2,Tue Jul 7 19:25:26 2015 UTC,"Stats support Brees not declining but nothing on tape supports that he hasn't hit a severe decline. Just like Brady, he's become more dependent on his scheme covering his issues and just like Brady, his scheme is very good at covering his issues. His problems have come from consistently missing the placement on throws, even if they're caught. That's something Wilson doesn't have an issue with.  Rivers can pick you apart, but that doesn't mean he's better than Wilson at doing it. Rivers accuracy has become more and more erratic in recent years and the ball seems to be slipping away from him every now and then when he throws now. Wilson doesn't have these issues.  Brady's arm strength, ball placement, velocity, everything has declined. Even his pocket presence has gotten worse as he's become even less mobile than he previously was. Wilson doesn't have these issues.  When looking at players like Cian Fahey does, the numbers are meaningless and what's important is making the distinction between Quarterbacks skills and their system, and that's only done through tape. It's why these rankings don't seem to make sense to a lot of people because the numbers don't line up with the rankings, but most people also have no idea how to separate players skills from the situation those players are in (and if you look online at most tape analysts rankings of QBs, they only get harder to agree with because this is very, very, tame). There are very few people in the tape realm for example that think Stafford is as good of a quarterback as his numbers are. Most would have him as average.  Speaking of Alex Smith again, if Geno was replaced with Smith on that offense, he'd be producing and playing way better than Smith. That's the idea of why Geno is ranked higher. Same goes with if Geno had been playing in place of Foles."
nyjets,3ccfta,NannigarCire,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:11:20 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I agree with Aaron Rodgers' synopsis. That's a bold call considering his offense put up 6 points in the second half of the NFCCG. I know one game isn't the whole season, but when you're talking about the best season by a QB ever it certainly plays a role."
nyjets,3ccfta,Andaroodle,2,Tue Jul 7 01:54:23 2015 UTC,"Eh, they took the foot off the gas the second half which I'd put on the coaches more than Aaron Rodgers. Not to be a dick, but Tom Brady only put up 14 points in the Super Bowl of one of the best seasons by a QB, so looking at one game isn't fair."

Flacco is literally a better version of Geno Smith. Dalton isn't that great but he isn't nearly that bad. I understand the rest of the list. I mean if you just watch Geno's redzone hesitations, it's really hard to buy him as being on the tier above Flacco."

Most sane people would at least take Flacco, Kaepernick, Dalton, and Alex Smith over Geno in half of one second.  I'd also take Griffin, Winston, Mariota, Foles, and Carr over him as well.  You're telling me he's on the same level as Stafford, come on now. Also what good games did Geno have at the end of the year besides the Dolphins one?  The Vikings one was okay, but he did throw that pick six at the beginning in a game they lost in overtime.  Also the Pats game was okay, but there were so many missed opportunities that game, and the way he took that sack at the end was just backbreaking.  Everyone keeps trying to grasp at straws to find some way to justify his bad play.  Maybe he's just not that good.  The bad completely outweighs the good with Geno, and while I really want him to break through this season, I'm not very hopeful."

If you were expecting 3 wins with a plus or minus of one, you're starting to len towards minus. Richardson was a key component agaisnt the run. There's a solid additional yard the defense gives up  on run plays without Sheldon. Williams is a great prospect, but Richardson is a known entity and a dominate force.   Giving that up is a blow."

nyjets,3c0u1i,aintevenmadbrah,4,Sat Jul 4 00:42:07 2015 UTC,Four games is the difference between a playoff and not. If we won 3 of those 4 games we would be in a great spot for making the post season.

nyjets,3c0u1i,frexistential,8,Sun Jul 5 14:48:32 2015 UTC,"It's not panic, it's the expression of disappointment.  I've gotten slack for calling Richardson an idiot in the past. The whole ""timeout"" incident further solidified my opinion of the man. That said, he's a great player.  The problem is that he's paid millions of dollars to follow a set of rules (archaic as they may be) and to play football. He has not lived up to his end of the bargain. It doesn't help that he didn't show up for voluntary camp, it paints the picture that he was at home smoking joints instead of doing his job.  Throw in the fact that we have a new head coach and a new defensive system and now you have yourself an issue.  Also, Mo just gained some real leverage in contract negotiations."
nyjets,3c0u1i,southorange,5,Fri Jul 3 19:36:03 2015 UTC,Two things. Sheldon was at some of the workouts. Second. This likely does nothing for mo. This is a 4 game suspension. Wilk is under contract potentially for 2 more seasons before a deal must get done. He position is not strengthened at all as a result of this. The only change is we will see a lot more of Williams earlier than we thought. It may not be a bad thing. And that actually will weaken wilks leverage if Williams is good.
nyjets,3c0u1i,John_YJKR,2,Fri Jul 3 20:50:47 2015 UTC,How can you assume we can reasonably afford the franchise tag? We're pretty cap strapped next season. We do that and we may not even be able to sign a middling free agent.
nyjets,3c0u1i,jetsfan07,2,Fri Jul 3 20:51:57 2015 UTC,I'm Betting an extension deal is done before next season. Mac knows what he's doing.

If both sides can not come to an agreement on a number the deal will not get done, there is no GM magic when it comes to this unless the player really wants to stay."
nyjets,3c0u1i,games456,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:43:21 2015 UTC,We have money for an extension. It doesn't need to get done now. Wilk stated he wants to stay. You buy too much into the media hype on this one.

nyjets,3c0u1i,games456,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:35:57 2015 UTC,So what is your point then other than wilk is lying when he says he wants to retire a jet?
nyjets,3c0u1i,John_YJKR,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:43:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think he is lying when he says he wants to retire a Jet, the two are not mutually exclusive. I think he (and most players) would love to play for one team their entire career but only if they are paid what they are worth (or think they are worth).  I am saying that I trust in Mac to not make bad decisions, but that does not mean he will able to magically sign Wilkerson to a team friendly contract. I do not think mac wants to extend him yet regardless of what he says. Better to just wait out till mid season to see what happens, not with just the d-line either. Imagine if Geno turns it around and becomes decent, that changes everything.  The risk here is also that I think with this defense Wilkerson is going to have a really good season not to mention the however irrational bump all players on a good defense get in perceived value. If that happens his value might even go up by mid season. Which would suck for us."

nyjets,3c0u1i,jetsfan07,4,Sat Jul 4 05:58:04 2015 UTC,"The cap has gone up 10 millions dollars for the past 3 years, Mo's franchise will be about 8 million more than he's making now.  We're a little less than 5 million under now, whatever we don't spend carries over.  If Fitz doesn't finish the season as a starter, he won't be back, that another 3 million.  And who said anything about signing all our players?  We're just talking about Mo.  I like the set up, a lot of guys are playing for their spot on the team.  If Cro has a bad year, he's gone saving 7m.  If Marshall has a bad year, he's gone saving more than 7m.  If Breno underperforms, gone saving 4m.  My point being whoever proves worthy of coming back, we bring back.  We're not stuck with any dead weight.  If Mo goes out and has a great season, that's an awesome problem to have and we'll take care of it.  If Snacks Harrison has a career year or Leonard Williams proves the real deal we'll have a decision to make and we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.  Every team goes through it."

nyjets,3c0u1i,ynksjts,2,Fri Jul 3 19:11:50 2015 UTC,"Who is panicking? People are a little pissed off as they should be. Also Richardson is a proven play-maker and having them on the field (or not) can change the outcome of a game.   Williams while a great prospect is just that, an unproven rookie that we will have to depend on more these first 4 games than we would have needed to if Richardson was not suspended.  Also Holmes was an addition to the team so although he missed the first 4 games his addition was a net positive. This is simply a self inflicted loss.  Who knows, maybe we win the first game in 2010 instead of losing 10-9 if we had Holmes."

This most likely happened at OTAs. The players all know when it is happening and need to stop smoking for a few months before this. He most likely thought it would be out of his system or pushed it too close to the deadline. Just don't smoke pot before testing and you are free to smoke during the season. Now that he has been suspended for his own stupidity, he may be one the substance of abuse list where he will now be tested regularly."

Richardson was the best pass rusher we had for his position. As good as Williams is right now, the ability to come in and dominate as a rusher is way harder than as a run defender.  The loss of Richardson's pass rush could be the game changing difference in that one score loss we get in the first four games, and every game counts really really hard- especially in a season like this and on a team like ours that has really loaded up to try and go far this year. I'd be a little nervous until Williams gets his first sack."

nyjets,3bwcw4,dumbego,2,Fri Jul 3 04:07:16 2015 UTC,"i don't think we should be pissed at him. we're not entitled to his service and football is the most dangerous, debilitating sport on the planet. we don't know when he failed a test or how much was in his system. currently the nfl is 4x stricter on thc blood content than the ioc committee- which is fucking absurd.   i know nfl fan culture is definitely the most mainstream, common-minded but let's be real for a minute here- this just makes the nfl look behind the times. say all the negative, dramatic statements you want about winning or not taking the risk- but at the end of the day, you have no idea what it's like to be one of these guys. you don't know what its like to deal with the constant, nagging pain and discomfort that nfl players deal with every moment of their day. if these guys have to smoke to get through the day in the offseason, then i have no problem with it. maybe the 4 games off will even help extend his career. you would never see this shit in the nba because that league has it's shit together."
nyjets,3bwcw4,ranch_dressing_hose,8,Fri Jul 3 12:26:16 2015 UTC,"There's other, legal ways to deal with chronic pain. And fair enough, marijuana is legal in many states now, so as long as he wasn't breaking a law, it's a free country. But technically, yes, the team is entitled to his service by virtue of having signed a contract with him. Part of that is abiding by the rules of the NFL. Sure, he isn't getting paid for the 4 games he's out. But that makes the Jets worse for those 4 games. And considering how much he talked about being focused on winning last year, for him to go do something that jeopardizes his and the team's ability to win seems pretty hypocritical."
nyjets,3bwcw4,dumbego,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:50:53 2015 UTC,"maybe you can tell me more about these better, legal ways of dealing with pain because i'm sure you'd have the entire league's attention.   the team is not entitled to your service. no one is. you don't have to show up if you don't want to- that's why we see so many god damn hold outs in this league.   the only argument that i see as valid against this is him putting the team's winning percentage in jeopardy. the jets are not a better team without richardson, that is obvious. however, i think it's pretty clear the man made a personal choice regarding this."

nyjets,3bwcw4,ranch_dressing_hose,0,Fri Jul 3 04:44:36 2015 UTC,"so many guys in the nfl smoke weed that it's impossible to get an accurate percentage estimate. you can't make it a question of his integrity without making it a question of the entire league's integrity.   you also don't know what its like to work for an employer that makes you destroy your body EVERY SINGLE DAY and then tell you that any and every painkiller is off limits. sheldon richardson loves football, not the nfl. he is loyal to himself, not the league that makes a fool of itself every single day. if he feels that this is what he needs to do to get through the chronic pain he deals with then more power to him. i think its very clear that richardson chooses well-being over one month's pay at this point."
nyjets,3bwcw4,anon5848,-5,Fri Jul 3 00:38:58 2015 UTC,man have you ever broke a rule your employer had.

nyjets,3bwcw4,TheMelroseDiner,3,Fri Jul 3 12:55:21 2015 UTC,"Are you serious? Your comparisons aren't really parallels. Marijuana use is a rule the nfl strictly enforces. They test for it. He knew he could've gotten caught. Again it's not a question of whether you agree with the rule or not.  It was bargained by the nflpa. He was aware of the rule,  and the strictness in which it is enforced, and still chose to smoke weed. It was irresponsible and he deserves the punishment.   I actually think Marijuana should be legal, I personally don't agree with the rule. I also don't agree with rules at my job,  but that doesn't mean I don't adhere to them or argue the punishments after the fact because I don't agree with the punishment"

nyjets,3bwkew,John_YJKR,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:53:57 2015 UTC,"Not saying that it gave them that big of an edge offensively, but someone pointed out that since the guy who called himself the ""deflator"" started working for the Patriots, they've had the fewest amount of fumbles/turnovers in the nfl. It's definitely easier to hold on to an under-inflated ball"
nyjets,3bwkew,DeBlaz07,2,Fri Jul 3 20:08:02 2015 UTC,Could simply be correlation not causation. Since before and during his time working with them the patriots have been one of the most winning and high scoring teams. Isn't it more likely they had/have good players with good coaching. And that's why there were fewer fumbles. I recognize they cheated and they should be punished. Rules are rules. Just like these players and smoking weed. But the idea that the pats success is not overwhelmingly attributed to great play and coaching is insulting and borderline ridiculous.

nyjets,3bsi4a,John_YJKR,17,Wed Jul 1 21:39:36 2015 UTC,Watching the guys that buffalo has been signing is really telling in regards to how much say Rex has when it comes to players. Makes you rethink who you blamed each time a given player was signed.
nyjets,3bsi4a,ridunkulous,5,Wed Jul 1 21:54:57 2015 UTC,or maybe Bills don't have anything left on their salary cap so Bills (coach doesn't make the entire decision) are just signing cheap players that may help their team.
nyjets,3bsi4a,John_YJKR,8,Wed Jul 1 22:46:03 2015 UTC,It's a lot of Ryan retreads though.
nyjets,3bsi4a,ridunkulous,3,Wed Jul 1 22:46:40 2015 UTC,"I don't see any problem with that. He's just getting bench players and just signing players who fit his system for cheap price.  Now if he's overpaying them or if he's signing a major part of the team who just doesn't seem to fit, i would have problems.   I wouldn't mind wayne hunter as 7,8th olineman tbh.

Some believe he could've made a push for 1st rd in next years draft. He was cited for marijuana earlier this year and has some temper issues having punched an opposing player last year during a game.  Maybe offer a 4th and see if we get him?"

nyjets,3bjq9t,nickmangoldsbeard,2,Mon Jun 29 21:52:23 2015 UTC,Matt Harvey would be a good choice.

nyjets,3bjq9t,delis16,2,Mon Jun 29 21:07:09 2015 UTC,I'm a fan of Damon Harrison. He is a great nose tackle that started as an udfa. His story is pretty compelling - followed a coach and played at junior college despite it being a serious threat to his chance to make the nfl

nyjets,3bjq9t,jrfoxe,-4,Tue Jun 30 01:25:07 2015 UTC,"I'm going Calvin Pryor or Zac Stacy...maybe even Jace Amaro for namesake, heh. Pryor is safest bet for long-term star, Stacy I think has best shot to make a name for himself and take the starter RB duties for some time. Just my personal opinion..."
nyjets,3bhz4c,Vaedur,7,Mon Jun 29 11:16:31 2015 UTC,"Jarvis Harrison, barring a ridiculously bad training camp, is making the roster. If he gets cut, he will be picked up by another team. The team will keep at least 8 OLinemen. Other than that, the rest is fairly reasonable. I think Posey might have a better shot than we think cause Mac knows him from Houston (and I think drafted him). Also, I have a feeling that Manieri is more a camp body than a legitimate challenger for a TE spot - that last spot will probably go to Sexton. Random hunch that Cumberland might be cut - new regime has no ties to him and Sexton is a very promising UDFA"
nyjets,3bhz4c,Nebkreb,4,Mon Jun 29 15:04:11 2015 UTC,"Things I disagree with.  The Sixth reciving spot is tough to predict but I don't think Powell makes it. Powell wasn't that good in returning punts(something that I think  Kerley will be asked to do) and while Owusu has a smaller sample size he looked  better in kickoff returns. DeVier Posey wins it if you ask me,Maccagnan liked him enough not only to draft him in the third round but to trade for him as well with Quincy Enunwa coming in close due to his blocking ability.Rumph is just a camp body I think Enunwa,Evans,Hakim,and Grahm all have a better chances of being the practice squad wide receivers than Rumph  I disagree with the offensive line projections. First of all they didn't even list Ben Ijalana I find that odd. While I think Aboushi beats out Colon I still think Colon because of him being a veteran. I don't think Maccagnan risks putting Harrison on the pratice squad,he may get offers. I think Brewer/Ijalana serve as the backup tackles with Colon/Harrison being backup guards,and Dozier moving to backup center with Ben Qvale on the pratice squad."
nyjets,3bhz4c,ThreeCranes,3,Mon Jun 29 18:31:57 2015 UTC,I'm not the most knowledgeable in the area of rosters (or anything else for that matter) but what are the chances of us carrying 7 WRs instead of 6? I could see there being far more need for depth here than say tight-end if we're expecting a lot of 3/4 WR plays...
nyjets,3bhz4c,bashfoc2,2,Mon Jun 29 16:41:07 2015 UTC,"I think keeping 7 WRs is a possibility with us given the versatility in our group, but if we keep 7 where do we cut out players of different positions?"
nyjets,3bhz4c,Assjuic3,3,Mon Jun 29 18:42:17 2015 UTC,"I doubt we will keep four running backs and a FB. Plus we are most likely keeping Posey as our #5 or 6. Mac drafted him and made it a point to trade for him. Plus Walter Powell was not very good. I'd have Enunwa there too. Lots of raw ability and was starting to see playing time down the stretch last year. Cumby could get cut for Sexton, similar players and smaller cap hit. Harrison should be on the team, he will get picked off immediately by some other team if cut."
nyjets,3bhz4c,Rugger11,2,Mon Jun 29 19:19:56 2015 UTC,I think Shaq Evans and TJ Graham will make it over Owusu and Walter Powell. Jarvis Harrison already been talked about but him also
nyjets,3bhz4c,anon5848,2,Mon Jun 29 18:50:35 2015 UTC,"Bohanon as a fan favorite is an absolute joke, I haven't seen anyone that really even wants to keep him on the team."

nyjets,3bhz4c,sneakyfrankie,5,Mon Jun 29 12:45:06 2015 UTC,Looks like he's projected to get cut.

nyjets,3bhz4c,sneakyfrankie,0,Mon Jun 29 16:43:55 2015 UTC,Personally I think they should use 2qbs then the emergency can be a st/wr who has college QB experience ala brad smith

nyjets,3b4stn,_vsrs_,28,Thu Jun 25 23:42:12 2015 UTC,"No, they have completely different skill sets. All four of our top WRs bring different things to the table and compliment each other very well. I don't understand why fans are so quick to ask if we should cut or trade players now that we finally built depth at the position."
nyjets,3b4stn,Rugger11,22,Thu Jun 25 23:56:23 2015 UTC,All four of our top WRs bring different things to the table and compliment each other very well   Agreed plus Gailey runs a lot of 4 receiver sets.
nyjets,3b4stn,ThreeCranes,3,Fri Jun 26 00:21:05 2015 UTC,That was my thought.  Everyone keeps talking about how Gailey runs a spread offense... well you need weapons to run that type of offense and we finally have them.  Why would we get rid of anyone.
nyjets,3b4stn,c39j8b,21,Fri Jun 26 17:44:49 2015 UTC,"Do we drop Kerley?   I hate how people think bringing in new talent means you have to get rid of old talent. That isn't how teams get better. Here's the gist of the story: Smith will be on the bench. Kerley will work out of the slot. In some formations, Marshall will move to the slot, Eric to Marshall's spot, and Smith to Eric's spot, and Kerley to the bench."
nyjets,3b4stn,viewless25,8,Fri Jun 26 01:23:37 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Kerley has shown he can play outside as well. If the top CB moves to the slot to cover Marshall and Decker gets the #2, Kerley should have no problem with a #3 outside. He got over 800 yards playing mostly on the outside Shanchez's second to last year."

nyjets,3b4stn,Rugger11,7,Fri Jun 26 22:32:21 2015 UTC,Kerley will most likely be the WR3 or slot receiver until Smith develops into a more complete receiver . I'm not trying to say all he offers to the team is a deep threat but during his rookie year he will be used a lot as a deep threat . Down the road I would fully expect him to have a bigger role in the offence and take kerley's spot . If kerley has a similar season to last year I can see him gone in 2-3 years . But for the sake of all of us #KeepKerley .
nyjets,3b4stn,CrunchyNar,9,Thu Jun 25 23:57:02 2015 UTC,"No matter what Smith does, he isn't going to ""take Kerley's spot"" because they are completely different types of receivers."
nyjets,3b4stn,Rugger11,6,Fri Jun 26 02:39:44 2015 UTC,"Our loadout going into the season will probably look like   WR1: Marshall   WR2: Decker  WR3: Kerley/Smith   WR4: Camp winner #1/#2   You'll likely see different combos of WR1-3, with the occasional swap in for WR4.   The thing is, Smith brings that long distance threat to the table. I'd expect him to get some serious time this year. He won't necessarily replace Kerley, but he will bring something that Kerley can't.   Also our offence might run some 4WR sets, so both receivers might see some serious time no matter what (barring injury of course)."
nyjets,3b4stn,rvbcaboose1018,-12,Fri Jun 26 04:42:59 2015 UTC,Wrong.  Devin Smith was brought in for his speed.  Both Decker & Marshall are too old/slow to provide separation for each other.  So it will be more like:  WR1:  Smith  (deep route decoy)  WR2/WR3:  Marshall/Decker  WR4/WR5:  Kerley/Amaro or RB  Did everyone forget that Gailey runs spread offenses?  Kerley is going to play many offensive downs with slot routes traditionally like a WR3.
nyjets,3b4stn,sameolejets,12,Fri Jun 26 05:30:17 2015 UTC,Lol Smith will not be the WR 1 / X Receiver
nyjets,3b4stn,HaruSoul,6,Fri Jun 26 12:52:10 2015 UTC,Hopefully in like 3 years he will be. But for now hell no.
nyjets,3b4stn,woodchips24,2,Fri Jun 26 13:33:02 2015 UTC,"Fuck that, hopefully he's good enough to be a legit WR 1 next year. But yeah, he's nowhere near ready to unseat Marshall/Decker now."
nyjets,3b4stn,theblueisglue25,2,Fri Jun 26 18:12:38 2015 UTC,Oh I hope next year. I'm just trying to be realistic

nyjets,3b4stn,CosmicWy,6,Fri Jun 26 16:30:48 2015 UTC,Jesus.  Even if Smith takes the number 3 spot why would they cut Kerley?  What if any of those 3 get injured?

nyjets,3b8ael,CoywolfExpress,8,Fri Jun 26 19:47:07 2015 UTC,"The last time a successful QB wasn't re-signed by the team that drafted them was Brees who was dealing with a shoulder issue while a first round pick sat behind him. The chance of Wilson, a player with no issues on or off the field who already has a superbowl ring not getting re-signed is just a minuscule amount above 0. They'll cut and restructure almost every contract before they let him go. Lynch will leave before Wilson."

nyjets,3b8ael,ocyries,3,Fri Jun 26 20:08:34 2015 UTC,"You've never watched Wilson closely enough if you think he's a glorified game manager. The only reason he's not seen as the passing god he can actually be is because the team doesn't ask him to be that player. Watch the throws he threads and his decision making skills, his ball placement, god he made some UDFA look like a star in the superbowl. Don't kid yourself about him being a game manager.

As good as Sheldon Richardson is, he's not J. J. Watt or even Suh.  4)  If the team has every intention of using Sheldon as an FB in rare, desperate situations, he still needs reps.  5)  So, you're saying you prefer the Jets go 9-7, rather than 10-6, and miss the playoffs, because you insist that Richardson not be used to save a crucial Jets drive?"

nyjets,3b13zy,sameolejets,3,Thu Jun 25 19:42:57 2015 UTC,"First of all, Woodys main job is his company, Johnson & Johnson. It is his main source of income. If anything, the Jets are a side gig. Being named finance chairman IS Woodys way of getting involved in the political sphere. (You don't have to be a politician to be directly involved) and I would bet Woody cares more about the success of his company than he does the Jets. And if this isolates his fans, or offends them in any way, it's not like it really matters.   I would be very surprised to see people stop going to games/supporting the Jets because Woody is part of Jebs campaign. I am a jets fan. And I sure as hell do not support Jeb."

What you're not grasping is that Woody is not an ubermenschen.  Very few people would be capable of keeping tabs on a multimillion dollar fortune, properly appreciate & provide guidance for a football franchise, and properly be a financial chairman for a POTUS candidate.  There's not enough hours in the day, and Woody is not that talented.  It is mismanagement by overjuggling.  Furthermore, if the ultimate desire is to be in the spotlight, owning a failing sports franchise and running the fundraising for a POTUS candidate is not synergistic!  A misstep on either side can negatively affect the other.  If Woody really cares about his politics, sell the team.  If he won't sell, and still insists on taking real political jobs, then I'm going to call him out for being a fucktard."

nyjets,3b0uu5,Shrimpola_Cola,0,Thu Jun 25 12:08:37 2015 UTC,They added a bunch of playmakers in free agency including a future hall of famer.  They didn't lose anyone important (I love Sudfeld but I think they'll be fine).  They added a gnarly defensive lineman and a burner receiver who should make an impact from day one.  They dumped their incompetent coach and have an  easier schedule.  Geno was looking better at the end of last year and shut the fuck up it wasn't because of Harvin.  I don't see how the Jets doing well should surprise anyone.
nyjets,3b029a,wildhaymaker,3,Wed Jun 24 21:54:00 2015 UTC,"What i can tell you from my tape study of Geno about this is that he hesitates to make the decision to throw, so spreading out the field and getting the defense to give him more widened throwing lanes will help cover that flaw- if he doesn't fix it himself.  *here's an example;  http://gfycat.com/LimpBronzeKingsnake  Spread formation, all the crossing routes make all the Dolphins linebackers hesistate and safety hesitates between Kerley and Cumberland so Geno's able to fit the ball through to Kerley for a big gain."
nyjets,3b029a,NannigarCire,9,Wed Jun 24 22:07:15 2015 UTC,"That's a 25 yard throw that hits Kerley in stride as well. Read the hot route well without giving it away too early.  If you look at nearly all the gifs where Geno preforms well, they're on 3/4 man spreads.  Example one  Example two  Example three  Example four, not the best but gives me HUGE hopes for the Decker/Marshall connection  Example five  Example six =(  Example seven  He's got great decision making when its a spread play. The additional talent and focus on this type of offense can help Geno out, because the gaps will be just that much wider and the coverage should be slightly more hesitant."
nyjets,3b029a,otomotopia,4,Thu Jun 25 00:05:47 2015 UTC,"Geno's decision making in general is pretty solid from his second year. Once you even the playing field of his lack of decisiveness and give the defense a reason to be indecisive, suddenly Geno looks legit. All good gifs btw."

nyjets,3b029a,justadude11,5,Thu Jun 25 03:40:00 2015 UTC,"yeah. Geno's problem for a majority of the season was in his timing and placement, but the actual method of coming to the decision to making the throws he made were more often than not the right ones. Obviously there's still lapses in judgement, like the two interceptions in the Bears game, but every QB has those."

Last season Rex had all of the players come to the game together in a bus, and they would all walk past fans when entering the stadium, however I doubt Bowles does that this season, I guess the best bet would be to find a way to where the players park and find them after the game.

The High Line is something I would recommend you to check out and is free. It's an above ground park that was transformed from abandoned elevated rail lines.  Go downtown to the East Village or Alphabet city for some nice bars. I would also recommend hopping over on the 7 train to Vernon Blvd and come check Gantry Plaza state park for an awesome view of the city. Brooklyn Bridge park is also pretty sweet. Go to the west side around 30th street and catch one of those boat tours that takes you around the city, it's breathtaking and fairly affordable.

nyjets,3azfux,Itsascrnnam,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:46:11 2015 UTC,"Nope. A gunner's responsibility is to rush down the field to try and get to the opponent's tackler first. It does not require ball skills a returner would have to have. Gunners just need to be able to run fast, receivers need to be able to catch and handle the kickoff and have enough vision to move down the open field. Also, being a WR and having those sort of ball skills does not mean it would translate to a returner's ball skills. For a rookie WR who has never done this before, it might be the best use of time to take him away from WR duties to teach ST."
nyjets,3azfux,Rugger11,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:37:10 2015 UTC,"I know the difference between the two, but from what I can recall a lot of guys in the past have played both positions. I believe Cribbs did, Hester I think has played some gunner, Cro, Hakim, in sure there are more."
nyjets,3azfux,Itsascrnnam,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:43:40 2015 UTC,"Cribbs and Hester were more ST guys than offensive guys so they needed to be flexible and as versatile as they could on ST. Smith is not one of those guys. And I don't know if you can say allot of guys played both. Some, ok, but allot seems way too high without some statistics to back it up. Just for us, Kerley is our PR and he doesn't take snaps at gunner. Smith needs all the time he can get to transition to a pro WR, not waste time splitting reps at a position he has never played before that we don't know if he'd even be good at."

The other was TE Zach Sudfeld, who we lost to a training camp injury.   Mauldin should be a good addition though. We are keeping Reilly, which is also key. Devin Smith is actually a very good gunner on special teams. He's a guy who you'd send after the punt returner on the sidelines. Should be a positive impact to our special teams.  Expect to see Saalim ""The Dream"" Hakim as a kickoff returner, Jeremy Kerley catching punts again, and Walter Powell doing both. We'll see if Smith can do punt returns, but I don't expect that to happen."
nyjets,3azfux,otomotopia,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:20:00 2015 UTC,Is Walter Powell still with the team? I wasn't impressed by him.
nyjets,3azfux,John_YJKR,2,Wed Jun 24 20:59:32 2015 UTC,"He's still with the team, yes. He was awful at punt returns, going for only a 4 yard average on 12 attempts but was good enough at kickoff returns (8 attempts, 233 yards at a ~30 average) to keep a roster spot for another year.   That was his rookie year, after all."

Hoping someone emerges as a stud; always helpful to have an explosive and reliable kick returner!"

The greatest coaches always preached the importance of special teams. I never said it was 1/3 of all the plays of the game; however, a very smart man who knows more about football than all of us on this board combined uses this old adage on a daily basis with his players."

nyjets,3ayy2u,CoywolfExpress,3,Wed Jun 24 18:19:22 2015 UTC,"you can't have the skill to play in the NFL and not read an NFL defense. those are contradicting statements. Geno's read NFL defenses plenty so far anyway, turn on any coaches tape on gamerewind and it's pretty visible."
nyjets,3ayy2u,NannigarCire,-1,Wed Jun 24 19:27:34 2015 UTC,"Yea he reads them badly and screws up the ol assignments. Then he telegraphs a bad throw into a defenders hands.. he has the physical skill (like 99% of any drafted QB) but lacks the mental skill to keep up in the nfl... at that level they are all physically gifted but what separates a bad to good to great QB is all mental. Oh, and I've watched his tape a lot... I watched all his scouting tape all his pro tape. The kid is TERRIBLE at the position, he can throw a nice deep ball when there is ZERO pressure but that's about it. And I refuse to allow games against the Falcons D (what a fucking joke they have been the last 4 years), the Raiders (seriously anybody who thinks geno deserves another shot based of his performance against the Raiders is a moron), and the final get of the season against the dolphins when neither team had anything to play for to influence my opinion of him in a positive way, those games might as well have been preseason.  But let's look at his mental ability shall we? He has not improved his footwork at all (let's see what it looks like this year but I doubt it has gotten better), his decision making and inability to read defensive schemes has put a serious hurting on the OL (hard to block when you're QB is giving you the wrong assignments) which equals more pressure on him, which leads to his WORST in the league INT percentage of a whooping 4.2%. He gets so scared at the line that he stares down and forces throws to his #1 target every. single. time. He misses meetings, didn't want to stay for the second day of the draft, deflects blame onto other, called a flight attendant racist, cursed at fans, and oh do you remember the butt fumble 2.0? https://youtu.be/Eno0i_xKa_w This kid doesn't belong in the nfl"
nyjets,3ayy2u,CoywolfExpress,9,Wed Jun 24 19:46:49 2015 UTC,"If you've watched his tape and still think this, i think you're not watching the tape and just confirming your bias. Geno's deep ball is just NFL adequate. He arcs it too much and doesn't have the ability to rope it, and his accuracy with it is just passable. So i don't know how you've seen his tape and then said some of the things you've said.  What's the issues with his footwork in these?  http://gfycat.com/GratefulLinearEnglishpointer  http://gfycat.com/FrigidThriftyIsabellinewheatear  http://gfycat.com/AffectionateWarmEft  http://www.gfycat.com/UnlinedWellgroomedChrysomelid  http://www.gfycat.com/GrotesqueBeneficialKingfisher  looks like the drop syncs up to his first read every time to me. Can you prove that his footwork hasn't gotten better, cause all of those look better than anything from his first year.  Geno doesn't give blocking assignments, Mangold does. He doesn't stare either, in fact Geno drops back and stares down the middle of the field to hold the safety and then looks at his first read consistently.  Here's three plays i linked in another thread from just one drive (the second drive in the Chicago game) where he goes past his first read. it's really easy to find more, so please ask if you need more.  https://gfycat.com/DamagedWeeAustralianshelduck   https://gfycat.com/FearfulParallelHoverfly   https://gfycat.com/SlimWanCub   I think you've got more anti-geno bias than learned information. Its good to see that you ""don't believe any games against easy defenses influence your decision"" cause i think that shows that you're paying more attention to the result of his plays than the process that goes into them."

nyjets,3ayy2u,sharked,-1,Wed Jun 24 17:56:54 2015 UTC,"Geno is the one attempting to read the defense and call out blitz's. I appreciate the time you've taken to put this together and trust me when I say I wanted him to be the answer but he will never be an above average QB and that isn't good enough to win a title. I seriously doubt he will ever start again after this year unless a real starter gets hurt. He has what it takes to be a good back up but nothing more, definitely not someone you can rely on. But you also missed a bunch of things I said, the 4.2% int percentage for starters, he has thrown significantly less passes than any other starting QB the last two year and yet has almost the most ints. He has zero leadership skill and while yes he does spend a lot of time going over tape it hasn't seemed to help him at all (remember he looked really good at the end of his rookie year too before stumbling last year and getting benched) but yes his footwork may sync up to his first read but what about after the play takes longer than 3 seconds? He steps over himself or misplants every other step. He rarely recovers from moving in the pocket to reset his feet and ends up driving the ball with the nose down off his front foot. Plus, seriously why in the world would you allow someone who had the butt fumble 2.0 to continue starting."
nyjets,3ayy2u,CoywolfExpress,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:16:41 2015 UTC,So... You just regurgitated everything you said in your first post... K.
nyjets,3ayy2u,CosmicWy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:08:25 2015 UTC,"Because every QB has boneheaded plays in their career. Geno rarely calls out anything to the O-line, you've seen the tape right? Mangold is the one pointing out everything, didn't you notice him constantly nudging Colon/Aboushi and giving them info? I don't care about the numbers, the tape is all i'm caring about- and who cares if his feet are getting misplaced when the issues he's having aren't related to his timing via footwork? if you're just going to read into the technical details of his footwork and ignore that there's no actual issue that's being resulted from them (because he still rotates his hip into every throw and goes through a full motion, even if you don't like the technical details of his steps in his 2nd and 3rd reads, and his feet continue to sync up to his second and third reads) then what's the point? Now, Geno doesn't reset well when he's flustered but neither do many other NFL QBs. Also, i don't understand the criticism of driving the ball with his front foot, you're supposed to step into the throw and he does."
nyjets,3ayy2u,NannigarCire,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:11:43 2015 UTC,"You obviously don't understand how to throw a football lol pointing the nose down throws off the spiral, you are supposed to throw off your back foot for power and accuracy, the front foot is for balance... his footwork matters a lot because without proper footwork it doesn't matter if the timing is synced because his feet are in the wrong place to get an accurate throw out. Not to mention that it physically slows a person down and is currently preventing him from being faster than he is."
nyjets,3ayy2u,CoywolfExpress,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:40:19 2015 UTC,"The backfoot isn't power, hip rotation is power. I'm not saying anything about the nose-down because i've never seen it, but i'd appreciate a gif or video or something where it's clearly visible cause i've heard other people say it before too. His feet don't end up being in the wrong place often, and again, the argument to begin with was ""his footwork never improved from his first year"" which was obviously untrue."
nyjets,3awkdj,giobbistar21,15,Wed Jun 24 02:05:56 2015 UTC,"Rex and his myriad of offensive coordinators weren't precisely conducive to developing quarterback talent. I think under new leadership, Geno has a chance to be a top 16 QB. He possesses enough physical skills to be successful, now it's a question of elevating the mental side of the game to match his physical tools."
nyjets,3awkdj,bradtoughy,4,Wed Jun 24 03:18:15 2015 UTC,Myriad of offensive coordinators   Geno only played under Mornhinweg.
nyjets,3awkdj,woodchips24,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"True, but that wasn't the point. Rex tried several offensive schemes during his tenure with the Jets and none of them were overly successful. Whether is was Schottenheimer, Sporano or Mornhinweg, from the day Rex arrived, it never truly felt like the Jets were going to get great quarterback play. And they used some prime draft picks on QBs during Rex's tenure.  From 2009 to present, the Jets had problems identifying and developing talent at the offensive skill positions."
nyjets,3awkdj,bradtoughy,9,Wed Jun 24 18:27:38 2015 UTC,"So I have supported Geno even when he was at WVU, and I still believe he has the potential to be an above average quarterback. I really like the way that he can throw a good deep ball, and if I had to say what he does the worst is making his reads, but he showed signs of improving towards the end of last season. Do I think hes going to win the MVP next year, no way. Do I think hes going to improve with the help of Marshall, of course. And maybe two years down the line he can officially quiet the doubters and prove himself as the franchise QB we have been trying to find for so long."
nyjets,3awkdj,matts77,-11,Wed Jun 24 04:27:20 2015 UTC,"Uhh no, he won't even be in the NFL in 2 years lol"
nyjets,3awkdj,CoywolfExpress,6,Wed Jun 24 14:33:59 2015 UTC,"I think Geno has the potential to be on Joe Flacco's level. They're both large men who have the speed to break out of the pocket for critical first downs. I view a large portion of the problem with Geno as his foot work and pocket presence. Geno is always looking to extend plays by running around, but he tends to make poor decisions rather than taking small losses. He reminds me of Kaep, who has been able to get away with poor footwork on throws by being such a threat in the run game. I think Geno could be a better game manager than Alex Smith if he would stop making throws off his back foot or having the football's nose pointed down on his point of release. It appears to me that poor mechanics affect him more than having a low football IQ. He would succeed best on a team with a run-heavy offense and a dominant Y receiver that could fight for 50-50 balls."
nyjets,3awkdj,TheUnApolegist,5,Wed Jun 24 03:57:41 2015 UTC,"Crazy. I think Flacco too, but i've never seen anything wrong with his mechanics- nothing significant at least. My issues with him on tape have all come from his Football IQ, risky throws on 1st down, poor anticipation of how his movement affects his protection, that kind of stuff. What issues have you seen in the mechanics?"
nyjets,3awkdj,NannigarCire,5,Wed Jun 24 04:24:12 2015 UTC,"I've seen Geno make plenty of throws that were either off his back foot or he has the nose of the football facing down at the point of release, causing the ball to lose velocity and (most likely) affecting his accuracy. He also won't fully step into his throws when the pocket is breaking down around him. They aren't significant parts of his game, but I do see them happen now and again. I felt that I saw at least 5 interceptions this season where Geno made a good decision, but he didn't progress through his motions and made a bad throw leading to an easy pick.   I do agree that Geno needs to learn how his actions affect the O-line's assignments and effectiveness, however, I think having new guards that are at least decent pass blockers will help reduce all of his unnecessary movement."
nyjets,3awkdj,TheUnApolegist,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:50:17 2015 UTC,"I""ve never noticed the nose thing, but i've also never looked for that. Mechanics aren't something i'm highly skilled at, but i remember comparing him side by side with Luck/Rodgers/early Peyton and the only thing i noticed was his feet aren't always pointed at his target, so thanks for the info.  He definitely doesn't reset well when the pressure comes on him, that's a big one. I don't think that's something he'll ever learn though."
nyjets,3awkdj,NannigarCire,3,Wed Jun 24 16:10:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it's Geno trying to run around as much as it's him dropping back and not stopping, lol. Geno doesn't yet understand when to just take the sack. Instead, he tries to extend the play, but backpedals in order to do it. Then, a 5-yard sack turns into a 15-yard sack.  Ultimately, it's recognizing the situation and making decisions accordingly that really hurts Geno."
nyjets,3awkdj,BigNuke43,4,Wed Jun 24 04:04:10 2015 UTC,I find it pain full some times how far he drops back
nyjets,3awkdj,ocyries,2,Wed Jun 24 13:00:04 2015 UTC,"He definitely still tries to outrun linemen like he did in college. I think that's another learning curve that he'll need to get around. The thing is, he's always in a position where he'd prefer to run out of the pocket and try to extend things rather than maintain his composure. It was definitely a boon on our offense, which already suffered from poor play calling."
nyjets,3awkdj,TheUnApolegist,2,Wed Jun 24 04:27:47 2015 UTC,Geno confirmed for elite
nyjets,3awkdj,GraphicNovelty,15,Wed Jun 24 18:04:15 2015 UTC,"I hate on Geno as much as anybody, but I saw him starting to look at more than one receiver after he came back from getting benched.  That's a great sign.  People say it was Harvin, but that's not it.  Geno really did play decently after coming back from his benching.  There's no limit to how good he can be.  He just needs to get his head out of his ass."
nyjets,3awkdj,Shrimpola_Cola,5,Wed Jun 24 03:07:45 2015 UTC,"Geno was looking at multiple receivers before he got benched. That was never an issue last year.

nyjets,3awkdj,FinntheHue,5,Wed Jun 24 04:24:02 2015 UTC,"First year, yes. This year, definitely not. My source on that is from re-watching all the coaches tape. Geno almost always gets to his second read unless his first is open. He'll even reach his 3rd many times early in the season and throughout, when necessary. Fourth is rare, i can only think of one time he did and it resulted in his second worst INT of the year."

nyjets,3awkdj,ocyries,3,Wed Jun 24 12:57:35 2015 UTC,"at the bottom of the screen? yeah, looks like he ran a hitch and just held onto the spot. Think his job here is to occupy his man to keep him low, or be the checkdown if the bears switch from Cover-2 to Cover-3- so don't criticize him too heavily for it."
nyjets,3awkdj,NannigarCire,5,Wed Jun 24 16:12:45 2015 UTC,"I've seen enough to think he lays in that grey zone between starter and career back-up. He's shown enough and has the tools to be entrusted with the QB role just incase... but not consistent enough to depend upon week to week. He's too erratic.   Long term I'm guessing he'll float around the league a bit to different teams before eventually retiring. He'll be one of those guys like Fitzpatrick or Leftwich who are okay and you hold until something better comes along. A level about guys like Cassel and Sanchez, though, but below Shaub.   I do think, though, he'll do better under Gailey. He'll tease us this year but probably not the long long term answer."
nyjets,3awkdj,kuyakew,3,Wed Jun 24 03:19:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's tough to get a read on Geno cause he'll have a game like week 17 vs. the Dolphins but an in game implosion against the Bills too. He definitely can make all the throws and can make something out of nothing by running (big believer in pocket passer's though) so that's very encouraging. Some of those highlight throws last season are just incredible. Geno's mental game is god-knows-where and that my biggest concern. It's frustrating as fuck haha!  My theory is he's a bit softer mentally than his calm demeanor tells us. He would have been best sitting on the bench for a while building enough knowledge of an offense so he wouldn't have to think so much on execution. Situation didn't shake out that way and here we are. I hope to all the Gods, the Lord of Light and Tom Cruise that I'm wrong."
nyjets,3awkdj,kuyakew,4,Wed Jun 24 03:32:24 2015 UTC,"Geno's potential is Joe Flacco. A mobile passer, with a lot of pocket mobility with better deep accuracy than deep velocity. Timing and touch will forever be a little off, but when fine tuned to it's limits, Geno's timing should be above what the NFL asks (he's definitely aware of what the right time is, but regularly hesitates on tape) but his touch is always going to be asking for more. He's naturally a little inaccurate. He'll have the same issue that Flacco has, where his decision making begins to suffer as he gets pressured, that's something that's just not going to be coached out of him- but at his ceiling he'll use the many little flashes of pocket presence to be a much better pocket quarterback. There's a handful of moments in his tape where you can see a legitimate pocket presence budding, so it's within him.  At his most Flacco best, he could also fit the ball into seriously tight windows within the 15 yard range, but is unlikely to ever be able to get tight windows beyond that, or at the sideline. Right now, his timing is too far off to make that an immediate possibility though."
nyjets,3awkdj,NannigarCire,5,Wed Jun 24 03:43:25 2015 UTC,"There are 32 QBs, that means #16 is average (we can call that the andy dalton line). The top 10 is who you would consider good to great, with the top 5 being elite. I would say tannehill is right at that 10 spot. geno's ceiling is somewhere between 16 and 10. We made all the moves, the only suspect unit is the o-line, but its still put up or shut up time. I'm pulling for him to show us some if what we saw at WV"
nyjets,3awkdj,td2910,2,Wed Jun 24 04:18:52 2015 UTC,"After the last game of last season, everything I thought I knew about Geno Smith's ceiling went out the window. He achieved perfection. Do you guys and gals realize how hard it is to throw a 158.3?! He was the only quarterback to throw a 158.3 passer rating in a game.  It happened once all of last season! Once! Of all the NFL games, Geno had the best.  And for that reason alone, he managed to completely put me in a state of disbelief at his future potential."
nyjets,3awkdj,carpy22,2,Wed Jun 24 11:44:43 2015 UTC,I don't think he has the ability to make reads and decisions fast enough to succeed at this level. He can make every throw asked of him and can also be accurate at times. But I just don't think he has a high enough football intelligence that the position now requires to be in the top ten. I will say that in Gailey's system the qb won't have to make many complicated reads and decisions so it is possible that he won't be a detriment.
nyjets,3awkdj,Heywhatcoloristhis,3,Wed Jun 24 20:15:33 2015 UTC,"I on the other hand think he DOES have the ability to go through his reads and make the decisions fast enough. He's got the intelligence. The thing about Geno that grinds my gears is the same thing that Sanchez did. They both get inside their own heads.  If they weren't psyching themselves out, they'd BOTH be above the Dalton line. Geno is a very talented guy, he just doesn't take his time, and seems to throw to the first guy he sees.  When we acquired Harvin, Geno forced the ball to him way too often, and things didn't go well for Geno.   I think that if our OLine (mainly the guards) can protect Geno, we have a great shot at making the playoffs this season.  He's got Gailey who will take a lot of that pressure off of him, and he's got Bmarsh that will teach him what to do when he has that pressure. If Geno can't get it done with this stellar receiving group we have now, he never will."

The biggest difference is ivory accelerates quicker and ridley is more quick footed. Other than that they are basically the same. Stacy has shown some catching ability in the past.

His vision isn't great and that combined with his smallish frame, it makes him more of a 3DB.  I have no idea if he can block or not, but smallish guys tend to struggle in this area.  He had very productive weeks with STL and on some occasions seemed like the leader of the pack during STLs committee approach of the past 2-3 years. He showed pass catching ability in STL and can turn it up field, but I don't know what he offers that Bilal Powell can't.  His health issues have hurt him a bit, especially as a speedy player.  Training camp is where players grab roster spots, but with a plethora of talented RBs on our roster I wouldn't be surprised if he was the odd man out.  However I also wouldn't be surprised if Ridley ended up getting cut with Richardson being a change of pace guy.  That being said, I'm glad we have 4 strong candidates for RB.  Makes me think back to the time when we would trot out Ced Houston and Derrick Blaylock."

nyjets,3aw6f9,UhOhSpaghettios1963,2,Wed Jun 24 00:08:16 2015 UTC,This was my thinking. I just can't see why some people are so high on the Bills when we on paper are superior in every positional group except RB's and possibly D-Line depending on who you ask.(and ours is effing fantastic) Even our O-Line is better and they are our weakest group.
nyjets,3aw6f9,Rjr18,7,Wed Jun 24 00:12:24 2015 UTC,"Because last year the Bills played well enough to go 9-7 and then got a weapon in McCoy that can really change an offense. (Albeit their LB corps took a hit as a result.)   I feel like people have been high on the Bills since, like, 2008 or something. It never pans out, so I'm skeptical about it every time it gets brought up. I will admit they did decently last season and kicked our ass twice, and that there is a possibility that they improve. However, it's not a given."

nyjets,3aw6f9,Dacious96,12,Wed Jun 24 03:08:42 2015 UTC,"First reason is because we finished last in our division last year. Second our QB (Geno) is inconsistent. Third, our new acquisitions, Marshal, Revis, Cro, Skrine, Gilchrist, etc... have yet to play a single down together in a live NFL game. Forth, every other team in our division (except the Pats, but they are the Pats) is seen as improved also. The NFL isn't a vacuum where one team improves and all other stay the same. Just because our schedule looks easier than last year doesn't mean it actually will be.   With all that said, I think we will definitely be better than last year, however I can't say we are going to be super dominant and make the playoffs, I think we are going to be right around 8-8."

nyjets,3aw6f9,CoywolfExpress,-1,Thu Jun 25 06:41:25 2015 UTC,This lol so much this
nyjets,3aw6f9,Dacious96,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:32:11 2015 UTC,"This is a fair assessment, although on the point about not playing a live game together. I would have thought a pundits job was to project how they think they will turn out playing together and extrapolate a stat line from this.  You say the other teams in our division are ""seen"" to have improved, do you think they are actually stronger?"
nyjets,3aw6f9,John_YJKR,3,Wed Jun 24 00:20:51 2015 UTC,"I'll start with the Dolphins. First of all is the obvious, they acquired Suh, whether you believe they over payed him or not is another question but Suh is a dominant player and is going to have a major impact for that team. Him, Wake, and Vernon are good, and if there 2nd round pick Phillips plays well, they could have a D-line that rivals the Bills. Their 1st round pick Parker also has a chance to be very good, he reminds me a lot of AJ Green. I think their receiver core is better this year with the additions of Jennings and Stills and if Tannehill keeps improving being in the 2nd year of that offense, the Dolphins can be very dangerous.  The Bills didn't have as much of a roster turnover as the Dolphins, but they still added some good players. Lesean McCoy is a dangerous runner (although with their o-line and Rex's Ground and Pound offense I don't think he will be that effective), add Percy who is also dangerous with the ball in their hand, and with Watkins in is 2nd year, they have a lot of offensive fire power. Now add in Rex's defensive mastermind to the Buffalo D and they could become an even more dangerous unit then they were before.  Like the Jets however, the only thing holding the Bills back is QB. I think our QB situation is better then theirs, I think Geno is definitely better than EJ and I think Fitz can be better than Cassel, but it really is a toss up between them. I am one of those believers who still thinks Geno could be a quality starter. If we are going to win against these two teams, our o-line is going to need to play their best football cause if you watch those Buffalo games, our o-line got wrecked in those games and we need to give Geno time in the pocket."
nyjets,3aw6f9,Dacious96,0,Wed Jun 24 03:08:01 2015 UTC,Look at the time to throw and time to sack stats. Geno had time. He holds the ball too long.
nyjets,3aw6f9,John_YJKR,2,Wed Jun 24 03:58:11 2015 UTC,"Stats don't tell the whole story, how open were our receiver when he got sacked? If no one is open then no one is open. Decker was injured and I'm sure that effected his ability to get open. After Decker is Kerley and no one else is that big of threat. If no one gets open then there is no where to throw the ball."
nyjets,3aw6f9,Dacious96,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:30:05 2015 UTC,Nope. First off. You throw the ball away in that scenario. Instead he often back pedals and loses yds. The jets were 8th in pass protection.Tape shows he doesn't see open men or misses his time window completely. One of the biggest criticisms of Geno is his inability to go through his progression fast enough or at all in some cases.   I want him to succeed. I want him to be what his physical talent suggests he can be. This new system should go a long way in helping his game. This is his last shot to be our starter of the future.
nyjets,3aw6f9,John_YJKR,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:43:08 2015 UTC,"Where does it say that the Jets were 8th in pass protection? If you go watch the buffalo tape and you will see our line get absolutely abused.   I'm not saying Geno is the best with going through his progression but the talent around him has still be pretty bad. Brick is declining, our guards are bad at pass blocking, Breno is inconsistent, Colon is a penalty machine. Mangold is a rock but still he can't play forever. Our line isn't that great."
nyjets,3aw6f9,Dacious96,3,Wed Jun 24 15:33:03 2015 UTC,"Pro football focus. Football outsiders ranked the line 22 because they rely purely on sacks. But if you look at sacks given up after >3.5 seconds the jets were number one with literally half their allowed sacks coming after >3.5 seconds. Second place wasn't even close. Now. Geno is actually ranked fairly high at avoiding sacks. But when you look at time to initial pressure the jets line still ranked near the top. The line is not amazing but they played above avg. As far as citing the buffalo game, the whole team played awful. And buffalo has one of the top 3 d lines in the league. That's not indicative of a typical game.   You probably think the line is good a run blocking. They were ranked 19th. They were 23rd in penalties. Largely due to colon.   https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2015/01/08/2014-pff-offensive-line-rankings/3/  http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/ol"
nyjets,3aw6f9,John_YJKR,2,Wed Jun 24 16:56:54 2015 UTC,"Listen man I understand your point on Geno holding the ball to long. But you haven't disapproved my point in how open our receivers were on those sack/negative plays where Geno was the one at fault. If a receiver isn't open, he's not open.   Now I know he missed some players who are wide open on some of those negative plays, whether its Geno holding the ball to long or him not going through progressions, but it's not all Geno's fault."
nyjets,3aw6f9,thecakeslayer,0,Wed Jun 24 18:19:01 2015 UTC,Of course it's not completely his fault. But it is mostly on him. Our WR corps wasn't so bad they never got separation. Honestly this is pointless to talk about. I'm betting you'll be one of those upset fans when Geno shows mostly the same stuff we've already seen. Like its shocking. Geno processes the NFL game too slow and he freezes up at times. He has pretty much everything else he needs. Which is great cause he has physical gifts you can't teach. Unfortunately most QB that process the game too slow never adapt and have a ceiling of a career back up. I want Geno to succeed. I really do. But I'm not going good to get my hopes up and be blind to what he's shown us so far. Can't lie to myself like that.
nyjets,3aw6f9,XiiencE,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:52:16 2015 UTC,"I think with all the Dolphins' acquisitions, they will still be average. When Tannehill is money, he's easily a top 10 qb. But he counteracts this by not being money the very next week.  Who shuts down a hot chargers team, then gets steamrolled by Geno Smith? (not to say geno is bad, im actually a geno supporter).   Buffalo wont be getting any better. Rex hasn't been known to develop QBs. And he brought a vast majority of the NYJ staff with him, so it's safe to say the QBs there won't get better, leaving Cassle as the best talent.  Rex and Roman both love to Ground and Pound, and in this division? That's gonna be a very big task for Shady.    The Pats seem to have gotten worse, but they're wizards and will manage to be 2nd in the division at worst."

nyjets,3aw6f9,woodchips24,4,Wed Jun 24 00:35:32 2015 UTC,"It's because we finished worst last season but their are other reasons.   We're  similar to the Bills, their  D line is  slightly better than ours but our D Line is good,our secondary is better but their secondary isn't a joke,uncertainty at the quarterback position,good reciving corps.  People give the Bills the edge again because of records last year and some may think their defense is better.  The Dolphins have the second best quarterback in the division and the best free agent in the NFL,another loaded D Line.   The Patriots just came off a superbowl win I shouldn't have to explain.

But in each of those four game stretches, the Jets were out of playoff contention and had effectively moved into 'next year' mode. The approach to those last four games is different for a 2-10 team than it is for a team fighting for a playoff spot. You make different roster decisions, maybe show some new looks with the play calling, take some chances you didn't earlier in the season. Why not, right? Nothing to lose but another game. Coaches are probably dusting off their resumes anyway.   So why is Geno getting a late surge each year? Figure that out and we've got ourselves a pretty decent QB."

nyjets,3arxgq,chiaestevez,3,Tue Jun 23 13:20:26 2015 UTC,"But you can put stickers on to helmets in order to change their appearance. The Rams have done this the past few years. I mean, aside from the base color, everything on the outside dome of the helmet is a sticker and they typically get reapplied weekly, so it makes sense that you could just put different ones on. This would just be a big sticker."

nyjets,3atx3e,mosherd14,3,Tue Jun 23 15:39:54 2015 UTC,This was actually proven in a study showing the fan bases with the worst grammar. The patriots were in the top five worst and jets were in the top five best.

nyjets,3aqczw,the_furry_stoner,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:29:08 2015 UTC,"which is another whole can of worms   are you an unbiased news site? or are you an opinionated fan with a blog, the likes of manish and cimini who pander to the latest split opinions?  You should go for the unbiased route considering you're trying to be ny jets news.  Also (this is a nitpick): When you call Devin Smith undersized at 6'-0"", 196lbs, it adds a little flourish for your writing, but that size is actually closer to the league means.  I do not understand the purpose of a comment like that except to pretend there's downside to a player only to follow up with something positive in the next sentence.  That might be your writing style, but it leaves a negative connotation for a player you've never seen play in the NFL.  It's also an incorrect statement.    If you're a news site, stick to the facts.  If you're an editorial site, change your name.  edit:  here is some fun data on WR heights:  http://mattwaldmanrsp.com/2014/06/02/wrsizeisitvalidanalysis/"
nyjets,3aqczw,CosmicWy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:08:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips. The site is fairly new and this was the first sports article of any kind I've ever written so still a learning process  edit: However, upon reading your comment more closely I have to disagree with some points. I personally don't think a news site has to be purely news or purely opinion. I think you would be hard pressed to find a news site without an op-ed section or something of the sort. The Jets official site newyorkjets.com has a mix of opinion and news pieces. In addition, Devin Smith is undersized for a receiver and the proof is in the article you linked. Since 2000 theres been a much larger percentage of receivers drafted in the first 2 rounds who are 6' 1"" or taller than 6' or shorter making Devin Smith by definition undersized. As that article points out, that is not necessarily a huge disadvantage. However, thats not the point I was trying to make. I simply said he was undersized because he is shorter than your average receiver not to point out a flaw in his game."

nyjets,3aqs23,downtonil8,2,Tue Jun 23 16:39:23 2015 UTC,"Revis was my favorite player for the Jets. I hated his holdouts but always felt like he was just doing what any rational person would do. When he was traded to the Bucs, I was happy and sad. Sure, we lost Revis but we gained a Sheldon. He came back well from the ACL year and I was hoping he would have a long and successful NFL career.  Then there was the 2014 off-season, one I will always remember. I was hopeful for the Jets. We showed that, with a little luck, our rookie QB and secondary could go 8-8. Knocking at the door of the playoffs. We needed a corner and some offensive help in the off-season. All of a sudden, like a gift from baby Jesus himself, Revis was released by the Bucs. We had cap space. A need. And a reason to bring my all time favorite back. I was pumped. All Idzik needed to do was make the call.   We all know what happened. He signed with the Pats. Ugh, I'm still sick thinking about it. Living in New England didn't help. I heard it all year, and although he was a horrible enemy, I rooted for him. I couldn't root against him. He was the most impressive Jet I've ever seen and I loved watching him, even in that filthy navy blue. But I still rooted for him. I cheered every INT and play that wasn't against us. I just couldn't let go of him. Finally, the Pats won the Super Bowl in probably the best football game I've wittnessed. Both teams gave it their all. I wish they ran it but whatever. I was watching with friends and I can remember my first thoughts after the game were, ""Congrats Darrelle."" I saw my favorite player win a SB. It may not have been with us but he did it and was probably the catalyst for doing so.   This off-season came around and I knew what was coming. Revis was released again. I had hopes but there was a pit in my stomach.  I knew how it went down last year. But I kept faith and continued to believe my favorite player would come home and win another Super Bowl with us. He can do it, I know he can.   Darrelle Revis, I love you. Always have and always will. You're the best I've ever seen and I can't wait to see you bring that Lombardi to the J-E-T-S JETS! JETS!

nyjets,3aqs23,mosherd14,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:03:39 2015 UTC,Nick Folk is king.  He had a hard time in Dallas after great success.  He clawed to make the Jets squad and has been lights out since.

nyjets,3aot35,viewless25,7,Mon Jun 22 11:35:45 2015 UTC,Every time Chrebet gets a mention I say this: if he had played under modern contact rules Wayne would have been an absolute beast. Like first ballot hall of fame level.
nyjets,3aot35,AM_key_bumps,3,Mon Jun 22 12:28:14 2015 UTC,can you explain?
nyjets,3aot35,ZeboTheClown,7,Mon Jun 22 13:16:22 2015 UTC,"If Wayne  had been able to run freely across the middle without fear of his head being forcibly removed from his body his YAC would have increased significantly.  He was known best for getting open on third down, making the catch, getting blown up, and hanging on to the ball.  Now, remove the whole ""getting blown up"" part from the equation and you have Welker, but (IMHO) even better."
nyjets,3aot35,AM_key_bumps,3,Mon Jun 22 14:04:27 2015 UTC,Chrebet in the modern era would be something special to watch.

nyjets,3afw4g,Totally_PJ_Soles,5,Fri Jun 19 21:14:10 2015 UTC,It's exciting to hear that he has improved as a player. It's also exciting to think that he may continue to improve and that his on-field performance may get a boost with the added talent around him that let's him be a more effective player.

nyjets,3afsdj,stvash,8,Fri Jun 19 19:55:31 2015 UTC,We got such a deal on Stacy though. We should try and deal him or I guess take the loss and cut him. I think they keep 4 just due to the talent at the position we have
nyjets,3afsdj,Crcsoccer1,5,Fri Jun 19 21:06:22 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Daryl Richardson. But I think there is going to be four, and I Stacy will be the odd man out. He doesn't bring anything new to the table. He is pretty similar to Ivory and Ridley."
nyjets,3afsdj,kkimball,4,Fri Jun 19 20:08:33 2015 UTC,I think it's a given that Richardson stays on the practice squad but I guess I could be wrong.
nyjets,3afsdj,jamtakno,2,Fri Jun 19 20:09:14 2015 UTC,"I believe we'll end up cutting Stacy, since there's really no place for him. Richardson had some solid minutes in preseason last year, so if he plays well I could see us keeping 4 because of the amount of talent. BUT if he plays average, I'm almost certain we only keep 3 RBs."
nyjets,3afsdj,ThreeCranes,3,Fri Jun 19 20:55:02 2015 UTC,"Powell,Ivory, and Ridley are all free agents next year so it would make sense to keep Stacy for depth purposes since he's like the only running back we have under contract for next year."
nyjets,3afsdj,Rugger11,4,Sat Jun 20 13:57:25 2015 UTC,"I think Ivory, Powell, Ridley, and Stacy. No fullback. Keep in mind Stacy is the only one who will be under contract after this season."

We can find plenty of those in FA, hell Shonn Greene just got cut. Keep Bohanon so we at least have a lead blocker.  Or build a time machine and convince the team to use that 7th to draft Malcolm Brown. I'd love that."

nyjets,3af0cy,SithlordWolfGod,13,Fri Jun 19 16:21:04 2015 UTC,"Marshall is literally living with Geno so hopefully they mesh well. I honestly think that if Geno can't succeed with the weapons he has in Amaro, Decker, Marshall, plus an improved running game then he won't succeed anywhere in the NFL. Back on topic though these guys have great chemistry. On social media a lot of the guys are hanging out with each other and cro and revis are basically best buddies so yeah I think they are all good chemistry wise"
nyjets,3af0cy,Crcsoccer1,6,Fri Jun 19 16:49:51 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree if Geno can't do it now then he needs to find a 9-5 job,   But my question is that do you believe with all of this, and teams like the Eagles and Patriots making significant changes and trades, that if NYJ had ""the best team chemistry and team work"" and Geno doesn't lose the game for us, can we make it to the Super Bowl?"
nyjets,3af0cy,Crcsoccer1,7,Fri Jun 19 17:42:11 2015 UTC,"Yes it's very possible IMO, this is a very good team on both sides of the ball"
nyjets,3af0cy,IAmMrMacgee,3,Fri Jun 19 18:22:21 2015 UTC,"You make a good point, but you make it seem as if The Cavs were supposed to win. They were huge underdogs because they have no one besides James. I'd say you're point would be right if this was the Heat of 3 years ago."
nyjets,3af0cy,aacarbone,2,Fri Jun 19 19:50:37 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't really think of it that way and I didn't realize The Cavs were the underdogs.   What I meant with my analogy was like Tom Brady, and a few other veterans, having to carry their team vs. the Jets with some awesome key players and teamwork and passion to win for the first time in decades and maybe 1 star like Curry (for us it would be Revis or like our D line.)"
nyjets,3af0cy,aacarbone,3,Fri Jun 19 23:06:53 2015 UTC,I think team chemistry is a very overrated attribute to a team. Now obviously if the team hates each other ther'll be problems...but in the end most of these guys are professionals and it really won't affect them if they're friends or just neutral on their teamates  Shaq/Kobe did not have good team chemistry and won 3(?) times
nyjets,3af0cy,iced1776,3,Fri Jun 19 18:20:25 2015 UTC,"Good point so how do you feel about the analogy of Tom Brady kinda being like Lebron, losing a lot of all-star players he might have to carry the team harder in order to succeed in the division giving the jets a better chance at winning."
nyjets,3af0cy,SublimeOwnzzz,4,Fri Jun 19 18:47:53 2015 UTC,"I guess that's kind of comparable although I hate Brady and love Lebron so I hate to compare them lol. But Brady does still have stars around him, not like he's the only one like Lebron was in the finals"
nyjets,3af0cy,CoywolfExpress,3,Fri Jun 19 18:55:13 2015 UTC,"Iron Mike's quote about everyone having a plan until they get punched in the mouth applies pretty well to ""team chemistry"". Getting along in preseason doesn't mean jack, let's see how these guys stick together when things aren't going their way."
nyjets,3af0cy,ocyries,7,Sat Jun 20 03:52:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah man im bored outta my skull, I stopped getting high this week so the days seem twice as long. I've been cycling through reading, playing bass/guitar, and refreshing r/nyjets and r/nfl to see if there's anything interesting. So thanks for posting something haha.  To answer your question I'm beyond pumped for this team. If we can go positive in the division we're going to the playoffs. I think the defense is going to be in sync all year and will dominate games. Forcing turnovers and causing mayhem. By the bye week I think the league will recognize the Jets defense as top 2/3 in the league with Seattle and Buffalo.   Offense is all on Geno. The system is in place, the weapons are definitely there. If he does his job and plays average we're a different team. Other fans obviously don't pay as much attention to the Jets as we do, but I think we all know how close we played almost every team last year. With no fucking secondary... And an injured Decker at WR1 for most of the year. I think Geno living with Marshall is great and they're gonna connect a lot on the field. I'm a big fan of Rex but put all these pieces under Bowles' no nonsense philosophy and this is a dangerous team."
nyjets,3af0cy,Forty-Three,7,Fri Jun 19 17:24:29 2015 UTC,"Dude, I had to cut down my weed smoking as well I am freaking out!  Geno > Sanchez is all I have to say.  And if Sanchez went to the AFC championship twice then Geno can win the fucking Super Bowl.  100% agree please go positive in the god damn division and win the wildcard and get to the playoffs, we will get to the AFC championship or Super Bowl guaranteed."
nyjets,3af0cy,CoywolfExpress,-2,Fri Jun 19 17:38:49 2015 UTC,"As long as Geno is the QB, offensive chemistry will remain low. He is not a leader by any stretch of the imagination, a leader does not act as he does. Curses out fans, accused a flight attendant of racism, deflects blame, undeserved ego, misses meeting, blew a giant hissy fit when he wasn't drafted in the first round, lacks the ability to learn and read NFL defenses, low football iq, inability to make improvements (to which is attributed to his undeserved ego making him believe he is better than he is). I have zero faith in geno smith as a leader and if bowles makes him a captain then this team is truly doomed."
nyjets,3af0cy,Totally_PJ_Soles,5,Fri Jun 19 17:21:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you said about Geno except his football IQ.  I heard his IQ is astounding.  I want to give him the benefit of the doubt that his attitude and ego were due to inexperience and young age (I am like almost as old as he is and if I had to deal with Rex and Idzic and everything i'd probably be a bit edgy and pissed off and frustrated as well).  If Geno got a golden spoon in his mouth and was Andrew Luck or Wilson and got drafted to organizations trying to win the Super Bowl and not trying to save money, then I think Geno would have had a better first 2 seasons.    edit: Changed head to heard"
nyjets,3af0cy,CoywolfExpress,2,Fri Jun 19 17:36:02 2015 UTC,he got a 24 wonderlic Test which is pretty low to the bottom. he tied RG3 and Newton got a 20 and he is doing pretty well
nyjets,3af0cy,jcinema48,2,Fri Jun 19 18:40:30 2015 UTC,"Wonderlic doesn't test football intelligence. Personally I really don't think it shows anything unless the player gets one of the extremes like Fitz or Tavon Austin, who each got a 48 and 7 respectively."
nyjets,3af0cy,CoywolfExpress,-1,Sat Jun 20 00:41:44 2015 UTC,"Eh, I had never seen anyone blow a hissy fit like he did during the draft so I have no faith he was just a product of rex and idzik... he honestly believed he shouldn't bother going to the 2nd day because he believed he was to good for it. When it comes to his football iq I don't believe it's high at all... he has shown a compete and utter lack of ability to read defenses no matter how much tape he watches. He can't seem to absorb core concepts and put them into practice (his footwork hasn't improved in 2 years) not to mention the butt fumble 2.0 against the titans in year 1 where he tried to pass the ball behind his own back in the end zone and then got mad he fumbled it and gave up a touchdown... like wtf did you expect to happen lol"
nyjets,3af0cy,jcinema48,3,Fri Jun 19 17:50:34 2015 UTC,Of course he was mad he didn't go in the first. He isn't the first player to get mad about that. Once we drafted him he was nothing but positive though. He was even fine with sitting behind Sanchez until he got hurt.
nyjets,3af0cy,CoywolfExpress,-2,Fri Jun 19 19:34:30 2015 UTC,"Aaron Rodgers got mad, but he didn't blow a hissy fit about it. It's ok to be angry or upset but it isn't ok to act like a 5 year old who didn't get picked first for red rover. If idzik never picked him in the second, geno would've slipped into the 4th or 5th.. he had no business being drafted in either of the first 2 rounds, his college tape was a complete joke. He still has the same footwork and mechanics as he did a uwv, and he only had what? 5 good games his collegiate career? 75% of his completions and total yardage were screens and yards after catch... I've studied his tape and it still angers me to this day that that dumbass idzik drafted him."

nyjets,3af0cy,darkknight915,3,Fri Jun 19 22:27:26 2015 UTC,"oh wow bro you're going to base these accusations off of some pictures? you actually did a breakdown of Geno's disposition during the draft and came to the conclusion of ""hissy fit""?  give me some actual written evidence. an article, a tweet, a quote, whatever. I'm not going to look at a picture of Geno and make an assumption about how he was feeling in that moment.  If you don't want to do the Google work, well, then, you're ""analysis"" is wrong and you don't have the balls to own up to it"

I think all the AFCE divisional games this year are gonna be amazing.
nyjets,3adp3v,JelliedHam,2,Fri Jun 19 13:04:40 2015 UTC,Oh I was talking about how discouraging it was that Rex would give the Bills a spark and that Bart Scott thinks that these Bills are as good as the '10 Jets. Should've been more clear.
nyjets,3adp3v,John_YJKR,8,Fri Jun 19 20:56:55 2015 UTC,I thought he mostly spoke the truth. Given his history with Rex its not surprising he was so positive about him. We are much better but our division make up changes what's realistic for our record next season. At worst I see 8-8 and at best I see 11-5.
nyjets,3adp3v,whydont,9,Fri Jun 19 07:39:50 2015 UTC,8-8 is not the worst case scenario. We could definitely be a 5 win team next year if things go wrong.

But I think Geno getting too many starts where he doesn't deliver is a disaster too.  That would put the Jets 8-8 on a team that definitely is capable of making the playoffs with a 10-6.

nyjets,3a6awb,anon5848,4,Wed Jun 17 23:21:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with the article to a large extent, and do think he can very well develop into a good quarterback.  Just looking back, his issue is consistency.  It's not like we don't know if he can play at a high level, we've seen plenty of games where he plays like a boss.  The problem is that they're woven with games where he plays terribly, but the fact that he has those great games, often times against great opponents, shows he's got it in him.  Just the main qualm I have with the article was this little sentence: ""In his rookie season, he greatly outperformed expectations with a pretty untalented roster. ""  What were his expectations, and did he ""Greatly outperform"" them?  I don't think so.  We brought him in as a steal on the second round, sure.  He was posed to be a high first rounder if not first overall.  But we came in with the mentality of ""if he fucks up, it's a cheap salary, we didn't waste a first rounder, and he can very well develop to be 'our guy'""  He didn't 'greatly outperform' any expectations.  The expectations were pretty much neutral, but with hope like anyone else does when they see a new QB at the helm.  If anything, we were sure Sanchez was playing better and would have started if not for the injury, we knew he wasn't a stud from the getgo."
nyjets,3a6awb,M3nt0R,5,Thu Jun 18 02:50:43 2015 UTC,Should? Yes. Will? remains to be seen.
nyjets,3a6awb,rvbcaboose1018,2,Thu Jun 18 04:45:01 2015 UTC,"Good read. Geno did show flashes of impressive quarterback play, and if he can keep that consistent to a week to week basis, he might succeed in New York. The new and improved weapons the Jets acquired this offseason will really help Geno out; along with the scary defense that will hopefully take a load off his back. I wouldn't write him off yet."
nyjets,3a6awb,PedoBird,3,Wed Jun 17 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"How many columnists and analysts said the same goddamn thing last year?  This is trash.  The only way Geno is the answer is if he somehow has miraculously cured his alarming propensity to make horrible decisions with the ball on a regular basis. I don't care if it's Rice, Taylor, and Craig out there, Geno will continue to suck unless he makes a full 180 turnaround.  Here's just a short list of his crimes:   Continuously leads receivers with his eyes and body language Forces sloppy throws into coverage  Misses windows and targets by wide margins Gets rattled and skittish by being hit Fails to adequately protect the ball during scrambles at times Fails to recognize blitzes Has difficulty calling audibles Routinely misses wide open or even uncovered receivers because he has tremendous difficulty scanning the entire field   Yeah, unless he's fixed all that we're in for more of the same..."
nyjets,3a6awb,mikerhoa,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:22:13 2015 UTC,"You could be right, but he's still a young QB. Most QB's come into the league with those problems, and maybe it's too late with Geno because of the lack of good QB coaching so far in his career but come on man, it takes time with ANY QB."
nyjets,3a6awb,a_child_to_criticize,-5,Thu Jun 18 05:18:44 2015 UTC,"Geno isn't all that young in football years. In fact, by that metric he's middle aged. He should be showing more than he has by now.  Look, I'm not saying he can't become a good NFL QB, but dammit does he have his work cut out for him. My point is that I'm really not too keen on him holding the Jets back as he goes through yet another round of growing pains. If he was like say a Terry Bradshaw or Steve McNair type that needed time to grow into greatness I truly believe we would have seen flashes of it by now.  We have not. Not even close...  EDIT: Would love to hear how I'm wrong about this one fellas.   The average football career is just over 3 years, so there's that.   Another year of Geno sabotaging wins would what, be a good thing?  And please point out the flashes of greatness for me. Thrashing a Miami team that quit at the end of a lost season doesn't count. So what does that leave? The Falcons Monday Nighter? Okay. A whopping 3 TDs and 199 yds. Wow. Look out Joe Willie, your place as out GOAT is about to be taken!  Every other game is riddled with mediocrity..."

nyjets,3a6awb,mijobu,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:13:23 2015 UTC,"I'll bite.  In Brees's first two full seasons he had more TD's and less INT's, more 300 yd games, higher YPG, and a better rating just to name a few.  Farve had more TD's, more YPG, and a better rating among a bevvy of superior stats in his first two seasons.  I can't even believe you put Marino up there.  Same with Manning. He blows Geno out of the water almost as bad as Marino.  Jim Kelly and Steve Young played in the USFL, so that skews the numbers, but even so:  Kelly has a superior TD/INT, yardage total, rating, YPG, and many others.  Steve Young was a backup for almost all of his career, so you can't really compare the numbers. But suffice it to say that if you tried to make that case to anyone you'd be laughed out of the room.  And Boomer's stat lines in his first two years demolishes Geno's as well in multiple categories including yardage, TD/INT, TD%, Y/A, and so on."

Shit, I'd accept Roethlisberger's.  And did you watch any games last year? He couldn't produce with Decker, Amaro, Kerley, and Harvin. You really gonna say it was only Gates and Salas out there?"
nyjets,3a6awb,CosmicWy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:32:01 2015 UTC,"not this again?  You just compared arguably the least productive QB in the league to two hall of famers?   Geno's numbers have been dissected and he was much better with harvin on the team.  Also, maybe you forgot Decker had his nagging hamstring injury and Amaro was a rookie (and he was meh).   Geno isn't great. He's barely been good! But do not pretend we've ever given him weapons.   Let's also remember that even though he was pretty bad last year, the addition of Decker and 1/2 season of harvin resulted in an 11 point increase in his QB rating, a rise from 55.8 to 59.7% in completion percentage, and a decrease in his TD:INT ratio.   Geno has not been good, but a 2nd+ round QB who started immediately is never going to be immediately productive (russell wilson aside).   AND do not compare him to Tom Brady or Ben Roethlisberger.  It doesn't make any sense and makes for a disingenuous argument."

And as for the mediocre stat salad you posted, look at his game log and tell me there's a good QB in there, please, I need a good laugh this morning.  Some of you guys will pull any argument out of your ass.   Geno has not been good   That's all we need to know after two full seasons. And not only that, he has not even come close."
nyjets,3a6awb,giobbistar21,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:48:00 2015 UTC,"I am not suggesting that the Jets put their franchise on Geno's back for the remainder of his career.  I am talking about 2015.  Geno's stats from last year are now on par with Ryan Fitzpatrick's 10 year career averages.   My optimism is that Geno can improve over Fitzpatrick (because Gen's sample size is much smaller than Fitz).  If Geno does not improve, then he's gone.   Re: Smith and Tanny. We do not have those other guys on our roster, so have a great time comparing Geno to people who can literally not replace him on his roster.  That is completely unproductive.  What is productive?  Go look at Alex Smith's and Ryan Tannahill's first two seasons. You will actually see that they were bottom 10% QB's in the league.  Alex smith was terrible for 4-5 seasons and Tanny was not much better than Geno has been. Their improvement bodes better for Geno than you saying ""These guys are better now!""   Geno has had good games with bad teams.   Now it's time to see if Geno can string together some good games with good teams.  I really cannot understand why people cannot think someone with obvious talent cannot improve?  Complete lack of faith in their fellow humans."
nyjets,3a6awb,Thehulk666,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:19:46 2015 UTC,"We're actually not that far apart, and we both want the same thing.  I was using Smith and Tanny to illustrate the fact that QB's were doing better than Geno without high octane star driven passing attacks in the 2014 season. TBH I wouldn't be thrilled to have them on the Jets either, but they're better than Geno.  For argument's sake, Smith and Tanny played on some putrid teams behind unbelievably bad O-lines early on. Geno has had much more to work with and has actually done less in some areas.   Smith's injuries skew the numbers, but he still managed more TD's, a better QBR, better TD/INT, better YPG, and a better Rate + in 11 games in 2009 (his second full season) compared to Geno's regressive second season. That means he was improving, while Geno is not.   And Tanny's numbers are better than Geno's almost across the entire board, so it's not even worth dissecting them.  If Geno starts, nobody will be rooting harder for him than me. But every sign points to him not being the guy, and that's very frustrating...."
nyjets,3a5snu,Itsascrnnam,4,Wed Jun 17 13:27:17 2015 UTC,"Wesley has to be one of the most underrated Jets of all time. Rarely put up glamorous numbers but had pretty incredible longevity. I would kill to have him and Toon both going for 1,000 yards like they did in '86. Here's hoping Decker and Marshall can match that combination."
nyjets,3a65xa,blinkme123,39,Wed Jun 17 15:15:33 2015 UTC,"With every passing today I am becoming more and more comfortable with the decision to let Rex go. With him as the coach I had the most fun I've ever had as a Jets fan and I wouldn't trade that ride for anything (except a Super Bowl), but loyalty is both his greatest strength and greatest weakness. It shows his players that he believes in them and they play hard for him as a result, but it also keeps mediocre players around far past their expiration date. I wish Rex the best and will root for him, because I don't think there's anyone that wants a SB ring more than that man, but it's hard to believe he'll get one if he doesn't learn from his mistakes."
nyjets,3a65xa,chickenKsadilla,10,Wed Jun 17 16:32:48 2015 UTC,I'm glad he is gone. I really got tired of him running his mouth

nyjets,3a65xa,chickenKsadilla,7,Wed Jun 17 18:44:01 2015 UTC,"Also, making Santonio Holmes a captain was questionable(in his defense, he is a Super Bowl MVP), but Sanchez? Even the fans could tell that was a ploy to get people to respect his game more. Nothing was more infuriating than hearing his ""We gotta get better press conferences"" after 3 INT games because he knew Rex was going to fall on the sword for everyone.  Then when he had a chance to admit he was wrong, what does he do? Takes the captain position away. Have fun Buffalo."
nyjets,3a65xa,finalrest,2,Wed Jun 17 18:41:31 2015 UTC,"Right now, Sanchez has had a better career than Geno Smith."

Buffalo had a shaky offensive line this year, and I'm guessing they're letting Wayne Hunter be a camp body.  It would only be nuts to take a look at Wayne if there were UDFA OTs/OGs out there that are better.  My guess is that there isn't (available to Buffalo).   You have to have a backup when the starting OT goes down, that's the nature of the game."

To find a silver lining, Wayne Hunter filled in admirably for part of a single season.  After that, he was very effective as a blocking TE on formations with 4 linemen off on one side (the formation name is escaping me).  He did suck really hard as a starting tackle and I'm glad he was traded."

nyjets,3a465e,CoywolfExpress,-4,Wed Jun 17 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"If he keeps this level of play He'll be demanding a minimum of 100mil. No way in hell we pay that, look at the contracts we have now, no way that money can be swung and keep a viable offense together. Not to mention the fact that he is on record as saying he cares only about getting paid. He doesn't care about the team unless it helps him earn more money."
nyjets,3a465e,jt265,2,Wed Jun 17 19:40:23 2015 UTC,So...based on nothing. Got it.
nyjets,3a465e,CoywolfExpress,-3,Wed Jun 17 19:43:21 2015 UTC,"You're just naive, he doesn't care about the team and we'd be stupid not to trade him (if we resign wilk that is) do you know what kind of compensation you can get for a player like him? We can move him next year and move up in the draft to snag hackenberg without mortgaging our future. If you think having 5 overpaid defenders is more important than getting a strong QB and keeping a viable offense on the field that you sir are a moron"
nyjets,3a465e,jt265,2,Wed Jun 17 19:57:04 2015 UTC,"And you're making judgments about my opinions (which I never stated) and Mac's negotiating (of which he's shown an obvious willingness to spend money) based on absolutely nothing.   First, he's under contract through 2016. In 2017, the Jets can get out of most of the contracts of Cro, Skrine, and Gilchrist if they need the money. They also can franchise Richardson for another year or two if they want to clear all the dead money from those contracts. They could even clear Revis in 3 years if need be.  Second, there are no rumors about him getting moved. And not only that, you're already giving up a cornerstone defensive player for Hackenberg, a guy who has shown no indication that he's worth it. Yes, QB is an obvious need, and I'll make my judgements as situations arise, but to say, right now, that ""next year they're obviously trading Richardson for a QB"" is pretty ignorant."
nyjets,3a465e,CoywolfExpress,-2,Wed Jun 17 20:12:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't say they will do it next year, but they will most likely do it before his contract is up. And he is going to walk anyway so we might as well get something for it. The guy is a mercenary"

Opposing defenses are going to regret not focusing on Kerley because he can BALL against mediocre CBs. While he gets absolutely smothered against CB1s, he fits right below a good CB2 in terms of talent, and can absolutely wreck a slot corner. Watch him next year."

nyjets,39xh2x,Vaedur,12,Mon Jun 15 16:27:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The test with Percy last year showed that Geno performs better with more talent around him. Geno is going into his third year now and if he isn’t the starter or gets pulled, that spells the end of his time here in green. There is no more time to sit and wait for him to develop so there is no sense to just give the job to Fitz to have Geno sit and learn. Don’t get me wrong, if Fitz goes out there and takes the starting gig away from Geno because he is performing much better, then so be it. We know what we have with Fitz and he is a guy who won’t lose us games but at the same time will not win us any either. Geno has the potential to be that guy who can win us games. Will he reach that potential? Jury is still out but this is the season to prove it. This is Geno’s gig to lose. I want the best qb out there but we shouldn’t be handing the job away to anyone right yet."
nyjets,39xh2x,Rugger11,6,Mon Jun 15 18:25:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  I feel that Geno has so much potential and with the talent he has now he should be able to do well.  If can't perform well throwing to Marshall, Decker, Kerley, Smith, and Amaro then he simply isn't going to make IMHO. I am happy though that we have such an early bye because if he doesn't work out then we will have time to bring Fitzpatrick up to speed to take that starting job.  Fitzpatrick to me is the guy like you said won't lose the game for us.  At this point I would be very happy with a QB that is good enough just to protect the ball amd manage the clock and keep us in the game to allow our run game and defense win it for us."
nyjets,39xh2x,rfnk,3,Mon Jun 15 20:50:30 2015 UTC,Geno performs better with more talent around him.   Isn't this true of all QBs?
nyjets,39xh2x,mrnotoriousman,9,Tue Jun 16 15:38:06 2015 UTC,"Good article, but I think what you're missing is if Fitzpatrick wins the competition and starts, that's fine. However, if Geno starts we have to give him the chance to succeed. Fitz was brought in to be the typical back up who won't win or lose games for your team, and I think he can be just that. However if Geno doesn't get a legitimate chance to succeed this year, then goes somewhere else and succeeds we'll all be banging our heads against the wall for letting him get away without some sort of real competition or letting him try.   I'm not saying we should hold onto him for years because there is a chance he might be good, I say give him his last chance now. If we don't see a noticeable improvement consistently through out his starts, they should bench him for Fitz and either trade him or ride out the contract. In this case Fitz would help groom Petty or whatever young QB we acquire there after"
nyjets,39xh2x,jrg114,3,Mon Jun 15 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"Hey, so I wrote this article. I'm assuming that Fitz will win the competition or at least be more consistent, and my point is that I think this team will be better with a consistent ""B"" game from Fitz (which I think he is capable of with this team) than a few A games but a lot of C and D games which is what we've seen from Geno so far. If Geno shows greater consistency and wins the job in camp, that's great, but based off of what we know right now my opinion is it needs to be Fitz. But there's plenty of time for me to be proven wrong"
nyjets,39xh2x,bindelnuts24,3,Tue Jun 16 03:07:12 2015 UTC,"Fitz was brought in to be the typical back up who won't win or lose games for your team,   No, Fitz is not a ""typical"" backup QB, because most of them stink.  Fitz is a veteran, potentially capable starter.  Because of his history, the Jets have every reason to believe Fitz can function as a mid-90's QB rating QB.  That's a player that can take ensure your passing offense can function, will not throw away games, and take the team to the playoffs.   Its Buffalo's Kyle Orton plan on steroids.  I don't want to hear shit about giving Geno Smith a chance, if neither Bowles or Gailey feel confident making Geno the starter.  That's the key factor here.  Right now, if Fitz starts, the Jets have a solid chance of making the playoffs.  That's at least a 10 wins.  What happens if Geno starts, and is 2-2 at the bye?  What if Geno makes wonderful passes, seems to perform at a 90+ QB rating, but still has inexplicably inconsistent play, which has been his history!  The Jets could end up 8-8, when they should be 10-6.  And we'll still have this stupid debate over whether Geno has improved enough to believe he can be a solid, starting QB."
nyjets,39xh2x,sameolejets,6,Tue Jun 16 00:08:40 2015 UTC,"MID NINITIES?!?!  He just finished a partial season at 95 QBrating.  That was the highest of his career by a wide margin.  he is a career 79 qb rating.  we all, as a group, need to recognize the outlier that was Fitzpatrick's last season.  If he is starting on the Jets, He can most likely live in the 75-85 qb rating range, completing 57-60% of his passes and probably posting an extrapolated 3:2 TD:INT, with about 3000 yards.  That's not bad, but that's probably what we're going to get with Geno.  Fitz is exactly what everyone thinks he is.  A failed starter in buffalo who became a career backup who do to circumstances became a starter over and over.  He fills in admirably.  If he is really capable of posting 95 QB ratings, Tennessee wouldn't have let him walk and the texans wouldn't have replaced him with Ryan Mallet or new backup Hoyer ""the Destroyer.""  Let me also say, I LOVE THE FITZPATRICK signing and I love it just like I love the petty draft pick.  We have (albeit lacking in talent) depth at our weakest position.  really,we need to wait for the real competition in camp.  Let the best QB start. However, tie goes to Geno.  Then we evaluate him game by game and hope we can see something substantial by week 5 bye."
nyjets,39xh2x,CosmicWy,2,Tue Jun 16 03:14:58 2015 UTC,"if neither Bowles or Gailey feel confident making Geno the starter.    Go ahead and read over my comment again, I said if he doesn't win the competition I'm fine with starting Fitz.   if Fitz starts, the Jets have a solid chance of making the playoffs. That's at least a 10 wins.   This team has never played in pads together, all of a sudden they can get 10 wins, You guys are fucking ridiculous with the hype you're buying into.  You're first paragraph is completely wrong, Kyle Orton played like a god sent for Buffalo last year and we'd be very lucky if any QB on this team could match him from last year. Like I said he won't win or lose games which is why, IF Geno does not perform well, he gets the bench.  Jet fans are far too reactionary, and it's a huge reason why we've never experienced continued success. This what if shit is annoying me, we can only go off what we know right now. Right now, Geno still has a lot of potential and many years ahead of him, and Fitz has a finite amount of time left in the league. If they're even close you would be an idiot not to go with the one who has more longevity and much bigger potential."
nyjets,39xh2x,jrg114,7,Tue Jun 16 00:41:03 2015 UTC,"How come no other fans are looking at Fitzpatrick's career stats?  They see last years stats which are crazy inflated due to the titans beating he delivered.  Fitz is a plug, if we find outselves with a hole in the bucket."

nyjets,39m4n4,Shadune,-3,Fri Jun 12 23:02:23 2015 UTC,This is all fine and adorable until Geno has twice as many interceptions as touchdowns at the bye week and Marshall is frustrated at lack of targets.  I can't wait for the year when we have a stable quarterback and every season doesn't have to be hopeless right from the start because the most important position on the field is manned by a incompetent dipshit
nyjets,39m4n4,banana455,5,Sat Jun 13 17:15:31 2015 UTC,"And this is why we can't have nice things, because people like you look at the Andrew Lucks of this world and think ""Every rookie quarterback should be Andrew Friggin Luck, and those who aren't are total busts."" How about instead of automatically assume Geno is going to fuck up, at least give him some benefit of the doubt? First of all, let's see how he adjusts to an offense that HE ACTUALLY PLAYED WITH IN COLLEGE instead of this West coast crap that Mornhinweg shoved up his ass. And furthermore, how about realizing that some of the pressure should be off Geno now because the defense went from ""scary up front, dogshit in the back"" to ""Holy mother of fuck, that whole unit is scary.""? If the defense plays up to its caliber and Geno plays to at least Tannehill or Dalton's level, then boom, we have a shot. Seriously though, you anti-Geno idiots are why people don't take Jets fans seriously."
nyjets,39m4n4,giobbistar21,-1,Sun Jun 14 03:02:53 2015 UTC,Lol fans who correctly identify a shitty quarterback as a shitty quarterback are most definitely not the reason people don't take jets fans seriously. Idiot homers like you who reject reality are a more likely cause
nyjets,39m4n4,banana455,3,Sun Jun 14 05:42:08 2015 UTC,"I am the furthest thing from a homer. I at least understand that Geno was terrible in that offense, but instead of automatically deducing that he was crap without understanding why he was crap, I figured out why. A west coast offense, while better than the run-based Sparano offense from 2012, is so restrictive that it completely goes against what a spread offense quarterback learns. In a spread system, a quarterback has more freedom and isn't forced to make predetermined throws. Furthermore, you have to consider that the whole season wasn't Geno's fault. First of all, while he didn't make a massive second year leap, he did at least slightly improve. Seriously, look at his stats.   The reason why those who are against Geno can't see that is because they keep referring to his worst games, like Buffalo or San Diego and they laser focus on those games. Yes, when Geno was bad, he was bad, but again, he did have good games too. He's been able to keep it close against our most hated rival, for example, and he's been good against Miami on the road.   Geno isn't the only problem from last year. As I pointed out (and you conveniently ignored this), the secondary was absolute shit. They had the fewest interceptions, allowed the third most touchdowns, and opposing quarterbacks had the third highest passer rating against them. You could look at the Jets-Vikings or Jets-Packers games as an example of this, well-fought games which unfortunately fell the other way because the secondary couldn't cover Jairus Wright and Jordy Nelson.   So yes, I acknowledge at least that Geno was terrible last year, but unlike you, I realize that maybe there was more to this than him. Let Chan Gailey do his job and see if he can get him back in his comfort zone with the spread. Stop thinking that Ryan Fitzpatrick is going to be the answer this year because he clearly isn't unless Geno completely fucks up. And don't you ever call me a homer."
nyjets,39m4n4,giobbistar21,0,Sun Jun 14 12:42:44 2015 UTC,"I ignored your comment about the secondary because it was completely irrelevant. We are talking about the quarterback. If you truly believe fixing Geno is as simple as changing systems then you are even more delusional than I thought. He has flaws that transcend any system. He is inaccurate, incapable of reading defenses, indecisive and uncomfortable in the pocket and under pressure and does not even comprehend the concept of time zones. His only redeeming characteristics are that he has a pretty strong arm and is useful running the ball. Other than that, he sucks balls and I find it hilarious that we are allowing a second round pick a third year to shit the bed, though I suppose the options this offseason weren't the best.   I'm sincerely sorry you are so outraged at me calling you a homer. Ill remember not to insult you from now on when you are on your period."
nyjets,39m4n4,banana455,3,Sun Jun 14 16:10:33 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm not going to try to convince anyone here that Geno is good, however, I think it's completely unfair to call him a failed project after three years. I do feel that it is important to point out that the Jets sucked last year because the issues were not only at quarterback but also in several other areas. The offensive line had a down year, Eric Decker was a #2 receiver in a #1 role and there was nobody behind him I mean for Christ's sake, before Percy Harvin came in, David Nelson was the #2. David Nelson a street free agent who was cut by Buffalo, the epitome of bad offense, the secondary was awful, and yes, Geno had maturity and performance issues which were magnified in certain games. I am also not saying that Chan Gailey's spread system is going to instantly fix him, look at Alex Smith, he had to wait 7 years before things started to click. But still, a quarterback that is allowed to play in a system tailored to his own strengths is going to have a better time that a quarterback pigeonholed into a system that is completely foreign and discourages what he knows. Why do you think Blaine Gabbert completely bombed in Jacksonville? Why did Andy Dalton regress this year after Jay Gruden left for the Redskins? And furthermore, why did Ryan Fitzpatrick earn a 5 year contract extension when Chan Gailey was HC in Buffalo? I'm sure you've heard this argument several times, but not every quarterback is expected to step in the first year and play like a pro-bowler. I think before the judgement is made, we should at least see what he can do in the spread. I think we should see if he actually learns a thing or two from Brandon Marshall, and I think we should see if Todd Bowles' leadership is able to teach him a thing or two about accountability.   Also, about that period comment, blow me."
nyjets,39m4n4,giobbistar21,2,Sun Jun 14 16:59:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna argue that there were other critical problems with the team, that is obviously true. But its still not the point, its possible to evaluate him independent of other factors. You say he now has a system built to his strengths. What exactly are Geno's ""strengths""? I explained how he has major flaws with basically every fundamental aspect of quarterbacking, I fail to see how moving to a more different system will change any of that. The defense I hear of him from other fans are remarkably similar to the shit we heard people defending Sanchez with for years, and we all know how that ended."

Edit: to clarify on the 'ifs' of our current players  (D-Line specifically), it's basically the best possible if situation we could have. IF Richardson or Snacks gets even better, we could afford to lose someone like Wilk. IF Williams is a beast it's still the same situation. IF Mo plays like a monster we can find a way to give him that contract. Regardless in no situation should we be throwing a ton of money into our lineman if we wind up having to rotate them just to get all of them playing time."
nyjets,39lb47,Deigs,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:39:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that it's the best possible situation.  I love having players playing for a contract in that it tends to bring out the best in them.  He wants to be paid like the best, then he needs to go out and show it.  I've been saying that he's crazy for not compromising and getting a contract done.  It's a violent league where your career could come to an end at anytime, why risk that? Wilkerson missed 3 games last year. In a lost year, no big deal but if it happens again?  Then he would be looked at as injury prone, bringing down his price.  So go out, play in beast mode for 16 games and register double digit sacks= 15 million a year.  Anything else, like last year's 13 game 6 sack effort= 10 to 12 depending on how effective he is in other facets of the game.  God forbid he gets injured for any extended period of time and all bets are off.  5 years 60 million with first 2 years and 33 million guaranteed,  he's crazy if he doesn't take that and risks playing out the year."
nyjets,39lb47,ynksjts,2,Mon Jun 15 09:20:48 2015 UTC,"It didn't. Thats what we really should be paying Mo. $10m a year is spot on.  The Robert Quinn deal did, though. Rams signed him to a four-year, $66.575m extension with 41m in guarantees. That's $16.5m a year if he gets paid in full. Mo is at about the same level as Quinn-they both lead the conversation for best DE not named JJ Watt. That contract could spell trouble."
nyjets,39lb47,otomotopia,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:45:00 2015 UTC,"Quinn's deal is probably going to kill any chance of us re-signing Mo. As good as Wilkerson is, he's not the same value as Quinn since he's not a premier edge rusher but the agent he works for is unlikely to try to sell him as anything less. If we do get Mo under contract, it'd be one of the most amazing displays of GM-ing i could imagine."
nyjets,39lb47,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:37:05 2015 UTC,"I think Quinn got that deal after leading the league 2 years ago with 19 sacks, so they paid him after a career year."

nyjets,39hodf,beckett360,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:44:34 2015 UTC,"If we want to sign Mo, Mathis is more than likely a no go."
nyjets,39hodf,Shesaidshewaslvl18,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:48:45 2015 UTC,"We have a little over 5 million in cap space, if we cut Cumberland that would free up another million.  We are in good shape with many vets playing on contracts with very little dead money.  We will be able to sign Mo if we want to.  We could sign Mathis also.  For next year the cap will go up around 8 million.  Figure Petty steps in for Fitz, that will free up another 3.  Cro,Gilchrist,Marshall,Breno all would free up a lot of money if cut.  If they play well, great,we keep them.  If any of them don't, it's extra cap space."
nyjets,39hodf,ynksjts,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:51:53 2015 UTC,Petty stepping in for Fitz won't free up any money in 2016 as Fitz is on a one year deal anyways.   Another way to free up some money is to rework Coples' contract. He isn't worth a nearly $8 million cap hit. Signing Mathis also makes Carpenter very cuttable which frees up just under $3 million
nyjets,39hodf,Wayyyy_Too_Soon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:59:01 2015 UTC,"Your right, but his 3.25 comes off our books freeing up that money.  In other words, we'd be spending over 3 million less at the qb position."

nyjets,39hodf,anon5848,3,Thu Jun 11 21:58:02 2015 UTC,"I think we can definitely afford him, that's not the issue.   It might piss of Wilkerson, but, in all honesty, who cares? He's going to get paid, in the form of a either the franchise tag next season and then a multi-year deal from the Jets (hopefully) or another team, or just in a multi-year deal when his rookie deal is actually up."
nyjets,39hodf,ynksjts,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:23:09 2015 UTC,Wilkerson is getting bad advice if he doesn't compromise and sign a fair contract.  His career could end tomorrow and then he'd be out millions.  5 years 60 million with first 2 years and 33 million guaranteed sounds right.

nyjets,39hodf,otomotopia,0,Fri Jun 12 13:59:03 2015 UTC,"Whelp. Time to clear some cap room.  Colon and Winters are $1.5m combined. Or we get rid of Carpender for $2,375,000. That leaves us with 7 and 7.7 million this year to pay him.  Takes us out of the Wilkerson running though."
nyjets,39hodf,John_YJKR,11,Thu Jun 11 20:34:30 2015 UTC,Carpenter isn't going anywhere. I wouldn't mind cutting colon and Winters. And how does this affect mo? An extension is future money and doesn't affect the cap this season.
nyjets,39hodf,otomotopia,2,Thu Jun 11 20:48:03 2015 UTC,Next season's cap is huge. We're barely losing any cap space with vets being phased out. We won't have the 10m to pay Mo if we pay Mathis his $6-7m.
nyjets,39hodf,John_YJKR,2,Thu Jun 11 20:56:20 2015 UTC,We can back load it. It's really not an issue. Mathis is a left guard so he's not really a fit anyway. We gave plenty of competition for the right guard spot. It'll be fine. We can draft oline next season.
nyjets,39hodf,FairEnough,2,Thu Jun 11 21:11:25 2015 UTC,"Who says Mathis gets that much? He was getting $5.5m with the Eagles. Given that most team have their rosters more or less and have limited cap room left, do you really think there's that much of a market for him that he gets a raise?"
nyjets,39hodf,otomotopia,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:25:11 2015 UTC,"He was a top 3 guard last year, so yes. It's crazy, he's been getting better with age with two pro bowl mentions, 2013-14. The top paid LGs are getting 7-8.5m, Mathis was making nearly a million less than Zane Beadles alone. He's worth $6m."
nyjets,39hodf,FairEnough,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:32:29 2015 UTC,All I meant to say was what he's worth vs what the market is willing to pay him (given the current situation) could be very different numbers.
nyjets,39hodf,dagcity,3,Thu Jun 11 21:49:24 2015 UTC,"Mathis just got released from a $5.5 mill contract. Don't think he'll get that on the market as I'm sure the Eagles were looking for trade partners and couldn't get anyone to take on his contract.   But then again, he may be able to get a bidding war between a couple teams and raise his value that way.  I say cut Colon & maybe even Winters and see if Mathis will bite on a short term (1-2 yr) deal for around $3.5-4 mill a year."

And those yesterday who said ""it's just mini camp let's wait until real action"" will probably still say, ""it's just mini camp.  Let's wait until real action.""  And that's the correct course of action.  It's still camp/practice and should still be followed just to see what's going on and who's clicking with who and what not, but let's not pass judgement until real gametime situation.  Even if it's preseason, at least that's worth something more than a mini camp.  Let's just not stir shit up and let our QB learn and build chemistry in a new system with new teammates and a new defense."
nyjets,39bwqy,M3nt0R,8,Wed Jun 10 18:58:09 2015 UTC,"I think you could use ""Of course, what did you expect from Geno?"" with both these situations and be correct."

It's a minicamp practice, so it really doesn't matter, but yesterday's turnover-filled performance is standard for Geno to this point."
nyjets,39bwqy,BigNuke43,11,Wed Jun 10 23:22:03 2015 UTC,"Do you have any idea how these drills work? You have no choice but to throw the ball to the intended target. You can't scramble you can't check down, you must throw to the target. The reporters of course don't mention that fact because once the decision making process is removed from the INT it's no longer clickbait.   If you want to see how he doing, you need to look at 11 on 11s, not drills where the D knows what you are trying to do on every throw. I'm not a Geno fan at all, but people need to get more informed on how camp drills work."

nyjets,39bbgg,Futilemediocrity,2,Wed Jun 10 16:47:47 2015 UTC,"I don't want to read into this too much cause it's Manish and he's straight trash, but Sheldon sounds like a mercenary who won't be around when his rookie contract ends unless he gets a grossly overpaid extension.  Especially him feeling this way:  “There’ll never be another Ray Lewis sticking with the same team their whole career,” Richardson said. “Peyton Manning’s on a different team . . . and that’s Peyton Manning. You build your relationships with (teammates), but no matter how strong they get, in the end, you got to realize that they might not be here the next day.”"
nyjets,39bbgg,achokshi,7,Wed Jun 10 20:49:19 2015 UTC,"I mean, he isn't wrong. For a player to stick with one franchise until they retire is a really rare thing. In fact, the only Jet I can think of who was with the team for his whole career in the time when I've been a fan would be Wayne Chrebet. Curtis Martin was drafted a Patriot, Pennington retired a Dolphin, Ellis retired a Patriot (ugh), Mawae retired a Titan, etc. etc. At the moment, the only player I can see realistically retiring in green and white is Nick Mangold, but even then he has a massive contract that will likely need to be reworked in the near future.  Just because Sheldon is acknowledging this doesn't make him a mercenary. He just understands that this is a business and you can't get too attached to the team. I'd be surprised if you can find a single guy in the NFL who doesn't have that attitude."

The most famous quote in the history of the Super Bowl didn’t come on Media Day. It didn’t come during one of the six (and sometimes as many as eight) media sessions that the NFL regularly builds into Super Bowl week that don’t involve people wearing barrels around their midsection and credentials around their neck. It came during the Miami Touchdown Dinner held on Jan. 9, 1969, three days before Super Bowl III. Joe Namath was on the dais, accepting the award for the club’s Player of the Year. Famously, a heckler from the audience with either emotional or fiscal ties to the Baltimore Colts shouted out: “Hey, Namath! We’re gonna kick your [arse]!” And even more famously, after telling the heckler — and believe me, it’s burned three generations of sportswriters that it was a HECKLER and not a SPORTSWRITER who asked the question that drew the most famous quote in Super Bowl history — that he was tired of hearing that blankety-blank all week, Namath gave us this beauty, which should forevermore be printed in red ink:  “I got news for you: We’re gonna win the game. I guarantee it.”   EDIT: Source- http://nypost.com/2015/01/27/a-heckler-worked-on-namath-maybe-one-was-needed-to-get-marshawn-to-talk/"

nyjets,396k1m,A166524,13,Wed Jun 10 00:29:00 2015 UTC,Jpp isn't on the same level as Mo. Cameron Jordan was drafted the same year as Mo and already got paid out. He's seeing revis and Cromartie getting paid out and just wants his share of the pie. Blame the media for over blowing the OTA absences.
nyjets,396k1m,tps222,2,Tue Jun 9 17:04:36 2015 UTC,"Look I'm not going to throw around a ton of stats or PFF grades, but if you don't know the beast JPP is then I don't know what to tell you.    He had a down 2013 because of his back, but came back in 14 to get   12.5 sacks vs Mo's 5.5  77 Comb tackles vs 55  Considering he gets doubled every play, that's phenomenal."
nyjets,396k1m,editnonameedit,11,Tue Jun 9 17:35:40 2015 UTC,"You are not throwing around PFF grades because Mo grades out a lot higher than JPP.  JPP also plays DE in a 4-3, where his job the majority of the time is to go get the QB. That is so different than what we have Mo do it is not even funny. We line Mo up everywhere and he gets doubled consistently.   He had 10.5 sacks in 2013. There is not a doubt in my mind that if you put Mo in JPP's position he would meet or exceed his numbers."

Well there is not a doubt in my mind that (i) we all want to see Brady get sacked; and (ii) we all like tacos. Because tacos are awesome.   So let's just focus on getting some of those tacos and hope that Mac Daddy keeps Mo around long enough to give us plenty more Brady sacks.   Sound good?
nyjets,396k1m,BootRecognition,-1,Wed Jun 10 00:22:43 2015 UTC,"I know the PFF grades, but that wasn't my point.  Here they are if anyone cares. 4-3 ................ 3-4  And, they are different athletes with different skill sets so I don't see the logic in predicting results from plugging Mo into JPP's role and vice versa.    I'd love to see Mo do  this.    I was simply making the point he played out his last year of his contract without holding out or all the drama that seems to be going on with Mo.  Is that really debatable?"
nyjets,396k1m,editnonameedit,0,Wed Jun 10 03:11:39 2015 UTC,"And, they are different athletes with different skill sets   Yes they are and Mo is much more versatile. As I said if you put Wilkerson in JPP's role there is no doubt in my mind he gets just as many sacks. He already had a 11 sack season and he has only gotten better since then. If you tried to have JPP do what Wilkerson does I think he is going to struggle.   I'd love to see Mo do this   When lineman start back fliping on to QB's is when I will give a shit about things like that."

So JPP was just playing out his contract.   Lots of players do these holdouts/showing public displeasure because its the only way to show the organization you are unhappy with your deal.  And lots of players do this now, Vernon Davis and Alex Boone did it last year for the 49ers, DT is currently doing this to the Broncos, and Revis did this to us back in like 2010, and that was 10x worse than what Mo has been doing.   If you don't remember anyone else ""crying and bitching like Mo"" it's either you don't pay attention to other teams around the league or you're new to closely following contract negotiations to not remember Revis's holdout. Either way Mo has been pretty good about it for just skipping voluntary workouts."

If he balls out, perfect! The new regime can continue to develop him. If he blows chunks, well, time to start over and find a new QB, probably with better positioned draft picks than with Fitz starting.  Unless you think Fitz can take the Jets to the promised land this season or next, what's the point of making him the undisputed starter?"

nyjets,397gxd,John_YJKR,0,Wed Jun 10 04:04:18 2015 UTC,The fact that it is evenly divided is indicative of the widespread homerism/mental illness on this sub.

nyjets,397gxd,jcinema48,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:14:06 2015 UTC,I agree that he hasn't earned anything. But I want a legit competition. Fitz looked solid last year in most games. I do think he gives us our best shot at winning. But Fitz is no sure thing. So a competition must be had. If it's a tie then our best bet is hoping Geno plays significantly closer to his potential. He really does not need to play the hero. He just needs to move the chains and protect the football.

nyjets,398ael,John_YJKR,0,Thu Jun 11 12:41:48 2015 UTC,I saw a power ranking article on r/NFL and it had the jets ranked 23rd but the bills ranked 16th. How is that possible? I don't invest much in preseason rankings at all but the clear lack of logic there irked me.  http://gridironexperts.com/nfl-preseason-power-rankings-2015
nyjets,398ael,sunstersun,2,Wed Jun 10 04:08:24 2015 UTC,the bills were 9-7 and the jets were 4-12.  it's pretty simple actually.
nyjets,398ael,John_YJKR,3,Wed Jun 10 19:22:07 2015 UTC,So when you're picking who wins each week do you assume the team with the better record wins? Analyze how many games the bills barely pulled out by a possession or less last season and then look how many games the jets lost by a possession or less. And that was with literally the worst secondary I've ever seen. The two teams are much closer in talent than people think. The difference is the bills over achieved last season. Compare each unit on the team and then tell me these two teams shouldn't be ranked next to each other. Just using a teams record is a really shallow analysis. It's the type of logic people who have no clue about the NFL use when picking who would win a game.

nyjets,392jod,Stalfo14,6,Mon Jun 8 21:57:56 2015 UTC,This whole thing has been blown out of proportion since it was first brought up this off season. The jets literally don't have to do a deal till after the 2016 season. There's a ton of time left to work out an extension. It does not have to get done immediately like the media is making good it out to be.
nyjets,392jod,John_YJKR,6,Mon Jun 8 22:45:07 2015 UTC,But Mo has indicated that he's growing impatient multiple times. The longer we wait the more acrimonious things can become.  Why go through all that if it's Mac's intention to get a deal done as he's said all along?
nyjets,392jod,mikerhoa,6,Mon Jun 8 23:20:27 2015 UTC,Oh well. He signed a contract for a certain number of years and he can be franchised. It's a business. I am confident that sometime in the next  12 months a deal will be made. It's nothing to get spun up about right now. We still own him for 2 seasons with his current deal and the franchise tag. It's not like we have a QB to use it on.
nyjets,392jod,John_YJKR,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:40:15 2015 UTC,"I hope so. The Jets have a pretty lousy record when it comes to letting their best defensive players get away.

nyjets,392jod,mikerhoa,6,Mon Jun 8 23:47:48 2015 UTC,Revis day don't get away. He was traded. And we ended up with Sheldon. And Revis is back home at two seasons later. I think we won there. 20 seasons is a long time and a lot of different front offices and coaches. You could say the same about a lot of franchises. It's a business.
nyjets,392jod,John_YJKR,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:58:11 2015 UTC,"He was traded mainly because of the two sides' inability to work out a deal.  But I don't want to go down this road.

nyjets,393ph6,viewless25,5,Tue Jun 9 04:45:15 2015 UTC,Seems a little harsh on Amaro. Almost all his drops were because he was trying for the play before the catch. We're not talking Stephen Hill type drops.
nyjets,393ph6,matap821,3,Tue Jun 9 15:02:03 2015 UTC,"I understand that the turnover on NFL players is insane, especially when there are only so many roster spots.

nyjets,393ph6,yankee4357,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:55:28 2015 UTC,It is completely normal for guys picked in the 4th Rd and beyond your either be solely special teams or not on an active roster after a season. This article is looking at the draft through the wrong lease.
nyjets,393ph6,John_YJKR,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:39:25 2015 UTC,"True, but you also usually get more than what we got out of them"
nyjets,393ph6,woodchips24,3,Tue Jun 9 23:46:41 2015 UTC,"I'm really not surprised, look at any NFL draft class, very few players drafted after round 3 make the final roster/make it in the NFL. More undrafted free agents make teams then players from those rounds, that's why those rounds get their own draft day coverage and barely anyone pays attention. This isn't really a big deal that some 4th and 6th rounders didn't pan out, that's why they were available at those spots."
nyjets,393ph6,Dacious96,6,Tue Jun 9 02:16:42 2015 UTC,I agree. This article is focused on the wrong aspect of the draft. Idzik deserves criticism for not packaging late picks and moving up to get more talent. Using all 12 picks wasn't as beneficial as he thought. If he did some trading and we ended up with 7 total picks with better overall talent then who knows who we get.
nyjets,393ph6,John_YJKR,3,Tue Jun 9 04:42:46 2015 UTC,But trading down also gets you hidden gems and other teams have a trade down philosophy and do well (the pats for one). I think our bad luck is also due to terrible coaching staff. A good number of players we release do better on other teams. I don't think it's coincidental a lot of our sure thing picks were barely good enough either.
nyjets,393ph6,boredymcbored,3,Tue Jun 9 08:01:42 2015 UTC,"Actually. The success comes from getting as many picks in the first 4 rounds as possible. A lot of drafts the drop in talent from 3 to 4 is negligible. So getting two 4ths for a high 3rd and a late round pick is worth it. The patriots did that well in the 2000s. They've had less luck recently. We had 12 picks but most of those were later picks. Far from sure things. He could have packaged some to move into the 3rd or 4th. And you cannot say the sure thing picks aren't good. There's no such thing as a sure thing pick. But for arguments sake let's say the first two rounds are sure things. So we have milliner, Richardson, Geno, pryor, and Amaro. Dee has looked good when healthy. I don't fault that pick. He still has time to show he can stay healthy. Sheldon and a amazing and a very quick return on investment. Geno was rated as the best QB in the draft for months until right before the draft. He was still there in the second round. You have to pick him. Very good value for what he showed in college. Pryor played out of position and still graded out above average as a rookie in a shitty secondary. That's actually very good for a rookie safety to play that well. Amaro was the best rookie TE in the league last year. He played well and rumor has it the new coaching staff plans to use him like the receiving TE he is and less focus on him as a blocker. So as far as sure things go idzik did fine. But he def should have made some trades in the 2014 draft."
nyjets,393ph6,John_YJKR,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:32:35 2015 UTC,"He could have packaged some to move into the 3rd or 4th.   I'd have to look at last years draft, but that's a bit of a stretch.  Nobody values #6's that way.  Also, moot, because we couldn't have traded more than one or two #6s/#7.  (Our extra #6s that year were ""compensatory"", and untradeable by league rules.)   BUT picture that franchise doing their homework and actually grabbing a #5 that actually makes the team.  *sigh*   He played well and rumor has it the new coaching staff plans to use him like the receiving TE he is and less focus on him as a blocker.    That sounds a lot less disturbing than what the article said (convert Amaro to an H-back).  I also would consider that a mistake; you want a TE to block as well as catch.  Hell, the unsung stat are WRs who are good at blocking; they tend to help extend every offensive play."
nyjets,393ph6,sameolejets,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:44:27 2015 UTC,"He absolutely could have turned those 12 picks into 8 picks at least. The point is he didn't seem to try to move in that draft. A 5th round pick? Those guys rarely make an impact. The draft is a crap shoot where even 1st rounders bust. After the 3rd the returns are pretty shitty. Where some fans got this notion that they should expect pro bowlers out of a 4th and beyond ill never understand. Just because a team every once in while finds slate pick that's special doesn't mean it's normal. That's what makes it special. As for Amaro, I took it as they are putting him in fewer situations where he will be expected to block. Not that he will never be in those situations or that he won't be developing that skill. Quite the contrary if the truly use him as an h back. It'll be interesting to see what they do there if anything at all."
nyjets,393ph6,John_YJKR,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:28:56 2015 UTC,"He absolutely could have turned those 12 picks into 8 picks at least.    Disagree.  As I've already explained, most of the 6's weren't ""tradeable"" by league rules.  But yeah, 10 training camp bodies into 6 active roster players and most of the rest in PS, sure.     The point is he didn't seem to try to move in that draft.   Ugggghhhh.  Agreeed.  Idzik did get snakebit last year, but last year's draft was a failure; more of those 6 rounders should have made the team, or more of the higher picks.  (And I was whining about this all last season.)   A 5th round pick? Those guys rarely make an impact.   The purpose of the late round players is to make the 53 man active roster.  If they succeed, it should mean the team improved.  They may never take the majority of snaps, but bench players are important in football.  As far as I'm concerned, if a good number of them aren't making the team, it means the franchise is screwing up.  The only ""acceptable"" excuse is that the ""veterans"" are much better players, and the late rounders couldn't crack into the roster.  (But that also means the team didn't improve in composition.)  If Amaro gets inserted as an H-back, it will be a total Chan Gailey call."
nyjets,393ph6,sameolejets,2,Tue Jun 9 22:43:09 2015 UTC,"More undrafted free agents make teams then players from those rounds,   Is that true or hyperbole?  Can you cite a source?"
nyjets,393ph6,sameolejets,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:33:58 2015 UTC,"I really wish I could give you the source, I saw it in r/nfl awhile ago. But one thing to remember, there are more undrafted free agents than players drafted that get a try out in minicamp/OTA and such, a larger pool. If I find it I will let you know.  Edit: Here is a breakdown of the 2013 final roster on what round each player was drafted. As you can see there are a lot of undrafted FA's. Here's a thread discussing how many undrafted FA's are on some other teams."
nyjets,393ph6,Dacious96,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:45:55 2015 UTC,"I really have my doubts.  Its plausible that UDFA as a separate class has more pickups than the individual rounds after 4.  I will not argue that lots of UDFAs make the 53 man roster, and effort may be worth expending in finding good ones.  But 5-6-7 rounders should be able to make the 53 man roster, or the practice squad.  The only franchises that can write them off, are the ones that consistently get starters in the first 5 rounds."
nyjets,393ph6,sameolejets,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:31:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying 4-7 round player won't make the 53 man roster, they are just fewer of those players that make it. 1-3 round player are given more time because they are seen as bigger investments.   For me, personally, I don't expect anything from players drafted in those rounds. I put little stock in any player drafted in those rounds being quality starters/making any significant impact for the team. Again, that's just my personal opinion."
nyjets,393ph6,Dacious96,3,Tue Jun 9 22:52:53 2015 UTC,As a serious question: what else could've been done? I get it wasn't the best draft ever but I'm not seeing a lot of big names near our picks that make ours look that horrible.  Maybe trade up in the second round?
nyjets,393ph6,rafael27diaz,3,Tue Jun 9 02:44:30 2015 UTC,"Look up Martavis Bryant. Taken almost immediately after we wasted two fourth round picks on Shaq Evans and Jalen Saunders.

nyjets,393ph6,viewless25,2,Tue Jun 9 04:50:38 2015 UTC,"Meh, Martavis Bryant was regarded as a massive project for a wide receiver. There were a,lot of concerns about his hands and route running. Seemed just like Stephen Hill 2.0. A lot of people didn't want him, including me. I don't blame us for not making that pick. Meanwhile Saunders was considered one of the top returners and a solid slot guy with speed. Hindsight is 20/20.  EDIT-- I have a lot of faith in Evans. He was hurt all year. He was a solid WR at UCLA. He's fast and had great hands. Let's actually give him a chance before labeling him as a waste or anything."
nyjets,393ph6,the_furry_stoner,2,Tue Jun 9 17:15:17 2015 UTC,"Even playing out of position, I was severely disappointed with Calvin Pryor's rookie year.  He was a mid-#1 round pick; he didn't play anything resembling a starting secondary player.  As a no-brainer for this line of thought, we could have picked up Brandin Cooks.  With deeper analysis, there were probably 5-6 different positions that would have better benefited  (I'm talking value here, not need).  I forgive that level of individual failure on an Antonio Allen, who obviously wasn't a CB, isn't destined to be a FS either, and wasn't a mid-#1 round pick.  The ""best"" likely scenario we'll see from Pryor is a starter who will provide impact with his play, for a couple of years.  That's not what you want from a 1st rounder; you want that impact player you could never afford in FA."

nyjets,391hgy,nixononthebeach,3,Mon Jun 8 16:31:12 2015 UTC,"It'll be intriguing to see which way this season goes for him. No more excuses, if he can limit his turnovers, with the weapons around him, I think he can be at worst a starting-caliber QB that moves the chains and keeps the Jets in games."
nyjets,391hgy,John_YJKR,4,Mon Jun 8 16:37:08 2015 UTC,Turnovers will be the key. He doesn't have to be a hero. He just needs to move the chains and protect the ball.
nyjets,391hgy,sameolejets,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:37:40 2015 UTC,I don't get why neither Geno or his fans realize this.  Its the sole basis why I believe Fitzpatrick will probably be a better QB for the Jets than Geno.
nyjets,391hgy,staiano,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:21:15 2015 UTC,I have a 3rd option.  He can be our backup.
nyjets,391hgy,clarke187,-3,Wed Jun 10 03:19:13 2015 UTC,he is going to break your heart
nyjets,391hgy,xenonprime,2,Mon Jun 8 19:58:00 2015 UTC,Booooooo!

nyjets,391hgy,rauko1228,3,Mon Jun 8 22:00:28 2015 UTC,"im really torn on geno I hope he becomes a great QB for the jets. he has flashes of greatness but I think that's only when he says ""fuck it"" and just ignores all the pressure on him.  I just hope the new coaching staff can help him before he becomes another stat on how the jets have destroyed another QB"
nyjets,391hgy,DefiantBidet,2,Tue Jun 9 00:26:24 2015 UTC,"I hope so too, a lot of promise but he needs the coaching staff to mold him into a franchise guy"
nyjets,391hgy,boomchakaboom,2,Tue Jun 9 00:29:51 2015 UTC,"he regressed last year. even if he leaps forward this year, he's still probably behind where he should be. he's probably done, but he needs to have those last game of the year type performances more than just the last game of the year."
nyjets,391hgy,papi_chulo83,2,Tue Jun 9 17:23:42 2015 UTC,Preseason wil be interesting.  The Jets are in Win Now mode.  I can see Fitzpatrick being the game one starter if Smith is wobbly.
nyjets,391hgy,John_YJKR,3,Mon Jun 8 17:46:52 2015 UTC,i think it would go a different way.... if hes wobbly hes still a game 1-3 starter. If we go 1-2 with some major QB responsible turnovers Fitz is in. But theres not a doubt in my mind they start Geno in the first 3 games.   Unless he throws 5 ints in the first 2 games (each)
nyjets,391hgy,sameolejets,5,Mon Jun 8 18:02:31 2015 UTC,If it's a tie in camp then Geno should start till he proves he can't get it done. If Fitz looks better you go with the better QB. Fitz can also prove crap as well by week 5 and then hope Geno can come in and do better.
nyjets,391hgy,Shrimpola_Cola,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:40:56 2015 UTC,Just look at how well Buffalo did with Kyle Orton.
nyjets,391hgy,ZedSpot,2,Wed Jun 10 00:57:15 2015 UTC,The problem is Geno was sharp last year in preseason.  If they're not AT LEAST 2-2 at the bye week you have to yank him.
nyjets,391hgy,Shrimpola_Cola,0,Mon Jun 8 18:32:22 2015 UTC,"The Jets are in Win Now mode.   Why do you say that?  We have a rookie coach and many of our key players are on multi-year contracts.  Of course, add always ""you play to win the game"" but with all our front loaded contracts we're building a bit for longevity (despite a fair amount of our guys being a little on the older side)."
nyjets,391hgy,John_YJKR,11,Mon Jun 8 18:01:43 2015 UTC,"How much time do Mangold, Ferguson, Harris, Marshall, Revis and Cromartie have left?"
nyjets,391hgy,ZedSpot,4,Mon Jun 8 18:31:49 2015 UTC,Exactly. I think slot of jets fans on here are struggling to go from last years clearly rebuilding team to a win now team. Which we are in win now mode.
nyjets,391hgy,Shrimpola_Cola,2,Mon Jun 8 18:38:50 2015 UTC,"I agree we are in a completely different position as last year.  But I do have a difficult time expecting a super bowl run from a rookie head coach and a struggling QB in the hot seat.  Believe me, that is what I will be hoping for and pulling for,  just not expecting."
nyjets,391hgy,ZedSpot,5,Mon Jun 8 19:17:46 2015 UTC,If the Jets miss the playoffs it will be a disappointing season.
nyjets,391hgy,giobbistar21,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:14:36 2015 UTC,That is very true.
nyjets,391hgy,staiano,2,Mon Jun 8 20:29:32 2015 UTC,"I'm under the belief that if Geno can be at least average, we could compete. And if our defense helps us win games, people will ignore Geno's deficiencies."
nyjets,391hgy,giobbistar21,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:28:13 2015 UTC,"If you want average, why not Fitzpatrick?"
nyjets,391hgy,staiano,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:19:58 2015 UTC,"Because I would like average with a chance to get better as time goes on, not average with no chance of improvement."
nyjets,391hgy,clarke187,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:56:08 2015 UTC,They you definitely don't want Geno.  He's less than average with a chance of even worse as time goes on.
nyjets,3920ly,allwhomwonder,15,Mon Jun 8 17:57:52 2015 UTC,Kind of hard to take any metrics seriously if they have Josh Freeman as the third best at anything
nyjets,3920ly,Shrimpola_Cola,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:22:18 2015 UTC,"The numbers are what they are. To put the Josh Freeman stat into context, although Josh Freeman has the third 3rd best  DVOA under pressure, the percentage of the time he was under pressure was high among QBs (50th) so that means he either walked himself into or was put into situations where he had to make too many plays under pressure. Moreover his DVOA without pressure is even poorer than Geno's. So Freeman basically was too garbage on a consistent basis to succeed. If his DVOA without pressure was higher, he would still be a franchise QB."
nyjets,3920ly,John_YJKR,6,Mon Jun 8 18:35:18 2015 UTC,Eye test is important with the numbers. We need consistency. 4 solid games at the end of the year aren't gonna cut it.
nyjets,3920ly,NannigarCire,2,Mon Jun 8 18:42:04 2015 UTC,The eye test invites bias and can be misleading. Numbers add objectivity. Freeman was a former #1 pick QB that showed flashes but just never put it all together. His excellent DVOA with pressure showcases and summarizes some of his strengths whereas his frustratingly low DVOA without pressure does the same for his weaknesses.
nyjets,3920ly,CosmicWy,3,Mon Jun 8 18:53:52 2015 UTC,Numbers can be used just as subjectively as the eye test. Geno being as good as Dalton by the numbers doesn't take into account how much more Dalton was asked to do in his offense compared to Geno.
nyjets,3920ly,NannigarCire,3,Mon Jun 8 21:18:55 2015 UTC,Sometimes I think it doesn't take into account the eye test of Dalton. Only watched him a few times and I always think k he's terrible.
nyjets,3920ly,John_YJKR,2,Mon Jun 8 22:18:33 2015 UTC,He's not spectacular but he's got just the right combination of skills that make it hard for him to fail. His anticipation and placement on short routes is consistent and a very underrated feature of QBs in general. Dalton's just a bunch of subtle consistent features that work efficiently.
nyjets,3920ly,ABearWithABeer,2,Tue Jun 9 00:13:01 2015 UTC,That's why you use both. Gives you the whole picture. Anyone who has watched both Dalton and Geno play know Dalton is clearly better. That's not to say Dalton is amazing but he's not Geno terrible.
nyjets,3920ly,Nadtastic,2,Mon Jun 8 22:40:03 2015 UTC,Numbers as numbers are objective. The way people interpret those numbers is anything but objective. There is no way to accurately measure a player by only looking at numbers and ignoring context.
nyjets,3920ly,ppss112255,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:13:36 2015 UTC,Well said.
nyjets,3920ly,UhOhSpaghettios1963,6,Tue Jun 9 14:44:06 2015 UTC,This reflects poorly on Dalton rather than well on Geno Smith...
nyjets,3920ly,darkknight915,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:06:54 2015 UTC,Dalton is about as middling as it gets.
nyjets,3920ly,jcinema48,9,Mon Jun 8 21:58:10 2015 UTC,Man you people on this sub will do absolutely anything to believe Geno is a starting qb. I'm a die hard Jet fan and I'll get downvoted for this but Jesus just wait for the pre season to start. People keep throwing out all these stats about how he;s not that bad but he's been pretty terrible in 2 years as a starter. He has 29 career starts and maybe 8-10 could pass for respectable.
nyjets,3920ly,darkknight915,2,Mon Jun 8 23:52:29 2015 UTC,Like its a crime to be optimistic?
nyjets,3920ly,Nadtastic,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:06:00 2015 UTC,"there is absolutely nothing wrong with being optimistic however i feel like the fans on this sub go to extreme lengths to try to make themselves believe Geno Smith is a viable quarterback when that is simply not the case. Look you could throw all the fancy stats and Geno only has 2 interceptions in weeks 9-16 when the temperature is under 35 degrees whatever, basically does he pass the eye test? the answer is a resounding no at least for me."
nyjets,3920ly,sameolejets,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:09:29 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong about being optimistic....delusional is another thing though.
nyjets,3920ly,sameolejets,2,Tue Jun 9 14:45:10 2015 UTC,...and then being vociferous about supporting Geno.
nyjets,3920ly,achokshi,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:55:18 2015 UTC,"The problem is that preseason doesn't really resolve anything.  Sanchez always came out of preseason ""looking"" respectable.  Preseason this year is really for Geno to sell himself to the coaches, Gailey most importantly.    My problem is that I'm not sold on Gailey as an OC or offensive architect.  Geno's real problem is inconsistency.  You can get high grades for completing drills, but it doesn't mean jack during game time.  My real fear is that Geno sells Gailey that he should start over Fitz, and then proceeds to lose ""real"" games in vexing fashion.  Then, do you blame the system or blame Geno?  I tend to lean towards the dinosaur school of football.  It doesn't bother me when an offense makes a high percentage of scores on FGs, as long as it can move forward consistently, and not turn the ball over.  Gailey is spread, and its the antithesis of that philosophy.  Whether Geno wins or loses games on his arm, the Jets offense will lose games because it could not convert on 3rd down & 1 yard.  No one will care as long as the Jets offense can put up flashy passing numbers, but games are won and lost on short yardage too.  Being reliable is more important than being talented."
nyjets,3920ly,Ducci7799,4,Wed Jun 10 00:53:45 2015 UTC,"Breaking news, in light of this new statistical discovery, Geno Smith........ is still brutal! String of consistent performances is all that matters in the NFL, my friend. Geno's inability to do so is disconcerting."
nyjets,3920ly,RacistWillie,3,Mon Jun 8 19:14:14 2015 UTC,"Jeff Van Gundy actually said something like this during the finals, that yeah a lot of guys have potential, and if they can only find consistency.  He then said that the key to being a good player is just that, you have to be consistently good, otherwise you're just potential.  I still think Geno has the physical tools to be a successful quarterback, he just isn't consistent enough to be considered any good."

nyjets,3920ly,achokshi,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:23:30 2015 UTC,"QBR is the only stat which has Geno last or close to last (he's right in front of Bortles and a 0.1-0.3 behind Carr, Davis, and McCown). In virtually every other metric, including PFF's, QB rating and DVOA, Geno isn't last."
nyjets,3920ly,matap821,4,Mon Jun 8 18:38:58 2015 UTC,"Bottom five is still embarrassing, threw a few hundred less passes than any other qualifying qb and yet still has the most ints."
nyjets,3920ly,achokshi,3,Mon Jun 8 18:58:48 2015 UTC,"yet still has the most ints   That's just not true. He was tied for 11th most, but he evened out his TD:INT ratio for the year, which is improvement."
nyjets,3920ly,matap821,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:27:29 2015 UTC,"Just wish he threw more TD's this year but tied last years. Either way the offense was anemic and needed some change, which we now have. Let's see what happens Y3."
nyjets,3920ly,CoywolfExpress,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:48:04 2015 UTC,"He did sit out a few games (plus there was the travesty that was the playcalling against the Bills), so he did basically improve as far as TDs."
nyjets,3920ly,matap821,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:50:45 2015 UTC,"Ok fine just give him the TDs then for the games he didn't play. But you should probably give him more INTs also.   I can't wait till this season starts so we as a fan-base can stop giving Geno so many excuses (e.g. ""miserable surrounding cast"", ""non-offensive minded head coach"", ""awful playcalling"" etc. etc. etc.)."

When NFL games are played at Wembley, is it a major event that people really anticipate?       Do you think we will see a game played at Old Trafford?       Which team fans do you encounter the most?"
nyjets,3916p6,pc_usrs,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:18:27 2015 UTC,"The nfl is still small scale over here compared too football(soccer), but it's growing interest every year with Sky Sports/NFL Gamepass helping considerably.  The sport is followed by easily 10x more than it was 15 years ago, but the growth of the internet probably helps that a-lot.  The game is a huge event for NFL fans (I've had my hotel booked since they announced the game), not just in the UK but in Europe too as London is flyable and trainable for quiet a reasonable amount and most of the games sell out quickly, and Wembley is a 90k capacity stadium! I nearly missed out on getting tickets to the Jets @ Miami game due to ticketmasters website getting flooded for premium tickets.  The game is also good for gaining new fans I've spoken to a few people who ended up at games in previous years with work colleges/friends who had a spare ticket and ended up loving it.  No, never at Old Trafford (I would prefer it, its a 2 hour drive from my house and the hotels are considerably cheaper) The only other place I can see hosting would be the new Spurs stadium when it's ready.  Reasoning: Traffords capacity is 15k less, that's a-lot of money to miss out on.  Its funny actually, they tend to come in three camps and you can normally tell when they started watching NFL:  Old school guys/Kids of old school guys : Miami -> Dan Marino New school guys : Patriots -> Because of he who shall not be named The weird ones : People like me, who picked teams based on random reasons and got interested outside of the 'whos winning right now' fad."

nyjets,38lmxv,JETStheBest,14,Fri Jun 5 00:42:19 2015 UTC,"Has Fitzpatrick played better over both of their careers? Yes.  Does Geno have more potential upside? Absolutely.  Look, you know you're getting a ""meh"" starter in Fitzpatrick or a great back up. Geno could be a great starter, he has all the tools. Will he be? I don't know, but that's why you start him."
nyjets,38lmxv,16semesters,4,Fri Jun 5 03:34:54 2015 UTC,"Geno could be a great starter, he has all the tools.   I've yet to see him consistently make good decisions or deal with pressure like an NFL quarterback."
nyjets,38lmxv,Shrimpola_Cola,3,Fri Jun 5 16:01:07 2015 UTC,Does Geno have more potential upside? Absolutely.   why does he have upside?  simply because he is young?  there's nothing you can point to that suggests he's any better now than he was during Week 1 of the 2013 season.
nyjets,38lmxv,escapingNihilism,3,Fri Jun 5 22:05:55 2015 UTC,I mean you can look at his stats and see that he did improve in basically every category from his rookie to sophmore seasons. Not saying hes our future at qb but he did improve.
nyjets,38lmxv,STNbrossy,2,Sat Jun 6 18:19:36 2015 UTC,"The hope is that the new coaching staff can coach him up better than the Rex Ryan camp could, and although I agree that he hasn't really progressed much since then, week 16 last year gives a little bit of hope."
nyjets,38lmxv,umaro900,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:20:38 2015 UTC,week 17 of 2014 season?
nyjets,38lmxv,CosmicWy,6,Mon Jun 8 23:33:39 2015 UTC,"decidedly not, fitzpatrick is under rated.  That said, Geno is just starting his third year.  So can Geno be a better long term answer? Yes.  Will he be better this year? probably not.  Should he start anyways?  Yes unless he shows he's regressed."
nyjets,38lmxv,yakoos,3,Fri Jun 5 06:03:27 2015 UTC,At the moment I would say no but Smith does have a higher ceiling than Fitzpatrick. Either way I'm glad we have some depth.
nyjets,38lmxv,ThreeCranes,6,Fri Jun 5 04:19:43 2015 UTC,So Geno throws 21.6 passes per interceptable pass. Better than both Flacco and Newton and right behind Brees and Brady. That is interesting
nyjets,38lmxv,TreSeven,8,Fri Jun 5 02:37:43 2015 UTC,I saw that post on r/NFL. That stat is horribly misleading
nyjets,38lmxv,Lukas327,5,Fri Jun 5 14:05:05 2015 UTC,"Just leave them be, Jet fans in this sub are just dying to do whatever it takes to believe Geno is a franchise qb. As a Jet fan I have no faith in him and can't wait for him to be off the team if he doesn't improve this season."
nyjets,38lmxv,darkknight915,8,Fri Jun 5 14:07:24 2015 UTC,Those guys throw a ton more than Geno does. Especially Flacco and Brees.
nyjets,38lmxv,Tchnique,8,Fri Jun 5 03:11:37 2015 UTC,"And therefore more interceptable passes. I think the stat is trying to say that Geno's interceptable passes are just intercepted at a higher rate and that if it was the same as these other QBs they'd have the same amount of INTs if they threw the same number of passes  TL,DR: this stat seems like it's saying Geno is unlucky with the amount of passes that are picked off"
nyjets,38lmxv,TreSeven,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:25:37 2015 UTC,that's probably the Jets factor.
nyjets,38lmxv,laser-TITS,3,Sat Jun 6 03:51:09 2015 UTC,He also was benched for three games and came in midway through the his third. So the INTs would probably be even higher.   The turnovers killed us against Chicago. And we don't even need to talk about Buffalo.

nyjets,38kgac,strayrat,43,Fri Jun 5 00:31:08 2015 UTC,"It's always interesting to think of how our history would have played out if we picked Dan Marino over Ken O'Brien. It's obvious the effect that the south beach drug scene had on him. Having grown up in the most boring city in the continental U.S, Pittsburgh, Marino experienced total abstinence from drugs, girls and fun.When drafted by Miami, it was Dan's first time seeing the ocean, a bikini, and a women under 200 lbs who didn't work in a meat packing plant. If he were picked by the jets, the industrial wasteland that is New Jersey would have reminded him of home, keeping him too relaxed and off of the white lightning. Any city but miami would have brought about Dan's downfall. If he were picked over O'Brien, Marino's Miami cocaine habit would have never fueled his hall of fame career and he probably would have been a bust."

nyjets,38kgac,FairEnough,2,Fri Jun 5 00:28:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah it would've really sucked if we drafted Chris Johnson instead... Or Jordy Nelson, Or Desean Jackson or Matt Forte, Jamaal Charles... or Mister Fucking Irrelevant... I'd take any of those over Vernon Gholston..."
nyjets,38kgac,buick22,3,Fri Jun 5 18:15:59 2015 UTC,"I mean, you're right, but at the same time, we should consider their decision to draft him with a little context. Yes, those guys obviously had more productive careers, but no one was valuing them as top 10 picks. Most of the guys you mentioned didn't even go in the 1st round.   So would the Jets have been better had they taken Jordy Nelson instead? Sure. But you can't really criticize the Jets for not taking him at #6."
nyjets,38kgac,Tchnique,3,Fri Jun 5 18:26:39 2015 UTC,"lol we can do this all day man. especially for the Jets.  2010 - Kyle Wilson & Vlad Ducasse.  after Kyle, we could've got Gronk lol. But we already had Keller at the time, so a TE wasn't a need.   How about 2005 - 2nd round, Mike Nugent? I mean he's still in the league, but a kicker in the 2nd? I understand the hype around him at the time, but look at all the other talent afterwards - Nick Collins, Vincent Jackson, Frank Gore and Justin Tuck. (We also took Justin Miller late in the 2nd round too).  oh and Kyle Brady > Sapp..."
nyjets,38kgac,TreSeven,3,Thu Jun 4 23:25:08 2015 UTC,Warren Sapp over Kyle Brady  Dan Marino over Ken O'Brien
nyjets,38kgac,imfleming,2,Fri Jun 5 03:03:57 2015 UTC,Also 2012 draft - Lavonte David woulda been nice over Coples or Hill
nyjets,38kgac,FairEnough,2,Fri Jun 5 00:11:13 2015 UTC,"As a South Carolina alum, I've been crowing about the Alshon-Hill debacle since the moment we drafted Hill. Now I live in Chicago and I feel like I'm being punished. It still hurts."
nyjets,38kgac,subrhyme,2,Fri Jun 5 00:21:50 2015 UTC,2005 - Don't give up a 1st rounder for Doug Fucking Jolley. Stay there and take Roddy White. Or Heath Miller if a TE was so fucking important.

It would be so sad to see him go but if Leonard Williams plays like a beast this will hurt a lot less.  Whatever it takes to create smart financial contracts and young talent I'm okay with that."
nyjets,38ol9g,notoriousjb87,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:21:46 2015 UTC,"Whats fair return value for Mo though? We're not going to get a franchise QB out of it, I can't find a situation where it makes sense to get rid of him."
nyjets,38ol9g,tps222,6,Fri Jun 5 16:32:10 2015 UTC,A franchise LT? Like Tyron Smith since the Cowboys just signed Collins? I doubt Dallas does that but I don't know who else would be worth it.

nyjets,38ol9g,ynksjts,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:10:59 2015 UTC,He's not worth much because whoever trades for him would have to give him a big contract or risk having him hold out.  At least he signed with us and it's the only organization he's ever played for.  Could you imagine a team trading for him and not giving him a new contract?  It would be one of those situations where the player holds out and reports when it will still count as a year of service.  Not worth trading much for a headache like that.
nyjets,38ol9g,ynksjts,4,Tue Jun 9 09:05:30 2015 UTC,Yes we should.  We can have 3-4 years of the best D-Line in football. Up until we have to worry about extending Sheldon who just might be better than Mo in the long run.
nyjets,38ol9g,FromAshyToClassy,3,Fri Jun 5 16:19:56 2015 UTC,"We can still have the best line for 2 years without extending his contract and taking zero risk, It just isn't best for business is my point.  Not financially.  Sure I'd love if he stays, he is great.  Just talking logically from a front office point of view."
nyjets,38ol9g,the_furry_stoner,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:50:31 2015 UTC,"You make a good point, I think we can keep Sheldon, Snacks,and Leonard for the next 4 years. That could be a really really good line. If we can turn Mo into another piece, like a 1st rounder or starting G/Pass rusher, I think we should do it. If love to keep him but if he wants big big money like 15 mil a year, try and deal him."

He'd secure his future and we'd save some money on the cap.  His cap hit would be 10 and 11, right now its 7 and 15.  Not much savings, but if you can keep a cornerstone happy and save a little money in the process you do it."
nyjets,38ol9g,jamesonlovesme,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:20:26 2015 UTC,I don't think that touches the contract he would get.

nyjets,38ol9g,woodchips24,3,Tue Jun 9 08:43:44 2015 UTC,"The argument seems to hinge on Williams being amazing. That is by no means a guarantee, and we shouldn't be basing our decisions about a confirmed elite player around a guy who has never played an NFL snap."
nyjets,38ol9g,Realistik84,2,Sat Jun 6 01:12:44 2015 UTC,I refuse this logic.
nyjets,38ol9g,danomite555,2,Fri Jun 5 19:30:15 2015 UTC,"It's not like there will be ridiculous amount invested in this line until 2018. Richardson is on his rookie contract until next and he'll receive the 5th year option in 2017. If Wilkerson gets a 5 year deal it'll be up as Williams is reaching his 2nd contract. Harrison and Coples are as good as gone, Wilkerson's contract will not be considerably more than those two combined and well worth it in my eyes."

nyjets,38gl22,McStrauss,9,Thu Jun 4 01:52:46 2015 UTC,"they both IMHO deserved to be ranked higher, but no doubt in my mind they are in the correct order. At this moment Sheldon is clearly the better player"
nyjets,38gl22,danomite555,11,Thu Jun 4 02:17:15 2015 UTC,I don't understand why people keep saying this. I would still put Mo slightly ahead of Sheldon. He's just so versatile and such a monster in the run game. Sheldon is better on the pass rush but I would still give mo the edge in all other areas.
nyjets,38gl22,LDYo,5,Thu Jun 4 02:53:55 2015 UTC,I would say the opposite. Sheldon is elite vs the run but Wilkerson is a better pass rusher. What sets Richardson apart is his unparalleled motor.
nyjets,38gl22,woodchips24,6,Thu Jun 4 03:43:25 2015 UTC,"No question, Sheldon's motor and drive is something else. There were moments in lost games last season where he was still fighting as if it was a tied game. He stood out compared to other players a number of times last year when we were dead and buried. Guy gives maximum effort every time."
nyjets,38gl22,McStrauss,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:33:29 2015 UTC,"This list is for 2014. In 2014, Wilk got hurt, and Sheldon was the better player. But otherwise I think mo is the better player"

nyjets,38eshu,otomotopia,12,Wed Jun 3 19:37:25 2015 UTC,"Last season, my seats were $65/game for each game, preseason or not. Now the ticket prices are built in such a way that the preseason games are worth less at face value, and 4 regular season games are worth a few bucks more. With the end result still being $65/game per seat.  Doesn't really change anything for me at all to be honest, but figured you'd all like to see."
nyjets,38eshu,ExDiscoKittyCat,2,Wed Jun 3 19:08:41 2015 UTC,Makes sense. The total season amount doesn't change but the best games just have a higher price? No controversy here.

But thinking about it now, I think this helps, it provides a more reasonable baseline for the price of a ticket per game. Though I still think the preseason games are absurdly overpriced and really should be given to season ticket holders for free.   Ultimately, it comes down to how the team on the field is, if there's a playoff push at the end of the season, the game vs. New England becomes the hottest ticket in town and can get good money regardless of the price printed on the ticket."

nyjets,38d6zl,Shrimpola_Cola,9,Wed Jun 3 14:22:09 2015 UTC,I think mcdougle's injury was less severe than milliners. Take it with a grain of salt though. He was a 3rd round draft pick with other injury issues and has yet to play a down in the NFL. Still don't think it's crazy that he has a shot.
nyjets,38d6zl,Lloyd__Braun,5,Wed Jun 3 14:48:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, but remember, he was a huge reach in the 3rd round."
nyjets,38d6zl,sjets3,3,Wed Jun 3 16:08:25 2015 UTC,"Wasn't it because of injury, not talent? Either way I'm just speculating. It's hard for a third round pick who's played like 3 college games in the last two years to have the edge over milliner. But given milliners recurring injuries, crazier things have happened."
nyjets,38d6zl,Lloyd__Braun,3,Wed Jun 3 16:17:14 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly he wasn't a reach based on talent or potential but because he was coming off an injury.  Like, he wasn't a 5th round talent drafted in the 3rd but a 3rd round talent that could have been grabbed in the 5th."
nyjets,38d6zl,CoMaBlaCK,6,Thu Jun 4 16:24:43 2015 UTC,I remember that he was a steal in the 3rd round.
nyjets,38d6zl,Shadune,7,Wed Jun 3 16:11:02 2015 UTC,"I've heard people say both. But if he was our guy, we did the right thing by grabbing him. The draft is unpredictable and who knows if he'd have made it to the 4th. We'll see how he pans out."
nyjets,38d6zl,jvene1,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:09:01 2015 UTC,McDougle hasn't played a snap of football in almost two years. I would be blown away if he's ahead of Milliner on the depth chart.
nyjets,38d6zl,Tchnique,4,Fri Jun 5 03:15:03 2015 UTC,"I think he's a developmental cornerback who could be in line to replace Cromartie when he's done. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Milliner and Dex both use the time that Revis and Cro are here to get as much information so that they can immediately slide in."
nyjets,38d6zl,giobbistar21,3,Wed Jun 3 15:33:52 2015 UTC,Dex is an intriguing CB. I remember him really impressing last year in training camp. I still have high hopes for him. I can see him being a player in the nickel even with Buster Skrine coming in.  CB battle will be very interesting.
nyjets,38d6zl,buick22,5,Wed Jun 3 15:20:01 2015 UTC,I wonder if he could be utilized similar to how Bowles used Mathieu in AZ.

Sure he looked good in his one preseason game and yes he is a hard worker and it would be great if he is a future starter, but  He's going on almost 2 years without seeing any real action.   He was a 3rd down reach in draft that was so bad it factored into getting the GM fired.   He is injury prone and undersized."
nyjets,38d6zl,ExDiscoKittyCat,3,Wed Jun 3 20:39:16 2015 UTC,"I am as confused as you are.  No football in two years. You cannot discount that. And this isn't no football in two years after playing in the NFL. This is no football in two years AND never having played a single snap in the NFL.  If preseason was a massive indicator of how players perform, the '08 Lions would've won the super bowl."

If Geno can play serviceable this year he may be able to save his career as a starter."

nyjets,389l2a,stagggerleee,20,Tue Jun 2 19:58:49 2015 UTC,THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN
nyjets,389l2a,Therealbradman,5,Wed Jun 3 00:42:26 2015 UTC,Cro just clarified on Periscope about this. Apparently he didn't mean it as a complete insult just that Sherman plays well in the system that is different and tends to put him against 2s and 3s. He is a good corner for the system but he hasn't played against 1s really to judge.
nyjets,389l2a,Bslo18,6,Wed Jun 3 01:44:08 2015 UTC,Sherman is a good corner but for me it is very simple. If we swapped Sherman and Revis I have no doubt in my mind that Revis could do what Sherman does in that scheme. Can Sherman follow around the #1 WR with no help and shut him down the whole game? I doubt it.
nyjets,389l2a,games456,8,Tue Jun 2 22:32:20 2015 UTC,"He's absolutely correct. Sherman is good, but he's one of the most overrated players in the league. Dude talked a bunch of shit to Revis when Revis was out covering #1s while Charmin was stuck on one side of the field playing against 2s and 3s. Hell, he only became known because of a meme."
nyjets,389l2a,BigNuke43,12,Tue Jun 2 20:56:28 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go so far to say that he's totally right. Sherman is absolutely an elite corner in the league. But  Cromartie definitely has a point about Sherman's supporting cast and only covering one side of the field.   I'd take Revis over Sherman, since Revis has shown time and again that he can carry a defense. Sherman hasn't. It's hard to fault Sherman for this, since he has never needed to chase 1s around or carry a defense. I'd just rather take the guy who has a track record of doing so."
nyjets,389l2a,ohsweetman,3,Tue Jun 2 22:09:29 2015 UTC,"Sherman is good, but *he's one of the most overrated players in the league.  *   This is why I'm salty. During the superbowl we got a shot of Sherman after every other play, even when he was on the sideline, but Revis was busy locking his man up and barely got mentioned. Over the next week every casual fan I know was convinced Sherman outplayed everyone on the field.  It's annoying that Sherman gets a lot of attention and other talented defensive players don't get any love. I appreciate Cromartie pointing out just that.   ""Darrelle Revis has done that his whole career. I've done that, [the Cardinals'] Patrick Peterson has done it, [the Browns'] Joe Haden's done it,"""

nyjets,38a9g8,xenonprime,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:33:19 2015 UTC,He avoids contact and doesn't go for it with the gusto others do.
nyjets,38a9g8,woodchips24,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:21:27 2015 UTC,"Tackling has very basic fundamentals that all the best tacklers in the league have perfected. Things like staying low, tackling with a wide base, exploding from the hips, keeping short strides when moving in for a tackle as to not overshoot the opponent, watching the opponents hips, driving up through the opponent, wrapping up, etc. Cro likes to do the 'arm tackle' approach and I see Cro shy away from contact all the time. He pulls back. Like I said, great cover guy, horrible tackler."
nyjets,38a9g8,datkidbrad,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:28:46 2015 UTC,Cro either arm tackles or launches his shoulder at the ball carrier.  It's something a lot of DBs do in the league instead of wrapping up.

Greene may have just broken the tackle anyway, but Cro didn't even try, just let him go right by uncontested.  He still does this sometimes and it bothers me."

nyjets,388p5p,viewless25,10,Tue Jun 2 17:07:50 2015 UTC,"Trading him now makes zero sense. He has zero leverage. He's team controlled for this season and can be tagged next season. He's going to have to play balls to the wall this season to keep Leonard Williams from getting his snaps. If we were to trade him, either this year or next makes no difference. Whatever team is dealing for him knows he needs an extension. They would be in the trade to keep him from negotiating on the free market."
nyjets,388p5p,LennyLongshoes,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:10:26 2015 UTC,"That's kinda my point. When he gains the negotiating leverage, his trade value goes down. So we should either trade him now, ride with Leonard Williams, and maximize our return on Muhammad. Or we roll with four starting defensive linemen in a 3-4, try to find the money for Muhammad, and pray to God Geno doesn't become a franchise quarterback"
nyjets,388p5p,LennyLongshoes,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:09:33 2015 UTC,His trading leverage will remain the same unless Leonard Williams is a bust. There's no point in trading probably our best player right now while he's firmly under the team's control.

nyjets,388p5p,FromAshyToClassy,7,Wed Jun 3 03:03:22 2015 UTC,It's clearly now or never. He won't have nearly this much value next season. It'll be franchise tag or cut him next season.
nyjets,388p5p,brad_smiths_shoe,5,Tue Jun 2 17:25:58 2015 UTC,No way they'd ever cut him. At the very least we'd get a lowball trade offer from a team wanting to keep him off the market. Not that it would make me feel much better...
nyjets,388p5p,DatGrag,2,Wed Jun 3 02:37:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed, everyone knows that if we don't trade him now then we will not be trading him.  It is looking like we will not be ever trading him."
nyjets,388p5p,FromAshyToClassy,2,Tue Jun 2 21:46:54 2015 UTC,If he plays the first snap this season I'd be really surprised if he's not still playing with us 5 years from now
nyjets,388p5p,Ghopper21,2,Wed Jun 3 02:40:45 2015 UTC,"I fear we missed our best chance to trade Mo at max value -- before the draft. Williams reduces Mo's trade value as teams know we are overstocked. But yeah, the longer we wait, the less we'll get."
nyjets,388p5p,ThreeCranes,3,Tue Jun 2 23:27:29 2015 UTC,I don't know what we will get for him right now. We don't know the draft order for next year and because he has a year left on his contract teams will be reluctant to give up alot(unless he agrees to a contract extension on the spot).   We could always tag and trade in the offseason next year.
nyjets,388p5p,rafael27diaz,2,Tue Jun 2 17:30:27 2015 UTC,"This sounds reasonable to me. I want to keep him a Jet but if we see the big picture (the organization benefit as a whole), the trading should've been before or during the draft.  Waiting for next offseason and assess our options knowing what Leonard is capable of is, IMO, the safest plan."
nyjets,388p5p,rillo561,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:28:07 2015 UTC,"we won't get as good a return on the tag and trade. His tag cost will be 16 Mill, but his current cost is just over 6. he's much more valuable at 6"
nyjets,388p5p,the_silent_thriller,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:44:32 2015 UTC,"Na, I think after this year it'll happen. Jets seem to have no interest in signing him this year. I think they are waiting on the rookie to see what he can do, along with Geno. If Geno crashes and burns and the rookie does pretty good, they'll use Mo as a trading piece. IMO of course."

Wilkerson is also 10x the man Suh is (personality wise and off the field).  Watch Suh's performance decline drastically this season now that he's gotten paid....

The deal contains $60 million guaranteed, including a $25.5 million signing bonus and each of Suh's first three base salaries. 2015: $985,000, 2016: $23.485 million, 2017: $9.985 million, 2018: $16.985 million, 2019: $18.985 million, 2020: $18.36 million, 2021: Free Agent"

nyjets,387g78,baisketball,9,Tue Jun 2 11:53:20 2015 UTC,"When you think Rookie year 1 with zero weapons and his improvement in year 2 during the ""Rex is leaving town show"", it's easy to believe that Geno can play at an NFL average level.  It's very easy to believe that he doesn't as well.  He has showed us so far in his career that he can play lights out and that he can completely stink.  We will know for sure by October 4th if Geno is going to be our QB.    The early bye will be very beneficial for the Jets and the Geno situation.  If after 4 games Geno is terrible, then we have a bye week to bring Fitz up to speed with the First Team."
nyjets,387g78,CosmicWy,2,Tue Jun 2 13:00:55 2015 UTC,"This is it. THE judgment year. With the weapons he has, Chan Gailey's spread concepts, third year as a starter, if he doesn't improve there aren't really many more excuses for us as a fanbase to throw Geno's way.  He has stared down receivers, he has processed slowly MORE OFTEN than not (which is very disconcerting); some of us like to give him the benefit of the doubt and blame coaching, poor receivers, or poor line play. If Geno doesn't show us some success this year it's bye bye time. No more excuses thrown his way. 12 and 21 and 13 and 13 ain't gonna cut it in this league (TD:INT). I do believe he can be an average qb in this league; however, will it be this year is the question.   I don't believe anything you've said to be wrong (referring to your argument with John), but I also believe you may be giving Geno a bit too much credit in reference to his eyes. His biggest weakness is slow processing. Not sure if it's a part of the system he was playing in or lack of open receivers, but like I said, this year his excuses won't be there to back up awful play. Led the league in long sacks (>3.5 seconds)!"

nyjets,387g78,Mattyzooks,3,Tue Jun 2 15:00:44 2015 UTC,"You have to take the good with the bad.  You can't look at Fitz's Tennessee game then either!   In the dolphin's game, regardless of the talent on the field, Geno played well.  This is the main takeaway.   The whole year was an improvement, the completion % went up and his TD:int ratio improved.   What else measures individual success?"

nyjets,387g78,CosmicWy,0,Tue Jun 2 15:26:13 2015 UTC,It may be statistically significant but his numbers are still shit.
nyjets,387g78,John_YJKR,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:01:35 2015 UTC,these shit numbers are right in line with Fitzpatrick's career averages.
nyjets,387g78,CosmicWy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:04:36 2015 UTC,So what? Last year Fitz played well with legit pieces on offense. He's never really had any play makers. He was also a 7th Rd pick that was very raw starting out. He's our best chance at winning. Geno isn't suddenly going to get rid of the ball quicker or not stare down receivers or be oblivious to wide open receivers. He doesn't process the game at the speed he needs to. Most QB never get over that if that's their issue. I hope I'm wrong about him and he plays well. But I'm not gonna sit here and pretend its likely he is gonna be better than below avg.
nyjets,387g78,John_YJKR,3,Tue Jun 2 20:29:59 2015 UTC,"Dude. Fitzpatrick has had an offense with T.O./Stevie Johnson, Lee Evans, Fred Jackson, & Marshawn Lynch, and Add CJ Spiller in there, too. I will also add that he was, no doubt, great last year.   But all of these statements you regurgitate ""stares down WRs, doesn't get rid of the ball quickly"" just aren't accurate. Do they happen sometimes? Yes. Sometimes a 2year QB does these things.  But when you say he didn't improve, you're just wrong.  I watched last night a package that Geno crushes.  He did not stare anyone down and made amazing reads.  He is capable of making NFL plays.    You also do this thing... ""Geno won't improve, you're crazy to have hope, but i (as in you) also hope, won't pretend he'll improve.""  It's your equation.  It's how you disagree, then agree, but dismiss someone's argument.  It's annoying, because you're adding to the discussion positively, then just pulling the rug out to 'win'. Whatever, we'll move on to fitz though...  It's taken fitzpatrick 4 seasons to become a consistent 60% passer and it took him around 27 games played (over the course of 6 years) before he could bring his TD:INT back to 1:1.  You're saying that this guy, Fitz, who was a slinger, was able to conquer the same criticisms that you're dishing out at geno, but Geno cannot?  Come on.  Your uneven pessimism is driving me nuts.  There's no reason to think Geno cannot post an 85 QBrating, 25:15, 3200 yard season.  Will he?  idk. could he? sure! That type of QB play is what you can expect from Fitz. Why not give a talented young QB the shot?  Why not want him to succeed?  Instead, you're negative before the conversation starts."
nyjets,387g78,CosmicWy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:53:53 2015 UTC,Lee Evans   I haven't heard that name since he and Billy Cundiff rolled out the red carpet for the Pats' 2011 super bowl appearance.
nyjets,387g78,brad_smiths_shoe,-4,Tue Jun 2 21:29:18 2015 UTC,Give it up. I'll never agree with you on this. What are you genos agent or do you just want to suck his dick? I don't get why you won't accept its likely we've seen what Geno is already. The reason you're so frustrated with my argument is you know I have a point. I don't care about winning an argument with you. I just care about reality. And the reality is that right now Fitz is gonna win us more games. I don't care if Geno needs more time. Fuck that. He sucks right now and if his ceiling is a Fitzpatrick then why waste our time waiting 2 more seasons for average QB play. I think Fitz can repeat similar production as last season with our team. None of those players played well on those buffalo teams. Everyone knows those teams weren't good. If Fitz didn't play well last year is say fuck it let Geno go out and see what happens. But the fact is just last season Fitz did well so I'm gonna go with him. Unless Geno blows us away in camp. Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? No. If you were betting and bet he will you are going against heavy odds. You likely wouldn't make that bet if you had something riding on it.

nyjets,387g78,whydont,2,Tue Jun 2 12:57:24 2015 UTC,"I've been getting very excited about this season, but the QB position is the only thing that scares me.  Geno doesn't have what it takes.  I think Fitzpatrick is the better option.  If we end up with a mediocre season, it's going to be because of this one major gaping hole in our offense."
nyjets,387g78,gizram84,2,Tue Jun 2 18:15:32 2015 UTC,Can you say without using Geno or Fitz last year as examples:  What makes Fitzpatrick a good option at quarterback for the Jets?
nyjets,387g78,CosmicWy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:17:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't say he was a ""good"" option, I said I think he is the ""better"" option.  Why can't I use Geno's numbers from last year as an example?  Geno only has two seasons of professional stats under his belt, and they're both pretty bad.  His numbers have never been great.  Fitz at least has some solid mediocre seasons.  For the last 4 seasons, Fitz's completion percentage has been better than both Geno and Sanchez during both of their careers playing for the Jets."
nyjets,387g78,gizram84,0,Tue Jun 2 20:12:17 2015 UTC,"solid mediocre   I wanted to lead you down to the fact that fitz has been marginally better than geno these past four years.  This past season was the best of his career and its unlikely that after nearly a decade in the league, Fitz is about to become a top 8 QB.  Geno's number last season fall right in line with Ryan Fitzpatricks career numbers.  The only thing we forget is Geno still has the opportunity/ability to improve.  Fitz is going to be Fitz.  So in the current state:  Geno's floor should be seen as last year, whereas Fitz's floor should be seen as his career average.   When comparing floor's to ceilings, I think Geno's is higher than a 10year journeyman."

By that point Revis, Harris, Cromartie, Marshall, Ferguson, Mangold etc. will all be off the books and on cheaper deals if they re-sign. By the end of Wilkerson's deal it will be time for Williams' 2nd contract. So I'm fully behind keeping the d-line in tact.

nyjets,388x5j,BigNuke43,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:53:48 2015 UTC,"Well, although I have hope Geno makes improvements this year, is the team anywhere close to having a franchise QB? Is the team even within the length of Mo's potential extension (let's say 6 years) before having to think about paying a franchise QB?  Let's say Geno fucking blows and Petty isn't much better either, that means the Jets are back to square 1, drafting a rookie QB who will be cheap for at least 4, maybe 5 years if round 1. That gives the Jets a whole lot of flexibility with Mo, and I think Mac knows this.   The reason the team was able to sign Revis (plus everyone else) is because there is no franchise QB, and there may not be one to consider financially for another 5 years. Mo's contract becomes the franchise QB contract (well, Revis' is for the time being) and allows the team, as a whole, to compete at a high level while still trying to find that stud QB.   Honestly, the stars have kind of aligned in this situation. Mo gets paid, and when his contract is coming to a close, a potential franchise QB gets paid. The scenario will not likely be as perfect or as easy as that, but it's an idea that gives me less worry over paying Mo."

It'd be very much a throwback since our current unis were really just a more compact, modern spin on the classic design, plus the helmet rule would matter seeing as the helmets are identical aside from the logos being slightly different.  Miami did that this year with their new throwback, too."
nyjets,386jf3,BigNuke43,2,Tue Jun 2 17:13:00 2015 UTC,"what do you mean? When we play with the Titans jerseys, we use the Titans helmets."
nyjets,386jf3,JeezusChristIII,8,Tue Jun 2 06:05:57 2015 UTC,"You notice how we haven't worn those throwbacks in the last few years, though? It's because of the helmet rule. They have to wear the current white helmets with the throwback jerseys, and I'm sure Woody thought it'd look dumb and just decided not to have us wear them anymore. Teams are allowed to change the decals, but they have to use the same helmet. It's part a safety rule they put in place a couple years back.  The Patriots also haven't used their throwback uniform since then, either. The Packers have, but you'll notice that they use their regular yellow helmet and simply remove the decals.  Unless there was a silent change of that rule, or the league can give exemptions, I doubt we'll have an 80s era throwback, which is what the helmet would suggest."
nyjets,386jf3,BigNuke43,8,Tue Jun 2 08:56:59 2015 UTC,"If true, this is the clearest example of No Fun League"
nyjets,386jf3,JeezusChristIII,4,Tue Jun 2 12:05:16 2015 UTC,"It's true. Basically, it was about how using the same helmet throughout the season was safer for the players than using multiple. I mean, if the helmets are fitted, I really don't see what the problem is, but the NFL is probably looking to do anything to show they're dedicated to player safety. That's why they're pushing this ""heads up football certified"" stuff so hard. It's just an image thing, and the NFL's image right now isn't very good."
nyjets,386jf3,BigNuke43,2,Tue Jun 2 12:17:12 2015 UTC,"Also for the future, if you ask players to use different helmets they can sue again saying the NFL forced them to change helmets by week exposing them to risks. They'd rather that not be an issue, a case of the NFL trying to cover their asses."
nyjets,386jf3,Dance_Monkee_Dance,3,Tue Jun 2 16:42:19 2015 UTC,"The helmets need to be approved by the NFL before the start of the season.   The first year that Nike took over the Bucs had to use their creamsicle with that years current helmets.  As, as long as they are approved we can see the Sack Exchange helmets. I believe last year we saw Green Bay use the ""leather"" brown helmet and the Bears with the solid blue helmet.  Edit: Creamsicle not Creampuff.  Edit2: Nope.

nyjets,386c5p,whygohomie,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:58:49 2015 UTC,Pro football focus has him as the highest rated center in the league so losing him would be devastating.
nyjets,386c5p,ynksjts,2,Wed Jun 3 08:46:03 2015 UTC,"Tackles, center, Brandon Marshall, safety, middle inside linebacker, Revis. Any one of those go down and the talent level drops catastrophically.  But you are right, the other positions and players have talented backups waiting in the wings that will be giving them a run for their money."
nyjets,386c5p,otomotopia,5,Tue Jun 2 12:20:30 2015 UTC,"No doubt if any star gets hurt it will hurt, and no team has a Revis/Marshall caliber player on their bench so yah there will be a drop off.  My point is soooo many teams would be worse off than us.  In the event Marshall tweaks a hammy, or deals with what Decker did last year, we have Devin Smith Shaq Evans and Posey battling it out.   These are the caliber of guys that came into the season fighting for starter last year, now they are where they belong as backups yet still have potential.    And Dee Milliner as a backup behind Revis ain't too shabby."
nyjets,386c5p,ynksjts,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:48:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, huge difference from last year.  I like how we brought in guys who have started  and are on cheap contracts to provide depth at inside linebacker and running back.  Erin Henderson was a starter for the vikings before personal troubles bounced him from the league.  Joe Mays has started, even Lattimore who was brought in more for special teams has started a few games.  Ridley and Stacy have experience being lead backs."

That was a huge part of him in college and was one of the few bright spots of his rookie season. Devin Smith can bring a lot to this offense."

The final statement he makes about him is exactly what his biggest issue is, he doesn't play complementary football. Geno is quick to switch from 'playing the game' to 'playing hero' once he feels like the game is starting to get away from him. It's why he's so streaky. Surprised Brooks says he's good at anticipation throws ""that break inside."" Saw a lot of lateness myself, but Brooks has more experience than me."

nyjets,385au6,Realistik84,2,Tue Jun 2 04:02:04 2015 UTC,"Not always, and Geno's not entirely able to- not with the way he does it. Geno would take a risk throw on 1st and 10 while down one touchdown that would result in an interception instead of going through the rest of his progressions. He'd look away from chain moving plays in order to see the rest of the field. Rodgers is more than willing to throw to his first read if it's open, Geno has to be too."

Would have been nice to get a look at him with Harvin for the whole season but that's a whole other conversation.  This year, we've given him another weapon in Marshall, a burner in Smith who will draw deep help and Amaro should be much better in his second year.  I'm hoping that Marshall will play with a chip on his shoulder and he'll take to the bright lights of playing in NY.  He'll have his ups and downs, but I think he'll be a solid game manager. He had 13 td's and 13 int's last year, wouldn't be that much of a stretch to see 18/10 ratio.  And that's all we need.  If that happens, look out because where coming."

nyjets,383dz4,John_YJKR,5,Mon Jun 1 16:50:28 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I like the move or not. One of his biggest advantages is the amount of room he takes up in the middle. If he can replicate and replace the actual physical presence with strength while increasing his stamina however, he may have a bigger impact just by being able to push the pile and stay out on the field."
nyjets,383dz4,otomotopia,2,Mon Jun 1 16:17:24 2015 UTC,"Ironically, he weighs five pounds more than he did at the end of last season as he's added more muscle as he shed fat this winter and spring.   He's 5 pounds heavier now. That was in the second paragraph of the article. Judging by the no of up votes, not many people got too far :)"
nyjets,383dz4,mwax321,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:28:50 2015 UTC,"I read the whole thing. Did you see the part where they mention his newlely svelt figure? It literally said it looked like he went down a pant size. He's thinner. Remember that muscle weighs five pounds more than fat, so he became less fat, gained more muscle, and lost inches."
nyjets,383dz4,otomotopia,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:16:34 2015 UTC,So why would being stronger and heavier reduce his ability to move a pile?
nyjets,383dz4,mwax321,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:55:32 2015 UTC,"He doesn't just move the pile, one of his biggest strengths is the space he can take up to clog a gap just by being there. He now takes up less space and has to change his technique as such.  Like I said, he may be able to push the pile better but his technique has to slide closer to DE than NT simply because his actual physical size is smaller. Same weight, different size."
nyjets,383dz4,otomotopia,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:10:22 2015 UTC,Losing a pant size isn't going to make your shoulders or hip bones magically shrink. He is still a big guy with a huge frame. I don't see any problems being faster and stronger.
nyjets,383dz4,mwax321,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:16:19 2015 UTC,"The depth and line rotation is going to get him out for plays and that's not a bad thing. Also, it's not simply his size that makes plays. He has great technique and does not miss tackles. If he plays faster, advantage Jets."
nyjets,383dz4,Superjam83,3,Mon Jun 1 16:50:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, he has great technique, but he uses his pure horizontal size WITH his technique. What he excels at is removing the A gaps from the equation. With Harrison on the line, you physically could not shoot between your center and guard. That's the advantage he had. I'm hoping he still retains that while being able to push the pile with the new muscles.   DL coach Pepper Johnson should have some fun with him. He's the guy who coached Wilfork and Ninkovitch after all. Harrison is somewhere between the two."

nyjets,380ze0,CosmicWy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:29:14 2015 UTC,"Seeing that makes me really excited about where his potential lies in this new team. Better offensive system, receivers and a slightly better O line can really help him. His ability to get out the pocket is great. A simple system and good QB coach to get him a better and more observant passer would improve his game 10 fold."
nyjets,380ze0,boredymcbored,7,Mon Jun 8 16:01:25 2015 UTC,The line gave up 47 total sacks in 2014. Good for 25th in the NFL. 23 sacks after giving him forever to get rid of the ball is half the total sacks given up. Yes there were occasions the line let guys through. And its easy to remember something like that despite its rarity. But 23 times just for long sacks? How many times did they give him an avg. Amount of time and he got sacked? I mean it's not like he had >3.1 seconds or 1 second. The clear problem was Geno and not our line. It explains us being ranked 8th in pass protection despite our sacks and sack rate being poor. Sacks aren't always an indication of bad oline play. Don't get me wrong. Our right side has issues. But our line as a whole played good enough for Geno to have plenty of time to miss whomever he decided to throw to. Here's hoping he takes a massive leap forward in such a short time.
nyjets,380ze0,John_YJKR,2,Mon Jun 1 05:46:04 2015 UTC,"you should give this a read.  it's pretty interesting.  the main take away, however, is this little tidbit:   We introduced time to throw data for the 2011 season, and it opened up an entirely new way of looking at the game. Initial instincts tell us that time to throw is a function of an offensive line’s ability to protect the quarterback, but we’ve found that it’s better used as an indicator of a quarterback’s style and a team’s offensive scheme.   This is promising.  It doesn't necessarily indict anyone, but shows what the times really were and that small changes in any of the QB, qb playing style, line, or offensive playbook may have a drastic effect on the time to throw."
nyjets,380ze0,CosmicWy,0,Tue Jun 2 13:27:18 2015 UTC,I know and I've read this and even used it as evidence when having this argument in the past for fans that are in denial about what Geno is. Yes Geno has wheels and avoided a lot of sacks. He also had one of the most amount of time in the pocket of any QB. And one of the highest time to pressure. The numbers were from 2013 I believe as 2014 requires paid subscription. So I wouldn't get too carried away with the idea that the only reason he had time was he's so elusive. He does have a high elusive rating. But don't kid yourself. The line gave him plenty of time. Just look at the difference in time to pressure and time to throw. It's pretty negligible. The only huge difference is when they measured greater than 3.6 seconds. Time to throw was 4.89 showing Geno is pretty elusive. But his time to pressure was 2.95 which is plenty of time. Can the scheme be blamed? Maybe a little and sometimes the line messes up but most those sacks are on Geno.
nyjets,380ze0,John_YJKR,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:10:45 2015 UTC,"Great points about the sack totals in relation to the amount of time Geno held onto the ball.    Also consider how many of those sacks resulted in drive killers with us looking at 2'nd and 3'rd n' longs.  We either played it safe and punted, or we had Geno force risky throws.  I think getting rid of the ball in rhythm is something that will be improved this year."
nyjets,380ze0,mosherd14,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:28:19 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't so much the o-line as much as a system that doesn't allow Geno to get rid of the ball quick enough. Add in the improved WRs it should be a lot easier for him to get the ball out quicker to open, more talented receivers."
nyjets,380ze0,John_YJKR,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:25:01 2015 UTC,That is bs. Guys were open and he didn't see them. He'd constantly miss his window. I hope he gets it together but I am not optimistic.
nyjets,380ze0,mrnotoriousman,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:50:45 2015 UTC,"Some of those can be attributed to receivers not getting open, which means Geno needs to learn when to just throw the ball away."
nyjets,380ze0,John_YJKR,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:09:45 2015 UTC,That's another criticism I have about him. He would sometimes backpedal 10 yds and get sacked when he could have gotten rid of it.

nyjets,380ze0,sameolejets,2,Mon Jun 1 05:14:19 2015 UTC,"The thing about scoring in the red zone is that its harder than it looks.  Football is not about scoring in the red zone.  Its about scoring enough to win the game.  There's no such scheme that scores lots of TDs without an ""elite"" QB."

nyjets,380ze0,John_YJKR,3,Mon Jun 1 01:38:23 2015 UTC,Yeah the line got criticized for the sack rate and I keep saying Geno processes the game slow and holds the ball too long. I knew what I saw.
nyjets,380ze0,achokshi,2,Mon Jun 1 02:33:56 2015 UTC,Slow eyes. It pains me to watch how long he takes to process his reads. :(
nyjets,380ze0,ridunkulous,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:04:25 2015 UTC,"I am not even sure if it's slow eyes. I think he's basically traumatized or have been coached to not take unnecessary risks. I can't say with 100% certainty because I don't have the view of the WRs routes and how open they are when I watch the games, but when I do see the WR routes, it feels like Geno doesn't make the throw unless it's WIDE open.  Either he doesn't have the ability to throw passes in tight window or the coaches have told him not to so that he doesn't throw interceptions. This causes him to look for 2nd, 3rd, 4th options, resulting in holding the ball longer and taking sacks.    It also feels like he's not very good at recognizing the blitz and skipping to 3rd or 4th option immediately once the ball is snapped for easy yards.  There are times where a team will overload blitz him on one side, leaving the running back wide open for easy dump, and Geno still will be fixated on the first option WR.  This is a big reason why I am a pretty big non-believer of Geno but hopefully Geno will prove me wrong this season (or hopefully Fitz will lead us to glory)"

Looks like Carpenter is the LG for sure and Aboushi is at RG, at least for the time being.

nyjets,380ze0,sameolejets,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:04:09 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I think we should have tried to either get someone better than Aboushi, or drafted a rookie at a level likely to replace him.  Just because Aboushi did a serviceable job last year, doesn't mean he's going to be shoving away pass rushers or creating the holes for a 20 yard run.  I must be the only guy who thinks a beast o-line (with an above average rusher) can make all offenses look great."

In any case, the OL can't radically improve (LT, RT, C) until next draft season.  But there's a big difference between suspecting you may have to replace Brick and Giacomo and knowing you need to replace them."

nyjets,37zpxs,SeniorEustice,10,Sun May 31 19:44:14 2015 UTC,Pryor def deserved more credit than he was given last year given the situation and him being a rookie. He made some bad mistakes that stuck in everyone's memory but graded out above average among safeties at his position which is good for a rookie. He performed better than a lot of veterans that are starters on their team. He will only improve this season. I really hope he tears it up this year back at his true position and silences his critics.

nyjets,37zpxs,John_YJKR,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:46:39 2015 UTC,People were expecting too much from a rookie. We should expect rookies to make mistakes at times. The speed of the NFL is a different animal and it takes time. Especially for a safety. Even as a first round pick. We are talking about a safety. That's a difficult position especially in today's league. The idea that he has to be top 10 in the league his rookie year or he's a bust is ridiculous and shows a clear lack of understanding the game or the circumstances the jets were facing. I expect mcdougle and shaq Evans along with our rookies this year to make mistakes at times. It's normal when adjusting to the speed and level of sophistication of NFL opponents. They are no longer one of the only NFL caliber guys on the field. Every player they face has been the best player on their team their whole lives.

nyjets,37vvzb,John_YJKR,3,Sun May 31 08:53:59 2015 UTC,"After last night, I can't wait for football. I need some sports to be hyped about, and I think we're gonna be real good. QB situation is still a little shaky, but we should be able to just rely on the defense."
nyjets,37vvzb,2nuhmelt,6,Sat May 30 23:26:05 2015 UTC,"Hoping that Geno plays at least average is a long shot unfortunately, so our QB position is no where near good enough to merit a 19-0 hype train. You dont go 19-0 by being average: you do it by being the best damn team thats ever played the game or have luck help create that skill gap."
nyjets,37vvzb,OneManArmy77,3,Sat May 30 22:30:26 2015 UTC,Obviously I don't really think we are going 19-0. But I do think we are gonna be a wildcard but lose in the wildcard game
nyjets,37vvzb,OneManArmy77,2,Sat May 30 22:44:51 2015 UTC,"I could see that. I could see a scenario where we win the division too, but now it all rides on Bowles and the team to play to their potential"
nyjets,37vvzb,LooReed,2,Sat May 30 22:45:41 2015 UTC,"Why shouldn't we be?  Because we are in a completely new system - new OC, DC, HC...new star players, new starters, new backups.  Our defense may have some prodigal sons returning but it still will be a learning process for them under Bowles new schemes.  From what I have gathered, Bowles is extremely creative and even created a Position for Mathieu which was a FS/SS/LB type position playing in the box a lot.    While we look great on paper and will most likely be a formidable opponent to other teams, we still have one glaring hole - a hole that happens to be the most important position on the field...QB.  And as each season progresses, the position becomes more and more essential to a team's success.  It's not like it's 1996 and you can get by with a mediocre QB and great facets of every other part of the game.  The game has evolved to the point where QB play is what makes or breaks a team.  Defenses and Offenses are built upon it.  So to make it short: 1. We lack the most important position  2. We have an aging Offensive Line and poor pass protection to protect the worst part of our team. 3. We have a bunch of new players that will need to build chemistry. 4. We have new coaches and a new system to implement. 5. Last but not least, we have a division that is possibly the best in the NFL.  We play each team twice and none of them can be written off as automatic wins whatsoever.  While I find our team scary to prepare for, we still have weaknesses that other teams don't even have to pick at.  That being said, if we DO get legitimate QB play (which I think is possible), we are going to shock the fucking world."
nyjets,37vvzb,John_YJKR,4,Sun May 31 00:55:29 2015 UTC,We were 8th in pass protection last season.

The Cardinals last year played with Carson Palmer half the season, then Drew Stanton, then Ryan Lindley and STILL made the playoffs. Also, there was no Daryl Washington, no Darnell Dockett, basically that team scraped through. If the Cardinals can do it in a division that consists of the past three NFC Super Bowl representatives, then the Jets can do it as well."

Wideouts and backs are talented and deep and the line has to step it up. The elephant in the room is Geno, but all he has to do is be a game manager and they will have a chance to win a lot of games by keeping teams out of the end zone.   I've been a fan since going to Shea as a kid and there has been a lot of years where there was nothing to look forward to. This time, though, the potential is certainly there to be a playoff team and that's all you can ask for as a fan."

Russell is a young dynamic franchise QB. The only player who would carry weight is Wilkerson who they won't actually be able to afford, they have a bunch of their own guys awaiting new contracts.  TO get Russell you'd probably still be looking at something like Wilkerson + 1st + multiple seconds or even Wilk + 2 1sts.  As good as Wilk is he's nothing compared to a franchise QB."

Rivers is getting older but he's better than most QBs in the league and way better than anyone the Jets have had in a looooong time. Wilkerson is great and all but if Leonard Williams is gonna be as good as everyone says he's gonna be, then Wilkerson (I hate to say it) becomes kinda expendable. I don't think Geno is gonna amount to anything so I couldn't care less if he's traded. I love Ivory but, with Stacy and Ridley on the team, he's expendable too. Hate to lose that draft pick though.

nyjets,37uheh,TweetPoster,1 point,Sat May 30 14:29:47 2015 UTC,"The best part of the Marshall trade for the Jet's was that the Bears ate all the dead money in the trade which not only gave him a modest cap hit, but also made it cheap to trade or cut him if things didn't work out -- I don't know what this does to dead money, but I am surprised they restructured. Also, Marshall didn't have a no trade so why does he get to get teams to bid for him with promises of more money -- it would seem the Bears go to decide where to move him, not Marshall. He was locked up for 3 years so he would not have much leverage in holding out or refusing to play. I don't really get it -- its a small raise so won't radically change much, but I don't quite get it from a contract standpoint."

nyjets,37p435,CatfishHugo,26,Fri May 29 08:03:27 2015 UTC,"Since I'm not really a Fox supporter, here's the article:  Brandon Marshall and Geno Smith are so determined to build chemistry as teammates with the New York Jets that they have decided to move in together.  According to the New York Post, Marshall moved into Smith’s New Jersey home about a month ago. The two have a close relationship and got together in South Florida to work out shortly after the Jets acquired Marshall from the Chicago Bears back in March.  “This is a first-year offense,” Marshall said. “If you guys are expecting me to be a [1,500]-yard receiver, that’s high expectations. If you’re expecting Geno Smith to go out there and crush it, I don’t know how possible that is. It’s a first-year offense with new guys, new faces. We’re behind the eight-ball. We have to put in extra work to catch up to those guys that have been together five, six, seven years.”  Marshall said he has been impressed with Smith’s maturity level and how much he already knows about the game of football. “I was just blown away by his maturity and how much he knows,” he said. “This kid is really smart. The sky is the limit for him.”  Smith, a former West Virginia star, is entering a pivotal third season. He appeared in 25 games for the Jets over the past two seasons and threw 25 touchdowns and a whopping 34 interceptions during that span. He needs to do a better job of protecting the football, and having a true possession receiver like Marshall should help.  The Jets drafted former Baylor quarterback Bryce Petty in the fourth round, but new offensive coordinator Chan Gailey recently said he expects Smith to be the starter.  If Marshall and Eric Decker can stay healthy, Smith could have one of the better wide receiver duos in the league. But if Smith struggles like he did last year, problems could arise quickly in New York. We saw the way Marshall’s relationship with his last quarterback ended, after all."

nyjets,37nuwk,MongoJazzy,9,Fri May 29 16:23:37 2015 UTC,"Not really. He knows the team will only have 3 qb after Petty was drafted and this was inevitable. But the jets had no reason to cut him this early so he requested it sooner to give himself a chance to get added elsewhere with a better chance at at least a 3rd string. Also gives him more time to learn new offense if he does get picked up. Honestly it was a smart business decision for him.  Edit: i meant in terms of him ""dropping out"" bc he's not good enough. I think he absolutely has the ability to out perform Petty but that's not the direction the team wants to go. But I do agree I don't think he will be around the league much longer. But this gives him the best chance."
nyjets,37nuwk,seannymo,2,Fri May 29 21:01:05 2015 UTC,"Most teams carry three qbs the starter, the back up, and the project third. Simms realizes they're not cutting Geno, regardless  if whether he is a starter or back up. If fitz isn't starting he's arguably the best back up in the league. And they just drafted Petty so at best he'd be fighting for practice squad or a rare qb 4 slot. He's better off going for a team where he can fight for a back up spot rather than a qb3 one."

nyjets,37nuwk,rvbcaboose1018,4,Fri May 29 00:38:42 2015 UTC,"I believe Simms was out of practice squad eligibility, so he would have to stick to the 53. Jets will almost certainly carry 3 QBs to keep Petty off the practice squad where he could be poached, or he could get ""injured"" and go on IR where he doesn't take up a roster spot. He didn't have much of a future here."

nyjets,37mzl7,justafIeshwound,8,Thu May 28 20:40:11 2015 UTC,"Just ran across this from /u/harusoul in /r/nfl here   *New York Jets: A *  Re-signed: DE Leger Douzable, LB David Harris, LS Tanner Purdum, OL Ben Ijajana, OL Willie Colon, RB Bilal Powell  Veteran additions: CB Antonio Cromartie, CB Buster Skrine, CB Darrelle Revis, ILB Jamari Lattimore, OT James Brewer, OG James Carpenter, TE Kellen Davis, DT Kevin Vickerson, S Marcus Gilchrist, DE Stephen Bowen, RB Stevan Ridley, QB Ryan Fitzpatrick, WR Brandon Marshall, LB Erin Henderson, LB Joe Mays, WR DeVier Posey, RB Zac Stacy  Veteran subtractions: S Dawan Landry, WR Greg Salas, DE Jermaine Cunningham, FB John Conner, DT Kenrick Ellis, CB Kyle Wilson, QB Michael Vick, ILB Nick Bellore, WR Percy Harvin, CB Phillip Adams, TE Chris Pantale, FB Mario Harvey  Draft picks: 1-Leonard Williams (DE), 2-Devin Smith (WR), 3-Lorenzo Mauldin (LB), 4-Bryce Petty (QB), 5-Jarvis Harrison (G), 7-Deon Simon (DT)  Analysis: The Jets commanded the only A grade overall and the only A-plus from an individual voter. Riddick liked their moves that much. He worked with Todd Bowles in Philadelphia and he believes in the Jets' new head coach, calling him a ""dynamite"" hire. Adding Revis in free agency, Marshall by trade and a luxury first-round choice in Williams separated the Jets.  ""It is hard to find a fault with anything they did from coaching to free agency to the draft,"" Riddick said. ""It is all about the QB. Can Chan Gailey get Geno Smith to not be the cause of losing games?""  Polian said the football gods smiled on the Jets when Revis became available and New York was able to sign him away from its top division rival.  ""Defensively, there may not be many teams better,"" Polian said. ""You just cannot waste a defense like that with a quarterback who turns it over. The question is, does Geno all of a sudden become a quarterback? Or does it have to be Fitzpatrick?""  Fitzpatrick headed my list of value signings in free agency based mostly on a statistical profile suggesting he has been better than his reputation suggests. Tennessee was certainly worse off without him, and it's fair to wonder if Houston upgraded by swapping out Fitzpatrick for Brian Hoyer. Fitzpatrick has generally been associated with horrible defenses (since 2010, only Tony Romo has gotten less defensive support among players with at least 40 starts).  ""Fitzpatrick is not good, but he is a major upgrade,"" Williamson said."

He knows he's a defensive guy and made a point to spend time learning the offense so he could talk to his guys and give input. If you read Collision Low Crossers, you would know Rex was very hands off with the offense and basically ran the team as a defensive coordinator. I don't think Bowles will put up with BS and people will have to prove the deserve to be on the team.

nyjets,37jhsg,jrg114,2,Thu May 28 02:54:40 2015 UTC,I get people want Geno to be better and that would be ideal for us. But the amount of shit I've been getting for saying he won't beat Fitz in a competition is ridiculous. You don't fix mental flaws with a new system.  It's likely he never adapts to the speed of the game. It's just one of those things that is rarely fixable.
nyjets,37jhsg,John_YJKR,9,Thu May 28 03:47:31 2015 UTC,"You've never been given shit for thinking Fitz will beat out Geno.  You've been given shit because you say Fitz will win, then (regardless of contrary reasonable discussion) dismiss anyone who thinks the opposite.  This usually comes with calling any commenter a synonym of unrealistic and even throwing a tom brady argument in there (classic strawman).   We all believe the team is in good hands with Fitz and his 95 QBrating (i'd call you delusional to think he will ever reproduce that).   We just believe Geno (who showed marked improvement from a absolutely terrible rookie campaign to a kinda awful sophomore campaign) will improve to a decent 3rd year.  If his year 3 shows the same improvement as he made from year 1 to year 2, he BECOMES THE FITZ CAREER AVERAGE.  You do not know Geno nor do you coach Geno, so none of us know his mental capabilities and which mistakes on film were his or someone elses' (i.e. geno's awareness to fix the green bay TD pass: TO was marty, the forced INTs in buffalo were marty and rex).  There were setbacks in what was consistency to him.  One game he's given the keys to the car.  The next he rides the pine. The next he hands it off 50+ times to the RBs.  It is very likely that Marty and Rex were as much to blame as Geno for his own personal setbacks."
nyjets,37jhsg,CosmicWy,1 point,Thu May 28 15:45:15 2015 UTC,"seriously.  However, Mallet is gonna be good.  I think he'll be a top 15 qb. HOWEVER, what's more telling is that they really replaced Fitzpatrick as the backup with Hoyer.  HOYER IS FUCKING GOD AWFUL.  So, that's actually the more important fact."
nyjets,37jhsg,CosmicWy,-1,Thu May 28 16:27:45 2015 UTC,I'll tell you again. You are in denial about Geno. Why you couldn't tinge to think he has shops chance of being better than Fitz I don't know. Is it possible? Yes. And I've definitely admitted its possible before and stated I'd prefer that outcome. But it's nowhere near likely. Marked improvement? He barely improved. I don't need to be his coach. I know what I see when I watch the games. And I haven't missed a game in years. Geno slow going through his progressions. He holds the ball too long. I have very little hope he improves the amount he needs to in a single off season.
nyjets,37jhsg,John_YJKR,5,Thu May 28 16:29:27 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that game was less mental mistakes and more forcing it to Harvin no matter what in double and triple coverage.
nyjets,37jhsg,matap821,6,Thu May 28 21:34:22 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it was a coaching decision to force it to Harvin
nyjets,37jhsg,akaneel,5,Thu May 28 04:53:50 2015 UTC,I'm not talking about just that game. Snap after snap he is staring down receivers and not processing at the speed he needs to. He holds the ball too long. It's just not clicking for him. After 30 games we should have seen more from him.
nyjets,37jhsg,John_YJKR,2,Thu May 28 05:23:36 2015 UTC,I think he is going to be much better this year and I do not think the system will have anything to do with it.
nyjets,37jhsg,games456,-1,Thu May 28 07:16:19 2015 UTC,I hope you're right. Rarely do players make the leap that Geno needs to in a single off season. He'd truly have to be an exception to the rule. I haven't really seen much from him that would make me think he's capable of that. The good news is I wouldn't be too concerned with one bad day at practice. Everyone has a bad day every now and then.
nyjets,37jhsg,John_YJKR,1 point,Thu May 28 05:24:19 2015 UTC,You fix mental flaws with working day in and day out and studying I think if he puts in the work like he supposedly has been he'll be fine
nyjets,37jhsg,jrg114,4,Thu May 28 07:19:46 2015 UTC,Most guys that get to the league and have issues from the neck up to the severity that Geno has it do not ever adapt. It's one of those things that you mostly have but need polish or you don't have it and you likely won't ever. Could he be an exception? Of course. But I wouldn't bet on it. After playing in 30 games we would have seen more than just very slight marginal improvements. I so hope I'm wrong and Geno comes out there and kills it. That would mean we have a QB that's 24 and will only improve going forward.
nyjets,37jhsg,John_YJKR,3,Thu May 28 03:59:09 2015 UTC,"If it was a matter of putting the work into it just to fix mental errors most QBs coming out of college would be successful. It's not. There are a lot of QBs out there with tremendous physical tools. It's how the game comes to them mentally. Some QB's it clicks quickly and the game slows down year 2 or year 3. Some QB's, the game never slows down, and it may not even be their fault, they just might not be capable with their mental makeup.  The slow eyes part of Geno has been a huge factor of his demise. He has some success when gets a ton of time back there in the pocket. That's just not going to cut it for consistency in the NFL, many QB's would be successful if you have a ton of time in the pocket. That's why they usually give 3 years for quarterbacks. It's do or die for Geno, the game needs to slow down for him THIS YEAR, or his starting gig in the NFL is more than likely over.  Don't take my word for it though, read this quick article by Kurt Warner, the mental game is impossible to judge and everything for a college QB's ceiling:  http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-05-04/nfl-quarterback-projections-evaluation-process-draft-jameis-winston-marcus-mariota-rookies-history-kurt-warner"

Losing Gordon, Austin, Cameron and replacing them with Bowe, Hartline and ?( Who's playing tight end for them?) Does anyone warrant a double team in the passing game?

nyjets,37guun,mandelbratwurst,3,Wed May 27 15:53:16 2015 UTC,"lol, while I do agree that Sanchez has been doing well in philly, I think that what we've seen from him is not enough to single-handedly beat our current D. So if they're gonna win, other factors have to play against us before Sanchez having an elite QB level game."

nyjets,37hesr,Wellitjustgotreal,14,Wed May 27 17:42:51 2015 UTC,"That's how it should be. We know what Fitz has. We don't know how much, or how little, Geno will progress. This is year 3. If he doesn't show some sort of substantial progress we can move on. I want hi out there though. I still think this is the best shot he'll ever have. And mark my words, Geno to Devin Smith will be deadly. That deep ball is no joke. Smith2 here we come."
nyjets,37hesr,the_furry_stoner,10,Wed May 27 18:12:12 2015 UTC,I have zero belief in Geno's ability to put together a consistent string of games. It's going to be tough to watch because I totally believe our defense will play lights out.   Geno's proved again and again he's got slow eyes and can't play consistent. We will go nowhere fast with him under center.
nyjets,37hesr,achokshi,8,Wed May 27 18:00:32 2015 UTC,"Well I'm glad the Jets asked you on your opinion, because we all know the Jets fan base is very respectful and would never for example, boo Geno or get a GM fired would they?  Anways No one cares whether you believe in Geno it's about whether Bowles and Gailey believe in him and all signs are saying they do"
nyjets,37hesr,jrg114,8,Wed May 27 19:11:40 2015 UTC,"We don't want him under center anyway, we want him in the shotgun throwing bombs down field."
nyjets,37hesr,TJLAWISAFLUFFER,2,Wed May 27 19:17:27 2015 UTC,this guy knows whats up.  Geno has that nice deep ball.

nyjets,37hesr,wcstyles,2,Wed May 27 19:59:08 2015 UTC,"Ofcourse he did, but never has a fan base rented out billboards and planes to fly over the field to be sure the GM got fired. We are such a reactionary volatile fanbase, it's just not good for the organization especially since Woody Johnson listens to us!"
nyjets,37hesr,jrg114,2,Wed May 27 20:01:48 2015 UTC,Idzik was on his way to being fired.  All the cap space he had saved up on was precisely to have an offseason like the jets just had.  All of the negative press forced Woody's hand.
nyjets,37hesr,CosmicWy,1 point,Thu May 28 13:22:34 2015 UTC,"You mean all signs are saying Gailey believes in Geno and Bowles isn't 100% aboard? Cause that's what I'm getting from their pressers. You do realize we've seen this movie before (HC and OC on different pages). Bowles cleared the air really fast though to stop any potential media firestorm cause we know the press is bored this time of year.   I'm hoping the new system can tame Geno's wild inconsistencies, but I believe I'm rightfully dubious about it. When I say system, I mean the entire team as a whole, all sides of the ball (offense, defense, special teams) merging together to create synergies ultimately in the form of wins. It doesn't help that this system is going to be a first year one though, so I'm going to mitigate my expectations cause our schedule ain't a cake walk."
nyjets,37hesr,achokshi,2,Thu May 28 13:18:57 2015 UTC,"if we are going into this season with one, if not the best defense in the league, shouldn't it be expected for Geno to look bad and struggle?"
nyjets,37hesr,ocyries,2,Wed May 27 19:12:36 2015 UTC,"I think the idea behind a QB competition is that each player is on even ground; the between QB wins.   With Geno, this isn't the case. He has the advantage, hes getting 1st team reps, he doesn't necessarily have to be the better QB, he just has to not fuck up. It's a battle, and right now Geno is the defender, meaning its his advantage. He can still lose, but he would have to be injured badly or Fitz would have to shine. I'm not even giving any attention to Petty being good this year, thats just not happening."
nyjets,37hesr,rvbcaboose1018,2,Wed May 27 20:52:55 2015 UTC,Competition please. Was pissed when I heard Chan basically handing over the job
nyjets,37hesr,rillo561,2,Wed May 27 21:02:02 2015 UTC,"All these reporters calling it a mistake to name Geno the starter are idiots.  It's all about building his confidence but they are more interested in selling newspapers.  The organization has to find out if he is our guy going forward.  Remember how many were calling for Vick to be the starter last year?  When he was given a chance, he was a disaster."
nyjets,37hesr,ynksjts,1 point,Thu May 28 18:48:04 2015 UTC,"In his first OTA of the season Fitzpatrick looked good and Geno looked horrible, according to this: http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york-jets/post/_/id/51535/new-york-jets-ota-observations-ryan-fitzpatrick-returns-to-team-drills   It wasn't a particularly crisp day for quarterback Geno Smith, and that's being kind. He struggled with his accuracy from the outset, even in positional drills against ""air."" He was a split-second late in delivering the ball on some routes, which can be expected with a new offense. At times, his ball placement was off, even on completed passes. He also took a delay-of-game penalty with under 30 seconds remaining in a two-minute drill -- a big no-no.   I'd almost be willing to bet money Fitzpatrick will be the Jets starting QB by week 3, if not week 1. Fitzpatrick may not be great, but he's a legit and proven starting quarterback. Geno Smith still hasn't even cleared that hurdle, and I'm not sure he ever will."
nyjets,37hesr,VALIS666,1 point,Thu May 28 00:16:54 2015 UTC,"Chan really ought to shut his damn mouth. He's not the HC, so he has no place to be naming anyone a starter. Now Bowles had to come out and publicly clean his mess up."
nyjets,37hesr,BigNuke43,2,Thu May 28 02:53:18 2015 UTC,"this is more of a manufactured story than not.  Chan said if something along the lines of 'if you're going to make me say yes, then it's geno'  but Geno is also the starter right now through camp bc the other QBs are Broken leg Fitz and a rookie.  Geno is the starter.  He will be the starter unless someone takes it from him.  This story has zero controversy, yet everyone thinks its ""too soon to name a starter"" and ""oh noe! trouble in HC/OC paradise.""   What bowles is doing right now is not PR clean up."
nyjets,37hesr,CosmicWy,-4,Thu May 28 13:33:06 2015 UTC,It just seems like even this new coaching staff isn't on the same page. Gailey is excited to work w/ Smith one week and the next week Bowles says there is an open competition.
nyjets,37hesr,jetsfan07,6,Wed May 27 17:32:18 2015 UTC,"lol that's extremely overdramatic.  Bowles said Gailey is too open with his answers. The only reason Bowles is backpedaling on the ""Geno is starting"" statement is because Geno was abysmal today."
nyjets,37hesr,Tchnique,6,Wed May 27 18:37:31 2015 UTC,"They are. Just because you're excited to work with someone doesn't mean that they aren't competing for a job.   Look at Gholston and Rex.

This comment is being blown out of proportion."
nyjets,37c0nc,ExDiscoKittyCat,8,Tue May 26 15:14:12 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. Slow media time. Taking a competition remark and making sound like the guys job is on the line. No way Dee gets cut. There was all of trade interest before the draft. Not saying they would trade him but they definitely could get something for a guy who has shown promise and was a #1 pick two years ago. Dee will compete and most likely be the #3/4 corner, sit and learn from the pro-bowl caliber starting 2.   Hopefully this will help his development and allow him to not rush back from injury so that he can step in next year or the year after when cromoartie is gone since there is no garunteed money after this year for cromartie."

nyjets,37agwk,pungsvett,8,Tue May 26 04:30:57 2015 UTC,It's likely we don't have a FB next season. So Stacy will likely make the roster. I think there's a real chance Cumberland is cut. Look for Wes saxton to potentially replace him. Simon is potentially moving to the oline so that should be interesting. You are right. The jets practice squad is going to be popular this season.
nyjets,37agwk,John_YJKR,2,Tue May 26 10:24:21 2015 UTC,I really want stacy to make the team.  I think the Jets may have found another Ivory like steal via that trade.   Stacy battled an injury last season and was made redundant/expendable by Benny Cunningham catching lots of passes out of the backfield and Tre Mason stepping up as a between the tackles runner.
nyjets,37agwk,CosmicWy,2,Tue May 26 15:30:07 2015 UTC,I think Stacy can be our skat back. He's shown promise in the pass game. He's young and can potentially be beast for us.
nyjets,37agwk,John_YJKR,2,Tue May 26 18:58:38 2015 UTC,"The 2013 season is an amazing example of what he's capable of.  1100+ yards from scrimage, against the seahawks, the 9ers, and the cards - all of which were top rush defenses.  Stacy put the team on his back and followed through."
nyjets,37agwk,CosmicWy,1 point,Tue May 26 19:18:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, our WR core is probably our biggest strength. Something I haven't heard in a long while. I expect our WR and CB cuts to be vultured. Even our safeties."
nyjets,37agwk,Assjuic3,4,Thu May 28 02:46:08 2015 UTC,I do not see Ridley beating out Stacy for a RB position.  Ridley is going to regret that tattoo.
nyjets,37agwk,CosmicWy,4,Tue May 26 12:27:06 2015 UTC,"Just a few thoughts on the roster.  I think Latimore was signed more for special teams to replace Bellore than for depth, so I think he makes it.  If Cumberland is cut, we save over a million on the cap.  If Stacy makes it over Powell, we would save about 650k on the cap and have him on a cheap contract for next year.  Not sure how it's going to work out, but the cap savings could be the tie breaker if everything else is close."
nyjets,37agwk,ynksjts,6,Tue May 26 05:18:24 2015 UTC,"i think powell is safer than most make him out to be.  Ridley, Ivory, and Stacy all run a similar style: downhill, one cut, do not shy from contact.  Powell and Stacy's skills overlap with their ability to receive out of the backfield, but I think the similarities end there.  Maccagnan also gave Powel a $2mil contract this offseason, so i he'd be hard pressed to cut a player he valued more than a Ridley - who only received a $750k contract."
nyjets,37agwk,CosmicWy,4,Tue May 26 12:26:10 2015 UTC,"I agree. Powell was underutilized last year and had nearly 1k all purpose yards in 2013. In 2014, when he had at least 4 rushes a game he was averaging over 4.6 ypc. And he's a talented pass protector. The guy can ball."
nyjets,37agwk,otomotopia,2,Tue May 26 14:01:10 2015 UTC,"The only things I would change are TJ Barnes over Vickerson, Stacy over Bohanon, Lattimore over Mays, and Reilly over Enemkpali"

nyjets,37agwk,matap821,1 point,Tue May 26 11:44:39 2015 UTC,"The few bad kicks are what count. He is a chocker. He always shanks the ball when there is some pressure. I don't care what PFF's score are in this case. He needs to be like Nick Folk, consistent."
nyjets,37agwk,Redd-It-Here,1 point,Tue May 26 19:07:18 2015 UTC,"The most glaring one to me, which I remember a lot of complaining about, was against San Diego. We we backed into our own end zone so there was very little time to get the ball in the air. The ball made it to iirc the 20-30 yard line, where it immediately went out of bounds. That looks to me like it was an actually quite brilliant call from special teams as it didn't allow any possibility for running it back."
nyjets,37agwk,matap821,1 point,Tue May 26 19:23:19 2015 UTC,Yeah. Quite brilliant. The guy sucks under pressure and we are going to painfully find out how much again.
nyjets,37agwk,Redd-It-Here,1 point,Wed May 27 01:40:11 2015 UTC,"Again, I don't even think that was sucking under pressure. That looked like a call made by the special teams coordinator in a shit situation that the offense got into."

nyjets,374i30,MrGreggle,2,Mon May 25 00:21:48 2015 UTC,This is way too believable.
nyjets,3754a5,Koolaidascope,44,Sun May 24 23:27:30 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why so many Jets fans are down on Pryer.    Pro Football Focus ranked Pryor as the 26th best safety in the entire  NFL. They had him ranked 17th in run support and 46th in pass-coverage.   Packers rookie Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, who people seem to think had a good year, was ranked 70th overall and 76th in run support.  And that was with Dix playing in a much stronger secondary."
nyjets,3754a5,editnonameedit,14,Sun May 24 23:58:26 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue with Pryor last year was that he often seemed to take very poor angles on ballcarriers, giving up larger gains than he should. The most egregious of these I can think of was on that 90 yard run (or something like that) by Miller in week 17.  While Pryor may have been rated well by PFF, he didn't really make any memorable plays at all last year. That's probably where the animosity comes from."
nyjets,3754a5,McStrauss,5,Mon May 25 02:25:05 2015 UTC,You can attribute some of those mental errors for playing out of position the same time as trying to ease into the pro game.
nyjets,3754a5,Rugger11,1 point,Mon May 25 05:13:37 2015 UTC,"I agree, and I do have high expectations for him this year. But I understand why people would be very down on him. He really hasn't done anything of value with the Jets yet aside from laying a few good hits in preseason."
nyjets,3754a5,McStrauss,1 point,Mon May 25 05:19:53 2015 UTC,"He looked so good in preseason playing SS, so that was a glimpse as to what he can achieve."
nyjets,3754a5,Rugger11,2,Mon May 25 05:24:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, but plenty of players have had fantastic preseasons and gone on to never do anything of substance in their careers. Not saying that's him, but preseason success isn't much of an indicator."
nyjets,3754a5,McStrauss,2,Mon May 25 05:39:06 2015 UTC,But Cruz in the preseason...
nyjets,3754a5,HaruSoul,2,Mon May 25 16:21:18 2015 UTC,Russell Wilson too
nyjets,3754a5,TheHeartTreeSeesAll,2,Mon May 25 16:51:35 2015 UTC,I think for most players on defense a lack of memorable plays is a good thing. Like the best player who does his job the greatest is the one you don't hear about
nyjets,3754a5,derpaderp1,1 point,Mon May 25 14:12:11 2015 UTC,"Yea, he missed a tackle against GB on a long TD during their comeback, it was a big play, and he got beat-up pretty bad by the press and fans over it.    But, Jordy Nelson has done that to a lot of guys. .  .  .   My biggest issue with Pryor last year was that he often seemed to take very poor angles on ballcarriers   I just didn't see that from him last year.  He took a couple of bad pursuit angles on WR's, but it wasn't something that was occurring against RB's in the run game."
nyjets,3754a5,editnonameedit,1 point,Mon May 25 16:56:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I was pissed about that long Jordy TD but then Jordy did it like three more times against other teams

nyjets,3754a5,ChangeThisXBL,3,Wed May 27 01:45:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, the important thing about the Gilchrist signing and the main reason I wanted McCourty so badly is that you arent just getting a good (hopefully) FS, you are putting your SS back into position, meaning you are getting a player and a half instead of just one player here"
nyjets,3754a5,OneManArmy77,3,Mon May 25 01:45:33 2015 UTC,"probably why Dix is considered ""better"""
nyjets,3754a5,RollerCoasterMatt,3,Mon May 25 04:31:00 2015 UTC,And that was with him playing out of position too.
nyjets,3754a5,Rugger11,2,Mon May 25 05:12:45 2015 UTC,He certainly didn't look like the 26th best. This is one of those times the eye test and PFF don't necessarily march up
nyjets,3754a5,woodchips24,3,Tue May 26 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"This is why the eye test is not a measurement tool.  Even when you watch every play; talk radio, the local fans, and even the jets coaching staff are going to color your view of pryor differently.   the little things that pryor did well on one of the jets worst defenses in years, are not going to rise to the top of your awareness.  Also, any rookie mistakes that he makes are going to be in the forefront of your awareness because that's the better talking point in new york.  Of course, i'm making the assumption that you are not going back and watching tape through the lens of a professional football analyst lens.  If you are, then by all means, I apologize."

nyjets,3754a5,mytoemytoe,5,Mon May 25 00:35:57 2015 UTC,"Considering I just bought his jersey and use his flair, I'm really counting on him being a stud. I'm all in."

nyjets,3754a5,Totally_PJ_Soles,1 point,Mon May 25 20:36:59 2015 UTC,New to football here and was somewhat disappointed by Pryor's performance last season since he was wrecking it during preseason. But what is the difference between Strong Safety and Free Safety? I'm also glad that Pryor and Gilchrist will both be playing their natural positions.
nyjets,3754a5,xenonprime,4,Mon May 25 19:21:57 2015 UTC,"Free safety is more about coverage and helping in the passing game. ""Ball hawk"" is sometimes used as a descriptor for very good ones.  Strong safety is similar in athleticism to the free safety, but is usually used heavily to stop the run and can play closer to the line of scrimmage than the free safety. ""Strong"" kinda relates to the hard physicality these players use in the game.  In today's NFL, look at Earl Thomas (FS) and Kam Chancellor (SS) on the Seahawks. It doesn't get any more prototypical than that."
nyjets,3754a5,jcinema48,1 point,Mon May 25 20:39:20 2015 UTC,"I know their's overlap sometimes for the responsibilties of safeties, but can someone tell me why Pryor was playing out of position as a free safety?  Why draft a strong safety and play him at free safety?"
nyjets,3754a5,ynksjts,1 point,Sat May 30 02:32:26 2015 UTC,how about an interception?   and I don't see why Gilchrist is a better fit at FS than Pryor. Gilchrist played SS at San Diego and CB in college. what part of that means he's a FS?
nyjets,3754a5,viewless25,6,Sun May 24 23:48:34 2015 UTC,He is a better fit at FS but SD has Weddle there.
nyjets,3754a5,wcstyles,3,Mon May 25 04:06:29 2015 UTC,He is a FS and was forced into playing SS.
nyjets,3754a5,Rugger11,-4,Mon May 25 05:14:32 2015 UTC,No. No he's not.   Look at this   Calvin Pryor on being moved to Jets' strong safety: 'Music to my ears'
nyjets,3754a5,Axel3419,9,Mon May 25 05:51:47 2015 UTC,"I was talking about Gilchrist, not Pryor. Gilchrist is a FS who was forced to play SS last year. Pryor is a SS who was forced into playing FS last year. This coming season, the both of them will be playing in their proper positions."
nyjets,3754a5,Rugger11,9,Mon May 25 06:06:16 2015 UTC,"Oh my bad, you're completely right."
nyjets,3754a5,Axel3419,3,Mon May 25 06:13:36 2015 UTC,"SS/FS designations aren't entirely black/white anymore. Most teams run SS's similar to FS at this point. For all the people saying Weddle made Gilchrist play SS, they're not entirely right because Gilchrist still played his share of FS duties. He's got the experience doing it, but i don't know if that means he'll be particularly better than Pryor at it either."
nyjets,3754a5,NannigarCire,4,Mon May 25 05:42:27 2015 UTC,Oh fuck we don't know what we are doing save us please
nyjets,3754a5,mastodon6,5,Mon May 25 03:05:16 2015 UTC,"i get sass just because I don't understand what makes gilchrist a better fit for a FS than SS? He wasn't very popular as a SS, but that doesn't make him a good FS by default. i'm familiar with the basic traits necessary for a good free safety, but where has gilchrist proven he has those?"
nyjets,3754a5,viewless25,4,Mon May 25 04:13:36 2015 UTC,I didn't understand the attraction of Gilchrist by the Jets either.  He was a jack of all trades in the SD secondary and wasn't particularly great at any.  All I can think of is Bowles must see his skill set as a scheme fit.

Because that's not even close to true. I mean, forget Mo, there's at least 4 or 5 other guys I can think of right now who are due for significant pay considerations in the next two seasons..."
nyjets,373c7h,mikerhoa,5,Sun May 24 16:59:14 2015 UTC,"Every player is at OTAs except for Sheldon and Wilkerson, Wilkerson has a legit excuse for not attending because he is holding out for a contract, Sheldon has no excuse besides the workouts being voluntary. I'm not saying that I personally blame Sheldon for not attending, because again, they are voluntary. But when the rest of your team is there putting in work trying to get better to win, it doesn't look so good when you are the only one not there."
nyjets,373c7h,HaruSoul,3,Sun May 24 17:01:19 2015 UTC,"Okay, gotcha. I see what you mean."
nyjets,373c7h,mikerhoa,1 point,Sun May 24 17:02:56 2015 UTC,"Yes but I look at it from a different perspective.... it's like an optional event at work where literally all of the employees are attending with the exception of one or two who have legit reasons.  Not saying I know anything about life in the NFL, but do we see star players for the Patriots skipping OTAs? Sheldon and the rest of the squad have been off since DECEMBER! That's a long time to be off while making millions.... you have a new regime and new system in place, why not get as much time together with the new look squad as you can. I just don't feel like it's a championship attitude honestly. Mo I can understand with his contract issues; maybe it's just me, but I don't think it sets a good tone for the rest of the team."
nyjets,373c7h,achokshi,-1,Mon May 25 16:39:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but his attitude is troubling. I'm not bashing him, and he hasn't done anything to show a lack of character, but he's cultivating unnecessary problems with his mouth.

In the 4th quarter of the final game of the 2011 season against the Miami Dolphins, Holmes appeared to get into an argument with Jets offensive tackle Wayne Hunter while the team was huddling. As a result of the argument, Holmes was benched for the remainder of the game, and the Jets ended up losing the game, which resulted in the Jets missing the postseason for the first time in 3 years.

While Geno never quite reaches the ranks of elite QBs, he proves to be good enough to win with a good team around him as he makes some explosive plays while finally learning to minimize mistakes (think Eli Manning).   Won't: While our defense is really good (I can't envision a scenario where it isnt), Geno proves all his doubters right that he's been the problem this whole time, not just his lack of weapons. Fitzpatrick steps in and is competent, but not good enough to dig us out of the whole and we miss the playoffs again, or at best we sneak in but don't make it very far. Either way, it becomes clear we need a long term option, but won't do so badly that we can land a top guy in the draft so we have to do something like take a chance on someone's backup and have him compete with Petty."

nyjets,36zzze,LayzeeLar,2,Tue May 26 20:24:21 2015 UTC,"We have a new head coach and a new front office.  This often can lead to growing pains the first year.  On the plus side, we do not seem to be in a rebuilding mode, so I am not too worried about it.  Defensively, we are very strong.  We have a young defensive line that has the potential to be great.  We have a good, though unspectacular, linebacking corps.  We have a lauded defensive backfield, that while the corners are on the wrong side of 30, is still very talented.  Offensively, it's a mixed bag.  We have a good offensive line and receiving corps.  Our running backs are capable.  Our quarterbacks are mediocre on a good day.  Our lack of talent at quarterback are our Achilles heel.  The big question is if Geno Smith can achieve success and become a reliable quarterback.  He suffered being coached under a quarterback-career-killing coach in Rex Ryan.  We'll see if he's been permanently damaged, and if he ever had that much talent to begin with.  He's had flashes of good play, but he's been terribly inconsistent."
nyjets,36zzze,boomchakaboom,1 point,Sat May 23 19:20:00 2015 UTC,"Will:   The Defense shows that it's not only very good, but historically good and filled with players all over the field who can take over a game and have good depth waiting behind them. We get the shutdown corner play that we came to expect from our deep playoff runs except now it's also complemented by a fearsome defensive line that can't be simply schemed out of a game, and our linebackers and safeties get reign to creatively roam the field and wreak havoc as playmakers. This means that every offense that we verse will be forced to play a different game against us than anybody else in the league, a huge advantage towards our team.   The offense isn't a lights-show but it's filled with disciplined players who can move the ball down the field and are capable of physically dominating their opponent, especially in the red-zone, and we become the team that physically and mentally dominates it's opponents.  Won't:   The defense is still very good but doesn't quite gel as an elite unit, and it suffers from frequently being placed into bad positions due to mistakes on offense or special teams.  On offense there are times that serve as glimmers of hope for what could be reached but the over-arching story is that the unit doesn't have the consistency to even be an average unit and nobody really has confidence in them to become that. Our passing game becomes hand-cuffed and we find ourselves in a lot of battles where we wonder what could have been."

nyjets,36yw32,Mukuro-san,-2,Sat May 23 07:51:38 2015 UTC,"Because we as a fan base seriously overhype his ability. That's why he wants ridiculous money now. Even if you look at stats that are kind to players with low sack totals, he's rarely top 5 in any of them. Overall a very good player, but he's not a star. And this is coming from someone who loves him. He doesn't do much wrong, but he doesn't do much great. He's not a HoF player, he's a franchise player."

nyjets,36yw32,jrfoxe,2,Sat May 23 17:00:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's difficult to assess his ability because he plays against the best pass-blockers on opposing teams, and he gets double teamed or chip blocked more than anybody on our team. I don't believe a non-dominant player would receive as much game planning as he does, and he has to deal with our mediocre linebackers. Seriously, our LB core is underwhelming. For all the credit the front 7 receives, most of it needs to go to our 3 linemen. I also feel that people incorrectly compare Mo against both Sheldon and 4-3 DEs. I'd say Mo is exactly what you want in a 3-4 DE/DT, but $14 mil is a steep price to pay for any player that isn't a QB."

nyjets,36vrjl,HaruSoul,3,Fri May 22 14:41:56 2015 UTC,I think the best option is what this guy mentioned. Keep him happy this year with a designation prohibiting the Jets from tagging him next year and deal with it next offseason. We won't get trade value for him but it at least keeps him here for the year and let's us evaluate Williams and how necessary Mo is to our defense. The other option is to trade him for a phenomenal O-lineman or vet QB but that's a risky move because Williams is still unproven.
nyjets,36vrjl,Captain-Vimes,2,Fri May 22 21:10:45 2015 UTC,will always say this  unless they can somehow get a franchise vet qb like rivers do not get rid of him

This is not the Rex crusades anymore, the Jets need to become a more level headed franchise. If that means trading a player because you have two guys who are better and cheaper and get something in return, so be it"
nyjets,36vrjl,jrg114,2,Fri May 22 21:13:11 2015 UTC,"Did you just say that Williams is better and cheaper? Because that's ridiculous.  You can make a case for Richardson, but when all is said and done Mo has nothing left to prove. He's earned his money and starting job. It's up to the rookie to put in work and win favor. For some reason fans are looking at this backwards.  Mo belongs as the starter, and he should be payed as our best player because that's exactly what he is. The onus is on Williams to prove himself, and treating it any other way is putting the cart before the horse and doing a major disservice to one of the best players in recent Jet history.  People need top disrespecting Mo. They act like he should be punished for earning a big contract or some shit..."
nyjets,36vrjl,mikerhoa,1 point,Sat May 23 12:50:04 2015 UTC,"lol you're completely wrong and completely misunderstood what I was saying.  Let's get a couple things straight first...   Sheldon is better than MO and is cheaper I didn't say Leo is, I said he has the ability to be and is cheaper Sure he's earned his money, but what kind of money is that? He sure as hell isn't worth Suh or Watt money because news flash he's not Suh or Watt, but wants to be paid like them. I'm not saying we should give him away because we're better off without him. I'm saying if it's not the right price you have to be smart about it, being sentimental is not what wins championships. No ones disrespecting Mo, he's very very good, but the reality is that he is not top on the same level as Sheldon.  Leo might bust, or he just might be better than Mo. Also both Sheldon and Leo are much cheaper than any type of contract Mo could want Everyone with Mo's ability deserves a big contract. That's not the point at all. Should we really pay some 13-14 mil/year when we have 2 guys for cheaper and 1 is undeniably better and the other certainly has the potential to be.   It really depends on how Leo shows out in the next year or 2  Do we all love Mo and want him to stay and retire a Jet? Of course!  However signing players on emotion is not the business MacDaddy is in. He's here to give us the best possible team, if that means Leo is here for years and Mo gets traded for some nice extra pieces, then so be it."
nyjets,36vrjl,jrg114,1 point,Sat May 23 13:09:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand what ""completely"" means, because we're not that far away from each other on some points.  The one thing we absolutely disagree on is Sheldon being better. Not the case. I think Mo is better, but either way it's immaterial because they play two different positions and can be on the field at the same time. So there's that.  You and I do agree that Mo is worth a big contract. Should he get Watt or Suh dollars? I think he certainly could, but the Jets should aim a bit lower. That said, I think a 6 year deal at about $85-90 million with around $30 million guaranteed will get it done. Add on some restructuring ability on the back end and I think you have a very fair deal there.  You're not looking to the long term. Sheldon will command a deal that's just as big for 2017, and with Revis's monster contract (that everyone loves btw) we're going to have to make some hard choices. I truly believe that this team begins at its defensive line, and those are the guys you're gonna have to pay to stay in contention. So if we can keep this core together and work from there, it will give us our best chance to win. Bowles's successful teams have always had fearsome fronts and keeping this group together will give us just that.  That certainly makes more sense than betting on an unproven guy and risk having to go out and make a deal like the Dolphins just made when we had and elite young talent right here.  And you keep saying ""it's about emotion"" or some shit. It's not. You don't let elite players get away in the NFL. You just don't. We made that mistake with Revis and it cost us, now you want to do the same thing with Mo?"
nyjets,36vrjl,mikerhoa,1 point,Sat May 23 13:26:16 2015 UTC,"The thing is you're right we don't hugely disagree.  The one thing we disagree on, however completely changes the discussion.   Whether Wilk or Sheldon is better.  So the thing is I'm not betting on Leo. I said if Leo isn't good enough you absolutely sign Wilk like you would have before.   However I (and the public consensus) believe Sheldon is better.   So... IF Leonard shows enough in the next year or 2 (I'm not into franchising Wilk, but we'll see) to where Todd thinks he'll be as good if not better than Wilk for cheaper, there is no discussion. When someone is better, younger, and cheaper you don't stray away from them.  You're absolutely right, they'll have to make some tough choices. The thing is Sheldon is absolutely worth that huge deal in 2017 where as Mo probably isn't right now.   If we're looking to the future like that, what I see happening is Cro restructures his deal next year so he can stay, him and Revis are eventually replaced (hopefully by Dee and Dex). After the guarantee in his contract is up (or when his ability dips more) Revis moves to FS lives out his contract and retires. That young secondary could grow up to be really good if trained and developed correctly.  So, in this situation what would happen is our drafts for the future would be focused on OL, LB, and QB if neither Geno nor Bryce work out.   Our young guys there are Demario and Lorenzo (I really liked that pick, but more than just for his backstory I think he'll be really good).  The OL basically needs a complete rebuild b/c Nick and Brick aren't getting younger. I liked Mangolds backup Dalton Freeman in MIA, so we'll see with him down the road.   receiving wise I liked the DSmith pick but wasn't particularly in love with the pick. Jace Amaro to me is the real deal and will be really good.  Basically the point is we have a lot of young building blocks for he future as long as we continue to develop them. We need to be smart about this, If Wilk wants too much money, I'm sorry but you have to trade him. He's simply not as good as Suh or Watt"
nyjets,36vrjl,jrg114,1 point,Sat May 23 15:07:21 2015 UTC,How is Mo not on the same level as Sheldon?
nyjets,36vrjl,TheUnApolegist,2,Sat May 23 19:31:03 2015 UTC,He just isn't as good a pash rusher.  Literally look at every DE ranking from r/NFL or ESPN or the NFL network or the NFL top 100 or whatever you want he's just not.
nyjets,36vrjl,jrg114,1 point,Sat May 23 19:46:55 2015 UTC,"He does have to go up against the opposition's best pass blocker every game of the season. And he gets doubled, chipped, or peeled more often than any of our other players. I think that makes it difficult to assess how good he really is by just looking at his stats.

However I'm sure people do the same things to Watt and he still gets through pretty easily. When Mo is asking for Watt money he has to play like Watt and he's not Watt. Personally I think both Sheldon and Mo get a lot of attention so it would still be true that Sheldon is a better rusher, but it is harder to tell because they have to go against a unit as a unit rather than a WR or a CB"
nyjets,36vrjl,jrg114,1 point,Sat May 23 20:12:48 2015 UTC,Where have you heard Mo is asking for Watt money?
nyjets,36vrjl,jcinema48,1 point,Sun May 24 05:15:12 2015 UTC,"Watt is a lot more interesting because his athleticism is unparalleled by any big man in the game. The Texans actually have him line up all over the place to make it harder to game plan for him. I've seen him switch from LE to RE to DT within just 3 snaps, which I assume makes it much harder for coaches to make pre-snap adjustments. I definitely agree that Sheldon is a better pass rusher, but him and Mo have two different skill sets. I also don't think Sheldon would succeed as much if he had to switch sides, but he'd still be very good."

nyjets,36vrjl,HerroPhish,1 point,Sun May 24 04:05:36 2015 UTC,"We have him for around 7 million this year and can franchise him for a little over 15 million next year.  He's going to have to come down if he wants to get a contract done this off season. 5 years 60 million with 2 years and 31 million guaranteed sounds reasonable. If not, he can play lights out this year and show he is the most valuable jet defensive lineman, deserving of 14 million a year."
nyjets,36vrjl,ynksjts,0,Tue May 26 06:33:07 2015 UTC,"I still think he deserves a max extension.  He earned it. He's in his prime. We shouldn't be talking about anything else. Period.  It's up to Williams to prove his worth through the lean years now, and Coach Bowles already said he was gonna get his chance to show something even with Mo, Snacks, and Sheldon as the main event on the line. Treating him as a Mo's equal is absurd.  If Williams shines then we'll worry about it when his rookie deal is up. Until then pay Mo and be done with it already."

nyjets,36ua73,kalslaffin,50,Fri May 22 04:19:46 2015 UTC,Geno for DPOY
nyjets,36ua73,TreSeven,9,Fri May 22 04:51:09 2015 UTC,Geno can't hit free throws?
nyjets,36ua73,Sleepy_Man,18,Fri May 22 16:17:09 2015 UTC,You're comparing Apples to carrots
nyjets,36ua73,viewless25,2,Fri May 22 05:21:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If anything CP3 is the QB of the Clippers, not Jordan. And Jordan is an impending free agent while we're stuck with Geno for another couple of years..."
nyjets,36ua73,mikerhoa,5,Fri May 22 10:32:35 2015 UTC,You think if geno isn't good enough this year he'll start for us next year?
nyjets,36ua73,arv98s,1 point,Fri May 22 13:09:13 2015 UTC,who else will? he's our guy until (if) Petty is fully developed
nyjets,36ua73,viewless25,2,Fri May 22 13:46:22 2015 UTC,I guess I just disagree. If he has a bad year I don't think Mac or bowles will be inclined to start him. Mac will probably want to bring in a veteran until we draft someone good. Maybe Petty is that guy but I don't think so.   Hopefully Geno ends up being good and this doesn't matter.
nyjets,36ua73,arv98s,2,Fri May 22 13:55:33 2015 UTC,I'd like to see what our options are. I don't see any QB's in the 2016 class capable of being better than Geno right away and the FA and trade markets tend to disappoint.
nyjets,36ua73,viewless25,0,Fri May 22 14:56:06 2015 UTC,I was referring to the fact that he's signed through 2016 compared to Jordan's impending free agency...
nyjets,36ua73,mikerhoa,2,Fri May 22 13:12:36 2015 UTC,"Why is that a bad thing?  First off, Geno is only signed through next year. Second, he has a combined (2015 + 2016 season) cap hit of ~3M. In fact, if the Jets cut him next offseason, they save ~500,000.  So what's wrong with being ""stuck"" with Geno? My glasses may be a bit homer tinted, but holy fuck you'd think he banged everyone's SO's on this sub and then took a dump on them."
nyjets,36ua73,jcinema48,1 point,Fri May 22 14:12:52 2015 UTC,Gotcha. I know he's signed with us for the next few years I just don't think he'll get to play again if he sucks this year
nyjets,36ua73,arv98s,6,Fri May 22 13:53:23 2015 UTC,You win. I'm completely convinced with the decision of Geno being the starter for this season.
nyjets,36ua73,enjoyyoself,5,Fri May 22 05:58:45 2015 UTC,"Great analogy. Also, Jace Amaro is basically JJ Reddick when you really think about it."
nyjets,36ua73,jrfoxe,2,Fri May 22 17:20:31 2015 UTC,So we gotta keep Geno away from free throws?
nyjets,36ua73,GV22,2,Fri May 22 17:58:13 2015 UTC,Let's take a step back and look at what we're talking about: Geno - QB for the jets the last 2 seasons who the entire team knows and wants to believe can get the job done vs. Fitzpatrick who is a newcomer who still has to develop a rapport with the team and has yet to play a single game with them. The rest of the QBs aren't an option after the players meet with the new head coach and tell them they their thoughts on Geno (which had to have been positive considering the decision). If they didn't want Geno they would've said it.   I also agree with OP and the previous comments that this is where Geno makes or breaks his career as a starter. There have been excuses for him in the past but there are none now. If he be the Harriet Winslow to this family matters cast then he's gonna get REPLACED.
nyjets,36ua73,AxelFoley4,3,Sat May 23 01:13:50 2015 UTC,"I consider Geno Smith = Wilmer Flores as a more apt comparison.  Crappy player in important position on the NY franchise that I love who has a lot of detractors but also a lot of loyal defenders. Every time Geno throws a TD or Wilmer homers I cringe, because I know it means he's gonna stick around and continue to drag us down because it gives the appearance that he's cheap, young, and ""has potential.""  Both need to hit the road and be replaced IMO..."
nyjets,36ua73,mikerhoa,2,Fri May 22 10:34:01 2015 UTC,It would be a lot harder for the Jets to get a better Qb than it would be for the mets to get a better ss though. The mets are just cheapskates.

nyjets,36r9d6,joekuze,20,Thu May 21 14:17:00 2015 UTC,"The obvious -  Revis / Cro / Skrine  If anyone thinks Dee Milliner is getting cut you're smoking some good shit.  Dude was a physical freak coming out of college, and if he comes back to 90% of what he was, he will be a beast.   I think McDougle will be a surprise this year. and we keep Williams over Walls,  because he looked pretty good last year getting thrown into the fire.   Honestly I thought Mac went overboard with all the CB signings. We'll have guys that should be playing, riding the bench, and be bare at other spots like OL."
nyjets,36r9d6,editnonameedit,10,Thu May 21 16:08:43 2015 UTC,"Mac Daddy offered to make Mike Iupati the highest paid guard in the NFL, but he declined. Outside of Iupati there weren't many OL options in free agency."
nyjets,36r9d6,brad_smiths_shoe,5,Thu May 21 22:11:22 2015 UTC,"Yup, that was one of the guys I was thinking about.  He's gone now, but I thought overpaying for a guy like him instead of a slot guy like Skrine was the move.  I know he wanted to play closer to home though."
nyjets,36r9d6,editnonameedit,3,Thu May 21 22:22:18 2015 UTC,"I agree man, OL and QB are really the only positions I'm concerned about. Skrine was our first signing though, so it likely would have been Cro and/or Gilchrist that we wouldn't have signed.   I would have loved to taken OL higher in the draft, but BPA means BPA and I'm happy with our picks."
nyjets,36r9d6,brad_smiths_shoe,1 point,Thu May 21 22:57:43 2015 UTC,wasn't there recently a story about Devon Smith (is that his name) switching to OL?
nyjets,36r9d6,ZeboTheClown,4,Fri May 22 00:11:07 2015 UTC,"I think (hopefully) you are talking about Deon Simon, the DT we drafted in the 7th.  Devin Smith is the WR we drafted in the 2nd and would make a awful OG."
nyjets,36r9d6,troddle,3,Sat May 23 05:28:06 2015 UTC,Lol yes. The initials fuck me up
nyjets,36r9d6,ZeboTheClown,5,Sat May 23 11:02:50 2015 UTC,"I actually think it was smart to stack up at CB. We have immediate replacements with Revis, Cromartie, and Skrine. But even though we've invested a lot of money into these guys, Cromartie is curable after this year and Skrine after 2 years. Given that Cromartie and Revis are 30+, we need young talent to develop for the future and Milliner and McDougle are exactly that. You can never have too many solid CBs given the state of the new era passing attacks in today's nfl."
nyjets,36r9d6,sneakyfrankie,2,Thu May 21 18:28:52 2015 UTC,"No doubt, I agree with that.  If you have the luxury to load up with talent at certain positions, do it.    But the reality with the NFL, with the hard salary cap, is that you have to be smart and spread that money around.   My point was that we could have starting level talent watching from the sideline while we're being beat on the field at other positions we could have fortified."
nyjets,36r9d6,editnonameedit,2,Thu May 21 18:48:44 2015 UTC,"There is going to be 3 CB's on the field a majority of the time. Then you have Milliner, who has quite the injury history and Mcdougle, who missed all last year and has not played a snap in the NFL.  The way you make it sound is like we have durable, proven starters riding the bench which simply is not true. One injury at CB and every one of those guys will be playing. They will all probably get some time even if everyone stays healthy."
nyjets,36r9d6,games456,2,Thu May 21 19:12:50 2015 UTC,"Again, great points and very valid concerns.   Playing GM from my couch I would've prioritized the OL, and taken the talent already on the roster and hoped they'd fill the slot and backup CB needs.  You may very well be correct that stocking up on CB is the bigger need for us.  But I'm just looking at teams that have maulers on the OL and have done well.  Especially looking at teams in our division that have big time talent on the DL, like the Dolphins and Bills."
nyjets,36r9d6,editnonameedit,1 point,Thu May 21 20:06:32 2015 UTC,The thing is though nothing we did at CB affected what we did with our o-line. We could have signed another lineman or we could have drafted one if we wanted. They chose not to but I still don't see what that has to do with our CB's

nyjets,36r9d6,ThreeCranes,3,Thu May 21 15:23:40 2015 UTC,"Revis, Cro, Buster, Dee, and McDougle are all locks."
nyjets,36r9d6,Rugger11,3,Thu May 21 17:02:59 2015 UTC,Well we already know the 4 that are going to make it but i also hope we make room for Marcus Williams and Walls cause they both have potential to be starters and in case of injuries they will be great replacements
nyjets,36r9d6,Wumbo52,2,Thu May 21 16:36:12 2015 UTC,Walls doesn't. He's been around a few years and hasn't shown starter potential. He can go. Williams should get a spot tho
nyjets,36r9d6,woodchips24,1 point,Fri May 22 02:11:11 2015 UTC,He's young and can play man cov but he does have brick for hands so I would keep him around since he's more reliable than a lot of free agent DBs. Also having 6 or 7 corners just feels safe. I would rather cut some WRs or a RB than a CB
nyjets,36r9d6,Wumbo52,3,Fri May 22 02:40:28 2015 UTC,We will probably trade Walls as CB is always a premium
nyjets,36r9d6,Grgy,2,Thu May 21 16:48:12 2015 UTC,"Revis, Cro, Skrine, Milliner, Mcdougle unless Mcdougle is terrible."
nyjets,36r9d6,games456,2,Thu May 21 14:38:13 2015 UTC,"Besides the obvious of Revis, Cro, and Skrine; I think we keep Milliner because he showed flashes of being serviceable if he's not always injured. And honestly I think we keep walls as a 5th. He wasn't that good at all last year but he did make plays sometimes, and even if we did keep him he wouldn't be used that much."
nyjets,36r9d6,Urethra2Xtreme,5,Thu May 21 14:40:25 2015 UTC,I thought williams looked better than walls last year
nyjets,36piha,Redd-It-Here,44,Thu May 21 02:25:05 2015 UTC,"/r/patriots is a disgrace right now, and that's coming from a Pats fan. I think these comments are mild at most. He's basically just saying they got punished because the NFL felt they were worthy of being punished and are being treated as repeat offenders. Nothing he said was outlandish. And in typical /r/patriots fashion they are going on a witch hunt for Revis. I personally love the guy still and thank him for all he did in his 1 year here. No hard feelings."
nyjets,36piha,I_Enjoy_Taffy,18,Thu May 21 02:50:29 2015 UTC,"Damn you guys are angry. What I don't get though is why they think Revis was ever loyal to them.

Does that sort of thing happen a lot over there"

nyjets,36piha,JohnnyVNCR,0,Thu May 21 18:08:32 2015 UTC,"They've actually adopted an even worse excuse.  Since Goodell doesn't have video of Brady directing the cheating, the Patriots can't be punished.

Instead, they're acting like Cleveland fans after ""The Decision (to a smaller degree, obviously).   Good luck dealing with your fellow fans, especially if the Pats get off to a slow start.

Personally, as neither a fan of the Pats and Goodell, I'd prefer they keep their fight between themselves and not drag us into it at every opportunity they can find.

Everyone else see that. JETS FANS ARE APPLAUDING THE COMMENTS BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR THAT'S WHAT HE DID.   (The Patriots) have a history of doing stuff. You can't hide that … Tom was there when they did that stuff in the past.   So Spygate is on Brady even though he had no involvement with it? Does that mean Revis is in some way culpable for Deflategate because he was ""there"" when we did that ""stuff""?   New England's been doing stuff in the past and getting in trouble. When stuff repeatedly happens, then that's it. I don't know what else to tell you. Stuff repeatedly happened through the years. You got SpyGate, you got this and that and everything else. Obviously in those situations in the past, they had the evidence. So they did what they needed to do.   He's clearly suggesting that the Patriots are a long-time cheating institution who have been proven to cheat continuously over the years. When we're talking about filming from the wrong spot on the field and a maximum of 0.4 psi deflation (and that only if we ignore Walt Anderson's own recollection), separated by 8 years.  If I were a Jets fan, I'd probably celebrate these comments precisely because they are EXACTLY what people with basic reading comprehension on /r/patriots and every sports news outlet in the world can plainly see.  If these comments are so innocuous, then you must believe that Belichick and Brady are reading them today nodding along and thinking nothing of them.  You've been all over the place trying to refute the obvious. Just shut the hell up."

nyjets,36r3q2,jetsfan07,4,Thu May 21 19:15:18 2015 UTC,I was wondering if he was doing it out of solidarity for Mo. They've trained together and seem pretty tight.   As far as the Money goes. The reason Mo is put in such a precarious position is Richardson's emergence. I don't think him skipping workouts has much to do with him feeling he isn't going to get paid.
nyjets,36r3q2,games456,1 point,Thu May 21 15:18:36 2015 UTC,"This. It's more likely Richardson isn't showing up for Wilkerson, than some conspiracy theory that we don't value our second best player"

Mo is a hold out for obvious reasons but some of these guy got shit they want to do so they do it.  If you are someone fighting for a roster spot than yea, missing voluntary ota's might be a bad idea but I do not think Richardson is worried about losing his spot."

nyjets,36iu4p,SpygateHernandez,2,Wed May 20 03:07:10 2015 UTC,"Ranked #81, 2013 season.   There was a lot of expectations on the rookie Richardson and with 906 snaps the Jets weren’t easing him into anything. While his pass rushing production was at times not reflective of how much he was on the field, you can’t say the same with his work in the run game. His nonstop motor and relentless pursuit of plays saw him finish with the second highest run defense grade at his position. A fine start to a career and if he can improve his pass rushing then a higher ranking in future years is to be expected.  Best Performance: Week 13, MIA @ NYJ, +4.0  Key Stat: His 41 defensive stops were second-most of all 3-4 defensive ends.   Ranked #15, 2014 season.   Richardson had a fantastic rookie year, but he didn’t do enough rushing the passer to convince of his elite merits. Well, his sophomore season was something different, where he was fantastic rushing the passer. His +24.7 grade was second best of all 3-4 defensive ends and, coupled with his outstanding run defense, propelled him to a comfortable second overall grade of all interior defenders. There are no doubts about Richardson now.  Best Performance: Week 14, NYJ @ MIN, +6.6  Key Stat: Graded positively in all but one contest, and never graded worse than a -1.0 in any facet of the game."

It was not a memorandum on banning video taping, it was a memorandum banning video taping from ""...the coaches’ booth, on the field, or in the locker room during the game"" whereas video taping from anywhere else was legal. If you're going to harp on stealing signals being a big deal even though coaches expect it, you better get it fucking right.

What a joke. Brady flat out said he not was familiar with a rule that he fucking got implemented.  The sideline is part of the field. They knew what they were doing was illegal.

nyjets,36kttn,R4TSO,11,Wed May 20 03:03:14 2015 UTC,"In a series of articles over the next few days, Football Outsiders will be looking division-by-division at the biggest weakness left on each team's roster after free agency and the 2015 NFL draft.  This edition examines the AFC East.  Buffalo Bills  Biggest post-draft weakness: Quarterback  In five seasons with the Jets, Rex Ryan never had a quarterback who ranked higher than 28th according to Football Outsiders' DVOA ratings. (DVOA, or defense-adjusted value over average, is explained further here.) Now he comes to a team with a third-year quarterback (EJ Manuel) who ranked 37th and 38th in his first two seasons, and a veteran quarterback (Matt Cassel) who has been just as bad in four of his past six seasons. Regardless of how much blame Ryan deserves for Mark Sanchez's failure to develop in New York, he has even less to work with at the position right now in Buffalo.  Ryan's Bills mirror recent Buffalo teams, just in a more exaggerated way. During the Bills' 15-year playoff drought, they have had many good defenses; seven times, they have had a top-10 defense by DVOA. But never during that stretch have they had a top-10 offense, and their quarterbacks have been the worst in the NFL. Since 2001, the Bills have had no quarterback rank better than 20th in DVOA.  In 2014, the Bills' quarterback weakness kept the league's second-best defense (by DVOA) out of the playoffs. This year, the Bills actually have an even bigger hole at quarterback. For most of 2014, the Bills started a quarterback in Kyle Orton who averaged being the 22nd-best quarterback in the NFL by DVOA over his last five seasons with at least 100 attempts. By comparison, Cassel has been the 30th-best quarterback over his last five qualifying seasons, and Manuel has been even worse so far in his short career. The Bills' quarterback situation gives the rest of the team little margin for error in 2015.  Miami Dolphins  Biggest post-draft weakness: Cornerback  Top corner Brent Grimes may already be in decline. In 2013, Miami ranked seventh in the NFL against opponents' top receivers. Last season, Miami fell to 21st in that category as part of the Dolphins' second-half defensive swoon. Improvement in 2015 is unlikely. Grimes will turn 32 in July, an age past which very few corners sustain a high level of play. It is certainly in play for Grimes to have his falling-off-a-cliff season. It has happened somewhere around his age for almost every cornerback not named Darrell Green. While the Dolphins have been in decent shape at the top corner position with Grimes in recent seasons, they may be in trouble as early as this season.  Of even greater concern for the Dolphins is depth at corner. Getting little from 2013 second-rounder Jamar Taylor and 2014 fourth-rounder Walt Aikens, the Dolphins ranked 30th in the league last year against opponents' third, fourth, and fifth wideouts. Entering the offseason with just Grimes, Taylor and Aikens on the cornerback depth chart, Miami has taken two paths to try to address its weaknesses.  First, they dipped at the low end of the free-agent market, signing Brice McCain and Zack Bowman. Neither player is particularly young (McCain is 28, Bowman 30), and neither has provided much value above replacement level in recent years. In the draft, they waited until the fifth round to add two corners, Bobby McCain and Tony Lippett (the latter of whom primarily played wide receiver in college). While they have cornered the market for McCains in the NFL (with linebacker Chris, the Dolphins currently have every McCain to play since 1950), the Dolphins have not filled their hole at corner so much as papered it over by acquiring low-level veterans and mid-round picks.  After addressing their receiver weakness with the smart trade for Kenny Stills, the Dolphins might have been better off using their first-round pick to address their hole at corner instead of selecting Louisville WR DeVante Parker. Instead, Miami's pass defense will depend on Grimes holding up for another year and a breakout from one of their unproven players.  New York Jets  Biggest post-draft weakness: Quarterback  All the improvements that the Jets have made this offseason are window dressing until they find a quarterback. Even after just two seasons, the chances that Geno Smith is the guy are small. In those seasons, Smith ranked 40th and 31st, respectively, in DVOA. Over the past 25 years, here are the 10 quarterbacks whose DVOA ratings in their first two seasons with at least 100 attempts came closest to Smith's numbers.  QBs Most Similar To Geno Smith By DVOA In First Two Years, 1989-2014  PLAYER  YEARS   Y1 DVOA Y1 RANK Y2 DVOA Y2 RANK  Geno Smith  2013-2014   -23.6%  40  -12.5%  31  Kyle Boller 2003-2004   -26.0%  41  -14.6%  28  Jake Locker 2012-2013*  -23.6%  32  -5.7%   22  Tim Couch   1999-2000   -28.4%  44  -15.1%  34  Rick Mirer  1993-1994   -15.7%  33  -12.5%  34  Joey Harrington 2002-2003   -20.9%  42  -18.2%  39  Trent Dilfer    1994-1995   -31.0%  38  -11.3%  34  Charlie Frye    2005-2006   -21.4%  36  -18.9%  37  Billy Joe Tolliver  1989-1990   -21.4%  36  -5.9%   21  Steve Walsh 1989-1990   -20.6%  35  -5.9%   22  Jake Plummer    1997-1998   -17.7%  38  -8.4%   29  Locker was a rookie in 2011; these are his first two seasons with 100 attempts. While these and most examples of similar quarterbacks do not look good, there are a couple of counterexamples Jets fans could look to. Troy Aikman struggled his first two seasons even more than Smith, and if we look back before DVOA ratings (which start in 1989), so did Terry Bradshaw. Unlike Smith, however, scouts saw enough potential in Aikman and Bradshaw to make each of them the No. 1 overall pick. Lacking that pedigree, Smith's early-career struggles have been bad enough to make him a very poor bet to break out. Ryan Fitzpatrick does not exactly fill the Jets' hole at quarterback, but he is likely to be the better short-term option.  New England Patriots  Biggest post-draft weakness: Cornerback  After losing Darrelle Revis and Brandon Browner in free agency, the Patriots appeared likely to take a corner early in the draft. Instead, perhaps scared off by the ghosts of Ras-I Dowling and Terrence Wheatley, Bill Belichick waited until the seventh round to draft a corner. The Patriots now have Bradley Fletcher, signed from the Eagles in free agency, as their No. 1 cornerback.  If all you know of Fletcher are 2014 lowlights like this and this, then this sounds like an untenable situation. It's not quite as bad as it seems. No cornerback in football gets a bigger boost in his numbers when we account for the opposing receivers he had to face. If we adjust for Fletcher's schedule -- including five games lining up across from Dez Bryant (fifth in receiving DVOA), DeSean Jackson (sixth), and Jordy Nelson (eighth) -- Fletcher actually ranked 36th in adjusted success rate, making Fletcher an above-average corner. He is also an excellent value at the price the Patriots paid for him.  The fact that Fletcher is underrated and came at a bargain rate would make him an excellent No. 2 corner. He's still not a desirable option as your team's top corner. Even adjusting for opposition, the Eagles were still just 24th against opponents' top wideouts in 2014. Perhaps the only other potential choice on the roster is Super Bowl hero Malcolm Butler, and then only because his small sample size as a rookie leaves his ceiling undefined. Barring a midseason trade like the one that brought Aqib Talib to Foxborough in 2012, the Patriots will most likely have to scheme around lacking a true top cover corner."
nyjets,36kttn,NRA4eva,6,Wed May 20 14:46:41 2015 UTC,"Judging by the image that goes with the article, I'll bet Geno is our weakness."
nyjets,36kttn,viewless25,-3,Wed May 20 03:17:55 2015 UTC,Hard to be a weakness when you're the 2nd string QB.
nyjets,36kttn,John_YJKR,4,Wed May 20 06:10:00 2015 UTC,Its his job to lose
nyjets,36kttn,_vsrs_,1 point,Wed May 20 09:39:37 2015 UTC,It's no ones job right now. It belongs to whoever performs best in camp. Who played several seasons in this offense and had a better 2014? Who is inconsistent and goes through progressions too slow? Fitz is already back in the weight room. The leg is healing nicely. He will be ready come July. It'd be great if Geno suddenly became good. I'd root for him and be very pleased. A young QB who does not suck? Who wouldn't want that? But it's more likely geno's play will only marginally improve going forward. I don't believe our future QB is on the team yet.
nyjets,36kttn,John_YJKR,10,Wed May 20 10:14:13 2015 UTC,But it's still his job right now...
nyjets,36kttn,_vsrs_,-2,Wed May 20 10:51:20 2015 UTC,"By default yes. But does that mean anything for the upcoming season at all? No. When making projections about who the jets starting QB will be, why are we ignoring the most likely candidate because of who the starting QB was last season? It's not last season. It's this season. And the job will go to the best QB on the team. This isn't hard to wrap your head around. Fitz is hands down superior to Geno. Yes, there exists a small chance that Geno gets it and suddenly processes the game faster. But the odds are we get more of the same or a slight improvement. Not good enough."
nyjets,36kttn,John_YJKR,5,Wed May 20 11:43:56 2015 UTC,Because the coach has said Geno will open camp as the starter.
nyjets,36kttn,danomite555,0,Wed May 20 14:22:33 2015 UTC,But that doesn't matter if the real status of the QB position is TBD. They have to give someone the first team reps. Fitz is injured so naturally Geno gets them. But it makes sense he'd get the bulk regardless because he needs to get used to the system. Fitz is smart and spent multiple seasons in that system. So he'd only need reps to build chemistry with the wr's. This gives Geno every opportunity and no excuses not to beat Fitz in camp. Honestly I like the approach by Bowles because it's making sure they do their due diligence by seeing if Geno can be the starter his potential suggests. In the end Geno would have to improve a lot in one off season to be as good as Fitz. And Fitz is by no means an amazing QB but he's coming off solid season and he's only 32. Not crazy old. He's the perfect age to let a QB develop behind him. We aren't in rebuilding mode anymore. So we will start the best QB currently all potential aside. That's Fitz. Bottom line is people need to stop assuming Geno is the starter game 1 because that's not even the most likely scenario. How do you make a proper assessment of the upcoming season if you ignore the most likely QB to start?
nyjets,36kttn,John_YJKR,1 point,Wed May 20 15:17:19 2015 UTC,not sure why you're being downvoted. geno could very easily be our backup for the majority of the season.
nyjets,36kttn,laser-TITS,1 point,Wed May 20 15:44:40 2015 UTC,Probably b/c the article would be the exact same if Fitz was already announced as starter.  Its definitely not rocket surgery that the Jets and Bills weaknesses are QB related lol

nyjets,36iwhj,NotAModBro,2,Wed May 20 18:24:33 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that if you're innocent you don't take that huge hit of the 1'st and 4'th.  Draft picks are the only way to improve your team in terms of affordable top level talent and it's an enormous loss to a team.    The Patriots answer to the Wells report was just media PR by trying to raise doubt, but nobody but Pats fans took it seriously.  Deflate, seriously LOL.  Way back when the Patriots refused to let the main player in the investigation (McNally) be interviewed again Kraft and Co were basically pulling the plug and admitting they were caught."
nyjets,36iwhj,editnonameedit,1 point,Tue May 19 19:21:55 2015 UTC,that seems like a really bad decision on Kraft and the Pats organization. they could still make the playoffs even if they go 1-3 the first few games. the draft picks could hurt for the next few years
nyjets,36iwhj,ocyries,19,Tue May 19 19:33:14 2015 UTC,"Conceptually, it's similar to apologizing to someone because of how they took something you said, not apologizing for what you said.

nyjets,36iwhj,mdico91,5,Tue May 19 18:53:28 2015 UTC,"It is against the CBA to fight it. Also Kraft broke the rules by showing he was pissed publicly. If you have an issue with the NFL as an owner you have to bring it up to them, not the public. He would get in trouble for both."

Once Kraft realized none of the other owners had his back, he figured it wasn't a fight worth fighting. I.e., he figured he was going to lose the fight.   I'm a New England fan, and completely confused by the whole damn thing. If your organization and QB are truly innocent, why the fuck wouldn't you fight it? I simply don't get it."
nyjets,36iwhj,SpygateHernandez,2,Wed May 20 11:24:08 2015 UTC,"They couldn't have his back. CBA rules, say that if an owner has an issue with the NFL he can not make that issue public. Same goes for ""having another owners back"". It just doesn't look good for the NFL so that's why. The NFL rule doesn't state you cant appeal it as an owner, just the CBA. Also in the CBA is that an owner CAN NOT appeal. These are CBA rules not NFL. An since the CBA is a contract, it has to be upheld. So even if Kraft wants to appeal this, he can not. If he did they would come down on him for talking about his displeasure with the NFL."

nyjets,36jb52,CrimsonToaster,2,Tue May 19 21:02:12 2015 UTC,16th ranked qb last season. Behind Alex Smith. Brilliant move locking that up.

nyjets,36jb52,NotAModBro,0,Tue May 19 21:57:12 2015 UTC,By what metric? Tannehill has had three years in this league and has gotten better with each successive season. He is easily a top 15 QB and will probably be top 10 after this upcoming year. A top 10 QB for $16m/year is an incredible deal. I would kill for the Jets to have that.

nyjets,36ka74,Realistik84,0,Wed May 20 13:40:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried. I actually don't want to sign him, on the assumption Mo wants more than $12m/year and a $30-40m guarantee. I want to trade him for a 1st (or better yet, a 1st-round O-line talent) if possible. It's not that I don't love him -- I do. Nor that I think we don't have the money -- we probably do. It's that I think we need to shift resources a bit to help the O-line. I thought that before the draft. I think that even more now that we got Big Cat."

nyjets,36ka74,John_YJKR,1 point,Wed May 20 15:14:40 2015 UTC,Speaking of crazy tho. Geno?!
nyjets,36ka74,Itsascrnnam,2,Wed May 20 15:15:34 2015 UTC,What about him?
nyjets,36ka74,blinkme123,1 point,Wed May 20 15:18:22 2015 UTC,You still believe in him? I'm onto Fitz under Chan's system as a hopefully passable stopgap. I've given up on Geno. Took me years to give up on Sanchez. I have little faith left for Geno.
nyjets,36ka74,wishistudiedphysics,2,Wed May 20 15:26:36 2015 UTC,"The problem is that Fitz isn't exactly leagues ahead of Geno. Geno is still young and if this new offense can help him turn things around, he has the higher ceiling. Fitz played under Chan's system in Buffalo, and he wasn't exactly lights out. In fact there's a reason that neigh of them kept their jobs. Yes, Fitz is better than last year's Geno. But until we go through camp and some preseason games we don't know if we have last year's Geno still."
nyjets,36ka74,jcinema48,1 point,Wed May 20 16:10:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed. No way to tell right now. Especially with Fitz recovering from injury. But the one thing that sways me is this: Fitz has a very quick release. That can make all the difference in a spread system, especially when your oline is suspect as ours is. Geno, on the other hand, is painfully slow, as much due to fearful/bad decision-making as mechanics."
nyjets,36ka74,ThreeCranes,1 point,Wed May 20 16:36:21 2015 UTC,Haha. I'm constantly getting into arguments here since we acquired Fitz. I've been saying he's definitely the starter game 1. Makes people mad. They aren't ready to accept what we know already.
nyjets,36ka74,Redd-It-Here,1 point,Wed May 20 15:41:37 2015 UTC,"Well, we don't really know it -- chiefly in my mind because of the uncertainty of his injury recovery -- but yeah I'm with you. Fitz did well with Chan and got a big contract with the Bills before flaming out. He was consistently average or better last year before his injury, if I recall correctly. He's got a fast release. Aside from a game here or there, Geno has shown nothing but league-bottom performance. And his release/decision-making is soooo slow, a killer especially when your O-line is porous. And he loooves to run backwards away from pressure. I had faith in Geno at first. But my willingness to keep the faith with rookie QBs who suck after a year or two died with Sanchez, who I believed in waaaay too long."
nyjets,36ka74,xenonprime,2,Wed May 20 16:42:18 2015 UTC,"So we trade him to get a first round pick. What do you want out of a first round pick? Someone of Wilk's talent level is the ideal outcome. But only until we have to pay them what they are worth? Seems pointless to me. When you have the money, which we do, you keep good players on the team. Everyone is always preaching to ""build through the draft"", that only works if you keep the great players you find in the draft. Good teams don't trade away their stars, desperate ones do."
nyjets,36ka74,NYJETSfaninNE,2,Wed May 20 16:07:24 2015 UTC,"My view is good teams don't follow simplistic rules, they do what's best for each situation. You discount the timing issue. Timing is rather important in terms of who gets paid what. There's a reason successful rookies are so valuable -- not just because they contribute but because they are very cheap for 3 to 4 years. What I want above all is to build up our O-line. That's the glaring weakness that could sink this team, no matter how good the D (and it should/will be very good, with or without Mo). With a reasonably good O-line, we are a playoff team with hopes. With our current bad-to-mediocre O-line, all bets are off. This is assuming we can get consistently mediocre QB play of course. If we get bad QB play, it won't matter."
nyjets,36ka74,NYJETSfaninNE,1 point,Wed May 20 16:39:15 2015 UTC,It's not that it's non-news or meant nothing. It definitely means something. But the chances are that the situation is much further from coming to a head than the media is portraying and many fans are anticipating.

All we hear is how,much better their D-line is and how it's ""not even close"". I'm so sick of that narrative. Give me Mo and Sheldon over any three of their DL any day.  Bills fans are quickly approaching Pat fan level for me. At least when it comes to insanity/delusion. They have one mediocre season, don't even make the playoffs, and feel it's ok to act cocky af. I mean, I think the Bills are good, but more than 8-8 good? No way. That D-line is all they have and it's older and worse than ours. Their QB situation is worse. Their line is way worse. Their secondary is worse. How is Shady gonna run when he's hurt more than he's healthy? Shady couldn't flourish in Chip's offense, a perfect offense for McCoy, and now he's supposed to perform against three of the best run defending teams in football 6 times with that poor excuse of an offensive line? Getting Rex was a good move and it's definitely got nothing to do with my hate. But that cockiness he brought is unwarranted. At least he took us to two AFC Championship games with some of the bigger upsets in the playoffs. If the Bills are anything remotely decent this year, I'll eat crow but I KNOW that's not gonna happen. Can't wait for the season to begin."
nyjets,36diiv,the_furry_stoner,4,Mon May 18 21:37:07 2015 UTC,It'll be interesting if Leonard Williams lines up in front of Brandon Scherff when we play you in Week 10
nyjets,36diiv,the_furry_stoner,4,Mon May 18 22:18:41 2015 UTC,He'll be all over the place. That D line has 3 players that can line up anywhere. They're a scary squad.
nyjets,36diiv,Shrimpola_Cola,2,Mon May 18 22:23:09 2015 UTC,Right now the Bills are the most overrated team.  They could very easily get swept by the Jets and the Dolphins.

nyjets,36diiv,the_furry_stoner,1 point,Tue May 19 01:43:35 2015 UTC,"Best O-line in the league so that's no excuse. He isn't hurt as often as I previously thought but it feels like he always has something minor. When does that minor tweak turn into something serious, especially when he'll be getting hit much more. Rex likes to run up the middle and that line can't block. Plus McCoy has the 8th most carries among active RBs despite being at least two years younger than anyone around him on the list. He may be fairly young but he's taken more snaps and carries than a lot of RBs and that takes a toll."
nyjets,36diiv,wcstyles,1 point,Tue May 19 01:52:42 2015 UTC,"It wasnt the best o line when everyone was hurt, put down the pipe. McCoy is one year removed from the lead rushing title. He isnt old or washed up or often injured. He is a great fucking football player that we would fear greatly if our D-line wasn't the best in the league."
nyjets,36diiv,the_furry_stoner,1 point,Tue May 19 02:32:50 2015 UTC,"Of course it wasn't the best O-line when everyone was hurt. But it ended up being #1 or #2 according to PFF. More than anything I'm saying he may struggle behind an inferior line like the Bills. Clearly he's much worse with a worse O-line. He's going from #2 to #30 and from a very creative coach in Chip Kelly to a very non-creative coach in Rex Ryan. That combined with him splitting carries with Jackson makes me fear him significantly less. I already admitted I was wrong about the injuries, but he always has a minor one. Knees and ankles add up, especially when you rush as much as he does."

nyjets,36dtfm,BigNuke43,12,Mon May 18 20:13:06 2015 UTC,"Stretching the field, probably on a fair share of post routes.

Having a true deep threat should mean they have to commit men a bit further back and hopefully loosen up the rest of the field.
nyjets,36dtfm,nukacola26,1 point,Mon May 18 16:48:21 2015 UTC,"I think thats more important than anything else. Opening up the offence, stretching the defence, and giving marshall and decker room to play. He can take it to the next level once we really need him."
nyjets,36dtfm,BigNuke43,6,Mon May 18 23:53:39 2015 UTC,I unrealistically expect 600 yards and 7 touchdowns. Fuck being realistic
nyjets,36dtfm,Superjam83,3,Mon May 18 17:32:19 2015 UTC,"Gonna say 650 yards, 5 TDs. Hell if I know, though."
nyjets,36dtfm,anon5848,3,Mon May 18 17:10:03 2015 UTC,30 catches with a 15+ YPC average. Big plays.
nyjets,36dtfm,Btk88,2,Mon May 18 19:32:07 2015 UTC,600 Yards 4 TD hopefully   his roll in this offense will be the same as the one he had at Ohio State and hes trying to develop more skills which I think he is
nyjets,36dtfm,JASPriest,2,Mon May 18 23:40:03 2015 UTC,does anyone see him as a chance to be kickoff and/or punt returner
nyjets,36dtfm,Pyrollamas,2,Tue May 19 03:46:51 2015 UTC,I expect the Jets to win every game Smith catches a TD. Ohio State won every game Devin Smith caught a TD in.
nyjets,36dtfm,GreatOdinsRaven_,2,Tue May 19 11:02:58 2015 UTC,"Nm like 1800 yards, 18 TDs total.  That includes playoff & SB totals tho so no worries"

nyjets,36b6nr,anon5848,3,Sun May 17 23:28:53 2015 UTC,Would but Jones in the LB core and Evans at the WR core Owusu cut  also see Graham making it
nyjets,36b6nr,Ottorange,9,Mon May 18 02:47:13 2015 UTC,"As a 'Cuse fan and a Jets fan I really hope Daryl Eskridge can find a spot for himself. He is a real athlete and has been a blast to watch at the college level. He is a hard hitter who could make a name for himself in special teams at the very least. I was very suprised he did not get drafted, most people thought he was going around the 5th round."
nyjets,36b6nr,TreSeven,8,Mon May 18 00:12:11 2015 UTC,I actually came here to make a bold prediction of him making the final roster. He was maybe our best value pick in the draft in my opinion
nyjets,36b6nr,viewless25,6,Mon May 18 00:19:26 2015 UTC,"This was pretty good. I would also expect a few more young players on the PS such as Trevor Reilly, JC Copeland, and Ben Ijalana. I'd put Dalton Freeman over James Brewer because we need a backup Center, and I feel like Willie Colon will get the nod over Brian Winters."
nyjets,36b6nr,ThreeCranes,8,Mon May 18 01:00:12 2015 UTC,"There is no way Brian Winters makes it over Ben Ijalana.Also I don't care who Winters is working with I don't want him anywhere near  center,if he can't even play guard he wont be able to play center.  I personally think Taiwan Jones makes it over Joe Mays thats just me  I also could see Dakota Dozier getting  cut. He wasn't brought in by the FO compared to Jarvis Harrison and Willie Colon gives veteran presence to the interior offensive line."
nyjets,36b6nr,Rugger11,3,Mon May 18 00:35:39 2015 UTC,What are you trying to say about Dozier? He has far more upside than Harrison and Colon right now. Colon was a huge liability for us last season and a penalty magnet. I definitely see him having a harder time sticking than Dozier.
nyjets,36b6nr,ThreeCranes,1 point,Mon May 18 14:02:55 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna say Harrison has more upside,the only reason he lasted till the fifth round was his work ethic he has third round talent. I will agree with you that Dozier does have more upside than Colon but Colon gives us a backup guard with veteran experience."
nyjets,36b6nr,Rugger11,1 point,Mon May 18 14:50:59 2015 UTC,"Yes Colon is a vet with experience but he led the league in o-line penalties last season especially with declining play. That really doesn't lend itself to being a good ""vet with experience."""
nyjets,36b6nr,sharked,3,Mon May 18 16:18:07 2015 UTC,That O line does concern me a little.

nyjets,367rg1,HaruSoul,18,Sun May 17 00:49:37 2015 UTC,They lost Faneca. Looking back that O-line was absolutely stacked. thats a major reason why Jones ended up with the rushing title that season.
nyjets,367rg1,YummyTastyDelicious,3,Sun May 17 00:56:36 2015 UTC,We also had L.T. in 2010.

nyjets,367rg1,beefwellingtonIV,14,Sun May 17 01:19:48 2015 UTC,Part of what made that 2010 team so much fun was their string of late game come backs. The 2009 team was almost more fun to watch when they were on Defense. That was when Revis had his breakout season and teams would actually throw the ball his way.
nyjets,367rg1,bluesilver12,10,Sun May 17 01:25:04 2015 UTC,2010 if only because we knocked out the Pats. That was the best day of Jets football I ever watched.
nyjets,367rg1,Koolaidascope,7,Sun May 17 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"2010 for sure. Probably one of the best teams in Jets history outside 1968 and 1998. If they beat the Steelers in the AFC Championship game, they win the super bowl"

nyjets,367rg1,rcny,6,Mon May 18 13:45:56 2015 UTC,2009 I think was better on paper(top defense and rushing offense) but 2010 we saw a much better Sanchez and got an upgrade in CB2 with Cromartie.

Sanchez in '10 made clear strides, but against the 09 squad, would have been picked off multiple times. Something like a 17-14 win for the 09 team"
nyjets,367rg1,The_Big_Daddy,1 point,Mon May 18 16:54:04 2015 UTC,"I would go with 2010 just because the secondary (somehow) managed to get better, although the running game wasn't quite as potent."

The last coach the Jets hired (or actually plucked from under Kraft's nose) was the last time I was really pumped about it...Bill Parcells.    I've been a die hard Jets fan since third grade, and didn't have much company amongst my friends and classmates in that regard, as they were either Jints or Pats fans.

So many games in the NFL are very close and this slight edge could be just what was needed to win these games.   I get that you have a great team and a great coach and that's the main reason for success but it sure as hell didn't make you lose games.

Even if its true that the underinflation was purely a Brady & underlings sideshow, the Patriots franchise benefits from it (ala Superbowl win).    If Brady & the franchise were more cooperative with the NFL investigation, I'd be agreeable to a way lower draft pick, say 4th.  But as it stands, its pretty apparent that the phone text messages indicate a conspiracy was involved with the footballs, that the Patriots nor Brady were fully cooperative with the investigation, and the fans are sick of the Patriots always trying to pull underhanded shit, even when its technically permissible.  Its that behavior pattern that has to be broken.  Start operating above reproach; behave as Caesar's wife, not Caesar's hot mistress.  So yeah, your franchise should lose a 1st (but only that)."

Believe me, if it came down to that and that alone, we'd make a few jokes, have some laughs and be on our merry way. But unfortunately that's not where it ends. It's the fact that Tom Brady openly lied about his knowledge of football handling procedures (after all, he and Manning were the ones who lobbied the NFL for changes in the rules back in 2006), the fact that he complained to McNally and Jastremski after the Jets game (the one at Foxboro) about the way the footballs felt, and that he pulled a Clinton and declined to turn over cell phone and email records. Really, we wouldn't care less about this situation if Brady owned up, but the fact that a lot (note that I didn't say all here) of Patriots fans are trying to find ways to make the NFL and everyone else but Brady and the team out to be the bad guy really does nothing but make it that easier to make fun of the fanbase and justify our dislike. Look, we get it, some Patriots fans are more reasonable, logically minded and less biased than others, but as of right now, especially in the age of the internet, the crazies are running the asylum, and the jokes are practically writing themselves.

But until that, I just think its unfair to convict him in the court of public opinion of lying when we don't know that for sure. And as for the refusal to hand over the texts...there are reasonable explanations for that. And I can certainly understand why he might be loath to do so.   but the fact that a lot (note that I didn't say all here) of Patriots fans are trying to find ways to make the NFL and everyone else but Brady and the team out to be the bad guy really does nothing but make it that easier to make fun of the fanbase and justify our dislike. Look, we get it, some Patriots fans are more reasonable, logically minded and less biased than others, but as of right now, especially in the age of the internet, the crazies are running the asylum, and the jokes are practically writing themselves. Still, glad to see someone who isn't whining ""Taahhm Brady is innocent! Waaaaah! You ahhhl ahh just hatahs!!!   Yeah definitely. I get where you're coming from...trying to stay as impartial as I can haha. I'm supporting my team because I think the facts require that, but I'll be disappointed if it turns out Brady actually lied."
nyjets,365wd4,TheCowgirlCrusher,2,Sun May 17 15:18:43 2015 UTC,"Any person with a functioning ability to reason can tell Brady was directly involved in  some capacity just by how he is acting about the investigation. He is acting just like I do when I get caught and I think there is still a chance of getting out of it; I act dumb and I don't cooperate. This isn't a court of law, the NFL does not need evidence beyond the shadow of a doubt. However, I think the NFL has enough evidence where they could get a conviction in court anyways if this were in fact a public case simply based off the phone records.  I don't see how the evidence gathered suggest there is even a slight hope of innocence here between the ball boys, the phone records, the camera, etc. Suggesting Brady or New England is innocent is pretty ridiculous now. I think it's possible (maybe even likely) that Kraft and Bill Belichick had no clue about what was happening with the balls, but that doesn't change that at least some New England employees and Tom Brady himself were undeniably involved.  So we've established the rules have been knowingly bent. This leads the the punishment, which is admittedly a bit on the harsh side for deflating balls in a game that was clearly going to be won anyways. But is the punishment UNREASONABLY harsh? Absolutely not, and that has to do with Brady not cooperating (for which he was directly punished as a result, along with being punished for being the most influential person directly involved) along with discouraging more rule bending in the future by the Patriots.  First is the Brady suspension, four games. This is EXACTLY the number of games Brady needed to be suspended to make New England unsure about the playoffs this year. If judging by the last 15 years has told us anything at all, it's that four uncertain games are probably just enough to cost New England home field advantage, but not enough to keep them out of the playoffs entirely. This screams ""Stop bending the goddamn rules, New England"" if I've ever heard it.  Next are the draft picks. A first rounder and a fourth. This is where I think the NFL may have been a little too harsh. The additional fourth rounder is a little overboard in my opinion, but it's nothing completely unreasonable when you step back and look at New England. This team is a perennial contender year after year. Against all odds, when the roster is weak, when the roster is strong, when their division is weak, when their division is strong, New England competes in the playoffs annually. A punishment too weak would not be felt by the organization, and considering how well New England responds to adversity, even this might not affect the organization much.  Oh yeah, and finally there was the million dollar fine, which is pennies to the organization, and may cost the team up to two whole minimum value contracts. This is such a small punishment it hardly warrants mention, and will absolutely not affect the organization in any noticeable way during the season. This is a team already getting home discounts on elite talent just for being New England. They saved more money than this on McCourty's contract alone, this fine is not a strong punishment at all.  TL;DR: New England was punished mostly fairly. Not just for rule bending, but for being repeat rule benders, and for being rule benders who don't cooperate with investigators. The slight perceived harshness comes from New England's constant willingness to bend rules and coupled with being a perennial contender, which both need to be discouraged. If the punishment was much less severe, it risks not being a strong enough punishment to affect the organization at all, which is the final goal. The final goal is to discourage New England from bending rules YET AGAIN in the future by punishing them good enough where it hurts to sit down this season."
nyjets,365wd4,ZedSpot,2,Sun May 17 18:49:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I do have to disagree. I'll try to lay out why..     Any person with a functioning ability to reason can tell Brady was directly involved in  some capacity just by how he is acting about the investigation. This isn't a court of law, the NFL does not need evidence beyond the shadow of a doubt. However, I think the NFL has enough evidence where they could get a conviction in court anyways if this were in fact a public case simply based off the phone records.   The problem with this is that:   It may very well be true that Brady is directly involved in some capacity. However, we do not know that for sure. You can deride my ability to reason all you wish, but that doesn't prove it conclusively. I'm more than willing to admit that it's a possibility, and as I've said many times, if it is proved I won't blindly come to his defense--I'll criticize him. Regardless of how it looks to you, you do not have all the facts. Its the armchair jury thing that bothers me.  You say, ""He is acting just like I do when I get caught and I think there is still a chance of getting out of it; I act dumb and I don't cooperate."" Well no shit, that's what any normal person would do. And I'm sure it's what he was advised to do. Heck, take the phone thing. People are using that to paint Brady with the brush of guilt, but he may have been advised to not share them, to say nothing of possibly being worried about personal things on his phone, which is justifiable. The NFL does not have the evidence to get a conviction. Not when lawyers with actual law experience have looked at this and concluded otherwise (go read the abovethelaw piece), and not when the evidence is as shaky as it is (not to mention the term conviction isn't really the right one, but that's just quibbling).    I don't see how the evidence gathered suggest there is even a slight hope of innocence here between the ball boys, the phone records, the camera, etc. Suggesting Brady or New England is innocent is pretty ridiculous now. I think it's possible (maybe even likely) that Kraft and Bill Belichick had no clue about what was happening with the balls, but that doesn't change that at least some New England employees and Tom Brady himself were undeniably involved.   Given the problems with the report (leaving the possibility open that even if NE did try to manipulate the balls, it wasn't necessarily outside the legal boundaries), you would be hard-pressed to prove guilt. All the evidence is circumstantial, and can be explained away by various means. The deflator texts...despite the presence of an excuse, I will grant that it sounds really really fucking stupid. I still don't entirely buy it. But I don't know, maybe it's so stupid it's legit. I don't know. But aside from that....I think there's reason to defend Brady for his decision not to hand over his phone. I think there's reason to defend the refusal to go back for more interviews, after the emails that have come out, after the stuff about him trying to meet them partway and being refused, etc. I think there's plenty of uncertainty as far as the actual deflating, given the less than airtight handling by the refs and the tenuousness of the timeline that we have for the employee...enough to have doubt at least.    So we've established the rules have been knowingly bent.    Disagree, as explained above. It hasn't been conclusively established, at least not yet.   This leads the the punishment, which is admittedly a bit on the harsh side for deflating balls in a game that was clearly going to be won anyways. But is the punishment UNREASONABLY harsh? Absolutely not, and that has to do with...(truncated for length, but I'm quoting here to the end)   The problem with this is that you're arguing the NFL tailored its punishment to the Patriots, basing it on their competitiveness as a team (the length and its impact on playoff hunt, and the draft picks). This is incorrect. The NFL is not supposed to do this. If it came out that the NFL decided a punishment this arbitrarily, it would not be good for the league. And when the punishment seems greatly out of scale compared to others (Bountygate for ex.)...that's concerning.  Also, your point about the fine misses the point entirely. The problem is that it is to date the largest such fine ever levied (and in fact was applied as two 500k fines as a means of circumventing the 500k maximum in the CBA). So...so what if it was pennies? The significance is still notable.    I'll address the TL;DR quickly:   Not just for rule bending, but for being repeat rule benders, and for being rule benders who don't cooperate with investigators.    The former is based solely on Spygate; I get it, but    The slight perceived harshness comes from New England's constant willingness to bend rules and    Constant is false.    coupled with being a perennial contender, which both need to be discouraged.   This doesn't make sense. The NFL punishes teams for being contenders now?   If the punishment was much less severe, it risks not being a strong enough punishment to affect the organization at all, which is the final goal. The final goal is to discourage New England from bending rules YET AGAIN in the future by punishing them good enough where it hurts to sit down this season.   Fair enough.     In summary, I just think there's some issues with this response (and feel free to debate me on this, I enjoy a healthy debate). I disagree with you that we can judge Brady's involvement or guilt that easily, and your section on the punishment is quantifiably inaccurate. Essentially, the thing that we all have an issue with (besides the report itself, which requires no explanation for its issues) is that there have been enough reasons to cast doubt on Brady's guilt. Could he be guilty? Sure. I'll happily admit I was wrong if that's the case, and you can tag me--I'm a realistic guy. But until more facts come out, I'm against premature judgments, and I think he deserves his day in court.   That's my view at least. Look forward to your response, and hope we can have a pleasant debate. Apologies for the length of my response, btw (and hopefully it's all clear, I wrote it pretty fast)."
nyjets,365wd4,IAMADeinonychusAMA,3,Sun May 17 23:20:44 2015 UTC,"That was a very quality response and I hold you in higher regard than most redditors now. I worded a few points wrong, like discouraging perennial contention. I didn't mean the NFL should go out of their way to try to stop teams that frequently win from winning more. I meant the New England organization should be nervous about contending this season right now, because that is a major part of the punishment.  First, here's my perception of New England. I think BB is the GOAT coach. He wows me with strategy and tactics every year, I think he's hilarious, he used to be the Giant's defensive coordinator, I love the guy more than non-New England fans. That being said, one of the things that makes him great is his ability to find advantages in every possible facet of the game. This inevitably leads to him doing things that are not illegal, but clearly affect the spirit of the game.  I'll take the Ravens eligible receiver issue that popped up recently. It is absolutely not against the rules in any way to report as eligible before the ball is snapped. Where it hurts the spirit of the game is that it gives defenders absolutely no time to visualize what their responsibility is and could easily result in a completely blown coverage because of one player. Not a player that was outsmarted by football techniques, or outplayed physically, but a player that was basically tricked into not having any idea of what to expect. This can be further extended, to the point where an entire touchdown could easily be scored not by outsmarting the opponent's defense, but by catching one person the unit off guard in a way that is completely impossible to defend against. Now you have a situation where touchdowns could potentially be scored like coinflips. Will all the defenders have enough time to react? Flip the coin, see how likely it is that someone misstepped in their coverage. This rule is now under review and will be changed next season because of the way it can potentially be used to make skill and strategy a nonfactor.  The NFL is growing tired of things like this, the testing of the spirit of the game. The formation BB used on that play was brilliant. Four linemen. Unthinkable. Absolutely brilliant. Totally legal. Encouraged, even. But that brilliance is overshadowed by being underhanded in the way it was executed. I'm out of time now, but this thing happens with BB. He thinks about the game on another level and comes up with crazy advantages no one else would think of. Some advantages he comes up with have the potential to literally break the competitiveness of the game, like the eligibility one. The NFL wants to make sure BB doesn't keep pushing the envelope so hard, and the only way to do that is to punish the organization in a way that truly discourages pushing lines like this again. That's why New England's case should be handled differently than a team like Oakland. (I don't think BB was involved in the ball pressure, but the envelope pushing culture seems to be present in New England)"

I definitely see where you're coming from, but personally I'm of the view that if the rulebook allows for it, one can't really complain, and finding strategies like this can be seen (at least in my view) as simply clever. I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree there, since frankly I can definitely see the reasoning behind both viewpoints. I guess it's like evasion in pokemon (bear with me, I'm a hardcore player haha)...some might see it as uncompetitive and cheap, others see it as a legitimate strategy; I can see both points but happen to lean more towards the latter. IMO if anyone has a problem with it, they can modify the rule, which the NFL is doing now; before that though they really can't complain.   The NFL wants to make sure BB doesn't keep pushing the envelope so hard, and the only way to do that is to punish the organization in a way that truly discourages pushing lines like this again.

(I don't think BB was involved in the ball pressure, but the envelope pushing culture seems to be present in New England)   Yeah I see what you're saying. That being said, I feel like if said envelope-pushing is technically legal, then including it in the reasoning for this punishment is inherently arbitrary and biased. If Oakland had done it, that shouldn't change the punishment (not even getting into the overly harsh nature of it, that's separate...just the team aspect). I feel like Spygate, sure--I think people are making way too big of a deal about Spygate now, but if you're going to talk about a ""culture"", it should be in relation to Spygate rather than any legal envelope-pushing. Know what I'm saying?"

You end up making more money than the fine anyway by winning the Super Bowl so there's really nothing to lose other than a draft pick.
nyjets,365efl,wishistudiedphysics,12,Sat May 16 08:49:21 2015 UTC,What part of 4 games and two draft picks is not a major repercussion?  You can't seriously think they would strip the super bowls. Incredible

But hey Kraft gets to save only $800,000 instead of $1,800,000 on Brady's suspension so there's that."

nyjets,365efl,IAMADeinonychusAMA,3,Sat May 16 22:15:11 2015 UTC,"The practice balls being used in game is documented and not an accusation. They were caught using practice balls that were not checked and approved. When they were caught they could not give any explanation on how they wound up in the game and were sent a warning letter from the NFL. Also the admission about using unauthorized frequencies for the receiver in Brady's helmet and it staying on the entire time instead of shutting off at 15 seconds like they should came from their own QB and came out the same time as spy gate. The NFL just did not do anything about it. It is almost impossible to prove unless they pick the frequency up during the game.  So, these things happened and were reported and documented 8 and 11 years ago. People acing like these things are just coming out now in an attempt to pile on is what is bullshit. These things were well documented and for the practice balls were completely proven. You don't get to complain that it is brought up now that they are in another cheating scandal.  That is like someone who has been caught stealing a car getting mad that it gets brought up in court when he has been arrested again for stealing a car."

nyjets,36572m,machu_chuchu,18,Sat May 16 06:34:44 2015 UTC,If we had a Russel Wilson at QB in 2009 the Jets would have won the Superbowl.
nyjets,36572m,RTepps,6,Sat May 16 17:05:48 2015 UTC,"Above average, below elite seems to be the consensus on Wilson. My biggest qualm with him is his performance in this past Superbowl. Aside from the prayer throws with brilliant catches, he was pretty bad, and I don't think he gets the criticism that he deserves for it."
nyjets,36572m,Andaroodle,0,Sat May 16 16:38:20 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree. He's not at Luck's level, and Luck isn't even in the elite tier of QBs. I think the second these guys play good ball, pundits and the like start talking them up as these superstars. Whether it be Flacco, Luck, Wilson, whoever. In reality, though, they can't hold a candle to Brady, Rodgers, Manning, etc.  With Wilson, you've got a good QB who won't (usually) lose the game, and on occasion can put the team on his back when he needs to. Otherwise, he plays supporting cast to a great defense and an absolute nightmare of a RB. I'd absolutely take him here in a heartbeat, no doubt, but that still doesn't make him elite. In the end, he's a rich man's Alex Smith."
nyjets,36572m,BigNuke43,1 point,Sun May 17 05:01:03 2015 UTC,"It amazes me how people want to dump on the guy because of one pass. He's a great quarterback. He has a great arm, he's accurate, and most importantly he makes consistently good decisions. For some reason, the idiot-hivemind of /r/nfl seems to think that because he doesn't throw it as much as Luck that he must not be as good. As Sideshow Bob once said, ""There no Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry.""   Wilson is easily the most valuable player on that team, and if you put him on the Jets c. 2009 and 2010 we might have won a Superbowl. I would kill (preferably a Patriots player) for Russell Wilson or a quarterback of his caliber to play for the Jets. We could really contend with a passer like that."
nyjets,36572m,SpygateHernandez,1 point,Wed May 20 13:36:45 2015 UTC,If you watch a lot of wilson you'll realize that he's miles away from being a game manager. The offense would be nothing without him and I don't even think they'd make the playoffs with a lower tier starter at qb
nyjets,36572m,GV22,1 point,Sat May 16 15:58:06 2015 UTC,I think they could still make the playoffs with a different qb because of the running game and defense. They wouldn't ever be favored to win a game in the playoffs though.
nyjets,36572m,STNbrossy,3,Sun May 17 04:25:10 2015 UTC,With an average qb I can see them as a 9-7 wild card at best and nowhere near the superbowl contenders they've been the past 2 years
nyjets,36572m,GV22,2,Sun May 17 04:33:41 2015 UTC,"People under appreciate Russ all the time. He makes up 71% of Seattle's total offensive yards and he does it with Kearse and Baldwin as his starting receivers. Baldwin is the best out of them and he is only a high end #3 on any other team in the league. He does all this while also having one of the bottom 10 pass protecting lines in the league.   Wilson being on the team also helps Lynch but no one gives him credit there either. Without Russell running on those read options Lynch wouldn't be nearly as successful. Russell freezes defenders all the time that gives Lynch that little extra time to hit a hole chugging at full speed to bow someone over.   So overall I don't think Seattle could do as well as they have done these last few years with any other QB but Russell. Even if you put Rodgers on the team he isn't going to be successful throwing to Kearse and Baldwin like Russell was last year and he would have a significantly worse offensive line.   The thing is is that Russell's agent by most reports is wanting 25 mil per year which is just insane. The Seahawks can pay Rus his rookie deal in 2015 for 1.6, franchise tag him next season for around 20 and then franchise tag him again which would be around 24 or 25mil and it would still be cheaper than giving him the contract he wants at this moment. By the time the tag ends in 2017 some of the big contracts on the Seahawks will be off the books in Lynch and Mebane freeing up a lot of space to give Russell what he wants at that time. For the time being though if Russell isn't going to take a reasonable deal it is better to just leave him on his rookie deal and then sign back Wagner this offseason. By most rumors the actual friction is that his agent wants a new deal that takes over this year instead of just an extension. A new deal would make his rookie pay this year disappear but an extension means he has to play out his rookie deal this year and then his big contract kicks in next season which his agent is against and the Seahawks are against a new deal. So one will have to compromise. If Russell gets a new deal this year there will be no Wagner resigning this year most likely."
nyjets,36572m,Neutron_Raptor,-2,Mon May 18 11:07:25 2015 UTC,"Sure!  But there is still no way they let him go to free agency and the Jets would have to kill their roster to acquire him via trade. It ain't happening kid.  Geno's our guy, get used to it."
nyjets,36572m,viewless25,2,Sat May 16 07:52:16 2015 UTC,"I'm rooting for geno, I'm just commenting on the hypothetical. I've seen a lot of seahawks fans saying how he's replaceable (""just draft a bridgewater and let him sit for a year or two""), and I'm here thinking how hard it is to find even a good quarterback"
nyjets,36572m,John_YJKR,4,Sat May 16 07:56:44 2015 UTC,The seahawks few years of success has made some of their fanbase forget what their team was for many years. NFC west cannon fodder. Really it's likely band wagon fans who think that because they don't know what it was like because they were Steelers or cowboys fans back then. And they won't stick around for the bad years while the seahawks try to replace him. So it's easy for them to say get rid of Wilson.
nyjets,36572m,bigbadbouncer,2,Sat May 16 08:35:01 2015 UTC,That's because most of their fanbase didn't exist until after Russell Wilson was already there
nyjets,36572m,viewless25,1 point,Sat May 16 18:32:31 2015 UTC,"Wilson's a great QB and that's why the negotiations are taking a while. I haven't seen any fan or commentator claim he's replaceable. Super Bowl quarterbacks aren't replaceable and they won't try. The question is do they bite the bullet now or try their odds with the reports of the Newton and Luck deals? They'll probably take the former, but its starting to seem like the latter is more likely."

Fuck Herm Edwards for putting him in a preseason game behind a third string OL. 5) this is our year."

I always pulled for Pennington. I learned this from my friend. The irrational optimism is refreshing.  My friends and I generally always expect Dallas sports teams to disappoint us (except for the Mavs; a deep playoff run is always possible with Cuban as an owner).   What happens when the Giants and Patriots play? Do we bury our heads in the sand and ignore the game entirely? I probably hate the Giants more than any other team in professional sports."

Granted, my favorite offseason quote for the Jets to others is 'cautiously optimistic, I've been hurt before' but Cowboy fans, they're just outright dismal.  It's sad when I have to explain, usually to what feels like a wall, that there's 20 other NFL teams out there that would literally kill for your QB, and all the fanbase does is shit all over Tony Romo.  I will admit though, sports radio down here is always ten times more hilarious when the Cowboys suck. The Wade Phillip years and the associated press conference drinking game was always a fav of mine."

I'm also glad that you appreciate the fact that when you root for the Jets you essentially have to root for the Mets.

nyjets,35zhkr,bigsten15,3,Fri May 15 04:17:09 2015 UTC,"Yep I'm obviously biased and will defend the Pats but I think everyone would defend their team in this situation. If there was hard evidence proving Brady did deflate balls then I would be a little disappointed and would not be fighting this although I would be angry at people saying his legacy is tarnished because I don't think it's that big of a deal. But the report came off as very biased and made a lot of assumptions and didn't put a lot of the evidence in context. Most of the problem is the media that tries to summarize a report and will look for the headline and in this case it's how they explained the term ""deflate"" and now people are only talking about that and not the other 59 pages. Thanks for looking at the other side though and I have changed my opinion  on this investigation many times and now after reading the Pats response I really believe that nothing honestly happened, like I said though I am biased. It's definitely bringing out the worst in fans though. I usually only talk about football on reddit and never try and make jokes and get karma but that's been really hard lately.

nyjets,35zhkr,bigsten15,2,Fri May 15 05:15:47 2015 UTC,"So I'm guessing you're not going to read it? It seems you've made up your mind without actually reading into it. It's not conspiracy theories at all. Wells did the math wrong when calculating the PSI for the balls at the game and when done by Roderick MacKinnon a Professor and Nobel Laureate Chemistry and when she did the math the Pats balls were perfectly in range of where they should be.   How about the fact that the Colts broke rule 2  which states, Once the game starts, neither team is allowed to gauge the footballs, pump them, or the like. That is solely the province of the referee, who is to be the “sole judge” of whether footballs comply. The Colts, with advance concerns about psi, did not take the issue to the referee. They took the matter into their own hands and had an intern gauge the football. (pg. 63) This conduct was in violation of Rule 2. Nowhere does the Report identify this conduct as a violation of the Rule. That was barely mentioned.   There's tons more information and info that shows that Wells is biased and I can give it to you or you can listen to ESPN and just ignore facts and just hook onto that one little piece where they say deflate is used at a term to lose weight and just say the whole thing is nonsense. You're literally not looking at the facts and choosing to listen to ESPN who has been pushing this story and just attacks the dumbest part of the report. Read the report then tell me it's bullshit and I'll be fine with that but don't look at one tiny piece that was picked out and not put into context and tell me it's bullshit. It seems like you don't want to change your opinion though but I can give a lot more info with links if you want. ESPN/twitter/blogs don't want to give the facts, they want to summarize something without adding context and will just point out the most interesting facts in the report."

I have a BSc and MSc but I wouldn't give my advice on a chemistry issue, because it's not my field of study.

If they had approved the interview and McNally said on the spot that ""deflating"" was a term they used for weight loss then maybe nothing would have come of it. But if he had told the Pats that the interview would be specifically about those texts and they still gave that answer then people would claim he was coached by the legal team, which, hey, still may have gone their way. But instead they gave Wells the finger and he was forced to make a judgement based on what evidence he had.

Most likely because Goodell wanted to be the one to hear any appeals, because he knows hes bs. This is why when he pulls more bs during the appeals process it will go to court and he will lose badly, with the many, many holes in the Wells report. If they thought the Wells Report was concrete, Mr.Wells would not have had to come out and publicly defend himself when his integrity was questioned, which happens to every investigator at some point or another. If this was happening to Peyton Manning, Bradys biggest rival, I would still say the same and have the same point of view, so it has nothing to do with being a fan."

That is completely reasonable given the parameters that they were asking for. Wells basically said Brady was free to divulge whatever he wanted to in printed out texts and he still refused. You can see how that makes him look guilty as fuck right? Then not granting an interview with the Deflator after learning that he referred to himself as the Deflator in texts. Maybe it really is a big misunderstanding, but when you have a track record of doing shady stuff already then basically telling the investigator to fuck off you can see how that makes them look right?

nyjets,35yrzg,zaboga,2,Thu May 14 19:00:43 2015 UTC,"The Jets aren't the villains here. The military services do not get advertising space (online, broadcast, billboards, etc.) for free. They pay for it just like everyone else. There are budgets allocated for recruiting and this is just another venue for that.  Now, why are the Jets seemingly being singled out? Well... ""one theory goes that a former high-ranking officer in the NJ Guard felt slighted when passed over for promotion and went on to the press with this story to tarnish the reputation of the NJ Guard. It ended up tarnishing the Jets instead.""  No sense in targeting the Jets since this goes on in most stadiums. The stuff you see on tv news and events during the holidays (the ""hi, I'm in Iraqi-stan and I want to say happy holidays to my family..."") on tv are generally placed there as a courtesy."

nyjets,361nzw,Capon3,13,Fri May 15 10:16:29 2015 UTC,"Mehta: Patriots 'Deflator' explanation simply a big fat joke  by MANISH MEHTA  Jim McNally deserves our support. Deflation can be a long and arduous road that requires discipline and mental fortitude. Losing the last five pounds during deflation is the hardest part.  The self-described “Deflator” in the PSI: Foxborough scandal that has rocked the Super Bowl champion Patriots apparently has a much more important issue to tackle: The battle of the bulge.  The Patriots lawyered up and in a sad attempt to create reasonable doubt with the desperate hope that the gullible and weak-minded will buy their knee-slapping hilarity.  “The Wells Report in Context” penned by attorney Daniel L. Goldberg was a manuscript for the stupid.  The few passages of believability were overshadowed by mountains of nonsense highlighted by the preposterous notion that McNally, the disgraced locker room assistant in the DeflateGate saga that has further sullied the Patriots’ brand, labeled himself the “Deflator” because he wanted to lose weight, not because he deflated footballs to appease Tom Brady.  “(Patriots equipment assistant) Mr. Jastremski would sometimes work out and bulk up — he is a slender guy and his goal was to get to 200 pounds,” the report stated. “Mr. McNally is a big fellow and had the opposite goal: to lose weight. 'Deflate' was a term they used to refer to losing weight.""  The Patriots and Goldberg didn’t limit their attempts to insult your intelligence to just this one ludicrous example. There were seemingly no bounds to the hogwash.  The Patriots’ rebuttal attempted to explain away incidents detailed in Ted Wells’ findings by painting John Jastremski and McNally as a couple of guys whose explicit texts were misunderstood by rational-thinking humans.  McNally’s text in May 2014 that “im not going to espn… yet” was not a threat to pull the plug on Brady’s preference for softer footballs, the Patriots contended.  No, it was just one of many “jocular” messages between McNally and Jastremski. McNally’s ESPN joke was merely his way of telling his pal that he wouldn’t blow the whistle if/when he got free sneakers (INSERT EYEROLL HERE).  There were odd occurrences in the run-up to the AFC Championship Game that raised suspicion, but no cause for alarm. McNally’s 1 minute, 40 second disappearing act into a bathroom in the bowels of Gillette Stadium 20 minutes before kickoff can be easily explained, Goldberg & associates insisted.  “The (Wells) report does not address whether one minute and 40 is consistent with the time that it takes a gentleman to enter a bathroom, relieve himself, wash his hands, and leave,” Goldberg actually wrote. “In fact, it is.”  No more details, however, on whether the time for a gentleman to engage in the act of No. 1 or No. 2 would differ. Perhaps that will be addressed in the new afterword in Goldberg’s next edition.  Deflating Tom Brady's footballs was never discussed by Jim McNally and John Jastremski, the Patriots would have you believe.  The Patriots went to great lengths to defend Jastremski and McNally… a week after Robert Kraft indefinitely suspended them. (See: new afterword for further explanation/lie).  Goldberg’s report appeared to be a compilation of the Patriots spin that had been spilled out through various friends of the program in recent days.  One story kicked off Thursday morning with some nifty propaganda in the wake of an ESPN/ABC News Poll. Rather than highlight the fact that 63 percent of people believed that the NFL’s punishment for the Patriots’ involvement in Deflategate was warranted and more than half felt that Brady cheated, the headline came straight out of One Patriots Place: “Other teams cheated, too.”  Goldberg saturated his long-winded retort with too much pie-in-the-sky outrageousness to be taken seriously, which is too bad since there was a relatively compelling case from 2003 Nobel Prize winner Roderick MacKinnon that challenged the air-pressure analysis in the Wells report.  Goldberg wrote that MacKinnon “had no previous business or personal relationship with the Patriots,” but the Boston Globe uncovered that Robert Kraft invested in his start-up company last year.  Regardless, MacKinnon, a professor at The Rockefeller University in New York, leaned on the Ideal Gas Law to explain why the Colts’ footballs had different PSI readings than the Patriots’ footballs. Much of the rest of Goldberg’s report was filled with hot air.  The NFLPA filed the requisite paperwork Thursday afternoon to appeal Brady’s four-game suspension, but there’s been no update on what will happen to poor McNally.   There’s only one sensible way for the Deflator to get out of this mess now:  No carbs after 7 p.m."

NG thought it would be a good recruiting tool for them by use of advertising and Military displays before, and videos during the games, and NFL fans would hit their target demographic.   The Jets, IMO, blurred the lines by accepting money because it can call into question any other time they may have tried to show support, honor the military, or servicemen.   It is a slippery slope when you try to wrap yourself in the flag, then accept money for doing it.  They were wrong, no matter how many good deeds or money they may have donated over the years."

nyjets,35x680,TreSeven,3,Thu May 14 13:02:24 2015 UTC,"With Devin Smith you're hoping for Desean Jackson, Torrey Smith or Mike Wallace. Decker and Marshall are receivers who win off of physicality and positioning as opposed to blowing the top off of the D. Kerley and Amaro and primarily underneath guys. Smith is everything we're missing in the receiving corps.  Most importantly in my eyes is that he's not considered a great prospect as a deep threat because of pure speed. He's fast but there were a good amount of faster guys available, this wasn't a Stephen Hill pick based on combine numbers. What makes him a great deep threat prospect is his ability to track the ball mid air and adjust."

nyjets,35x680,CosmicWy,2,Thu May 14 20:49:38 2015 UTC,"Kevin White is a scary prospect.  He was OK in college and THEN he blew up and had a huge year.  If i'm taking a player top 10, I want to be sure he's gonna dominate.  I don't think Kevin White is about to be Julio Jones.  I'm happy we passed on him.  He may turn out to be a great player.  Amari on the other hand I think might be a special talent."
nyjets,35x680,SpygateHernandez,1 point,Thu May 14 21:34:40 2015 UTC,"I personally am glad that we didn't end up with White. I'm sure he'll be a fine receiver, but to me receiver just isn't a position you can draft that high unless you've got the next coming of Randy Moss on your hands. Receiver is honestly probably the least impactful position in football. I'm glad we were able to nab Williams. Defensive linemen just have a much bigger impact on the game, and to me when you're drafting that high you've got to go with a quarterback, a corner, or a defensive lineman, simply because those are the biggest ""difference-maker"" positions."

nyjets,35um6n,m63646,-4,Thu May 14 04:16:04 2015 UTC,Something I just caught on my twitter feed. Wouldn't surprise me considering how long Spygate was going on.
nyjets,35um6n,pr3167,-29,Wed May 13 17:22:54 2015 UTC,"Only a year? The NFL sent a memo out early in 06 saying that you couldn't film from the sideline.

Secondly they continued to do it after the NFL told everyone they couldn't.  Pat fans who complain about spygate should stfu considering the NFL was so busy trying to make it go away that they ignored the fact that the Pats were using unauthorized radio frequencies to talk to Brady the entire game even past the 15 second cut off.  This came from the Patriots own QB when he picked up Brady's helmet by mistake."

nyjets,35um6n,games456,4,Wed May 13 18:15:31 2015 UTC,Whether they did or didn't doesn't even matter. The Pats are the ones who did after the league sent a letter to everyone saying don't do this and pretty much said we are watching you.  But know what your opponents are going to do was too important to them.
nyjets,35um6n,pr3167,-18,Wed May 13 18:31:52 2015 UTC,"But know what your opponents are going to do was too important to them.   They didn't gain any competitive advantage from SpyGate.

How tight are your homer goggles for you to actually believe that? Why else would they be spying on other teams then? For fun? You don't think that knowing exactly what plays the other team is calling gives a football team any sort of competitive advantage whatsoever? A friend of mine is a hardcore Patriots fan, and even he admits that SpyGate was dirty and gave you guys an advantage. Actually admitting that your team did something wrong isn't such a hard thing to do, and makes you look helluva lot more mature and reasonable.   Continue to be jealous, it's not getting you anywhere.   Ah yes, the ""they hate us cuz the ain't us"" that we hear so much from you guys. Guess what? Not too many people hated the Steelers dynasty, or the 49ers dynasty, hell even the Cowboys dynasty didn't get as much hate as you guys do. The Patriots have gotten so much more hate not because people are jealous, but because you guys have cheated again and again; and your poor reputation is not at all helped by how obnoxious your fanbase can be with trying to justify clear-cut cheating."

nyjets,35um6n,pr3167,-10,Thu May 14 12:47:58 2015 UTC,"You don't think that knowing exactly what plays the other team is calling gives a football team any sort of competitive advantage whatsoever?    They filmed the other team's signals just like every other team in the league. It was legal, just not from the sideline. They recorded the same video from the sideline that they would have recorded in the box. If a player is making signals in front of a whole NFL stadium, how are you going to say it's cheating to record them?   If they did something wrong, I would admit it. But I don't see anything wrong   ""“Stealing someone’s signals was a part of the game and everybody attempted to do that. We had people that always tried to steal signals,” said Cowher, whose 2004 team won 16 consecutive games before losing to the Patriots in the AFC title game. “What happened when we lost that game is they outplayed us. It had nothing to do with stealing signals or cheating or anything else.”"
nyjets,35um6n,Gormash888,3,Wed May 13 19:39:28 2015 UTC,"Then why didn't they record it from the box? Belichick deliberately violated rules, and I have to expect that for someone of his intellectual caliber to do it this way instead of by the book then it had to give him an advantage. They broke NFL rules, which is cheating, and were punished accordingly. While the Steelers claim it didn't have much impact, Warner did say that they could have potential impact on the game.  Unfortunately, we'll never know what was on those tapes as Goodell destroyed them AFAIK, but I have to imagine that it had to have been something pretty damning for him to completely trash the tapes."
nyjets,35um6n,pr3167,-6,Wed May 13 19:59:33 2015 UTC,Not arguing with you anymore. Good luck this season.
nyjets,35um6n,krsj,-2,Wed May 13 20:05:13 2015 UTC,From what I have read about spygate Belichick thought the rulle change was stupid and was basically just giving a middle finger to the league and was rightfully punished. I personally think the punishment for spygate was too high but goodell obviously wanted to make an example of the pats. I think the whole make example of a pats thing was a lot more justified in that case than some others.
nyjets,35um6n,throwthisaway_please,-6,Thu May 14 00:42:28 2015 UTC,So you are saying that it doesn't matter if the Jets did it before the memo was sent out?
nyjets,35um6n,games456,3,Wed May 13 20:47:35 2015 UTC,"No I am saying I do not want to argue with another Patriot fan who is too dumb to realize that the jets who was ""caught"" taping was in the end zone stands, even the Patriots themselves said that. That area is not a restricted area.  The Restricted areas for recording during the game where there are no recording devices allowed are the sideline, the coaches booth and the locker room.  So the Patriots were caught recording on the sideline, where it is not legal. The reason why I said it does not even matter if the Jets did it, which the only proof is the patriots saying they were by the way. Is that even if they were the were in the stands in the end zone."

nyjets,35wkx2,SeeDeez,1 point,Thu May 14 13:23:29 2015 UTC,I'll allow it
nyjets,35wkx2,jetsfan07,3,Thu May 14 15:33:52 2015 UTC,"Why would our team want to benefit the Bills? I'd trade him for no less than a third if it's the Bills. A 5th from any other team is about what I value him.  And yes, I know we got him for a 7th. Just saying he's worth more on our roster than not."
nyjets,35wkx2,viewless25,2,Thu May 14 03:02:28 2015 UTC,I'll try to give you as serious an answer as possible:  We need his Veteran presence as I'm sure you can relate. So we'd have to take a vet QB like Cassel and some kind of pick compensation on the scale of 2016 6th to 7th rounder. Wouldn't be a good deal for Buffalo.

nyjets,35wkx2,shahataman,1 point,Thu May 14 03:20:20 2015 UTC,There's no chance the Bill trade for Fitz because he wasn't a member of the Jets when Rex coached the team.
nyjets,35wkx2,SeeDeez,1 point,Thu May 14 16:24:43 2015 UTC,I wouldn't trade him after reuniting him with Gailey. If I had to I'd do it for Cassell and a 4th rounder.  I've never heard of an NFL team making a bad trade just to sabotage a rival. Can anyone provide an example of this?
nyjets,35wkx2,Manginaz,0,Fri May 15 20:47:42 2015 UTC,I'll give you Fitz for Rex as our DC

Maybe you don't have anything against the Jets, but most of your fanbase does. Check /r/NFL during the year and you'll see that the Patriots and Dolphins are equally obsessed with the Jets, if not moreso.  2) Remember Brady wasn't fined for the balls. He was fined for trying to foil the investigation. If you really think he didn't refuse the NFL any vital information, you're delusional.   This isn't a social experiment. You just asked a group of people two questions. Also when you say an honest answer ""probably won't happen"" you're insulting us and limiting the chances of getting an honest answer"

The Colts, who were cheated, get to stew over their 45-7 title game drubbing. The Patriots get to keep their trophy. Where’s the justice?""  In almost every other sport, you get caught cheating, you end up being stripped of the title.  A few examples:  2004-05 USC Trojans stripped of BCS Championship due to Reggie Bush receiving illegal gifts.  Memphis basketball had to vacated it's 2007–08 Runner-up(Lost title game) status due to Derrick Rose's ineligibility.  Lance Armstong lost all of his Tour de France wins due to doping  Jackie Robinson West had to vacate it's title last year due to using ineligible players from outside their region.   Basically what I'm getting at is why is it that professional sports are unwilling to strip a team of a title even if they know they cheated to get it. Compared to other sports this punishment is nothing more than a slap on the wrist despite the way they are trying to frame it as a harsh punishment."

nyjets,35tiea,JGand72,7,Wed May 13 12:59:33 2015 UTC,"""Beyond a reasonable doubt"" isn't the standard here."
nyjets,35tiea,John_YJKR,5,Wed May 13 13:01:12 2015 UTC,So beyond reasonable doubt is used usually exclusively in criminal trials. In civil trials the term preponderance of evidence is used instead. They are essentially equivalent. More probable than not meets the preponderance of evidence standard. I used beyond reasonable doubt because people don't understand what preponderance of evidence means. So yes they did prove it was more probable than not which is preponderance of evidence which is the Civil suit version of the criminal trial term beyond reasonable doubt.

If Janine Garoppolo looks half way decent in the first 4 games, there will be a QB controversy in New England, leading to Belicheat heartlessly trading or cutting Brady next offseason. (Thanks to his contract restructure, he won't count as dead money if cut.)    If Brady somehow manages to play the whole year, his age will finally start to show and he'll probably be dealing with nagging injuries from the murderer's row of d-lines in the AFCE. Couple that with the fact that NE will be playing from behind quite a bit (terrible secondary), and he could be sacked 40 times next year. This would lead to fast-tracking the more mobile Garoppolo to start in '16."

Last year was miserable, but we have a new GM who has really restocked the talent on the team. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, we should be in contention for the league's top defense. We've actually been somewhat of a defensive powerhouse for the better part of a decade. Our defensive line in particular is arguably the best in the league. We're trying to kill Brady with it.   Our offense isn't so great. We have decent players at almost all the positions, except QB. I read an article that described us ""headless horsemen"", because if we had an even average QB, we would be immediate Super Bowl contenders. But this is the most talent we've had on this side of the ball since our last deep playoff runs (2009, 2010), so it should be exciting.   As for the fan base, in here you'll find more of the rational ones. The broader non-redditing fan base is a little more...emotional. If you look at the other posts on our sub, the top one right now is about some fans who bought billboards saying 'Tom Shady', in light of the deflate gate business. I think this illustrates several things about the fan base:  1) We really hate the Patriots. Fuck those guys. We revel in their misery.  2) Sometimes we get a little emotional and impulsive. It's always interesting around here.   3) We love outdoor media.   On this sub, you'll find people who are a little more rational, and likely have less disposable income than the billboard people. We're generally upbeat and like to have fun, at the patriots expense if possible (seriously fuck those guys). This team has been through the wringer since the 60s, so sometimes we do get pessimistic, especially when Geno plays the Bills (he really can't figure them out).   We're also coming to London this year to play the Dolphins, which should make for a good rivalry game. Both teams have been relatively even in recent years, although we've knocked them out of the playoffs the last 2 years (it was awesome). Regardless of what team you pick, as a fan of the game you should try and go to that one."

First of all, this lends itself to fans having intense pride, because just around the corner there could be a shit-talking giants fan(Unlike in New England or Green Bay, where around every corner there's just a Brady/Rodgers circle jerk.) More importantly though, the Jets are the little brother of New York Football. As much as I hate to say it, they Giants are the more popular team. Because of this, it seems we have less wishy-washy fans. The fair-weather-fans all have made their way over to the Giants over the years, leaving us with grizzled, die-hard, bleed-green-and-white, true motherfuckin' Jets fans. We love our team. It's not easy being a Jets fan, but it's worth it. I once met a group of green and white paint-covered Aussies in the parking lot after a game. They seemed cool, so despite the fact that we live 2 hours south of the stadium, we drove those Aussie Jets fans onto the island, because their ride was going to be late.  So, the moral is, if you want to be a patsy, take your allegiance to one of the circle-jerk subs, whose days in the sun are slowly fading. If you want to be a part of an amazing, loyal fanbase of die hards, stick around. It's a new dawn, it's a new day, and I'm feelin good."
nyjets,35re5p,Fishbirds,1 point,Wed May 13 14:23:28 2015 UTC,"It depends on the kind of team you like to root for. The Patriots are stonefaced killing machines, but the Jets brim with underdog enthusiasm and are not taken seriously until it is too late. Being a Jets' fan means taking the butt end of a lot of jokes until your Jetsies go out on the field and hit the other team in the mouth with unmatched bravado."
nyjets,35re5p,BigNuke43,-13,Wed May 13 14:37:28 2015 UTC,"Clearly, you should support a team with a storied history and championship pedigree. Clearly.  For real, though, if you get to choose, do yourself a favor and pick a better team. Save yourself the headache and frustration. Still, have some character don't root for a cheating franchise like the Patriots."

nyjets,35pbsf,DoritoSlayer,2,Tue May 12 19:54:01 2015 UTC,Please enlighten me with your facts.
nyjets,35pbsf,HaruSoul,2,Tue May 12 20:00:46 2015 UTC,"Cool, I'd love to discuss it and I welcome any counter points.  This whole situation is really fucking odd and anything that helps get closer to the truth (whatever that may be) is welcome.  The oddest fact is the testimony of Referee Walt Anderson, the guy who measured the footballs PSI, which is the only thing the report uses to indicate that tampering even occurred.   Since the results and methods were not logged the entire case is based off  his recollection. The report states that Anderson's recollection was measuring the Pats balls with the 'logo gauge' with a crooked needle and that the balls were at 12.5 PSI.  If we accept that testimony then the Patriots balls at halftime were within the range you would expect, all environmental factor considered, and no deflation took place.  If you do not accept his testimony then there is no indication of what the balls started at and so there is no way to calculate an expected range.  The only way that tampering can be implied is by saying that Anderson told the truth about the PSI and lied about the gauge.  If that is the case then we have an NFL official lying to investigators.  If that is not the case then there is no indication of tampering in the first place and, well, there is nothing to be lied about."
nyjets,35pbsf,DoritoSlayer,3,Tue May 12 20:11:43 2015 UTC,"Or the fact that McNally refered to himself as the deflator before this season even started. Implying that he has had a history of deflating footballs. There was also a report in the Wells report that McNally was busted in 2004 sneaking practice balls into the game and had no excuse for how it could have happened, the Patriots were warned at that point that they would be punished if anything similar happened, if you ask me, sneaking in unapproved balls, and tampering with already approved balls, is pretty much the same thing. Also the fact that Brady was behind the 2006 rule change that made it so each team provided it's own footballs."
nyjets,35pbsf,HaruSoul,2,Tue May 12 20:25:00 2015 UTC,"These are all points that could possibly be used to establish a preponderance of evidence claim against the patriots if deflation were shown to have occurred.  The testimony gathered by the Wells Report says that, per the ref in charge, there was no intentional deflation.    The 'deflator' nickname, as best we can tell form the evidence in the report, appears to have originated from a game that The Pats and Jets played earlier in 2014.  In that game it is indicated that the refs inflated the balls illegally to 16psi, prompting Brady to initially yell at his the equipment staff, and then upon learning it was the NFL official's who illegally inflated them to have his equipment staff educate the refs on the legal PSI and instruct them to leave his balls at 12.6.  This is the only time the report indicates Brady comments on PSI levels, and it is to ensure they are legal.  The text messages from there are clearly of two co-workers bitching about a boss that has come down hard on them.  Re-read the entire exchange and you can see that Brady is now being a hard-ass about ball pressure being correct and ""not getting towards the upper limit of legal ever again"".  As indicated in the report, Brady liked his balls prepped at the lower end of the legal range.  When read in that context there is no indication that anything nefarious is going on after the refs check balls.  It is only if you are assuming that tampering occurred that you could make the assumption he is referring to having a role in doing so.  According to the report's direct testimony there is no indication that tampering occurred so the text messages would be interpreted in the more reasonable manner just presented.  EDIT: Redacted a section indicating the origin of the nickname.  The remainder of the graf is still relevant to the context of the text messages."
nyjets,35pbsf,DoritoSlayer,2,Tue May 12 20:45:11 2015 UTC,"The text message where McNally referred to himself as the deflator was from May 2014, before this season even started. It had nothing to do with the Jets game this season."
nyjets,35pbsf,HaruSoul,2,Tue May 12 21:04:56 2015 UTC,"I apologize for that.  Early articles placed them immediately after the Jets game in the timeline and I forgot that they were actually dated earlier in the report.  I will redact that section.  So, yes you are correct that we do not actually know the origin of the nickname, but that alone is certainly not indication of illegal tampering of PSI during games and comes nowhere close to the standard of probability set forth, particularly with the lack of evidence that any illegal tampering ever occurred in the first place.  The timing does shed some light on why Brady got so angry at the Jets game, however, as it shows that the equipment staff had over inflated his balls previously (though if this was at practice or pre-game or whenever we have no indication)"
nyjets,35pbsf,DoritoSlayer,2,Tue May 12 22:07:20 2015 UTC,"I apologize for that.

nyjets,35pbsf,DoritoSlayer,2,Tue May 12 22:07:27 2015 UTC,"I know I'm biased but I'm looking at the big picture. I think the Colts game is irrelevant to the whole situation. Based on the points I made to you, and a few others, I personally believe that this has been going on for an extended period of time. Judging by the punishment the league handed out, I'm assuming that they believe the same thing."
nyjets,35pbsf,HaruSoul,2,Tue May 12 21:51:30 2015 UTC,"The first question we need to answer is 'did intentional illegal PSI manipulation occur'.  If it did not then no other conjecture is relevant or applicable. So far absolutely no evidence shows that it did in the AFCCG, and the only testimony used to indicate it did in reality claims that no tampering occurred.  This leaves the only open accusation of intentional PSI manipulation in the Wells Report squarely against the league officials during the Jets game, and accusations of league negligence on the issue of PSI in many other places.  It really is a bizarre report/situation"

nyjets,35oi6n,Grimlokh,1 point,Tue May 12 14:27:40 2015 UTC,The NFL will likely only reduce the suspension if he goves up his phone and emails that pertain to the deflation. Goodell may still change the amount.
nyjets,35oi6n,NotAModBro,-3,Tue May 12 14:09:47 2015 UTC,"No, if he brings them to court then the phone gets brought out of Toms pocket. But an appeal just goes to a retired judge who looks at whats already on the table. He doesn't take in any new evidence for the appeal. He will still get a suspension, which he should if he knew anything about it. Like I told others. His stats are unbelievable similar on the road and away and the home games are where you get to mess with the balls. Regardless if he has statistically done better with other teams balls ( which he has ) its still a rule that was broken."
nyjets,35oi6n,Grimlokh,2,Tue May 12 14:13:41 2015 UTC,"Brady will NOT bring them to court. It wont happen. He would lose his posterboy status and be punished for every little thing after that.   Also, the courts would rule he obstructed the investigation process, would take in new evidence (likely seizing his phone records) and possibly ending up with grounds for a ""fraud"" charge. They would not be able  to rule on his suspension, because that is a league issue.

Because most of the time people will always say the older athlete was better. Just like Babe Ruth and Micky Mantle are the best players there ever was. And no one else will ever be better.   The fact is the top players now, in most sports, are definitely way better than the players from decades ago. Unfortunately people cant stop looking through their rose colored goggles."

As I stated above, the fact that this sort of ball manipulation was kept a secret by Brady leads me to believe it offered a competitive advantage. Why would Brady legally lobby to have the visiting team handle the balls only to covertly break rules relating to balls years later? It just makes no sense at all. Unless Brady comes out and clears the air, I'll always have my suspicions that he wanted to gain an advantage over it. 4 game suspension here is more than fair.

It is not as iff the refs all give the balls to them with enough time to go to the bathroom and let the air out. Anyone who says that a guy calling himself the deflator and made jokes about reporting what he was doing to ESPN was not deflating the balls is an idiot.  Also if the balls were 16 psi where is the complaint that they filed with the league?
nyjets,35o6uc,Cletus_Van_Dam,1 point,Thu May 14 00:09:22 2015 UTC,"I think they tampered with the balls. I think it's widespread in the NFL and has never been a big deal until Brady got ""caught"".

I bet Aaron Rodgers is pissed because now he won't be able to sneak over-inflated balls past the ref."
nyjets,35o6uc,wcstyles,0,Thu May 14 00:30:42 2015 UTC,"According to the Wells Report, a letter from then-NFL director of game operations Peter Hadhazy dated Nov. 2, 2004 said the incident involved New England ball boys relaying “non-approved practice balls to a game official” during an Oct. 25, 2004 regular-season game. (There actually was no game that day, but the Patriots did beat the New York Jets 13-7 on Oct. 24.)    The Wells Report stated McNally, referred to as “James McNulty” in the letter, was described as the person “in charge of the game day footballs” for the Patriots. He also was the team’s equipment manager at the time and chalked the incident up to “just an honest mistake,” per the report.    But Hadhazy wrote in a letter that the Patriots failed to provide a reasonable explanation for the incident and warned the team could face disciplinary action “if a similar incident occurred in the future because it could be interpreted as a competitive violation,” according to the report."

nyjets,35o6uc,ben1204,3,Tue May 12 07:30:32 2015 UTC,"You were making good points until you started assuming things.  You can't assume the league would agree to anything.  Regardless of this, he broke a rule.  Most people who are on Tom Brady's side will argue that the infraction is violation of the Equipment Standard Rule, which should levy a $25,000 fine.  And they would have a point, IF, Tom Terrific tried to float under inflated balls past the referees and failed.  The issue is that he would bring the referees properly inflated balls, have them checked and signed off on, and then release some air.  This changes the definition of what he is actually doing quite a bit.  No longer is he trying to get an edge by attempting to skate something by the officials, he is now setting up a system in which he intentionally dupes the officials into thinking he is playing by the rules, when in reality he is not.    Secondly, the sheer level of separation the Patriots have in regards to fumbles/interceptions per snap against the league average is staggering.  For people to assume that this infraction has nothing to do with their current success is asinine.  How many games have they lost by under 3 points?  Now bring their fumble/interception to snap ratio down to just above the league average and tell me that they wouldn't have lost a myriad of other games, including playoff games and potentially superbowls.  That my friends is the definition of a MAJOR infraction.  That is cheating.  That is intentionally duping referees to gain an unfair advantage.    Thirdly, It's my contention that Brady could have avoided all of this if he just fessed up immediately and acted like it was no big deal but he didn't and he is being punished accordingly.  If he would have came out after the Colts game and said, I didn't realize this was as big of a problem as everyone is making it out to be.  It was my understanding that most QB's try to manipulate the ball a little to their liking, my bad.  The league probably would have slapped him on the wrist and everyone would have moved on a long time ago.  He thought he would get away with it and he lied and acted like a buffoon and in the process, intentionally or not, made the NFL look silly, with that whole, Balls press conference.  Now they've got to save face and tarnish his, which make no mistake about it, it should be tarnished."

What concerns me is that you can't line up at OLB and be numbered in the 60's, so it could (theoretically) effect how he is deployed on exotic blitz packages.

Vincent goes on detailing how McNally was not made available for requested interviews by the team and Brady straight up refused to hand over texts and e-mails despite having assurances his personal information would be protected. the letter specifically states, ""...it is significant that key witnesses -- Mr. Brady, Mr. Jastremski, and Mr. McNally -- were not fully candid during the investigation"". oh, and all parties were warned in advance that their lack of cooperation would be held against them.   so please put down that crutch of ""popularity"" as unfair target on your back. don't delude yourself into thinking that somehow there is some NFL conspiracy against the team because of your success. the team cheated (again), got caught (again), and then lied about it to the NFL. that's why the punishment is so harsh."

nyjets,35n74t,RossTempleton,23,Mon May 11 23:17:13 2015 UTC,"Oh god!  You mean nobody specifically said ""we better deflate these balls under the legal limit!""  I guess they're not guilty! All is good! The Patriots didn't do anything wrong at all!  Lol"
nyjets,35n74t,nyj87,6,Mon May 11 23:32:37 2015 UTC,You probably also believe Bill had no clue about the balls being deflated. Bill who is known as a control freak and knows his QB for years has no clue about him asking them to deflate footballs.

nyjets,35n74t,RossTempleton,2,Mon May 11 23:49:09 2015 UTC,It found no evidence they knew. Doesn't mean they didn't. But Brady was in on it. So you are left to accept the premise that the organization knew but it can't be proved. Or the organization showed extreme ignorance in the activities of its QB and two low level employees. If they didn't know they def should have. And plus. Bill looks really stupid for not being aware of this. Which he totally did. If you think he didn't I have a bridge I can sell you. Better to look dumb than be guilty I guess.

nyjets,35n74t,Amoress,6,Mon May 11 22:27:17 2015 UTC,"But the report was clear on exonerating the organization, with that in mind I don't think it warrants the loss of a 1st rounder.   That doesn't matter. You are responsible for your employees. If they do not follow the rules, you are responsible. Brady is a member of the Patriots. The Patriots lose draft picks. That is perfectly reasonable. They did not target the owner or coaches personally for that reason."

nyjets,35q2cm,par016,-1,Wed May 13 01:04:02 2015 UTC,Yeah at least bring up the text messages. There's more than enough damning information here to build a case.
nyjets,35q2cm,sugar_free_haribo,4,Wed May 13 05:31:15 2015 UTC,"Your paper needs to print a few corrections.   In 2007, “SpyGate” rocked the Patriots when they were caught illegally videotaping New York Jets coaches’ during their practices.   They were taping defensive signals during games, not practices.   Not only have the Patriots illegally tampered with game balls used in their second-most important game of the season, but they have constantly lied about it.   The tampering is still only alleged, yet you seem to be asserting as fact that it took place. Not clear from context that you are merely positing their guilt, if that's indeed what you intended. Most professors would see this as journalistically unethical. NYT would probably issue a clarification here rather than an outright correction.   In a January 22 press conference, Bill Belichick additionally commented on how each quarterback, punter and kicker has their preference of how the ball feels when they throw or kick it, yet Brady denies altering game balls.  Belichick saying this completely contradicts Brady’s allegation that he doesn’t alter balls. Didn’t Brady say that he “didn’t alter the ball in any way”? Why would Belichick say that every quarterback and specialist has their preference of how they like the ball if Brady doesn’t “alter the ball in any way”? Belichick either didn’t know what was really going on with his team or he lied to cover the wrongdoings of his team.   This is what Brady said in the Jan. 22 press conference:   Q: When and how did you supposedly alter the balls?  TB: I didn’t have any – I didn’t alter the ball in any way. I have a process that I go through before every game where I go in and I pick the footballs that I want to use for the game. Our equipment guys do a great job of breaking the balls in. they have a process that they go through. [...] It was the same process that I always go through.   Brady never denied that he is involved with preparing balls prior to when they are submitted to refs. It could not be more clear from context that he was being questioned about altering the balls after inspection."

nyjets,35ncgg,kanst,2,Tue May 12 11:59:51 2015 UTC,That is not what the report says.  Also the Organization is responsible for the actions of its employees.  Legally the concept is known as Respondeat Superior liability.  Also the Patriots are repeat offenders who were warned in 2008 not to fck up again after they admitted liability for spygate.  Hence the 1st rd pick.

Had they fully complied with the investigation and been honest you'd be looking at Atlanta Falcons-like penalties. (5th rounder and a smaller fine)  Instead Tom Brady has a press conference were he lies about not knowing the guys and laughs it off like the whole thing is ridiculous.

Basically the NFL felt that none of them were forthcoming or believable in their testimony.  Seriously, the Patriots refusal to let the NFL further question McNally is a red flag. Brady's refusal to give text and email doc's is a red flag.    As if they could just shrug their shoulders and give simplistic fickle answers to serious questions about text msg's, taking balls from ref's room without permission, documented drop in psi only to Pats balls, etc,  is a gigantic fuck you to the NFL considering the weight and nature of the evidence against them."

Seems like they give a fuck here, the same shit would have gone down regardless of the team and if this would have been the Jets, I'm sure you guys would have been having a good old laugh (especially as self guided balls couldn't help Geno last season.)   Aaron Rodgers openly disclosing that he likes to overinflate past the PSI limit. Brad Johnson paid people to do it in the Super Bowl, admitted it, and is the NFL going to strip him of his title like many are suggesting? No.    So you want them to go into the records and amend the results/turn over titles due to this?? Simple straw man here, no-one is asking for the Lombardi to be taken from you for the last season, if your saying that's what should happen then....  And honestly you sound like little kids with this argument, when you get caught just hold your hands up don't start screaming 'WELL ALL THE COOL KIDS ARE DOING IT'  doesn't make what happened any better.   Were being treated differently because weve kicked each and every ass in this league.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr_complex"

nyjets,35ncgg,mikerhoa,3,Wed May 13 18:10:52 2015 UTC,Because they're repeat offenders and they have a track record of lying. That's why.
nyjets,35ncgg,bushhooker,-5,Tue May 12 12:36:24 2015 UTC,Can I get a rule number on that one?? Seems a bit emotional even for the NFL.
nyjets,35ncgg,ocyries,3,Tue May 12 12:44:22 2015 UTC,"Not sure if trolling.  You do realize the punishments are discretionary, right? Past history, recidivism, and overall attitude of the organization will be taken into account?  That's why you don't curse your judge out before sentencing..."

nyjets,35nfas,ben1204,3,Tue May 12 01:21:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Same thing I hate about Saints fans who pretend to think Sean Payton had zero idea about bountygate. Of course he knew to some extent. Same thing with Joe Paterno and Jerry Sandusky. Head coaches will always know about controversies in their own locker rooms but they'd rather not deal with it or pretend it doesn't exist if they're winning. The draft picks deduction seems fair when Robert Kraft promised that the Patriots organization didn't cheat and tried to get the NFL to apologize before the investigation was over.   With that being side, I still say fuck Roger Goodell for being a hypocritical piece of shit."
nyjets,35nfas,strifeblood,3,Tue May 12 05:37:35 2015 UTC,fuck Roger Goodell for being a hypocritical piece of shit.    The sentiment that will truly bring all NFL fans together.

nyjets,35nfas,rarelyserious,15,Mon May 11 22:58:25 2015 UTC,thats spot on. patriot fans are in for a shock when BB and brady retire. i doubt theyll have any interest in football after that
nyjets,35nfas,Rutawitz,7,Tue May 12 04:16:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, they will. They'll just hop on to the next bandwagon. Most likely looking like the Seahawks."

Luck has and will probably continue to carry a Colts team that, imo, is pretty bad except for him. The Colts organization can fuck up everything for years to come, but they'll still get 10+ wins as long as they have the Neard."

nyjets,35nfas,sameolejets,1 point,Tue May 12 07:35:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know, the Seahawks look built for success. They had the 7th youngest roster last year and barring Wilson screwing them over with a mega contract that forces key defensive players out, they look like championship contenders the next 3 to 5 years easily. I could see bandwagon Steelers fans returning if they retool, but I don't think the Ravens ever had a huge bandwagon."
nyjets,35nfas,strifeblood,1 point,Tue May 12 07:46:58 2015 UTC,"No, the Ravens bandwagon was limited to Baltimore, and the colleges of their respective superstars.

nyjets,35nfas,NotAModBro,2,Tue May 12 16:32:23 2015 UTC,of course theyve had a huge fanbase. the boston area loves their sports as do the new york/new jersey area. but they will lose a lot of fans that only started paying attention after 2001
nyjets,35nfas,Rutawitz,0,Tue May 12 17:13:07 2015 UTC,Well fuck those ones. I have been a fan for 25 years. I also don't believe the pats will be as bad as people think just because BB and Brady go at some point. I also don't see BB leaving just because Brady does when ever that may be.

nyjets,35r9gi,mrpapadopolous,3,Tue May 12 21:17:34 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: The tuck rule was first called against the Patriots during the Pats/Jets game in week 2 of the 2001 NFL season. The Jets were the lucky recipient of the called-back fumble and went on to tie the game on that very drive, and then went on to win the game in overtime.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuck_rule#Jets_vs._Patriots_.282001.29   Patriots head coach Bill Belichick referred to this game after the subsequent Tuck Rule Game, telling ESPN, ""I knew what the ruling should have been because we had dealt with that play a little bit earlier in the year on the other side of it.""   So thank you Jets, for setting a precedent which helped Tom Brady win his first of four (4) Super Bowls. Couldn't have done it without you."

I think he needs to sit and learn for a year but im on the fence about him long term.  Like they said it took a while before he could earn the starting role at Baylor because of RGIII and Florence. Hes Unproven which makes his potential unknown.   He put up some good numbers in school so we'll see.
nyjets,35md2t,BigDamnSnacks,2,Mon May 11 18:48:33 2015 UTC,"Watched Bryce play a lot at Baylor, here's agood video that talks about Bryce up to this point includes his own family and high school coach, so I understand that the opinions are a little biased. I really like when they talk about how many years he had to wait and struggle to get the starting job at Baylor, but when he did he took the ball and ran with it, his stats are Madden like. He's got a huge throwing arm, tough, and seems to be an honorable man. If he ditches the rookie mentality and goes out with the attitude of taking somebody's job and gets that mean streak, the sky is limitless. Would really enjoy seeing an anti Joe Namath who could care less about the media."

Most O-lines have one guy who will make calls before the snap that the other players will react to. He consistently does this well.  2) He is good at run blocking and pass protection. He has taken on players like Wilfork, Ngata, and Suh, and has generally done a very good job. Being able to control other teams defensive superstars is an un-measurable asset.  3) In the few games he has missed, we crumbled. I can't remember the year (it was like Rex's first or second year) but he went out and the running game stopped. Our o-line became very bad, and when he came back it was like nothing ever happened and they became good again."
nyjets,35jd6m,DougDimmadome44,22,Mon May 11 00:25:18 2015 UTC,Colin Baxter ruined Sanchez's career
nyjets,35jd6m,Shrimpola_Cola,7,Mon May 11 01:21:17 2015 UTC,So true. He had zero time and clearly got gun shy afterwards.
nyjets,35jd6m,Totally_PJ_Soles,4,Mon May 11 02:52:42 2015 UTC,"Yup. Year 3 vs Ravens. Up until then he was doing better than Eli's first 2 years. Then Baxter comes in and Sanchez is eaten alive by the Ravens. Ended up with a pinched nerve that year and played through it although it took away one of his strengths, downfield passing. His weakness was always the short passes and once his downfield passing tanked, so did the team. It all came apart during the Giants game. Heartbreaking to watch that season after so much potential in him. Plaxico being his WR really hurt too."
nyjets,35jd6m,woodyreturns,3,Mon May 11 13:28:42 2015 UTC,"There's a reason why since he was drafted, the run offense has been so effective. He really is able to take players that are known to stuff the run up the middle and shut them down. Having a center than can open up runs through the A-gap lets a team really pound away in the run game with 4-5 yard rushes consistently."

I recognize Mangold is a beast and one of the best centers in the NFL, but he constantly reminds me that Mawae is no longer around :(  To help you out, I think one of the things that makes Mangold the best is his power and smarts.  Basically, he is able to identify the scheme of the defense and lock and drive his defender."
nyjets,35jd6m,donat28,5,Mon May 11 06:59:05 2015 UTC,"Mawae was awesome especially at pulling but Mangold is better at the point of attack. To answer the original posters question go back to when mangold was a draft prospect, there aren't many centers who are legit 6'4"" and 310. He's got 30 pounds on Mawae. Most centers are a little smaller. Most guys are either good at pass blocking or run blocking. He can do both. Mangold can get to the second level. He's got a rare set of physical skills."

nyjets,35hlc3,mydrumluck,8,Sun May 10 14:08:23 2015 UTC,"Some people keep talking about replacing Mo with Williams as if we can't utilize all these guys at one time or it will not be worth the cost. One of the best ways to win in football is to be able to do something that no one can stop, even if they know it is coming.  Mike Westhoff shows just one example of what we can do with if we keep everyone, I do not know how you stop this.  http://thejetsblog.com/nyjets/jets-nation-mike-westhoff-goes-to-the-board/  Also here is a nice article showing why we can afford to keep everyone.  http://www.ganggreennation.com/2015/5/9/8577123/a-word-about-paying-both-muhammad-wilkerson-and-sheldon-richardson"
nyjets,35hlc3,games456,8,Sun May 10 15:57:48 2015 UTC,We can franchise Mo after 2015. It'll cost us $12M. It's not cheap but it's an option. Letting him walk in FA is not.

nyjets,35hlc3,lilphil240,6,Sun May 10 16:04:36 2015 UTC,That could create a Jimmy Graham TE/WR situation. I think Newyorkjets.com roster has him as DL not DE or DT so who knows they might try it but Wilkerson will no doubt appeal to the NFL and say he's a DE.
nyjets,35hlc3,ThreeCranes,2,Sun May 10 16:09:51 2015 UTC,He's not a de. He's a dt. It comes down to the percentage of snaps played at the position.
nyjets,35hlc3,LennyLongshoes,4,Sun May 10 17:46:41 2015 UTC,No it does not. Jimmy Graham played a higher percentage of his plays split out than as an on the line tight end and the NFL still sided with the Saints saying he was a tight end.
nyjets,35hlc3,TheHeartTreeSeesAll,4,Sun May 10 23:58:34 2015 UTC,"Wilkerson is not going anywhere IMO. This is the perfect scenario to keep teams guessing on how the D is going to really look, and even though we'll soon know, any type of smoke screens help at this moment, especially considering teams are scrambling to nail down rosters."
nyjets,35hlc3,CptMurphy,1 point,Sun May 10 15:57:15 2015 UTC,It doesn't hurt to have options in negotiations too. Williams falling to us really really hurt Mo's leverage. I think you can expect a 1 year deal and probably FT on him after unless Wilkerson's camp play D. Revis level hardball. I get that a trade makes sense but you need to see Williams on the field before you pen him in as Mo's replacement.
nyjets,35hlc3,xmarcs,3,Sun May 10 21:56:55 2015 UTC,"I kind of have to agree with Kevin. We aren't going to give the Wilkerson camp elite money that they will want (note this not to say that Wilkerson doesn't deserve it) while we have another elite defensive end and a top six defensive end. I'd much rather see Wilkerson traded and get something for him than to see him walk in free agency.Wilkerson is an obvious fan favorite and I get that it's hard to move on from him, but I'd rather potentially save lots cap and even get a first rounder out of it."

nyjets,35k576,elephantbuddy,2,Mon May 11 14:32:27 2015 UTC,"Size is one aspect.  It's a lot easier to move a 315lb person than it is a 350lb one to open up holes in the run game.  Also playing a 0 tech NT is a lot different from playing a 3 tech DT/DE in terms of reads and responsibilities.  This isn't as big of a deal, as it's coachable, but there would certainly be an adjustment period if we took one of our pass rushers and used him primarily to stop the run."

Football outsiders has the line at 22 in pass protection because their formula heavily relies on sacks. Which the line got charged with when Geno held the ball too long.   https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2015/01/08/2014-pff-offensive-line-rankings/3/  http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/ol
nyjets,35h896,frexistential,3,Sun May 10 10:53:06 2015 UTC,"This.  I think receivers having difficulty getting open and Geno holding the ball too long made our average oline look really bad.  I do think we need to start reinvesting in the oline soon but we should manage.  Remember, we ran the ball pretty well for the most part, and that's due to their blocking as well.  Also afc east d-lines are way above average in the league, which will bring the numbers down."
nyjets,35h896,John_YJKR,3,Sun May 10 12:27:11 2015 UTC,For sure. We got a vet depth piece and a rookie this draft. We should be looking to add more guys next draft. I think the oline will be fine but I am concerned about Mangold.  The guy has been a tank for us but age makes injury more likely. Who would step up?
nyjets,35h896,games456,5,Sun May 10 12:31:41 2015 UTC,"PFF ranked , Giacomini, Aboushi, and Winters all with minus grades last year. Winters was one of the worst ranked lineman in pass protection in the league last year. That is half your line. The line average is pulled up by Colon, Brick and the Norse God but that is not how a line works in real life. If you have a bad side of the line, it gets exploited.  This year we are going to be better with the addition of Carpenter and I think Aboushi will better with some more experience. He looked better the more reps he got.  As for sacks some people do not realize that Geno was 19th in sacks while being third in under pressure.  When he had the ball for 2.6 seconds or more he was sacked once out of every 11.5 times. He actually got sacked much less than other top QB's. Wilson for example was sacked every 8.2 times he held the ball for 2.6 seconds or more. Geno is actually pretty good at avoiding a sack.  Geno was sacked 15.1% of the times he was under pressure which puts him 15th.  Michael Vick on the other hand got sacked like it was no ones business. Out of 153 drop backs he was sacked a whopping 19 times. Vick was sacked once out of every 8 times he dropped back and was sacked 30.6% of the time he was under pressure. The only person worse than him was Colt McCoy.  We would have actually had a lot less sacks if Geno played the entire season.  Edit - Typo"
nyjets,35h896,John_YJKR,2,Sun May 10 15:43:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for this. My point was that the line gave ample time to whoever was back there. Yes many of them had negative grades but when compared to other lines they failed well in pass protection. Geno is quick so Geno avoided some of those sacks but he needs to identify his targets and get the ball to them more quickly.
nyjets,35h896,games456,2,Sun May 10 22:49:39 2015 UTC,"You are not understanding the data correctly. Geno avoided sacks not because of the line, but because of his escape ability. You need to look no further than what happened to Vick behind that line. He got sacked like crazy since he can't escape like he used to. If Vick played the entire season he would have lead the league in sacks by a large margin. You think the line just was bad just when Vick was in?  Russell Wilson took longer to to throw than Geno Smith and you will not hear anyone say that Seattle had a good line in front of him. He had time to throw because of his ability to get out of the pocket and avoid the sack, just like Geno. The have that time despite the line, not because of it."
nyjets,35h896,bit99,1 point,Mon May 11 01:00:31 2015 UTC,"Through 8 games, Geno Smith was 2nd in the league in time to throw. He was 1st in the league in time to scramble. Source: Bucs.com"
nyjets,35h896,John_YJKR,1 point,Mon May 11 14:04:10 2015 UTC,"I don't see it that way. Yes, Geno is good at escaping. We know both he and Wilson can run. But that does not mean he didn't have plenty of time on most of the snaps. Is there data for amount of time before he was hurried? I watch every game and Geno holds the ball too long more often than not. He has open guys but misses his timing window. That's one of his major issues cause he hasn't adapted to the speed of NFL defenses. Our line is not amazing but it is decent."
nyjets,35h896,games456,1 point,Mon May 11 02:46:07 2015 UTC,"You are wrong. We have the perfect control in Vick. Even though Vick is old he still has a little wiggle. Even with that Vick shows us what it would look like if Geno was not able to get away like he does. If Vick played the entire season he would have had the most sacks in the league by far and your argument about the line would look even more foolish than it does now. This is not an assumption, it is simple math."
nyjets,35h896,John_YJKR,2,Mon May 11 04:51:35 2015 UTC,Calm your tits. It's nothing to start acting like a child over. What we need is an analysis of how much time the line gave our QB to throw.
nyjets,35h896,games456,1 point,Mon May 11 05:29:50 2015 UTC,"My tits very are calm :)    What we need is an analysis of how much time the line gave our QB to throw.    Oh, now we need info. We can't just randomly say shit like the line was great and Geno was the problem? Even though every single person on the planet except for you knows that our line was an issue? That is fine though, half the line was fine, that is all you need. No NFL team will notice the weak side. What fucking joke.  I have my info, Vick, who has legendary escape abilty was sacked more per drop back than any starting caliber QB in the NFL last year behind this line. You have nothing but your repeated incorrect assumptions.  I have my numbers, they are crystal clear. Go get yours instead of acting like a child :)"
nyjets,35h896,John_YJKR,1 point,Mon May 11 06:35:10 2015 UTC,I never said they were great. I said they were avg. PFF has them ranked 13th overall being 19th run blocking and 8th in pass protection.  Football outsiders has the line ranked 20th in run blocking and 22 in pass protection. The big difference is football outsiders pretty much solely considers sack rate for the pass blocking rank. PFF does have time to throw stats but you have to pay to access the 2014 season. I found 2013s and it does support my argument but we aren't discussing the 2013 season. I have posted both links to pff and football outsiders several times before. Of course we need data. Where do you think I'm drawing my conclusions from?  https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2015/01/08/2014-pff-offensive-line-rankings/3/  http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/ol  https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2014/06/16/qbs-in-focus-time-to-throw/
nyjets,35h896,M3nt0R,0,Mon May 11 07:30:23 2015 UTC,Your numbers dont add up.  19 out of 153 is a LOT lower than what you say.  Even if it's not all while under pressure.
nyjets,35h896,games456,1 point,Sun May 10 18:00:18 2015 UTC,What does not add up? PFF has him with 153 drop backs and he was sacked 19 times. 153 divided by 19 is 8.052.
nyjets,35h896,M3nt0R,1 point,Sun May 10 18:07:06 2015 UTC,Isn't that just about what Russel Wilson had?
nyjets,35h896,games456,1 point,Sun May 10 19:04:06 2015 UTC,"Wilson dropped back 514 times and was sacked 39 times so he was sacked every 13.17 drop backs, not even close. He was also only sacked 16.1 % of the time while under pressure compared to Vicks bottom of the league 30.6%.  Vick was horrible."
nyjets,35h896,M3nt0R,1 point,Sun May 10 20:18:21 2015 UTC,"Ah ok.  You got very specific with your stats, the 8.2 was when Wilson had the ball for more than 2.5 seconds or whatnot."
nyjets,35h896,games456,1 point,Sun May 10 20:51:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, 281 dropbacks where he held the ball over 2.6 seconds, 35 sacks so he was sacked every 8.02 times he held it over 2.6 seconds.  Smith 243 dropbacks over 2.6 seconds, 21 sacks so he was sacked every 11.57 times he held it over 2.6 seconds.  Vick, 86 dropbacks over 2.6 seconds, 17 sacks so he was sacked every 5.05 times he held it over 2.6 seconds.  Honestly, every way you look at it Vick was just bad. His major strength of escapability was non existant."
nyjets,35h896,Shadune,1 point,Sun May 10 21:06:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly. For two years we've had an indecisive young QB struggling to learn the system and work at NFL speed. So many of Geno's sacks came after he held the ball way too long.   We definitely need to keep digging for depth and eventually new starters at the tackles, but we've got plenty of young up-and-comers in the middle. Time for some guys to step up."
nyjets,35h896,games456,2,Sun May 10 15:11:25 2015 UTC,Vick actually got sacked way more than Geno did.  Edit- It's true lol
nyjets,35h896,Shadune,3,Sun May 10 15:48:42 2015 UTC,"Vick should be ashamed of his performance last season. Geno is young and learning, Vick just didn't even try."

nyjets,35h896,sameolejets,2,Sun May 10 13:21:40 2015 UTC,"With Winters & Colon starting, it was a boat with gushing holes.  With Carpenter & Aboushi starting, those holes should be plugged.

nyjets,35h896,TheUnApolegist,1 point,Sun May 10 18:45:18 2015 UTC,"Aboushi is actually horrible at pass protection. He got destroyed in two games, and Mangold had to provide support for Aboushi a lot of the time."

The o-line is what it is, and unfortunately, it wasn't MacCagnan's target for aggressive improvement.  My preference would have been to have tried to pick up more OG/OT talent, and not have drafted Petty."
nyjets,35h896,ajn19,1 point,Sun May 10 19:32:50 2015 UTC,I can live with the petty pick but I would have rather they waited until next year to draft a developmental qb when there is much more talent at the position.
nyjets,35h896,sameolejets,1 point,Sun May 10 20:14:23 2015 UTC,"Precisely.  Right now, I question whether Petty can even ""fairly"" unseat Matt Simms as practice QB.  If that is genuinely the case, then its obviously a wasted pick."
nyjets,35h896,TheUnApolegist,1 point,Tue May 12 07:20:56 2015 UTC,"Oh, hell no! I'm just saying that Aboushi is not without his flaws, like being dominated by the swim move. I feel like Aboushi gets a good grade from most of us fans because anything is an improvement over Winters. I like Aboushi, I just think he isn't ready to be a starter quite yet. He is amazing at run blocking, though."
nyjets,35h896,sameolejets,1 point,Sun May 10 23:30:11 2015 UTC,"I like Aboushi, I just think he isn't ready to be a starter quite yet. He is amazing at run blocking, though.   Its hard to define.  There are two major schemes involved with blocking technique.  One is ""one-on-one"", ""react"" zone blocking, and the other is traditional power blocking, with predetermined blocking based on the hole you want to open, and getting additional players to help open the hole.  Its great having an above average run blocker, but not if they don't perform well under the system, or if you're a pass heavy team.  And its not even my intention to knock Aboushi, because he can still improve and defy expectations.  I'm just saying that if Aboushi is a starter, there are better OGs to get or draft.  Last season, I did not consider the Jet o-line stable.  Then how can one ""fairly"" determine if Ferguson did his job, or ""earned"" his premium salary?  (Same for Giacomini.)   We needed better guards not just to improve play, but to ""fairly"" determine the tackles' ""dropoff"" in performance (because they are paid top dollar, and are getting old)."
nyjets,35h896,mydrumluck,3,Tue May 12 07:17:44 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Jets are hoping that Mangold continues to play well, and Brick doesn't fall off too much this year. They are also gonna hope for some improvement from last year's squad."
nyjets,35h896,Fishooked,4,Sun May 10 14:11:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I think people are sugar coating the problem by blaming it on Genoa holding the ball too long. The fact is out pass blocking was pretty bad last year too."
nyjets,35h896,Rugger11,2,Sun May 10 12:35:59 2015 UTC,"I think it really comes down to Brick. If he continues to decline then the lack of talent in the line will become more apparent. If he plays relatively the same as last year(average) then we aren't in the worst shape in the world. We have a ton of guards, so hopefully someone can step up. Interested in seeing how Dozier plays."
nyjets,35h896,sameolejets,1 point,Sun May 10 16:49:13 2015 UTC,"We don't have a ton of guards, since right now Colon & Winter's are our 1st backups.

nyjets,35i62v,AKA_Whatever,2,Mon May 11 04:45:56 2015 UTC,"Marshall and Coles for the combination of physicality and speed.  It's tempting to say Marshall and Keyshawn because they are the two most talented guys on the list, but I feel like putting both of their personalities in the same locker room is a bad idea.  Between the two I like Marshall better because while he has a violative personality, he's not an out and out dick like Keyshawn was as a player.  Marshall has also calmed down quite a bit since he was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and put on the proper meds. I'm also inclined to think that his falling out with Cutler had a lot to do with Cutler generally being a pretty unlikable person (I live in Chicago now, everyone here hates him) and a super inconsistent QB.  Plus Marshall is a great possession and redzone receiver and will battle for every ball thrown his way.  Coles as his wingman because Coles could stretch the field. He wasn't the fasted guy, but in his prime he could burn corners going over the top from time to time. I feel like Coles was a high-end number 2 guy that played on teams expecting him to be WR1. He had a solid career (sadly a lot of his best years were with Wash) but he never had someone like Marshall lining up opposite him taking up the secondary's attention while he was in his prime. I think it would have allowed him to raise his game up a notch.   Also, the best QBs Coles had throwing to him were Pennington and one season of an end of his career Brett Farve while Decker (my other consideration for #2) had Manning throwing to him for two seasons, so I weigh give Cole's resume more weight.  Love Chrebet of course. He was a great route runner and had great hands, but he did not have nearly the size nor the speed as the other guys on the list."

nyjets,35e84c,Urethra2Xtreme,14,Sun May 10 13:13:59 2015 UTC,No ones questioning his smartness Marshall his decision making and accuracy are off the charts bad. There has to be something done or he's losing his job to Fitz or Petty.  I hope Marshall doesn't get too attached.
nyjets,35e84c,tgrabowy717,43,Sat May 9 14:12:38 2015 UTC,There's almost no chance Petty takes his job. I would be surprised if Petty ever starts in the NFL
nyjets,35e84c,tgrabowy717,15,Sat May 9 14:30:19 2015 UTC,"i wouldn't be surprised if he started. McElroy started a game for us once. Plus Bowles comes from the Cardinals, they are actually genuine about seeing what they have in their QBs on gameday. I givr it a season before he hits the field with the 1st string offense"
nyjets,35e84c,CosmicWy,15,Sat May 9 15:16:38 2015 UTC,I meant it more as a consistent starter not a spot starter type player like McElroy.   And if Petty is the first team starter in a year than something went very wrong
nyjets,35e84c,CosmicWy,1 point,Sat May 9 16:43:42 2015 UTC,"The reason I say that is because I'm assuming Geno is still Geno this year, in which case it'd be reasonable to see what Petty has before we either turn to a rookie we draft in 2016, or prepare to draft a new rookie QB in 2017."
nyjets,35e84c,domsanti,1 point,Sat May 9 17:21:05 2015 UTC,"go back and look at how many 4th rounders make it to starting spots on merit, tjen keep them.  Bryce has the physical abiloty, but ive been reading very low skill grades which make me think hes a career backup.  Id give him a few seasons before he hits the field as a second string QB."
nyjets,35e84c,Capon3,2,Sat May 9 17:23:04 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah no question he is likely a career backup. Doesn't mean he won't see the field if Geno plays poorly in 2016 though, because lets be realistic, if Geno is even as ""good"" as slightly below average this year, people next year will still say things like, ""We still need to see what Geno has while he's on his rookie contract, he has all the physical tools!"""
nyjets,35e84c,MongoJazzy,3,Sat May 9 17:27:01 2015 UTC,"i think thats reasonable still.  putting petty on the field would (in any scenario i can think of) would be worse than geno.  He's obviously better than a Logan Thomas, but Bryce is a lottery ticket.  Geno is a coin flip."
nyjets,35e84c,tgrabowy717,2,Sat May 9 17:32:09 2015 UTC,"Anything could happen if he shows up big in preseason. But I highly doubt he will do anything big enough to make him close to being a starter. Just saying, anything could happen."
nyjets,35e84c,tgrabowy717,1 point,Sat May 9 14:54:03 2015 UTC,"The only way he's starting is if he's better then Geno. You have to figure he's not, yet.. Geno for all his faults is better then I rook would be. Best thing for the Jets this season and moving forward is to have Geno at the helm and Petty learn. Maybe mid next year or 2 years down the line Petty is ready."
nyjets,35e84c,MongoJazzy,1 point,Sat May 9 17:14:33 2015 UTC,Petty is a better QB than you think he is and he has a lot of potential if he works hard.  You might wind up being very pleasantly surprised.
nyjets,35e84c,tgrabowy717,3,Sat May 9 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"I've seen more than enough of him from his game tape at Baylor and the stories about him to know what I'm talking about. In my opinion, the 3 most important traits for a QB going to the NFL to have are intelligence, accuracy, and work ethic. He never learned a  full playbook at Baylor and he was a JUCO kid out of high school (he didn't qualify academically), and he had incredibly poor accuracy with pro style concepts at Baylor. Don't know enough about his work ethic to comment. IMO, he is years away from starting and even then he'd have to have an incredible work ethic to be a serviceable starter. He's decently athletic, but he's less athletic than geno, there's no way he can lean on that trait in the NFL"
nyjets,35e84c,MongoJazzy,5,Sat May 9 16:41:55 2015 UTC,"Is it really fair to say a JUCO kid isn't intelligent? I know first hand that if you're too passionate about something, you may end up letting your grades slip because you just don't care about some numbers on a report card. Most football players don't care about their grades. Besides, Aaron Rodgers went to JUCO, we don't know if Petty's grades were low or if he was poorly scouted as well.   Note: just because Aaron Rodgers was mentioned does not mean Aaron Rodgers is in any way comparable to Petty in skill, because I know someone would bring it up"
nyjets,35e84c,tgrabowy717,1 point,Sat May 9 17:24:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't been able to find the reasons behind his JUCO career, as I suppose he could have went there due to not getting the offer he wanted. However that was more of a secondary point on his mental game. A lack of a college playbook and no experience in a pro style system puts him years behind mentally"
nyjets,35e84c,MongoJazzy,1 point,Sat May 9 17:38:22 2015 UTC,"Okay. I have also looked at his game tape and In my opinion Petty has the potential to develop into a good starting QB in the NFL.  He has excellent arm strength, he is a very good leader on the field and he is a winner.  Also I think you are dead wrong on his intelligence.  He scored a 31 on the Wonderlic which is pretty good.  Feel free to trash the guy before he has even had a chance to develop his skills into an NFL caliber QB - but I think your assessment is inaccurate, premature and a bit unfair / harsh."
nyjets,35e84c,matap821,1 point,Sat May 9 17:21:00 2015 UTC,"Wonderlic doesn't really mean anything for football intelligence. He hasn't learned a playbook and he didn't run a pro style offense. Also you can't just watch tape in an hour and expect to know everything about a prospect. I've seen all his games and I can tell you accuracy is an enormous issue for him, and accuracy is the toughest thing to correct in a QB.   There is no such thing as too harsh of a scouting report, especially one rooted in fact. It's a tough transition from college to NFL, so all possible issues with a players game and personality must be considered. All of the things I've mentioned were common talking points for Petty in scouting circles"
nyjets,35e84c,mwax321,2,Sat May 9 17:30:30 2015 UTC,"Okay Nothing matters if it indicates that you are totally wrong in your attack on Bryce Petty's intelligence.  BTW HC Bowles just called Bryce ""Very Smart"" and ""Very football smart"".  But I guess according to you Coach Bowles is wrong and has no idea what he is talking about...   Are you a NFL scout or do you just play one on Reddit?   If you want to trash our rookie QB before he even has an opportunity to develop as an NFL QB, that's up to you.  As for myself I'm rooting for this kid and based on what I've seen and heard he has a very good shot at becoming a good NFL QB."
nyjets,35e84c,Iwillthinkofonelater,1 point,Sat May 9 17:44:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not a pro scout. I'm amateur. I've read guides on how to do it, watched videos of pros breaking tape down, and taken my own football experience into my scouting. I do it for fun.   And I'm not trying to trash petty, I'm just being realistic. People are ready to anoint petty as the chosen one, but there are numerous reasons why he was available in the fourth. Not to say he has no positives, there are things about his game that I like, but people need to slow down with petty"
nyjets,35e84c,enjoyyoself,0,Sat May 9 19:01:50 2015 UTC,How slow do we need to go?  I think he's a good prospect w/alot of upside and potential.  I don't hear anybody declaring him a Day 1 starter.   Is it okay w/you if I think he might be a god NFL qb?
nyjets,35e84c,Firefoxz99,8,Mon May 11 11:52:32 2015 UTC,"From what I've read under the system Mornhingweg had, Geno didn't have much room for decision making. There were no audibles, and he was told what receiver he had to throw to. It looked like he could change the formation a bit, but as we saw in the Green Bay game, Marty wasn't even willing to trust the QB to do that as he tried to call a time out (while Geno was making the correct adjustment) and ruined a game that might have been a huge momentum swing for our team last year. Geno may not have what it takes to be a starter, but unfortunately we are too far from knowing that yet."

He is terrible with the football as far as turning it over goes, he does not make the right reads and hasn't developed into the qb we hoped for. ""super duper smart""  are you kidding me? The guy has shown nothing of growth on the football field from an intelligence perspective, does he have a ton of athletic ability? Sure he does but other than that what has he done? out of 30 career starts he has had maybe 8 where you can say he wasn't too bad."
nyjets,35e84c,ZedSpot,9,Sat May 9 16:11:17 2015 UTC,Because Geno pretty much has to improve this year.

Are you suggesting that just because he wasn't able to make the leap in his second year, he has no shot his third year? For God's Sake, have some faith. We're giving him an offense that Mark Sanchez could only have dreamed about when he was in New York. We got our number 1 WR offering to take Geno under his wing. If that says something, it says that we should be behind him as much as Marshall is."

He's my vote for #5.   Owusu, Posey and Enunwa battle it out for #6.  Nobody actually knows if any of these guys will step up though so your guess is as good as any.  edit: This is from today's minicamp   Quincy Enunwa doing OK. Enunwa, a wide receiver taken last year in the sixth round who spent all of 2014 on the practice squad, caught pretty much everything thrown his way. It'll be a crowded group of receivers this summer, but Enunwa doesn't figure to go quietly."
nyjets,35g6jg,jetsfan07,2,Sun May 10 01:28:35 2015 UTC,"Also I would like to point out that Shaq Evans is Devin Smith lite. Literally. Watch their college games. Shaq has more return experience, though."
nyjets,35g6jg,jetsfan07,4,Sun May 10 02:28:45 2015 UTC,"I see them keeping Hakim on the roster any way they can. The guy is a speed freak and useful on every facet of the game- he was in an exotic blitz package, ran gunner and kick return, and I believe he was involved with a jet sweep as well. Owusu played fairly well, and his off season workouts are stupid impressive. Has hands, needs more route running practice. I think we have to wait till the preason to get a better idea of what's going on in Bowles head, though."

nyjets,35g6jg,Rugger11,1 point,Sun May 10 03:25:18 2015 UTC,"I think it will be between Evans, Enuwana, Owusu and Posey. I'm only throwing Posey on there because Mac had a hand in him being drafted and made it a point to try and get him in that trade. Evans and Enuwana have upside, just drafted last year, and haven't been able to show what they can do because of IR. Owusu flashed at the end of the season, so throw him into the mix. I don't think Graham, Hakim or Powell are in the mix really. We saw and know what they can do and the first group has more upside. With that first group, at least one of them will stick if they show special team ability. If someone can show that they can be a good returner, you can bet they will be on the team."

Lets be real, the patriots are a better team than us, so anything that handicaps them while we play will be ok by me as long as it was warranted. However, I can see if really intense football fans(not just a fan of their team) could get upset at the fact that Brady might not get to play. I guess it would be similar to how pissed I would get if he somehow doesn't get into the HOF. Not saying it is me, but some people will only be ok with beating them if they are playing at 100%. In my eyes, a win is a win no matter who is playing QB, but there are some people who would genuinely be upset and not like a win like that. All I'd say is don't worry about how some other fans are handling the situation, to each their own.   And hey, with the whole tampering thing, some Pats fans were wanting/expecting a first rounder where as other fans saw the entire thing as the non issue it was.

nyjets,35bqof,Steph360WithTheWrist,3,Sat May 9 16:13:50 2015 UTC,"Cro did a tremendous job in Arizona last year, but nobody points out that he got toasted by fast, all-pro receivers when left vulnerable.  Revis was mental AND speed, and both decline with age.  The Jets payed a shitload of money for a ""gamechanger""; how are they going to feel when Revis plays only ""above average""?  I ""suspect"" the tandem will play to a similar level as in 2010-2011, being aided by a ferocious defensive line.  But I won't be shocked if there is drop off from that time, nor will be surprised when the Jets LB/S core gets roasted by passes to TEs & slot receivers, which all successful teams make an effort to build into their offenses.  Jets pass defense against those targets are nominal at best."
nyjets,35bqof,sameolejets,1 point,Sat May 9 07:09:59 2015 UTC,"I think revis will be great for awhile, cro still has a few years in him. You're also forgetting about buster skrines and dee milliner, I sure playing behind two great corners won't hurt. I don't see how you can call their pass defense nominal, especially after getting gilchrist, now their safeties are playing on the right side. They have pretty good linebackers, so I think the pass d is looking pretty damn awesome."
nyjets,35bqof,byrdmandana,1 point,Sat May 9 23:17:12 2015 UTC,"I don't see how you can call their pass defense nominal, especially after getting gilchrist,    Gilchrist is playing free safety.  They traditionally cover over the cornerbacks, not cover where the linebackers are.  Skrine should be a good slot corner, and milliner will be a question mark (and neither will be on the field unless a linebacker or the strong safety comes out).  Traditionally, linebackers are responsible for the interior pass coverage (when not subbed out), and the Jet LB core is rated nominal, at best, for pass coverage.  This is where OCs send their RBs, TEs, & slot receivers to catch passes, while the WRs run outside that area.  This is where teams like the Patriots feast on our pass defense."

nyjets,35cccf,boredymcbored,7,Sat May 9 22:36:05 2015 UTC,"the key to me is getting Fitzpatrick healthy and acclimated with the first team.  we have actual weapons (Marshall, Decker, Amaro, Kerley, the Ohio St WR...) and a bruising RB.  they can play tight to vest when needed with Ivory and Kerley out of the slot/Amaro on short routes.  then there's the ability to 'surprise' teams and open up.  there is reason to watch, at least.  this division is loaded so it may be tough to get a WC, but they will be significantly better and more fun to watch in 2015 -- even if it only means 7-9, 8-8."
nyjets,35cccf,sameolejets,2,Sat May 9 00:23:24 2015 UTC,"Funny how everyone else in the division got good at the same time. Even with that though, I feel we'll be legit. Fitz is a decent enough player and has more than enough talent around him to get us somewhere great. With a great, healthy defense, I feel like we'll dominate. I just hope the O line is good enough. They're my only question with our wrcore and backfield."
nyjets,35cccf,RodKimble_Stuntman,2,Sat May 9 01:50:19 2015 UTC,"That's why i'm so uncertain as to where we will end up in terms of Wins and Losses or playoffs, because our division improved so much.  I do think though that we finally can play with any team in the NFL so long as we have decent QB play.  It was hard these last few years - I was believing my own lies and was in denial.  This team is forreal and is going to be SO damn fun to watch."
nyjets,35cccf,sameolejets,0,Sat May 9 02:31:03 2015 UTC,"Let me put it to you this way:  On paper, our offense looks f**king scary, if Fitz is the starter.  It would be reminiscent of what the Patriots offense looked like, back in 2009-2011.  The problem is that its only paper."
nyjets,35cccf,RodKimble_Stuntman,3,Sat May 9 07:32:09 2015 UTC,"Are you equating Ryan Fitzpatrick to Tom Brady, because that's insane?"
nyjets,35cccf,escapingNihilism,0,Sat May 9 22:17:32 2015 UTC,"No, but I equate Ryan Fitzpatrick as a QB who can make a correct read, and throw a pass most of the time without getting intercepted.  Its a spread offense, where all of our starting receivers are above average, from behind a o-line that is marginally above average.  The Jets pass offense can resemble a console game, that's how good it potentially is.  Of course, I cannot make that prediction if Geno Smith is starting."
nyjets,35cccf,boredymcbored,0,Sun May 10 18:28:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but the 09-12 Brady-Moss-Welker-Gronk combo is > than  Fitzpatrick-Marshall-Decker-Kerley by a pretty wide margin, even on paper."
nyjets,35cccf,sameolejets,2,Mon May 11 05:58:58 2015 UTC,"yeah, that O-line was what made that 2009 team so dangerous, and allowed the Jets to control the clock via the running game despite the lack of a real deep threat to back defenses off.  I don't see how this OL can be that good."
nyjets,35cccf,games456,2,Sat May 9 03:18:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. People often forget the value of a good line. With one, a team can flourish, even with a medicore qb and OK rb. Have a terrible one and everyone has a bad time, QB especially. We need a solid one to get our average QBs a shot. Without it we might just be turnover city again, even with a good wr core."
nyjets,35cccf,sameolejets,1 point,Sat May 9 04:58:21 2015 UTC,"MacCagnan also appears to have forgotten the importance of a good O-line.  We've only added a FA OG, and a 5th round OG.  (Perhaps MacCagnan has faith in a roster he has barely seen.)   Instead, we got a 4th round QB in the belief he can eventually start, in one of the weakest QB drafts in recent history.  And no indication he can unseat Matt Simms without the fix being in.  Anyone remember Taj Boyd?"
nyjets,35cccf,games456,2,Sat May 9 07:34:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think he forgot it we just had a lot of holes. The line is going to be Brick, Carpenter, Norse God, Aboushi, Giacommini. That will not be the best line in football but it will be OK. We also have some pretty decent depth at the line."
nyjets,35cccf,sameolejets,1 point,Sat May 9 09:09:06 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call Colon & Winters as pretty decent depth, nor any of our backup tackles/C, who's names escape me.  I think its crucial this year that there are no question marks at the guard position, because its the only way to evaluate the tackles and center for drop off."
nyjets,35cccf,RodKimble_Stuntman,1 point,Sun May 10 18:34:33 2015 UTC,"Colon is a much better backup than most teams have. He was also very good in pass protection last year. I am not talking about Williams. I am talking about Dozier who has looked better, Freeman who stepped in for Mangold but could also play guard. Then you have Harrison and and Hooey   I think its crucial this year that there are no question marks at the guard position   Saying stuff like this makes no sense, like you can just go to the store and get 2 top rated guards. Also Mangold just had a probowl year again surrounded by suspect talent. I am not worried about the drop off at center."
nyjets,35cccf,sameolejets,1 point,Sun May 10 20:10:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not remotely worried about Mangold this year.  But perhaps the Jets really need to burn high picks to groom Ferguson and Giacomini's replacements.  Do you pass up on an above average LB or WR/TE/RB for a rookie tackle only about as good as a deteriorated starting tackle?    That's why I said that its important this year to have good guards; to fairly evaluate where Ferguson and Giacomini are at.  (And obviously because an inferior o-line results in inferior offensive performance, regardless of talent elsewhere.)"
nyjets,35cccf,TyBerns,1 point,Tue May 12 07:26:56 2015 UTC,"Our running backs were 4th in the league last year in ypc, a pretty indicative stat towards offensive line run blocking competence. O-line was probably our strongest offensive area last year, and Mac made it immediately better with Carpenter at least.   And Taj Boyd was undrafted (or a 7th-rounder, I can't remember), there's a big difference between a UDFA and a 4th rounder who some draft experts regarded as a first or second round talent before the draft started. Petty's a great value pick if the coaches think he can eventually start."

nyjets,35cccf,John_YJKR,2,Sat May 9 02:32:55 2015 UTC,"The knock on Cro as FS is that Cro has a bad habit of not finishing on tackles, something you don't want out of your ""last"" line of defense.  I don't think Cro has any chance of displacing Gilchrist at the position.

Fitz is rehabbing, Simms is a 3rd stringer at best, and Petty's job is to sit for a year or two and learn. Geno was always going to be getting the 1st team reps, and it was because he's the only healthy QB with live action experience on the roster. And even if Fitz was healthy, Geno would still at least be splitting reps with him because an organization is going to give a young, cheap, physically talented 3rd year QB every chance to succeed. They'd be foolish not to."
nyjets,35a28s,BigNuke43,7,Fri May 8 11:30:25 2015 UTC,No doubt. And I didn't mean to post it as news that Geno will start off with first team reps. But it's an interesting read and also the first time (I think) that Bowles officially calls it a competition.

Everyone knew Geno was going to be a project and it is not as if he has been surrounded by talent either.   I am not saying Geno will surely turn it around but seriously, if Peyton Manning, John Elway, Troy Aikman and many other top QB's were drafted now people would be screaming that they are terrible and they will never be good as their first few seasons were bad to downright aweful."

If you would have walked into this sub at any point in the second half of last year, including week 17, I'm willing to bet you couldn't find a single person who would sign off on him being the starter anymore. At best they were okay with him holding the clipboard. Why? Because we were actually watching him play!  Yet now here we are, with a growing contingent of fans that are firmly back behind Geno. How are our memories so short?  I get that there aren't too many other options out there. But there were a LOT of us who swore ""never again"" after last year's debacle. Now all I'm seeing are rationalizations and ""well if he just changes this..."" and all other manner of nonsense.  Guys, if you ask for more of the same, you get more of the same..."
nyjets,35a28s,bbch1,24,Fri May 8 12:00:31 2015 UTC,"For me a lot of it is the coaching and system change. Geno played under a spread offense at WVU, so I'd like to see what he can do under Chan Gailey's spread-type system. Plus we actually have a talent receiving corps this year, so there are really no more excuses if he can't succeed now."
nyjets,35a28s,bamflax8,3,Fri May 8 12:07:35 2015 UTC,I agree if Geno can't compete with a WR corp like this then he's not even a backup in the league.

Like I always say, if he wins the job no one will cheer harder for him than me.  But after watching him play in what was ostensibly a spread offense last year and botch timing patterns, miss open receivers, lead and lock onto targets, and make just some all around retarded decisions week after week I have some serious doubts as to whether Gailey can coax brilliance from him. And it's not like he had a bunch of slapdicks out there not getting open.  If it happens I will eat my words raw with a side of crow. But, as they say, the past is prologue..."
nyjets,35a28s,papi_chulo83,1 point,Fri May 8 12:12:40 2015 UTC,I think its because we're hoping he can learn in this system and hes the best natural talent we have.

He just needs to put it all together.
nyjets,35a28s,John_YJKR,3,Fri May 8 16:02:16 2015 UTC,We don't need our QB to run though. We need him to make good decisions and take care of the ball. That describes Fitz and not Geno.
nyjets,35a28s,John_YJKR,1 point,Fri May 8 21:23:59 2015 UTC,My problem is that I don't think his issues are completely from a system. The major flaws Geno has are in his head. No system can fix that.

nyjets,35a28s,Zohin,11,Fri May 8 15:20:39 2015 UTC,"Because its a new system and regime, 2 shiny new weapons in Marshall and Smith, ended last season on a high note, a monster defense to back him up, and another year of experience under his belt.   We all WANT Geno to succeed, his ceiling is higher than Fitz, so why not see if he can reach that potential before calling it quits. People need to remember he is still very young so there is a lot of room for improvement. If he steps it up, great! That's what we all hope for. If not, go ahead and bench him, start Fitz, and move on to the Petty era after or start all over with the 2016 QB Draft Class. I think it's silly to just dismiss Geno already after 2 below average seasons and not to continue to develop him...or at least attempt to."
nyjets,35a28s,actofgod22,0,Fri May 8 12:55:27 2015 UTC,"He still fumbles any time you look at him, and gives more shit away than Santa.  We didn't address our O-line (yet), so we can expect another sack-fumble fest this year as well with Geno."
nyjets,35a28s,mikerhoa,7,Fri May 8 13:01:47 2015 UTC,Of note is that emotions were running high during the season. Having time to digest everything could improve our judgement just as easily as forgetting details could undermine it.

nyjets,35a28s,John_YJKR,2,Fri May 8 12:58:27 2015 UTC,it's fun to say this unsubstantiated dream/reality hyperbole rhetoric!  the fact is the jury is not actually out on Geno; what we've currently seen is actually an improvement from year 1 to year 2 (statwise); coaches that are going to tailor an offense to their players - not shoehorn the players into 'their offense'; and actual competition.   To say Geno improving is a dream is not based in reality.  It's a lame prognostication from a man on a computer.  You have no idea how things will turn out and many slices of the geno stat pie can prove either side's argument.
nyjets,35a28s,CosmicWy,2,Fri May 8 17:10:32 2015 UTC,The improvement was marginal. He'd have to make a huge leap in one off season. Its very unlikely and a lot of us rather be surprised than let down if he does or does not make a big enough Improvement. You're right that no one knows the future but the most likely scenario is clear to those mature enough to accept it. Not admitting as much is to be in as much denial as patriot fans are about Brady.
nyjets,35a28s,John_YJKR,1 point,Fri May 8 21:32:18 2015 UTC,"Dude, seriously?  Why do you not know how to have a real discussion with anyone?   me: ""Geno can start over Fitz"" You:  ""you're delusional""   then   Me: ""Geno has the potential for enough growth from year 2 to year 3 for him to be a starting, contributing QB in th NFL"" You: ""Mature people won't accept that""   As i type above... Dude, seriously?  If Geno makes the improvement he made from year-1-to-year-2 this upcoming season, he will be approaching the career average qb ratings of fitz.  Petty will most likely never amount to a contributor.    So you disagree, that makes you more mature?  WELL, from where i'm standing, I'd have to disagree.  I'd also have to say the position of ending an argument with calling someone delusional and immature over any sports related (also pretty non-controversial) opinion is the very reason people hate the jets fan base.  You are so close, though!  Just stop going off the deep end with these useless comments and you'll be way better.  Honestly, your first two sentences were great!   The improvement was marginal. He'd have to make a huge leap in one off season. Its very unlikely and a lot of us rather be surprised than let down if he does or does not make a big enough Improvement.    ALSO, what's this have to do about brady? Seriously AT ALL...   You set up a straw man argument to relate someone's feeling about geno's future growth to the denial of brady's involvement in a rule breaking fiasco?  You did.  It makes absolutely no sense to have done that. You should see that you were wrong for doing that."
nyjets,35a28s,CosmicWy,1 point,Sat May 9 15:40:49 2015 UTC,The point is what is more likely to happen? If you actually say it's more likely Geno is good enough to beat Fitz than not then you are lying to yourself. Which is immature and stubborn. And right on par with the same type of denial as we've seen in the case of pats fans. So get it through your head.

On paper he's a young guy that has improved since his first year but still struggles with inconsistencies. He has a really good work ethic and is really motivated judging from social media so I wouldn't mind rolling with him for a little longer."
nyjets,35a28s,ocyries,2,Fri May 8 13:34:05 2015 UTC,"If Geno is better in camp then he will get to start until he proves he shouldn't. But if he's beaten by Fitz, Bowles isn't going to risk losing a game because Geno has potential. Camp is the only shot Geno has unless Fitz completely bombs or gets hurt."
nyjets,35a28s,darkknight915,2,Fri May 8 21:37:55 2015 UTC,I have always wanted to give Geno one more year. I gave Sanchez the same time frame. A project QB will take about 3 years to really start to get it and its not Geno's fault he was thrown to the wolves his first year in. I just hope if he doesn't pull his shit together we pull him out before the season is gone
nyjets,35a28s,ocyries,1 point,Fri May 8 14:40:17 2015 UTC,"Sanchez was a WAY better qb than Geno is. Every year that Sanchez was on the team the talent around him became progressively worse. Geno does not make good reads and doesn't protect the football at all. You put Sanchez on this current team we prob win the division, also Sanchez had the mental toughness that Geno has yet to display from draft day when he had to be convinced to stay in the green room by his agents."
nyjets,35a28s,darkknight915,8,Fri May 8 14:44:14 2015 UTC,"the jets in general were way better when Sanchez was on the team compared to the dumpster fire Geno was handed. after looking into it their stats are very similar, but the team was much better when Sanchez was on it. so with the limited info and searching i did, i would same Geno is better because similar stats with a worse team"
nyjets,35a28s,ocyries,1 point,Fri May 8 14:56:52 2015 UTC,"are you insane? When Sanchez was first drafted the the jets had a legitimate team because Mangini drafted and brought in those players. The Jet offensive line had 5 pro bowlers on it that year, not to mention Thomas Jones and Shonne Greene running behind that line. Every year after that the team got worse and Sanchez suffered through that. Geno is nowhere near the qb Sanchez is."
nyjets,35a28s,soggypoptart,6,Fri May 8 15:01:36 2015 UTC,"Sanchez sucked, I am not saying Geno is great but comparing the statistics they are about the same. but the difference is that Sanchez had a much better team around him, that doesn't say much about Sanchez. that why i think Geno is better. I am not saying either are/were good just Geno is better because of the lack of team around him but still having comparable stats  edit: here look at this. it supports me"
nyjets,35a28s,arv98s,3,Fri May 8 15:09:37 2015 UTC,"How did Geno have anything better? Your right Sanchez's supporting cast got worse over time and guess who inherited that team...Geno.  Half season of healthy Decker and Percy, other than that he has had an way over the hill Holmes/Kerley as the number 1/Greg Salas/David Nelson/w/e third stringer was rotated in that week.  I get that Geno has played like shit but to argue he has had a better team is completely insane to me."
nyjets,35a28s,bit99,2,Fri May 8 15:10:46 2015 UTC,"I was saying give him one more year. If he doesn't get better, then yeah he's done. And with a decent o line and s good wr corp, he's got no excuse."

nyjets,35a28s,KIM_JONG_1Ls_DONKEY,1 point,Fri May 8 20:26:02 2015 UTC,I still have faith in Geno. He has all the tools to succeed he just had an awful coaching staff (offensively at least). The offense they're putting out there now plus a good OC should put him in a position to be a decent player  It's not like we have a better option than him at this point anyway
nyjets,35a28s,akaneel,1 point,Fri May 8 21:55:20 2015 UTC,"If Geno can't succeed with the offense he has now, he's done not just with the Jets but any team."
nyjets,35a28s,John_YJKR,4,Fri May 8 17:43:16 2015 UTC,I guarantee you that within 72 hours of Geno's release he will get picked up as a backup
nyjets,35a28s,akaneel,1 point,Fri May 8 18:53:32 2015 UTC,Geno is good enough to be aback up. Plus he'd make a good practice QB. Even Tim Tebow has a job. Geno will be a back up somewhere.
nyjets,35a28s,John_YJKR,3,Fri May 8 21:42:31 2015 UTC,Tebow was a free agent for 2 years before he got picked up by a debatably mentally unstable coach.
nyjets,35a28s,escapingNihilism,1 point,Sat May 9 00:36:57 2015 UTC,True but he had offers from other teams but turned them down. Tebow is a bad QB overall but he's decent as a back up option in case of injury and what not. I'd rather start him than some back ups in the league.
nyjets,35a28s,darkknight915,1 point,Sat May 9 01:13:55 2015 UTC,Fitz will be the no. 1 on Opening Day.  he's still compromised by the knee injury.
nyjets,35a28s,qweasdzxc3000,0,Sat May 9 00:25:54 2015 UTC,"Geno is a terrible quarterback, did you people not watch him last year? It's not even growing pains with him he simply can't make the right reads and he is too careless with the football. In 30 games played he's played maybe 8 games that were good, other than that he has been horrendous for the Jets."
nyjets,35a28s,darkknight915,3,Fri May 8 13:59:25 2015 UTC,Not sure why you're being downvoted. When he leaves the Jets he will be a backup for the rest of his career.
nyjets,35a28s,Pyrollamas,3,Fri May 8 20:23:01 2015 UTC,You can't have a negative opinion on this sub it sends everyone into a frenzy. I'd love to be proven wrong about Geno but I've seen nothing in his 30 starts to prove otherwise. He doesn't take care of the football and that is essential for a qb. He has great potential but his he's not an intelligent player.
nyjets,35a28s,thibaultdp,1 point,Fri May 8 22:19:45 2015 UTC,Why.  Fitz > Geno by basically all metrics.  Starting Geno is wishful and dumb
nyjets,35b0iw,editnonameedit,10,Fri May 8 16:33:12 2015 UTC,I remember during the draft Kiper questioned why the niners would take Jenkins over Stephan Hill as Hill was a far better receiver.
nyjets,35b0iw,LaFours23,5,Fri May 8 17:10:56 2015 UTC,And Stephen Hill had considerably more production than Jenkins. The 49ers chose him because they thought he was really fast (hand timed). Then traded him to KC for another bust who had fewer years on contract. It's awful nice of you guys to give him a shot.
nyjets,35b0iw,Some-Redditor,1 point,Fri May 8 18:41:16 2015 UTC,He's a camp body. He has an uphill battle to make the PS

Nothing special...don't go expecting super excitement...but for me it was cool to see the NFL in such a low key manner, without all the production.  You kind of realize that the guys on the field are just normal people which you tend to forget with the hype machine of real games.  Playera come around for autographs after - hit or miss which ones.    Well worth it if the above sounds appealing.  Again don't expect a spectacle.  You can see really good plays and good players stand out...but you gotta be looking because it can be subtle in a way especially being there are many things going on at once and no TV forcing you to focus in on one thing."

It was a little less personal that day but probably because there were a Fuck ton of yokels there that came for tebows bday. Only Aaron Maybin signed autographs...

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

Tom Brady stood on that podium, then went on the radio, and straight-up lied to all of the brainwashed ""fans"" that are now trying to defend him. And the defenses keep getting weaker. When it first happened it was, ""where's the proof?"" and ""oh, that math is flawed."" (when the math clearly wasn't flawed). Now that there is evidence, it's, ""Oh, he was framed."" Even though he could exonerate himself by handing over the phone records. But he won't, which suggests to me he's got something to hide in there. The fans in New England just keep digging in their heels while the mounting evidence pushes them further and further back. Once the league hits him with his punishment, they'll still cry victim. Oh well."
nyjets,358l47,heli0sphere,16,Fri May 8 19:09:32 2015 UTC,"This is true though. He cheated. Done deal.  It doesn't matter the severity. How many Patriots fans were railing us with the Revis tampering? Well, that was investigated with no conclusive evidence of actual tampering, but it still was clear language that is against the rules and the Jets organization was hit with a 100K fine.   Now flash forward to today and it's clear that Brady knowingly cheated. ""Framegate"" is a dumbass remark from Brady Sr. because he isn't being framed....he knowingly cheated. After it all came out, he proceeded to go on the national stage and preach to everyone that it's crazy to be even accused of this. Well, cats out of the bag, and now you look like an idiot.  EDIT: Tired of /r/nyjets being so soft. This isn't the Browns or some irrelevant team. It's the damn Cheatriots. If you aren't giggly over this entire debacle than you're a shitty Jets fan."

nyjets,356pf7,iced1776,6,Thu May 7 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"Kerley is fantastic at moving the chains, but his biggest problem is that Geno doesn't see the field all that well.  Sanchez often dumped it off to Kerley because he's about average with field vision despite being below average in decision making. So he saw when Kerley was basically wide open, something Geno needs to really work on.   I only hope Geno's ability to see the field is something that takes reps to learn. He doesn't take off often, and ironically when he does take off, there's usually a receiver or two open. His field vision may be part of the reason why he makes bad decisions."

There was times where it felt like he was a ""Mr. 3rd down"" type making big plays to move the chains.   I think with all the other playmakers we got on the offensive side of the ball it will actually benefit him so long as we have someone with a brain under center."

nyjets,356pf7,Captain-Vimes,1 point,Thu May 7 18:23:16 2015 UTC,Don't just look at last year. He had a down year last year for some reason but if you check his stats and film for the rest of his career you'll see that he ranks as an above-average slot receiver.
nyjets,356pf7,mijobu,1 point,Thu May 7 18:24:56 2015 UTC,nyj87 is absolutely right.  I do think Kerley will benefit from the other WRs that MacDaddy put around him.  But he's never gonna be a Randall Cobb or a name everyone in the nation recognizes.  I like him for being a Jet since being drafted and for being a team player.  The latter is his best quality IMO
nyjets,356pf7,jetsfan07,2,Thu May 7 16:10:39 2015 UTC,"We don't need Randall Cobb or a name that everyone recognizes. With Marshall and Decker, Kerley is finally going to be in his comfort zone, which is moving the chains. It was pretty ridiculous having Kerley as a #1 at points last season and the season before. Guy is 5'9 and slow, you need to be tall or fast to play against a top corner."

nyjets,355xog,boredymcbored,10,Thu May 7 13:32:35 2015 UTC,He's the reason why we didn't need to go pass rusher earlier than we did in the draft. Glad he'll be utilized properly.
nyjets,355xog,42ndRedBalloonFromUp,3,Thu May 7 14:13:44 2015 UTC,Q is an enigma and a man without a position. He had his best season at DE and seems to play at his best as an interior pass rusher. Obviously we are a bit stacked at this position so he will have to stay at OLB. I hope Bowles is able to better utilize him here and take advantage of his abilities. Maybe have him rush at the interior of the line as I don't think he has the speed and bend to rush the edge.
nyjets,355xog,ExDiscoKittyCat,1 point,Thu May 7 15:03:12 2015 UTC,Yes He was better off at DE. I remember he dropped weight to play at OLB. He might be too light to play an interior rusher. He still is listed at 290 though. If I remember right he dropped to 275.

nyjets,3536sr,Manginaz,10,Wed May 6 18:52:24 2015 UTC,they are going line by line through the report looking for anything that can disprove that Brady new anything about it. its actually rather funny. on a serious side how could someone who has been playing football at his level for so long not notice something like that? its called plausible deniability
nyjets,3536sr,ocyries,5,Wed May 6 20:30:44 2015 UTC,"In fairness (and please consult my username for context) there's really no way to disprove that Brady had any knowledge of any deflation that may have taken place. The burden is on the report to make the case to provide either direct or circumstantial evidence that Brady did know about deflationary activities in order for us to accept that conclusion. I for one plan to wait for the media to mine the report for potential smoking guns and key evidence, and evaluate them one by one.   Innocent until proven guilty. This principle unfortunately applies to the Patriots as well."
nyjets,3536sr,SpygateHernandez,-5,Thu May 7 00:42:25 2015 UTC,"on a serious side how could someone who has been playing football at his level for so long not notice something like that?   Pressure in balls change by roughly 1 PSI for every 20 degrees above or below room temperature. All those ex-QBs like Brunnell who claimed that they would have been able to tell are full of shit because they would have been intimately aware that based on game conditions, they could be playing with balls anywhere from 9-15 psi.  Additionally, according to ESPN Sports Science, the difference between 10.5 psi (the most underinflated ball) and 12.5 psi is 1 gram, or the weight of a dollar bill. The 10.5 ball yields less than 1 additional mm under a firm grip."
nyjets,3536sr,sugar_free_haribo,-1,Thu May 7 01:19:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the most frustrating thing is that people are misusing pV=nRT. 1) It's gauge pressure, which is different from the number that is used in the calculations. 2) Does experimental data hold no weight? Sure it needs to be reproduced, but you get all these talking heads who didn't even test their theories. Science is done is labs, folks."

nyjets,3536sr,Lukas327,31,Thu May 7 17:19:44 2015 UTC,"Fair points all.  With regard to the characterizations of Brady's knowledge in the Wells report however, I would point out that 1) ""more probable than not"" is a legal term of art and speaks to the burden of proof in a civil matter.  You don't have to prove without a doubt like you would in a criminal matter. Here, due to the nature of the texts back and forth from the staff wherein Brady is paying with autographed merchandise and sneakers for the balls to be treated a certain way that would be enough for more probable than not. 2) Brady would not give his own cell phone to aid in the investigation. Now I would like to think that is because he has a bunch of pictures of his hot wife he didn't want hitting Deadspin, but the fact is, he obstructed the investigation.    If they gave Ray Farmer 4 games for texting during a game because it effected the integrity of the game, when he wasn't even playing, how much does a systematic process to remove air from the football for the team with the lowest fumble rating at home in the league effect the game?  I say minimum, 1 year suspension.   TL;DR: Fuck the Pats."
nyjets,3536sr,GreatOdinsRaven_,15,Wed May 6 18:58:21 2015 UTC,"""more probable than not"" is a legal term of art and speaks to the burden of proof in a civil matter. You don't have to prove without a doubt like you would in a criminal matter.    Can't stress this enough. Per Scott Salmon: ""There's a lot of confusion about the language of ""more probable than not."" Unless Wells caught Brady in the act of deflating the balls he isn't going to say it's conclusive, from a legal perspective, even if the evidence he uses to demonstrate his point is pretty conclusive."""
nyjets,3536sr,ExDiscoKittyCat,8,Wed May 6 19:30:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly, you can almost never say conclusive without video evidence of something. But far be it for anyone trying to use this as a loophole to use logic."

This is worse than any domestic violence case the NFL has seen as this case directly affects the sport(not condoning any form of wife/gf/women beating).

However, I think you are, with the best of intentions, doing a disservice by perpetuating the false idea that ""more probable than not"" is a weak standard of proof.   Yes, it is weaker than ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" as required in criminal cases, but it is exactly the standard used in most US courts for civil lawsuits. In fact the phrase ""more probable than not"" is from a 1947 precedent-setting lawsuit. To be found to be ""more probable than not"" guilty of doing something is serious. Serious enough to lose a lawsuit in a US court. (For a reference, see here.)  The fact that the Wells report didn't make the legally robust standing of proof it used explicit is, in my view, intentional obfuscation, to let Patriots fans/defenders (and Brady's dad) believe that someone an unjust standard of proof is being used against Brady and the Pats.  That is simply not so. The standard of proof Wells used is the exact same standard that would hold up in the court of law.   Asking us all to stay classy -- thumbs up.

nyjets,352wkl,BucIt,2,Wed May 6 22:19:47 2015 UTC,"No way can they say it's much of a non-issue now. Especially considering that does anyone believe they haven't been doing this for a long time?  So they may not have needed that advantage against the Colts that game, but what about other games that were close?  They may have had an advantage with these balls. Doesnt mean it made them win,  but it was still an advantage."

nyjets,352wkl,kuyakew,25,Wed May 6 17:43:17 2015 UTC,Brady should be suspended Weeks 7 and 16. He'll have to watch the game from up in the Goodyear blimp. It's only fair.

Just because Belichump says a lot of intentionally ambiguous scientific terms all of NE is like SEE, NOTHING TO SEE HERE, when in reality, there is certainly something to see here.

nyjets,352wkl,KyleWrap,3,Thu May 7 18:13:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah i don't see anyone responding to it lol. This is just an excerpt from an ESPN article as well.   ""In rejecting Bill Belichick's explanation about the science of how PSI in footballs will naturally drop in certain conditions, the Wells report concluded that the average rate of drop in 11 Patriots footballs was significantly more than the average rate of drop in four Colts footballs. Why 11 to four? Because officials measured only four Colts footballs, as they were running out of time before the second half began. This simply isn't fair to take a larger sample size and compare it to a smaller sample size. For example, I could just as easily pick the initial four Patriots PSI measurements (a drop from 12.5 to 11.80, 11.20, 11.50 and 11.00 from alternate official Dyrol Prioleau), match them up with the four Colts measurements (a drop from an estimated 13.0/13.1 to 12.35, 12.30, 12.95 and 12.15 from Prioleau), and come to a different conclusion that the drop rates of PSI between the two teams were close. Also, it's clear when matching the PSI readings between the two alternate officials that there is margin for error in the readings. Thus, I reject the Wells report explanation for dismissing the role of science based on their usage of this uneven data between teams."""

nyjets,352wkl,BobaFett313,38,Thu May 7 03:34:08 2015 UTC,How convenient the report only came out after the Super Bowl and draft
nyjets,352wkl,frexistential,3,Wed May 6 17:58:58 2015 UTC,"I'd rather them lose draft picks next year anyhow, not when their first pick is 32."
nyjets,352wkl,That_Guy381,11,Wed May 6 20:06:20 2015 UTC,"Not trying to invade here, and besides I have you tagged as real cool Jets + Devils fan. Anyway, this report is hundreds of pages long. I don't know how you could expect for it to come out before the superbowl. And as for it coming out before the draft, nothing in there would ever come close to voiding a draft pick.   This instance of ""rule breaking"" is about as much as cheating as a pass interference is. In fact, a PI probably would have more effect on a game than the balls."
nyjets,352wkl,BobaFett313,10,Wed May 6 18:37:35 2015 UTC,"I agree that the report is hundreds of pages long, but the timing is still fishy. The cheating had a direct impact on games throughout the season (if those texts during the Jets game are anything to go by), and in the AFC championship game. That is certainly worthy of a draft pick. This rule breaking had a much larger effect on the game than a single PI. To have the ball be both easier to throw and catch is a humongous advantage. At this level of play, every millisecond or ounce makes a difference"
nyjets,352wkl,JASPriest,4,Wed May 6 18:43:24 2015 UTC,"the timing is still fishy   Maybe the NFL timed it to worsen the punishment. The Pats most likely won't win the Super Bowl this year (repeats rarely happen and they lost some talented players) so their 2016 picks would be better than their 2015 picks, thus worsening the punishment! #conspiracy"
nyjets,352wkl,BootRecognition,7,Wed May 6 22:23:39 2015 UTC,"Trust me when I say this: anything done by a law firm is going to take a long damn time, especially so when it results in this long of a report. To be honest, I'm surprised they got it done this fast. You would not believe the number of rewrites that almost certainly went into this thing.   To me it sounds like they did a thorough job and took the time they needed to do it."
nyjets,352wkl,BobaFett313,2,Wed May 6 19:34:49 2015 UTC,"I'm certainly happy that they took their time, but, it just kind of adds insult to injury that it comes after the Super Bowl and draft"
nyjets,352wkl,BootRecognition,7,Wed May 6 19:36:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if they'll lose any draft picks since nobody apparently knew about it beyond Brady and the two staff guys. They lost a draft pick from Spygate because that was a fuckup by BB/the team as a whole.   At this point I'd expect that Brady will have to pay a hefty fine and might get suspended a game or two. Given that there's no way this report could have been completed before the Super Bowl and it likely wouldn't have made any impact on the draft, I'm not upset.   Hell, even if they do lose any draft picks, I'd prefer it be for NEXT year's draft since they'll almost certainly have higher draft picks (assuming they don't win another fucking Super Bowl)."
nyjets,352wkl,BobaFett313,5,Wed May 6 19:46:51 2015 UTC,All good points. I guess I can't get too upset. I see a small suspension coming for Brady and those equipment managers will never work in the league again
nyjets,352wkl,BigNuke43,7,Wed May 6 19:53:21 2015 UTC,"If Goodell can suspend Sean Payton for a year over bountygate when he apparently didn't know about it, I don't see why NE couldn't be punished similarly."
nyjets,352wkl,BootRecognition,8,Wed May 6 19:55:27 2015 UTC,"Bountygate was a team wide scandal. Peyton claimed he didn't know about it, but it was clearly something that he damn well should have known about given its prevalence throughout the team.   In this case, you have a single player pressuring two low level guys to break the rules for him in a way that's not necessarily that noticeable at all to the rest of the team.   Don't get me wrong, I loathe BB and the Pats in general, but it seems that the blame for this lies with Brady (and his two flunkies) rather than the Pats as a group."
nyjets,352wkl,king_kong_,0,Wed May 6 20:12:03 2015 UTC,It had nothing to do with whether he probably knew or not. The fact of the matter is ignorance is not an excuse when you are running a team. Belicheck should be punished accordingly based on the precedent the NFL already set.   I'm not saying I agree with it from a moral stance - but the precedent was already set. Nuff said.
nyjets,352wkl,That_Guy381,-9,Thu May 7 01:22:20 2015 UTC,Did you see the sport science done when this thing was at its height?

nyjets,352wkl,BobaFett313,10,Wed May 6 19:00:45 2015 UTC,"1.5% easier to catch, is a fairly large difference at this level. So is the defender being able to cover 1 inch due to the ball moving slower. Cheating is cheating however. However minuscule, it still had an effect on the game"
nyjets,352wkl,That_Guy381,-7,Wed May 6 19:08:07 2015 UTC,"The defended being able to cover an addition inch hurt brady, not helped him."

nyjets,352wkl,That_Guy381,3,Wed May 6 19:54:02 2015 UTC,Systematically cheating.  Right. Name one instance other than spygate which you all seem to harp on so much.
nyjets,352wkl,BobaFett313,2,Wed May 6 22:43:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is true. The issue is that Brady and the Pats got caught making the balls tailor-made to how Brady likes them. If you can't play with the balls how they are supposed to be and need to have them personalized, then maybe you shouldn't be playing in the NFL. If no one else is personalizing their footballs, then its an unfair advantage. While I'm not saying that no other QB's change the balls to their liking, no other QB's got caught."
nyjets,352wkl,NotAModBro,1 point,Wed May 6 19:19:14 2015 UTC,"Other QBs are personalizing the balls. Difference here is after the refs check them, your cant do anything to them after, which is the case here."
nyjets,352wkl,That_Guy381,0,Thu May 7 17:20:33 2015 UTC,We don't know Brady's involvement. When I read the report they said that brady may have been involved but I see no evidence pointing to it.
nyjets,352wkl,Howulikeit,5,Wed May 6 22:48:06 2015 UTC,Is your argument seriously that the patriots hurt themselves by cheating? That is an incredible display of mental gymnastics to justify it.

nyjets,352wkl,That_Guy381,-1,Wed May 6 20:10:27 2015 UTC,I never said that. That's what sports science says.
nyjets,352wkl,jcy,2,Wed May 6 22:43:51 2015 UTC,they had zero fumbles at home if you care to read the article from @greatodinsraven   The 2014 Patriots were just the 3rd team in the last 25 years to never have lost a fumble at home!
nyjets,352wkl,That_Guy381,-2,Wed May 6 21:26:57 2015 UTC,Maybe because Belichek benched the running backs when they lose a fumble
nyjets,352wkl,Sonsof_Manarchy,2,Wed May 6 22:35:49 2015 UTC,What about the fact though that he can grip the ball better with a deflated ball and in turn can probably throw a better pass with the ball. They were using throwing machines...
nyjets,352wkl,That_Guy381,0,Wed May 6 21:35:23 2015 UTC,"I hear the word probably. That means it isn't fact. Therefore, it can be disregarded"
nyjets,352wkl,DatGrag,1 point,Wed May 6 22:49:42 2015 UTC,"You should also take into account the mental aspect.  And the effect that even a ball that feels 1% different may be enough to throw off the type of perfection needed at this level.  Mad respect for coming in here and trying to have a legitimate conversation, though."
nyjets,352wkl,That_Guy381,1 point,Wed May 6 19:52:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the respect lol. It's what I do, have conversations.   One thing I'll say is that the mental aspect does physically nothing. I'm sure every player goes into the game feeling the same, wanting a victory. Just because you think your equipment is better doesn't mean it is"
nyjets,352wkl,DatGrag,-2,Wed May 6 22:45:04 2015 UTC,"But you might play better because you believe things are slightly tilted in your favor, even if it has very little physical impact, as they showed on sports science, look up the Placebo effect.  Also the opposing QB might feel a little bit off mentally due to the ball being slightly different than normal.  Also it's like blatant intentional cheating.  I think you and I are both rational people and I don't think this is like a HUGE fucking deal. Belicheck just weighs the risk and reward of cheating and decides whether or not to do it. He doesn't use a moral compass. Which is really smart and probably what I would do too if I wanted to win.  He got caught though and he should pay the consequences. The consequences will not be severe, as you have said in the first place. Which is the reason why the Pats did this in the first place. The potential reward greatly outweighed the potential risk."
nyjets,352wkl,That_Guy381,0,Wed May 6 23:33:38 2015 UTC,"Haha what? Do you even know what's going on? The opposing Qb never touched the patriots balls, and belichek knew absolutely nothing about this."

nyjets,352wkl,DougDimmadome44,2,Thu May 7 12:52:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I think the one thing that will be forgotten now this news about Brady bribing those guys is that deflated footballs don't make that much of a difference anyway.
nyjets,352wkl,vintagegush,2,Thu May 7 13:10:15 2015 UTC,"Everyone who presented the facts about the Patriots fumble percentage and seeing a strong correlation was called a conspiracy theorist. Those who have played football, specifically RB could tell you that a ball that you can squeeze tight and get a better grip on gives you an advantage in being able to hold onto the ball (not fumble). I honestly don't think it helped Brady as much as it helped the RBs. It sucks because we have players getting arrested and doing things a lot worse for the image of the league than this, but somehow this is a big deal. I'd love for the NFL to clean up its image on drugs, DUIs, domestic violence, and other matters rather than this. Being a Jets fan, my dislike of the Pats does make me a bit happy to see the League trying to punish the Pats because they've had a few cases of bending the rules, but at them same time I'm very disappointed that players who are getting arrested, are involved in shootings, and other major off-field issues seem to get a few games suspension and they're back to making millions. I think the League is starting to pickup on this, but for the wrong reason..it hurts their PR. Overall quite fucking stupid, but then again fuck the Pats."
nyjets,352wkl,That_Guy381,1 point,Thu May 7 13:58:31 2015 UTC,"Copy pasted from another thread in /r/nfl by a Eagles flair:   I love how many dude's here have their thongs in a knot over a slight change in air pressure in a football. The only reason anyone gives a shit is because it's Tom Brady and the Patriots and people want to find any chink in the armor because they're jealous of their success. Two teams got caught heating up footballs and no one gives a shit. Fake crowd noise, text messages to the sidelines, Rodgers saying he likes his footballs over-inflated, no one gives a fuck. But holy hell watch out if Tom tells two boners to drop some air pressure because he prefers it slightly less. And save the altruistic bullshit about ""INTEGRITY"", ""ABSOLUTELY REPREHENSIBLE BEHAVIOR"" ""cheating is cheating!!! Cheatriots!!!"" Get a fucking grip, every organization is knowingly bending the rules in some fashion."
nyjets,352wkl,vintagegush,2,Thu May 7 17:27:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean I feel the same way essentially, not as strong as the Eagles fan but toned down. I have to be completely honest and say that I would like a punishment because I'm a Jets fan and we've hated the patriots for way longer than anyone else, but if this was Aaron Rodgers on the stand I would have to say its the stupidest thing ever"
nyjets,352wkl,kenbrellfan,8,Thu May 7 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"You Patriots fans are seriously delusional. This would not be your reaction if the Jets were caught doing this. Cheating, then arguing that the effect is so minor it doesn't warrant any penalty is truly absurd. That would be like corking your bat in baseball, then presenting a study that shows that corking your bat actually gives you less power. If it really is a meaningless difference, then why do it? And that even misses the point. You're not following the rules. You don't get to decide that your cheating doesn't matter.  edit: grammar"
nyjets,352wkl,That_Guy381,-11,Thu May 7 02:38:29 2015 UTC,Cept the patriots didn't do anything wrong. It was two locker room nutjobs who seemed to have some vendetta against brady.
nyjets,352wkl,k_rock923,7,Thu May 7 15:22:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's meaningless, but we had to put up with SO MUCH ""technically it was against the rules"" talk with the Revis tampering, that I don't really have any sympathy left.  A literal interpretation is what the patriots wanted - that's what they have now."
nyjets,352wkl,That_Guy381,0,Thu May 7 15:30:32 2015 UTC,I thought that the whole revis thing wasn't that big of a deal.
nyjets,352wkl,k_rock923,4,Thu May 7 19:54:11 2015 UTC,"It wasn't.  I think neither one of these are a big deal.  That being said, the Patriots decided that it was big enough to warrant filing tampering charges, citing that technically Woody broke the rules by talking about another player under contract.  If that's the organization's stance, that ""technically it broke the rule"" should be penalized, I don't see how this isn't ""technically breaking the rule""."
nyjets,352wkl,Giblaz,2,Wed May 6 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"Brady is probably going to get fined at least $25,000, since the rulebook states that as the minimum fine for this infraction.  Then again, we haven't heard anything definitive yet. It could be more money, or it could be a suspension. I think no matter what, leaguewide teams are going to have to start cleaning up what they do. The Falcons admitted to sending noise in this season. The Browns had their GM texting situation. Seahawks had PEDs 2 years ago. The list goes on...  If Brady pressured the 2 guys into lowering it BELOW the legal limit, then that's a damn shame - I haven't seen that line in the Wells report yet but I haven't read the whole thing. Right now it's mostly just 2 guys talking about deflating/inflating footballs - every team has equipment handlers like these.  I think most everyone is talking out of their ass with this report on both sides. I doubt many have read through the whole thing - if someone has, I'd actually like to hear their opinion regardless of biases."
nyjets,352wkl,nyc4ever,9,Wed May 6 22:49:11 2015 UTC,"Cept Brady refused to cooperate with the investigation or hand over his phone.  Cept Brady pretended he didn't know one of the locker room guys, when their texts proved this to be an outright lie.  Cept Brady gave signed memorabilia to the locker room guys in exchange for their deflations."
nyjets,352wkl,That_Guy381,-3,Wed May 6 23:03:43 2015 UTC,"When did brady say he didn't know the locker room guys...?  Besides the point, the doesnt mean brady knew what they were doing was illegal. He told them to deflate them to legal levels, but they put it below that."
nyjets,352wkl,nietzsche_niche,5,Wed May 6 23:58:39 2015 UTC,he told them to deflate them to legal levels? what proof do you have? it certainly wouldnt be texts from his phone since he's acted like a coward ass bitch this entire time

nyjets,352wkl,nietzsche_niche,2,Thu May 7 01:28:18 2015 UTC,"I dont need 'proof.' This isnt a criminal case. All the contextual/statistical/outside information is that he did it.

nyjets,352wkl,That_Guy381,-2,Wed May 6 22:53:22 2015 UTC,Want to bet money he will not be suspended? Because that is a rediculous notion
nyjets,352wkl,nyc4ever,5,Wed May 6 22:59:25 2015 UTC,"It’s also interesting to note that Tom Brady denied knowing who McNally was. The Wells’ report found that unconvincing.

When someone is calling signals in front of ~80,000 people, its on TV and everything but someone just records it. Kind of stupid since everyone did it. Also with the deflation..Don't see anyone talking about how Rodgers over inflates his. Lets not forget that back in 2014 , during the Vikings game sideline attendants were holding balls next to heaters to heat the balls up. You could say that is doctoring a ball as well. No one ever talked about that now did they? Now, you could argue that they were given a warning and the league sent out notices after the fact. However, the refs were made aware of this before the AFCCG but somehow the Pats never knew about it..sketchy. Its one giant manhunt for the pats because every other team hates us cause we are the most winning-est team over the past 10+ years."

nyjets,352wkl,JelliedHam,5,Wed May 6 20:53:37 2015 UTC,he gave them autographs and sneakers to deflate the balls
nyjets,352wkl,ABearWithABeer,4,Wed May 6 18:03:09 2015 UTC,"Not to mention all the suspicious phone calls and texts from him to equipment manager on the days just after the scandal. They don't ever talk on the phone, but they magically started talking twice a day just after being caught. Brady calls him JJ.

nyjets,352wkl,ABearWithABeer,3,Wed May 6 18:56:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think someone giving out autographs is the same as giving out items they personally spend $1000+ dollars one. Tom Brady giving someone a signed ball is not the same as me giving you a $1000 item. It essentially cost him nothing. I'm not surprised that people who work closely with the team receive autographs or other team-oriented gifts. In the context of everything in the report, I think the gifts are the least significant."
nyjets,352wkl,nietzsche_niche,1 point,Wed May 6 19:38:56 2015 UTC,"jesus, this isnt about what brady had to give up its about what the sadsacks in the clubhouse had to lose. theres no incentive to give those guys things that are valuable to them unless they were doing something that was valuable to him. if he didnt know it was against the rules then literally anyone could have worked the balls. there would have been no reason to repeatedly give them gifts for a quick errand."
nyjets,352wkl,ABearWithABeer,3,Wed May 6 21:51:32 2015 UTC,"There's also nothing inherently manipulative about giving people who work for you a gift. My company will randomly give our employees complementary dinners, gifts and other things and it's not because we're embezzling funds, it's just because they like to acknowledge people's work."

nyjets,352wkl,GV22,3,Thu May 7 01:53:52 2015 UTC,"You're just proving my point. The gifts were the least important evidence in the case. It's the circumstances surrounding it, the texts, the meetings etc."
nyjets,352wkl,rillo561,3,Thu May 7 02:01:04 2015 UTC,He's offering them autographs in exchange for deflated balls. I'd say that is encouraging it.

nyjets,352wkl,JetsStrat,6,Thu May 7 02:23:36 2015 UTC,"I can see from the language that they used they had all the proof they needed that Brady ordered the balls to be deflated, but he lied to investigators about it.   So to soften calling him out they just used probable, but ultimately he is just a lousy cheater.    Hey, at least we can ignore another SB by the Pats."

nyjets,352wkl,domsanti,3,Wed May 6 18:58:47 2015 UTC,Its a very well written report.  I wasn't surprised by the findings.  Ted Wells is an excellent attorney.  It was pretty clear that the game balls had been deflated - and that would never have happened w/o Brady's assent.  When Wells gets into the electronic discovery and the texts etc - its very damaging in that this shows a deliberated organized situation and that gets towards the integrity of the game etc.  Not good.

nyjets,352wkl,ABearWithABeer,-10,Wed May 6 18:00:39 2015 UTC,3 out of 4 of the Colts balls were under the legal PSI as well.
nyjets,352wkl,NotAModBro,12,Wed May 6 18:51:07 2015 UTC,did you read the report at all? You can attribut the loss in PSI at those values due to the weather.  However the report states after all of the tests that the change in the patriots balls could not be entirely attributed to the weather or other outside forces.
nyjets,352wkl,GV22,4,Wed May 6 20:52:49 2015 UTC,Both team's balls lost PSI but the Patriots balls averaged losing 1.2 PSI which was almost triple what the Colts' .47 average PSI loss.

They make sure to stress ball control, which is why you see Brady take sacks and look rushed in the pocket when he has time, simply because he is told to ensure that the ball doesnt turn over. Yes, the Pats suck for deflating balls, but this is grasping at straws. They dont fumble, because they are trained specifically NOT to fumble at the cost of additional yards."

nyjets,353unl,RealMarkSanchez,3,Thu May 7 05:35:16 2015 UTC,"You're right, the team has improved incredibly since the last season. Yet, the rest of the division improved, and you never know what's going to happen with quarterback play. Geno his rookie year got us to 8 wins, so we were optimistic that we would at least equal that. Last season we saw what bad quarterback play could do to a team. While we did struggle at other spots, mainly cornerback, the qb play was still a huge factor to our 4-12 record. Optimistically, this team will be sensational. Yet, if Fitz or Geno do not step up to at least have average play, we most likely will not make the playoffs. Remember, we barely made it in a 9-7 Rex's first year with Sanchez and that team was also loaded. I think that we will make the playoffs this year, but we also have as much of a chance to have a bad season as well. The best record we could have is 12-4, and if everything goes wrong we could be looking at 5-11 at the other end of the spectrum."

nyjets,353unl,Amoress,1 point,Thu May 7 00:05:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah don't get me wrong, we were a really good team in 2009, but I don't thing that we were even close to being ""loaded"". Even in 2010 when we had the 13th best offense and 6th best defense I would still hesitate to call us loaded."
nyjets,353unl,matts77,1 point,Thu May 7 03:23:06 2015 UTC,"1) We haven't even seen this team play yet, it looks great on paper, but so did last year's Jets team and we saw how that turned out.  2) 2009 defense was pretty damn loaded. The other secondary members didn't need to be stars when Revis was having one of the best seasons in defensive back history, and 2009's linebackers are much better than this year's. The WR's were bad, sure, but it's not like we relied on throwing the ball much and our running game was insane.  2009 team was more talented than this one, but that's just my opinion until we see this year's team on the field."
nyjets,353unl,RodKimble_Stuntman,1 point,Sat May 9 22:55:09 2015 UTC,"1) I'm going to say one thing about last years team, we were MUCH better than our record shows. I don't remember exactly who said it, but someone said something like ""we are the best 4-12 team in the history of the NFL"". When I first heard that I thought it was crazy, but looking back at it he was right. If the ball bounced just a little differently in a few games we were easily a .500 team. We lost two games against NE on blocked field goals, we all know what happened in the Green Bay game, and then the first dolphins game was literally a coin flip. That brings us to 8 wins, and then you can even go a little further and say if we didn't blitz 7 against the Vikings in OT and if the refs didn't blow the fumble dead against Chicago we could have ended the season with around 10 wins. We should not have been a four win team last year.  2) You said that the 2009 team was loaded, but then you contradicted yourself with your reasoning. You said the other secondary members didn't need to be stars, and that it didn't matter that the WR's were bed because we didn't rely on throwing. Now both of those are totally true, but htat does not make the team loaded. That means the team worked REALLY well together and we played to our strengths, which in all honesty is probably better than being loaded."
nyjets,353unl,matts77,3,Sun May 17 16:17:41 2015 UTC,"And I feel like people are being unrealistically optimistic. Shades of ""in idzik we trust"" and ""we're building a dynasty"" all over again. Different front office, same bullshit."

I don't think we can compete for anything significant without at least above-average quarterback play."
nyjets,353unl,domsanti,2,Sat May 9 22:59:21 2015 UTC,I'm with you. We got the defense and the offense. It's all in Geno and Fitzmagics hands now.

Just say that the Jets will win the division in 2015 with at least a 10-6 win record.  Then I could understand why you believe the Jets will stomp the Bills.  No, recent history says the other way around is more likely."

nyjets,353unl,Dacious96,1 point,Wed May 6 23:40:44 2015 UTC,"Every year teams make acquisitions through FA and the draft. We aren't the only team to make new additions, other teams have other players who will either develop and get better or get worse.   We have a 1st year head coach, there is no guarantee he will be a good head coach (though I personally do think he will be). We have a young, unproven staff and assistant coaches who have not shown they can handle their duties in preparing and developing the talent on the roster.  As for right now, Geno is the starter and he struggled a lot in converting in the redzone and turnovers. If we can't improve in these category's, then we will be in the same boat as we were last year.   As with every team, injury's are a part of the game, if any of our major players go down with injury, that could seriously impact how well we perform.   There are reason to be optimistic as you have said in your post, but until we see how this team actually performs, I personally am going to say we are 7-8 win team."

nyjets,352mm5,jetsfan07,7,Wed May 6 16:15:36 2015 UTC,"What makes Petty a good practice QB though? He's mostly just an arm guy, it's not like you can run through plays with him and get a lot out of it. Bonner would have made a good practice QB.  Plus, most of WR's development isn't really in the part where they actually catch the ball- it's everything up to that point. That's where we've had most of our guys struggle."

If we happen to hit the jackpot and have someone the level of Dalton out of him, that would be awesome, but not what is expected."
nyjets,352mm5,Rugger11,3,Wed May 6 16:27:28 2015 UTC,What makes you so absolutely sure what his ceiling is?
nyjets,352mm5,M3nt0R,2,Thu May 7 00:56:56 2015 UTC,"I would say the fact that he's coming into the league as a 24 year old (1 year younger than RG3 and Luck, who will be going into their 4th years), coming from the same system that RG3 came from, and has a ton of on-field concerns. Petty turning into Andy Dalton would be like finding another Tom Brady in the 6th round. It's highly unlikely and the expectation should be set much lower than that."
nyjets,352mm5,Blitz93,1 point,Thu May 7 10:10:39 2015 UTC,He hasn't had a go at the pro offense. Maybe he'll pick it up like a savant in 1 year. Who knows. Based on his physical attributes his potential is crazy high. And the age thing is kinda irrelevant. Russell Wilson was 24 his rookie year too.
nyjets,352mm5,Steph360WithTheWrist,1 point,Sat May 9 17:23:30 2015 UTC,"It's not irrelevant. A 24 year old is more developed than a 21 or 22 year old coming into the league. It's not a huge deal either but something to consider. And yes his physical attributes are great but tons of QBs come into the league with great physical attributes and fail miserably.   Statistics alone will tell you a 4th round pick has almost no shot to be even an average starting NFL QB. So yes, of course he has a chance to be good but I think most can confidently say his ceiling is no higher than Andy Dalton with all the factors working against him."
nyjets,352mm5,Blitz93,1 point,Sat May 9 17:30:18 2015 UTC,"He isn't the best with dealing with pressure and doesn't work the pocket well. When seeing pressure, his mechanics go off. His accuracy is not consistent, sometimes widely missing wide open targets with clean pockets and no pressure. He is 24 with some back problems and the system he had in college will be difficult to translate to the NFL. He has a big arm but sometimes is lacking velocity on his intermediate passes. At the end of the day, he was a fourth round pick for a reason. Also, lets not pull Tom Brady out, he is an extreme outlier and should not be brought up in discussions like this. Is it possible he could have a Brady-esque career? Sure. Likely? Not at all."

nyjets,350bgq,MasterCheftain,5,Wed May 6 01:16:20 2015 UTC,"Gotta think the FO knows this. They're banking on his personality, intelligence and time to overcome that stuff. In the 4th a QB like Petty is probably a good value hence the pick."
nyjets,350bgq,kuyakew,3,Wed May 6 03:11:00 2015 UTC,"If Petty has even a 6% chance of being an elite QB, why not take that chance? Maccagnan believes in his draft picks and the moves he has made to improve the roster, and I think he is confident that the other value he got in the draft made that 4th round pick for Petty to be an acceptable risk."
nyjets,350bgq,mytoemytoe,5,Wed May 6 12:36:08 2015 UTC,The guy was a 4th round pick. Can we please remember that?
nyjets,350bgq,danomite555,7,Wed May 6 12:39:27 2015 UTC,"I mean I have no love for Petty but this is the big picture. Take a look at other recent 4th rd QBs:  Logan Thomas  Tom Savage  Matt Barkley  Ryan Nassib*  Tyler Wilson  Landry Jones  Kirk Cousins*  Mike Kafka  Stephen McGee  Of all of those guys only Nassib and Cousins look decent and Cousins isn't very good. The ""bust"" chance for 4th rd picks is high - see Jalen Saunders lol - let along QBs in general."
nyjets,350bgq,ExDiscoKittyCat,2,Wed May 6 16:03:16 2015 UTC,"We kinda knew this though. I wouldn't worry too much cause the formula does heavily weight the opposition he faced. That's not in his control or his fault. However, the formula is fairly reliable. Really its a wait and see. Hopefully he can sit for two seasons and develop into something worthwhile. Honestly I see the jets as players for moving up to grab a QB in next years draft regardless of how they finish this season. Which is likely 8 to 10 wins. Petty is just a little insurance in the event the price is too high. And it will be high. Our QB situation has definitely improved since last season but it couldn't get much worse."
nyjets,350bgq,John_YJKR,2,Wed May 6 01:43:25 2015 UTC,Most people who've broken down Petty's tape have less than kind words too.
nyjets,350bgq,NannigarCire,4,Wed May 6 16:57:30 2015 UTC,"They say Winston has a 60% chance of being a bust based solely on his play. When you add off the field issues, that number would have to go up to 70-80%. They have Petty's chance of busting at 80.2%.  So there's two potential takeaways from this in my opinion.   This is totally bogus. Jameis Winston and Bryce Petty have a similar chance of busting. Even if you don't think his off the field issues are a big deal and he only has a 5% chance of busting because of them (which I think is ridiculous), that's still only a 15% difference.   I choose number 1."
nyjets,350bgq,kenbrellfan,2,Wed May 6 01:47:36 2015 UTC,I don't know how they come up with the probabilities.  But just based on past average of all highly drafted qbs 60% bust rate is probably not that high.  Id say an even higher percentage of rookies bust.
nyjets,350bgq,sharked,1 point,Wed May 6 13:14:12 2015 UTC,"Article if you are interested in how they come up with the probabilities.   Football Outsiders liked Hundley a lot more as did I. But yeah, the bust % was high in this years class."
nyjets,350bgq,ExDiscoKittyCat,1 point,Wed May 6 16:08:43 2015 UTC,Seems pretty fair. Its very rare 4th round QBs workout. A 20% chance of success for a 4th round QB sounds about right.
nyjets,350bgq,Truffles413,2,Wed May 6 13:45:52 2015 UTC,"well yeah I agree on Petty, even though I believe in him, 20% sounds about right. But if Jameis is a 40% chance before we count off the field concerns, that sounds like we got a steal with Petty."
nyjets,34yn2m,aintevenmadbrah,42,Tue May 5 17:26:02 2015 UTC,I would love nothing more than to see Geno come out of camp as the clear cut winner of the QB comp. I just don't have much faith that he will.
nyjets,34yn2m,JetsStrat,3,Tue May 5 17:57:12 2015 UTC,This is the bottom line. We all want and hope Geno does develop and lives up to his potential. But we are being realistic. He likely is what we've seen or close to it. At some point we all have to accept that.
nyjets,34yn2m,John_YJKR,3,Tue May 5 20:07:18 2015 UTC,There he is
nyjets,34yn2m,akaneel,2,Tue May 5 21:54:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like I (and many others on this sub) will accept that if he comes out this year with no visible improvement. Let's face it, when have we been able to put 4 competent receivers on the field. With Marshall Decker Kerley and Smith our receiving corps is better than its been in a long long time. Add amaro to that mix, bring in the running game that has consistently been in top-10 and have a shut down defense that will get him the ball, I think Geno can surprise.   If not.. call the billboard guys."
nyjets,34yn2m,mosherd14,1 point,Thu May 7 22:47:49 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I don't see Bowles letting him start if Fitz looks better than him in camp. I don't see them wasting starts on Geno's potential. He has to beat Fitz outright in camp.
nyjets,34yn2m,John_YJKR,15,Thu May 7 23:01:55 2015 UTC,I think Geno has a very high ceiling and I'm personally rooting for him to win the job outright. But I'm pretty glad we have other options if he doesn't. This can't be a wasted year with wildly fluctuating QB play.
nyjets,34yn2m,boxtowire,4,Tue May 5 18:05:26 2015 UTC,"I love how we have Fitz- who went to Harvard, knows how to read and  call plays, and knows Chan Gailey's offense. Petty will be perfect to develop- he has the athletic ability, arm strength, and determination to be a great QB. I think for now we're better off in the QB situation than most people believe."
nyjets,34yn2m,Andaroodle,5,Tue May 5 18:13:18 2015 UTC,Fitz is a patriot killer
nyjets,34yn2m,shewantstheMcB,10,Tue May 5 22:51:42 2015 UTC,"I think recent rookie superstars like Andrew luck have skewed our viewpoint of rookie qbs. Last season geno's total quarterback rating was a 77.5. In Eli manning's first three years as a starter, he didn't start his most of his rookie year, his best qb rating for a season was 77. Alex smith didn't break 75 in his first 5 seasons and I think we could win with our defense and him at qb. Drew brees didn't break 77 in his first 2 seasons as a starter, also didn't start his rookie year. Any of these quarterbacks could win a championship of paired with our defense."
nyjets,34yn2m,angrypuppy,9,Wed May 6 00:22:00 2015 UTC,I can't wait to see Smith to Smith.  Geno has a great deep ball that he can never use cause we didn't have the personnel for it.
nyjets,34yn2m,BigNuke43,6,Tue May 5 17:31:45 2015 UTC,I cant wait!
nyjets,34yn2m,angrypuppy,1 point,Tue May 5 17:44:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Geno having a ""great deep ball"". Seems like every time he's throwing it deep, he's overthrowing his man by about 5 yards."
nyjets,34yn2m,BigNuke43,3,Wed May 6 05:28:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I was thinking I chose my words wrong.  I think he has underrated arm strength cause he hasn't been able to throw it deep as often.  There was that thread in /r/NFL asking who had the worst arm in the league and a bunch of top rated answers were Geno Smith which I thought was ridiculous.  I agree his ball placement is iffy but apparently Devin Smith is adept at tracking the ball.  Geno hasn't exactly had great deep threat targets.
nyjets,34yn2m,jetsfan07,3,Wed May 6 05:37:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Geno absolutely has the arm strength, he just needs to hit his guys when he goes deep. One thing I'd be curious to see film on is his deep attempts and how well protection is. Cause, if the protection isn't good, it would be no wonder he couldn't hit the deep ball. If you're having to rush the throw because you've got DLinemen up in your facemask, I wouldn't expect you to have great accuracy.  So, really, I'd love to see our OL beefed up - especially at guard."
nyjets,34yn2m,CatfishHugo,8,Wed May 6 05:46:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know if anyone else noticed this, but Bryce Petty is turning 24 this month. He's basically the same age as Geno. May explain his drop a bit, teams like younger players around 20/21 so they can develop longer with the team."
nyjets,34yn2m,bit99,2,Tue May 5 17:48:51 2015 UTC,"Damn, if we develop him for 2 years (which I think is the right thing to do) he'll be 26.. older than Aaron Rodgers was when he finally got to start."
nyjets,34yn2m,tgrabowy717,2,Tue May 5 19:38:27 2015 UTC,"in between his senior year of High school and his junior year of college, there was 5 years."
nyjets,34yn2m,jetsfan07,0,Tue May 5 21:55:09 2015 UTC,"There was far more in Petty's ""drop"" than his age. In fact, You could (and I would) argue that 4th round was higher than he should have gone"
nyjets,34yn2m,Realistik84,0,Wed May 6 02:23:50 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, you don't drop to the fourth for just your age (Weeden). Just saying this guy isn't a bad developmental prospect, but his age kept him out of the 3rd"
nyjets,34yn2m,ThreeCranes,9,Wed May 6 11:03:54 2015 UTC,Never had weapons. Had shit coaching 3rd year is the year for most QBs to turn a corner He made a lot of stupid mistakes.  I am hopeful
nyjets,34yn2m,John_YJKR,2,Tue May 5 20:51:16 2015 UTC,"He lacks consistency,I can't trust any previous games of him whether good or bad because you just don't know what you're going to get out of him. I honestly feel like a healthy Fitzpatrick will beat him in a camp competition(hopefully we have a real competition instead of Fitzpatrick being insurance)."
nyjets,34yn2m,Shannon518,2,Tue May 5 19:34:57 2015 UTC,I think mac brought him in to run the offense. It makes a lot of sense. Geno is not their pick. They are not impressed with him. Fitz knows the system and is only 33. Good age veteran to have your guy learn behind. I'm not convinced they have their QB yet. They are doing their due diligence by giving Geno every opportunity to beat Fitz. I truly doubt he will though and I think they feel the same way.
nyjets,34yn2m,matts77,2,Tue May 5 20:45:41 2015 UTC,I think it's too early to tell. We did get new weapons for the offense. Marshall should make whoever is at qb better. Plus out defense is great and will take the pressure off our offense. Right now I believe fitzmagic gives us the best chance to win games. Camp will teach us a lot.
nyjets,34yn2m,AlbertHaynesworth,2,Tue May 5 21:18:48 2015 UTC,"I love Geno, and I still strongly believe he will be our franchise QB as well as a pro-bowl QB in the near future. I will be switching between my Revis and Geno jerseys weekly this season."
nyjets,34yn2m,Joslap,3,Tue May 5 22:34:18 2015 UTC,What improvement? And I don't mean that in a dickish way I mean it sincerely. Because I haven't seen any

nyjets,34yn2m,RoboFroogs,2,Tue May 5 21:59:41 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about his final game cmon lol. That was a game that meant nothing for either team and was way too little too late. Football isn't just about athletic ability, it's about what's between your ears too and with geno that scares me"
nyjets,34yn2m,sameolejets,2,Wed May 6 00:10:58 2015 UTC,"I want to believe, but I honestly think Rex Ryan ruins QBs with his stupid offensive ""philosophies"". Seriously, Mark Sanchez did at one point have some potential believe it or not. Maybe Geno is salvageable with a coaching staff that actually knows what they are doing and a WR depth chart of more than just injured Decker and rookie Amaro. There is hope but honestly I'm really hoping Fitzmagic starts and Petty picks up everything super quick."
nyjets,34yn2m,SolomonGunnEsq,1 point,Tue May 5 22:23:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its not like either Harvin or Kerley can catch a ball...  /s"
nyjets,34yn2m,wcstyles,2,Wed May 6 19:28:47 2015 UTC,"I am very curious to know what improvement you are seeing, because I saw a guy who was still making rookie mistakes through the end of last season. For instance, in Week 16 at the end of the game on a 3rd down play when the Jets are in field goal range and have the opportunity to win the game and everyone knows he is about to get blitzed and the only thing he can't do is take a sack, what does Geno do? He takes a sack. Then, the very next week in the very same situation to start the game, what does he do? Take a sack!  I'm done with him and the Jets should be too."
nyjets,34yn2m,mnmnstrd,4,Tue May 5 20:39:30 2015 UTC,You have to wonder how bad our coaching was though. I liked Rex but somehow no matter who played we always had an inept offense. I cant help but think they emphasized not throwing picks so much that by the time Geno wouldve thrown the ball away it was too late. If Geno sucks in camp or in the early season just move on. Start Fitz and cut Geno next year.
nyjets,34yn2m,SolomonGunnEsq,3,Tue May 5 22:59:18 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling our coaching staff had zero trust in Geno. You would never see him audible or pick up blitzes at the line. I can't imagine someone who has played football at a high level for this long would not recognize blitzes or be able to change plays at the line; I think there was a directive from Marty/Rex to run the plays as called. Geno used to torch teams in college when they blitzed on him. Between Marty's scripted first quarters, being forced to throw to Harvin against the Bills, I'm not sure if Geno is a bad QB or just played under a totally incompetent staff.   Hopefully Gailey is more competent and lets his QB run the show, because Geno seemed to play better when they let him do his thing when it was obvious the team was going to get blown up and people were going to get fired. Geno threw a 1/1 TD-INT ratio last year and lost a bunch of fumbles. He really needs to cut down on the INTs, and I think Gailey will be able to do that by running out 3, 4 WR sets with quick throws, with 4-5 deep bombs a game to Devin Smith to keep the secondary honest. I'm imagining an a lot of 11 personnel with Powell/Amaro in with Decker/Marshall/Kerley where he has 3 huge targets and a reliable RB for dump offs. Geno really thrived with spread concepts in college. I think a WCO was too difficult for a rookie QB coming out of the type of offense they ran at WVU. Gailey was brought along because he will adjust his offense to his personnel."
nyjets,34yn2m,mnmnstrd,3,Wed May 6 01:29:40 2015 UTC,"I get what you guys are saying, but he was the one throwing the balls and making the decisions. He has the tools, no doubt, but I'm unconvinced he has the smarts. Remember, the offense he played in at WVU only featured around 10 plays and most were simple variations of crossing routes so it's not like he has a body of work that leads you to believe he can handle more.   I would love Geno to be good, but I've seen enough to not want to waste any more time on him."
nyjets,34yn2m,rvbcaboose1018,1 point,Wed May 6 01:34:45 2015 UTC,"I think Geno will be given every opportunity to win the job because Fitzpatrick will be limited with the leg injury, but this regime has no ties to him. One or two stinkers in a row and they'll pull the plug and put Fitzpatrick in. I don't think Bowles will let Geno stink up the joint while he figures it out."
nyjets,34yn2m,sharked,1 point,Wed May 6 01:45:38 2015 UTC,"I think that with more work, a new offense scheme, and a new QB coach, Geno will do better than he did last year. If we somehow manage a miracle and get La'el, that would be another step in the right direction I think.    The question is, by how much will he improve? A little improvement will have us looking to draft a QB, but a big improvement could land us in the playoffs.   Only time will tell. I definitely want Geno to do well, but will he? That's the million dollar question. Now hes got 2 new targets, at least one new O linemen (please go up to 2) and decent running game options, So we shall see."
nyjets,34yn2m,tootie,1 point,Tue May 5 18:21:16 2015 UTC,I'll get back to you after he wins a legit QB competition.
nyjets,34yn2m,BigNuke43,1 point,Tue May 5 20:33:06 2015 UTC,"At this point it seems unlikely he will ever be a franchise QB. He should be given a fair shake in camp, but I think that barring injuries he's started his last NFL game."
nyjets,34yn2m,Shrimpola_Cola,1 point,Tue May 5 23:37:56 2015 UTC,"He's been awful-mediocre thus far, but has a chance to improve with more help at receiver and hopefully better protection from the OLine. I doubt he ever puts it together though, which is a shame. But, that's the NFL."
nyjets,34yn2m,darkknight915,1 point,Wed May 6 05:23:52 2015 UTC,"He stinks, I wouldn't give him more than four games unless he's improved quite a bit."

nyjets,34yn2m,DatGrag,1 point,Wed May 6 09:45:04 2015 UTC,8/29 ain't bad considering he's got two years under his belt.  It's not like we've seen 29 shit games.  He flashes then crashes.  We just need about as much flash with little to no crash and we're good.
nyjets,34yn2m,JawsThemeSwimming37,-2,Wed May 6 23:25:01 2015 UTC,Geno is really bad at football :(
nyjets,34yj8r,kenbrellfan,25,Tue May 5 16:57:18 2015 UTC,"Petty has bad accuracy, poor pocket awareness, bad mechanics, and no history in a pro system. He has never even learned a whole playbook. It is abundantly clear why he was available in the 4th, I even had a 6th round grade on him. He has the tools to be a good player, but he won't be close to ready for awhile"
nyjets,34yj8r,tgrabowy717,2,Tue May 5 17:36:25 2015 UTC,A la Tahj Boyd
nyjets,34yj8r,akaneel,2,Tue May 5 19:28:57 2015 UTC,"I'd have to give Petty the edge because I like his arm talent more and I don't think I've ever seen him spike a screen pass, but there are some similarities"
nyjets,34yj8r,tgrabowy717,2,Tue May 5 19:54:40 2015 UTC,His last segment on Gruden's QB Camp when he was on the field with receivers and linemen looked pretty bad. Called wrong protections and looked really uncomfortable. His senior bowl was similiar according to reports. It's going to be a long long road for Petty.
nyjets,34yj8r,kuyakew,1 point,Tue May 5 21:56:24 2015 UTC,"Also, something I didn't realize until I saw it in another thread, he is the same age as Geno!  Which means that at the same age Geno has two additional years experience in the NFL.  I would have more confidence in Geno since he has had some, albeit very little, success in the NFL."
nyjets,34yj8r,c39j8b,1 point,Tue May 5 19:07:28 2015 UTC,"Woo, i'm not the only one who hates it. Did you want Hundley with that pick too?"
nyjets,34yj8r,NannigarCire,2,Tue May 5 19:38:30 2015 UTC,"I certainly liked Hundley more, but I figured that we'd wait till next year to get a QB since the class is supposed to be deeper and this one was so top heavy. Even if we don't have a top pick next year it shouldn't be too difficult to trade into position to draft a QB with franchise player potential"
nyjets,34yj8r,tgrabowy717,0,Tue May 5 19:53:25 2015 UTC,"I legitimately think Hundley has franchise potential within him, so I would have wept with joy if we got him in the 4th. I have a really bad feeling now that he's in GB, that we'll be seeing the Bills trading for him in two-three years. Ted Thompson just knows QB prospects, he's gotten a ton of value out of the ones that have been scouted under him, going back to when he was director of scouting. I know next years class has some decent looking prospects, but i would have loved to take a guy like that in the 4th."
nyjets,34yj8r,NannigarCire,2,Tue May 5 22:29:23 2015 UTC,I honestly didn't like any QB with the 4th rounder.
nyjets,34yj8r,betarded,1 point,Tue May 5 22:23:18 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of either Hundley or Bonner? I wanted either with the 4th, saw them as really high potential prospects given that they had a very high starting point in all the major areas of QBing."
nyjets,34yj8r,NannigarCire,5,Tue May 5 22:27:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why he was a 4th rounder.   Really? He played in a system where he was never asked to actually read the defense, he played almost exclusively in the shotgun so he has worse mechanics than Geno when it comes to his feet, and he didn't really even have a playbook at Baylor so his capacity to learn complex plays from one is a pretty big question mark. He's also old for a rookie, so he's behind the learning curve even more.   I like the Petty pick, I really do, because his upside makes it worth the investment... But lets not pretend we got a steal in Petty at this stage, or that he's the next Russel Wilson situation, where teams overlooked him over something that ended up not mattering.   He's a big project, but with Geno (The incumbent) and Fitz (The Veteran) on our roster I think it made sense to add a high upside rookie to sit and learn."
nyjets,34yj8r,ZeroWF,2,Tue May 5 21:11:16 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why he was a 4th rounder.   There are too many unknowns about his ability to perform in a pro-style offense.  He's going to be a work in progress for a year or two.

nyjets,34yj8r,zarmin,3,Tue May 5 17:16:10 2015 UTC,"Deion Smith will probably not be on the team in 2-3 years. Jarvis Harrison could very easily bust and just be a depth player his entire career. His work ethic was and still remains a huge issue. Bryce Petty as a franchise QB is a joke. We won't know what we have from him for at least 2 years. He's a project and please try and remember what happened to the last project we drafted, Stephen Hill. Lorenzo Mauldin has a chip on his shoulder but life isn't fair man. You think just because he had a tough upbringing it will translate to the NFL. See Aaron Maybin. Being a good person doesn't mean you'll be great in the NFL, much less even make the team. Devin Smith has question marks but at least he won't be pressed to start with the world on his shoulders. Leonard Williams is in a good spot and the best athlete, but he also had a minor injury concern.  TL;DR Being a Jets fan means being realistic. This post sounds like we fleeced everyone when realistically, every team feels good right now. Maybe we get 2 starters this year, if we're lucky."
nyjets,34yj8r,woodyreturns,16,Tue May 5 18:52:36 2015 UTC,I bet you're great at parties
nyjets,34yj8r,Haywood_Jablowmi,3,Tue May 5 19:27:39 2015 UTC,"two starters?  our first three picks will be pushing for playing time this year.  I agree with your late round assessments, but I take exception to you describing any player after the 1st round as a 'potential bust.'  A 5th rounder can never be a bust.  Many dont even make the teams they are drafted to.  This draft was as good as any in terms of BPA and need - which were right on for us.  Are we going to field 6 all pros? no.  Will we have minimum 3 starters with some added roster depth?  Yes."
nyjets,34yj8r,CosmicWy,2,Tue May 5 19:59:27 2015 UTC,"I like the realist view, so you do you. people are gonna downvote it though, but it is absurd for someone to claim that half of our draft is pro-bowlers based off little other than intuition. The developmental jump and maturity required to move from the college game to the NFL game is something none of us have the ability to gauge. Much better prospects than the ones we've drafted have failed."
nyjets,34yj8r,NannigarCire,3,Tue May 5 19:40:07 2015 UTC,"Not sure how you got ""half of our draft is pro-bowlers"" from my comments. Go back and re-read them. I said that I predict one player is a future all-pro, which of course means he'd be a pro bowler as well. That's 1/6."
nyjets,34yj8r,NannigarCire,2,Tue May 5 22:29:23 2015 UTC,"Okay, what are you predicting that based off of though? You said Jarvis Harrison will be a pro-bowler, can you explain what you've seen out of him that makes that a possible reality? Also, what makes you think Maudlin will be a solid starter? I've watched plenty of Maudlin's tape and think he's best suited as a role pass rusher, and probably shouldn't be on the field at all during run downs. I mean, the vibe from your post is ""yeah i feel good about this draft"" and it's just optimistic nausea imo. This subreddit has a huge bad habit of bi-polarity where there's either unrealistic optimism or it's unrealistic pessimism, depending on how new the people in charge are."
nyjets,34yj8r,NannigarCire,0,Tue May 5 22:33:11 2015 UTC,"Read my comments word for word. I said Harrison has pro-bowl talent, but his work ethic concerns mean he's a big if to even start for us.  I said that I think Mauldin could be a solid starter for us. Meaning, if he pans out, he will be a solid starter. And I agree he's probably better suited as a role pass rusher.  There's nothing unrealistic about my post. Yes it has a positive tone to it, but I don't understand how saying that Harrison could be an excellent starter for us if he improves his work ethic is unrealistically optimistic.   If you think my comment about Petty was unrealistically optimistic, that means you didn't think it was a good pick. Because you wouldn't trade up and use a 4th round pick on a guy you think doesn't have a legitimate shot at being your franchise guy. Keep in mind ""legitimate shot"" does not mean ""100% FRANCHISE QB 2015""  My most unrealistically optimistic comment was actually Williams. He's the only guy who I didn't include any hedges or ifs."
nyjets,34yj8r,NannigarCire,1 point,Tue May 5 22:49:39 2015 UTC,"Okay, but my question wasn't what you think- it's why you think that. You didn't answer any of that, what have you seen from watching these guys that makes you think any of that? It comes off as optimistic nausea because there's no reasoning for any of what you said.  Potential is also a dangerous word with Petty, seeing as, in order for him to develop into a franchise QB he'd have to do things that he's never even shown he can do, even in spurts. Any QB is a 'potential franchise QB' in reality, and it's also another part of the optimistic nausea I mentioned."
nyjets,34yj8r,Holy-Upvotes-Batman,2,Tue May 5 22:52:17 2015 UTC,"I didn't respond to your question because you continued to draw false conclusions about what I wrote. So now that you understand what I wrote, I can tell you why I think what I think.  Harrison - I've seen him bully good college defensive lineman. He's very athletic for his size and has exceptionally quick feet. He was actually a high school basketball player, which can kind of explain why his feet are so quick. An AFC Executive had this to say about him    I believe he has Pro Bowl caliber talent, but his work ethic is a major concern for me. I know he loves basketball, but not sure if he feels the same about football. The talent? That's a given. He's really, really talented.   Mauldin - I watched the kid a lot at Louisville (I go to a big east school and got to see him play a couple of times live), and I've always been impressed with him. Seems to have a very high motor, good athleticism and a knack for getting to the QB. You're right he's probably more of a role pass rusher. Again I said I'm not crazy about this guy but he could be a starter.  Devin Smith - I watched some tape on him and I'm just very impressed with his ability to get separation. Very fast, very quick, led all of BCS in yards per reception with something like 28. He ran a limited route tree in college but I still think he has potential to be very good in the league if he can develop.  Petty - I'm impressed with his size, arm strength, accuracy and I'm also very impressed with him as a person. He works hard, he's intelligent, and I think if you're a hard working, intelligent kid with the right tools, you have a shot at being something special. There are some big ifs with him, he can't make pro reads yet, there are some questions about his accuracy, but I believe he will develop into a starting NFL QB and has a shot at being our franchise guy based on what I've seen from him."
nyjets,34yj8r,woodyreturns,2,Tue May 5 23:06:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding, this one's a lot better than the original post. I'm disagreeing heavily on Petty's NFL potential, but that's my personal opinion."

I said Petty has a legitimate shot at being our franchise QB, not he WILL be our franchise THIS YEAR.   I said I'm not crazy about Mauldin but he could be a starter for us.  I said Devin Smith has potential to be a great receiver.  And yeah I was pretty blunt with Leonard Williams so if you want to say I'm wrong about that one go ahead.  I just want you to know that your comment basically agrees with mine 100%, just put in different terms. It's like you didn't actually read each word in my post, just kinda glanced through it and saw words like ""Jarvis Harrison"" and ""pro-bowl""."

More like outside chance or slim to none possibility that he starts for any team.  Bottomline, anyone could be a starter in this draft. We don't know, but your post is ridiculously optimistic which is typical wishful thinking for fanatics after every draft."

nyjets,34xy6q,G1az3d,15,Tue May 5 14:11:40 2015 UTC,I am just glad that we will for once be able to actually let a rookie QB sit on the bench and learn for a year or two instead of throwing him right in spotlight.   He certainly has a great additude though and seems to understand the value that getting that one or two years can bring. I am liking this pick more and more.
nyjets,34xy6q,games456,4,Tue May 5 14:47:35 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it did look like we were gonna try that with Geno. Sanchez's preseason injury ended that possibility, though."
nyjets,34xy6q,matap821,2,Tue May 5 17:51:58 2015 UTC,"yeah. Geno was entering the year as the backup, and he got pushed into the spotlight too early.   Now though, with Petty presumably entering the season as a QB3, we have that extra layer of insurance to make sure he develops.   I'd love to see him get a start in preseason week 4 though. Its a meaningless game, but I think it can be a good gauge of what the team is working with."
nyjets,34xy6q,rvbcaboose1018,1 point,Tue May 5 18:25:40 2015 UTC,I agree completely. I think we should stick with Geno (or Fitz if Geno still can't cut it) and have an option at QB when it comes time to look at QB contract extensions.

He has a great work ethic and I think,he is in a spot where he knows he could start day 1 of he puts in enough work. I like Petty. He reminds me of Tony Romo really. Obviously that's a lofty comparison but I think we picked the 2nd or 3rd best developmental guy in this draft besides Mariota and Grayson. I'm 2 years, it wouldn't shock me to see Petty as our starter and be average to good."

We'll lose to the Colts and maybe Texans, Jags and Titans should be easy, but Tennessee always gives us a fight.   We'll lose in Oakland because we always do, and I don't know the Browns well enough to make a call.   This would put us at 10-6 if I count all the maybes as wins, but I think it'll be closer to 8-8 or 9-7."

The Bills on the other hand didn't get a first round pick this year, and although it's waaaay to early to call their draft necessarily bad, most fans I've seen don't seem too thrilled. They don't have a lot going for them on the offensive side of the ball, and we all have firsthand experience of Rex's history with offense. Their defense will be great, obviously, but from an outsider's perspective they look a lot like we did under Rex these last few years, a slightly anemic offense that relies on their defense to keep them in games."

nyjets,34tuhm,beckett360,53,Mon May 4 15:23:10 2015 UTC,"When this type of stuff happens, it usually happens after the draft because when GMs get hired in January, there has already been 8-9 months' worth of work put in for the draft and you can't just throw all that away (and also potentially risk other teams reaching out to the fired guy to find out your draft strategy) 3-4 months before the draft."

nyjets,34tuhm,GreatOdinsRaven_,0,Mon May 4 14:54:15 2015 UTC,"While I agree that it was long overdue, the timing seems kind of odd.

That being said, MacDaddy has my full faith."
nyjets,34tuhm,jaydough,7,Mon May 4 15:21:11 2015 UTC,"The timing makes sense to me. I think MacDaddy has been aware of the Jets scouting team being garbage since before even signing with the team, but you can't just sack everyone immediately after coming in and hire an entire new staff of scouts expecting to make up for a year's worth of scouting in the three/four months prior to the draft. What they've got is more valuable than whoever your new hire is going to get, regardless of if they're incompetent or poorly managed, or whatever the problem was there. So I guess now is the time to do it if you're going to do it."
nyjets,34tuhm,Rugger11,4,Mon May 4 15:25:45 2015 UTC,"It is the issue with draft research that has been put into the ""project"" of getting ready for the draft.

nyjets,34uerc,Deigs,1 point,Mon May 4 23:46:22 2015 UTC,"i don't think that gives them value at all... most of these GMs had teams of scouts look at these guys and every team decided not to take them. A couple of people who rank prospects for news outlets just ranked them higher than the average GM, so now the average NFL fan calls it ""value"".  edit: I don't think this is the case with Williams though (who actually was a great value pick). He just slid because there were 2 QB hungry teams ahead of us, the Jaguars who just happened to prefer Fowler, the Raiders who needed to give Carr a weapon to see if he was the real deal, and the Redskins who... ya I have no idea but coveted Scherff for some reason. So we got a top 3 talent at 6."
nyjets,34uerc,will1119,1 point,Mon May 4 23:52:38 2015 UTC,So in your eyes please define value for me. Cause in my eyes you just defined value instead of just using the term.
nyjets,34uerc,Deigs,1 point,Tue May 5 00:17:43 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand what you're trying to ask here. I just don't like the article because all it's doing is putting together a team of guys who went lower than most analysts expected... that's not ""value"". If these guys were being passed on by multiple NFL GMs (who spent a lot of time looking at every player) then there must be a reason for it. Just because some player fell multiple rounds doesn't make it a value pick, that means every single GM agreed that these players were not worth their picks in the round where analysts thought they were .   Basiaclly, there is no way to asses the ""value"" of a pick a week after the draft. In fact, analyzing and giving draft grades at all a week after the draft doesn't even make sense. You need to wait at least a few years to see how these guys pan out first. If Ryan leaf had fallen to #10 in his class everyone would be saying ""OMG what great value."" And you'd hear about it for weeks as the steal of the draft. But in reality, he ends up flopping and some team just lost a top 10 pick.  The other group of guys on this ""value"" list are guys with high upside, but who are unlikely to actually pan out. Mocks had Ifo Ekpre-Olomu being drafted all over the place. In the end, he fell to the 7th because round after round every GM decided he wasn't worth the risk given the severity of his injury. Could he pull through and end up being a steal? Of course. Is it likely? Not at all. That's why he kept getting passed on, until the Browns decided he was worth the risk of a 7th round pick.   TL;DR   Post draft analysis is a waste of time because no one knows anything about how any of these guys will end up. There is no such thing as a sure thing in the NFL. A potential top talent who fell due to a serious injury isn't value, it's a risk with potential upside GMs know more than analysts. All this article does is point out guys who the analysts overhyped   So hopefully somewhere in there your ambiguous question was answered."
nyjets,34uerc,will1119,2,Tue May 5 00:38:23 2015 UTC,Thank you.  Someone with a realistic mindset.  MOST players who enter the NFL don't pan out.  That includes top prospects.  Look at any draft class and see how many players become All Pros or just average NFL starters.  It really is just a crapshoot.  A highly regarded prospect is just as likely to fail as the next guy.  You can celebrate all you want now and talk about how great 'value' a pick is but nobody knows right now whether Williams is the next hall of fame player or just another Vernon Gholston.
nyjets,34uerc,Empire48,1 point,Tue May 5 03:09:25 2015 UTC,"This overstates the proposition.  Of course, player's careers can take unexpected turns for the worse.  But it is not just a crapshoot.  The reason Mac Daddy fired five scouts was because he's got evidence that scouting matters.  A good scout who can identify lasting talent in college players is invaluable to a football team, even if some drafted players later implode.  If that weren't true, Woody would have replaced Idzik with a random number generator to run the draft."
nyjets,34uerc,guccibento,1 point,Wed May 6 20:25:02 2015 UTC,"Scouting absolutely matters.  I wasn't trying to imply that it doesn't.  However, if you look through any draft most players don't make it.  It's been 3 years since the 2012 draft so I will use that as an example.  A lot of people debated who would be better between Luck and RG III.  We all know the winner by now.  Trent Richardson went #3 overall.  We can go down the list and see who has panned out and who hasn't.  A few notables from that draft are Alshon Jeffery (45th pick), Russell Wilson (75th pick), TY Hilton (92nd pick), and Alfred Morris (173rd pick).  Scouting matters to a certain extent, but nobody knows how talented college players will transition to the pros.  It is a crapshoot, but like with any poker game, there is some skill involved (scouting).    Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't Rex a big fan of Vernon Gholston?  And Rex is a defensive mastermind who can evaluate talent on the defensive side.  I'm not calling him a true scout but the guy knows what he is doing, and even he was dead wrong on Gholston."
nyjets,34uerc,Empire48,1 point,Thu May 7 02:29:06 2015 UTC,"Okay, I think we basically agree.  I count more non-Vernon Gholstons in our draft history than Vernon Gholstons though."

nyjets,34vxgl,GV22,2,Tue May 5 14:56:33 2015 UTC,"Just going off his stats, he averages 4 yards per carry and will probably fumble the ball twice in 14-16 games. As a receiving back, he doesn't have much hope there at all.   He is young, has been on a winning team his whole career and is looking to have a huge bounce back year. IMO he is worth the 1 year deal we signed him too."
nyjets,34vxgl,underclass4,1 point,Tue May 5 12:39:49 2015 UTC,"Never really saw the point in picking him up since we need a pass catcher RB more and after playing fantasy football the last couple years I could tell you that he's just a power back that can't really hold on to the ball so he is unnecessary to have, especially with our depth. He also has knee problems And I'm pretty sure there are better options that went undrafted this year."

nyjets,34vxgl,pungsvett,1 point,Wed May 6 02:20:17 2015 UTC,It actually is because you basically study the player on your team (Ridley) for that whole year and begin to realize their strengths and weaknesses and how they contribute to your team.

Quinton Coples doesn't rack up numbers every Sunday but his presence and play is very beneficial to our defense.  There are a lot of hustle plays and smart decisions that don't show up on the stat sheets.  Although I understand that it's slightly different for defensive player.
nyjets,34vxgl,pungsvett,2,Wed May 6 03:15:43 2015 UTC,I feel ya. I've been watching Ridley as a fantasy football player and he was frustrating to watch. When he has open field he's decent but his ball handling can be pretty shit. I'd take Chris ivory and Powell over ridley. Maybe even stacy too.

The draft just ended yes, but the scouting department starts working for next years draft in 2-4 weeks. So he wants to bring in his own guys for next years draft. The reason they weren't let go as soon as he came here was because they already had done months of work leading up to this draft."

nyjets,34trhz,jetsfan07,2,Mon May 4 15:35:31 2015 UTC,"On paper, yes, just like every other team's draft. But no games have been played yet, so it's not like the draft has yielded us 6 starters with 2 or more pro bowlers. We don't know if these guys will even be competing for playing time in 3 years.   I'd guess the guys that got fired were slacking off, inefficient or bad talent evaluators. Every group carries dead weight."
nyjets,34trhz,FromAshyToClassy,2,Mon May 4 14:37:56 2015 UTC,"Think about their job, the new scouting department is going to get to work soon for the 2016 draft. So these guys that were just let go had been working on who to draft for the recent draft for almost a year now. You can't let them go right before all the work they did can even show.

nyjets,34trhz,TresOcho,1 point,Mon May 4 15:01:29 2015 UTC,You don't fire them before the draft because they've basically spent the whole last year scouting all the incoming talent and you don't wanna just throw that all away 4 months before the draft.

nyjets,34rwbo,LaFours23,12,Mon May 4 02:02:21 2015 UTC,I thought it was one of the guys from LMFAO
nyjets,34rwbo,hammer-hands,6,Mon May 4 02:10:42 2015 UTC,dude's gonna be killer
nyjets,34rwbo,viewless25,8,Mon May 4 02:57:08 2015 UTC,Wonder what happens if big Mo has a huge insane season Going into his contract year. Gonna be some very difficult decisions to be made. I really really do not wanna lose big Mo. So tired of having top players at their position only to lose them and watching then dominate on some other team which will happen. He's gotta be the second best at his position behind JJ Watt. So tired of losing home grown talent only to watch them go to another team and be even more dominate. I have a feeling in our new coaches system he's gonna be even better than he has been. He's just gonna continue to get better and better. But hey if he's not traded atleast we get to watch him on this line just dominate. Gonna be interesting to see what teams try and pick who to double cause they can't double them all. Gonna be fun for a yr atleast to watch.
nyjets,34rwbo,cstpreditin,5,Mon May 4 03:20:12 2015 UTC,"I mean, if we trad him, there's a couple of good things about it: to trade Wilk, we'd likely be getting a nice big return. Also, we'd likely be trying to trade him out of the conference, and certainly out of the division, so he wouldn't really be able to torment us.  Of course, I hope we're able to get a deal done and keep him. Still, if Sheldon continues his upward trend, he's also going to be getting big money. And, if Leo lives up to his mammoth expectations, he's most DEFINITELY going to be a big money guy. So, either way, there most definitely is going to be a decision that has to be made regarding one of these guys at some point. At that point, I think you keep the two guys with the highest ceilings. But, man oh man, what a great problem to have, eh?"
nyjets,34rwbo,BigNuke43,3,Mon May 4 04:37:37 2015 UTC,"with the franchise tag, we are looking at least another 2-3 years of Mo, even without long term commitment.  That's not bad.  Plenty of time to see Richardson continue developing.  To see what Williams has to offer and to make a decision on who to keep.  The draft has given me hope in our GM, he isn't an idiot.  If he can't sign em, I'm sure he will get a nice trade package in return."
nyjets,34rwbo,donat28,1 point,Mon May 4 12:39:29 2015 UTC,No way we can afford to franchise him.  Franchise tag on DL has to be a monster number.
nyjets,34rwbo,Nadtastic,1 point,Mon May 4 12:59:43 2015 UTC,It's not too far off.  DE franchise like $14.8m and I assume Mo is probably looking for a AAV in the $14m range.
nyjets,34rwbo,redworld,1 point,Mon May 4 13:11:50 2015 UTC,"na you can do it for a year or two.  About 14m for the year.  Perfectly acceptable for a season.  Even the year after that it won't be too bad - something like 16-18M for the year.  Large numbers, yes, but that's why GMs get paid big bucks - to sort these messes."

nyjets,34rwbo,Pm_me_your_flipphone,3,Mon May 4 01:28:16 2015 UTC,Fear the 'fro
nyjets,34rwbo,aintevenmadbrah,3,Mon May 4 01:34:53 2015 UTC,"""Luckily"" for us, we don't have a QB to pay. Even if Geno turns it on, he wouldn't have to be paid until the after the 2017 season on his 2nd round rookie contract. It's more likely we draft another starting QB who makes little money, which makes it easier to keep Mo/Sheldon. We will have 5 years of Leonard at a low salary so we can keep these guys locked up for a while.   We'll likely have new starters at LT, C and MLB by the time Sheldon and Leonard need to get paid, who won't make as much as Ferguson and Mangold do. And with the cap seemingly going up $10 million every year, I think we'll be able to keep the gang together. Maccagnan has shown that he can manage the cap well with how all of the contracts have been negotiated thus far."
nyjets,34rwbo,mnmnstrd,2,Mon May 4 13:32:44 2015 UTC,"Whether Big Mo gets traded or not, lets just hope he has a healthy and productive year. I would hate to see him get hurt just like Revis did in 2012 giving the front office built in excuse to get what they could just like Idzik did with the Buccaneers. Hopefully the team gets off to a hot start, and Mo gets extended early on in the season so we don't have to have this burden over us any longer. I think thats best case scenario."
nyjets,34rwbo,RealMarkSanchez,2,Mon May 4 08:04:33 2015 UTC,It is insane that he isn't even 21 yet and he was already a 2x all american
nyjets,34rwbo,Biscuitt,2,Mon May 4 12:47:39 2015 UTC,"I honestly think this team has a good shot at the playoffs.  With how much talent we have on defense, I can't imagine allowing more than 14 or so points per game.  And while neither Fitzpatrick or Smith are guys that are going to carry a team to a winning record, with a good O-line, a solid stable of running backs, and a talented and deep group of receivers, I think either of them, especially Fitzpatrick, are capable of putting up at least 17 points a game without turning the ball over so much that it kills us.  I'm not saying they'll win the division or make a deep playoff run, though the only thing that I can see holding them back from either is quarterback play, but I definitely think they'll at least be in the playoff hunt in the last week or two of the season."

nyjets,34tsev,_blurhe,17,Mon May 4 14:49:06 2015 UTC,Mine was Petty and he got drafted to the Jets!
nyjets,34tsev,Mopia09,6,Mon May 4 14:46:28 2015 UTC,"Malcolm Brown to the Pats was rough. Not that I particularly wanted him for us, but he was a player that fell and went to the Pats at a position they need."
nyjets,34tsev,sjets3,2,Mon May 4 16:31:11 2015 UTC,I thought Trey Flowers was even worse. I was hoping he would be our pick in the 3rd.
nyjets,34tsev,SolomonGunnEsq,2,Mon May 4 18:31:19 2015 UTC,As a Longhorns fan its rough.
nyjets,34tsev,ThreeCranes,5,Mon May 4 21:44:32 2015 UTC,Stefon Diggs to the Vikings. He's had to suffer wayyyy too many bad QB's at Maryland

nyjets,34tsev,woodchips24,1 point,Mon May 4 16:45:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's shown some potential, but I was kinda hoping he would go somewhere with an established QB. I guess ""bad"" was the wrong choice of words"
nyjets,34tsev,jaykyew,3,Mon May 4 16:48:17 2015 UTC,"He fell to the 5th round, it was really a crapshoot of where he was gonna go at that point. But I think his bigger issue is staying healthy"
nyjets,34tsev,woodchips24,8,Mon May 4 16:55:52 2015 UTC,I really really wanted the Jet to grab Grayson.
nyjets,34tsev,kuyakew,3,Mon May 4 15:16:47 2015 UTC,All i wanted was Nightwing to be the Jets QB
nyjets,34tsev,JNaps95,3,Mon May 4 19:10:48 2015 UTC,Seriously. But good for him. He fell into a great developmental situation in New Orleans.
nyjets,34tsev,John_YJKR,2,Tue May 5 00:40:20 2015 UTC,Eli Harold to the 49ers. I wanted us to get him in the third round so badly
nyjets,34tsev,bluesilver12,2,Mon May 4 15:35:39 2015 UTC,"I was real high on Zach Zenner, he was an UDFA and signed with Detroit so no big threat but this kid had three consecutive 2000yd seasons, and over 1000 yards of receiving in his career. Small school at South Dakota St but you look for guys who dominate that competition and that's exactly what he did. He also had huge games against tougher competition to boot. Coulda been great in Chan's system at a great value. Oh well!"
nyjets,34tsev,mosherd14,2,Mon May 4 16:09:20 2015 UTC,"Amari Cooper. I'm in no way upset that we weren't able to get him especially after getting Williams instead, but I don't think we'll get to see how great of a player he really is with Carr throwing to him."
nyjets,34tsev,Deigs,1 point,Mon May 4 18:15:36 2015 UTC,If Carr fails to develop I expect Cooper to become the new Larry Fitzgerald. Elite talent. no QB.

nyjets,34tsev,Nebkreb,1 point,Mon May 4 16:02:41 2015 UTC,I thought he was a 4-5 rounder. I can't believe we got him as a UDFA. Same goes for Taiwan Jones. Monster pick ups by Big Mac.
nyjets,34tsev,LDYo,1 point,Mon May 4 16:16:25 2015 UTC,Eskridge and Jones were such amazing UDFA pickups. Topped off how good the draft was to me. Mac and co did hell of a job.
nyjets,34tsev,ThreeCranes,1 point,Tue May 5 01:31:41 2015 UTC,I wanted Hickey too
nyjets,34tsev,IKetchBodies,1 point,Mon May 4 21:45:03 2015 UTC,"I really liked Kevin White and I think he's going to be way more impactful than Cooper. I'm happy we got Williams but, I think if he didn't surprisingly fall to us, White was our choice."
nyjets,34tsev,Deigs,2,Mon May 4 18:26:48 2015 UTC,I think there's no doubt Cooper will be the better of the two. He doesn't lose a step breaking his routes which allows an intense amount of separation. That is what you're looking for. White's tape looks incredible because he can catch in traffic. You don't see much of that in Cooper's tape cause he has the ability to consistently get wide open.
nyjets,34tsev,John_YJKR,1 point,Mon May 4 23:37:25 2015 UTC,I see Cooper as the next Antonio brown. I see white as the next Brandon Marshall. They are different style receivers. Both will be good.
nyjets,34trve,Lukas327,2,Mon May 4 14:27:11 2015 UTC,"Well have to see what kind of blocking scheme we end up using in OTAs/minicamp. Gailey preferred a ZBS in Buffalo, and I don't think that Ivory is a very good fit in that kind of system. On a side note, our offensive line has previously run a power scheme, so I'll be interested in seeing if we end up starting more athletic guards, rather than maulers like Colon. Carpenter and Giacomini played in a ZBS in Seattle, but I don't think many people were pleased with them on the line.   Ivory is more of a power back, and he doesn't offer much as a receiver, though he did improve a little last season as a checkdown option. I think we'll see more of Powell this year than we did in 2014. Depending on how Ivory fits in Gailey's scheme, I would not be 100% shocked if he's a cap causality in camp with the level of RB depth we have at the moment. Since it's the last year of his contract, he could be expendable if Ridley is healthy and Stacy/Richardson show something in camp. Cutting Ivory is a $2 million cap savings.   Ridley will likely start the season on the PUP, so we would likely have a depth chart of Ivory, Powell and Stacy. I don't see us carrying a fullback on this roster; I think Kellen Davis can play the role of TE/H-Back well enough to let go of Bohanon."
nyjets,34trve,mnmnstrd,11,Mon May 4 15:24:45 2015 UTC,"I would be absolutely shocked if the Jets cut Ivory. He is far and away our best back, I would rank him in the top-15 of all RBs at the moment. His biggest concern throughout his career has been injuries yet, partly because we've established a RB by committee approach, he has been healthy throughout his time here.   I just don't see any legitimate reasons not to hold onto him at least until he becomes a free agent. $2 million is nothing compared to his added value to this team, IMO."
nyjets,34trve,Axel3419,2,Mon May 4 23:08:01 2015 UTC,"I think it'll be determined by personnel groups and downs. If we have a receiver-heavy personnel group, Powell will be in because he's both the most talented blocker and has the best hands of the group. Then again, if it's a third and short with our blocking TEs and Marshall and Decker lined up together, you'll see Stacy/Ridley and Bohannon telegraphing the run and going with it because they're absolute monsters.   If it's a 3rd and medium, you'll likely see Stacy/Ridley and Powell in a split back formation for maximum pass protect.   Ivory will be used in most first down situations barring injury. We'll see what we do for goal line, but one of the power backs will be there and we will tailor the play to the look we get and to every team's defense.   If we know they have terrible CB depth, you'll see us pass. If they can't stop the run, we'll run. If they line up in a way we really like, we'll audible and exploit the defensive package. And we'll always have fresh legs to churn the ball in.  Someone is not going to be happy. But with the way Ivory/Ridley/Stacy run, injuries are absolutely a concern. Ivory spent most of the season with nagging hamstring or quad injuries. Ridley got injured as well.   I'd rather have the depth there so SOMEONE is operating at 100% all season long, preserving the 4.0 yards per carry average... and more importantly, the fact that we KNOW we'll get 3 yards every time one of them touches the ball. Keeping these guys fresh will be key to retaining that fact."
nyjets,34trve,otomotopia,2,Mon May 4 15:28:45 2015 UTC,Fantasy football and getting a guy in the pro-bowl can sometimes seem more important than positional success. I'd rather the position succeed than draft a Jets RB in fantasy football.
nyjets,34trve,Killsitty,2,Mon May 4 18:00:58 2015 UTC,"Haha me too man. I usually like to draft a few Jets players so I can be extra happy when they do well, but there's no way in hell I'm touching this backfield in fantasy."
nyjets,34trve,botticus51,2,Mon May 4 20:42:33 2015 UTC,"I kind of get the feeling Bowles isn't high on Ivory.  I don't know why, but just from the moves that have made I think they're not really sold on him."
nyjets,34trve,Shrimpola_Cola,6,Mon May 4 17:14:58 2015 UTC,IMO it seems like everyone in the AFC East who hasn't committed to a long term QB yet (see: Jets and Bills) are loading up on as many RBs as possible. Gotta keep a lot of fresh legs around if you're going to run all the time.
nyjets,34trve,mid90s,2,Mon May 4 17:59:40 2015 UTC,"I think Ivory will still be the lead guy if he is healthy.  Either Zac Stacy or Stevan Ridley will be the guys that primarily spell Ivory...Bilal Powell comes in for passing downs, receiving ability..etc.  Just one man's opinion."
nyjets,34trve,alanschech,1 point,Mon May 4 19:49:56 2015 UTC,"Zac Stacy and Ridley and Powell can all block, so they'll have a foot up on Ivory. None of them are good pass-catchers though, and really no one on this team is, nor are they speedy.   I see Ridley being a 3-down back, Ivory will sub in sometimes on 1st and 2nd down, and on most short-yardage situations. Powell can get some third-down snaps.   But it'll be around 45% Ridley, 35% Ivory, 20% Powell.   Stacy can come in if someone is injured, and I can see Devin Smith taking some snaps in the backfield to simulate some speed."
nyjets,34trve,earl_smith_thethird,1 point,Mon May 4 16:20:02 2015 UTC,I agree. I think ridley will take over primary duties and ivory will get the short yardage carries. It suits them better. We need a legit skatback. Stacy is here to increase competition and be a just in case option. Who knows? He may actually out perform one of the others in camp.
nyjets,34trve,John_YJKR,1 point,Tue May 5 00:38:13 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping Ivory is the lead back and gets the most carries. His running style looks like he wants to punish someone every play but my big problem is he is best when he can wear a team down, to me seems less effective when they switch him out every other down (I realize he can't block or catch well though). He is very injury prone and skipped practices frequently last year to stay fresh. I don't want to be counting on him for 16 games so the Ridley and Stacy moves are great."
nyjets,34trve,zeusthewilliams,-1,Mon May 4 20:37:03 2015 UTC,"Powell will be the lead back barring surprises, IMO. Gailey likes to have the RB as a check down and uses a few screens, both of which Ivory isn't great at. Ivory will probably be used in goal line/obvious run situations. Zac Stacy and Stevan Ridley will be fighting for one of those two positions, if not both, I'd guess. I don't really know what they're good at, but I doubt their minimum contracts/value will give them any advantage over the incumbents."
nyjets,34trve,jetsfan07,7,Mon May 4 14:33:31 2015 UTC,I really don't see Powell being the lead back. I think Ivory had proven that he should remain the #1 back. I think the other 3 will rotate situationally.
nyjets,34trve,Itsascrnnam,1 point,Mon May 4 14:44:53 2015 UTC,"By lead back I mean highest % of snaps, since Powell is actually competent at screens, check downs, running and blocking. Ivory is too one dimensional, he can run well, somewhat okay blocker, bad everything else."
nyjets,34trve,jetsfan07,2,Mon May 4 14:53:23 2015 UTC,I really dont recall many screens from Powell... I dunno
nyjets,34trve,mwax321,1 point,Mon May 4 15:56:45 2015 UTC,There are large sects of Powell fans on just about every Jets forum. I like him as a 3rd down back and a handful of carries a game sort of runner but Ivory and Ridley should be our Super Smash bros.
nyjets,34s5gh,chris_ri,15,Mon May 4 02:29:13 2015 UTC,I'm working on that! Still a few bugs with the new flair system... but for now he's in the header!

Right now, with him not being eligible for 2016, the only thing keeping him from a team is the report on the murder, which i believe comes tomorrow.   I dont know if hes picking up to teams, but I imagine the second hes cleared, hell have 30 phonecalls at the same time.   Issue right now is, he gets to choose. everyone is offering the same amount. Its his choice from the looks of it, so as much as I would want him, at the same time, its not our call. Its his."
nyjets,34scpb,rvbcaboose1018,2,Mon May 4 04:42:07 2015 UTC,"He'd be crazy to come here and not go somewhere like Seattle or New England. Assuming he's innocent, he can literally pick exactly where he wants to play."
nyjets,34scpb,Manginaz,1 point,Mon May 4 15:39:40 2015 UTC,That's why I'm surprised no one took him in the 7th. Isn't the potential for value worth the relative risk since most 7th rounders aren't making an impact anyway?
nyjets,34scpb,NRA4eva,2,Mon May 4 18:43:19 2015 UTC,"Since he said he wouldn't go anywhere he was drafted, I think that anyone that tried to draft him would pretty much guarantee he wasn't going to play for them and would be throwing away a pick, even though it was likely a worthless one."
nyjets,34scpb,Manginaz,2,Mon May 4 19:02:20 2015 UTC,"But what choice would he have? If he's drafted by a team, doesn't he have to play for that team or not at all?"
nyjets,34scpb,NRA4eva,3,Mon May 4 19:09:32 2015 UTC,"If I read right, if he'd been drafted and declined to sign, he could've re-entered the '16 draft. By going completely undrafted, that made him ineligible to go back in."

nyjets,34scpb,korkyshadow,1 point,Mon May 4 21:40:05 2015 UTC,They don't pay nor really can they though. I think he goes somewhere that can play him after this UDFA contract.
nyjets,34scpb,mnmnstrd,6,Mon May 4 21:28:15 2015 UTC,"I'd love to have him. He'd immediately take over at RT. You could push Giac inside to guard, and have a lineup of Ferguson/Carpenter/Mangold/Giac/Collins. However, with a UDFA salary, he could literally go to any team in the NFL because he won't have any effect on a team's cap.  I'd imagine he'd choose a contender with a shaky tackle situation where he could slide right into their line. He can't get paid for a few years anyway, so he'll likely go to a team like the Patriots, Colts, Giants, etc."
nyjets,34scpb,Rugger11,3,Mon May 4 13:14:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know if he'd go to a contender. I'd think he would go to whichever team he'd have the most playing time. That way after his UDFA contract is up, he can make up the big bucks he wants. If he sits behind someone on a contender, it could hurt his future earning potential."
nyjets,34scpb,jgangstahippie,1 point,Mon May 4 14:46:47 2015 UTC,"Though if he is cleared mid-preseason, I could see him wanting to go to a place where he can redshirt a year and learn from vets. But you hit it on the head, he needs to establish value fast!"
nyjets,34scpb,SeeDeez,2,Tue May 5 06:26:46 2015 UTC,But we're on the cusp of being a contender with a shakey tackle scenario. And there's a lot of positive hype surrounding us for a change.
nyjets,34scpb,the_furry_stoner,1 point,Mon May 4 13:31:06 2015 UTC,"Plus, Todd Bowles seems like a good HC to be around for a troubled player. If you heard him on the phone with that LOU player we drafted he just sounds like a good coach to have if you have issues."

nyjets,34scpb,dumbego,1 point,Tue May 5 01:04:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's restricted to the UDFA salary range, which is significantly lower than he would have made as a first round pick."
nyjets,34scpb,subrhyme,1 point,Tue May 5 14:46:45 2015 UTC,"If he's innocent, he'll basically have his pick of where he wants to go.  I would be surprised if any team DIDN""T offer him the max UDFA salary."
nyjets,34scpb,subrhyme,1 point,Wed May 6 14:39:58 2015 UTC,"I know its no consolation prize but he'll at least be able to restructure before drafted rookies would.  So if he comes in and is lighting it up he can cash in in 2 years as opposed to 4.  Sometimes that sets up for a more favorable contract path, you can set up favorable years on contracts and maybe even squeeze out an extra contract.  The downside is obvious, if you get hurt or suck, you've got nanz!.  If he truly is innocent, I feel really sorry for him.  That blows!"
nyjets,34scpb,Realistik84,2,Wed May 6 14:39:01 2015 UTC,How much do taxes in NY factor in?  With a cap on salary of UDFA - the states without income tax have a huge advantage...so Miami has a leg up on us...
nyjets,34scpb,mnmnstrd,3,Mon May 4 14:21:47 2015 UTC,"Teams in states with no personal income tax:   Houston Texans Dallas Cowboys Miami Dolphins Tampa Bay Buccaneers Jacksonville Jaguars Seattle Seahawks  Tennessee Titans   Players pay personal income tax in the states that they play in - a player on any of the above teams would not pay income tax when playing in their home stadium. You would pay income tax in the state where you play away games unless it's in FL/TX/TN/WA. Yes, there is money to be saved by playing in a tax free state, but I believe a UDFA's contract is capped at $435K, so it wouldn't make a huge difference when you are only saving in half of the games. Might make a bigger deal if you're getting a Suh-type contract, where you could make millions extra by playing in a tax free state."
nyjets,34scpb,MustacheDanger,2,Mon May 4 15:50:46 2015 UTC,To be pedantic: They don't pay state income tax. They would still pay federal income tax.
nyjets,34scpb,matap821,0,Mon May 4 17:11:45 2015 UTC,We should probably get him just so he doesn't land in the Pats or Dolphins.
nyjets,34scpb,HaruSoul,0,Mon May 4 04:13:53 2015 UTC,Offer him the max amount of money possible. You're getting a first round talent for the price of a 2nd rounder without actually having to use a draft pick.

nyjets,34rwjg,_vsrs_,1 point,Mon May 4 01:57:30 2015 UTC,Id take the assets. Possibly trade up next year and grab a franchise qb.
nyjets,34rwjg,MustacheDanger,12,Mon May 4 17:16:03 2015 UTC,I'd give up Mo and a 2nd rounder for Rivers. Or something like that.  Really I'd give up anything to get a star qb.
nyjets,34rwjg,yum13,2,Mon May 4 06:58:28 2015 UTC,Honestly I'd probably trade him for Rivers straight up. I would need extra picks if we were trading for Cutler though
nyjets,34rwjg,ForeignAlphabet,4,Mon May 4 12:47:11 2015 UTC,Screw cutler I'd rather have Geno start the whole year. Realistically rivers or Brees should be our only 2 targets
nyjets,34rwjg,anon5848,18,Mon May 4 18:38:37 2015 UTC,A franchise qb even late in his years  it would settle all the question this team has and make us super bowl contenders

nyjets,34rwjg,FromAshyToClassy,5,Mon May 4 09:25:34 2015 UTC,"People calling for multiple first round picks, that's a bit insane if you ask me.   He's on the last year of his contract, and he's due ~80% of JJ Watt's contract. It's gonna be a lot of money to spend on him.   If he's going to be traded, I would like to get a first round pick for him, but I don't think we'd be getting much more, when who we trade to is likely going to get 1 year out of Wilkerson."
nyjets,34rwjg,h0wdy,9,Mon May 4 01:40:33 2015 UTC,We could trade him to Tampa for a 1st and then sign him back the next year ;)

nyjets,34rwjg,FromAshyToClassy,1 point,Mon May 4 07:49:05 2015 UTC,We got 1 for revis. And a conditional 4th I think that we didn't get anyway.   I could see the price being about the same for Mo
nyjets,34rwjg,Nadtastic,4,Mon May 4 13:40:26 2015 UTC,Pretty sure we got the 4th.  It would have turned into a 3rd but they cut him before that deadline.

nyjets,34rwjg,donat28,4,Mon May 4 16:30:09 2015 UTC,probably higher as he doesn't have the injury that Revis did
nyjets,34rwjg,woodchips24,2,Mon May 4 14:58:03 2015 UTC,We got that 4th. But then spent it on Jalen Saunders. So its like we never had it anyway

nyjets,34rwjg,CosmicWy,1 point,Mon May 4 02:51:42 2015 UTC,"id like to get at least a second 1st and 3rd for next year, we're gonna need ammunition to trade up for a QB. There'll be room to extend him, so I don't think a trade is a must. But, considering that 4 DLs of this caliber would be a luxury for us, our huge need at QB and the available QBs in next year's draft, the ideal situation would be to move him."
nyjets,34rwjg,Seven_Li0ns,-6,Mon May 4 04:19:14 2015 UTC,At the least we should be getting 2 first rounders or a big time QB. I'm thinking either Drew Brees or Phillip Rivers plus a 1st and other picks
nyjets,34rwjg,awolf97,8,Mon May 4 01:07:53 2015 UTC,"There's no way Mo gets back an elite QB and picks, it'd be a straight one for one deal. Actually, we'd probably have to throw in a pick."
nyjets,34rwjg,SolomonGunnEsq,2,Mon May 4 01:37:39 2015 UTC,This is a crazy statement!  There are upwards of 25-30 GOOD defensive linemen in the league.  Wilkerson is probably the 3rd best (let's say for arguments sake).  There are only 32 starting QBs in the league and 15 of them are meh.  You're not reeling in a starting QB PLUS extra picks.  Dealing a QB equals trading from a position of strength.  We would be trading from a position where there are CONSTANTLY good defensive linemen in every draft and we want a QB for a great lineman who has one year left on his contract and the dude wants Suh money.  This is crazy.  we're going to be lucky to get a 2nd for him.  Any team can just wait for him to walk and get him for nothing (similar to Rivers after this season).
nyjets,34rwjg,awolf97,-6,Mon May 4 13:21:38 2015 UTC,Straight up swap:  Mo for AP
nyjets,34rwjg,SolomonGunnEsq,-7,Mon May 4 04:37:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think you could get a first. Great player, but Jets are in a tough spot w/ him here. Very little leverage."
nyjets,34rwjg,awolf97,6,Mon May 4 03:36:49 2015 UTC,I'd argue that the Jets have all the leverage. He's playing this year for $7m and can be franchised next year for $12m. It's in his benefit to sign an extension now even if it means a little less money in free agency in two seasons.
nyjets,34rwjg,games456,-1,Mon May 4 03:39:34 2015 UTC,"Where are you getting that 12m number? I've seen two people cite it now but I don't think it's the right figure.    It's in his benefit to sign an extension now even if it means a little less money in free agency in two seasons.   Again, not sure the 12m is correct. 7m would be the # this year even if he signed an extension."
nyjets,34rwjg,games456,1 point,Mon May 4 03:45:25 2015 UTC,It's the projected DT number
nyjets,34rwjg,donat28,1 point,Mon May 4 15:24:39 2015 UTC,Why would he get the DT tag? Seems like he has a pretty rock solid case to get DE money.
nyjets,34rwjg,games456,1 point,Mon May 4 20:57:29 2015 UTC,"You are correct, it will be 14-15 million for a DE. We are not in a strong negotiation position but it seems that many Jets fans are wearing rose colored glasses when it comes to this issue.  With that said I hope he kills Tom Brandy before he leaves."
nyjets,34rwjg,donat28,0,Mon May 4 14:02:01 2015 UTC,"The JETS hold all the leverage, have all the cards, have replacement and options for MO - and this halfwit thinks it's not a good negotiating position.   He is getting top dollar no matter what happens. Wilkerson will start getting 15 million dollars starting next year no matter what the Jets do, which is why the Jets are not in a strong negotiating position. He does not need them to get paid."
nyjets,34rwjg,games456,-2,Mon May 4 14:20:29 2015 UTC,"He is getting top dollar no matter what happens.    you don't know what he will decide, tool, and you miss the point of negotiation.  Mo is worth what Mo is worth.  But the JETS are in a position of STRENGTH as they have a strong D-Line and they have OPTIONS.  They don't need Wilk as much as he needs them.  Will he get his 15m?  Sure - but a long term contract provides security that a franchise tag doesn't.  But you are a moron incapable of rational thought and you seem to think (I use that word loosely) that you know what Wilkerson will do in the future."
nyjets,34rwjg,games456,0,Mon May 4 14:32:21 2015 UTC,"Will he get his 15m? Sure - but a long term contract provides security that a franchise tag doesn't   You just said it stupid. If he does not like the contract he just takes the franchise tag, gets paid 15 million loses no money and then he leaves and gets paid big money somewhere else.   It is completely logical and unlike you him and his agents are not morons. If he was willing to take a cheap contract just to stay here like you hoped it would have gotten done by now.   But keep hanging on to your silly little thought that he will stay for cheap because it is what you want him to do, the thought is as childish as you are."

nyjets,34s1x2,CatfishHugo,2,Mon May 4 14:16:53 2015 UTC,He does average just above that. But that's because there are plays where a QB gets all day to throw.

nyjets,34vb19,ThreeCranes,3,Mon May 4 21:40:09 2015 UTC,"You are overestimating the trade value of Geno and Stacy. Brees Also has a huge contract with big cap hits, and he is old. Trading our best player and our next 2 1st round picks will cripple us for the future. Terrible trade."
nyjets,34vb19,Dacious96,2,Mon May 4 22:07:26 2015 UTC,No way you give up that much for a QB who has maybe 2 or 3 good years left.
nyjets,34vb19,McStrauss,1 point,Mon May 4 21:57:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe not, but I don't think its that easy to say don't give up the farm for 2 or 3 years.   Would you rather have an elite QB for 2 or 3 years and be a superbowl contender (or even favorite), or have a mediocre QB for 5+ years and fight for the wildcard every year.  Granted, the scenario OP laid out, does seem a bit excessive but I wouldn't be opposed to giving up a lot for Brees"
nyjets,34vb19,dagcity,1 point,Mon May 4 22:09:05 2015 UTC,Neither. Going into a win now mentality and selling the farm purely to be a contender for 2-3 years is a bad idea. It doesn't guarantee a Super Bowl win by any means. You're much better off trying to develop a young quarterback to give you a 10+ year window to win. I'd much rather be a wildcard team for 10 straight years than get homefield advantage for 3.

nyjets,34o9gg,Capon3,22,Sun May 3 00:14:14 2015 UTC,This is the same fan base that has been crying for Matt Simms the last couple years... So I doubt it
nyjets,34o9gg,armylax20,14,Sun May 3 01:05:33 2015 UTC,"Was anyone not calling for Simms after Geno got benched in the worst first quarter any QB has ever had in history and then Vick sucked for the next game or two? I know Simms is most likely never going to be a starter, but there was literally no downside to giving him some playing time in that part of our season"
nyjets,34o9gg,ForeignAlphabet,6,Sun May 3 01:58:28 2015 UTC,"Yea I know, but Simms wasn't a wet behind the ears rook."
nyjets,34o9gg,jay1024,1 point,Sun May 3 01:23:46 2015 UTC,when does Matt Simms get his shot ? i think he has proved him self more than enough times.
nyjets,34o9gg,mikerhoa,1 point,Tue May 5 05:45:50 2015 UTC,So you're suggesting that the entire fan base has been calling for Sims?  I've been present for every game thread and discussion during the season and I can tell you that it's only a negligible minority who constantly stump for Simms.   Unless you can provide evidence otherwise...
nyjets,34o9gg,armylax20,2,Sun May 3 03:29:38 2015 UTC,"No, I didn't say that at all. Just saying you sure as shit will see people calling for him in this sub if Geno/Fitz have a few bad games. If the jets are 3-6 those same people are going to say to give him a shot there is nothing to lose. Hell, that ESPN douche O'Conner wrote an article today titled ""Petty has to be great."" It's already begun."
nyjets,34o9gg,mikerhoa,2,Sun May 3 03:55:26 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  But cut me some slack, I was just going by what you wrote:   This is the same fan base that has been crying for Matt Simms the last couple years   I understand that immediately calling for the rookie is an impulsive ""grass is greener"" thing to do, and the media will sow discord by fueling it, but I think we also need to remember that we've stuck with shitty QB's and it's really hurt us. Everyone from Todd to O'Donnell to Sanchez (especially Sanchez) to Smith was given a fair shot from the organization and it led us to not much more than mediocrity while other teams found their guy and flourished.  We're pretty patient all things considered. If we were as bad as some people say Geno wouldn't even be in the conversation. Yet here he is, still in the mix. And look at teams like Philly, Cleveland, Buffalo, TB, Houston, and a few others. They go through QB's like crackheads through go through stems. We're saint-like by comparison.  I understand what you're saying though..."
nyjets,34o9gg,tejmin,1 point,Sun May 3 04:13:06 2015 UTC,"It's like this is the only pick we've made.   Not the best player in the whole entire draft, not a nice deep threat WR, not a nice OLB, but this QB who only played in spread offenses and never made a checkdown by himself is the BEST PLAYER WE DRAFTED! HOLY FUCK IS THE NAMATH COMETH AGAINETH?!"
nyjets,34o9gg,armylax20,1 point,Sun May 3 16:34:44 2015 UTC,"And another responder to my comment was the one to suggest EVERYONE was calling for Simms, not me"
nyjets,34o9gg,JYB16,44,Sun May 3 03:57:11 2015 UTC,"This should be the highest post on the sub. Petty has the tools to be good starter a couple years down the road, but we have to be patient. Within 2-3 years of sitting we should see the qb the jets have been waiting for. A lot of people forget this was supposed to be genos role until Sanchez got injured by Rex's move to keep him in that preseason game. Geno still can be good but we know we have had problems with young qbs when rushed onto the field.     Edit: spelling"
nyjets,34o9gg,JYB16,4,Sun May 3 00:34:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Who knows what Geno would've been this year if he sat the last 2. But now basically anything he does will be scrutinized. Unless he goes out and put's up 3500 25/10 it seems like he can't win anyone over. No matter what he or Fitz does this year tho, we can't start pushing for Petty. It's had to be patient, but with all the losing and bust's at QB, we need to."
nyjets,34o9gg,espi0920,4,Sun May 3 00:37:59 2015 UTC,I honestly believe based on mike maccagnan's offseason so far. His philosophies on the draft and free agency is going to be a good recipe of the sustainable success john idzik was preaching.
nyjets,34o9gg,ZeboTheClown,2,Sun May 3 00:48:29 2015 UTC,Yea totally agree. I finally feel like the Jets are in good hands.
nyjets,34o9gg,staiano,1 point,Sun May 3 00:58:33 2015 UTC,"I think sitting him and letting him learn the system would do wonders. Too many people want rookies to be Day 1 starters, and that rarely seemed to work out well."

nyjets,34nrl5,racismisgay,6,Sat May 2 21:41:17 2015 UTC,We picked up too much offensive talent for Rex.
nyjets,34nrl5,anon5848,12,Sun May 3 01:19:21 2015 UTC,"I don't see any risk. Better than any RB still available, rookie contract."

nyjets,34nrl5,nickmangoldsbeard,2,Sat May 2 21:33:06 2015 UTC,"Yup, although a lot of the same type of runner just got to hope one of them breaks out and makes the choice easy for the coaches."

nyjets,34nrl5,soupx360a,6,Sat May 2 21:21:45 2015 UTC,Dude is much better than what you saw last season. This could be turn out to be a steal if he gets the volume he needs.
nyjets,34nrl5,JeezusChristIII,4,Sat May 2 21:35:03 2015 UTC,"Really? Because most people I've seen say he was a product of volume , aka not very good"
nyjets,34nrl5,soupx360a,-1,Sat May 2 22:22:22 2015 UTC,"People say he is a workhorse back who needs a few carries to get going. He is a very solid back, but would be best suited as a #1. If rumors are true that the new front office doesn't really like Ivory, then I can see a Stacy/Ridley combo, with Powell on 3rd downs. BUT, all we gave up was a 7th, so it doesn't mean Mac is in love with Stacy...he's just in love of making smart moves and this was definitely that."
nyjets,34nrl5,QuestionYourBeliefs,6,Sat May 2 22:36:55 2015 UTC,There are rumors that they don't like ivory ???
nyjets,34nrl5,Vukomanovich,8,Sat May 2 23:37:46 2015 UTC,Yeah this is the first I'm hearing of this. Is it just generated by the people who seem to think if we draft any position then we don't like our current personnel?
nyjets,34nrl5,Stalfo14,5,Sun May 3 00:02:20 2015 UTC,That's one hell of a trade. a 5th rounder for Marshal and Stacy. Congrats Jets fans!
nyjets,34nrl5,daprodigyx19,9,Sat May 2 22:40:29 2015 UTC,For a 7th rounder? I'll take that all day.

nyjets,34nrl5,openingceremony,3,Sat May 2 21:26:57 2015 UTC,Talented RB. We've got quite a stable of bruisers now. Lots of options on offense all around. That's a nice change.

nyjets,34nrl5,sameolejets,1 point,Sun May 3 02:18:21 2015 UTC,"Okay. That still doesn't sell me on this guy though. My bigger gripe is that he's a very similar style of back to Ivory, Powell, and Ridley. I was hoping for a speed complement, not another downhill runner."
nyjets,34nrl5,dumbego,1 point,Sun May 3 03:10:25 2015 UTC,"How well do you know Stacy?  Powell, right now, is the most valuable RB on the Jets, because he's known to catch passes.  As far as I know, both Ridley & Ivory are substandard for that.  Which leaves Stacy:  is he known for catching passes & YAC?"
nyjets,34nrl5,sameolejets,1 point,Sun May 3 10:18:28 2015 UTC,"You know, I was right there with you. I thought that if he had been a pass catching back, then it would really be a coup. But, looking at his stats, it doesn't really look like he is. In two years he had 58 targets, 44 receptions for 293 yards."
nyjets,34nrl5,Mikelele15,1 point,Sun May 3 13:28:48 2015 UTC,"Stacy wanted out of the Rams, because he was riding the bench BEFORE they drafted their new RB.  Stacy is still better than a 7th round pick, and Stacy just wants a chance to start on another team.  So now we have three Ridleys that don't fit on a spread offense & Powell."
nyjets,34nrl5,openingceremony,1 point,Sun May 3 23:43:47 2015 UTC,Great pickup! Really happy with this trade! GO Jets!
nyjets,34nrl5,viewless25,1 point,Sat May 2 21:23:34 2015 UTC,Who is the odd man out? No one rolls 4 deep at RB.
nyjets,34nrl5,Shadune,2,Sat May 2 21:28:46 2015 UTC,Gotta be Richardson and possibly Powell
nyjets,34nrl5,ZeboTheClown,6,Sat May 2 21:29:24 2015 UTC,"I think Powell is the only complete back in the group. Ivory, Ridley and Stacy all bring the same thing to the table. One of those three won't make it to the season opener."
nyjets,34nrl5,mastodon6,7,Sat May 2 21:33:24 2015 UTC,I'm not married to any of them but if its Ridley I'll feel kind of bad for his tattoo.

nyjets,34nrl5,NYJETSfaninNE,1 point,Sun May 3 05:37:28 2015 UTC,So far stacy has shown some ability on the passing game.
nyjets,34nrl5,sameolejets,2,Sat May 2 22:18:27 2015 UTC,I think we will roll 4 deep.  Ivory and Ridley are the same type of back.  Stacey and Powell are another style of back.  Gotta have options in case of injury.  Plus if we drop FB from the roster we can easily carry the 4.
nyjets,34nrl5,Deigs,4,Sat May 2 21:50:48 2015 UTC,Dropping the FB is an intriguing option... I don't think Chan uses FBs in his spread system
nyjets,34nrl5,elephantbuddy,1 point,Sat May 2 21:56:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, poor Connor.  No spread system uses an FB.  In the unlikely instance the spread needs a mobile blocker, they use a backup OL, a ""blocking"" TE, or a FB which is only used as a ""blocking"" TE."
nyjets,34nrl5,Clyde10,2,Sun May 3 10:14:09 2015 UTC,"Powell is our receiving back, Stacy is just like Ivory and Ridley."
nyjets,34nrl5,Impsalterego,1 point,Sat May 2 22:04:18 2015 UTC,"I'd keep all four.  Powell has a unique skillset compared to the rest of them, and I still have concerns over Ivory's and Ridley's durability.  However, if Stacy shows up more than Ridley in training camp/preseason, Ridley might get cut."

nyjets,34p0g6,Redd-It-Here,8,Sun May 3 12:03:47 2015 UTC,When I read a Mehta article all I see is Garbage Garbage Garbage. I should go get my eyes checked.
nyjets,34p0g6,Capon3,6,Sun May 3 08:55:01 2015 UTC,"For all you saying he's right. Yes and no. Bowles used a lot of 3-4, 4-3, 5-2 sets last year. It's def possible to use all these guys. But that means many won't play as often as they would on a different team or situation. It's honestly going to be up to the player if they are okay with that. And when it comes to Wilks contract. There are some athletes that are loyal enough to their team to take less money. They are becoming rare but they exist. I know there's a big difference between 10 and 15 million but are you serious, guy? You're a millionaire either way. For playing football."
nyjets,34p0g6,John_YJKR,3,Sun May 3 08:07:21 2015 UTC,"It's not about the yearly amount for many players. They want the guaranteed money. Some would be willing to take less per year if it meant more in guarantees.  I don't think Mo will be going anywhere. Harrison would be the odd man out here anyway, not Mo."
nyjets,34p0g6,Zerd85,2,Sun May 3 15:32:08 2015 UTC,"While I agree with the 10-15, Wilkerson is still on his rookie contract I believe."
nyjets,34p0g6,tlk742,1 point,Sun May 3 15:03:57 2015 UTC,Yep and can be tagged next year for a good value for his talent.
nyjets,34p0g6,Zerd85,1 point,Sun May 3 15:32:56 2015 UTC,Yeah but folks on the rookie contract rarely take a discount first contract out.
nyjets,34p0g6,tlk742,5,Sun May 3 15:57:01 2015 UTC,"For an average 3 year career.  Most players have to accept that NFL football is a sideshow in their life, and will have to have a ""real"" career lined up after they can't play football.  While also dealing with chronic physical ailments, if not early onset dementia.  To the viewers, playing football is a game.  To the guys on the field, its going through brutal, potentially crippling, physical abuse, hopefully for something they love doing, but make no mistake, it comes with a payday that needs to last the rest of their lives.  I don't grudge them a penny, but sometimes I ask myself if I should stop following the game, on moral principle."
nyjets,34p0g6,sameolejets,2,Sun May 3 11:52:27 2015 UTC,Those numbers are very skewed by unknown players. 1st rounders have much longer careers.
nyjets,34p0g6,John_YJKR,1 point,Sun May 3 18:38:09 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere if you only include guys who make a 53 man roster, the average career is closer to 6 years."
nyjets,34p0g6,woodchips24,1 point,Sun May 3 22:31:17 2015 UTC,"I didn't read Mehta's article (never do) but I think the problem won't be in finding the position to play them together, but fitting all of them under the cap."

nyjets,34p0g6,Plastic_Mouldsman,14,Sun May 3 07:47:47 2015 UTC,"He's not right. We had several million in dead money this season. We have two contract extensions we can give Wilkerson (an option and a franchise tag) before giving him the JJ Watt contract. At that point, Mangold and D'Bricks contracts are up, freeing up around 20 million per season.  Its tight. But its doable if they want to do it."
nyjets,34p0g6,otomotopia,3,Sun May 3 13:41:11 2015 UTC,Cool. Thanks for clarifying.
nyjets,34p0g6,Plastic_Mouldsman,1 point,Sun May 3 19:52:53 2015 UTC,"Well, its what he does best, so I can't imagine him going away from this.   Get Mo to sign an extension (or franchise tag him, like they will if things go south), then line up Williams with Mo and Sheldon, and BOOM. QB's beware. Harrison is the man out on that, but chances are in the first year Williams and Harrison will switch. Then by next season they'll either let Harrison go, or maybe try and trade him.   Not all is wrong in the Jets universe, but you wouldn't know that if Mehta is your only source of info. The dude is paid to paint this picture of chaos and shit, but that isn't the case. I really wonder if the Jets can take away his credentials or something. Tell the DN to send someone who doesn't suck."
nyjets,34p0g6,rvbcaboose1018,1 point,Sun May 3 18:47:41 2015 UTC,"I don't see the Jets successfully trading him. He's going to be a bit pricey and cheap run stuffing NT's aren't exactly impossible to find. Snacks is good, but shouldn't be overestimated..."
nyjets,34p0g6,rvbcaboose1018,1 point,Sun May 3 20:43:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at the same time though, who exactly do you trade then? Mo will get the franchise tag, Snacks will probably stay for a lesser amount, Sheldon is like 2 years away from talking about contracts, and Williams will be on his rookie contract. So who?   Mehta is talking out of his ass with the Wilkerson trade talk. Its all speculation unless a team actually wants to give us 2 first rounders, but the spirit of that move was to say ""we're not shopping him, stop calling unless you want to sell your future for him""   Honestly though, the way this sub has reacted to all the talk, its just...its easy to see where he gets this from when half of this sub was bouncing off the wall just thinking about it."
nyjets,34p0g6,OneManArmy77,-7,Sun May 3 22:16:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but hes right. Yall are in the honeymoon stage where you think that we can make it work with all of our D-line talent, but its just not going to happen. Thats exactly what ive been saying since we drafted Williams."
nyjets,34p0g6,Capon3,10,Sun May 3 07:40:01 2015 UTC,"Why can't it work? Cause I watched every game with Mo and Sheldon, I saw them both line up as DE, and DT and perform at ProBowl quality at both. Add in Williams who has already stated he doesn't mind either. How is this a problem? Honestly this looks like the best line you could ask for! 3 really versatile guys on your D-Line that can play as inside or outside linemen."
nyjets,34p0g6,Superjam83,0,Sun May 3 08:53:36 2015 UTC,Because $$$
nyjets,34p0g6,B_H_Dweller,5,Sun May 3 10:38:07 2015 UTC,They have the space to pay Mo in 2016
nyjets,34p0g6,Superjam83,1 point,Sun May 3 12:03:49 2015 UTC,"What about Harrison? There's other players. It's very possible the Mo stays but with what Suh and Watt have gotten, the market for Mo will be quite lucrative. My prediction: he gets franchised in 2016 as the Jets entertain possible suitors."
nyjets,34p0g6,B_H_Dweller,3,Sun May 3 12:51:38 2015 UTC,"Yea I think you have to exhaust the trade market before letting him walk, and franchise tag would buy more time. But you could also sign him long term."
nyjets,34p0g6,Superjam83,0,Sun May 3 13:29:44 2015 UTC,"The issue with a long term deal is he'd end up going up to at least 14m+ a year which, a year or 2 later would go for Sheldon too."
nyjets,34p0g6,STNbrossy,1 point,Sun May 3 13:31:15 2015 UTC,We can afford paying 2 of them at a time good money. When Williams needs to get paid Wilkerson will be on the wrong side of 30.
nyjets,34p0g6,danomite555,1 point,Sun May 3 19:10:20 2015 UTC,Harrison is likely gone in 2016 along with Breno and possibly Cro. Ferguson and Coples are probably gone in 2017. I'd rather retain Wilkerson over all of those players. We do need to invest heavily in the o-line going forward though.
nyjets,34p0g6,woodchips24,1 point,Sun May 3 17:57:43 2015 UTC,"I think Ferguson will stay, although at a cheaper contract. I don't think theres any team out there that will pay 9 million a year for a 33 year old LT"
nyjets,34p0g6,maxwellpowers,3,Sun May 3 22:35:25 2015 UTC,"Well shit. If you only you worked for the jets front office, then you could have told them not to bother drafting Williams."
nyjets,34p0g6,B_H_Dweller,2,Sun May 3 12:56:24 2015 UTC,"I think it can work. D lines are rotations, and we'd have the best in the league.   Who would you trade Mo for anyway? The only position that makes sense would be QB, and I don't see that happening."
nyjets,34p0g6,kenbrellfan,-3,Sun May 3 12:05:08 2015 UTC,Here's the reality of the situation (in my opinion):  We don't have the personnel to main a 4-3. We have 3-4 DEs and 4-3 DTs. None of these 4 guys can play 4-3 DE. The other issue is that they're all too talented to be rotational guys. I can only see this ending one way. Wilkerson goes.
nyjets,34p0g6,elephantbuddy,3,Sun May 3 09:05:58 2015 UTC,Harrison actually was a rotational player last year and will probably play even less this year.
nyjets,34p0g6,woodchips24,1 point,Sun May 3 14:54:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he played the lion's share and was the starter. I think spelling him with Williams can work, but NT isn't exactly the position that will get all those open lanes to the QB.  Bowles has a problem, but as Marlo Stanfield said: ""It's one of those good problems..."""
nyjets,34p0g6,jetsfan07,1 point,Sun May 3 15:00:54 2015 UTC,"An NTs job is take up 2 blockers, which opens lanes for the LBs behind him. Snacks doesn't show up on the stat sheet a lot, but he does the dirty work so others can. He's very important."
nyjets,34p0g6,TreSeven,1 point,Sun May 3 22:38:14 2015 UTC,id hardly call 33% a lion's share. Harrison is seriously overhyped by this fan base
nyjets,34p0g6,elephantbuddy,2,Sun May 3 15:43:50 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say he's overhyped, he's a damn good player. I think we just think he makes much more of an impact than he actually does because we generally don't realize how little he actually plays."
nyjets,34p0g6,danomite555,1 point,Sun May 3 16:29:58 2015 UTC,"Do you have sources for this?  Because I'm finding it very hard to believe Ellis, Douzable, Barnes, or whoever else took more snaps than he did.  I mean you could be right, but that stat seems very unlikely to me.

nyjets,34p0g6,woodchips24,2,Sun May 3 17:16:14 2015 UTC,I don't know where he got 33% from.  Harrison had the third most snaps out of our defensive linemen last year at 48%.  Richardson had 80%; Wilkerson had 70% and Douzable had 31%.  Ellis and Barnes combined for less than 25%.    Source: http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/snapcounts

nyjets,34o73y,CoMaBlaCK,8,Sun May 3 00:58:05 2015 UTC,I like that he talks to the media like they're children.    The New York media are essentially children so it's a wise strategy.

nyjets,34o73y,cc2015,4,Sun May 3 00:19:57 2015 UTC,I'm extremely impressed so far. His ability to not be Idzik has really blown me away.
nyjets,34o73y,SpygateHernandez,8,Sun May 3 13:34:35 2015 UTC,"Somewhat excited but also wary, to be honest he's given me some flashes of Tannenbaum so far.   People forget that Tannenbaum's first few drafts were fantastic and he knocked them out of the park with very aggressive moves that resulted in guys who've been the stars of our team for the past 7-8 years (Mangold, Revis, Brick). However his downfall was the big contracts he gave out and how he let the cap go to shit.   I'm willing to give Mac the benefit of the doubt so far but he gave out some big contracts to some questionable free agents. A lot of fans hated Idzik for hoarding cap space and now love Mac for making moves but this could hurt us in the long run. The operative word being could, it's impossible to judge this so early but I'm not happy that we gave big contracts to 3 cornerbacks at the same time.   Personally I'm warily optimistic, and I think people are overlooking the downsides of his approach thus far out of their excitement."
nyjets,34o73y,Somenakedguy,9,Sun May 3 01:03:40 2015 UTC,"I think the big difference is that Mac's deals, with the exception of Revis, have no long term guarantees tied to the player. Almost all of them can be cut after one year with little to no money owed."
nyjets,34o73y,lilphil240,2,Sun May 3 01:24:30 2015 UTC,"Was just about to say this. The deals might seem like large money, and some of them are, most of that money seems to be front-loaded, so they shouldn't be issues that will keep us tied down to players down the road.  That said, I think it's fair to be cautiously optimistic."
nyjets,34o73y,BigNuke43,2,Sun May 3 03:47:34 2015 UTC,Keep in mind many of the FA we did sign can be cut after 1-2 years with virtually 0 dead money.  I feel confident in saying Macdaddy is the GM weve been waiting for. BPA and made moves to fill needs. He knows what he's doing. He gets the players and lets Bowels do his job.  You literally can't get better than that as a GM.
nyjets,34o73y,Zerd85,1 point,Sun May 3 02:36:04 2015 UTC,That's true. While I think he's done a good job he vastly overpaid buster skrine. 4 years 25 mil with 13 mil guaranteed for a slot corner who is practically a walking penalty? Other than that I think he's done very well
nyjets,34o73y,shewantstheMcB,2,Sun May 3 03:50:46 2015 UTC,"Our FA was amazing, and Mac is dealing with the media really well. We need to wait and see how these new draftees actually play in the NFL, nobody drafts at 100%, but I think we did a great job drafting the BPA, and drafting guys that will fit in with the locker room culture we want.  This season can't start soon enough."
nyjets,34o73y,SpoonThief,2,Sun May 3 00:44:11 2015 UTC,"Based on his moves in FA, what he's given up to get what we have now, gives me a solid half chub.  Now, if I'm going to be harder than a diamond, I need to see how his draft picks perform, which could take several seasons."
nyjets,34o73y,thewrightstuff88,2,Sun May 3 01:18:32 2015 UTC,"I like Mac a lot so far, I just hope he learns to talk a little less. If you watch the day 2 press conference, he talked about draft philosophy and strategies with the press for what must have been 20 minutes.  Funny how you called him the professor because if you watch it he is practically giving a how you draft 101 class. He seems like he really wants to share, but I wish he would be a little more tight lipped.  I love Bowles, he looks like he wants to get the hell out of there as quick as he can without saying anything."
nyjets,34o73y,games456,10,Sun May 3 00:35:59 2015 UTC,"What Mac says is basically common knowledge to all or at least most GMs. It's not like he's sharing his deepest drafting secrets, just giving a little insight on the process for those who don't experience it themselves."
nyjets,34o73y,Deigs,-5,Sun May 3 01:05:14 2015 UTC,Did you watch it?
nyjets,34o73y,games456,5,Sun May 3 01:08:47 2015 UTC,I watched it and I enjoyed what he talked about. I don't think he gave away much because someone asked him what they were looking for in today's day of drafting in the press conference last night. Someone asked what positions he was looking for and he politely declined to answer and then told the reporter why he was declining to comment. He said he didn't want to give away any secrets.
nyjets,34o73y,games456,-7,Sun May 3 02:01:55 2015 UTC,"Well I will tell you I learned a lot of his draft philosophy that I did not know, so I would assume that others did as well. he said that later rounds he will pretty said he does not just up or down BPA and that he goes more for need. Which is different than some teams do.   The comment that he declined if I remember correctly was pretty much asking if he still had QB's he was interested in. Of course he is not going to answer."
nyjets,34o73y,XiiencE,1 point,Sun May 3 03:57:48 2015 UTC,To another GM as far as they know he could be throwing smokescreens. He's clearly a smart guy. I would trust that he isn't giving any information that is not common knowledge.
nyjets,34o73y,games456,1 point,Tue May 5 20:05:06 2015 UTC,This has nothing to do with a smokescreens. He was explaining his philosophy and decision making and his reasoning on things. These are things that teams eventually find out after you have a few drafts under your belt and some people from the organization start talking. I just figure don't tell people more than you have to.
nyjets,34o73y,BigNuke43,5,Tue May 5 23:23:26 2015 UTC,"Umm, did you? He's not loose-lipped at all with what would be important information. He's routinely state ""I won't answer that question as it would give insight to other teams about our strategy and planning"" when he's asked a question that shouldn't be answered. Unless you think talking about BPA is somehow a super secret philosophy that only the Jets and Mac know about, I don't get this idea that he's loose with secrets. Being precise and giving thought out answers to random questions isn't going to reveal anything."
nyjets,34o73y,games456,-9,Sun May 3 03:44:57 2015 UTC,"You can read the comment that I posted above, I learned things about his draft strategy that I did not know so it only makes sense that others did as well."
nyjets,34o73y,BigNuke43,5,Sun May 3 03:58:39 2015 UTC,Answer this: do you really think NFL GMs and FOs can't figure that out for themselves? That they're on the same level as random fans in terms of what they know?
nyjets,34o73y,games456,-15,Sun May 3 04:14:52 2015 UTC,"Answer this. How the hell would GM's know the drafting process and priorities of a first time GM. You act like there is a fucking newsletter or the they all get together and talk about it. It took years before people knew what BB's strategies and thoughts were in the draft and that only happened after people who were in the organization spoke. According to your logic everyone should have known right? And how people like the Steelers do not even consider other peoples draft picks and they flat out draft their board. People do it differently and I do not see any reason letting anyone know you thoughts or reasoning.  This idea that because GM's and coaches are pro's that they are somehow psychic and know everything about everyone is probably one of the dumbest assumptions people make. Also all I said was that I would like it if he talked about it a little less, you are acting like I said he showed people our draft board for fucks sake"
nyjets,34o73y,BigNuke43,3,Sun May 3 04:40:57 2015 UTC,"You're acting as though he said something that no GM or FO could possibly understand, or that it'd surprise them. The only one it seems to be surprising is YOU."
nyjets,34o73y,games456,-9,Sun May 3 07:24:36 2015 UTC,"Wtf are you talking about. Different GMs draft completely differently and have different ways they prioritize, look at the draft and theirs boards. If you don't talk to anyone about it the only way people know is when people inside the organization say something or after years of seeing them draft.  This argument that GM's know how other first time GM's with no history think is fucking stupid. You want proof? Everyone had no idea what the hell Chip Kelly was going to do in the draft, Why?  Because he does not have a history. But YOU are right and everyone else is stupid right? Also all I said is that I wish he talked about it a little less so you and the other idiots can get of you stupid, uninformed horse :)  Also stop putting words in my mouth, I never said it surprised me, there are many ways of doing things and he told me some of his, that was the whole point.."

If Geno/Fitz doesn't work out in 2015, we could burn a middle pick on a higher rated rookie QB with a more competitive selection in a future draft.  As much as I like MacCagnan, I can't shake the notion we could have gotten another OG/OT to provide heat in training camp.  Even if we fill the RG with a rookie, its quite likely we could find better OL backups."

nyjets,34mtv7,darkknight915,1 point,Sat May 2 16:24:56 2015 UTC,"Hundley is exactly like Geno Smith it would have been a pointless pick. Petty is more of a traditional QB, strong arm, good pocket presence just hasn't been under center much."

While he hasn't spent a ton of time under center and he ran a spread with quick releases in college, he has a lot of talent and is smart. He's got a big arm, decent foot work, he's fairly athletic (think extend the play not run the read option) has shown he can make good reads, and seems to have ice in his veins while at Baylor.   He's got upside he's just not a day one starter, give him a or two and he could be a top 16 quarterback."
nyjets,34mtv7,MasterCheftain,4,Sun May 3 04:11:43 2015 UTC,"A lot of our core players are old (Mangold, Brick, Marshall, Revis, Cro) so our team is in a win-now mode IMO. Petty will likely not make an impact within the next few years, and an O-Line addition would help our team next season a lot more than drafting Petty would be. I'd feel more comfortable next season rolling with Geno and Fitz with a stronger O-Line than drafting Petty."

He didn't run a read progression in college at baylor, but sitting behind a smart guy like Fitzpatrick could be very beneficial. Really like this guy and I'm stoked we drafted him. Could be good in the future."
nyjets,34mtv7,tps222,4,Sat May 2 16:27:54 2015 UTC,All the available QBs in this draft are a crap shoot. I'm glad the Jets didn't use a higher pick to roll the dice with.
nyjets,34mtv7,likewhatalready,1 point,Sat May 2 16:34:27 2015 UTC,A 3rd rounder is a pretty high pick.  You're supposed to get a starter with the 3rd round pick.
nyjets,34mtv7,BatmanBatman69,3,Sun May 3 10:42:32 2015 UTC,I like it. Have him sit behind Geno and Fitz this year and if Geno doesn't work out then hopefully he can adjust well to the NFL and be our franchise QB

nyjets,34mtv7,arv98s,5,Sat May 2 16:48:39 2015 UTC,"Loved watching him at Baylor. Led us to our first two conference championships in the Big 12 ... in back to back years. Patiently waited his turn behind RG3 and THEN behind Nick Florence. Really developed on the bench with patience and maturity. Steps in and breaks records and takes Baylor further than we've gone in decades. Some of that is Baylor's offense/system, but Petty has all the tools to succeed in the NFL if he's given a few years to get used to NFL offense."

nyjets,34mtv7,Grimlokh,4,Sat May 2 16:26:39 2015 UTC,"""One-read"" QB is a little misleading. He had multiple reads, they were usually all to one side of the field and ""easier"" reads that you would have with an NFL QB."

nyjets,34mtv7,anon5848,2,Sat May 2 16:52:19 2015 UTC,I'm really happy with the pick. He can learn for a while. He's obviously talented and Fitzjetpack and Geno may or may not be long term solutions.

I can see how this can help this team at this position unless fitz somehow stays here for two or three years and petty becomes ready
nyjets,34mtv7,dragonforcingmywayup,9,Sat May 2 17:05:21 2015 UTC,We have an OC now that runs a spread offense.
nyjets,34mtv7,tgrabowy717,2,Sat May 2 17:26:00 2015 UTC,At this level of draft (103 overall) there are three options to pursue (in the order of priority):   Look for players that can plug the holes. Look for BAP Look for players that aren't ready yet but have potential to be a  future star (a.k.a Aaron Rodgers). Players with high potential but need a year of two years of training before they can make a significant impact.    I think no 3 weighed higher given the crop of players available.
nyjets,34mtv7,GodEmperorBrian,4,Sat May 2 18:46:16 2015 UTC,Kellen Clemens 2.0?

nyjets,34mtv7,viewless25,2,Sat May 2 16:37:45 2015 UTC,Clemens was much more athletic and 2nd rounder
nyjets,34mtv7,tgrabowy717,4,Sat May 2 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"Petty isn't worth this high a pick in my eyes, but he's certainly athletic enough to become a decent starter. No chance of him starting this year certainly   He really needs to work on making better reads and fixing his accuracy problem. You can't even entertain playing him until he's smarter and can hit open throws (which he's had trouble with)"

nyjets,34mtv7,kenbrellfan,1 point,Sat May 2 16:37:50 2015 UTC,"Not a fan. How many times will teams pick QBs who can't go through reads before they realize they will literally never get good at it? Petty's absolute ceiling is probably Andy Dalton. Seriously, name me one QB whose weakness coming out of college was going through reads and improved."
nyjets,34mtv7,gvt87,11,Sat May 2 16:46:05 2015 UTC,Every single QB coming into the NFL?
nyjets,34mtv7,KingMalcolm,2,Sat May 2 16:54:41 2015 UTC,Andy Dalton isn't elite but heis a lot better than Mark or Geno so...
nyjets,34mtv7,CaMelGuY,2,Sat May 2 20:38:29 2015 UTC,"The Jets #1 need both now and in the future is a franchise QB. While Petty is a longshot, they're not going to find that guy if they don't roll the dice. I'm glad they used a medium value pick on this dice roll rather than a 1st or 2nd rounder."
nyjets,34mtv7,grv413,2,Sat May 2 20:40:06 2015 UTC,"I'm sure most scouts woulda told you Brady can't make reads for shit. Even if you play in a pro style offense, the college game doesn't prepare you to make NFL reads. It's something he'll have to learn. He's a smart kid, and he'll sit for a couple years learning the game. He has a big arm, and he's a 4th rounder. If he doesn't pan out, so what? But on the off chance he's the next Rivers/Ryan/Eli caliber QB, we got a fucking steal."
nyjets,34mtv7,domsanti,0,Sat May 2 17:30:46 2015 UTC,"""You're sure"" most scouts would have said that? How can you possibly say that? Brady had the brains for the position; the concern with him was that he had a noodle arm and didn't look like a prototypical QB because he was still flabby. Once he got into an NFL weight training program, his arm strength improved. Brady has never struggled when it comes to making quick, smart decisions. That's literally the one thing that sets him apart. I don't think you can find a recent example of a prospect who struggled to make reads in college and is now good at it. Guys like Kaepernick/Newton/RG3/Geno are basically the same players now that they were the day they got drafted. Kaepernick and RG3 have even taken big steps back."

Missed first two games of 2014 after conditioning concerns following offseason shoulder surgery. In 2014, had starts at both left guard (5 games) and left tackle (2 games). Sat out spring practices due to shoulder injury. Started every game in 2013 and every game in 2012 on offensive line that led the way for Johnny Manziel's Heisman run. As a redshirt freshman, started five games (4 at left guard and 1 at right guard). Played just two years of football in high school while also playing basketball and competing in track and field. Basketball said to be his first love. ANALYSIS      STRENGTHS Burly lower body made for the guard position. High school basketball player who displays rare foot quickness for a man his size. Glides to second level using proper angles. Utilizes power step to shut down inside moves. Has feet and balance to mirror in pass pro pre- and post-contact. Maintains good posture at punch point. Comfortable finding and hitting targets in space. Technically sound in run game and pass pro. Has filled in at tackle and might have swing potential in a pinch. WEAKNESSES Allows more bull-rush push than most guards his size. Will finesse it too often. Hasn't unleashed consistent power that his bend and size should provide him. Shows signs of being a content blocker who won't always finish. Had offseason shoulder surgery. Head coach benched him for first two games due to conditioning concerns. Scouting community has questions about his desire to work hard and manage weight. DRAFT PROJECTION Rounds 3 or 4 SOURCES TELL US ""I believe he has Pro Bowl caliber talent, but his work ethic is a major concern for me. I know he loves basketball, but not sure if he feels the same about football. The talent? That's a given. He's really, really talented."" -- AFC scouting director ""You know what? I actually like the kid. I trust what our scouts have to say about him being lazy but I don't think he's a character concern at all. I'm going to fight for him if he's still there in the fourth round."" -- AFC executive NFL COMPARISON Kelechi Osemele BOTTOM LINE Dancing bear who possesses the talent, technique and physical traits to be a high-end NFL starter. Not asked to fire out on defenders often in Texas A&M scheme, so that might be an area where he has room for growth. Teams might have to decide between the film and the football character when slotting him. Keeping his weight under control could be a tall task during his career."

That's something i'm pretty sure i've seen Aboushi have trouble with. Really interested in this guy. Athletic chart is gorgeous. His 3-cone, Shuttle, broad, vertical, and 40 for a guy who's in the 87th percentile of weight for Guards is incredibly good. That amount of leg power is something to be really excited about.  http://www.mockdraftable.com/player/4717/"
nyjets,34n8l0,brad_smiths_shoe,3,Sat May 2 20:01:06 2015 UTC,needed a guard had the biggest upside of guards left   pretty good pick
nyjets,34n8l0,jetsfan07,2,Sat May 2 19:37:36 2015 UTC,Who's the odd man out at G? Seems that Carpenter/Colon/Aboushi/Dozier/Winters/Harrison is a bit much.
nyjets,34n8l0,MongoJazzy,4,Sat May 2 18:56:44 2015 UTC,Colon and Winters are damn near close to being cut. We'll see if Winters makes strides.
nyjets,34n8l0,SolomonGunnEsq,4,Sat May 2 19:07:46 2015 UTC,Depth at OL is always a very good thing.
nyjets,34ntr2,JawsThemeSwimming37,27,Sat May 2 21:40:21 2015 UTC,"So Maccagnan started his job with 6 picks. Turns them into 8 players, with likely only two (Simon, Harrison) fighting a real uphill battle to stay on the roster. We get 3 WRs, a DE, OLB, QB and RB that have a chance to really contribute.  I'm impressed."
nyjets,34ntr2,jetsfan07,13,Sat May 2 21:44:36 2015 UTC,"And to think...Idzik had 12 last year and didn't move any. Pryor, Amaro, and 7th rounder Trevor Reilly are the only contributers.   Jets haven't taken any snaps in the Bowles of Mac era but I already like the direction they're heading."
nyjets,34ntr2,beanburritobandit,-15,Sat May 2 22:29:14 2015 UTC,Harrison is not fighting an uphill battle. He is one of the top NT in the league. He is one of the major reasons we have such a good run defense.
nyjets,34ntr2,Dacious96,29,Sat May 2 22:03:39 2015 UTC,"Dude.. really.. Jarvis Harrison, lol. We didn't draft Damon Harrison this year."
nyjets,34ntr2,jetsfan07,3,Sat May 2 22:04:39 2015 UTC,Was he our 5th round pick? Sorry I just got out of an exam.
nyjets,34ntr2,Dacious96,8,Sat May 2 22:06:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah lol, says it above:  5th Round: No. 152 overall, via Texans: Jarvis Harrison, G, Texas A&M"
nyjets,34ntr2,jetsfan07,19,Sat May 2 22:07:27 2015 UTC,You forgot to include that we got Posey from the Texans as well in their trade.

nyjets,34ntr2,Superjam83,11,Sun May 3 04:15:59 2015 UTC,I am extremely excited for Devin Smith. Kid with speed and good hands but now he has Karl Dorrel as a position coach. He could be a B1G difference maker for the offense.
nyjets,34ntr2,jetsfan07,7,Sat May 2 22:30:04 2015 UTC,"Not to mention he has Brandon Marshall to teach him how to pluck balls out of the air like it's no big deal, and Decker to show him how to run routes."
nyjets,34ntr2,_vsrs_,2,Sat May 2 22:34:22 2015 UTC,Damn. Decker Marshall kerley smith amaro. Damn
nyjets,34ox8g,mikerhoa,10,Sun May 3 05:11:06 2015 UTC,"The guys I wanted with that 7th rouner were Holliman or Eskridge, so I have nothing to complain about on that front  I think Mac looks at our O Line and says that it will do. If Carpenter can do better than in Seattle, Brick and Mangold remain the rocks they have been over the last decade. With the ever so slight progression of Oday Aboushi and Breno Giacomini reamining slightly above average we should be fine for the time being"
nyjets,34ox8g,jrg114,6,Sun May 3 05:32:03 2015 UTC,"This. We have a lot of OLine depth right now, and a couple of them haven't even been given a chance. Dakota Dozier just essentially had a redshirt year also. Between him, Colon, Aboushi, Carpenter, Winters, Harrison, and the other camp bodies, I think we can get some quality play, not to mention our Oline was ranked 16th, and we just added competition, so I think we'll get some good play. As for Gronk and O'Leary... Are we forgetting that Antonio Allen has notably played Gronk as well as anyone ever? Jarrett also seems to have some good range. Not to mention Todd Bowles changes where players line up on a regular based upon opponent, so I wouldn't be surprised if he wanted to line Cro up at FS to cover Scott Chandler as well. I'm just spitballing because he uses so many different looks, but I digress."
nyjets,34ox8g,jamtakno,3,Sun May 3 06:24:54 2015 UTC,Giacomini is far below average as far as RTs go. Back up caliber tackle.
nyjets,34ox8g,wcstyles,3,Sun May 3 17:21:14 2015 UTC,"you're right, not quite sure why I wrote slightly above, I was thinking slighly below, anyways my point still stand about Our O Lne position right now"
nyjets,34ox8g,jrg114,8,Sun May 3 17:26:41 2015 UTC,The oline is fine for this season. Allen has made gronk a non factor before. He's still on the team. Pryor is now in his rightful position of ss so he will perform better. Did you forget we signed Gilchrist? He will play fs which he's been good at. Jarret has shown big play potential as well. The safeties will be fine with our cb and line play.
nyjets,34ox8g,John_YJKR,3,Sun May 3 07:03:12 2015 UTC,"Allen has not made Gronk a non-factor at all. If your referring to that one game in 2013, he had 8 receptions for 114 yards. Talk to some chargers fans about Gilchrist, he is not some magical answer at FS. Chargers fans were pretty happy to get rid of him so that doesn't look like a good sign."
nyjets,34ox8g,Dacious96,2,Sun May 3 16:06:56 2015 UTC,Didn't they all say he played out of position?  Isn't that the same case for Pryor?   It's like saying Antonio Allen was horrible corner....well yea he's not a corner.
nyjets,34ox8g,Wellitjustgotreal,0,Sun May 3 16:36:34 2015 UTC,"They say he played FS in college and said he is better in the box. Not all FS = coverage safeties. Back in 2012 Laron Landry played FS for us and he is not a coverage safety at all. I'm not saying Gilchrist will be terrible because he has a lot of talent around him, just don't expect him to be Earl Thomas or be a probowl safety."
nyjets,34ox8g,Dacious96,2,Sun May 3 17:03:54 2015 UTC,Most of that yardage came against linebackers. When allen was on him he contained him well. Gilchrist was very productive and durable while in San diego. Chargers fans just needed a whipping boy. It really seems like they are whining about nothing with him. I wouldn't worry about the safeties as bowles likes to rotate a lot of them and they will have help.
nyjets,34ox8g,John_YJKR,-3,Sun May 3 18:51:13 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking Jarrett will win out over Gilchrist, who benefited greatly in SD from playing alongside Weddle, but has yet to show he can be a featured playmaker in the backfield. I like him, but I'm still a bit wary of him.  And there's really no guarantee that Pryor will miraculously snap to form. I sure as hell hope he does, and perhaps he will. But he took so many plays off last year I'm just not sure the problem was from him playing out of position.  We'll see. I truly hope you're right..."
nyjets,34ox8g,CoMaBlaCK,3,Sun May 3 14:56:55 2015 UTC,All I know is we were told we went BPA when we drafted a guy we didn't at all need and then seemed to draft for need when there was obviously better players available.   Now that the draft is over we didn't fill a single hole we had unless we struck gold with multiple late round guys which isn't likely.
nyjets,34ox8g,Bynie,-1,Sun May 3 20:01:48 2015 UTC,"It's certainly looking to be better than last year's though, but I can remember being quite fond of Idzik's picks as well."
nyjets,34ox8g,rvbcaboose1018,2,Sun May 3 20:40:57 2015 UTC,He can't fortify every position in 5 months....    Some teams take years to solidify every position.

nyjets,34o4j2,blinkme123,2,Sat May 2 23:24:46 2015 UTC,"I was interested in him leading up to the draft. He has a good nose for the ball and is a decent open-field tackler. His pass coverage skills, block-shedding skills, and motor are questionable though. If he works hard, I think he could be a solid special teams player."
nyjets,34o4j2,MasterCheftain,3,Sun May 3 00:08:39 2015 UTC,"He was actually projected to go in the 5th round. I was going on and on about wanting the Jets to draft him, and now we get him as an UDFA. Hell yeah!"
nyjets,34o4j2,CatfishHugo,3,Sun May 3 06:16:19 2015 UTC,"So dumb question, but is there a limit on how many UDFA's we pick up?"

nyjets,34mcc1,mikerhoa,17,Sat May 2 15:11:47 2015 UTC,but nobody wins trophies in May.   Tell that to the horses racing this weekend.
nyjets,34mcc1,SpygateHernandez,46,Sat May 2 15:57:12 2015 UTC,It's helpful when your allegedly shitty ex gm clears so much cap room
nyjets,34mcc1,scruffykid,42,Sat May 2 14:49:26 2015 UTC,"From where I sit it wasn't Idzik's cap managment that made him shitty. He did well (though he definitely should have signed a CB in 2014).  It was his abysmal drafting, hapless talent evaluation, and shameful handling of Rex that did him in. So let's not make him a martyr here..."
nyjets,34mcc1,mikerhoa,18,Sat May 2 15:08:12 2015 UTC,Agreed. His specialty was cap evaluation. He got an A+ for that. Everything else though F.  He just couldn't get the job done.

nyjets,34mcc1,mikerhoa,10,Sat May 2 16:00:56 2015 UTC,"Wide receiver was one of our biggest offseason needs last year and coincided with one of the best wide receiver draft classes in decades, and we got none of them. Izdik did a lot of dirty work in getting the cap back under control and he should be lauded for that, but he couldn't evaluate talent for shit."
nyjets,34mcc1,RodKimble_Stuntman,3,Sat May 2 18:33:44 2015 UTC,100% agree...
nyjets,34mcc1,mikerhoa,7,Sat May 2 19:52:39 2015 UTC,"The thing is, and this is an honest question, but how many late round draft picks pan out in general? After the third round it all seems like a crapshoot. Is this not the case? I mean I guess their players that need development, but then you can't pass judgment on Idzik for them."
nyjets,34mcc1,tokin_tlaloc,2,Sat May 2 16:22:28 2015 UTC,Twenty of the 44 starters in last years SB were drafted 4th round or later.   https://mobile.twitter.com/FieldYates/status/594493447299473409   Late round daft success is critical.
nyjets,34mcc1,sokol96,3,Sat May 2 21:41:53 2015 UTC,"Best case scenario, I'd say a starter from anywhere after the 4th round can be considered a success.  However, even if we remove every pick from after the 4th, we're still left with    Milliner and Pryor who are struggling mightily Injury busts in McDougle and Evans who probably won't make the team A murderers row of failure in Saunders, Winters, and Dozier And Geno   That's a pretty weak return..."
nyjets,34mcc1,mikerhoa,3,Sat May 2 16:29:26 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call Dozier a failure. Dude hasn't even played a snap yet. At least give him a chance.
nyjets,34mcc1,MasterCheftain,2,Sat May 2 20:03:19 2015 UTC,"Fair point.  But he wasn't exactly Gene Upshaw out there during the preseason, and if he does have ability now is the time to show it..."
nyjets,34mcc1,mikerhoa,5,Sat May 2 20:11:51 2015 UTC,We haven't been able to judge his drafts at all. In two years we will actually be able to see if Idzik was a shitty drafter
nyjets,34mcc1,Sir_Duke94,2,Sat May 2 16:35:49 2015 UTC,"I don't get why people still say this. Many of his picks are barely practice squad material, yet I see this sentiment all the time.  Yes, Tajh Boyd, Jeremiah George, William Campbell, Jalen Saunders, and the others are going to completely reverse course and become stars overnight. That is totally gonna happen.  If it does it will be one of the biggest miracles in NFL history."
nyjets,34mcc1,mikerhoa,4,Sat May 2 16:40:33 2015 UTC,"People keep saying this because we don't know how Dozier, Evans, Ik, Enunwa, Pryor, and Milliner will develop over the next few years and if they become starters, all-pros, probowlers, or busts"
nyjets,34mcc1,Sir_Duke94,2,Sat May 2 16:48:44 2015 UTC,"Like I said, it would be a stunning turnaround.  This isn't baseball. Players don't have the luxury of gestating in the minors for a few years before shit-or-get-off-the-pot time. Most of the time we learn a player's value right away. Coaches will see the potential and it will be brought out of them on the field.  If a player has trouble cracking a roster, and is constantly getting switched out for someone better, chances are he's not gonna amount to much.  Are there ""projects"" out there who grow into solid players? Sure! But those are pretty rare all things considered. And Idzik sure has a lot of those ""project"" type players to his name.  Shit, I hope his draft picks become stars! Nobody will be cheering harder than me, provided they're wearing Jets jerseys of course..."
nyjets,34mcc1,mikerhoa,6,Sat May 2 17:02:10 2015 UTC,it isn't a stunning turnaround half of those guys I mentioned have been in the NFL for a year. ONE YEAR it took Richard Sherman more than a year to develop. It is absolutely ridiculous to think that some guys that were drafted as projects would need some time to develop and you're calling it a stunning turnaround if they do
nyjets,34mcc1,Sir_Duke94,2,Sat May 2 17:10:54 2015 UTC,The fire-able offense IMO was going into the season with sub NFL quality CBs

The Jets came into the draft with a huge need at receiver, drafted two receivers, yet came away with none of those guys.  Idzik was out of his element from day one, he never had a clue about talent evaluation."

nyjets,34mcc1,jetsfan07,7,Sat May 2 14:50:35 2015 UTC,"I mean, any moron could have cut Cromartie, Sanchez and Holmes."
nyjets,34mcc1,ShadowDonut,2,Sat May 2 15:39:22 2015 UTC,The Cromartie cut was actually a mistake though. Cro was lightyears better than anything we had on the roster last year at the CB position and the only reason his last season with us was subpar was due to injury. They should've never let him walk.
nyjets,34mcc1,TresOcho,2,Sun May 3 00:44:31 2015 UTC,Cutting him had to be done. Not negotiating a reduced contract after cutting him was the mistake.
nyjets,34mcc1,ShadowDonut,2,Sun May 3 01:06:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Only a fool would keep a 30 year old CB whose game is based largely on athleticism and was coming off a horrible, injury-riddled 2013 season on the deal that Cro was signed to. But, he was well-liked in the locker room and it would've made sense to bring him back for a deal like the one the Cards got him on."
nyjets,34mcc1,blinkme123,5,Sun May 3 02:15:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that Idzik makes the same moves this offseason or at least he spends in FA. Having Rex forced on him might have been a death sentence.   But whatever now we got Maccagnan and Bowles and I'm fucking excited."
nyjets,34mcc1,arv98s,7,Sat May 2 15:02:59 2015 UTC,"It was really refreshing to watch the conference and listen to Macdaddy. Bowles hardly said anything and when he did talk, he was cool as a cucumber. He talked football and he's just very insightful."
nyjets,34mcc1,smacksaw,2,Sat May 2 15:26:36 2015 UTC,But the drafting has been...the best in decades.  Big difference.
nyjets,34mcc1,banana455,2,Sat May 2 18:45:03 2015 UTC,"He made ridiculously obvious cap decisions that any dunce with an ounce of common sense would have made. He didn't spend any fucking money at all after that, so yea he left us in a good cap position. He also left us with a 4 win team. Wow Idzik, what a genius"
nyjets,34mcc1,SpygateHernandez,3,Sat May 2 22:11:17 2015 UTC,"I understand why Idzik did what he did as far as the cap was concerned, but there's no defending him when it comes to the draft.  Now, you may say, ""what about Sheldon?"" but given the rest of how badly he messed everything else up I'm going to attribute that one to luck."

nyjets,34mcc1,Assjuic3,5,Sat May 2 16:32:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, but Vick and his ""Dream Team"" seemed good on paper too. I wouldn't shoot the gun just yet."
nyjets,34ni5u,echoplex21,15,Sat May 2 19:54:42 2015 UTC,They were both at the voluntary minicamps. Both limited to individual drills and doing the walk-through for the defense team period. Dee milliner especially was noted either stood or kneeled next to revis and Cro asking questions trying to learn more. Not sure if they gave a time table but I would assume they would be ready by the latest the start of the season.  Edit: spelling.
nyjets,34ni5u,JYB16,3,Sat May 2 20:18:02 2015 UTC,"And we still have Buster Skrine as well to add to that list.  I was gonna mention the same thing about Milliner asking Cro and Revis questions on the sidelines.  I can't remember who reported that but I saw it in a tweet.  I know this wasn't a part of OP's question but I wonder about Shaq Evans too...  We're loaded at WR right now too. Devin Smith, Marshall, Decker, Kerley, am I missing smoeone?"
nyjets,34ni5u,ScorchG,6,Sat May 2 20:29:17 2015 UTC,"Salas, Graham, Enunwa, the dude we got from Houston"

nyjets,34mtel,jetsfan07,13,Sat May 2 16:18:02 2015 UTC,Bryce Petty! Yes!!
nyjets,34mtel,tresonce,5,Sat May 2 16:22:10 2015 UTC,Did we give up anything? We only went up one pick? Da fuck.
nyjets,34mtel,arv98s,6,Sat May 2 16:22:14 2015 UTC,Looks like they trade one of the 7th round picks they had.
nyjets,34mtel,hjames9,3,Sat May 2 16:25:59 2015 UTC,Well we got one yesterday so no real loss.
nyjets,34mtel,rvbcaboose1018,3,Sat May 2 16:26:54 2015 UTC,it was that one that we traded
nyjets,34mtel,Deigs,2,Sat May 2 16:27:19 2015 UTC,Jags had trade set up with Browns who wanted to take Petty also. Jets wanted to jump them for him and Jags took our deal since they only fell back one spot.   Edit: Jets only had to throw in one of their 7th rounders to move up.
nyjets,34mtel,SpygateHernandez,4,Sat May 2 17:03:52 2015 UTC,Quarterback controversy time!
nyjets,34mtel,Deigs,5,Sat May 2 16:21:55 2015 UTC,Not even. 0% chance Petty starts this year.   Edit: barring some catastrophic injury to both our QBs and possibly Matt Sims because they'd probably consider playing him over Petty too.
nyjets,34mtel,SpygateHernandez,9,Sat May 2 16:42:41 2015 UTC,I guarantee you that the great unwashed masses will be screaming at Bowles to start Petty after Geno throws his first pick.
nyjets,34mtel,Deigs,5,Sat May 2 16:59:19 2015 UTC,That's why they got Fitz.
nyjets,34mtel,SpygateHernandez,-1,Sat May 2 17:02:33 2015 UTC,I love Fitz but he's just not good.
nyjets,34mtel,Realistik84,3,Sat May 2 17:04:09 2015 UTC,Not great - but above average and good enough.
nyjets,34mtel,BootRecognition,2,Sat May 2 17:58:19 2015 UTC,And his best years were under Gailey if memory serves
nyjets,34mtel,DatGrag,1 point,Sat May 2 19:17:42 2015 UTC,He's definitely not above average as a starting QB
nyjets,34mtel,SpygateHernandez,0,Sat May 2 21:05:42 2015 UTC,"Fitz? Look, Fitz is a cool guy, but he's not going to lead us (or anyone for that matter) to a winning record."
nyjets,34mtel,Steph360WithTheWrist,6,Sat May 2 20:00:31 2015 UTC,We went 8-8 with Geno Smith turning the ball over twice a game just 2 years ago. Not to mention all the 1 possession games we lost early this past season. Now we have a way better roster. If we can get a guy to just not throw more picks than touchdowns we're a playoff team. Fitz could be that guy. Not saying he'll bring us a Super Bowl but he's the best option we have
nyjets,34mtel,SpygateHernandez,1 point,Sat May 2 20:10:29 2015 UTC,Sadly I think you're completely correct.
nyjets,34mtel,Realistik84,1 point,Sat May 2 20:39:05 2015 UTC,No - because anywhere he has been he has played pretty damn good.  He had good numbers last year and in BUF
nyjets,34mtel,SpygateHernandez,2,Sat May 2 21:36:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree. He has a sub-80 career passer rating, and his numbers last year were greatly inflated by his performance against Tennessee where he threw six touchdowns. Outside of that he was very up and down.   Fitz is a good guy, but he has a 33-55 career record for a reason."
nyjets,34mtel,Realistik84,1 point,Sat May 2 23:08:14 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as inflated.  Did he throw them?  Also don't ever let me see you rip Genos numbers without adjusting for ""deflation"" vs Buffalo....  I will never claim he is good - but with Chan and this offensive talent he could be a playoff QB"
nyjets,34mtel,sharked,1 point,Sat May 2 23:17:54 2015 UTC,Fitz was a beast last year until he got hurt.

nyjets,34mtel,Deigs,2,Sat May 2 20:06:01 2015 UTC,Gave up a 7th rounder
nyjets,34mtel,matap821,1 point,Sat May 2 20:15:19 2015 UTC,Thanks. For some reason I couldn't find what the trade was. Which 7th was it? The Texans' 7th?

nyjets,34mtel,Realistik84,-6,Sat May 2 22:07:59 2015 UTC,"Apparently Cleveland was about to draft him. If that's not an indictment for a QB I don't know what is.   I hate this pick. Hundley is better but I would've gone Clemmins, Tre Jackson or even Collins."
nyjets,34mtel,RodKimble_Stuntman,4,Sat May 2 16:41:00 2015 UTC,Huntley lost respect for not attending Senior week.  Also - I trust Gil Brandt more than you.
nyjets,34mtel,Realistik84,2,Sat May 2 18:25:04 2015 UTC,"Hundley wasn't a senior, he declared for the draft as an underclassman. There's no way he could've gone to Senior Week. Idk where you're getting your information"

nyjets,34n2pa,NannigarCire,3,Sat May 2 18:08:43 2015 UTC,"His tape makes him look like what we lack: incredible speed of the edge and his motor is insane. He looks to be a nightmare to compliment our insane D-line. We will have the best defense in the league. If we can get a young safety/corner gem in the end of the draft for the future, we will have a long lasting incredible defense."
nyjets,34n2pa,NannigarCire,5,Sat May 2 18:19:45 2015 UTC,"I wasn't that impressed with the tape tbh. I don't think he has the speed at all but he's a high motor (like you said) and high upper body strength type of guy. Looks like a real technician more than an upside athlete. Nice grab-and-pulls and swm moves. Saw some bend in him too. Definitely seems like he can start immediately on pass rushing downs, but his run defense was so bad. Probably because he's so tall."
nyjets,34n2pa,latman,3,Sat May 2 18:37:52 2015 UTC,"Run defense is not a need. Pass rushing is one, and landing a BPA need is brilliant. I'm just saying that this guy went under the radar but could be as lethal as a Top Pass Rusher. In the end, you need to understand that this is a new regime, so players will be replaced with players of different skill sets. I have full faith in Bowles to coach this man just like he does with his pass rushers."
nyjets,34n2pa,woodchips24,1 point,Sat May 2 18:46:00 2015 UTC,"I know it's not a need, but i'm just saying he doesn't have it. Who know's what's going to happen in 3 years, maybe it'll be a need then. I like to look at the all around game of players. I don't know if he was the BPA pass rusher though. I don't think his tape looked all that strong but i don't know how the rest of the OLB's remaining's tape looked, so i can't make much more of a comment than that."
nyjets,34n2pa,adamthewordking,4,Sat May 2 18:47:36 2015 UTC,Incredible speed?

nyjets,34n2pa,finkej2,3,Sat May 2 19:52:14 2015 UTC,The first two yards is in the head though.  Getting to the qb and being quick over 40 yards are different things.

nyjets,34mu87,arv98s,5,Sat May 2 16:39:38 2015 UTC,Jags also had a trade set up with the Browns who planned on taking Petty. Jets wanted to jump them for it and Jags took it since they only fell back one spot and still got to take their guy.

nyjets,34nki7,Superjam83,3,Sat May 2 20:36:53 2015 UTC,2 seventh round picks. I say Ifo and Collins. What do you have to lose?
nyjets,34nki7,ThreeCranes,2,Sat May 2 20:28:02 2015 UTC,If you draft Collins he will sit out and enter the draft in 2016. However if he becomes undrafted he cant re enter the draft in 2016.
nyjets,34nki7,Nebkreb,2,Sat May 2 20:30:16 2015 UTC,Ifo would be a good future play at CB - he can rehab this year behind our new-found depth.  Durell Eskridge at FS (go Cuse!)  Gerod Holliman for FS would also be good value.  Tre McBride might be a nice special teams/KR addition  Corey Robinson and Sean Hickey are two possible Ts we could look for.  Trey DePriest out of Bama would a good ILB/special teamer - Alabama linebackers always seem to succeed in NFL

nyjets,34kkj0,Futilemediocrity,10,Sat May 2 00:10:27 2015 UTC,"Of sorts, if you're referring to Brian Winter & Aboushi.  You need depth on the O-line.  When a team can field 5 ""solid"" starters, but no credible backups when one goes down, that's being short of OL.  Right now, the Jets are short a ""credible"" starting RG, so they Jets are behind the 8-ball in terms of a stable O-line.  But supposedly, this year is mediocre for OLs anyway.  It would be sweet if the later round picks could actually make the 53 man roster, and the practice squad had development players that could actually make the active squad next year."

nyjets,34kkj0,JDandJets00,13,Sat May 2 00:18:05 2015 UTC,"So Devin Smith is coming in as a straight deep threat with the ability to adjust to plenty of poor throws, and he's got the potential to turn into a legitimate low end WR1 type. He's great for our current team, since he takes up a role no one else can really provide of being the deep man, and has good but not great long-term potential. Geno's deep ball isn't perfect, but he can place it well enough that as long as it's near Smith he can adjust, track and catch it aggressively.  I'm a fan of this pick. I'm very happy we're staying away from Strong.  For those that know Matt Waldman, he had him as the 8th best WR in the class."

nyjets,34kkj0,crautzalat,10,Fri May 1 23:41:13 2015 UTC,I fully endorse this view. We all tend to forget that Geno is a remarkably accurate deep thrower. (Led the league in pass accuracy on attempts over 20 yards in his rookie year.) Low risk high reward pick.
nyjets,34kkj0,cbssz,8,Fri May 1 23:54:56 2015 UTC,"remarkably accurate deep thrower   I'd walk that back a little bit. He didn't fare very well throwing the deep ball last year, and don't tell me you don't cringe every time he goes long over the middle..."
nyjets,34kkj0,mikerhoa,5,Sat May 2 00:07:38 2015 UTC,"That's why I said ""rookie year.""  And apologies, he ended that year as the 7th most accurate QB on passes 20+ yards. That Falcons game skewed it earlier on in the year."
nyjets,34kkj0,cbssz,1 point,Sat May 2 00:18:20 2015 UTC,"To be fair, who was going for deep balls last year? Our fastest receiver was a limping Eric Decker. Geno proved he had something with a deep ball when Holmes was our limping deep threat."
nyjets,34kkj0,jetsfan07,1 point,Sat May 2 15:31:00 2015 UTC,"Holmes was healthy, and so was Hill, but you're acting like he racked up 4,000 yards in his rookie year by throwing deep, which he certainly did not..."
nyjets,34kkj0,mikerhoa,1 point,Sat May 2 16:02:00 2015 UTC,"Right. Holmes was healthy. That's why he has signed elsewhere and since been productive. I never said anything about Hill, who is worse than Darrius Heyward Bey. At least Bey makes the active roster. You can feed your own delusions as much as you want. This team has never had a good deep threat."
nyjets,34kkj0,jetsfan07,1 point,Sat May 2 16:04:37 2015 UTC,"Whoa, slow down. We both want the same thing.  Holmes hasn't been productive. He had 8 catches last year.  And I understand Hill was shitty. I'm saying that Geno's rookie year shouldn't be looked at as proof he can throw the deep ball. It doesn't matter who's out there. Geno makes too many bad reads and locks onto targets. He's turnover prone, especially deep.  I bet if he had Rice and Taylor out there he'd still turn it over at the same rate..."
nyjets,34kkj0,mikerhoa,1 point,Sat May 2 16:09:35 2015 UTC,"I think your impression of Geno's deep ball is skewed by that Bills game with Harvin. He has never been a bad deep passer. Take out that one game (and possibly others that he forced it to Harvin) and he's at least average at the deep ball. Yeah, he locks onto targets and makes bad decisions, but he has no problem getting the ball out to people."
nyjets,34kkj0,jetsfan07,2,Sat May 2 16:14:11 2015 UTC,"Fans are overrating the Jet WR stable, in terms of numbers.  Most fans will see 3 credible receivers, and call it a day.  But the Jets will be running a pure spread offense; the Jets need lots of WRs, TEs, & pass-catching RBs, even on the bench.   If too many of our current receivers go down (say 2), and gets replaced with Gates & Salas types, the offense will shuts down.  Right now, it looks exceptionally good.  We got a rookie WR1 who can help spread the defense away from Decker & Marshall, and still have Amaro & Kerley as options.  But there's no depth when one of them goes down.  Hopefully Ivory or Ridley get better at catching short passes;  Powell really only goes in for designed plays.  Which means we're probably short a pass catching RB, TE, & still need capable WRs riding the bench."
nyjets,34kkj0,sameolejets,17,Sat May 2 01:52:06 2015 UTC,Finally a good pick. Far better option for the jets than DGB or Strong
nyjets,34kkj0,tgrabowy717,4,Fri May 1 23:36:00 2015 UTC,Could you explain why? I was damn impressed by him in the final few games for OSU but I also really like Jaelen Strong
nyjets,34kkj0,JacobBo,19,Fri May 1 23:38:37 2015 UTC,"No I like Strong too and I like DGB. But they are both RZ threat possession type receivers. We already have two of those with Marshall and Decker, so getting a speedy guy that can stretch the field is far more important for the team."

nyjets,34kkj0,BCRplus44,5,Sat May 2 00:00:36 2015 UTC,Anything offensive is fine by me. Macdaddy knows his players. I have trust in this pick
nyjets,34kkj0,Adrian_mx,4,Fri May 1 23:35:44 2015 UTC,I mean I wanted gregory  but im fine with this needed a deep threat
nyjets,34kkj0,anon5848,4,Fri May 1 23:39:30 2015 UTC,We need a QB now...
nyjets,34kkj0,mikerhoa,1 point,Fri May 1 23:58:11 2015 UTC,"Fitzpatrick has played in Gailey's spread, with way less capable receivers and shakier O-line.  Supposedly, this is Geno's offensive background (the spread offense).  The Jets still have holes such that I really don't even want to take a developmental QB with the 3rd & 4th picks."
nyjets,34kkj0,sameolejets,2,Sat May 2 02:06:19 2015 UTC,"I can see Fitzpatrick hoisting the Lombardi Trophy about as much as can see Geno hoisting it.   Maybe they can Doug Williams or Trent Dilfer their way to a Chip, but I seriously doubt it..."
nyjets,34kkj0,mikerhoa,0,Sat May 2 02:19:35 2015 UTC,"Right now, the way the draft (& free agency) is going, I think the Jets are almost guaranteed to make the playoffs if Fitz starts.  The Jets will put up points like mad, compared to previous seasons.  Look at what Buffalo did with Kyle Orton.  You mean Trent Dilfer.  IIRC, Doug Williams was supposed to be a good QB, way better than his Tampa Bay record.  Fitzpatrick is not a basket case; he's just not an elite QB.  Whether its Stafford or Tannenhill level is anyone's quess.  Fitz is north of the Andy Dalton line.  Of course, the Jets would get crushed by the first competent defense in the playoffs, particularly if its with a dinosaur offense, because I don't ""believe"" in spread offenses."
nyjets,34kkj0,sameolejets,5,Sat May 2 02:59:43 2015 UTC,Devin will be a great choice for you guys.

nyjets,34kkj0,Sil5286,6,Fri May 1 23:43:58 2015 UTC,"He has explosive speed, tracks the ball exceptionally well, and has good hands. Additionally he's a contributor on special teams. Strong is a different kind of receiver, and who is better depends on the style of offense and the needs (on paper at least).  Beckham is the best of the three on paper, but he also has huge red flags. Think of it this way, Josh Gordon is a hell of a receiver, but he does nothing for you if he's sitting on his couch. DGB carries the same risk."

In all honesty i was very uhggg about the Calvin Pryor pick because I was still butthurt about the break up but now I've come to appreciate what a great experience it was I'm ecstatic with the Mauldin pick (Who may have been on that team) and on an unrelated note happy to have come to terms with what's happened personally and can now say I'm a Cards supporter.

nyjets,34l3g5,mosherd14,4,Sat May 2 02:58:09 2015 UTC,"For real. There's a handful of qbs that took a while to develop. Geno was a 2 year starter in a non traditional offense in college. I'm the first person to say he was a 25-30 ranked qb last year. Just off the top of my head, I'm pretty sure Brees, Romo, etc. all didn't have strong years until they were like 26-27. Drew Brees was on the same track as geno his first couple years then figured it out. Personally I don't think geno is the long term answer but he's better than any qb they draft."

nyjets,34l3g5,TheRooster27,1 point,Sat May 2 03:00:59 2015 UTC,Well to be honest last year was all over the place I suspect the front office had something to do with it. There was probably a lot of friction.

nyjets,34l3g5,sameolejets,13,Sat May 2 02:39:30 2015 UTC,Phenomenal curve ball there.
nyjets,34l3g5,lemonade1094,5,Sat May 2 02:43:14 2015 UTC,"Last year we ran 3-4 as our base defense, which means 3 lineman and 4 line backers. Naturally, out of the 4 line backers there are 2 'middle' and 2 'outside' linebackers. The middle linebackers typically cover zone or hit inside gaps on blitzes. The outside backers typically rush the edge or play on tight ends in coverage"
nyjets,34l3g5,sameolejets,3,Sat May 2 03:17:39 2015 UTC,"Or ""defend/close"" the edge, which implies not rushing the passer."
nyjets,34l3g5,Urethra2Xtreme,2,Sat May 2 02:42:33 2015 UTC,"Very true. Depending on the offensive play, they could have containment responsibility as well."
nyjets,34l3g5,TreSeven,1 point,Sat May 2 03:37:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd just say that what an OLB and MLB/ILB does is based on what responsibilities the DC assigns them; and that will determine how their stats will look.  Classic 80's 3-4 relied on the OLB to rush the ballcarrier.  But that job can readily be reassigned to the DE, even in a 3-4; you can move them around, like a J. J. Watt."
nyjets,34l3g5,The_Big_Daddy,3,Sat May 2 04:24:34 2015 UTC,Middle line backer is the QB of the defense and doesn't always rush and can even fall back into coverage. Usually if an outside line backer is in the game his job is to blitz. The MLB lines up behind the nose tackle and the OLBs on either side of the MLB.

nyjets,34kzg9,dismemberedalive,2,Sat May 2 03:36:34 2015 UTC,its better than what anyone says about him. hes just raw and unknown and needs a chance. hope hes still in good shape and his football iq is still high.
nyjets,34kzg9,Enders_Sack,18,Sat May 2 04:35:14 2015 UTC,Niceeeeee
nyjets,34kzg9,ExDiscoKittyCat,16,Sat May 2 01:57:51 2015 UTC,Drafted in 2012 and only has 22 catches. Mac gifted Strong to his buddy.
nyjets,34kzg9,Lukas327,12,Sat May 2 02:05:01 2015 UTC,I think it was more about depth than acquiring another WR. 2 late rounders and a 5th string receiver to move back 12 picks is a pretty decent trade.
nyjets,34kzg9,ExDiscoKittyCat,5,Sat May 2 03:14:11 2015 UTC,Posey has no value in my opinion. Camp body. I don't think we got close to value to move back. But I really like Mauldin so it worked out.
nyjets,34kzg9,tps222,9,Sat May 2 03:17:46 2015 UTC,We got a 5th we didn't have and an extra 7th
nyjets,34kzg9,JASPriest,2,Sat May 2 03:41:45 2015 UTC,"If Mauldin is who we would have picked at 70 than we just got a free backup WR, 5th round, and 7th round pick."
nyjets,34kzg9,sameolejets,-2,Sat May 2 16:38:00 2015 UTC,"Acquiring a WR is adding depth.  The Jets will run a spread offense; it needs more WRs on the roster.  The 7th rounder is useless.  I'm guessing the Jets were so apathetic with what was available, they could move down and add a meh(?) WR."
nyjets,34kzg9,ExDiscoKittyCat,5,Sat May 2 04:06:56 2015 UTC,"It's okay, Strong is awful. I'm very happy we missed out on him."
nyjets,34kzg9,arv98s,6,Sat May 2 02:05:23 2015 UTC,I love Strong. Great hands and fights for the ball in the air. But yeah it wouldn't have made much sense after drafting Smith.
nyjets,34kzg9,NoMoreBoozePlease,6,Sat May 2 02:07:49 2015 UTC,"See, i absolutely hate him. I think he has good hands only when he has to fight for the ball, but whenever he goes over the middle or has to stay on the ground he allows the ball to go into his chest. Plus the whole stiff as a board thing and no YAC capability. I just hated Strong's upside, i felt like he was already maxed out as a WR. I'm happy with the move."

Main difference is Posey had two major off the field issues but was more productive on the field with Terelle Pryor throwing to him.
nyjets,34kzg9,ExDiscoKittyCat,4,Sat May 2 14:22:34 2015 UTC,I would've rather we just taken Strong instead...
nyjets,34kzg9,GreatNYBalls,3,Sat May 2 02:09:42 2015 UTC,Would've been nonsensical to take WR two high rounds in a row when you can get 3 picks AND a depth player back.
nyjets,34kzg9,ExDiscoKittyCat,5,Sat May 2 03:16:04 2015 UTC,What do you like about Strong? I'm very against Strong and i'm curious why people are fans.

It makes the franchise seem small time. Like how the Islanders/Islanders fans seem to focus on their Rangers hate first and everything else second."
nyjets,34ikuo,MongoJazzy,0,Fri May 1 19:36:24 2015 UTC,"Oh is that what you wish?  LOL.  This has nothing to do w/hate - the Big Cat's job is going to be to Sack QBs, Tom Brady is a QB that he will be playing against, his job will be to sack Tom Brady.

nyjets,34ikuo,VALIS666,1 point,Fri May 1 20:46:26 2015 UTC,"Mongo, I am thinking you are borderline illiterate at this point.   It's a fun, harmless comment   Is what I said right at the top. I was not criticizing the player at all, just the Jets universe obsession with the Patriots. Fuck the Patriots, but also fuck talking about them so much."

Big Cat made a funny comment people (pats and jets fans alike) are allowed to laugh w/o triggering your anxieties about ""pandering to pats hate."""

We're talking like 3rd grade level grammar here, man, and I'm low functioning? Woo. You're on fire today. Like, actual fire, I'm guessing, which is hampering your ability to read and write clearly.  We can keep doing this, you can keep pitching me softballs and I can keep launching line drives, but I suspect we might be boring the audience at large at some point, so let's get back to the team. I'll see ya around."

nyjets,34ikuo,SeeDeez,0,Fri May 1 23:28:39 2015 UTC,I only if for some reason the schedules change and we play the Twatriots first week.
nyjets,34klgb,Adrian_mx,11,Fri May 1 23:39:18 2015 UTC,Hah immediately after I saw the pick I went and watched this video. If he can do something other than just the deep ball I think he will be good.
nyjets,34klgb,vidallr,5,Fri May 1 23:56:38 2015 UTC,http://draftbreakdown.com/players/devin-smith/  Watch a few of those videos. This dude is the definition of productive.
nyjets,34klgb,JeezusChristIII,4,Sat May 2 00:21:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know... that first grab was nuts, but after that he let almost every grab come into his body. 9/10 of those passes are gonna get swatted in the NFL away if tries to catch them like he was....Not ecstatic, but I've been wrong before."
nyjets,34klgb,elyankee23,5,Sat May 2 02:01:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think,this hands are exceptional. Granted, this is a highlight video but almost all those catches were contested. He snatched them. I think,this speed is fantastic and he has the ability to adjust to the ball as it gets to him. I like the pick. We have a solid receiving corps to build any QB around."
nyjets,34klgb,the_furry_stoner,1 point,Sat May 2 05:43:25 2015 UTC,I saw one or two snatched grabs. The rest seemed like either nice over the shoulder plays (as much thanks to the qb as smith) or plays in which he catches it in his gut. I will admit that a few of those seemed to better allow him to keep stride but I'd like to see him go and get the ball more. But all I know is this and like one other highlight reel.
nyjets,34klgb,elyankee23,1 point,Sat May 2 18:35:07 2015 UTC,"There were enough catches with the hands to make me happy. A lot of the balls seem a little underthrown. Also, it'd be nice if he grabbed the ball at a higher point."
nyjets,34klgb,kuyakew,3,Sat May 2 13:26:40 2015 UTC,Braxton Miller looks amazing on this highlight reel. Hopefully we take a look at him for next year.
nyjets,34klgb,nmada514,3,Sat May 2 00:14:03 2015 UTC,Is he #5? The first thing I said while watching this was I want whoever #5 is that's slingin that fucking ball around.
nyjets,34klgb,Deigs,3,Sat May 2 00:27:55 2015 UTC,Yeah he's #5. #12 Cardale Jones looked good also.
nyjets,34klgb,nmada514,2,Sat May 2 00:29:03 2015 UTC,"King Cardale, first of his name, lord of the shoe, destroyer of tides and slayer of ducks*  I'll go back to r/cfb now..."
nyjets,34klgb,TheDoubleL27,3,Sat May 2 07:47:03 2015 UTC,"I like that he catches the ball with hands unlike a former 2nd round pick of the Jets.   He catches the ball at a high point.  He has good speed.  From other videos:  I don't like that he can't block too well. He is okay at it.  He is not physical off the line. He sometimes get re-routed or knocked down.  Overall, the kid looks like what the Jets need. He catches and plays with effort. Some improvement and the kid will be really good for the Jets."
nyjets,34klgb,Redd-It-Here,2,Sat May 2 01:19:37 2015 UTC,"After watching this I'm sold on this kid.  This is exactly what we needed. Someone who can get down field fast and make a play.  Keeps the D honest and opens up the middle if the field for Deck, and Brandon.  I'm all in!"
nyjets,34klgb,Kozlow,1 point,Sat May 2 03:35:13 2015 UTC,Holy fuck he can track the ball.
nyjets,34klgb,therewasa,1 point,Sat May 2 11:54:12 2015 UTC,It will be great having a legit deep threat.  Gailey could really use this kid to help spread opponents defenses thin.

nyjets,34jl9y,narenare658,1 point,Fri May 1 20:09:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, they would then forfeit their pick until one later. The Bears would have gone and then us"
nyjets,34jl9y,mathees,5,Fri May 1 20:11:33 2015 UTC,Pretty sure you don't forfeit your pick but the next team can run to beat you to the podium with their pick.
nyjets,34jl9y,staiano,2,Sat May 2 02:06:34 2015 UTC,Woah that's unsettling but I don't think with that many war room eyes on the clock that will ever happen to anyone.

Ran really well there  5) Jay Ajayi - One of the top RB's left.   The only guy I don't want is Hundley. He is a complete project QB, I don't think he will turn out any better than Geno.

nyjets,34ith7,mikerhoa,26,Fri May 1 14:52:33 2015 UTC,I think this sub may have over reacted a bit regarding Mo's future with the team. He has 2 years left minimum if Mac wishes. Today's NFL and more importantly Bowles defense is all about flexibility and packages. The log jam is blown way out of proportion for Harrioson plays less than half of the snaps. Are we forgetting Wilkerson lining up over the nose on 3rd down with Rex? It happened relatively often. We preach BPA often and when it happens we get bummed out because it wasn't sexy like a skill position would've been. I love the pick and I love the process.
nyjets,34ith7,azzjuice,2,Fri May 1 16:01:43 2015 UTC,In two years the Jets are down to 110 million in cap space. If you don't think Maccagnan is taking that into consideration then you have a problem.

The teams goes no place with an offense in the 20's or worst which is where it has been the last 4 years [22, 25, 30, 25]. Where as the last 4 years we've had a D ranked 6, 11, 8 & 5.  Of the bottom 13 teams in offense last year only 1 made the playoffs, Arizona. Of the top 7 defenses in the league last year 1, 2 & 3 made the playoffs because they all have QBs. 4- 7 did not because they don't.  Now we could not draft a QB so you had to go get an offensive play maker.  White was the pick in round one [with Cooper taken] and we blew it.  Hopefully we do better in round 2.  Gregory is not better.  I'll assume your post was not sarcasm but let me know if I was wrong."
nyjets,34ivgr,staiano,1 point,Fri May 1 19:53:07 2015 UTC,"Fitzpatrick was top 10 last year in QB rating, the offense will be better by virtue of him just being on the field. White was certainly not a must have with the starting spots locked up and talent available in the 2nd round-Strong/DGB  Marshall pushes Decker into a more comfortable role with a better qb: Amaro, who played very well at the end of the year, should be a more consistent threat: Ivory can still churn out yards, especially since teams will have to show at least a modicum of respect to the passing game. The offense will be able to move the ball, it probably wont be top ten, but it will be better than 20 and the D has a realistic shot of giving up 16-18 ppg.  The team right now doesn't necessarily have a NEED. They need a QB but there is not one here worth taking. OL is getting old and needs talent: there is a spot at OLB: they should spend a 1/2 on a WR within the next two years and they could use an upgrade at RB, but they can take the best available again. DGB/Strong are both excellent choices if availabe and Gregory would make this D something else this year and get it younger. Fisher too would be a good choice, but I would rather a WR and 3rd round guard. It is pretty hard to screw this up, seems there has to be a 1st round talent available at 37."

I was just concerned building a team solely on defense will not win.  If Strong is there in round 3 can we take a second WR?"
nyjets,34ivgr,staiano,7,Sat May 2 01:27:57 2015 UTC,I reallllly want them to take DGB.  I feel like him being in a position where he's not a focal point early on in his career will really allow him to develop into the stud that he can be and will keep his ego in check until he matures.
nyjets,34ivgr,partytimeboat,3,Fri May 1 16:23:13 2015 UTC,Truth. He could naturally progress as a receiever while learning from some amazing veterans. I think brandon marshall could really help him transition.

You've got 2 pro bowlers on the D line, with a top 5 pick and a better than average run stuffing NT and behind them is the best CB in football. In a 3 or 4 man front, the D line is going to smother most O-lines, leaving Harris and Davis to clean up anyone who get through and letting us drop 5-6 guys into coverage even on 1st down. The O is already playing 10-11 bc of the QB, with Wilk/Rich requiring at least 3 guys to stop, your now 7 on 9 for the rest of the team and one of those 9 in darelle revis.

At worst, they become backups to a new QB in a year, but i think all three have an outside chance of becoming a starter in a few years, so why not? )   Tevin Coleman (we could, again, wait to draft an RB, but honestly i wouldn't be surprised if we took one in the 2nd. Coleman is probably one of the better RB prospects with Gordon and Gurley gone. He seems like a decent runner and a decent receiver)    I think theres a ton of talent in the 2nd round, so I hope we make a deal and get another pick this round.

With a good team and coaching I think he could be our line backer for 10+ years. Never going to be a top 10 linebacker but will always be a consistent player which great character and work ethic.

That's also assuming Bowles is sticking with 3-4 for upcoming years and i know he has commented on sticking to 3-4, but is there any reason to not make the change to 4-3 base at this point? It's not like our personnel is incredibly out of position for it, i'm almost certain we have all but a true WLB. Hell, screw 4-3, we could run 4-2-5 90% of the time if we wanted to.

nyjets,34jmgs,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri May 1 21:03:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Jets have Damon Harrison and Leger Douzable can probably maintain some imitation of Leonard William's talent.   Isn't that the point though?  If we had a system where we can estimate the ""value added"" we'd basically take the production that we'd get from Leonard Williams, and the production that'd we'd get from what Douzable and Harrison will get, I don't think Williams was still the best player on the board. If anything we should have traded down, surely someone would have wanted Williams."

And there is probably some validity in the thought that Williams is Wilkerson-insurance, but again, we can always franchise Wilkerson if we can't reach a deal.  My point is that Williams is a long-term investment, and we know this guy will be here for five years. A lot of things can change in five years. Our needs will change.   We needed a right tackle to replace Woody in 2010, we needed a cornerback next to Revis, and we needed defensive lineman. Our needs will change every year, and some will be filled randomly by UDFAs and we'll lose players to injuries. It's the NFL."

nyjets,34gs8o,LJWIZZ,21,Fri May 1 01:09:34 2015 UTC,"Instead of thinking it as a ""traditional"" 4-3, think of it as a 3-4 that with substitutions seems like a 4-3, but not exactly.    The ""problem"" is that d-linemen are trained to hit certain holes, and they tend to be different when you line up 3-4 & 4-3.  It mostly affects reflexive responses.  This is what is meant by ""2-technique""/""3-technique/etc.""  Also, some d-linemen are schemed to go after the ballcarrier, but sometimes they're meant to plug a hole, be an ""edge"" defender, or help a LB into a gap (which means they aren't directly going after the ballcarrier).    Ryan was playing the Jets 4-3 around 30% of the time.  Its not like the Jets don't have the personnel to run it.  For a traditional 3-4, I was looking for an OLB edge rusher, like Vic Beasley; especially since the Jets should be looking to retire Pace.   But Bowles went a different way.    I guess Williams is so obviously a stronger player than Beasley, Williams was the BPA (Is he?).  We still get our 4 man blitz rush, but its inside, rather than outside.  The question is where do our linebackers go?  Is Coples good enough to play LB roles, or the Jets look to replace an LB?  Fret not, it was probably an excellent pick, ala Richardson.  The Jet pass rush will improve.   Personally, at pick time, I was leaning towards Kevin White (WR) or a tradedown instead."
nyjets,34gs8o,sameolejets,12,Fri May 1 01:34:28 2015 UTC,"Williams was the BPA (Is he?)   Williams was the highest rated player int he draft, so yes!"
nyjets,34gs8o,JASPriest,3,Fri May 1 04:00:23 2015 UTC,Wasnt winston rated just above him? I know its a QB tax but I thought he was the best prospect.
nyjets,34gs8o,shoelaces232,2,Fri May 1 16:18:24 2015 UTC,I suppose it depends on which site you look at. The rankings have also changed over the past few months.
nyjets,34gs8o,JASPriest,3,Fri May 1 16:41:43 2015 UTC,"Williams was definitely the value pick, it'll be interesting to see what happens in 2/3 as we still need to draft a rb, ol, olb, and probably a quarterback (Bryce petty where you at)"
nyjets,34gs8o,Alostsock,5,Fri May 1 04:06:14 2015 UTC,"Nah, we're okay with RB. Always can do better, but not for 2nd round.  WR1, OG, OLB.  Damn, I don't want to pick up a development QB in the 2nd round..."
nyjets,34gs8o,sameolejets,2,Fri May 1 04:17:11 2015 UTC,"I dunno man none of the guys really have any explosiveness. Ivory is great to get chunks cus he's a tank, and bilal is a question mark. If they're honestly giving geno one more season then adding a deep threat receiver, a rb, and a Man on the right side is the best bet."
nyjets,34gs8o,Alostsock,3,Fri May 1 04:42:06 2015 UTC,"1)  Chan Gailey runs a pass happy spread offense.  There are formations that have ZERO  RBs.  Running is an afterthought; trust me on that.  I'm actually not of fan of spread offenses; Adrian Petersen would probably be wasted on this team.  2)  There is no traditional power running in a spread offense.  All the OLinemen will be doing zone blocking.  So you want the kind of RBs who can find and hit a hole quick, and make his own yards, because he won't have an FB or TE or pulling guard helping him.  That is actually Ivory's & Ridley's strengths.  3)  Even with four pretty good recievers, it could end up being a lackluster squad, because the two primary receivers, Decker & Marshall, can't make space for themselves.  Thus the squad could really use a burner at WR1, who can actually catch the ball.  Its needed more than a new RB.  Also, because its a spread, if two of our receivers go down, the offense becomes a dead man walking."
nyjets,34gs8o,sameolejets,2,Fri May 1 05:00:37 2015 UTC,I mean obviously if we lose 2 of our 4 best receivers our offense will suffer... You could say that with any team in the league...
nyjets,34gs8o,nyjets10,2,Fri May 1 12:42:50 2015 UTC,"But because of the spread offense, the Jets could go 2012-2014 level bad if we lost 2 WRs to injury.  The other three would then be smothered, and the Jets would be more vulnerable to aggressive defenses, and no run game to fall back on.  (That's what it means to be a spread offense.)  Now if we got another speedster rookie WR1 & developmental possession WR, we plug them in, and the spread still functions, with less output.  If we had to replace WR1 & Decker with Clyde Gates & Greg Salas, its the same as having no receivers."
nyjets,34gs8o,sameolejets,2,Sat May 2 02:43:51 2015 UTC,"This team will be fine for one year with the RB's on the roster.If Jaelen Strong or DGB are available in the 2nd you almost have to take them. Strong is going to be a very good pro and DGB is a reciever in the Jones/Green mold. Yes, he has off-field concerns which could be exacerbated with Marshall, but the talent is high end.  Eli Harold would be solid although they may stay away from D after adding Williams. If they can't get Strong/DGB and don't want to take Harold my best guess is they trade down or take an O-lineman and look at RB/QB in the 3rd.  Also, are there actually people who want Geno to start over Fitzpatrick?"
nyjets,34gs8o,walkerstepbackwalker,13,Fri May 1 19:07:54 2015 UTC,"It's not difficult, in theory. In reality, it's all based on your personnel and what you hope to do on defense.   Players develop certain tendencies over time depending on what system they play in.   Some defensive players can play to their full potential in either scheme.   Some defensive players are molded for a specific role within either the 3-4 or 4-3 archetypes.   Here are some examples.  To begin with, the most fundamental difference between the two systems is that it tends to re-purpose and transform one set of positions: DE and OLB.   3-4 OLBs tend to rush the passer at a higher frequency than 4-3 OLBs, and are in a 3-point stance (they have their hand on the ground) most plays.   4-3 OLBs tend to be smaller, faster, and more apt to cover the pass rather than just rush the quarterback. They practically never get into a 3 point stance. Certain players that play OLB in a successful 3-4 scheme would be forced to change to DE in a 4-3 scheme because they can't cover TE's in the passing game.  3-4 Defenses are typically better suited to feature premier pass rushers, big and fast guys that play Outside Linebacker and tackle the quarterback. Think DeMarcus Ware, Mario Williams, Terrell Suggs. Usually these guys are classified as OLBs in 3-4 shemes, but if they were in 4-3 schemes they would play Defensive End.   3-4 also usually relies on an extremely big and/or physical Defensive Tackle, referred to as a ""Nose"" Tackle. This term is typically only applied to the 3-4 DT, signifying his place in the center of the line rather than staggered over the Offensive Guards.   Some players that would play DT in a 4-3 scheme would play DE in a 3-4 scheme. For example, Sheldon Richardson is a  3-4 DE that might play DT in a 4-3. Mo kind of fits the same mold, but he's a bit lighter than Richardson so he could probably play DE in a 4-3 as well.  Anyway, the point is that it's not a difficult change if your personnel fits what you're trying to do and everyone is comfortable within their role. Obviously thats easier said than done.  End novel lol"
nyjets,34gs8o,the_one_who_waits,2,Fri May 1 01:50:35 2015 UTC,"I consider myself to have a pretty good football knowledge as I played for most of my life growing up, but it's kinda hard for me to explain. With the right personnel, it wouldn't be difficult, it'd just be learning a new playbook. But most of our line are guys who are specialists in the 3-4 format, so it's harder for them to transition. I'm kinda buzzed right now from the draft so sorry if this is retarted."
nyjets,34gs8o,Cletus_Van_Dam,3,Fri May 1 01:24:37 2015 UTC,"Ehhhh, can Harris handle MLB?"
nyjets,34gs8o,matap821,19,Fri May 1 01:05:08 2015 UTC,Demario dude
nyjets,34gs8o,JDandJets00,6,Fri May 1 01:06:11 2015 UTC,"Harris is a prototypical 4-3 MLB.  He wouldn't get touched, and would be free to read and follow the ball on defense.  He's already a tackling machine, in the 4-3 he'd be responsible for finding the ball and reacting, while having to deal with offensive linemen coming at him much less"
nyjets,34gs8o,dirtyapeupvotes,4,Fri May 1 01:42:23 2015 UTC,"Good to know. I was just worried about covering TEs, but Bowles should be able to compensate with his secondary packages thinking about it."
nyjets,34gs8o,matap821,3,Fri May 1 01:44:45 2015 UTC,"But Harris is subpar pass defender, coupled with another subpar pass defender in Pryor.  Somebody has to cover Gronkowski (TE) and cheap, shifty slot receivers."
nyjets,34gs8o,sameolejets,3,Fri May 1 02:04:23 2015 UTC,"that's the beauty of the 4-3 for Harris.  In pass defense in most cases he'd be responsible for back out of the backfield, the two outside linebackers would be responsible for TE, so yeah, we'd have to get better there, but as far as Harris is concerned he would only benefit from this."
nyjets,34gs8o,dirtyapeupvotes,3,Fri May 1 02:10:06 2015 UTC,"In pass defense in most cases he'd be responsible for back out of the backfield   Yeah, I'm liking it a little more.  Doesn't help that Pryor can't defend the pass for shit.  Maybe a highlight looking tackle before he gets penalized for unnecessary roughness."
nyjets,34gs8o,sameolejets,3,Fri May 1 02:34:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed on Pryor, but with the defensive backfield we have now, we can actually utilize his talent as a hitter and play him in the box more"
nyjets,34gs8o,dirtyapeupvotes,3,Fri May 1 03:01:09 2015 UTC,I'm sure having Pryor and Harris in the box is sufficient.
nyjets,34gs8o,LookSuspicious,2,Fri May 1 01:06:31 2015 UTC,I'll give that a shot.
nyjets,34gs8o,matap821,2,Fri May 1 01:10:20 2015 UTC,Probably not. He should stick to the NFL imho.
nyjets,34gs8o,GMRox,2,Fri May 1 17:13:53 2015 UTC,Bowles said they're sticking to a 3-4 primary defense.
nyjets,34gs8o,27BronxBombers,2,Fri May 1 01:15:47 2015 UTC,Always open to change. Rex played a hell of a lot of snaps with four lineman the last two years.

nyjets,34gs8o,MisterTruth,7,Fri May 1 02:47:07 2015 UTC,"I envision it like event horizon, where Bowles bends space and time to allow his guys through hole that's the o line, and they come out right on the QB."
nyjets,34gs8o,97EchoEcho,34,Fri May 1 01:08:28 2015 UTC,These comments remind me of when Sheldon was drafted.
nyjets,34gs8o,Eogris,19,Fri May 1 01:01:12 2015 UTC,Except that Williams has more potential than Richardson ever did.
nyjets,34gs8o,BrutalJones,10,Fri May 1 01:55:39 2015 UTC,Williams is also only 20.
nyjets,34gs8o,beanburritobandit,6,Fri May 1 02:06:39 2015 UTC,"Then that pretty much means he's on his way to be the best Defensive Player in the League, JJ Watt Status, if he develops well. Richardson is a beast."
nyjets,34gs8o,CptMurphy,3,Fri May 1 03:51:22 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. He's Sheldon Richardson but bigger and more athletic. Phenomenal against the run and a very good pass rusher as well. He's a complete defensive lineman that can play anywhere on the line in either the 3-4 or the 4-3 because he's so strong, big, and fast. He's the single best prospect in the entire draft in my opinion and he could easily have been justified in going first overall.  It's funny that he ended up falling to us because I was discussing him with my friends immediately before the draft. Our consensus was that if he does fall to us, he absolutely must be taken, no matter how many DEs we already have on the roster. I'm still in shock that he fell out of the top-3, he has that much potential.  I have no idea how teams are going to run against us next year, and with Revis, Cro, and Skrine covering people you can look forward to Wilk, Richardson, and Williams compiling a ton of coverage sacks. I've been a Jet fan for 30 years now and I think we have an honest shot to field the best defense this team has ever had next season, New York Sack Exchange and early Rex years included."
nyjets,34gs8o,BrutalJones,4,Fri May 1 13:09:33 2015 UTC,Rex must be so pissed right now. It's like his dream defense.
nyjets,34gs8o,Manginaz,2,Fri May 1 14:31:27 2015 UTC,"I immediately thought of the two Buffalo games this season and chuckled. Matt Cassel and EJ Manuel against this defense is going to be laughable.  I'm sure Rex will talk up a storm like he always does, but their offense isn't going to be able to do shit against us. McCoy is their biggest weapon, but good luck running against this defensive line."
nyjets,34gs8o,BrutalJones,3,Fri May 1 17:15:20 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Geno going up against the Buffalo defense is also laughable."

nyjets,34gs8o,Viddstuff,3,Fri May 1 01:48:33 2015 UTC,"Shit, I guess it is kind of like 2013. I'm honestly just amazed he slipped to 6."
nyjets,34gs8o,Matt_holmgren,7,Fri May 1 02:01:15 2015 UTC,BPA. I like the pick for you guys. That pass rush is getting close to Rams level.
nyjets,34gs8o,Adrian_mx,48,Fri May 1 00:51:23 2015 UTC,"I cant believe williams fell to us wow.. This is amazing!  Edit: boys we're keeping Mo there is no reason why we would trade him or let him go. Hes a beast, a leader and a motivator on our defense. Our defense line is going to be INCREDIBLE.  Now the rest of our picks for the offense and we'll be going to the superbowl!! :P"
nyjets,34gs8o,tootie,4,Fri May 1 00:49:54 2015 UTC,"The Wilk question isn't about his worth, it's about his cost. Of course they want to keep him, but he's going to want a crippling contract pretty soon."
nyjets,34gs8o,sameolejets,2,Fri May 1 02:53:56 2015 UTC,"This is really the pick you wanted, and thought the Jets would never get?"
nyjets,34gs8o,akaneel,36,Fri May 1 00:54:58 2015 UTC,People who are angry with this pick seriously don't understand lol
nyjets,34gs8o,arv98s,11,Fri May 1 00:51:09 2015 UTC,Can you explain? I didn't even look into the guy because I had just heard he wasn't going to get past the top five.
nyjets,34gs8o,akaneel,19,Fri May 1 00:54:39 2015 UTC,"One of the best DL prospect in years hands down, ankle issues dropped his stock but I'm guessing it's over-exaggerated"
nyjets,34gs8o,arv98s,2,Fri May 1 00:56:39 2015 UTC,"So, what are we doing with our Dline? If we are still running a 3-4 who gets bumped?"
nyjets,34gs8o,ostrow19,3,Fri May 1 01:00:17 2015 UTC,Either a switch to a 4-3 or trade mo probably
nyjets,34gs8o,sameolejets,3,Fri May 1 01:07:14 2015 UTC,Or do what Ryan did and play 30% 4-3.  We'll get impact from ALL our DEs.  The absolute worst case scenarios is that Williams is a future Gholston (really unlikely) or Wilkerson gets traded for value.  (Can either Wilkerson or Williams play NT?)
nyjets,34gs8o,mattcor76,6,Fri May 1 01:49:07 2015 UTC,"He has talent but we needed to fulfill our offense needs with this pick, not defense. Plus it means we're probably going to lose wilkerson. I personally and disappointed but excited, williams still is easily the best defensive player in the draft."
nyjets,34gs8o,cyph3x,5,Fri May 1 00:59:33 2015 UTC,WR is deep and we can't take Peat or White at 6 with Williams sitting there I'll bet we grab one in the second depending how things play out
nyjets,34gs8o,TheGuardian8,4,Fri May 1 01:03:21 2015 UTC,OT in the second and WR in the 3rd sounds pretty good to me.
nyjets,34gs8o,akaneel,6,Fri May 1 01:04:58 2015 UTC,This means nothing towards trading Wilkerson. Dude's not going anywhere.
nyjets,34gs8o,FinntheHue,4,Fri May 1 01:00:33 2015 UTC,Trading Wilkerson this year would be the biggest blunder since Tebow.
nyjets,34gs8o,mattcor76,5,Fri May 1 01:42:24 2015 UTC,If we're not trading wilkerson then what do we need Williams for?
nyjets,34gs8o,woodchips24,2,Fri May 1 01:03:10 2015 UTC,Beasley could've been just as good at a position of greater need.
nyjets,34gs8o,i_wannatalktosamson,7,Fri May 1 01:05:27 2015 UTC,"Beasley is a one trick pony who is undersized and has average tape, I personally had him as my last OLB just barley below Shane Ray, I think if we can grab Gregory in the second round this draft is a grand slam"
nyjets,34gs8o,woodchips24,2,Fri May 1 02:09:18 2015 UTC,"Oh if we get Gregory in the 2nd I'll be doing backflips I'll be so happy. I just want an edge rusher to really set this defense off. Williams strikes me as more of the same with his ability to generate interior pressure, which we already have in Mo and Sheldon."
nyjets,34gs8o,jvene1,8,Fri May 1 05:20:39 2015 UTC,Beasley would have been a reach at 6.
nyjets,34gs8o,woodchips24,3,Fri May 1 06:57:19 2015 UTC,He was regularly being mocked to go at 3 or 5. Not a reach at all
nyjets,34gs8o,Assjuic3,2,Fri May 1 02:34:46 2015 UTC,"Even Gurley. He isn't a position of need, but he would have been been one of the better players on a position that scores."
nyjets,34gs8o,akaneel,2,Fri May 1 02:44:59 2015 UTC,To switch to a 4-3
nyjets,34gs8o,mattcor76,7,Fri May 1 02:42:24 2015 UTC,"I personally wasn't looking to improve our already above average defense with our first pick, but like I said Im optimistic. He's a beast and will most likely be useful. Doesn't change the fact that I'd like to have seen us draft White with this pick."
nyjets,34gs8o,sameolejets,3,Fri May 1 01:04:26 2015 UTC,"You need to watch his highlight reel.  He was a dominant receiver in the 2 years he started; he's not a Stephen Hill.  By physicality & WR traits alone, he would have ranked higher than Cooper.  Its only his disrupted college career that makes him less than a sure thing.  If Williams was absolutely better than Beasley & White (someone help me out here), and didn't expect to fall into our laps, I'd say we should be happy with the pick.  My problem is that I just don't know, not being a college football follower."
nyjets,34gs8o,NannigarCire,2,Fri May 1 01:07:57 2015 UTC,"That'snot true about White, he was already battling for the #1 WR spot before his combine. The rest is perfectly true. Also weird fact, high DL prospects have a very very high success rate. Higher than any other position."
nyjets,34gs8o,sameolejets,3,Fri May 1 01:14:43 2015 UTC,We will either keep Wilkerson or trade him for good value.  Both of them will still have an impact on the defense.
nyjets,34gs8o,pnoozi,1 point,Fri May 1 01:43:35 2015 UTC,"Was there any offensive player worth picking?  Just pick the best player, I have no problem with that.  This dude looks like a beast."
nyjets,34gs8o,ontopic,3,Fri May 1 01:16:18 2015 UTC,"For me, the big issue is that this keeps the ""Trade Mo"" story alive, and I think that's a mistake unless the trade involves a franchise QB under 30, which it won't."

nyjets,34gs8o,LookSuspicious,13,Fri May 1 01:09:46 2015 UTC,What?!? My initial reaction was excitement. I would have never guessed this. We went BPA. I wouldn't doubt a trade.
nyjets,34gs8o,NannigarCire,15,Fri May 1 01:57:55 2015 UTC,"I'm all for this pick. Williams can't play NT right now, but he can gain the weight to play the position. Even if he doesn't, as a 4-3 team we now have the most ridiculous line. Williams was by far the best prospect in this draft and there's nothing wrong with grabbing the best prospect on the board imo. Just hoping we keep Wilkerson."
nyjets,34gs8o,Bynie,14,Fri May 1 01:10:28 2015 UTC,Sheldon. Mo. Leonard. Damon.   Yikes. The snack exchange is here.

nyjets,34gs8o,Bynie,2,Fri May 1 01:00:01 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. That's beyond my scope as a fan. Obviously they wouldn't draft him if they can't find a place to use him. I wanted cooper or white if they were there because I never thought Williams would drop to six. There are still 2-3 very good WR prospects still on the board. I think strong, smith, dgb. It's just hard to be upset about taking Williams. If they drafted Beasley over white, I would have flipped my shit."
nyjets,34gs8o,JASPriest,10,Fri May 1 04:25:40 2015 UTC,Wow. We stuck with best player available!!!
nyjets,34gs8o,JDandJets00,5,Fri May 1 05:21:57 2015 UTC,"Can't hate it, we see how he plays in some 4-3 looks this year, if he looks like he can be just as good as Wilk, we save a lot of money, if not, we pay Wilk and have the best run D in league history.   Actually, I have no idea whats going on."
nyjets,34gs8o,JASPriest,3,Fri May 1 12:19:04 2015 UTC,"We either, but getting the highest rated prospect with the 6th pick has to be a good thing. Right?"
nyjets,34gs8o,JDandJets00,3,Fri May 1 00:52:58 2015 UTC,Ya in the long run definitely. Next years gonna be awkward in those D-Line meetings unless Wilk gets an extension though
nyjets,34gs8o,JASPriest,2,Fri May 1 01:01:00 2015 UTC,Big Mac has said he wasn't gonna talk contract extensions until after the draft. Which makes sense since he is a first year GM and didn't have as much time as other GMs to put together a game plan. So I'm sure we will give Mo an extension.

If you cover the middle of the field it takes away a lot of options in madden. If they have a receiver cut in side you know its going to him and you cut in front.

I am all for trading Snacks, I think his skillset is redundant on this team and I would rather keep Mo 10000 times out of 10. Maybe package our 6th or 7th with Snacks to move to #41 or #42. At that point we would have three players taken in the top 50, great for a building team.

nyjets,34i3f3,OneManArmy77,1 point,Fri May 1 21:21:08 2015 UTC,"He is on a one year contract, No one is going to give us a 3rd for him for one year unless they work out an extension and even then I highly doubt it."

nyjets,34i3f3,Shadune,2,Fri May 1 14:07:03 2015 UTC,LOL of course you take it but no one is going to offer that. We had a second round tender on him for weeks where anyone could have taken him and they didn't. No one is giving a 3rd round pick for him  Also if anyone did they would have the contract sealed up before they did it.
nyjets,34i3f3,Shadune,1 point,Fri May 1 14:17:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, I never said that we will trade him. He is a UFA next year. I think they just let him walk. He only played 47% of the snaps last year."
nyjets,34i3f3,Futilemediocrity,9,Fri May 1 12:17:03 2015 UTC,"Which is why I think they'll be able to afford to keep him. I don't think this pick is about replacing anybody. It's about turning a position of strength into a weapon of mass destruction.   On passing downs you can mix and match Wilk, Richardson, Williams and Coples any which way you like. That's nasty."
nyjets,34i3f3,donat28,2,Fri May 1 12:22:19 2015 UTC,"I think that Snacks wants a 4-5 year contract at 5+ a year. I do not think the Jets want to pay that. Also while you are correct that you can mix and match them anyway you want, you would want them all on the field as much as possible."
nyjets,34i3f3,AbortedFetusAMA,2,Fri May 1 12:33:40 2015 UTC,"Mac and Bowles are still a mystery at this point, so it's hard to say for sure what they have planned. They certainly have options.   Can't wait to see how it all shakes out."

nyjets,34i3f3,donat28,6,Fri May 1 12:35:14 2015 UTC,"People are quick to say silly things.  This is all about talent and leverage.  You can never have enough talent on a team.  If it's a strength, then you trade from it and improve other parts of the team.  Williams was simply too good to not draft.  This way, Mo has less leverage in any sort of negotiation (means Jets will save more money for other players) and if the worst thing happens (he is no longer a Jet) you are still covered.  But what is more likely is that they will let Mo play out his deal and then tag him next year"
nyjets,34i3f3,donat28,1 point,Fri May 1 13:42:10 2015 UTC,"Will it be worth it to give him 16M or whatever the tag will be? Any extension after that he'll want more.  He is a stud, but he's going to expect a contract almost as big as Watt"
nyjets,34i3f3,donat28,1 point,Fri May 1 22:39:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know enough about the cap to say if it's worth it.  The dude is an amazing player, but 16M sounds like a lot of money.  I know they won't be able to keep the d-line together.  You can't pay Richardson and Mo and Harrison and now Williams, so someone has to go.  Ideally, you get all of them to sign reasonable deals that make it work - if not, hopefully you can package one of them to get some assets."
nyjets,34i3f3,donat28,0,Sat May 2 02:08:12 2015 UTC,"Mo has less leverage in any sort of negotiation   People say this but I does not make any sense to me. It is only leverage if Mo wants to play here so badly he is willing to take less than what he can command somewhere else. How badly or now not so badly we need him have nothing to do with his market value. We are not the only show in town, Mo is going to get paid somewhere."
nyjets,34i3f3,king_kong_,10,Fri May 1 13:59:59 2015 UTC,"that's not what I mean.  consider the JETS if we didn't draft Williams.  Wilk is holding out of camp for a contract.  The JETS will likely be forced to move on that or else face the risk of having him sit out into the season etc.  now look at it with Williams there...Mo holds out? No big deal - you plug in Williams.  Now, you have the leverage to trade Mo...to offer him a contract deal that you feel is right etc.  This has nothing to do with Mo being paid elsewhere because he is under control of the NY Jets.  And if they want, they can franchise tag him next year and he will still be a Jet."
nyjets,34i3f3,BlackoutMurray,-4,Fri May 1 14:04:53 2015 UTC,"This way, Mo has less leverage in any sort of negotiation (means Jets will save more money for other players)    Mo is not going to take any less money just because we have Williams now, we will not save anything. Not to mention as you said he was never holding out to begin with considering he would have to sit out for two years due to the franchise tag.  There is a reason holdouts are pretty much a thing of the past."
nyjets,34i3f3,BlackoutMurray,8,Fri May 1 14:12:58 2015 UTC,I think you don't understand what the word leverage means.  I'm not sure how to say it any clearer...having a competent backup for a player on your team gives you LEVERAGE when dealing with that player.
nyjets,34i3f3,-bangarang,-3,Fri May 1 14:15:40 2015 UTC,"It does not give you leverage at all. All it does is mean you are not screwed if the player leaves.  Lets look at this with two possibilities.  Scenario one - We do not draft Williams. Mo says I want 6 years, 100 million dollars. The Jets say, we really want you mo but we don't want to pay it. He walks and gets that somewhere else.  Scenario two - We do draft Williams. Mo says I want 6 years, 100 million dollars. The Jets say, We just drafted Williams and we don't want to pay it. He walks and gets that somewhere else.  He is going to get his payday regardless, the only difference is it might not be here. All Williams does is make it that the Jets might be more inclined to let him walk and won't have such a drop off in talent on the line.  It in no way would get us a better price or as you said, save us any money."
nyjets,34i3f3,Superjam83,5,Fri May 1 14:28:18 2015 UTC,"It does not give you leverage at all. All it does is mean you are not screwed if the player leaves.   That's pretty much what leverage is dude.  Without Williams, the team would be stupid to not pony up whatever Mo wants.  With Williams, he is more willing to play ball because we don't need him as much.  He can't just walk.  He is under contract to the Jets.  And then if they want to keep him after that, you franchise tag him and he isn't going anywhere."
nyjets,34i3f3,NannigarCire,-1,Fri May 1 17:26:10 2015 UTC,"With Williams, he is more willing to play ball because we don't need him as much.   Tell me exactly what you mean by that.   He is under contract to the Jets. And then if they want to keep him after that, you franchise tag him and he isn't going anywhere.   Which would still be true whether we drafted Williams or not which is why Williams does not matter in the negotiations. Also he will get paid 15 million dollars when he is franchised so he will be getting paid."

nyjets,34i3f3,redline42,-1,Sat May 2 02:02:39 2015 UTC,"Every single person here who has talked about leverage and not one can explain how signing Williams will get us a better deal on Mo, because it simply is not true.  There are multiple teams that would sign him to a 6 year 90-100 million dollar contract today if they could. If he wants to get that contract, which he does, and we don't want to pay it someone else will. Williams give us a safety net if we don't sign him but he does not lower Wilkerson's value in the market."
nyjets,34i3f3,shoelaces232,2,Sat May 2 02:15:51 2015 UTC,"We may be more inclined to pay if we don't have Williams - in that sense we do get more leverage. Mo may be willing to negotiate because we are able to let him walk. If we don't have Williams he knows we're in a bind and need to sign him so he may demand more money.  Your assumption is that he is willing to pick up and leave for more money - I don't agree with that.   I guess it's not that we have leverage - it's that Mo loses a little leverage. Regardless, we sign him."

nyjets,34i3f3,Jimla,2,Sat May 2 01:10:54 2015 UTC,Totally disagree. Snacks is a run blocking nose tackle. Our DL is versatile but he still does that best. And as were still running a 34 he is still important on rushing downs.
nyjets,34i3f3,BlackoutMurray,1 point,Fri May 1 16:33:04 2015 UTC,This is a good point. Both players are FA at the end of the year. We can only keep one. This DL will be sick this year.
nyjets,34i3f3,John_YJKR,1 point,Fri May 1 12:42:50 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what i've been saying on the sub too since last night. Williams can put on the weight and play nose over the next year. I'm sure we'll even see Williams at nose before he puts on weight this year, just to see how he does as a lightweight in the position. Even if he doesn't, it's not like Bowles is a 3-4 on every down player, we'll see a switch in the base if we're getting more productivity out of the 4-3.  Marshall's cap hit is off our books next year (8.5m) and without Harrison (3m atm) we'll have plenty of space to put all that money onto re-signing Wilkerson. I can't believe we got Williams.

nyjets,34gsbn,Forty-Three,7,Fri May 1 03:48:02 2015 UTC,I cannot wait to see a Bowles blitz on most every down with all of this amazing young DLine talent. This season needs to start now.
nyjets,34gsbn,SpoonThief,1 point,Fri May 1 02:42:22 2015 UTC,"He won't need to blitz, but with the 1-1 mismatches created by Revis/Wilkerson/Richardson he will definitely have a free guy if he wants to send 5 after the QB, I just think he's going to realize there is no need to blitz the way he did before."
nyjets,34gsbn,walkerstepbackwalker,1 point,Fri May 1 19:27:36 2015 UTC,"I agree he won't need to, but I'd still like to see some crazy blitzes because we have plenty of personnel to throw at them, and a secondary that won't fuck up on almost every third down."

nyjets,34gtuu,yakoos,1 point,Fri May 1 02:54:55 2015 UTC,"He's not playing OLB, hes not the edge rusher that was needed like Fowler. Still he's a beast physically and that D-line got much better, completely worth the selection."
nyjets,34gtuu,loyloy84,6,Fri May 1 05:59:15 2015 UTC,"i know hes not an OLB, what I meant was he needs to be significantly better at DE than Beasley is at OLB for this to feel good since we have 2 great DEs and plenty of cap room to keep them"
nyjets,34gtuu,yakoos,1 point,Fri May 1 06:34:04 2015 UTC,"With the Revis contract and all the beefing up on the secondary, we can honestly afford to pay only one. Mo is the safe bet to go cause its his contract year and the pick is a like for like."
nyjets,34gtuu,loyloy84,1 point,Fri May 1 06:41:15 2015 UTC,"nothing at all should make you sad about this pick except the fact that the season doesnt start until september. He's a DE in a 3-4 and a DT in a 4-3 by his own words and even if they go Rich-Har-Wilk it is never a bad thing to rotate the best player in the draft through. Kevin White would have been OK, but you can take Strong/DGB in round 2 and look for a 1st round WR in a year or 2 when Marshall is gone and Decker on the way out."

nyjets,34gtuu,walkerstepbackwalker,1 point,Fri May 1 19:24:50 2015 UTC,I think that it means Mo moves on. Maybe not this year but still won't be a jet for life. Williams is great but I have a special appreciation for wilk (would rather trade Richardson for example).

With Mo, we're in a position to do some really unconventional things on defense (let's not forget that Revis and Cromartie are going to be holding down the pass game).  On the other hand, we could get some real value for Wilkerson and use that that to shore up the offense a bit.  I'd HATE to lose him, but if I got over Vilma, I can get over anything.  Fuck Mangini."

nyjets,34hb5i,TheHeartTreeSeesAll,10,Fri May 1 15:13:23 2015 UTC,"Yea. I get that concern but I didn't think drafting him means the end of Mo at all.  Harrison is not an every down player.  We are gonna run a great rotational defense that will be mostly 3-4 (where Williams, Sheldon and mo can play inside also) and sometimes 4-3 (with any sort of combo of  Williams Richardson Harrison wilkerson and coples)  All of these guys are gonna play valuable parts on our dline next year"
nyjets,34hb5i,a_r0z,8,Fri May 1 03:50:19 2015 UTC,Def considering what bowles did last season. Most fans here are just clueless about the actual game so they are mad cause they aren't football smart enough to understand it.

If Wilkerson walks, we have a cheap replacement. If he gets traded, that fine, we'd probably get a ton back for him. If not, we have depth at that position, which is great.

You are improving the teams greatest strength from last year and one that you ALREADY greatly improved in FA.  However this league is about offense and the QB.  Whether the Jets D is 1, 2, 3, or even 6 in 2015 it does not matter.  The teams goes no place with an offense in the 20's or worst which is where it has been the last 4 years [22, 25, 30, 25].  Where as the last 4 years we've had a D ranked 6, 11, 8 & 5.  Of the bottom 13 teams in offense last year only 1 made the playoffs, Arizona.  Of the top 7 defenses in the league last year 1, 2 & 3 made the playoffs because they all have QBs. 4- 7 did not because they don't.  Now we could not draft a QB so you had to go get an offensive playmaker.  I wanted Cooper, but when that didn't happen and he was available, White was absolutely the player to take."
nyjets,34hb5i,staiano,1 point,Fri May 1 14:41:15 2015 UTC,"to be fair we have Marshall and Decker. We can get depth at receiver later in the draft. Williams is a freak of a talent, it'd be like passing on Sapp again."

nyjets,34hb5i,-bangarang,1 point,Sat May 2 01:42:14 2015 UTC,"He went from having Peyton Manning throwing him the ball to Geno Smith, of course his numbers got worse. The Jets passed for significantly less yards than the Broncos in either of those two seasons, a more accurate comparison would be how much of a share of each team's passing yards Decker had. Saying he was ""made by Peyton"" implies he has no value to a team if he doesn't have PM as his quarterback, but a receiver who produced a near-1,000 yard season with sub-par quarterback play clearly has value.  Jesus Christ, I can't even believe I'm having to make this argument"
nyjets,34hb5i,Forty-Three,1 point,Sat May 2 19:38:34 2015 UTC,He didn't do shit in Denver before Peyton got there either.

So we were looking at having Mariota/Beasley/Fowler/Cooper/Scherff available and so BPA at that point fills a need for the Jets no matter what they get. I'm waiting for the rest of the draft unfolds to make my decision on how good of a pick it is.   If they do get rid of Wilk I would be upset, but at least they have a suitable replacement."
nyjets,34hb5i,Citizen_of_Atlantis,5,Fri May 1 03:47:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly. As much as it would suck to see Wilkerson go, if he does then we basically are taking someone who projects to be the same player but without an insane price tag and that's okay with me"
nyjets,34hb5i,MongoJazzy,-4,Fri May 1 03:53:14 2015 UTC,Except for in 5 years when Williams is up for a new deal and the market has naturally grown and his deal will be even more insane than Wilk's will be.
nyjets,34hb5i,blinkme123,3,Fri May 1 07:13:57 2015 UTC,So will the salary cap by then since it's a reflection of player salaries. Either way it will still be the same percentage of our cap regardless of what the number is and that's what's most important.
nyjets,34hb5i,tgrabowy717,3,Fri May 1 12:27:19 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I definitely didn't expect him to be there but since he was it's a no brainer in my mind.  This guy is an absolute stud.  I'd be sad if we traded Mo too but I really don't think this is a sign that that's soon to come.  Mac would be a terrible GM if he didn't at least listen to offers for anyone on the team.
nyjets,34hb5i,Shadune,1 point,Fri May 1 03:53:39 2015 UTC,I think more people are just worried/upset about the seemingly real possibility of trading Wilk because of this pick.

nyjets,34hywr,Futilemediocrity,4,Fri May 1 09:25:38 2015 UTC,"i really like geno smith as a player. i dont follow him as much as id like to, but how do you guys feel about him? or is fitzpatrick your starter week 1?"
nyjets,34hywr,xenonprime,4,Fri May 1 09:27:36 2015 UTC,"I think Geno is week 1 starter. He improved markedly at the end of the season when he had Harvin as another receiver. (I think his passer rating over the last 4 games was 98 or so) So hopefully with BMarsh and a healthy Decker he can keep improving.  Oh and I hope you guys have a good year, I love me some Tony Romo."
nyjets,34io87,ghostofoutkast,8,Fri May 1 14:07:20 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be shocked if we took Gregory with our second pick. BPA and the fact he slipped this far is ridiculous. I really want OL and then just stick until the 3rd but I couldn't get angry at Gregory in the 2nd. I think we stay where we are today in rd. 2 and 3 and take BOPA.
nyjets,34io87,the_furry_stoner,3,Fri May 1 14:42:04 2015 UTC,I'm sure I'm not the only one who wanted us to improve our offense but after last night I say fuck it. Let's go all in on improving whatever holes we have on defense(linebackers) and work on the offense next year.

Decker and Brick could become cap casualties next off season. Brick has a high cap hit but there is a lot of saving if cut, he might end up restructuring/taking a cut if his play doesn't get better. Decker's guaranteed money is up after this season and he could get cut to save cap as well."

nyjets,34ixov,JETStheBest,1 point,Fri May 1 17:05:26 2015 UTC,"As of right now Marshall is the best receiver. If Mac doesn't feel Decker is playing up to his contract, then I can totally see him getting cut. He isn't a game breaking WR."
nyjets,34ixov,Dacious96,3,Fri May 1 17:09:03 2015 UTC,"He still had nearly 1000 yards while working with a nagging hamstring injury the first half of the season. If he keeps that level of play up, I'd say he's living up to his contract."
nyjets,34ixov,matap821,1 point,Fri May 1 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"Hey listen I know man, but I am listing off reasons why he could be cut. In a perfect world we would keep all our current players and Geno would turn into a good QB. But we don't and sacrifices are made. For me, if it came down to keeping Wilkerson or Decker, I choose Wilkerson. Again my personal opinion which will have no actual input into these decisions."
nyjets,34ixov,Dacious96,1 point,Fri May 1 19:34:36 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but I think Brick will get cut before Decker, and (as much as I hate the thought) I'm not sure if Mangold will still be around by the time Decker's contract expires. Those are huge contracts for us."
nyjets,34ixov,matap821,1 point,Fri May 1 19:44:59 2015 UTC,"Brick, maybe if is play continues to decline. But I doubt Mangold. Mangold has been one of the best centers for the past decade and has been playing at a top tier level even today."
nyjets,34ixov,Dacious96,1 point,Fri May 1 19:51:47 2015 UTC,"I agree about Brick, but with Mangold 3-4 years is a loooong time for a lineman. I hope I'm wrong, though."

nyjets,34ixov,rvbcaboose1018,2,Fri May 1 19:15:48 2015 UTC,I would hate to see Brick go. He's been on the team for a while and really progressed a ton from where he started
nyjets,34ixov,jetsfan07,2,Fri May 1 17:18:22 2015 UTC,"People like to forget there will be nobody worth paying on our team for the forseeable future. If we extend Wilkerson for 5 years, it won't hurt us because we won't have a QB coming off a rookie contract for at least that long. Maybe people are scared of the idea of all that cap space being used, but why would we save it? Keep the home grown products if you can."
nyjets,34ixov,rvbcaboose1018,1 point,Fri May 1 17:12:42 2015 UTC,"We might start to feel it in 2016, and the worst of it will probably be 2017. But, honestly, I'm not too worried. We can restructure contracts, cut players, and on top of that, the cap is still expected to rise, meaning that we could gain an extra 10 million or in cap next year alone!"

He loses a lot of speed coming out of his breaks and his only real value in the NFL at this moment in his career is as a pure timing WR since the one thing he's actually good at is closing the space between him and a DB before breaking. On the one route where he actually looks like a high caliber receiver, the fades, he consistently gives up the boundary and runs right against it forcing the QB to make a perfect throw or completely miss him. There isn't enough on his tape to give me the idea that he has the potential to develop into more than your typical 75 overall madden receiver. He's going to need to be carried by an extremely well timed QB in his early years and if he's lucky he'll have some completely unprecedented development and get a second contract, but he's my pick of the highly considered WRs to be a teams depth receiver on his 5th year."

While people like to compare him to randy moss, his measurables put him at about a mike Evans, who as good of a pick as he was last year, is in no way randy moss.   If the misrepresentation of his measurables was his only knock he would have still been a top 10 pick, but he has been caught with drugs multiple times and has a assault charges under his belt. In his combine interview he came off as though he was trying to stifle discussions about his past, rather than own up to it, which to me felt very immature and worries me about if he really intends on changing the way he lives his life.   With all that said, I would prefer we looked at Jaelen strong. He lacks blazing speed but has a good build and knows how to use it to win contested catches by plucking the ball out of the air. Having him learn under Marshall could be the perfect scenario for him and us."

So the Jets and Redskins each finished 4-12 and they'll switch order each round  Notice that the Titans are selecting ahead of the Bucs (each 2-14) and the Raiders are now selecting ahead of the Jaguars (each 3-13)

nyjets,34hacj,NannigarCire,2,Fri May 1 05:12:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not totally done with Hundley so it's rough to really explain, but from what i have charted and broken down- Hundley passes on all the base traits required for a QB to succeed for me. He has the NFL arm required, he is able to sense pressure in the pocket, he doesn't overreact to pressure, he stays within the system when he can, and can do work outside of the system when he has to. He doesn't get rattled after how consistently he gets pressured either. On his college tape there's a lot of bad blocking, a lot of bad protection schemes that Hundley's not allowed to change (I don't think he's allowed to change play calls either at the line, but i'm not as sure about that), but he still consistently makes the correct pre-snap read (although i did see at least a few times where a team was able to disguise a play and he didn't notice) and throws the ball on time constantly. Despite playing in shotgun all the time, he has a really well timed drop back that's very fluid, and he's able to adjust his dropback when he sees something in the defense post-snap that wasn't what he saw pre-snap in order to take advantage of something. He's able to make all the small subtle pocket movements required to stay up in it, but they become hard to see on tape because of how often his line gets pushed around. His ball placement is also consistently away from the defenders and when asked to go through his progressions he does it pretty well. His throwing motion is very compact, and he's able to make throws with a player coming down on his face without sacrificing his timing, power, or anything. He's got a very quick snap release when he needs it as well.  That's what i've got from everything i've taken time to detail. I don't think Hundley's a year 1 starter though."
nyjets,34hacj,GreatNYBalls,2,Fri May 1 05:27:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks I appreciate the response. I haven't watched tons of Hundley, but I have seen a few of his games on draftbreakdown and you have encouraged me to watch more.    My thoughts are: He definitely has an NFL arm, but as we've seen with Geno - QB's need more than a strong arm. He might not get rattled, but he doesn't react to pressure well. I don't remember the exact statistic but he has a very bad completion % when throwing while scrambling/outside of the pocket. His footwork gets sloppy I see a strong tendency to run especially in the red zone.    I don't see him as a year 1 starter either, and due to the way the first round fell I wouldn't want him as our 2nd round pick. If he was somehow available in the third, I think the risk vs reward balance is there - but I highly doubt he makes it that far."
nyjets,34hacj,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri May 1 06:46:33 2015 UTC,"Neither arm is exceptionally strong, it's just strong enough to make it in the NFL which is a base requirement, he checks that off but so do many QBs of course, like you said. I have yet to see reacting to pressure being a consistent problem in what i've watched, for the most part he reacts exactly like how i've seen many other QBs in the NFL react. I can say that i've only seen one play so far where he reacted poorly to pressure and that involved declaring himself as a runner too early, but that's been a single time in a large large sample size since UCLA's line looks like it's been bribed half the time. I'm still not finished with him though."

nyjets,34hacj,Deigs,7,Fri May 1 03:33:42 2015 UTC,Grayson is maybe a 4th rounder at most
nyjets,34hacj,succulentjoint,-3,Fri May 1 05:11:03 2015 UTC,Our biggest need is at QB I'm not sure you pass on the #3 QB in the second round. But its ok if people disagree.
nyjets,34hacj,Truffles413,3,Fri May 1 12:52:41 2015 UTC,Just because he's the 3rd best QB in this draft doesn't mean he has a 2nd round grade.
nyjets,34hacj,John_YJKR,1 point,Fri May 1 13:01:09 2015 UTC,He didn't get much coverage so most think he's a late round pick. I don't know if you've noticed but most the fans on here are casual fucktards. God bless their hearts. I firmly believe he is tye 3rd best qb in this draft and a dark horse potential starter if he sits for a year. Two years would be better.
nyjets,34hacj,succulentjoint,1 point,Fri May 1 06:45:29 2015 UTC,'ppreciate ya. I just think at this point we are not gonna get a stud so we should try to address our biggest need and we should do it as a smart team would instead of throwing our rookies into the fire a la Geno. I really think if we develop Grayson he could be our guy  Edit: I'm cool with Strong too though
nyjets,34hacj,GillyMonsterz,1 point,Fri May 1 12:54:33 2015 UTC,If you don't think we can get a stud in the 2nd round...you don't understand draft history.

We can sign him to a big contract, trade him, hell they could just franchise him next year than let him walk after if they wanted. We have the ability to do all of those things.  The reason there has been so much talk about it is the  fact that there are so many possibilities. Only one guy really knows (even though I doubt he even knows right now) and he isn't saying anything."

nyjets,34irmx,staiano,1 point,Fri May 1 15:40:48 2015 UTC,To me it makes me think the organization does not think they can resign Mo and that stinks.  Not just to possibly lose Mo but also to lose a playmaker.

nyjets,34go7l,Sonsof_Manarchy,1 point,Fri May 1 00:50:23 2015 UTC,BEST OVERALL PLAYER IN THE DRAFT
nyjets,34go7l,johnnyricoo,1 point,Fri May 1 00:50:58 2015 UTC,I think honestly we move to a 4-3 Richardson and Williams on the end with Snacks and Wilkerson in the middle
nyjets,34go7l,kuyakew,1 point,Fri May 1 00:52:05 2015 UTC,You guys probably trade Wilkerson now
nyjets,34go7l,johnnyricoo,1 point,Fri May 1 01:00:04 2015 UTC,What happens to Coples?  And are our lbs fast enough for a 4-3?

nyjets,34go7l,Dubzoid,1 point,Fri May 1 01:01:07 2015 UTC,Not a long press conference. No way they would trade up into top 15 again so may as well answer some questions.
nyjets,34go7l,Itsascrnnam,1 point,Fri May 1 01:17:32 2015 UTC,our DL is going to be like prison rape and Brady's new name is gonna be Peaches
nyjets,34go7l,boredymcbored,1 point,Fri May 1 01:22:02 2015 UTC,Love the pick. Williams was the BPA by far and the fact they took the entire time means they tried to trade down and didn't find any offers worth taking.
nyjets,34go7l,boredymcbored,1 point,Fri May 1 01:02:24 2015 UTC,"Trade snacks away, 4-3 defense with Coples and Williams on the outside, and Rich and Wilks on the inside"

nyjets,34go7l,Sil5286,1 point,Fri May 1 01:11:39 2015 UTC,4-3...Richardson/Williams on outside with Snacks and Wilkerson on inside...Tom Brady sits when he pees
nyjets,34go7l,ppss112255,1 point,Fri May 1 01:12:54 2015 UTC,I think Richardson goes inside and Wilk goes outside
nyjets,34go7l,kuyakew,1 point,Fri May 1 01:17:41 2015 UTC,SO now we have a great ass defense... but can't offense. Hope we make moves to beef up offense tomorrow.

nyjets,34go7l,Davy_Grolton,1 point,Fri May 1 03:00:23 2015 UTC,"Maccagnan blew it. This doesn't mean that Wilkerson is safe, on the contrary he's setting the stage to make the case that he is obsolete.   They should have traded the pick. I wonder what offers he turned down. We'll never know unfortunately if there was something reasonable on the table, but using the full clock on the pick means he was trying to work something out."
nyjets,34go7l,woodchips24,3,Fri May 1 03:42:32 2015 UTC,I don't think you trade the pick for the sake of trading the pick if the offers are not worth it. Seeking a trade clearly we don't have much leverage... so take the BPA and worry about it later.
nyjets,34go7l,ben1204,1 point,Fri May 1 00:50:09 2015 UTC,We don't know what was offered so we'll never know for sure.

nyjets,34go7l,sk24iam,2,Fri May 1 00:54:29 2015 UTC,I actually happen to think he will be a great player for the Jets. But it was a missed opportunity to make a move that would help the team.

nyjets,34eukh,Killsitty,3,Thu Apr 30 19:40:58 2015 UTC,Because it was booked by something else. Either the New York Spring  Spectacular or Stage Door Three.  Edit: http://www.radiocity.com/calendar

The fact that our scouting staff was revamped by someone who has a background in scouting gives me confidence in drafting new talent.

nyjets,34eyah,doktrj21,4,Thu Apr 30 16:47:43 2015 UTC,"Most stuff I've read considers there to be 6 (Winston, Mariota, Williams, Fowler, Cooper, and White) top tier players in this draft. That's actually one thing I've read that could make a big difference if the Jets were to try to trade up, is that they are the only team trying to trade up that would still allow the team moving down to pick up one of the top 6 in the draft."

nyjets,34eyah,KIM_JONG_1Ls_DONKEY,2,Thu Apr 30 20:14:49 2015 UTC,I think most of us feel that this is actually gonna be one of the better drafts this team has ever had.
nyjets,34eyah,the_furry_stoner,2,Thu Apr 30 21:59:44 2015 UTC,"We all thought the same with Idzik. While I do have more faith this time around because Woody isn't up the GM and HC ass, I'm cautious. We're in the best position this team has been in since 2009, I think trading up for Sanchez was a mistake and I hope we don't ""reach"" for someone one person in the organization fell in love with.

nyjets,34heo4,BlackoutMurray,1 point,Fri May 1 05:06:50 2015 UTC,Where are you getting that he is terrible? He didn't play a full season and he definitely wasn't the reason the titans were bad. Had he played the full season his number projected him to be on pace with Carr despite playing with a much worse offensive line. He's still young and needs more tape to be fully evaluated but to say he isn't worth a 7th is ludicrous

nyjets,34heo4,Sir_Duke94,1 point,Fri May 1 12:04:21 2015 UTC,Just my opinion. I was personally shocked he was drafted that high and allowed to start. He's a project that isn't quite done cooking.
nyjets,34heo4,BlackoutMurray,1 point,Fri May 1 12:23:33 2015 UTC,You think being drafted in the 6th was high for him?

nyjets,34heo4,BlackoutMurray,1 point,Fri May 1 16:51:38 2015 UTC,Yes for the right price
nyjets,34heo4,JacobBo,0,Fri May 1 04:46:58 2015 UTC,Once I found out we picked Williams I had this thought...  Jets trading Wilkerson for Mettenberger and the Titans 2nd pick plus future picks. Maybe #1 or #2 next year.   It's a big IF on both rumors of teams inquiring about Wilk and Mettenberger's agent looking for a trade.
nyjets,34heo4,Pm_me_your_flipphone,2,Fri May 1 04:59:02 2015 UTC,"Jets could trade Mo and a 2015 7th rounder (#199 i think?) to the Titans for a 2016 1st rounder and Mettenberger. Or maybe Harrison for a the 2015 2nd rounder, 2016 2nd rounder, and Mett.   Either way, this goes out the window if we get Petty or Grayson or even Hundley. Can't have 4 QB's competing. 3 is enough."
nyjets,34gtn4,troddle,7,Fri May 1 01:00:26 2015 UTC,Bowles said we are still a 3-4 team. I imagine we will rotate mo Sheldon and Leonard in and out.
nyjets,34gtn4,ajn19,2,Fri May 1 01:49:12 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why no one gets this. Very few DL play every down. This gives the DLine depth, and while Williams probably was the closest thing to a sure thing, this helps us avoid what happened to our D Backs last year if someone goes down.  I highly doubt we move Mo, and if we did, I don't know that there's any commodity that could amount to what he means to the team and his sheer dominance at his position."
nyjets,34gtn4,murphy_is_my_copilot,1 point,Fri May 1 02:40:33 2015 UTC,"Harrison also played predominately on first and second down as a run stuffer and came out on third down where you usually had a Wilkerson/Richardson/Coples front. On any 4 down lineman pass rush fronts, I'd imagine you'd see Wilkerson/Richardson/Coples/Williams since Harrison isn't much of a pass rusher. I'd guess Coples/Wilkerson as ends and Williams and Richardson as tackles wreaking havoc on the inside."
nyjets,34gtn4,mnmnstrd,2,Fri May 1 06:05:20 2015 UTC,"Switch to 4-3. We went into this needing EDGE, now that we have Wiliams, we can just switch to 4-3 and it's like we picked an EDGE. Harrison and Coples switch in and out on passing vs run downs, and our line is insane. Harris takes the ILB, Davis takes the coverage linebacker role, and we put Lattimore at the rush linebacker."
nyjets,34gtn4,NannigarCire,2,Fri May 1 01:03:12 2015 UTC,"I'm really unfamiliar with a 4-3, what linebackers are on the field and what are their roles?"
nyjets,34gtn4,NannigarCire,2,Fri May 1 01:04:39 2015 UTC,"You get one linebacker as your ILB run thumper type, one rush linebacker and one coverage linebacker. Davis is the coverage backer/run support in our 4-3, Harris takes the main run thumper role, and Lattimore/that Vikings guy would take the pass rusher spot."
nyjets,34gtn4,tgrabowy717,1 point,Fri May 1 01:06:52 2015 UTC,I'm nervous.  My worst fear is we trade Wilkerson.  Hopefully we have a smooth transition into a 4-3.
nyjets,34gtn4,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri May 1 01:11:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think Williams or Wilkerson can play 4-3 End, they are both classic 5 techs. I'm also not sure about Harrison as a DT. Richardson seems a little more versatile, but I'd have serious doubts about how we'd transition to a 4-3. I"
nyjets,34gtn4,tgrabowy717,1 point,Fri May 1 02:18:41 2015 UTC,"Wilkerson would be inside with Williams, and Richardson and Coples would be on the edges. Wilkerson can potentially move around from time to time, although you'd realistically wnat him inside the majority of the time."
nyjets,34gtn4,NannigarCire,3,Fri May 1 02:27:06 2015 UTC,"That's the formation I would run too, but then you'd have arguably a top 5 NT riding the pine"
nyjets,34gtn4,viewless25,1 point,Fri May 1 02:28:49 2015 UTC,"Well you'd be mixing Harrison in for Coples every now and then depending on the down and distance. Keep Harrison in at DT with Wilkerson kicking outside on run downs and put Coples back at end with Wilkerson inside on pass downs. If we're afraid of a hurry up, then leave Harrison on the bench."
nyjets,34gtn4,kuyakew,1 point,Fri May 1 02:30:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite familiar with the transition between  a 3-4 NT to a 4-3 DT. Depends, we may need to sign off from Harrison, though i'd strongly prefer not to"
nyjets,34gtn4,GV22,1 point,Fri May 1 01:03:26 2015 UTC,Supposedly Williams is versitile enough to play DT or DE. Either way we allow all 4 of our guys to rotate throughout the game. I think that's the way to go. Obvious run down you throw Snacks in. Anything else and you have lots of options.
nyjets,34gtn4,Itsascrnnam,1 point,Fri May 1 01:42:49 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly enough, Harrison is in less than half of all defensive snaps. He could come in as a situational run stuffer while Williams is a more versatile player that can play most downs"
nyjets,34heep,GodEmperorBrian,1 point,Fri May 1 04:11:00 2015 UTC,This is great. Is there a list of the evaluators?
nyjets,34hgmv,OneManArmy77,18,Fri May 1 04:35:32 2015 UTC,"1) He is phenomenal athlete for his size with absurd strength that certainly is trancendent. I believe the other teams drafted need over best player prior to #6 for the most part hence the slight slide.  2) BPA, this is Mike McCagnan's philosophy and he is going to stick to it. I think this will push every player on that D-line to play their hardest and earn playing time.  3) If you watched Arizona film or watch the post draft interview you will see Todd Bowles certainly uses the 4-3. He uses whatever scheme is appropriate for the team/situation.  4) Not so sure why it is a red flag. Mo while probably remain with the Jets barring a trade that is far too good to pass up. Mike and Todd both laughed off the thought of wanting to get rid of Mo. He will play harder than ever for not only playing time but money."
nyjets,34hgmv,kidluke311,3,Fri May 1 04:56:36 2015 UTC,"You sir, I like you a lot."
nyjets,34hgmv,JYB16,4,Fri May 1 05:34:02 2015 UTC,"I don't hate it. I really like Beasley as a player and would have been perfectly happy with his selection. As Mac/Bowles mentioned in the press conference, they were looking to trade down but if the value didn't line up - it didn't line up.    I think picking Leonard bodes really well in terms of draft philosophy - even if that isn't abundantly clear yet. I don't believe for a moment that he will be relegated to a purely rotational role nor do I think this cements Mo's departure. Bowles is nothing if not a creative defensive strategist, he will certainly find ways to get Leonard in the game. A lot of people praised Rex for his scheme versatility especially with the DL, but I see Bowles' defense as being equally dynamic in nature. Seriously, watch the Cards D last year, at times its like a work of art. With that said, adding another 'versatile' lineman is definitely not a negative - even if I think it doesn't provide the most marginal benefit.    I also tend to disagree that it tanks Mo's value. The events seem independent to me. The Jets are not obligated to move Mo, and with a rising cap there is no reason to think they can't sign him. If a team offers a late second, we are not obligated to accept. It's kind of like a standardized test logic problem to me - Mo Wilk and Sheldon are fantastic players. The Jets drafted Leonard Williams. The next move doesn't have to be trade Mo.    I started rambling so I'll stop but overall, I don't think hating the pick is warranted - even if it isn't apparent yet."
nyjets,34hgmv,MattHarveysDip,5,Fri May 1 06:38:36 2015 UTC,"f he was that phenomenal, I can assure you that one of WAS, OAK or JAX would have taken him.   This is legitimately unreasonable logic to use. You're free to dislike the pick, but you're going to use other teams passing on players as the reason why a player isn't a phenomenal talent? You can't find any possible players in NFL history to debunk this theory?   He isnt a need... at all.   this is true and all but with Leonard an EDGE isn't a necessity now since we just move around the line in order to create an EDGE. Instead of just sitting at 3-4 on every down, we move to 4-3 on passing downs and Coples/Richardson sit on the EDGE with Wilkerson and Williams inside. It's almost like we drafted an EDGE, but with the upside that Williams could put on the weight to become a NT if we let Harrison walk (which we need to if we want to re-sign Wilkerson). This also responds to your 3rd point and 4th point.  We're more likely to move Harrison imo and we don't have to pay Wilkerson until next year, when Marshall and Harrison both leave our cap. We'll be able to re-sign him then (and we will, i hope)."
nyjets,34hgmv,NannigarCire,2,Fri May 1 06:50:40 2015 UTC,"Deep breaths, buddy. C'mon now. You done? good.    1) He isnt the greatest player in the draft like everyone thinks he is. Williams just does not have burst off the line or explosiveness or transcendent athleticism you would expect to find in a true consensus #1 pick. If he was that phenomenal, I can assure you that one of WAS, OAK or JAX would have taken him. Hell, Jax took a different defensive player over him. He didnt ""fall"" to us, we just took him at an ok position for him to go.   I mean, he may not be the best player, but he SHOULD be pretty good. WAS and OAK took team needs, and while JAX did take a D man, its an OLB, not a DE. Slight difference, it doesn't mean these teams think Williams is bad, its just that they think there were bigger and better players that fitted their specific needs. WAS going with Scherff had to of been determined a while ago, its a reach, but they probably needed it.       2) He isnt a need... at all. We were literally the team that needed him least. We have the #2 and 3 best 3-4 DEs already on our roster, why the fuck do we need another one? We had Vic Beasley, who I have ranked as my top player in the draft and a position of need, on the board, as well as a plethora of others and we pick the one guy thats a complete luxury pick. Hell, I wish we took Gurley over him.   I won't lie, you're right, he isn't a need, but with the draft mentality of best player available, you can't ignore him as a pick. Sure, we could have maybe gotten Vic B, but outside of that, picking to our needs would have been stretches, especially with Scherff on the board. What, we're gonna get Grayson with the #6? Or White, a WR that has a higher bust potential than the others? Only other pick we could have possibly made was Flowers, but again, stretching.      3) He will bump Mo off. There is no 4-3 for us, since Todd is not going to switch schemes. Even if there was, then we just made one of Coples or Harrison completely useless. In addition, none of the 3 DEs pass rush well enough to be a 4-3 DE. For our 3-4, beefing one of the 3 up to NT is about the same as switching them to OLB, and we know how well that goes (Coples). No, there is only 2 options: we either trade Mo (no sense in trading Richardson or Williams), or we rotate DEs. If we rotate DEs, then we waste Wilkerson's last year here for nothing and make the Williams pick even more of a luxury, hence why trading Mo is the only option.   Doesn't mean were bumping Mo off at all. Mac said we're not actively trading him. What the pick does do, is exactly what you point out in #4, it gives him less leverage. Mo wants an extension, fine. But with Williams, Harrison, and Richardson lining up, gotta think about what number comes across the table from Mo, or he is gone.   Who knows. Maybe we're not shipping Mo, but instead we're shipping Harrison? Or Richardson? Plus, whats to stop us from taking offers for either? Right now, the Jets didn't declare war on Mo, they declared open season on their fucking stacked D line, and GM's will start calling to see what they have to spend to get either of the 3.   In conclusion, the pick is less than 6 hours old, calm down, we got 5 more picks to go before we call the draft over, and probably 3 years before we can start calling the pick a bad one. So just enjoy the ride while we can."
nyjets,34hgmv,rvbcaboose1018,1 point,Fri May 1 05:10:05 2015 UTC,"WAS going with Scherff had to of been determined a while ago, its a reach, but they probably needed it.    That was a total need vs BPA pick.  The collective wisdom was saying Scherff was too high at #6.  #1 & #2 were obvious.  Perhaps Jax ""should"" have taken Williams, and I would have felt happier with Fowler.  Raiders went with an obvious quality pick with Cooper (and have you seen the Raider offense...???).  Yeah, thought Washington reached with Scherff, but it still can work out for them.  For the Jets, Beasley & White were the only peeps on the board comparable to Williams, but people seem to feel that Williams is HoF material.  Beasley's too small & White could be the next Hill (he won't be, but he may not meet his ""potential"").  So the Jets went BPA.  Check out the /r/NFL subject on Scherff.  No one even talked about him.  Everyone was wondering how low Williams could drop, and agonizing about their division rivals taking him."
nyjets,34hgmv,sameolejets,2,Fri May 1 10:01:26 2015 UTC,Why are people mad about Williams bumping mo off? Do you not want the team to be better? If he's better than mo then that's on mo.
nyjets,34hgmv,derpaderp1,2,Fri May 1 14:45:06 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem is it seems like a latteral move. Williams projects to be the player that Mo or Richardson are already. So yes it gives us flexability, but to me we essentially spent the 6th pick drafting a player we already have and didnt make the team any better."
nyjets,34hgmv,VinnyThePoo1297,1 point,Fri May 1 14:56:52 2015 UTC,But if mo is expecting a 4 or 5 year 100 mil contract it's a great move. He hasn't signed with the jets so far so I'm feeling like this is where it's heading. That kind of contract handicaps a team a ton
nyjets,34hgmv,derpaderp1,1 point,Fri May 1 15:26:22 2015 UTC,"See that's what upsets me even more. We used the 6th pick in the draft to not pay a player. Yes it allows us to move on from Mo and not have to replace him, but again then the team remains stagnant. At some point we're going to have to spend money and I'd rather spend it on proven talent like Mo and improve the team though the draft not use it as a means to replace a player we already have."
nyjets,34hgmv,VinnyThePoo1297,1 point,Fri May 1 15:34:55 2015 UTC,"But 1 player on the dline earning 20 mil or whatever a year does not have the same return as 3-4 other players who are improvements in other parts of the team.

nyjets,34hkmr,Original-jankster,3,Fri May 1 05:22:20 2015 UTC,"They play different positions really. Leonard has ~40 pounds on Clowney and is widely considered a 3-4 DE. Clowney is a prototype 4-3 DE or pass rushing OLB (like with the Texans). Part of the difference is Clowney is a better athlete. A 6'5'' 260 pounder who runs in the 4.5s is going to generate hype. Its just uncommon. The quarterbacks definitely helped in overshadowing Leonard, but 3-4 DE is also a less flashy position (unless you're JJ Watt). Leonard compares really well to Mo/Sheldon which is why there is some controversy over where we will play him. Overall, I would say that Clowney was a bit overhyped and Leonard's hype level was right on. If Clowney reaches his potential he can be just as much of a gamebreaker as JJ. If Leonard reaches his potential he can be just as much of a gamebreaker as Mo/Sheldon."
nyjets,34hkmr,MattHarveysDip,4,Fri May 1 06:19:39 2015 UTC,"Watt is much more similar to Wilk/Sheldon/Leonard than he is to Clowney. He's on another level, sure, but if we're talking about build, athleticism, etc. then that's the most apt comparison."
nyjets,34hkmr,McStrauss,1 point,Fri May 1 07:15:53 2015 UTC,"True - I was trying to refer to the ""hype"" surrounding them. I don't think any one is prophesying that Leonard will have the impact on a game that Watt does. With Clowney, that level of hype was there."
nyjets,34hkmr,MattHarveysDip,2,Fri May 1 07:21:16 2015 UTC,I get that ones a 43 DE and ones a 34 however looking at there college numbers:  Tackles: Williams 217 - Clowney 130  TFL:  35.5 - 47  Sack: 20 - 24  FF: 4 - 9  PDef: 7 - 7  INT: 2 - 0  If these guys were in the same draft class would there not be talks of who would go #1 or still Clowney only due to Texans needs?   My understanding is that Williams was two-gapping in college where Clowney was coming off the edge. When I think about the difficulty involved in playing two gaps it's amazing to see the numbers LW put up.

nyjets,34gwys,kenbrellfan,3,Fri May 1 01:30:16 2015 UTC,"Every team runs a mix of 3-4 and 4-3. We'll be using both, we can switch to 4-3 base though this year but if Williams puts on weight we can just stick him at nose in the 3-4 and let Harrison walk/trade Harrison this year. Williams would be a huge upgrade over Harrison because he can pass rush extremely well and is still a very good run defender. We do have the roster to do 4-3 effectively, either way we can't go wrong."
nyjets,34gwys,NannigarCire,2,Fri May 1 01:31:50 2015 UTC,"I know I'll probably get downvoted for this, but I think we should trade Mo. Harrison is an excellent NT that we can get for far cheaper than Mo, and our 3-4 would be just as good with Williams, Richardson and Harrison."
nyjets,34gwys,NannigarCire,2,Fri May 1 01:39:20 2015 UTC,"No promise that Harrison is gonna be cheap. problem is that whatever we pay him will likely be overpaid since he's not even able to be on the field on passing downs.

nyjets,34gwys,ThreeCranes,1 point,Fri May 1 01:36:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I think we could still trade him but do you think Williams has the weight to play nose tackel right away?  For comparison Williams is 303 lbs while Harrison is like 350.
nyjets,34gwys,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri May 1 01:40:52 2015 UTC,"Not right away, but he can put on. His body type can totally take on the weight."
nyjets,34gwys,ThreeCranes,1 point,Fri May 1 01:55:23 2015 UTC,"I guess, at first I didn't like the move but more and more its starting to make sense. A 3 down pass rushing NT would be great to have."
nyjets,34gwys,NannigarCire,2,Fri May 1 01:56:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah man. An elite pass rusher at NT would destroy teams. Geno Atkins was killing teams before when he was at the top of his game. Wilkerson and Richardson on the sides with Williams coming up the middle is one of the most destructive interior pressure situations any QB can deal with. I'm very excited about the potential of this pick, and i will say that even if Williams doesn't realize his full potential I think this was the right pick in a fairly weak class."
nyjets,34gwys,IamLeven,1 point,Fri May 1 01:59:27 2015 UTC,Atkins wasn't anything close to a NT.
nyjets,34gwys,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri May 1 02:29:48 2015 UTC,He played NT but was used as a pass rusher at the position.

nyjets,34hbll,Totally_PJ_Soles,2,Fri May 1 03:43:19 2015 UTC,I like DGB more but Mike apparently factors in character in his drafts so I doubt he becomes a Jet.
nyjets,34hbll,ThreeCranes,2,Fri May 1 03:45:26 2015 UTC,DGB!
nyjets,34hbll,FlightXXII,2,Fri May 1 03:56:23 2015 UTC,"I don't want the Jets to go anywhere near Strong. Strong is nowhere near the best available WR talent on the board, and his on field presence is so minimal and weak. If we want a WR and don't want one with character concerns, Tre McBride is where it's at. He's almost an exact clone of Cooper without the SEC tax."
nyjets,34hbll,NannigarCire,2,Fri May 1 04:15:07 2015 UTC,"The William and Mary guy? Isn't he pegged as a slot guy? And Strong has way better tape than McBride, and against better competition. Not to mention he blew up the combine."
nyjets,34hbll,woodchips24,2,Fri May 1 04:23:41 2015 UTC,"That's the guy, he can play anywhere. I think we can still get him in the 3rd though. I don't think Strong has better tape than a lot of WRs. His on field play is incredibly stiff, his breaks take a lot of his speed away from him, he has no YAC ability (except when he has a running start, but so does every WR in that situation), his hand technique is as inconsistent as Perriman's but he's also more willing to let the ball bounce into his chest. I just hate Strong in every way. The only time he ever looks good is on his fade routes, and even on those routes he has no sideline awareness.  Like, for me a WR's main role is to give the QB an easy target. Strong doesn't do that at all. He's going to need a QB to heavily carry him early on cause his only role in the NFL right now is as a pure timing WR."
nyjets,34hbll,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri May 1 04:26:58 2015 UTC,I'd rather go o line than receiver. But if we get a receiver I'd want a speed guy like Devin Smith or Tyler Lockett
nyjets,34fte0,vocalpoint107,8,Thu Apr 30 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"Absolutely yes. Fathering  a child with a murder victim isn't a crime, I feel bad for the guy. If we can get someone as talented as him for our line in the 3rd/4th I'm all over it. Sounds to me like teams are way overreacting over off-field concerns without doing their due diligence. The police have repeatedly gone out of their way to say he is not a suspect"
nyjets,34fte0,NotThe1UWereExpectin,2,Thu Apr 30 20:32:08 2015 UTC,I would take him in the 2nd and be overjoyed. He's my favorite OT in the draft.
nyjets,34fte0,CrimsonToaster,2,Thu Apr 30 21:33:41 2015 UTC,I like the idea of that but I feel like ESPN would just furthermore call us a circus which is getting old.
nyjets,34fte0,buymedinnerfirst,2,Thu Apr 30 20:20:59 2015 UTC,"2nd round, come to poppa!"
nyjets,34fte0,Rugger11,2,Thu Apr 30 21:01:47 2015 UTC,It depends on too many factors that we wouldn't know about unless we had access to private investigators who have investigated this situation.
nyjets,34fte0,MongoJazzy,2,Thu Apr 30 21:04:12 2015 UTC,The more I read about this story the weirder it seems. He isnt a suspect but his agent wanted him to be pulled from the draft. Yet Police still want to question him. I mean i think I would make this pick if we get a another 2nd round pick in a trade but this sure is a controversial topic.
nyjets,34fte0,RJSSUFER,0,Thu Apr 30 21:39:30 2015 UTC,"Love it. Lineman are nasty and dirty on bothsides. Twisting pulling punching spitting insulting is all allowed. Holding is called 2% of the time it happens, and only after the refs find their penalty target in the 2nd half. I want a mother fucker on the line. He should be nasty."
nyjets,34gzmi,JDandJets00,1 point,Fri May 1 01:54:03 2015 UTC,"to be Leonard to DT to be Damon-esque but with some pass rush capability, do you think this is a steal?   Yes and I will take back all of my pervious bitchy comments. That being said Damon Harrison had one of the best stories as a Jet since Wayne Chrebet it will be a shame to see him go before his prime."
nyjets,34gzmi,ThreeCranes,1 point,Fri May 1 02:03:35 2015 UTC,"Yes h definitely did. Sad stuff but we most likely can't afford to keep Wilk/Damon in the first place since they are both owed money in the next 1-2 years.   Think this is a sneaky genius move for the future, especially if we get a pick for Harrison, who cost us nothing in the first place"
nyjets,34gzmi,CatMother3000,1 point,Fri May 1 02:22:22 2015 UTC,"Leonard isn't even 20 years old. Saying that a kid that even drink is going to come in and dominate to the point to trade one of the ""sons"" just seems a little crazy. There are a lot of 6 overall picks that don't even work out. There just gonna let him learn from the ""sons"" and see some playing time. With Rex Harrison came off on 2nd and 3rd down, and wilk/Ritch moved to DT with couples/babin on the ends. I would see Williams coming in for Damon on 2nd and 3rd to play strong side with wilk over the center and ritcherson on the weak side, or move them around depending on situations and match ups."

nyjets,34gzmi,CatMother3000,1 point,Fri May 1 03:12:50 2015 UTC,My bad should have said not even 21. Thanks.
nyjets,34gzmi,Realistik84,0,Fri May 1 04:05:34 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree, I addressed my thoughts as a comment in the top reply here, but right now I'm thinking about draft/afterward strategy.   Given our current future cap situation, it's improbable we can afford to give Wilk/Damon long term deals simultaneously. I'm saying that this pick might be sneakily genius in that we have Sheldon/Williams on rookie contracts for the first couple years of Wilk's new contract, while also upgrading DT position, and at the same time giving us a better possible pick/cap/FA options in the future."
nyjets,34gz4y,VinnyThePoo1297,7,Fri May 1 01:49:26 2015 UTC,Wilkerson isn't going anywhere
nyjets,34gz4y,akaneel,7,Fri May 1 01:51:03 2015 UTC,"I wasn't to happy with the pick either my post histoy will show you that. However I'm warming up because of the positives.   1) We literally got the best player in the enitre draft.  2) Williams is 20 years old,he can't even buy vodka .  3) We could real in a lot for Wilkerson if it has to come to that  4) We could possibly try to convert Williams into a passrushing nose tackle."
nyjets,34gz4y,ThreeCranes,3,Fri May 1 02:12:44 2015 UTC,Trading Wilk is PURE SPECULATION. Everyone needs to drop it.
nyjets,34gz4y,kuyakew,3,Fri May 1 02:54:13 2015 UTC,"You draft the best player avl. Simple. If you have a WR rated say 10th and Williams rated 1/2, you DO NOT draft that WR because of need. You take the best player avl. Williams is so talented you can't pass him up."
nyjets,34gz4y,Capon3,2,Fri May 1 03:56:04 2015 UTC,"We are not trading Mo. Teams are coming to us about it, but don't think for a second Bowles is gonna let Mo go."
nyjets,34gz4y,TehFoote,1 point,Fri May 1 02:06:23 2015 UTC,I'm definitely disappointed in not addressing our need in linebacker. I was all sold on Beasley.
nyjets,34gz4y,Reckless_Vlad,1 point,Fri May 1 02:08:33 2015 UTC,Bowles was known for switching between 4-3 and 3-4 last season. He may have that in mind. Also we could rotate de out and stay dominant.
nyjets,34gz4y,John_YJKR,1 point,Fri May 1 02:33:30 2015 UTC,"I wanted Beasley -- but I'm ok with it. First, it was clearly a BPA pick which bodes well for the future of the organization. Second, Leonard seems like a great young player who will fit right in on our line. Third, scheme wise I think Bowles will often go DB heavy which means our DL must be strong at the point of attack. We're sacrificing weight on the backside, but more than making up for it in the front.  They didn't draft him in the first round to sit him on the bench. I'm still excited."
nyjets,34gz4y,MattHarveysDip,1 point,Fri May 1 02:39:12 2015 UTC,"The guy is a TREMENDOUS talent but at the end of the day, we are still left with the same amount of holes to fill. But at the same time, I suppose those players weren't worth the reach."

nyjets,34e2iy,TreSeven,19,Thu Apr 30 12:05:56 2015 UTC,"Kevin White or trade back. I'd prefer White though, I want the Jets to get in on an elite WR prospect a la OBJ, Mike Evans, Sammy Watkins, etc."
nyjets,34e2iy,succulentjoint,30,Thu Apr 30 12:14:48 2015 UTC,"White all day and twice on Thursday. Decker, Marshall, White, Kerley. yes please.  I love the Marshall pick up but he is 31 and is 8.1 million next year. White gives us the possibility of being able to cut him with no dead money and still have two top WR's if we want. It is a no brainer for me.  On a less logical side note: Keyshawn fucking Johnson, that is the last time we drafted a big name stud WR. You know how long ago that was. ER was the top show on TV and the fucking spice girls were running around telling everyone what they really really want.  Well I really really want a fucking WR."

nyjets,34e2iy,fredagostino,8,Thu Apr 30 16:18:10 2015 UTC,I'd take either Beasley or Scherff. I'd really love it if they got Scherff I feel like he's going to be an excellent player and he can play both tackle and gaurd. As for Beasley what he lacks in size he makes up for in explosiveness.
nyjets,34e2iy,RTepps,5,Thu Apr 30 12:46:04 2015 UTC,My answer as well.  Either that or trade down. This talent pool seems a bit overrated to me...

nyjets,34e2iy,derpaderp1,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:25:49 2015 UTC,RB in the first round is always a bad idea.
nyjets,34e2iy,reifdog,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:28:13 2015 UTC,Why?
nyjets,34e2iy,derpaderp1,0,Thu Apr 30 21:29:06 2015 UTC,"Not only is RB debatably the least-important position on the offense, it has the shortest shelf life.   It gets worse when considering the draft - historically, 1st-round RBs have performed just as well as 2nd- and 3rd-rounders. No point in taking one so early."
nyjets,34e2iy,reifdog,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:36:53 2015 UTC,"Running backs aren't worthless. That's a dumb position to take. If lynch, Murray, ap, Charles, shady etc are sitting in the first round you're going to let them sit? If weedy running back was equally as good every team would have an impact back. They don't."
nyjets,34e2iy,derpaderp1,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:41:27 2015 UTC,"I never said they were worthless. If you're guaranteed a superstar running back, no reason not to go for it. However, the draft is almost always a crapshoot (see Richardson, Trent - top ""can't-miss RB prospect in his draft), and it's risky to go RB in the first round when, again, historically, 1st-round RBs have performed just as well as 2nd- and 3rd-rounders."
nyjets,34e2iy,reifdog,-1,Thu Apr 30 21:47:40 2015 UTC,"Except you can say that about literally any position ever. And using trich as an example is about as valid as saying don't take qbs first round because Ryan leaf.   God I hope jets offices are smarter than you  Edit: also historically is a dumb argument too. More people outside of a first round than inside. Do you even stats, bro?"
nyjets,34e2iy,derpaderp1,0,Thu Apr 30 21:50:17 2015 UTC,"Lol. I don't think you understand my argument. A running back selected in the first round has a roughly equal expected value to one selected in the third round.   Do you even english, bro?"

nyjets,34e2iy,B_H_Dweller,-2,Thu Apr 30 14:40:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree. With the 2 best QBs as well as the best defensive players still left, you can seriously get a lot in return by trading down. Especially considering that the Bears (who pick right after us) can easily justify taking all of these players and would be ecstatic if any of those guys dropped to them.

nyjets,34c8wp,TheGuardian8,2,Thu Apr 30 03:04:17 2015 UTC,"Well it depends on who it is. If we're talking the Jags' next two first rounders, they're still probably near the bottom of the draft again."

nyjets,34f9s4,will1119,3,Thu Apr 30 17:44:01 2015 UTC,I hate when people make claims like this. No one knows anything about how these prospects will end up playing. How could you possibly say with confidence it'd be a bad move? Same goes for calling it a good move. You can't evaluate a draft day trade until at least 2 or 3 years down the road.
nyjets,34f9s4,ThreeCranes,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:48:34 2015 UTC,We would have to give him a good number of  draft/depth picks to move up to the number 2 spot. We still havent fully recovered from Tannebaum dealing away so many picks.
nyjets,34f9s4,McStrauss,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:56:00 2015 UTC,Dealing picks wasn't what killed tannenbaum. It was dealing out massive contracts to veterans with the hope of winning a Super Bowl in that 2009-2011 window that did us in. Don't forget that he drafted Revis and Wilkerson.
nyjets,34f9s4,ThreeCranes,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:08:01 2015 UTC,"It was a mix of both. I'm not trying to get on the ""Tannebaum is the worst GM ever"" circlejerk but he did screw up in that regard."
nyjets,34f9s4,will1119,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:11:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that's an assumption based argument. You're assuming that those lost picks would turn into something. Each pick has a certain value that represents what type of player a team thinks they can get with that pick. Higher picks are more valuable because you're far more likely to get a player in the decent-impactful range. While our previous GMs have not been great we're really not in a position where we need to do anything in this draft. All we need to do (and Mac recognizes this) is get as much value out of our picks as possible. If a trade (either up or down) comes along where Mac believes he can get more value he will do it."

nyjets,34f9s4,cytokine7,2,Thu Apr 30 17:38:55 2015 UTC,"We won't like it at first. But Mo, Milliner and the 6th for a potential franchise QB is a good deal."
nyjets,34f9s4,azzjuice,3,Thu Apr 30 17:45:39 2015 UTC,"I think we'd all be ok with letting Milliner go, but losing Mo for Mariota just seems like way too much of a Mike Tannenbaum aka degenerate gambler move. This is coming from someone who would very much like to see Mariota in green and white."
nyjets,34f9s4,cytokine7,0,Thu Apr 30 17:50:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd like to stay put. But if a deal were to go down Mo and the 6th versus 2 firsts and a second is worth debating.
nyjets,34f9s4,azzjuice,0,Thu Apr 30 17:53:11 2015 UTC,"Even better, I'd really like to trade down. There are a lot of talented players in this draft, and it's looking like a pretty deep first round."

He's a little too small and I just don't see him making it big in the NFL. Think Barkevious Mingo from last year. Plus, Clemson makes awesome college defensive ends but they don't seem to pan out in the NFL, although I think Beasley will be the best of the ones that have come out in recent memory."

How would you like to have the next Pro Bowl RB?   Having that kind of a player would be HUGE for this team.   I think there are safer choices but Gurley might be the best choice.  If you look back at old drafts you see that there are between 9-15 Pro Bowl picks in every first round.  Is Gurley the next PB RB?  I think he could be that guy.

nyjets,34arpo,RJSSUFER,-7,Thu Apr 30 13:28:59 2015 UTC,Sweet. Cheap and quality player for this year. Maybe we could flip him for a 2nd rounder in this draft and keep Mo.
nyjets,34arpo,blinkme123,4,Wed Apr 29 19:01:05 2015 UTC,Are you trolling?
nyjets,34arpo,RJSSUFER,-3,Wed Apr 29 19:35:03 2015 UTC,"No why? If the reason we would trade Mo is because of his impending free agency and not wanting to pay too many guys, why wouldnt we trade snacks now, when he is cheap and has value, and have more options next year to resign Mo?"
nyjets,34arpo,blinkme123,7,Wed Apr 29 19:39:01 2015 UTC,"Because there's no suggestion that we will/want to/need to trade Mo. Mo's new deal is not affected by cap space this year. We have a lot of cap flexibility going forward because of the way that MacDaddy has structured his FA contracts. The cap is estimated to increase by another $8-$10M next year. Other teams calling about him means absolutely nothing. That phone conversation could go like this:      Team X GM: Hi Mike, we are interested in trading for Muhammad Wilkerson. What's the price gonna be to get him? MacDaddy: Sorry, we're not interested in trading Mo. TTYL."
nyjets,34arpo,McStrauss,4,Wed Apr 29 19:52:12 2015 UTC,"I just don't see Harrison having significant trade value due to the position he plays. There won't be many teams interested in trading for him, and those who are probably wouldn't be interested in giving up a whole lot for him. He's worth much more to us than any haul we could get in a trade for him.  Also, comparing Snacks to Wilkerson in terms of contract is just absurd. Mo will be getting significantly more than Harrison, so I fail to see how they're related."
nyjets,34arpo,RJSSUFER,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:52:56 2015 UTC,"Well Cimini said that Harrison is headed for a big pay day. He wont get 15-20 million a year like Wilkerson, but he could easily get 8-12 million. Thats still a large amount to lock into one position."

nyjets,34biqb,JaceGhost,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:14:19 2015 UTC,"You're just going to have to prove it, Geno. To date, you've yet to prove anything other than not being able to play consistent ball."
nyjets,34biqb,BigNuke43,4,Wed Apr 29 22:21:36 2015 UTC,"He did prove how much better he played with an actual WR corps. When the depth chart went from Decker, Kerley, and Nelson to Harvin, Decker, and Kerley, Geno's passer rating went from 58.53 to 91.85. Over the final six games, he had 6 TDs and 3 INTS, with no multi-interception games.  Maybe all he needed was three actual WRs instead of two."
nyjets,34biqb,otomotopia,0,Wed Apr 29 22:28:28 2015 UTC,"That 6-3 TD-INT ratio sounds 'ok' when you don't take into context that half of those TDs were thrown in the last game against Miami - a team that was already out of the playoffs and packed it in. Otherwise, he only had one game where he didn't throw a pick, and only one game (the same game) where he had more TDs than INTs.  I'm not sure where you're finding that rating stat from, because I can't find it. Looking at his QBR, however, tells a completely different story. He had a solid QBR for the final game of the season - a 94.4 - but the rest of the games it was horrible to mediocre (5 of his last 6: 27.6, 7.4, 48.9, 28.5, 49.1).  So, no, he hasn't proven anything. Maybe to somebody who is accepting of mediocrity he proved something, but not to anyone who has higher standards. Now, I think if we can fix up the OL to give better pass pro, and add a WR like Cooper, I think Geno could play better under those circumstances. But, those things still won't fix his awful decision-making, bad awareness, and sub-par accuracy."
nyjets,34biqb,BigNuke43,3,Wed Apr 29 22:42:09 2015 UTC,"Why are you using QBR? That's ESPN's terrible pseudo RAT, right?  Here's another stat for you, he increased his 56.22% completion percentage to a 65.67%."
nyjets,34biqb,otomotopia,0,Wed Apr 29 22:57:11 2015 UTC,"Show me that stat without game 16 - a game that was a complete anomaly - where he had 80% cmp%. I'll wait here.  Oh, and you know what might help that increased completion percentage? The fact that his attempts went DOWN during that span."
nyjets,34biqb,BigNuke43,3,Wed Apr 29 23:15:04 2015 UTC,"it is always easy to say pull out someone best game and they won't look as good as their stats say. do the same thing for Fitzpatrick. if you take away his 6td game then his QB rating drops 8 points,  his TD int ratio drops,  and his ""great season"" becomes a career average season."
nyjets,34biqb,CosmicWy,2,Thu Apr 30 00:30:40 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but the reason you do that is because when the vast majority of his good stats over that span come from THAT game, how in the world can you then argue that the entire span itself was good as opposed to only the single game being good? That's why you pull out anomalies. It's not about trying to cherry pick stats, it's about finding the typical performance.   If I went out and threw 10 TDs and only 1 INT over the course of 2 games, but those 10 TDs only came from one of the games, would you say that I had a good 2-game stretch? No, you'd say I had a good game. That's the point I'm making. Looking deeper - past overall stats - if you take away an absolute anomaly of a game (no, Geno Smith does not typically throw 3 TDs, 0 INTs, 358 YDS, and 80.0 CMP% for a 158.3 rating), you'll see that the majority of his games during that stretch weren't all that great."
nyjets,34biqb,BigNuke43,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:49:46 2015 UTC,"this is true,  but he did have a group of games with positive metrics regardless of the TDs.   a third year qb in a better system with better players can change a lot. this is why I hope we brought in Fitz!  to try out geno one more time for a quarter of the season and let's see if that step is taken.   he has shown he can be an above average qb."
nyjets,34biqb,CosmicWy,2,Thu Apr 30 01:19:30 2015 UTC,"I actually averaged all his throws and completions over the period with Harvin vs the period without.   Without Harvin: 233 attempts, 56.22% completions over 8 games.  With Harvin: 134 attempts, 65.67% completions over 6 games.   He averaged only 5 fewer pass attempts per game, and still increased his completion percentage by around 10%. 130+ attempts is easily a large enough sample size to show that he was much better with Harvin on the team than without.  And it makes sense, too. The extra WR talent spread the field, meaning coverage couldn't be as tight on the top two talents. The drop off in talent between the WR 2 and 3 was much smaller when Harvin joined as well. I'd much rather have Kerley as my WR3 than Nelson, and I know that Kerley does better against nickle corners than Nelson. When he does better, Geno has larger windows, which means he doesn't have to force as many throws that he can't make consistently."
nyjets,34biqb,otomotopia,0,Wed Apr 29 23:31:28 2015 UTC,"Of course it helps, but what I'm saying is that Geno wasn't this incredibly improved QB with Harvin. Aside from that anomaly of a game at the end of the year, he was still pedestrian at best, and not at all this ""changed QB"".  Also, you do understand that lower attempts can easily lead to higher cmp%, right? Look at these two games.   Vs DET: 17/33 for 51.5% Vs NE: 17/27 for 63.0%   So, even though it's only 6 fewer passes, it boosts his percentage by over 10%. Therefore, if someone wants to argue that having another receiver led to his higher completion percentage, I can easily argue that throwing less is the cause.   Essentially, we're just arguing cause. You argue that he had another weapon, I argue that he had less opportunities to fail. Regardless, the best we can get is a stalemate because Geno still has to prove himself. And, no, barely throwing more TDs than INTs isn't proving yourself."
nyjets,34biqb,BigNuke43,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:36:42 2015 UTC,"Also, you do understand that lower attempts can easily lead to higher cmp%, right? Look at these two games.   What? The amount of attempts have nothing to do with it. The fact that he did not complete any of the extra 6 passes is the reason. If you complete 1 out of every 2 passes you throw you will have a 50% completion rating whether you throw 10 passes of 100.  If he would have completed even 3 of those extra 6 passes he would have had a completion rating of 60.6. Which is the whole reason people don't look at percentages like that with such small sample sizes.  Also as he said he had a 65.6 completion rating with Harvin and that is not including the Dolphin game since Harvin was not playing."
nyjets,34biqb,games456,-1,Thu Apr 30 13:17:39 2015 UTC,"lmao! this is absolutely laughable oh man. he's an awful qb, makes terrible decisions with the football and has shown no growth over the two year span."

nyjets,34fo1s,John_YJKR,6,Thu Apr 30 22:23:53 2015 UTC,"If we played those games our hardest and lost, I would have absolutely zero problem with it. However if you are talking about throwing those two games to get picks, that's when we have issues. Integrity and all that aside, that is a dangerous train of thought. Where do you draw the line? Sure, you can draw it one year, but what about the next year or the one after? The precedent was already set that it is ok to do that, so what if we throw just one more game. That line gets pushed very easy."
nyjets,34fo1s,RJSSUFER,-1,Thu Apr 30 21:05:34 2015 UTC,my argument is the season was lost anyway it didn't prove anything by winning. Rex was going to be fired regardless at seasons end so you were getting a culture change anywau
nyjets,34fo1s,NYJETSfaninNE,4,Thu Apr 30 21:33:39 2015 UTC,"You are only looking at this from a fan perspective.  Players cannot throw a game, it negatively impacts their statistics during contract negotiations.  You will never see any player throw a game, they may not give 100% out there like last year with the Jets but never will a player risk their own money to throw a game."
nyjets,34fo1s,John_YJKR,5,Thu Apr 30 22:23:24 2015 UTC,Let's just keep losing every game for the next 10 years and get the first pick every time. We will build an amazing team. These posts make me sick. Get the fuck out. Worst fans ever.

nyjets,34fo1s,John_YJKR,0,Thu Apr 30 23:27:51 2015 UTC,so the season was lost by that point what did you gain by winning those games? if we were fighting for a playoff spot I'd agree with you. we gained not a thing by winning those games so you're argument is pointless
nyjets,34fo1s,Shrimpola_Cola,0,Thu Apr 30 21:32:36 2015 UTC,You claiming to be a fan is pointless cause you exposed yourself as a fraud. Losing on purpose is cheating.

nyjets,34bhhx,jrg114,3,Wed Apr 29 21:57:27 2015 UTC,He posted 962 yards and 5 TDs in 13.5 games where are you getting that he wasn't very good as our top receiver? If he's full healthy he gets 1100+ yards and 6 TDs which nets him as a top 15-20 receiver

nyjets,34amvh,matap821,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:54:27 2015 UTC,"I'm beginning to think more and more that for those of us that are pining for Amari, we should be more worried about the 5 slot than Oakland. Reggie McKenzie is a GB guy, they never take receivers that high, and if Oakland is sitting there with Cooper and Leonard Williams on the board I have a hard time believing Del Rio wouldn't be bashing his head against the table for a dominant D-tackle that just screams old-school Raiders football.   Washington, on the other hand, could look at Cooper and add him to a receiving core that's already pretty solid, or as a team that really wants to trade out. They could offer the pick to a Houston or San Fran or Miami that would be willing to leap up for a potential no. 1 recevier.   That being said.....I want Amari really bad, I feel like he and Kerley would be outstanding running alongside Marshall and Decker. BUT, Mikey Mac would probably want to trade out for a team willing to push the farm to get a swing at Amari."
nyjets,34amvh,Kevin_Jarboe,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:20:36 2015 UTC,Cooper is ideal for me Fowler Jr is 2nd option White is 3rd option Trade down land Scherff and DGB in 2nd is also good.

So how far would we really be trading down where we can comfortably get him. I just want Scherff at 6. Kid's a beast. With Mangold and Brick, we've seen how huge a top notch lineman can be.

Even if Geno improves so much this year that the Jets decide to extend him long-term, they would still be able to do so relatively inexpensively because of his past two years. Additionally, the Jets have 10m in cap room left for this year and the cap will be going up again next year. Finally, Mo is the only high value 2016 UFA on the roster. So basically, there is no reason to think the Jets can't keep both Mo and Shel without putting themselves into a bad cap situation."

nyjets,349ou9,dumbego,24,Wed Apr 29 14:02:21 2015 UTC,"“That’s the way he is, I guess,” Amaro said of the now-Bills coach, via Brian Costello of the New York Post.  “To be honest with you, I really wasn’t worried about it,” Amaro said. “I had no intention of attacking anybody, especially Rex. I have the utmost respect for the guy. He gave me a chance to play in this league before anybody else. That’s an everlasting thank you to him. . . .  “It just feels like he’s [new coach Todd Bowles] a lot more intact. It feels like he’s ready to go as a first-year guy.

nyjets,349ou9,MongoJazzy,-1,Wed Apr 29 20:47:55 2015 UTC,"Really you think the Bills are going to be lousy under Ryan huh?  I totally disagree.  but we shall see who is correct.  Last season Rex had terrible personnel - feel free to blame poor personnel on the HC and not the GM if that works for you.  Rex is a good HC - he has already shown that.  Which is why he was unemployed for about an hour after Woody fired him.  Anybody who ""hates"" a HC that took his franchise to 2 back to back AFCGs - is pretty much a moron."
nyjets,349ou9,MongoJazzy,3,Thu Apr 30 00:20:28 2015 UTC,"If RR is such a great coach, why were the Bills and Falcons the only ones with interest? Why would he take the Bills job over the Falcons with a top 10 QB? Because the Falcons wanted the unknown Dan Quinn over this allegedly good HC."
nyjets,349ou9,MongoJazzy,0,Thu Apr 30 01:40:17 2015 UTC,Who knows?  6 open slots 2 teams (33% chose to pursue Ryan).  The Bills moved very quickly to lock him up.  Rex took the Bills job b/c the Bills aggressively moved to sign him to a 5.5M/yr contract and b/c its a great opportunity.  Ryan opted not to wait on ATL to make a decision.  Rex wasn't available by the time the Falcons got around to offering Quinn.  Who cares?

On top of that Rex was immediately in a position to accept a great job offer w/a good team for even more $$ and control than he had in NY.  What should he have done?

nyjets,34dgv3,CosmicWy,1 point,Thu Apr 30 08:16:36 2015 UTC,"it will be a long time before a team is dopey enough to make the RG3 trade again.  usually, it takes a decade for every team to realize what a terrible mistake it will turn out to be."
nyjets,34dgv3,viewless25,3,Thu Apr 30 12:31:23 2015 UTC,"There's a disproportionate gap in value from trading up to the top 5 to sitting at 6 for a pick. Also, Mariota is more valuable to us than most teams, so there isn't much fault in taking him at 6"
nyjets,34dgv3,KingMalcolm,1 point,Thu Apr 30 07:45:41 2015 UTC,if Mariota is there at six (which he won't be) you have to take him or trade the pick for a kings ransom.
nyjets,34b3zr,DoctorTurkTurkleton,5,Wed Apr 29 19:07:10 2015 UTC,"If he's there, explore the trade-out options for sure. Chicago will likely jump at him if we don't, so there have to be feelers out there willing to leapfrog the Bears. Hell, maybe the Bears would want to assure that they can get him and swap picks with us along with netting us a 4th/5th.   If no offers blow us away, I say we take him. Why not? IMO he's the best player in the draft, and even though he's an asset at a position where we're currently strongest, wouldn't you love to see what Bowles could do with a rotation of Coples, Mo, Sheldon and Snacks across the D-Line?   Adding Leonard wouldn't mean the end of Mo, either. We'd have him on a rookie contract and we could still afford to pay Mo what he deserves and have leonard take over for Snacks when he gets his due in 2016."
nyjets,34b3zr,Kevin_Jarboe,3,Wed Apr 29 19:14:50 2015 UTC,"Williams would not be taking over for Snacks. Definitely not. Hell, the guy is smaller than Wilk and only a few pounds heavier than Sheldon. He'd play DE in our system and would serve little purpose outside of being a depth player on our team unless we trade away Sheldon or Mo. That doesn't sound like very good value for a top 10 draft pick to me."
nyjets,34b3zr,McStrauss,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:56:48 2015 UTC,Will Williams be able to play the nose? I don't think he's big enough to hold up in there. He's almost 50 pounds lighter than Snacks.

Free Agency has been a non-starter recently for QBs, with the team locking up their guys early, and average or above average guys like cutler and Flacco getting 20 mil+. QBs have been a minefield after the first round in the past 15 years with 2 outliers, Wilson and Brady, and we have a shot at getting a 2nd year first round pick at QB for the cheap. Why isnt this a good option? Are we gonna be stuck with Geno Smith/Fitzpatrick/Ex-Backup TBA in the future forever? I sure hope the jets arent picking in the top 10 in the next year or two, so they wont be able to get a QB that way. QB is by far the most important position, and we are just not making moves to actually find a great one, or even an above average one."
nyjets,34b5ne,the_furry_stoner,3,Wed Apr 29 19:44:48 2015 UTC,"It's not so much the idea of trading for him. Its giving up a third. The Browns are in a buyers market for Manziel. A conditional 6th or 7th at most is what I'd give. Personally, I like it. If the price is right we should do it. I think Bowles can keep him in line."

We have a three year window if all of our free agent pickups are anything to go by, a rookie quarterback would be counter productive to the way every free agent contract was handled.  We're better off plugging holes based around the team we've currently assembled and not wasting a premium pick on someone who may not make an impact for years if ever."
nyjets,34as5n,CoMaBlaCK,2,Wed Apr 29 17:57:58 2015 UTC,"Also, I'm not saying I'd be thrilled about the above scenario, I just think it would take care of the OLB issue and possibly the QB issue by next year.  That would be a successful draft IMO"

nyjets,34as5n,RJSSUFER,0,Wed Apr 29 18:01:02 2015 UTC,"We've got a decent veteran quarterback who is familiar and played his best football in our current system and the young can't miss quarterback of the draft 3 years ago.  If Geno turns the corner we already have our guy on the roster, if he doesn't we have a vet that's more than capable of running our offense and we can focus on immediate impact players in tomorrow's draft.  Your scenario with trading all of our picks for two prospects would be my worst nightmare."

It is nearly impossible to get a QB in free agency without overpaying guys like Flacco and Cutler, and great QBs are really only found in the first round outside of 2 outliers, Brady and Wilson. I sure hope we arent in the top of the draft in a position to get a QB in the next couple of years. Why isnt this the best time to solve the position?"
nyjets,34as5n,matts77,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:06:28 2015 UTC,Next years QB draft is way deeper. Shit next year we could draft 2 QBs if we wanted and let geno walk and just foster fitzy and two rookies. We don't need to draft our whole future this season.

nyjets,34as5n,NannigarCire,2,Wed Apr 29 20:59:32 2015 UTC,"Brees was 32nd overall, a first rounder if a year later. Favre was 33rd."
nyjets,34as5n,Shrimpola_Cola,0,Wed Apr 29 22:26:51 2015 UTC,"Cause Mariota isn't a solution, he's no less of a gamble than any of the later QBs in this draft. It's not like he's ready to come in and play, and it's not like we know that he'll ever come in and play well. If you want to take a chance of fixing the QB position there's many other prospects in this years draft that you can draft, comfortably sit without having any pressure of starting them, and possibly get just as good of a player out of. Hundley, Bonner, Petty, Grayson. I'm all aboard the Hundley train, personally. Mariota on his own merits isn't realistically worth a first rounder, he's just a QB who's going to get overdrafted because of the class."
nyjets,34as5n,RJSSUFER,2,Wed Apr 29 19:17:00 2015 UTC,"I understand where you are coming from but I disagree. The projection models and the scouts are in agreement on Mariota, that he is a top level prospect. Rare that both the math and the scouts agree, the last time was RG3 and Luck."

No one believed it would be a 2nd rounder because that would be ridiculous. After all is said and done you guys got off mad easy because not only did woody tamper before the end of the season...But right when free agency started you had Revis signed up within a days, which only means your organization was contacting him before free agency started, which is another tampering charge. As a patriots fan...i wish your team all the best, mostly cause your gonna need it since you spent about 145 million in free agency this year and still don't have a quarterback, which i guess your organization doesn't know is the most important position in football."

We trade revis, get a 1st and he is released the next year. Mo may not be released in 2 years, but he is probably headed toward 15-20 mil a year in his new contract for 2016. Maybe even earlier with this holdout."
nyjets,345ma8,RJSSUFER,2,Wed Apr 29 04:05:08 2015 UTC,This isnt the same as the revis situation a few years ago. The cap situation is no longer the disaster it was when tannebaum left. Wilkerson has emerged as our best player in that time. He is only 25 years old and a team leader. He also is not coming off an major injury the way Revis was. The Jets are not actively shopping him the way they were with Revis. Maccagnan has said before the Jets are currently focused on the draft and will negotiate a contract extention after thats over. It would be absolutely nuts to trade mo.

nyjets,345ma8,Realistik84,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:32:48 2015 UTC,"While I really like Rivers, he's 33. He'd only really be playing for a couple years before retiring. We could have Wilkerson for the next decade if they wanted. I'd rather get a young QB and potentially have that one for the next decade instead of another aging vet.  Besides the whole reason Rivers wants out of the Chargers is he doesn't want to move to a big city, there is no way he'd go to the Jets."
nyjets,345ma8,Forty-Three,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:28:39 2015 UTC,I agree it won't happen -  but 33 isn't exactly old for a QB and Rivers was arguably the MVP through the first half of the season last year.  We're talking about an elite QB who gives us a legit shot to make a playoff run. It's just not close. The team would be at least 2 or 3 wins better if you exchange Rivers for Wilkerson.

nyjets,345ma8,Ducci7799,3,Tue Apr 28 15:03:18 2015 UTC,"I want to keep Mo as much as the next guy, hands down favorite player on the team, great character, homegrown, everything. And before everyone starts bashing on me about being potentially okay with this move, think about if the Titans are the possible team that's interested.  We get the two and the six pick in this draft.  We are able to then pick Leonard Williams, and then move Sheldon over to Mo's.  I don't think that switch would be awful to be honest, and Williams has a shot to be great, even better than Wilkerson.  Do I want this to happen?  Absolutely not.  Will it be awful for the team?  Not necessarily, as we get a player that's potentially better than Wilkerson, as well as saving around 12M a year.  I don't want this to happen.  Not at all."
nyjets,345ma8,MS525,2,Tue Apr 28 14:57:51 2015 UTC,"Wilkerson is proven. Williams is not. There is also nothing showing that he can be better than Wilkerson, who is one of the top players at his position. You don't trade away your 25 year old, homegrown, star player for an unproven rookie who might have a chance to be as good as your Vet. It is not like this guy is the second coming of Watt."

nyjets,345ma8,RJSSUFER,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:03:32 2015 UTC,Doubt Mo gets that much. He's due for a big payday but not that big. And one guy is one of the top D-Linemen in the league and the other's ceiling is Mo's level right now.

nyjets,345ma8,RJSSUFER,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:48:21 2015 UTC,"They do not contradict each other at all. Also, Johnson's contract averages at 12 a year, Williams averages to 16, and Quinn averages to 16.5.  It is not out there to expect Mo to sign a long term deal at 17 or maybe even a touch less with more guaranteed money."
nyjets,345ma8,Rugger11,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:56:15 2015 UTC,"But with a salary cap in the sport, why would it be preferable to have a guy at 17 mil a year for ages 26-31 instead of someone from 22-26 from 6 mil a year, even if the production for the first is top 3 while the 2nd guy is top 10, hypothetically. Take that 10 mil a year and give it to a top level OT or a top OG, and decrease one position slightly and increase the other by more."
nyjets,345ma8,RJSSUFER,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:59:52 2015 UTC,You don't know the second guy will be top 10. You know the first one is top 3. You are essentially gambling that he will pan out as expected.

I just think its too much to risk with the state of our team right now. If we had an established QB and a potent offense, I'd be more open to it. But we are most likely going to have to lean on our defense and it can't afford to take a step back."
nyjets,345ma8,Rugger11,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:03:39 2015 UTC,"You're right but you're also assuming that it would be straight up, Wilkerson for the number 2 pick, and I don't believe that Tennessee would go for that.

nyjets,345ma8,LennyLongshoes,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:30:50 2015 UTC,"This is probably just posturing by a team with a draft pick higher than the Jets. Someone (like Washington or Tennessee, for example) would have an interest in making other teams think that the Jets were willing to package Wilkerson in a move to trade up to drive up the value of their pick and possibly force their potential trade partner to offer more out of fear of being outbid by the Jets.  Does the #6 overall pick and Mo Wilkerson for #2 (likely Marcus Mariota) make sense? I wouldn't do that trade, but another team might find that scenario plausible. Certainly more plausible than the Philip Rivers rumors that have been circulating around (likely coming from the same source)."

nyjets,345xok,rillo561,7,Tue Apr 28 19:52:21 2015 UTC,"I think the highest likelihood would be from a team with a top player expiring in 2016, and a potential interest in the 6th overall pick.   FA's in 2016 that I could see being in a deal for Mo (and potentially the 6th pick or a swap of 1sts):   Philip Rivers  Cam Netwon  Julio Jones   AJ Green  Now before you say ""no chance those teams would deal those guys"" remember that Jimmy Graham is a Seahawk and LeSean McCoy is a Bill."
nyjets,345xok,B_H_Dweller,2,Tue Apr 28 20:06:10 2015 UTC,"Each of those players makes sense to me except for Cam. Carolina finally found a franchise QB, I doubt they'd trade that even for the 2nd best DE in the game."

Mac has made it clear that Mo's contract will wait until after the draft and that (imo) is the way it should be. The draft is much more pressing than a contract that can conceivably wait another 2 years (which I don't think it will, nor do I think we should wait even close to that long)."

nyjets,345u9r,Capon3,5,Tue Apr 28 19:16:34 2015 UTC,The Jets will trade from a strength to get a major weakness. Rivers makes the Jets a legit playoff team.

Wilkerson is on his rookie contract and is already a top 3 DE in the league. Why would you give up potentially 10 years of dominance for 2-3 years of being competitive? I want a QB as bad as everyone else, but not for Mo."

nyjets,345u9r,tps222,6,Tue Apr 28 15:21:43 2015 UTC,That trade did give us the pick for Sheldon Richardson though.
nyjets,345u9r,king_kong_,6,Tue Apr 28 15:25:36 2015 UTC,So what you're saying is - it's Idzik's fault that Wilkerson could be traded?

nyjets,345u9r,HaruSoul,2,Tue Apr 28 16:16:25 2015 UTC,It gave us Milliner. If we didn't trade away Revis we most likely would have drafted Sheldon at 9.
nyjets,345u9r,tps222,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:29:39 2015 UTC,How does that work? Why would we take a gamble on the guy we'd really want still being around at 13?
nyjets,345u9r,HaruSoul,2,Tue Apr 28 15:32:23 2015 UTC,Because the only reason we drafted Milliner was to replace Revis and he was seen as a better prospect at the time. If we still had Revis we wouldn't have drafted a corner at #9.
nyjets,345u9r,tps222,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:35:15 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I was pretty high on Milliner at the time too : \ , I don't know if we'll ever get any value back on that pick, hopefully he can stay healthy and really learn under the tutelage of Bowles/Revis/Cromartie."

I'm sure teams were asking about trading for JJ Watt and Richard Sherman before their contracts. Maybe another is asking about Andrew Luck too. It happens all the time."

nyjets,346asi,ocyries,2,Tue Apr 28 18:01:07 2015 UTC,"It's not a crazy idea tho, depending on what you get in return. If the Jets can't come to terms with him would you rather see him walk with the Jets getting nothing? The fact the Jets have a high pick, Sheldon Richardson and the draft is loaded with D line talent makes a trade a very strong possibility. I don't want them to trade him, but if he's only a Jet 1 more year then gone, by all means the Jets need to get something back now."

nyjets,346asi,freddie_mays,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:13:16 2015 UTC,"1) We spent most of this year's cap room, but this year's cap room has no effect on a potential Mo extension, particularly when most of the players we signed have no guaranteed money past this year      2) Why would Bowles want to ""focus on the secondary"" in the draft? We just spent millions on the secondary this offseason, bringing in 3 new corners, a new safety, and bringing back Jaiquawn Jarrett.      3) Why would Bowles want to create a hole in the DL just so he could then go on to try and readdress it in the draft when my first point (about the cap re: a new deal for Mo) is true? They even added more depth than they had last year with the signings of Stephen Bowen and Kevin Vickerson.      4) How would you know that ""Bowles probably wants to focus on the secondary and strengthen the D line, in the draft"" anyway?      5) Douzable has already resigned for what is assumedly a very reasonable contract.      6) Harrison's deal, based on his RFA tender, is 1-yr, $~3.3M, which is again very reasonable.      7) No crap Mo would ""likely fetch more on the open market if he decided to test it"" than Douzable or Harrison. Mo is an all-pro, Douzable is a reserve (albeit a good one), and Harrison is a one-dimensional, albeit very good, player. I didn't mean for that to come off very hostile, but it kind of did so sorry about that haha.      8) There is a world of difference between other teams inquiring about Mo and the Jets shopping Mo. A team inquiring about Mo could involve a phone conversation like this: Team X GM: Hi, we're interested in Mo Wilkerson. What do we have to give up to get him? Macdaddy: your first three picks in this draft Team X GM: Not interested at that price, peace hangs up. or even like this Team X GM: Hi we're interested in Mo Wilkerson, what do we have to give up for him? Macdaddy: Thanks for your interest, but we're not trading Mo. hangs up.      Also, Bowles and Mac have hardly shown that they would ""[rebuild] the team from scratch."" They signed 3 new top players at a unit that had no players that were proven to be worthy of a starting position both by previous quality of NFL play and lack of injury concerns."

nyjets,345k24,JetsStrat,4,Tue Apr 28 14:00:45 2015 UTC,"I just don't think many teams have the fire power to get up to the 2 spot.  For instance; the Browns, who have two first round picks #12 & #19 would still be around 5-600 points shy of fair draft board value if they gave Tennessee both of their first rounders.  Really the only teams with the Potential of getting up to #2 and the positional need at QB are the Jets and the Chargers.  I only mention the Chargers because they can offer something no one else can, Phillip Rivers.  However, I don't put much weight into the Rivers trade thing.  If he doesn't want to play in LA because he doesn't want to uproot his family, what makes Tennessee any better?  Because its in the south?  Money talks, I think he and the Chargers are just posturing for his next contract.    That leaves the Jets who can offer this years 6th pick, which is premium and next years first rounder, which would be graded at 1000 points for a mid round pick.  Fair board value.  Or the Jets can roll the dice and see if any one else is willing to mortgage the farm for the Kid.  I just can't see it happening.  I think Tennessee takes Leonard Williams and Mariota falls to the Jets at #6.  The only other scenario that could be something to watch for is if Tennessee takes Willams and the Browns try to trade up in front of the Jets to 4 or 5 with their two first rounders.  But I can't imagine the Browns have the stones to do that after failing on so many QB's.  If they fail on Mariota the fans might burn down the stadium and it will put them even further behind the 8-ball.  I can see them taking Hundley or Grayson or Petty with the 19th pick."
nyjets,345k24,subrhyme,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:04:37 2015 UTC,"Well said. I think your analysis in large part supports the theory that if we are interested in Mariota at 6 or trading out, we could dissuade teams like the Browns, or who knows maybe Chip Kelly, from making a move in front of us by actively downplaying our interest in Mariota."
nyjets,345k24,subrhyme,2,Tue Apr 28 15:13:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I just don't think its in the Browns best interest to trade up and risk the possibility of looking like complete clowns again.  If they draft one of the other 3 QBs, even in the 2nd round they completely limit their risk and put two more first round talents on their squad.  They are also more than just a QB away from being great.  If Mariota was thought of as an Andrew Luck type prospect, I could see making the move.  The problem is, he isn't.  If anything he's Johnny Manziel 2.0.  (I think he's much better than Johnny will ever be though)"

nyjets,345k24,dcmcdevitt,2,Tue Apr 28 15:25:41 2015 UTC,"It just seems like so many moving parts.  This would preclude that Chip Kelly had the foresight to trade Nick Foles for Sam Bradford because he knew that Tennessee wanted him and no other team would come in with a better offer.  So lets now say that the Chargers are willing to part with Rivers, and Tennessee does that deal.  Chip Kelly just fucked himself by trading Nick Foles away.  It just doesn't seem likely."

Giving up 3 first round draft picks for another unproven QB.  Or they can take one of the 2nd-3rd round guys in hopes of finding a steal.  They're not a QB away, the Jets are."
nyjets,345k24,subrhyme,3,Thu Apr 30 13:55:43 2015 UTC,I can't see Mariota dropping to six. If Tennessee doesn't take him they'll trade the pick to someone who wants to
nyjets,345k24,chris_ri,2,Tue Apr 28 14:11:31 2015 UTC,Could be. I just think that the cost of moving up to two overall is very prohibitive. Look at how the RG3 trade worked out for Washington and my understanding is that Mariota isn't graded as high of a prospect as RG3 was. But it's not out of the realm of possibility.
nyjets,345k24,subrhyme,2,Tue Apr 28 14:17:41 2015 UTC,Who has the fire power to get to #2?
nyjets,345k24,chris_ri,2,Tue Apr 28 15:25:45 2015 UTC,Multiple first rounders make a hell of a difference
nyjets,345k24,subrhyme,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:29:20 2015 UTC,Who has multiple first rounders?
nyjets,345k24,lilphil240,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:02:18 2015 UTC,I meant like future first round picks
nyjets,345k24,subrhyme,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:04:57 2015 UTC,"Ok so what team is in need of a QB and looks like they'd be willing to mortgage the future?  Running down the gamut you've got the Jets, Browns, Texans and Chargers (unless the Phillip Rivers thing is horse shit, which I think it is).    The Jets would need to give up this years 6 and next years first to get it done.  And Tennessee would still take one of the top 6 players in this years crop.  The Browns have two first round picks this year that don't add up to fair draft board value, so they'd have to give up both firsts and possibly a future first to get it done.  And if they're wrong, they look even worse than they already do.  Conversely they can take one of the remaining QBs in the 2nd round and not look like total assholes if they're wrong.   The Texans, there hasn't been any chatter about them trying to make a move but they need a QB.  They'd have to give this years 1st, next years 1st and more compensation to get up to 2, way too prohibitive.  Can't see it happening.   The Chargers could get to #2 by giving the Titans Phillip Rivers and probably another pick.  The Titans have Zach Mettenberger.  In no way shape or form is he Phillip Rivers, but if they trade out of the pick with the Chargers and don't get a first in return they're not getting as good a deal as if they would if they trade with the Jets.  You're only getting Phillip Rivers.  With the Jets you could get a top 6 guy and two first round picks next year.  I can't see SD Giving up that much for an unknown.  Rivers is the Chargers guy.  It all seems like contract posturing to me.   Or the Titans can just take Leonard Williams, who is the best player on more or less everyone's board.  I can't make any other trade up make sense in my head.  The Jets are the only team I can see with the proper ammo to trade up, and I don't think they will.  I think they get Mariota at 6"

Or two second rounders.  Or they could just do the smart thing for once and take a QB in the 2nd round.  Even if Marcus Mariota turns out to be Andrew Luck, the Browns aren't going to be good.  If they take 2 first round talents and a 2nd round QB they might dig themselves out of the hole they've dug over the past ten years of trading up for QB's"
nyjets,345k24,mosherd14,6,Tue Apr 28 16:23:25 2015 UTC,"What happened to all the Jets-Mariota hype?   It is where it belongs.  My hunch is that the Jet's aren't drafting Mariota, even if he drops to 6."
nyjets,345k24,Shrimpola_Cola,3,Tue Apr 28 14:03:59 2015 UTC,I'm not advocating for or against drafting him. I simply think it's suspicious that the hype seems to have died out in the last week or two leading up to the draft and now every story we hear seems to reject any NYJ interest in Mariota.
nyjets,345k24,king_kong_,6,Tue Apr 28 14:23:06 2015 UTC,"That's a crazy statement. Jets need a QB and we won't have as high a draft position in upcoming years. No doubt we'd pick him up at 6.  The need to trade up can be debated (although I think if he passes Tennessee, we'll reach for him regardless), but he's for sure our pick at 6 if not the for keeps, for draft trades."
nyjets,345k24,Shrimpola_Cola,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:26:22 2015 UTC,Another big point of the presser was Macs emphasis on best player available and how dangerous it is to reach on need. I think it's far from a sure fire bet we take him at 6 and would say almost out of the question to trade up considering this is a former scout with only six picks in his first draft..
nyjets,345k24,Fishbirds,2,Thu Apr 30 03:19:29 2015 UTC,"The ""negatives"" on his scouting report sound too similar to Geno's.  I don't want him, I'd try to deal him to chip."

nyjets,345k24,subrhyme,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:40:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not a big believer in Bradford, but I'd probably go for that.  If he's healthy it would be a steal.  But I'd rather get Beasley if he's there."
nyjets,345k24,rillo561,2,Tue Apr 28 17:53:28 2015 UTC,"Jets sit and 6 and call TEN's bluff. If they draft Mariota, fine, if not, I think he slides to 6. Jets then take Mariota because there is nothing this team needs more than a franchise quaterback. Not saying mariota is one, but a stellar defense isn't enough to go the distance."

Not to mention, he was pretty highly regarded coming out of LSU.  It's not like Tennessee is a QB away from being good.  They need a lot of pieces.  Putting Leonard Williams with Brian Orakpo could really give them a mean Defense, and if Mettenberger pans out they could get themselves out of the basement quickly."

nyjets,345k24,subrhyme,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:43:09 2015 UTC,"Tell me the last time the jets developed a QB?  This team needs a 1st day starter, not a project that has to learn the game under center.

nyjets,345k24,rillo561,2,Tue Apr 28 15:45:41 2015 UTC,"The Jets did pretty well with Pennington, even though that was a completely different regime.  Regardless, if you're going to sit and wait for a kid to come out of college ready to play, you're going to be waiting an awfully long time.  Andrew Luck is a once in a generation talent."
nyjets,345k24,rillo561,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:01:19 2015 UTC,"These spread, one read then run guys haven't panned out yet. Mariota is nothing more than a healthier Dennis Dixon IMO. I don't see his game translating well to the NFL. A guy being drafted @ 6 has to start, jets don't have the luxury to have a guy sit for a year or two."
nyjets,345k24,subrhyme,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:10:17 2015 UTC,"Thats where I disagree with you.  I think the reason you're seeing these spread QB's fail is they're not given the time to transition.  Look at A-Rod, he made the transition.  It can work, they just need the time to learn.  The Jets have significantly improved their roster this year, they're not going to be awful with Geno or Fitz playing QB but they're also not going to win the superbowl.  If Mariota comes in and is on FIRE, you start him.  If he's not you can teach him while Geno and Fitz get us to 9-7 or 10-6 or 8-8... Point is, if we have to take a QB next year, we're not going to have the ammo to get one of the top guys and even if we do, we're going to have to throw him in the mix immediately, which hasn't been working for anyone lately, other than Andrew Luck and Russell Wilson, who is more a product of Seattles top tier running game."

We have a brand new coaching staff. Also I'm not worried about his leadership abilities. if I remember correctly people were concerned about Russell wilson being too soft spoken. I think Mariota has the smarts and potential to lead by example.
nyjets,345k24,rillo561,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:49:35 2015 UTC,"Well, hopefully the titans pick him up. Don't want the guy, and I don't have faith in the jets to develop QB talent, even with this new staff."

nyjets,345k24,dcmcdevitt,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:12:28 2015 UTC,"Where do you see us getting one of those? QBs are the most valuable assets in the modern NFL, teams don't really part with good ones. If we want a QB we have to develop one, the sooner the better"
nyjets,345k24,dcmcdevitt,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:13:33 2015 UTC,"At six this team needs a starter, if you start mariota game 1, the jets will be looking for another QB in 2 years. The guy isn't NFL ready, and I truly believe he won't do well in the NFL. History has shown us, these guys don't translate well in the NFL."
nyjets,345k24,subrhyme,2,Wed Apr 29 03:17:34 2015 UTC,"Assuming that all quarterbacks who are mobile or who played in a spread system are bound to fail is incredibly narrow-minded thinking. There have been plenty of successful guys to come from non-traditional college offenses who've succeeded in the NFL recently, including Aaron Rodgers, Cam Newton, Kaepernick, RGIII (before the injuries), and Russell Wilson (at NC State). Just because we had a bad experience with Geno doesn't mean spread quarterbacks can't be successful for the Jets.  Mariota ran a pass-first system, has all of the physical tools and size you'd want, is extremely intelligent, and takes tremendous care of the ball. Even if he struggles with terminology or taking snaps from under center, the Jets have a one-year stopgap in Fitzpatrick. It's not like we're winning a SB next year anyways, he doesn't have to start Day 1.   And it's better than sitting around and doing nothing, because the guys in the later rounds have way more concerns than Mariota does."

nyjets,345k24,sharked,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:14:06 2015 UTC,Given Bradford's injury history I personally would prefer the relatively unknown potential of Mariota over Bradford. Wouldn't mind trading for more early round picks though.

However, if he was on the board at 6, and Chip kelly offered up Bradford, I think there would be a lot to consider there. Should be interesting to see what happens."
nyjets,343obf,_vsrs_,4,Tue Apr 28 01:25:27 2015 UTC,What do you say to taking him in the second?   Maybe. I don't really factor in character concerns to much but smoking pot several days before the draft is an extremely dumb decision. Also I'm pretty sure he needs a surgery.  That being said  top ten talent doesn't always come down to  the second round.   Mike Maccagnan said in his pre draft press confrence that character does matter and the Houston Texans front office does factor in character so I doubt we will draft him now because of this.

nyjets,344c38,JASPriest,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:10:34 2015 UTC,The way I see it we need 2 linebackers(outside and middle) to replace Calvin Pace and eventually David Harris.  We also need to completely replace the oline(obviously both guard spots and right tackle with urgency and center and left tackle to eventually replace Brick and mangold.  I say we pick up Scherff in the first and an olb in the second.    BPA in areas of need.
nyjets,344c38,CoMaBlaCK,6,Tue Apr 28 06:01:25 2015 UTC,Scherff is too big a reach at 6. He's more of a 15-20. I'd prefer 9lb at 6 for sure. Maybe trade with the browns and grab scherff and bpa.
nyjets,344c38,John_YJKR,2,Tue Apr 28 06:42:09 2015 UTC,"If Mariota is there and Cleveland makes the call, I'd definitely take their 2 firsts and trade back. I just wonder if Gregory is gonna be there in that later 1st area. If he is, Scherff and Gregory would be incredible."
nyjets,344c38,BigNuke43,3,Tue Apr 28 06:50:41 2015 UTC,I'd be happy with that. I'm not concerned much about a player using pot. My concern is his clear lack of reasoning skills or not giving a shit about his own future. Given that these guys are so young I'm willing to give a bit of leeway. Young people make stupid choices. I know I have. And it wasn't in the media for all to see. If teams decide they don't want guys because they smoke weed they are truly limiting the potential for landing a good player. Bottom line. It's only weed. It's still worth rolling the dice on him.
nyjets,344c38,John_YJKR,1 point,Tue Apr 28 07:17:34 2015 UTC,I keep hearing he's too big a reach at 6 but everybody and their mother has him going to the Giants 3 picks later.

nyjets,344c38,CoMaBlaCK,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:42:02 2015 UTC,It's not about him as much as it us about who else is available at t g e time. Scherff is going to be a G at the nfl level. So he's not a must have. There will be very talented WR and OLB available at the 6th pick. I like scherff but I'm not a fan if taking him before the teens.

nyjets,344c38,tgrabowy717,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:57:43 2015 UTC,I strongly disagree with your point about the line. Aboushi has done more than enough to prove himself at guard and we have Dozier at the other guard spot who has high potential. Giacomini has another two years on his contract and Mangold and Brick are still a few years from retirement. It's not that pressing of a need and it's certainly not worth taking a guard at 6 overall. Scherff would be a pretty poor pick all things considered.   After Aboushi took over our line ranked as the 13th best in the league

nyjets,343rl9,jetsfan07,2,Tue Apr 28 02:59:20 2015 UTC,i think gregory is the best rusher in the class i would love to trade down and grab him
nyjets,343rl9,flaccidtebowner,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:33:34 2015 UTC,"Right now, I'm thinking the draft goes:  1) TB- Jameis  2) Non-Jets team that trades up- Mariota  3) JAX- Williams  4) OAK- Cooper  5) WAS- Fowler  This would be pretty much worst case scenario for the Jets. Beasley appears to be the BPA, but I think he's a combine star. If no team is willing to trade up, I'd go Gurley, and I think the Jets would too."
nyjets,343rl9,vintagegush,2,Tue Apr 28 02:50:02 2015 UTC,"I like the Idea, we have a good backfield now but when Gurley gets to 100% when we hit the ""easy"" stride in our schedule we could win a lot of those games (OAK, JAX, WAS, BUF, TEN)"

In all likelihood, if all those guys are gone we would trade back into the #12-#17 range and then we can take Gurley. He's a first round back, but I would be shocked if he went before #14 and the Dolphins. Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybe #12 for Cleveland."
nyjets,343rl9,dagcity,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:51:36 2015 UTC,"If this happens (which is the most likely scenario imo) I think we gotta take Kevin White or Vic Beasley.  If we can trade down, target an OL or one of the OLB's that falls (Gregory or Ray)."

nyjets,343rl9,the_furry_stoner,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:12:15 2015 UTC,"Step 1-- Winston goes #1 and TEN can't get a deal they like from any of the other teams. The Jets have a sweet deal on the table, but it's not quite enough for them. They end up taking Leonard Williams to anchor that defense for years.   Step 2-- The Jags just lost out on their #1 player. They are actively looking to trade down. Once again, there are plenty of deals but none that fit what they want. They take BPA and end up with Fowler Jr.  Step 3-- The Raiders now have the best spot in the draft. Sure, they can go for Amari Cooper or Kevin White but so many teams are calling in trying for Mariota. How can they get White or Cooper and trade back? The New York Jets. We trade #6 overall, our 3rd this season and a conditional 2nd next year to move up and take Mariota. We find a QB that has actual franchise-QB potential (Sanchez and Geno were mid-level guys at best) and the Raiders are still likely to grab one of their top targets at #6.   So, I think we trade up with the Raiders after Mariota falls to #4. We don't give up a king's ransom to move up two spots and everyone is happy except Cleveland, Philly, San Diego, and Tennessee. We would have to trade up since I firmly believe they'd trade the pick if they can. The Raiders' positions of need are very deep in this draft so moving into the #10-#15 range isn't a big deal. The Jets offer is better since they can still snag Cooper or White. I think Mariota will be a franchise guy. They say he'll need a year but I don't think so. He has an unnatural ability to learn and is one of the hardest workers in the draft. He's very football smart and has the physical ability as well. He is an Aaron Rodgers-Colin Kaepernick-Russel Wilson hybrid and the people freaking out about him are putting too much into the offense he ran in college. If he's there at #4, we should go get him."
nyjets,343rl9,BreakFromToronto,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:46:21 2015 UTC,"Tennessee never wanted Mariota, put that out there so they could explore options; they never find a deal that they like so they just draft Leonard Williams as predicted weeks ago. We with the 6 pick and Mariota available trade back with Cleveland for 12 and 19. Take Randy Gregory and Jaelen Strong with the 12th and 19th pick."
nyjets,343rl9,vintagegush,0,Thu Apr 30 02:26:00 2015 UTC,"IF the price is reasonable I see us trading up for mariota (our first this year, a 2nd this year, a 3rd or 4th next year) That is ALOT but typically with a new HC and GM you see a new QB. If they ask for a 1st this year and next its so not worth it. If Vic Beasley, Amari Cooper, or Dante Fowler are there at 6, we definitely take them. If those 3 aren't there we trade down for mid/late 1st and another 2nd. So then we'd have a 1st, 2nd and another 2nd. We draft an edge rusher or OL with the 1st, either Bryce Petty/Hundley with the first 2nd, and get Phillip Dorsett with the next 2nd."
nyjets,343rl9,jrg114,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:23:38 2015 UTC,I was with you until Petty/Hundley  Neither of these guys are going anywhere in the NFl for 2 years at least. IMO Grayson is the 3rd best QB  prospect in the draft. Also neither of those guys are worth a 2nd rounder. High to mid 3rd at best.
nyjets,343rl9,vintagegush,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:31:45 2015 UTC,"I don't like Hundley at all, I do like Petty though. You're right that they won't start year 1 but Bowles and Magic Mike are looking to find ""their"" guy. I wouldn't mind Grayson and I would love if we got someone in the 3rd-5th round and stock up at OL/Edge rush. I was thinking 2nd round because other teams are in need of QBs, but there's no predicting what will actually happen."

If that's the case and they are that high on Dupree I hope they at least trade back, I feel that we might value him a lot higher than other teams. I know that Bowles, a disciple of Parcells likes bigger LB's but with Coples playing LB I feel like we already have one big LB, however Dupree seems to be a well rounded prospect in both pass rush and coverage. But who the hell knows what anyone is thinking right now."

Think of our team as the back to back AFC championship team, but with a disruptive D-Line. Same secondary, maybe even better than those years. The offense will be an interesting one as it has the making to be over average, but QB play brings the possibility of once again leaving us a well below average offense. I still think it's nearly impossible for our team to do worse than the Giants and even people in our sub are under-rating our upcoming season."

Josh McCown was coming off a crazy productive year with a 109 QB rating.  He went to the bucs and floundered.  They obviously are not the same player, but it sets up my next comment.  Ryan Fitz has never even come close to his 95.3 QBr.  Last year was 12 points higher than his next highest QBr.  I would say Foster, Hopkins, and A. Johnson is easily the best offense he's ever played in.  He is an AVERAGE QB who will rise and fall with the talent around him.   If you take away (obviously, you cannot) his 6 TD routing of the Titans last season, his QBr drops almost 8 points.  No player goes from being decent from the years 2005-2013, then becomes a lightning rod QB for the remainder of his career.  He is the ultimate backup.  You give Geno the keys one more time.  If he cannot keep it together for 3-4 games, you throw in Fitz and hope for the best."

Who knows how Fitzpatrick does with this crew? It's definitely better than any he had before. An actual TE, 3 WRs, and three decent RBs. Buffalo he only had a good but injury prone RB and a decent TE, and Houston he had two top 20 WRs and an injured Foster.

nyjets,33zrpw,John_YJKR,7,Tue Apr 28 17:04:12 2015 UTC,"I've felt confident that Fitzpatrick will be the starter since he arrived. He's the Jets' Trent Dilfer. He's no one's first choice, but he's a good fit for the way the team is built. Limit the miscues, hit the open guy, and do it again after the defense gets the ball back.   And if the Jets do land Cooper in the Draft, you can add a burner that will outrun the D while Decker is doubled and Marshall is working underneath. There's Ridley now, an RB that's well versed in running screens, and a good core of runners to kill the clock.   If Fitz is up for the challenge, and the play calling complements those strengths, this team could be a lot better than expected. Close to a win-now program rather than rebuilding with a stop-gap QB."
nyjets,33zrpw,John_YJKR,2,Mon Apr 27 11:42:49 2015 UTC,He's definitely not underrated but it's possible he can lead you to 10-6
nyjets,33zrpw,sameolejets,6,Mon Apr 27 15:11:34 2015 UTC,I agree about the potential. It seems most fans here are under the delusion that geno will be our starter.
nyjets,33zrpw,otomotopia,9,Mon Apr 27 04:07:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's fair to call them delusional, but I agree that Geno is gonna drop out of this league quick. He's only around because of the contract. I wish he'd suddenly turn into an elite quarterback, but he obviously isn't on that path right now.  I don't think his problem was processing the field though, that was how he made a living at WVU. He had to make tons of pre-snap reads and he was allowed to adjust the offense as he saw fit. So I have no idea what his developmental issue really is."
nyjets,33zrpw,CosmicWy,4,Mon Apr 27 04:10:56 2015 UTC,He does it too slowly and makes mistakes when pressured. The jets oline had a couple bad games in pass protection last year but overall they finished 8th in pass protection. Geno has had time. He just doesn't process the speed of the nfl game 90% of the time. It's a problem from the neck up for geno for sure.
nyjets,33zrpw,CrimsonToaster,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:31:57 2015 UTC,"He has bad technique glitches too, like not setting his feet before making a pass.  The ""getting sacked from 10 yards from the line"" translates into not reading and making a decision in time.  I suspect his available receiving talent has given him the yips & self-doubt.  And lets face it, the NFL is a different environment than college, especially from the QB perspective.  Maybe Geno Smith just can't cut it.  He certainly doesn't look like he can learn quickly enough to improve his game.  But 2015 is his year.  He's under a spread offense coach.  He won't have to worry as much over pro-set offense concepts.  He has talent in his offense.  The OL was ranked 8th in pass protection.   If Geno can't make it past training camp or the first 4 games, he's really hopeless garbage."
nyjets,33zrpw,John_YJKR,1 point,Mon Apr 27 07:18:29 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe that Geno is better than what he seems. Idzik got him a WR1 in Harvin and his completion percentage goes up 10% and he turns from 7-10 TD/INT to 6-3. Marshall could improve those numbers.  That protection stat is seconds until the QB is sacked, IIRC. Did you see the number of times Geno was flushed out of the pocket, increasing the time to sack? The guard position needs a serious upgrade so we can cut down on hurries and pressures.   Either way, I'm expecting a completion this year. I just don't think Geno is slated to win or lose, and that this is the year to prove himself one way or the other."
nyjets,33zrpw,akaneel,7,Mon Apr 27 13:13:19 2015 UTC,"another day, another opportunity for /u/John_YJKR to describe non-Fitz devotees as delusional."
nyjets,33zrpw,John_YJKR,2,Mon Apr 27 12:27:41 2015 UTC,This thread proves that fans can talk themselves into anything.
nyjets,33zrpw,jvene1,-2,Mon Apr 27 16:27:29 2015 UTC,It is absurd to think geno can beat fitz in a qb competition based on the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
nyjets,33zrpw,John_YJKR,5,Mon Apr 27 15:06:10 2015 UTC,Geno has had two years in the league.  Fitzpatrick has had 10 years.   Let's see if Geno improves this offseason because you are assuming Fitzpatrick can match his 2014 season
nyjets,33zrpw,jvene1,-1,Mon Apr 27 15:30:18 2015 UTC,Oh I forgot qb improve over the off season. Oh wait. They don't. He's had plenty of starts. We should have seen something more consistent by now. His ceiling is as a back up. He has the physical tools but he is missing the key part. And that's from the neck up. He struggles to process the speed of the nfl game. That's coach able but most guys with that issue never overcome it.
nyjets,33zrpw,John_YJKR,5,Mon Apr 27 16:41:02 2015 UTC,"So your knock on Geno is that his ceiling is a backup, yet you're in favor of Fitzpatrick whose ceiling has already been reached and is established as a backup?"
nyjets,33zrpw,jvene1,0,Mon Apr 27 19:02:13 2015 UTC,This is not about either of them being great qbs. This is about who is better now. No geno will not be better.
nyjets,33zrpw,CosmicWy,2,Mon Apr 27 19:11:58 2015 UTC,Fitzpatrick isn't getting us to the Super Bowl and is an old journeyman. Geno has 2 years under his belt. We don't know what we have in him yet. If we gave up on every 2nd round pick after their second season we would be awful.
nyjets,33zrpw,John_YJKR,-3,Mon Apr 27 19:29:07 2015 UTC,I'm telling you. Geno is done on the jets. The rest of you can meet me in reality when the staff forces you to accept it.
nyjets,33zrpw,JDandJets00,3,Mon Apr 27 20:37:51 2015 UTC,"It's ok to have different opinions, but unless you have a time machine you aren't telling us about you need to lose that ""I know more than you, I'm right you're wrong"" attitude. It's growing tiresome on this sub."
nyjets,33zrpw,CosmicWy,2,Mon Apr 27 21:58:49 2015 UTC,"overwheming evidence?  Hyperbole much?  the evidence is flimsy.  the two QBs are much closer than you present them when you literally only call people delusional.  Geno has made strides for improvement from season 1 to season 2 despite a terrible OC, meaningful player injuries, and general lack of talent on offense.  He has been hot and cold, but it's not like he's shown us nothing.  Meanwhile, the overwhelming evidence you seem to have is that Fitz has been OK for years and last year was his best yet, after 9 years in the big leagues.  His game log, btw, has some stinkers, if you look.  I will admit that he was great last season (for those 11 games he played - not counting that last colts game).  The cold reality is Fitz is a journeyman who is average at best, despite his latest resurgence.  If Fitz can play at a high level on the jets, there is no reason to think geno cannot.  When the decision between two players is upside vs known quantity, you ALWAYS CHOOSE THE UPSIDE.  Fitz is here to hedge a bet.  That bet is Rookie QB or Geno.  Geno starts until they pull the plug.  Fitz will step in and do well.  seriously: Find more words that mean delusional."
nyjets,33zrpw,John_YJKR,0,Mon Apr 27 17:20:52 2015 UTC,"Delusion is a false belief. That's what fans have in geno. I never said fitz was amazing. I've stated he isn't the answer and that he's not amazing several times. The point is he is better than geno. If we are going to give geno a break for his supporting cast then fitz gets the same because he never had a good cast on the teams he played on till last year. And what do you know? He played well. Every qb from brady to hoyer has bad games every year. Fitz is clearly better than geno. And he takes care of the football. No. You do not take the guy with upside and start him hoping he plays well. You start the guy who is currently playing the best. Period. You seem to think the staff gives a shit about geno. They don't. They brought in fitz to start long enough while they develop a young qb. And at 32, with experience in the same offense, and a low turnover rate he is perfect for that role. Geno is done in new york. He'd have been cut already if he wasn't on his rookie contract. Unless fitz gets injured geno will never start for the jets again."
nyjets,33zrpw,JDandJets00,4,Mon Apr 27 17:33:48 2015 UTC,"Uh Fitz played awfully when called upon his rookie year. He sat two more years, than played awfully when he started in his 4th and 5th years. His ENTIRE tenure in Buffalo he averaged a 78.5 QBR, almost exactly the same as Geno had in his 2nd year. Your delusional.    Edit: Another fun fact: Fitz' career Int% is the same a Geno's last year. Seriously, what are you talking about?"
nyjets,33zrpw,MongoJazzy,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:21:06 2015 UTC,great addition!
nyjets,33zrpw,John_YJKR,-1,Mon Apr 27 18:42:43 2015 UTC,It's you're.  This is not about fitz being an amazing qb or how well he did in the beginning of his career. Or the fact that you're comparing a 7th rd pick to a 2nd rd pick that was projected as the best qb in his class. It's about who is better right now. Who is more likely to help win the game? That's Fitz hands down.   Like I said. Those bills teams were very bad teams. And you compare career stats to career stats. You can't just cherry pick shit. Let's compare last year int% fitz was at 2.6 geno was at 3.5. Enough said.
nyjets,33zrpw,c39j8b,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"Geno cut his INT% by 34% from his rookie year, do you think he honestly can't cut it even further with hopefully a better O-Line (even though we ranked alright overall in the season in protection, it was evident that we got a lot better throughout the season, and his numbers improved right along side)? Also the improvement at reciever with BMarsh and hopefully the growth of Amaro should help out too. With all of those, do you think Geno couldn't have a year similar to Fitzpatricks last season?"
nyjets,33zrpw,John_YJKR,3,Mon Apr 27 18:59:50 2015 UTC,the fact that you think most fans are delusional is not fair and in fact is kind of a dumb comment.  gene was the starter last season and none other than our HC has stated that geno is the starter for now.  are you saying that Coach Bowles is delusional as well?
nyjets,33zrpw,c39j8b,1 point,Mon Apr 27 11:45:29 2015 UTC,The only reason geno is considered qb1 is because he was the starter and fitz can't practice because the broken leg. Mac signed fitz to start. They fully expect him to win the job. The new staff have nothing invested in geno. It's not a coincidence they signed fitz who played in Gailey system in buffalo. Fitz has always taken care of the ball. A huge weakness for geno. He's only turning 33 this season. Fitz is coming off a 95.3 (9th in the nfl) passer rated season. The truth is both qb might as well be brand new to the team. There is no starter right now. Bowles will go with the qb who is better. He's nit going to pick geno because of potential. I def see. Fitz crushing geno in competition. I see them drafting their own qb to develop behind fitz if fitz plays well. I don't see geno ever starting for the jets again. His contract 8s the only reason the staff hasn't dropped him.
nyjets,33zrpw,John_YJKR,1 point,Mon Apr 27 12:06:46 2015 UTC,"I agree that it isn't a coincidence that they signed fitz who played in Gailey's system, but the reason I see for it is where we disagree.  I believe they signed Fitz to help mentor Geno in the new system.  Geno has all of the physical tools to be a successful QB but still makes some mental mistakes.  Bring in a veteran that knows the new system to help work with Geno to get his mental game where it needs to be.  On a related note, if Fitz is so good, why did Houston get rid of him for almost nothing?  Why did they bench him last year when he wasn't injured?  You know, the same year he had the 9th best passer rating in the league...  Because he just doesn't have the physical tools to be a starter in the NFL.  For that same reason I see him losing the job to Geno and only becoming the starter if Geno completely flops through the first quarter of the season."
nyjets,33zrpw,MongoJazzy,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:10:18 2015 UTC,They thought their younger QBs they have would be better for their system. Mallet still has potential and is younger. And Fitz broke his leg and won't be ready to practice till camp. So deal him for a couple picks. He was on a short contract anyway. He wasn't part of the long term plan for the Texans and he's not part of ours either. Mallet offered similar ability and is only 26. There was no reason to pay Fitz 3.5MM for the season to sit there. It only made sense to trade one of their QBs. And they brought in a younger QB in Hoyer as competition who has shown he can be a decent starter. The Jets are not going to sacrifice the first quarter of the season for Geno's potential. The new regime didn't draft him and is looking to go a different direction.
nyjets,33zrpw,matap821,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:37:15 2015 UTC,"So basically you're saying they did almost exactly what I, and a few others, are saying the Jets are doing.  Choosing potential over a known commodity and bringing in a competent starter to help motivate their young QB with potential.  I will throw in the caveat that they have seen a lot less of Mallet than we have of Geno so it's not exactly the same, however, for that reason it would appear to be a bigger gamble on their part.  We do have some idea of what we have in Geno, someone who has all the physical tools, shows flashes of being a very good QB, but needs to learn the mental aspect of the game.  So bring in a veteran who can help teach him the mental part.  I can see your arguments against Geno, and there is a very good chance you will be correct come next season.  As a fan it has been tough watching his bad play, but teams choose potential all the time, it's the reason so many young players get thrust into the starting QB role every year."
nyjets,33zrpw,M3nt0R,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:08:10 2015 UTC,Mallet and fitz are the same. In fact they chose mallet over fitz. The situation is different.

nyjets,33zrpw,anon5848,2,Mon Apr 27 22:29:28 2015 UTC,"I'll give Geno that Chan Gailey's offense seems a lot more like his college offense, which says that Bowles chose Gailey as an OC to give Geno one last shot. Fitz was then brought in because he's already familiar with the offense. I think it's still Geno's job to lose, but Fitz was easily the best choice available to bring in."

nyjets,33ymf5,sameolejets,3,Sun Apr 26 23:07:27 2015 UTC,"if fitzpatrick can be on the top of his game which is just game managing   You're ignoring the fact that Fitzpatrick never fronted for a stacked offense.  The OLs he played behind were shaky, and he never had superstar WRs, TEs or RBs.   If Fitz starts, we're going to have a QB who knows who to quickly dump off to, without ever having a Decker, Marshall, or Amaro.  If this offense can't fly, its not going to because of Fitzpatrick.  Right now, by seasonal QB rating, Fitzpatrick is better than Geno has ever performed.  You're shitting on the wrong QB.  Also, there is no game managing with a spread offense with no running game.  You either fire away and win, or you die."
nyjets,33ymf5,anon5848,2,Mon Apr 27 10:23:41 2015 UTC,you have a point my biggest concern about fitzpatrick is his health and recovering from a broken leg

I'm guessing you'll see Cromartie and possibly Revis get burned more by younger, quicker receivers.  I think this year's team is capable of taking the division.  But we won't know until after the first game of the season.  Who starts at QB?  Will Gailey's spread offense gell?  What will the defense look like with our new secondary & DC?

nyjets,341br8,shadowrabbit,8,Mon Apr 27 15:05:37 2015 UTC,Legit question: Why is QB such a huge question for the Jets but not the Bills? I don't really know the Bills' situation all that well but Ryan Fitzpatrick is decent and Geno Smith has the potential to be even better. Are the Bills QBs that much more of a sure thing? Or is it the team around the QB that makes everyone predict them to be so good?
nyjets,341br8,TreSeven,2,Mon Apr 27 16:15:19 2015 UTC,"It's because Kyle Orton had 18 TDs and 10 INTs while Geno had 13 TDs and 13 INTs. Despite Geno's stats dramatically after we acquired Harvin, the seasonal stats are what people are looking at and they don't compare well.  It makes people see the Bill's QB situation as one that could be improved, but the Jets as a gaping hole. I don't agree, but at least it makes sense when put that way."
nyjets,341br8,otomotopia,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:10:34 2015 UTC,Orton retired. They're stuck with EJ at QB who is Josh Freeman 2.0.
nyjets,341br8,Deigs,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:30:44 2015 UTC,"It's honestly a legit question, and I think you're right, if it does go all wrong for Buffalo it will go wrong at QB.  That said, Buffalo last year went 9-7 basically with no offense (26th passing, 25th rushing, 18th in points per game) and all defense (4th against the pass, 11th against the rush, 4th in points allowed).  I think everyone who thinks Buffalo will be good (myself included) basically boils down to, this is already a Rex Ryan team.  They lost Orton (who was a game manager at best last seasoned) but gained McCoy and a running game you know will improve under Rex.  Assuming Rex Ryan and Doug Marrone are equally good in coaching, Rex is a better motivator who gets the most out of his players and his defense.  Accordingly Buffalo should be as good, if not better, just with Rex as coach if all other things are equal.  So TL;DR - They sucked at QB last year and went 9-7, they should have the same if not better defense, a better run game, and a Rex Ryan who we know gets his guys to play up.  But the counter is last season's record may have been a fluke, Orton to EJ/Cassell is a bigger dropoff than people expect, and Marrone may have actually been a great coach who is as good as a defensive coach as is Rex."
nyjets,341br8,John_YJKR,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:14:57 2015 UTC,I see them losing a lit of close games where they won last year. I see them at 8-8. The jets on the other hand I see start fitz right away and win a lot of close games because fitz takes care of the ball. I see the jets with a surprising 11-5 record.

nyjets,33y900,Fishbirds,7,Sun Apr 26 23:56:01 2015 UTC,Seeing as Fitz has a broken leg I don't see why Geno doesn't have a chance.
nyjets,33y900,John_YJKR,3,Mon Apr 27 00:30:35 2015 UTC,It's a broken leg. Pretty standard injury with normal recovery to 100%. He's going to be ready for camp. He played in this system under Gailey when he was in buffalo. He had the 9th highest qb rating in the league last season. It's very naive to think fitz was not signed to start. Mac signed him for a reason. They want to move on from geno. If geno is suddenly good then great but we've seen enough starts to know what he is. The only reason he's technically qb1 is because fitz is still recovering. Then there will be a competition and there's no way he beats fitz who isn't amazing but us definitely a much better qb who is only 33 and coming off his best season.
nyjets,33y900,Fishbirds,3,Mon Apr 27 01:00:42 2015 UTC,"I agree fitz could start, and I more than believe they are prepared to start him, but I think they would love to see Geno win the job in camp. I think its Geno's job to lose at this point, not fitz's by default."
nyjets,33y900,John_YJKR,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:15:46 2015 UTC,It's no one's job. They both might as well be new to the team. So the question is who wins the job in a competition. And that's going to be fitz. I wish geno were better cause that would mean we'd have a young serviceable starter. But I'm realistic. Geno isn't good enough to win that competition.
nyjets,33y900,sameolejets,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:27:19 2015 UTC,"My theory is that Geno is 50/50 to Fitz in the starter sweepstakes right now.  Geno has to sell Gailey and Bowles that he can be an NFL starter, in an offense which reflects Geno's history.  If G&B are sold, Geno's going to start the first two games.  Coaches like the idea of developing the future, as long as they can win enough games to keep their jobs.  If Geno shows any deficiency that's not corrected in training camp, there's no way he wins the starting job from Fitzgerald.  Frankly, from a Jets fan point of view, what scares me about Geno is that he becomes a zero as a QB, and there's no obvious reason for it (other than his mistakes).  Some games, he looks sharp, other games, he looks like an incompetent boob.  And he doesn't only look incompetent against above average defenses.  There are defenses the Jets should shred, but for some reason Geno just doesn't perform as expected.  That's why I really don't like Geno.  I'm scared he's going to sell the coaches on his potential, and then its going to be an 8-8 season, when we're wondering why Geno ""didn't show up"" for this game loss or that loss."
nyjets,33y900,John_YJKR,1 point,Mon Apr 27 07:32:08 2015 UTC,They aren't interested in geno potential. Whomever us the best qb in camp will start. If that's geno then good but no one is holding their breath.

After the 2 good playoff runs in Rex's first years Joe realized he would get lots of attention by being very critical of the Jets, and that's exactly what he did.    After he started to get more publicity he turned it into getting paid for his analysis.  I know this because Mike Francesa covered it a few times answering callers questions about why he never had him on.  His answer was basically he wanted to get paid and took his services to those who would.

The reason these rumors started are because Rivers doesn't want to sign an extension without knowing how the whole stadium situation is going to play out. The connection to the Titans being a trade partner is because of comments Rivers made about the Head Coach there, his previous offensive cord, and the fact the Chargers have met with Mariota and Mariota's agent said that he is only allowing teams that have a real chance of getting Mariota work out with him. If Rivers is going to get traded it would be for a QB and for the 1st or 2nd pick. Not 6th."

nyjets,33zu4n,jetsfan07,2,Mon Apr 27 05:18:01 2015 UTC,In what world would Tennessee even consider that trade? IMO the only chance they trade Rivers is in a deal to get Mariota or an absolutely massive package that realistically nobody would ever give.
nyjets,33zu4n,Blitz93,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:23:14 2015 UTC,"In a world that they know, 100% unquestionably that they will not be able to convince Rivers to stay and they end up minimizing losses before it's too late. I'm not saying a 2nd and Coples is fair for them, I'm saying that's what I'd be willing to give up. The 1st is too valuable in this top heavy draft, plus we have no guarantee to have him past one year."
nyjets,33zu4n,jetsfan07,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:24:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean you'd absolutely have to have assurance that Rivers will sign an extension after being traded to even consider trading for him. If you did, I would easily give up the 1st and more. I highly doubt he would sign an extension here though, so it's a moot point."

nyjets,33udfp,mwax321,2,Sun Apr 26 20:16:12 2015 UTC,EXACTLY!... I love that there is a popular consensus on this sub that the Jets should just trade back out of their pick and pick up an extra first round pick next year so they can grab one of the top QB's.

nyjets,33udaz,Wumbo52,4,Sat Apr 25 18:40:02 2015 UTC,I'd give TB whatever they wanted for Winston.  I don't really want Rivers.
nyjets,33udaz,Shrimpola_Cola,7,Sat Apr 25 23:51:35 2015 UTC,I think Rivers would automatically become the greatest Jet quarterback since Broadway Joe. He still has 4-5 good years left and he's been pretty consistent with Antonio Gates as his best receiver for years
nyjets,33udaz,boredymcbored,1 point,Sun Apr 26 04:06:11 2015 UTC,"We have such a high pick and with how much we've beefed up the team, I see it being a second until we have a pick so high. We should go for a player with more longevity. Rivers shouldn't even be a consideration IMO. We've had woes at QB so long, draft one with a potential to squash that bad luck."
nyjets,33udaz,Rugger11,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:19:40 2015 UTC,"Sure, sign me up for 2 firsts and a 3rd. Only if he sits this entire season.

nyjets,33udaz,guccibento,-2,Sun Apr 26 09:04:46 2015 UTC,No more than I'd give for Mariota.  I keep wanting to like Winston but his lawyer's comment + his recent clumsy excuse for the crab legs theft just keep reminding me that he's not mature enough to be a quarterback for a big boy team.
nyjets,33udaz,boredymcbored,2,Sat Apr 25 20:47:54 2015 UTC,"I mean I think most of the things he did are typical 21 year old stuff. Sexual assault aside, I don't think anything else he did is really character questioning. He'll mature as he ages. I think he'll honestly be fine."
nyjets,33udaz,guccibento,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:24:13 2015 UTC,I dunno if you can just set the sexual assault aside though
nyjets,33udaz,boredymcbored,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:14:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think you SHOULD but it's the NFL. Unfortunately, multiple players get away with sexual assault charges. As a woman who's been assaulted, I'm frankly am disgusted by it, however we all know how easy it is for the league to overlook this issue."
nyjets,33udaz,SmokinMidnightOil,2,Mon Apr 27 22:25:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly yes he is pretty immature but I believe he can overcome that by his second year and be a serious threat. The things he gets in trouble for doesn't reallly bother me cause it's not like he has a drug problem like a Josh Gordon or is partying all the times like Manziel, he just doing a lot of little kid things which is fine with me because he's just a college student at the end of the day. What really matters to me is can he be a good QB, which I think he is. He might be the best QB since Luck which is hard to come by. Also he proved he can play under the big lights and under pressure which is what you need in New York. The reason most people hate on Mariota is because he lacks confidence and said himself that he hates the spotlight so New York is most certainly not the right place for him"

nyjets,33tg39,otomotopia,4,Sat Apr 25 13:34:45 2015 UTC,"It seems like Maccagnan likes to fill positions of need in free agency and grab the BPA'S  in the draft, and I agree with that philosophy.   I think we could be set at RB, despite the criticism that we need more speed in the backfield. The way our offense looks on paper is that we grind down the field with as much time of possession as we can manage. We have several big targets who run routes and body up beautifully, and our RBs are pretty much guaranteed three yards if they get past the line of scrimmage.   And Powell works as a pass protector and can make plays off the wheel or delayed flat routes.  While I'd like to see more speed in the backfield, I'm comfortable with the roster as is. If Polk is available for a cheap price, I'm up for getting him. Otherwise, the position group is good enough to just let it be."
nyjets,33tg39,TsTrT,2,Sat Apr 25 13:42:24 2015 UTC,"Someone else had this question/post yesterday, and it must have been deleted.  Polk is not a need. We have Ivory/Powell/Ridley/D.Richarson and most likely a draft pick at RB. If Polk signs a 1 year deal, he will just be a backup and barely get playing time barring injuries. He is not a need, save the remaining cap space for June and Camp Cuts."

nyjets,33tg39,Wumbo52,-1,Sun Apr 26 12:47:04 2015 UTC,If this involves cutting Ridley then im all for it
nyjets,33tg39,Blitz93,3,Sat Apr 25 21:40:15 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't, most likely. Ivory and Ridley have ever similar running styles, and it often causes them injury. Having two players who can have similar (if not slightly lesser for Ridley) impacts on the game and prevent eachother from getting too run down... it should work out. Remember, Ivory was often on the injury list for hamstring and quad issues. Getting him some rest only can help."

nyjets,33tjdv,SmokinMidnightOil,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:45:41 2015 UTC,"We need a QB.  We have the ability to sit him and teach him the game... when is the next time we'll be able to do that? We can hold our breath forever trying to find the right QB or we can take a chance, in a year that we've significantly upgraded our team to the point where adding an OLB or WR isn't going to make us that much better.  Adding a QB, if he pans out, could vault us deep into the playoffs."
nyjets,33tjdv,MongoJazzy,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:08:45 2015 UTC,"Mariota would not ""vault"" us deep into the playoffs. He's a rookie coming from a non pro-style offense. If he starts week 1, we're 2-4 coming out of the gate until he gets acclimated.. and if he's a flop we have to watch another team use our 1st round pick on (knowing the Jets luck) some amazing talent that'll end up burning us down the road when it hurts the most... Take the picks, take whose there."
nyjets,33tjdv,the_furry_stoner,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:52:21 2015 UTC,"Thats why I said we sit him and teach him the game.  Whether we take Mariota or not, we have Geno/Fitz starting at QB.  Lets call that an 8-8 record and pick 16 in next years draft (seems likely).   If Mariota comes into camp and has a Russell Wilsonesque start to his career, we're off to the races and yes he would ""Vault"" us deep into the playoffs.  If not we teach him for a year and he's ready to start next year with a year of experience under his belt, instead of picking a QB next year and throwing him to the wolves.    If he doesn't pan out we're not that much worse for the wear.  Will it suck to not have a first round pick in the draft, YES.  But the definition of this team as it stands is this, ""A team with NFL level talent at every position except the QB""  it will be exactly that again next year if we don't draft Mariota, it might be different if we do draft him."
nyjets,33tjdv,RodKimble_Stuntman,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:22:17 2015 UTC,"And here's where we differ... I don't see Mariota as an ""NFL level talent."" That's why it's not worth it.... I see more sense in trading Wilkerson to move up and grab Leonard Williams than giving up 3 1st rounders for Mariota."
nyjets,33tjdv,woodchips24,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:30:18 2015 UTC,"A) you'd only probably have to give up 2 first round picks.    And  B) Trading Wilkerson for Leonard Williams is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Wilk is our own home grown stud who is a proven NFL power house.  Williams is a prospect, who may or may not pan out in the NFL.  Why would you look to downgrade the position?  To save money?  Guys like Wilkerson don't come around every day."

nyjets,33tjdv,woodchips24,2,Mon Apr 27 14:06:35 2015 UTC,I don't think we move up unless we can steal the #2 pick. I think Mariota isn't worth trading up but would love him at 6. I think we trade back to 10-14 and take Gurley/Scherf/Beasley.
nyjets,33tjdv,woodchips24,2,Sat Apr 25 14:19:35 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what we'd have to do for the #2, too. If we have to give them what the Redskins gave up to get RGIII I'd say it's not worth it."
nyjets,33tjdv,woodchips24,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:32:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think you'd have to.  RGIII's draft stock was MUCH higher than Mariotas is.  There were people talking about how he should go before Luck.  I think this and next years first will get it done, maybe you'd have to throw another mid/late round pick in."
nyjets,33tjdv,TheRooster27,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:13:27 2015 UTC,"I can see that too, I just don't know who were trading back with.  Getting up to the sixth pick from 10-14 is going to cost a 2nd rounder.  If Mariota isn't there who is going to be willing to give up their 2nd round pick for a WR or an Edge rusher when there is a dearth of them available in the draft.  And if he is there, I can't see the Jets not taking him."
nyjets,33tjdv,VinnyThePoo1297,2,Sat Apr 25 14:48:10 2015 UTC,We better not be giving up next year's first for a huge question mark.

It doesn't mean there's definitely going to be a big problem, but it matters. I think it's a warning shot by Mo and his agents to the team.  Last year, every Jet including Mo showed up for voluntary workouts, so missing these workouts without a specific reason, while allowed, is notable. It's especially notable when there is a new coaching staff to get to know."

nyjets,33rxrb,PlatinumDaKid,11,Sat Apr 25 01:16:09 2015 UTC,"Ideally I'd love it if Cooper was still available by our pick and we could snatch him up. Marshall isn't getting any younger and he could be a great #1 wr for the future. And the corps of Marshall, Decker, Cooper, and Kerley would be awesome for years to come. If Mariota is available I think we have to draft him and I don't see us passing him up, other option here is to find a partner and trade down which is a very real possibility and puts the jets in a very good position if he is in fact there at 6. And lastly a stud pass rusher to complete our sick defense would be awesome to have, weve been lacking a true stud pass rusher for years now and this could be our chance to grab one."
nyjets,33rxrb,OprahSwagfrey,2,Sat Apr 25 01:22:07 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing. Im not sure where the Jets are with Geno. But building that core receiver group as well as a skilled o line could put him, fitz or another qb in a great opportunity to succeed. Cooper is more pro ready, but White could also bring that play making ability to take the top off a defense and open up the field. Where as Marshall and Decker are more possession based."
nyjets,33rxrb,Jets__Fool,2,Sat Apr 25 01:27:02 2015 UTC,You're forgetting we have Amaro too. I think we're fine on pass catchers I would much rather an Oline men or pass rusher at 6 then grab a WR later.
nyjets,33rxrb,matap821,3,Sat Apr 25 18:11:59 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of grabbing Scherff or a stud pass rusher, then wait and hope DGB is available in the 2nd. He'll be bit of a project, but we have time given our current receiver corps."
nyjets,33rxrb,Jets__Fool,2,Sat Apr 25 18:17:37 2015 UTC,Absolutely.
nyjets,33rxrb,akaneel,5,Sat Apr 25 18:26:10 2015 UTC,"The ideal situation for me is just staying at 6 and taking Cooper, White, Fowler, or Beasley.   As beast of a player he's going to be, I pray to god we don't take Randy Gregory. If he's dumb enough to fail a drug test he knew was going to happen months in advance, he'll do some other shit as well. Mariota would be okay but honestly I don't want to spend the 6th pick on a question mark.  Hypothetically if they do trade up it should only be for Winston, but he's pretty much a lock for the Bucs so that's not happening unless Macc Daddy sells the farm and Idzik's soul  If we trade down we should draft Scherff or Shane Ray, assuming he makes it that far."
nyjets,33rxrb,tlk742,2,Sat Apr 25 01:44:04 2015 UTC,Actually I recently found our booing rate has dropped significantly in the past years
nyjets,33rxrb,JASPriest,2,Sat Apr 25 04:34:11 2015 UTC,"I have absolutely no idea who the Jets will draft, but I am absolutely convinced that Cooper will be an elite WR and I want him."
nyjets,33rxrb,Dacious96,1 point,Sat Apr 25 05:10:31 2015 UTC,"Since this is Mac Daddys first draft, we really have no idea what he is going to do. He has said he isn't opposed to moving up or down but would rather collect more picks. The Jets have been working out a lot of the top draft prospects and it really is going to come down to the board. I believe we are going with BPA regardless of need.   In regards to who I want. Cooper because I believe if he is at 6 he will be the BPA. If we are going to go edge rusher I like Beasley. If Mariota some how falls to 6, Mac might draft him because he is a potential franchise QB.   For the player I don't want at 6 is Shane Ray, i just have doubts about his ability to play as a rushing linebacker standing up."
nyjets,33rxrb,Wumbo52,1 point,Sat Apr 25 03:16:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly we're all just as confused as everybody else, which I love because that means every other team in the NFL is just as confused. Most of the fan base don't really like Mariota but we wouldn't be surprised if we take him, although trading up to get him would piss most of us off. The consensus pick for us would have to be Cooper from what I'm seeing but even he might not be available at 6. So I think we are going to go for a stud pass rusher like Beasley or Fowler if they are there because then our defense would be complete and even more unstoppable. Personally I would love for Mariota to fall to 6 so we could trade down with the Browns and take their 2 first round picks and get DGB and possibly a pass rusher or Guard"
nyjets,33rxrb,rvbcaboose1018,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:13:46 2015 UTC,"I'd like Cooper or Beasley. But honestly, a part of me also wants to trade down for a pick this year and a pick next year."
nyjets,33rxrb,Rugger11,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:48:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, at 6, I'd only be happy with Winston, one of the top two OLBs, or Cooper. If not one of them, I'd want to trade down. In the most ideal world, trade the sixth to Cleveland for their two firsts. Then grab some mixture of the best OLB, O-Line, Gurley/Gordon and then the odd man out or a WR in the second."
nyjets,33rxrb,woodchips24,1 point,Sat Apr 25 07:13:01 2015 UTC,"I would love for Vic Beasley to set this defense off and make it an absolute monster. I'm not as high on Fowler as everyone else, so I'd rather avoid him. Cooper or White would be cool. Mariota is a question mark, but I can see why they would draft him and I wouldn't be upset with it. In a trade down scenario, I would want Scherff, because we could use a decent guard. There isn't anyone worth trading up from 6 for."
nyjets,33rxrb,Jets__Fool,1 point,Sat Apr 25 11:18:44 2015 UTC,"Ideally we get Mariota or winston without giving up next year's first.  Probably won't happen. If we stay put at 6 my favorite pick after that would be a pass rusher. Our D front is nasty but it is built of guys who are better against the run. Putting a legit pass rusher opposite coples would add a dynamic new element to our front. I'd love fowler. I'd be ok with Beasley Shane ray or bud dupree. I initially wanted randy Gregory and I think on the field he would be the best addition but I'm worried about his failed test. If it's not a QB or pass rusher, then I wouldn't mind scherff.  Our Oline isn't getting any younger and scherff is an instant plug in and boost to our running game. Guy I don't want at 6 overall is any WR. We have 2 very capable starters and a solid slot guy. We just drafted a skilled pass catching TE in the early 2nd last year. I am not convinced Cooper is the best WR in the class over White but I want neither at 6. We'd be passing up obvious talent at positions of need."
nyjets,33rxrb,sameolejets,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:24:40 2015 UTC,"Guy I don't want at 6 overall is any WR. We have 2 very capable starters and a solid slot guy.    You don't get it.  Chan Gailey is our OC; he runs a spread offense.  The key to not having a punishing run offense, or pro-set offense, is that every player eligible to receive the ball is a threat.   Decker is an excellent WR, but he's probably not a dominant WR1.  Brandon Marshall is an awesome WR, but he's probably closer to the downslope on his career.  He's probably here more for his ability to fight to catch a ball, than his ability to ""make space"" for Decker.  That leaves Kerley.  I know fans like Kerley (I do), but Kerley has not proven that he's all-pro possession receiver, like a Chrebet or a Cotchery.  Bilal Powell is closest to a pass catching RB, and he's a nobody.  Ivory nor Ridley are known to be pass catchers.  Amaro is our only ""real"" pass catching TE.  What happens when Gailey puts in a 2TE, no RB set?  The Jets need more receivers.  We're going to get them in the draft.  Its highly likely we need to draft a WR1 in the 1st or 2nd round, because right now, we don't have a WR1/2 type that can stretch the field.  Unless there's a RB that resembles a Walter Payton or LeSean McCoy in the first round.   Everyone says Scherff is not special enough to be worth a #6 pick.  (I'd love it if Jet's management was willing to prove the analysts wrong.)  Its either that, or draft TE's, RB's & WR's in the later rounds, and we saw how that worked for Idzik last year.  The ""conventional"" wisdom is that we take an edge rushing OLB or Mariota with our #6 pick.  But make no mistake, the Jets still need 1st round level WR, TE, & pass catching RBs.  (And OLB, OG, OT, etc.)"
nyjets,33rxrb,Jets__Fool,1 point,Mon Apr 27 06:18:46 2015 UTC,I understans that we need more pass catchers and I agree with you for the most part but I still would rather stay away from cooper or white at 6 and take a chance of  someone like dgb or agholor in the 2nd.

I answered in your /r/nfl thread and I said I wanted Beasely or Winston(even though Winston isn't going to happen). Id prefer to trade down. Honestly I really don't want to draft Mariota in the first but thats just me also Bud Dupree should be considered a ""last resort"" kind of pick."
nyjets,33rxrb,subrhyme,1 point,Sat Apr 25 03:01:24 2015 UTC,"Well you can forget Trae Waynes, I think the Jets fulfilled their secondary needs this offseason.   To me it is all contingent on what goes on before them, and the fact that they are in desperate need of a franchise signal caller.  I think there is a possibility of the Jets trading up to the 2 spot to grab Mariota, however the Chargers and this Phillip Rivers chatter is starting to look a lot more like something that may happen.  What I don't get about the whole ordeal is this, Los Angeles isn't that far from San Diego.  Is it that well documented that he doesn't want to play in LA?  Thats a story for another time though.    If Mariota is there at 6 I think it's a no brainier the Jets take him, they've worked out numerous QB's and its obviously their biggest need.  They're not going to be picking this low again for a while, hopefully, and Mariota seems to have the needed tools to become at least a good QB.  With time, which the Jets could afford him, he could be great.  (15% chance of this happening)  If the Chargers aren't able to get a deal done with the Titans for the #2 Pick I think there is a 75% shot the Jets trade up and give up next years first rounder to do so.  Obviously in this scenario they take Mariota as well.  (60% chance of this happening)  If neither of the above happen and the Titans take Mariota, I think you see the Jets take the Best Edge Rusher still available.  In my opinion that is going to be Either Randy Gregory or Vic Beasley.  (70% chance of this happening)  In a scenario out of left field, Mariota lasts till the #6 pick and a team trades up with the Jets and the Jets wind up snagging a few extra picks.  Likely candidates are; the Browns, the Chargers, the Texans.  I don't see this happening because its my belief that if he's there at 6 the Jets will take him.  Also the Browns have struck out on so many QB's in the recent past that doing it again and giving up 2 #1's will be franchise suicide, I can much more realistically see them taking Brett Hundley with one of their 2 first rounders.  Also the leap up for the Chargers and Texans would be huge, like giving up next years first round pick and then some huge.  (Chance of this happening 5%).  Another scenario would be the Jets take Kevin White or Amari Cooper, whoever is left after the Raiders take their WR.  I can see this happening too, I just don't think WR is as much of a pressing need this year.  Though the two top guys seem to be sure things, you never know when a player looks like that much of a lock.  (Chance of this happening 25%)  Ultimately this is how I see the first 6 picks unfolding:  1- Tampa Bay- Jameis Winston QB/FSU  2- NY Jets (trade with Titans, Titans get 6th Pick, and NYJ 2016 first round pick) Marcus Mariota QB/ORE  3- Jacksonville Jaguars- Leonard Williams DE-DT/USC  4- Oakland Raiders- Amari Cooper WR/ALA  5- Washington Redskins- Dante Fowler OLB/FLA  6- Tennesse Titans- Vic Beasley OLB/CLEM  I know I have it as a better shot that the Jets wind up with an edge rusher, however I just think it's unrealistic to see the Chargers trading Phillip Rivers, who is their identity for an unproven QB that really could use a year on the bench.  This guy IS the Chargers.  I understand the contract conflicts, but this also could all be posturing for his next contract.  As in ""you know I don't want to go to LA, lets make it worth my while to go"".  To me, when it seems like there are too many moving parts, its usually not going to work out.  But hey, I could be wrong."

nyjets,33rxrb,sameolejets,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:00:43 2015 UTC,"2- NY Jets (trade with Titans, Titans get 6th Pick, and NYJ 2016 first round pick) Marcus Mariota QB/ORE   Why on earth do you think MacCagnan would do something crazy like this???   The Jets probably will look to trade down first.  Mariota is just not ""blue chip"" enough to make the move worth the while.  As much as I dislike Geno, he comes out of a spread system, like what Gailey coaches, and Fitzpatrick did well under Gailey's system.  I think we take Mariota if he drops into our laps, but I'm guessing the MacCagnan's first instinct is to trade down.   I just think it's unrealistic to see the Chargers trading Phillip Rivers, who is their identity for an unproven QB that really could use a year on the bench. This guy IS the Chargers.    I don't understand why, but Charger management is not sold on Rivers anymore.  It doesn't help that Rivers isn't happy on the Chargers either.  Oddly, as much as I think Rivers is a good QB, I'm not anxious to ""break the bank"" on him.  I suspect the Chargers have a persuasive reason to be willing to trade Rivers.  I'm guessing Rivers is close to his downslope in his career.  Let me say this: you have to make risky calls to get ahead, whether its life or the NFL.  But you never make gambles on something you don't believe in.  If MacCagnan ""believes"" in Mariota, he's ours.  But I don't think he feels that strongly about him, and moving up would be ""betting the farm"" on Mariota.  There does not appear to be any sure things in this draft, and that's why two sketchy QBs are getting all of the attention, not the other positions.  The Jets still need a lot of parts, and all those new parts can use development.  If Mariota falls into our lap, he's probably the guy we take, and properly develop (as in practice squad).   Otherwise, we get a fairly good tradedown offer, and get a couple more high round picks, or we snatch the best edge rusher on the boards.  (Or MacCagnan truly believes in BPA, and we draft another DE...)"
nyjets,33rxrb,subrhyme,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:56:52 2015 UTC,"Firstly, these are all guesses.  Your thoughts, my thoughts, Mel Kipers thoughts.  Trying to get yourself a franchise QB isn't crazy.  Geno Smith has had two years to show off his goods and he has been benched and has looked pretty bad the rest of the time.  Yes he had a perfect passer rating week 17 last year but he also has had a negative 18 passer rating when he threw 3 picks in one quarter to the Buffalo Jills.  Throwing another year away with him at the helm isn't in the best interest of the team and having Ryan Fitzpatrick as the stand in if he doesn't pan out again, which it's my contention that he wont, is basically putting us right back in this position next year, except we will have to throw our newly drafted 2016 QB right into the game; like we have so many times already with typical results.  Unless we have the future already waiting in the wings in the form of a one year seasoned Marcus Mariota, hopefully that year affords him the opportunity to learn the speed of the game and get accustomed to what he will be seeing.    Second, Trading back seems like a great idea, except if the popular consensus is that Winston will go #1 and Mariota will go #2, whether to the Titans or whomever else, who is trading up to the 6th spot and for who?  There is decent receiver depth, great OLB depth, great mid round OL depth, Who is going to give up multiple picks to get to 6?  Enough where you, as a Jets GM, would rather be drafting in the 15th spot as opposed to taking a stud OLB or WR at 6?  I don't think trading back is in the Jets cards this year.    Third, If the Jets do trade up and take Mariota, they will already have 2 capable QB's on the squad.  They can sit Mariota a year and let him learn in the same vain that other ""system"" QB's have in the past.  QB's like Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers... The Jets haven't had the opportunity to teach a QB the NFL game in a long time.  It's basically been throw the guy to the wolves and hope he pans out.   I don't think that a chat-rooms worth of Jets fans have a better football acumen than the front offices of most NFL teams, and most NFL teams see this kid as being a really great talent.  You don't hear a bad word about his athleticism, his knowledge of the game, his work ethic, his demeanor, his willingness to learn and his character.  That's a guy I would take a chance on.  Thats a guy that if he does pan out, you could be proud to call your Franchise QB.  Yes he was a product of Oregon's system but he still needed to make the plays.  He still had to avoid throwing all but 4 Interceptions... He still made a ton of plays with his legs...   The Jets have changed the path of the franchise this off season DRASTICALLY.  They aren't going to be 4-12 again for a while.  They aren't going to be able to get up to the top of the draft to take a guy like Connor Cook or Cardale Jones without moving mountains.  Also, this time last year Marcus Mariota was the golden child.  Whats to say this time next year Hackenberg & Co don't fall into ill favor and no one wants them?  The Jets have an opportunity to take a guy with the tools and they have an opportunity to teach him.  If he doesn't pan out, it's not going to kill the franchise like it would if we were say the Browns, who have a lack of talent at almost every position.  The only position the Jets are TRULY lacking any talent at is QB, and that happens to be the most important position on the field.    In the last 20 years, here are the sure thing QB's that have gone in the draft: Andrew Luck, Round 1 Pick 1;  Matthew Stafford, Round 1 Pick 1  Peyton Manning, Round 1 Pick 1.  If you want to wait for a sure thing to come along, you're going to be waiting a long long time.  You have to pick your spots and get lucky.  The Jets are in a unique position this year that affords them an opportunity to be wrong.  I'm not saying I want to be wrong, just that if they are it's not going to really change the landscape all that much.  They also are in a position to teach and Mariota, per NFL insiders, is the type of kid who is able to learn.    They need to take the chance.  They need a franchise signal caller.  Guys like Andrew Luck don't come along but once ever 10-15 years and you just have to happen to be the worst team in the league to get him.    I also don't really understand the Phillip Rivers thing, but it stinks of contract negotiations to me.  Rivers has made about $120 million in his career, you're telling me he can't have a house in SD and LA or just make the commute?  He talks about uprooting his family like they're moving from San Diego to the Moon.  What better way to maximize your final contract then the feign displeasure with an impending move?  He is the face of the Chargers, for them to move on from him would set the franchise back decades.  Especially if Mariota doesn't work out.  And those fans are finicky to begin with.  I think ultimately they will work out a contract and he will stay in SD for the balance of his career."

If we can't trade back for either Gurley or Gordon we should pick him up late."
nyjets,33rwlm,BigNuke43,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:32:18 2015 UTC,"But are RBs really valued enough to take at #6 or trade up back into late 1st? I mean, we've had a good running attack these past few years with guys who are by no means superstars. Honestly, I think we're still in need of a young #1 receiver. So, I would forgo one of the backs, take White or Cooper at #6, and if Gregory somehow slips late in the 1st, trade back into the 1st and get him.  If they're both as good as advertised, we're a playoff team."

nyjets,33rwlm,Rugger11,2,Sat Apr 25 10:16:14 2015 UTC,Not a chance. We have limited picks and we'd do better with picking at out spot at that situation or trading down. Not up. Also really hoping we don't pick Gurley at 6.
nyjets,33rwlm,jamtakno,1 point,Sat Apr 25 07:07:47 2015 UTC,No. I will take my chances with Danielle Hunter in the 3rd or 4th before I trade away picks on him.

nyjets,33rwlm,Realistik84,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:44:17 2015 UTC,"I would not.  I really, really want Gregory.  I'd be fine if they took him at six (because this would assume that their background check on him was satisfactory).  But our offense has been abysmal, and we need pieces.  Marshall and Decker are nice additions, but one or both of them might be gone after two or three years.  We need to draft offensive talent."

nyjets,33q7if,sameolejets,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:17:16 2015 UTC,"I am suspecting that this year is a very sketchy draft.  We got a #6; but the league is implying that only the 1st & 2nd pick are really important (only for the teams that want a Winston or a Mariota).  There are all sorts of positions that are in need; from WRs, to OLs, to DEs, LBs, & CBs.  But the best guy for every position is not worthy of a top 1st round pick???  Is our #6 pick so much more valuable that the talent available after the first 5?  It appears that there aren't any ""sure things"" available this year.  At #6, I only want one thing; a HoF player.  I don't care what position.  Let him be a DE or C, as long as he's so good, he's destined to be a great player.  If we can't get that, we're better off trading down."

nyjets,33q7if,John_YJKR,2,Fri Apr 24 20:02:20 2015 UTC,Statistics show that teams that have spent more picks in the first 4 rounds have had the most success. We should trade the browns or the saints for their first rounders.

Like many, was intrigued by him sending all other teams his draft value chart so they know how we would value potential trades. Seems like a good idea to generate possible trade offers.   However, I hope, if it comes down to it, he adjusts for the specific level of desire from the other team to extract maximum value on any given trade possibility and that his chart doesn't come back to hurt him in those situations.  In other words, a certain team may REALLY want our #6 for some specific reason (e.g. Eagles for Mariota if he falls) and be willing overpay. Hate for Mac's trade value chart end up limiting what we could have gotten."

Mo: This dude has been perfecting his craft since day one. What more can you ask for than a beastly lineman who wants to be on your team for the foreseeable future?  Harrison: He does his job well. I like him a lot better in his role than Mike Devito was...even though Devito was underrated and a very classy dude to boot.  Coples: Worst case scenario--he continues being a good player. Best case scenario: he becomes a great one.  Demario: I've said it before and I'll say it again. This dude has heart and talent. Never takes a play off, and has continued to grow through all the ups and downs of the past few years.  Like Wilkerson, he hasn't been given the attention he deserves as far as hype and media respect go, but his time will come.  Pace: I've never been a huge pace fan, but I understand the value he brings to the team. He's going to free up a lot of space for Davis to do his thing.  Kerley: the underdog. dude has gluesticks for fingers and an energizer battery strapped to his back.  powell: another underrated dude. strong AND shifty, and getting better each year. he seems to like it in NY to boot!

nyjets,33rccz,tgrabowy717,2,Fri Apr 24 21:56:59 2015 UTC,Bud Dupree is probably he highest potential edge rusher in the draft.   Though I agree the Hundley and Walford picks are a little off
nyjets,33rccz,ThreeCranes,3,Fri Apr 24 22:04:43 2015 UTC,Jets picks.  Round 1. Bud Dupree.OLB  Round 2. Brett Hundley. QB  Round 3. Clive Walford.TE  Round 4. Mitch Morse.G  Round 7. Deandre Carter.WR  Round 7. Thomas Rawls. RB  My take is meh. Dupree is kind of raw he is freak atheliticly and something you can't teach(though we would have to teach him better technique). I'd prefer Hundley in the late second/early third.No Way a TE goes late day two early day three.
nyjets,33rccz,MongoJazzy,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:14:22 2015 UTC,If Mac takes Bud Dupree w/the 6th pick I will be physically ill. Every year there are combine all stars like Dupree who just aren't elite NFL football players - Dupree fits that bill 100%.   Give me Peat or Scherff over Dupree at 6.
nyjets,33rccz,kenbrellfan,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:56:13 2015 UTC,"This would be a travesty if the draft actually turned out like this.   We take Bud Dupree over Vic Beasley. Now, I like Dupree, but he's too much of a project to be picked this early. Beasley is even more athletic, and far more polished. Yes he's smaller, but it's a lot easier to bulk up than to learn pass rushing technique.  Then we take Hundley over T.J. Clemmings. This is far worse than the Dupree pick. Clemmings could easily win the starting job at RT his rookie year, and if not, he still has a very high chance of being a solid NFL starter. Hundley, just no. He's never going to be a franchise QB so why take him?  Then in the third we pass on two solid OL prospects in Marpet and Tre Jackson. Two solid RBs in Jay Ajayi and Ameer Abdullah. AND Tyler Lockett who I think could add some much needed speed to our WR core. And which future all-pro do we pass on all these guys for? Clive Walford. A TE. Who probably won't be an impact player.  Then in the 4th we should have already addressed the OL at least once, so we wouldn't have to make this pick. We could do a number of things. Durrell Eskridge at S makes sense. Maybe a flyer on a QB. A few decent WRs here.  Both round 7 picks seem fine to me although I have to admit I've never heard of either of them.  Keep in mind all of my comments are only in the hypothetical situation that this actually occurs. This would be awful."

nyjets,33pxan,akaneel,6,Fri Apr 24 15:20:01 2015 UTC,"Everything he has said makes me like him more. He also said you should fill needs with free agency and draft BPA. I agree whole heartedly with that. Unless there is only one or two positions you need, BPA is how you should go. I think,this means we end up with White, Cooper, Mariota if he's there, Beasley, or move back and pick Gurley or Scherff. I love any of those options. We're in a good spot right now."
nyjets,33pxan,the_furry_stoner,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:32:15 2015 UTC,"How far back do you think we can move and still get Scherff? I personally think he's the best fit for our team in the top prospects, but I don't see him dropping past #9 to the Giants."
nyjets,33pxan,matap821,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:23:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think we trade any further back than 10. I could see the Giants going BPA as well. If an edge rusher is there like Beasley, I can see that. I think Scherf can fall all the way to 12"

nyjets,33pxan,Shesaidshewaslvl18,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:00:32 2015 UTC,"I feel like the previous GMs have relied too heavily on both the draft or FA. This new regime has a good balance. Money drastically improved our secondary, the weakest piece of the team and a position that takes a while to adjust to from college. I feel like the Tanny guys would clamor over Kareem Jackson early or try to sign Demarco Murray instead of another key secondary piece. The Idzik regime seems like they would have kept the money in house. Harrison, Wilk, and Coples could have been overpaid this year. No way we go in on Revis and the Pats get him at 14 mil again. I doubt we sign many FA until we have to overpay someone late. Then we go into the draft and trade back or take Scherf too early to fill a need like we did with Milliner. This feels different. Maybe I'm just not used to it haha."
nyjets,33pxan,the_furry_stoner,3,Sat Apr 25 04:22:07 2015 UTC,"My final prediction is that we stay put at 6 and draft Amari Cooper who will easily be the BPA.  Besides immediately helping the QB to succeed (whether it be Geno or Fitz), Cooper would be mentored by BM, Decker and Kerley - pretty solid vet group to learn from.  Pretty sure the last time we took a WR in the 1st round was Santana Moss in 2001.  Especially after whiffing on Stephen Hill, its time to address this position with a can't miss prospect."
nyjets,33pxan,mgdass,2,Fri Apr 24 15:55:31 2015 UTC,Amari Cooper who will easily be the BPA.   Oakland might pick him.
nyjets,33pxan,Shrimpola_Cola,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:07:40 2015 UTC,Hopefully they get Kevin White
nyjets,33pxan,TreSeven,2,Fri Apr 24 17:09:57 2015 UTC,"White's the BPA if we're picking WR imo. Not that White is significantly better than Cooper right now, but he's got a higher ceiling and has much better immediate impact than Cooper given our QB situation."
nyjets,33pxan,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:10:02 2015 UTC,I couldnt agree more.
nyjets,33pxan,MustacheDanger,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:19:54 2015 UTC,"We can agree to disagree on ranking the two prospects, but how will White immediately have more of an impact than Cooper. Cooper can easily play slot WR for us next year, beside BM and Decker. White cannot really play slot, and our starting WRs will take precedent over him. I feel like Cooper, at the very least, will get more reps his rookie year compared to White."
nyjets,33pxan,Axel3419,2,Fri Apr 24 17:33:49 2015 UTC,"White can totally play slot. Big slot is not a new thing in the NFL, Calvin spends a lot of time in the slot, and even Marshall spent time in the slot in Chicago. The reason White fits better is because his ability to adjust to throws and his catch radius and ball tracking is going to cover up a lot of the timing issues and inaccuracies all the QBs on our roster have. We can't take advantage of Cooper's route running because no one on our team can throw it to him on time or place it well, and we don't know if we'll ever have a QB in the next 2-3 years that will be able to do that. White's breaks on timing routes are as good if not better than Coopers, but his vertical stem is a lot stronger (and obviously much more dangerous) which is going to help give him just as much separation. Plus White's redzone presence, physically and skill-wise, is a lot better and being that our current starting QB is incredibly indecisive in the redzone, having a guy like him in the redzone is going to help cover more issues. Same goes if we get new QBs.  I actually have White/Cooper kind of tied on my board and think they're really more based on who your QB is than their own value as prospects. Although i think White can become a better player overall than Cooper- i don't really want to project that amount of development on him."
nyjets,33pxan,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:41:49 2015 UTC,"there's a Saints wanting to move up to get Beasley rumor, they would have to get up above Chicago at 7. The Jets would take those two picks and run."

nyjets,33muhe,jvene1,5,Thu Apr 23 21:57:02 2015 UTC,David Harris was a free agent that the jets resigned to a fully guaranteed two year deal. Decision to pick up Coples was released weeks ago but may have not been official.
nyjets,33muhe,crnipps,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:06:43 2015 UTC,"Huh, you're right. I don't know what it was but I remember reading on this subreddit a month or two ago that we exercised options on our LBs and I thought it mentioned Harris for some reason."
nyjets,33muhe,jvene1,4,Thu Apr 23 22:19:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Manish reported it a couple weeks ago.  I guess it's not really the same thing since one was reporting that it was going to happen and the other reported that it did happen."

nyjets,33muhe,games456,2,Thu Apr 23 20:44:14 2015 UTC,Huh. Does this mean we aren't going OLB for the draft?
nyjets,33muhe,matap821,7,Thu Apr 23 20:46:02 2015 UTC,I think all things being equal it would make it much more unlikely. But we have no real way of knowing what they are thinking.  Edit - Interestingly it was just announced that Shane Ray needs surgery. Maybe they were sold on him at #6 but now that he needs surgery they are going a different way so they took Coples option.
nyjets,33muhe,games456,4,Thu Apr 23 20:47:58 2015 UTC,That... makes a lot of sense.
nyjets,33muhe,matap821,5,Thu Apr 23 21:17:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's just a sign that they're filling up all the holes on the roster so we don't ""need"" anything in the draft."

nyjets,33muhe,MongoJazzy,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:48:48 2015 UTC,He is a DE. He only played OLB for us because Sheldon is such a baller.
nyjets,33muhe,CrimsonToaster,3,Thu Apr 23 21:11:03 2015 UTC,But that hasn't changed. He'll still be playing OLB unless I missed something huge.
nyjets,33muhe,matap821,2,Thu Apr 23 21:16:24 2015 UTC,It's not like it'd be a surprise if they choose not to use him as a olb. He's been ok at it but that's it. This does not mean we aren't going olb in the draft.
nyjets,33muhe,John_YJKR,2,Thu Apr 23 21:26:40 2015 UTC,"Also, even if Coples plays well as a LB, we still have a hole to fill on the other side. The Pace side."
nyjets,33muhe,CatfishHugo,2,Thu Apr 23 21:31:42 2015 UTC,I don't get this at all. I don't think Coples would get $8 mil on the free market.
nyjets,33muhe,sjets3,2,Thu Apr 23 20:55:55 2015 UTC,Really? I feel like any team that runs a base 4-3 would love Q to be a starting DE for them at that price.
nyjets,33muhe,mayor_juana,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:04:56 2015 UTC,"I do not think they would but he would get something close I think.. The issue is I have no idea how Bowles is valuing him. For all we know maybe he wants to play him on the line. Maybe we draft Williams and run a 4-3 or 4-2 line with Williams, Richardson, Wilkerson and Coples. Which would be terrifying by the way.  There is no way to know but if you look at what he did in Arizona it would not surprise me."
nyjets,33muhe,games456,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:05:36 2015 UTC,That money is completely unguaranteed until the first day of the 2016 league year.  Gives the team tons of leverage without any real commitment.
nyjets,33muhe,1CUpboat,2,Fri Apr 24 11:48:10 2015 UTC,"I think maybe Bowles likes what he has seen from Coples after watching film and will utilize him better. I've though Coples would be trade bate for a team that runs a 4-3. I guess Bowles figures if he can have a big year this year in his system, which is blitz heavy, than picking up the option now will be at a discount of what he could get on the open market. Doubtful that the Shane Ray surgery has anything to do with it."

Stubhub is what I also used to purchase away game tickets that included the Foxboro Playoff win and AFC Pitt game.  Stubhub is guaranteed. Ticketmaster is a direct service tied in with NFL officially. It's the simplest way to sell season tickets and I do use it, purely out of convenience. Stubhub is the only website I use to buy tickets though. Every game is guaranteed and if anything happens then the seller is banned and your money is refunded. I highly doubt there are many, if any, scammers on Stubhub because they're the only ticket sales, aside from Ticketmaster, that is guaranteed.  Advice: Wait until a day before the game, or the absolute latest, before the deadline to buy tickets. A lot of people have automatic price reductions in order to sell tickets. So if you wait then the price can drop dramatically.  TL;DR Use Stubhub but wait until the last minute to buy awesome, cheap, guaranteed seats."

I have heard of a few people around reddit being denied entry to the gig (ticket already used) but getting a refund, as stub hub couldn't find more seats which would suck if that's the only chance your going to get to be at a game in NY, after all holidays aren't a cheap affair and don't come around every nfl season (especially because I book holidays in advance and normally miss whatever god-damn city they're playing in by a day or two).  The main thing for me, if I'm a good 3000 miles away in a different country I don't want to be having to call stubhub on my phone (at around £1.50 a minute) whilst I want to be inside the stadium with a beer in hand.  It's just a risk I wouldn't want to take whilst in a different country,  If it was for an event in the UK I would be inclined to use stubhub for definate to save on ££, but when you way up the  potential issues that may arise its not worth it for myself, holidays are for relaxing and getting drunk, not stressing on a phone call.  TL;DR if It was in the UK would use, if on hols wouldnt...."

nyjets,33lbnf,redworld,2,Thu Apr 23 14:31:06 2015 UTC,"Ticket Exchange is the official re-seller for season ticket holders.  Our ticket accounts actually link directly to the site if we want to sell seats or even parking passes.  It's guaranteed.  The issue for buyers and sellers is that you're not allowed to post seats for under face value, so you wont get any deals there.  StubHub.com is also reliable and you can list seats under FV.  Tickets aren't out yet though.  Any purchase you make now is pending arrival of tickets to STHs which is usually late July."
nyjets,33lbnf,KayGatsby,2,Thu Apr 23 13:42:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I don't really mind not getting a deal tbh, I see tickets around $70 that seem fine. With regards to buying anything now, once I make the purchase on Ticket Exchange, are the tickets guaranteed? As in, the STH can't decide later on once they receive their tickets that they want to keep them instead? Would you advise waiting for tickets instead of buying them now?"
nyjets,33ndd0,Hyperdrunk,27,Thu Apr 23 22:50:18 2015 UTC,Two trade-wilkerson posts in one day. I'm going to need you guys to calm the fuck down before we trade away what's been the most solid thing on our team since 2012.
nyjets,33ndd0,jamtakno,7,Thu Apr 23 23:13:06 2015 UTC,"Especially for Mariota of all people. Maybe Winston would make a little sense, but even that's stretching it.  A guy like Wilk is such a big part of our defense that it's hard to replace him; he's a lifetime Jet."
nyjets,33ndd0,Deigs,3,Fri Apr 24 05:12:04 2015 UTC,"If you love something, let it go"
nyjets,33ndd0,mathees,7,Fri Apr 24 01:16:24 2015 UTC,The fan base would revolt. There is no way this is reality. The likely scenario is they keep their 6th and draft bpa.
nyjets,33ndd0,John_YJKR,12,Thu Apr 23 23:19:55 2015 UTC,"There's no way I'm trading a sure fire elite play like Mo Wilk for a somewhat unknown in a draft pick. Especially for a project like Mariota.  Damn, winning that Titans game was great."
nyjets,33ndd0,kuyakew,4,Thu Apr 23 23:09:52 2015 UTC,I know. Fuck that game. I remember saying the Jets should have let the Titans win with the last play to invest in their future but this sub called me a shitty an in response.  What now?

nyjets,33ndd0,NannigarCire,-1,Fri Apr 24 00:17:11 2015 UTC,Tell me about it. And those guys somehow justified that stance. I still don't understand how you could even root for that win and call yourself a Jets fan.
nyjets,33ndd0,YetiGuy,3,Fri Apr 24 00:31:57 2015 UTC,Holy shit it never ends. We would've had the 4th pick not the 2nd so it wouldn't have drastically changed the Mariota sweepstakes. Either way who the fuck cares why does there need to be a snide remark at the end of this? Some fans wanted to win games others wanted a better draft pick neither was right or wrong just a difference of opinion but neither side will let it go.
nyjets,33ndd0,Sir_Duke94,5,Fri Apr 24 02:33:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, let's trade someone who is going to be a perennial all-pro dominant player for a prospect who never ran a pro-style offense."

nyjets,33ndd0,blinkme123,3,Fri Apr 24 02:12:46 2015 UTC,This troubles me
nyjets,33ndd0,guccibento,3,Thu Apr 23 23:18:31 2015 UTC,"Titans get Muhammad Wilkerson, an extra early 2nd round pick, and an extra 1st round pick in 2016. Jets get Marcus Mariota and a pass rusher at 6.   We trade our best player and a good portion of the  farm for an unproven quaterback . Honestly I would be livid if the Jets did this."
nyjets,33ndd0,ThreeCranes,3,Fri Apr 24 00:28:50 2015 UTC,No way do we give away our best piece to the strongest part of our team.  Great teams are built upon the battle of the trenches.  This is why we are 100% going to use at least one pick on an offensive lineman too.
nyjets,33ndd0,LooReed,2,Fri Apr 24 00:49:05 2015 UTC,"I sure hope this doesn't happen, because trading up for Mariota is one of my biggest nightmare scenarios. Even if he turns out to become the greatest QB the league has ever seen, at this moment I could not imagine giving up our yearly All-Pro snubbed DE for a prospect like him."

nyjets,33ndd0,GV22,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:36:30 2015 UTC,"Mariota isn't a great QB right now  He's not even a great prospect, just a good one"
nyjets,33ndd0,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:38:44 2015 UTC,Yeah but you said you wouldn't trade for him even if he was the greatest qb to ever play  I don't like Mariota as a prospect either
nyjets,33ndd0,GV22,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:48:30 2015 UTC,"I meant that even if Mariota does turn out to be great, Mariota as a Prospect isn't worth Wilkerson."
nyjets,33ndd0,NannigarCire,2,Fri Apr 24 04:09:24 2015 UTC,"The last thing the players on the team need is to lose morale and fear for the future. Trading Wilkerson will make that happen. He's staying put. Harrison and Richardson would be very unhappy, and I assume Revis wouldn't be too happy either considering they seemed to be great friends. Coples is the only one who may be traded, but even that is unlikely."
nyjets,33ndd0,jetsfan07,2,Thu Apr 23 23:05:31 2015 UTC,nonnonononononononono please no
nyjets,33ndd0,thibaultdp,2,Thu Apr 23 23:07:18 2015 UTC,If Coples has a true pass rush threat opposite him he can be a productive OLB regardless. He's very good at stopping  the run from the outside and still gets into the backfield on a regular basis even if thay doesn't turn into sacks. As a pass rusher look at Pernell Mcphee's use in Baltimore as a highly productive interior rusher as an OLB. That said he looked very good on the line last year.
nyjets,33ndd0,danomite555,2,Thu Apr 23 23:28:06 2015 UTC,"1) No way the titans don't take our 1st round pick this year. They won't just trade out of the 2nd and not have a 1st rd pick.  2) Trading away a proven talent for a player who has a lot of question marks regarding his ability to place in the next level is extremely risky  3) Wilkerson has been nothing but a team leader and player. Even though Wilkerson has vastly outplayed the monetary amount of his contract, he has not held out or complained at all. This isn't a type of player you want to trade away.  4) He's home grown product and one of the best and if not the best player on the team right now.  In conclusion trading Wilkerson for Mariota is a stupid trade and if Mac makes this kind of trade on draft day he will not only anger the fan base for trading away a probowl caliber player, but anger the teammates and show them that no one is safe."
nyjets,33ndd0,Dacious96,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:15:36 2015 UTC,"There is no way in hell this will every happen and heres why.   1) The jets would be giving up a first AND second round draft pick.  2) They would be replacing a top 5 DE with a below average DE who rarely even plays the position anymore.  3) They would be replacing a good OLB with a rookie who hasn't proven he can even stop the run. 4) They would be replacing one project of a QB with another, possibly bigger project (although he does have a higher ceiling) QB.  There is just no way this will ever happen."
nyjets,33ndd0,matts77,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:43:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it just seems like way too much motion... I could see if they were giving up just one player for the pick or multiple picks for the #2 pick but this is all over the map..."

I think you only get one against Buffalo x2 and Miami x2 and one against either NE, TEX, PHI, IND or DAL.  That puts you at 6. 7 if you manage to split with both Miami and Buff.   I think 6.5 is a perfect line and I could see it going 50/50 either way really."

I don't think the Bears would pass on Williams at 7, so we'd be the ideal trade partners for a team targeting Williams. Maybe the Falcons (with new Defensive HC Dan Quinn) offer us the 8 pick and their 2nd round to jump in front of the Bears."

I wouldn't be surprised if they took Brett Hundley with one of their first round picks instead of trading up.  At least they still get 2 first round picks that way.  If they package the picks and take Mariota and he flops.... HOOOO boy, they'll be in trouble."

nyjets,33jg4v,Rugger11,6,Thu Apr 23 03:25:52 2015 UTC,"Randy Gregory or Amari Cooper  Gregory, in my opinion, is the best pass rusher other than Fowler. And I think he has turned the corner as far as his drug use, he seems like he has the motivation to be great in the NFL. And on the real.. who can live in Nebraska and not be high..   Amari is a safe pick, a true crowd pleaser and a great investment for the future of our WR corps. Not to mention giving us maybe the best receiver in the league.   Other than these two, I say trade down. Pick up an OL like Scherff, Collins or Humphries, or maybe Bud Dupree depending on where we fall back to."

I just think the potential reward for a player like Gregory outweighs the potential risk associated with a marijuana infraction in today's changing NFL (and overall society).

nyjets,33jg4v,rvbcaboose1018,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:51:52 2015 UTC,"Cooper or Beasley I would be happy with either.  Really the only 'wildcard' situation that would come into play is if Mariota dropped to us.  If Mariota goes off the board before us we are 100% going with BPA according to the Jets board, which most likely is Cooper or Beasley.  If Mariota somehow falls to us, then we have something to think about (trade opportunities, or just straight-up pick him).      On another note - I'm still not really sure why Kevin White is projected as a better prospect than Amari Cooper by a lot of experts.  Can someone explain this to me?  Everything I have read has said that Kevin White has all of the elite physical traits and measurables for a perfect WR, but is more of a raw talent and hasn't really proved himself on the field.  Whereas Cooper is basically Sammy Watkins 2.0 in terms of measurables (like almost exactly the same physical build) but with better stats and more impressive film.  Why are they putting the 'project WR' higher than the 'sure-thing proven WR.'  Doesn't make sense to me."
nyjets,33jg4v,BruceWinslow,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:41:36 2015 UTC,Kevin White is flashier. The experts love the flashy players. I think Cooper goes before White when all is said and done.

Cooper should be taken ahead of White anyway, Fowler isn't as good of a rusher as Beasley or Dupree, Williams shouldn't even be a consideration for us, Winston was never going to be available for us, and if we still have Mariota, Cooper, and elite edge rushers still on the board than Mariota shouldn't be a consideration either"

They DO NOT broadcast the fins up here, ever, and I love me some Pats, and some old Browns (as in Jimmy, and Frank Ryan), a couple of old ""worthy foes"" from the Raiders, Donks, Jim Kelly stands almost alone as a leader and character guy.  So Tannehilll's coming-out party is this year if you're correct. Now Fran Tarkenton was a great QB. But he had a problem. Every SB, he...kinda disappeared:  In 3 SBs, he went           46 -    89 for 489 yds, 1(count 'em (1) TD, 6 Int  Long-30  AVG- 43.7   RUSHING 5-17 for 1 TD   (Long)-8  I',m probably wrong, but for some reason I can't get out of my head, I can't escape this feeling that Tannehill may be the next Tarkenton. Exciting to watch. Good, not great skills in all areas a QB needs to succeed. Plays the Hell out of the regular season.  Yeah, I'm just as glad to not be R. Tannehill this season. The Bills, Jets, and Pats are all gonna be shin-kickers (the ones I call ""tooth-pulls"").   But maybe, since other than Brady, there is no solid QB anywhere else in the East, I may be Tanny's turn.  We'll not be hurrying Spring and Summer, ladies and gents.  Football season (the first in ten years with no Big Fella in camp, sniff) will come soon enough."

Suh should solidify the middle of our D line helping to stop the run and freeing up Wake from constant double teams. Also the pats defense is definitely going to take a hit this year compared to last.  I doubt they will be bad, but certainly not as good as last year.  Also Tannehill and Brady are both 1 year older.

There is virtually no threat of us taking Williams due to Wilkerson and Richardson being on the team.   But this doesnt mean we can't be trade partners. If Williams does slide (which he won't) if a team wants to get a head of the Bears we would be the ideal trading partners.
nyjets,33hdyj,Dacious96,2,Wed Apr 22 16:28:47 2015 UTC,"Wtf? I would never in my life doubt taking Williams. Harrison is a RFA, Wilkerson isn't extended yet.

Most other 34 NT I've googled is listed around 325 on average, those two being below average weight and yet very much above average at the position. So obviously weight doesn't matter as much as you'd think. In addition, 302 is his combine weight, which he probably shed weight for. I think he'd be fine as a NT. You find a way to get talent on the field, you don't trade it away."

Williams best role is to be a DT in a 43 or DE in a 34, not NT.  Ask pretty much anyone and they will probably say Williams isn't a good NT."

nyjets,33hce7,CrimsonToaster,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:19:30 2015 UTC,Why would you hate a Shane Ray pick? What's wrong with him?
nyjets,33hce7,Cletus_Van_Dam,2,Wed Apr 22 18:13:19 2015 UTC,He's a below average athlete at the NFL level and I think effort is his biggest strength.   He doesn't really create pressure on his own. He is usually the one to clean up the play after someone else creates pressure. I think he's more of a complementary player for a defense than a star that makes an impact by himself.
nyjets,33hce7,CrimsonToaster,0,Wed Apr 22 18:41:51 2015 UTC,"With our line he wouldn't need to be a star, just clean up from the pressure generated by the line.   That being said gimme Beasley"
nyjets,33hce7,woodchips24,2,Wed Apr 22 19:30:49 2015 UTC,Why draft him if you know he won't be that good? Just sign a Jabaal Sheard and draft someone good.
nyjets,33hce7,CrimsonToaster,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:38:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd take one Jabaal Sheard please. Where do you think edge rushers come from?
nyjets,33hce7,Sir_Duke94,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:57:32 2015 UTC,I'd rather take a someone with a Von Miller ceiling (Beasley) than someone that we can get as a free agent. Remember that we could have signed Sheard this offseason and passed.

nyjets,33hce7,TyBerns,9,Wed Apr 22 15:20:31 2015 UTC,"We have Ridley, he is pretty good when he is healthy."
nyjets,33hce7,Sleepy_Man,2,Wed Apr 22 17:27:20 2015 UTC,Ridley is just as good as ivory actually. They are eerily similar.

nyjets,33hce7,Enders_Sack,3,Wed Apr 22 15:54:02 2015 UTC,Oh my god we do not need a Running Back
nyjets,33hce7,DatGrag,2,Wed Apr 22 17:59:58 2015 UTC,We do actually. But there's very good rb to be had in the 2nd or 3rd.
nyjets,33hce7,John_YJKR,3,Wed Apr 22 18:06:23 2015 UTC,"In today's NFL, picking a RB at #6 when you already have three more than serviceable ones on the roster would be a mistake."
nyjets,33hce7,Joe_Pietaro,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:57:43 2015 UTC,But that's a completely different argument than we don't need a rb.
nyjets,33hce7,John_YJKR,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:06:02 2015 UTC,My opinion is that they don't need a RB at all. Ivory is solid and Powell did the job two years ago just fine before being buried on the depth chart with CJ here.
nyjets,33hce7,Joe_Pietaro,2,Wed Apr 22 21:11:59 2015 UTC,All our rb are free agents after this season. Gailey needs a dual threat back for our offense. Ivory and ridley are non factors as receiving backs. Powell is okay at it but not starter quality. We would be wise to take advantage of the talent at rb this draft and pick a rb up in the 2nd or 3rd. I like duke johnson.
nyjets,33hce7,John_YJKR,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:43:59 2015 UTC,Powell is very effective catching the ball out of the backfield and they can address the position later in the draft. RB is such an interchangeable position nowadays & they can even watch the waiver wire during TC to add depth.
nyjets,33hce7,Joe_Pietaro,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:03:20 2015 UTC,He needs a legit two way back like an LT or Spiller. Powell is a good secondary back.
nyjets,33hce7,John_YJKR,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:16:21 2015 UTC,agreed.  still love the guy's heart.
nyjets,33hce7,CosmicWy,2,Thu Apr 23 13:27:08 2015 UTC,We need to fix our offensive line and linebackers in a hurry.   We may in position to draft the hot new qb or an elite wide receiver but we know the positions that need to be overhauled and it would be smart to address them sooner rather then later.
nyjets,33hce7,CoMaBlaCK,2,Wed Apr 22 15:23:30 2015 UTC,Drafting a RB coming off an injury at #6 would be a horrible way for the new regime to start their first draft.
nyjets,33hce7,Shadune,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:55:36 2015 UTC,Remember when somebody told AJ McCarron he would go in the first round?
nyjets,33hce7,akaneel,3,Wed Apr 22 19:22:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah but Gurley actually has the talent for this. His position and injury make him not worth it, but he's talented enough, something McCarron never was"
nyjets,33hce7,woodchips24,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:32:28 2015 UTC,This would be a huge mistake for the Jets. They have a talented & fairly deep backfield right now & can address it in the mid to late rounds. Bilal Powell was wasted last season behind Johnson & deserves more touches and Ivory is a solid number one back.

The Giants have a TON of season ticket holders and while some of those tickets may wind up on the secondary market and there will be more Jets fans at Met Life than there would be at say Gillette, it's only because of proximity to the stadium.

nyjets,33gi5x,arv98s,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:12:05 2015 UTC,"Pocket presence is really really hard to learn. A lot of analysts will tell you that if you have trouble feeling pressure or you overreact to pressure, that part of your game is unfixable. It's incredibly rare to see someone learn how to do either in the NFL if they couldn't do it in college."
nyjets,33gi5x,NannigarCire,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:25:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm, hadn't heard that. Who do you think would teach that though, another qb or a coach?"
nyjets,33gi5x,arv98s,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:35:14 2015 UTC,"Depends on what the team hires. The more i read about NFL Personnel the more i've heard that QB Coaches (and some other positional coaches) are mainly X's and O's guys who are trying to get a coordinator job more than they are mechanical coaches. If that's what we have, then no one's going to be teaching him that and it's going to be up to him to get a personal trainer to teach him or for the team to get a personal trainer to teach him it- if they can. Good Pocket Presence just requires a lot of really high level things, like incredibly good peripheral vision, a high level of understanding of your protection scheme- the schemes combinations with the routes being run and then that sets your internal clock on each play for how long you can stand in the designated throwing spot, an understanding of pass rushing angles and which gaps the rushers are trying to hit and how they're planning on doing that. It's a lot of shit.   If you ever take a look at draft writers/analysts actual scouting reports you'll usually see them have Pocket Presence as a pass/fail because they immediately drop a prospect below everyone who has passed it if they failed."
nyjets,33gi5x,NannigarCire,0,Wed Apr 22 18:49:38 2015 UTC,Who do you have to teach him? Serious question.
nyjets,33gi5x,NotAModBro,2,Wed Apr 22 14:49:44 2015 UTC,Qb coach and Chan Gailey? Fitzpatrick also seems like a good guy to learn from.
nyjets,33gi5x,arv98s,0,Wed Apr 22 15:08:25 2015 UTC,"But usually when you have a backup that you intend to learn and be your starter eventually, have a good QB to learn from and to watch from. Not saying you guys wont have someone emerge this year. I'm speaking from the recent QB troubles you guys have had. If the trend were to continue for the next couple years he would have no one to really watch from."
nyjets,33gi5x,NotAModBro,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:45:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't disagree. But I would hope that our qb coach and Gailey could develop a young qb."

nyjets,33gi5x,zleik,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:35:41 2015 UTC,"Mannion is my favorite non-1st round QB. However, because of his unstable pocket presence, the Jets weak O-line will run him out of the league within 5 years. Unless he finds refuge in Arizona"

A lot of people are saying that this is more of a 7-9 or an 8-8 team, but last year when we went 4-12, seven of those games were lost by 7 points or less. Not to mention the Chicago game was lost by 8. If we had this years secondary last year, and we took seven touchdowns away (which I'm not saying is an easy thing) we could've had a completely different record.

nyjets,33fnqf,rental99,14,Wed Apr 22 03:20:31 2015 UTC,I don't think we sweep the bills. They destroyed us last year and with Rex calling the Blitzes I can see those games being very difficult. Sorry to be a downer but I think we go 7-9 or 8-8. We just came off a 4-12 season lets not get to far a head of ourselves. Look for progress.
nyjets,33fnqf,Dacious96,5,Wed Apr 22 03:37:08 2015 UTC,"To be fair, lots of our games last year were lost in pretty absurd ways. Plus plenty of high drafting teams have gone on to have success the following year and make pretty massive turnarounds quickly."
nyjets,33fnqf,McStrauss,2,Wed Apr 22 03:50:07 2015 UTC,"True a lot of games were close, but good teams finish games and find ways to win. I don't like making predictions with a first year head coach especially one that is inheriting a team with bad QB play. I like Bowles and think he was a great hire, but until i see results I'm not going to say we can easily get to double digit wins."
nyjets,33fnqf,Dacious96,2,Wed Apr 22 03:58:50 2015 UTC,Fitz is going to be the starter and we have a legit secondary. Those were our two biggest issues. Fitz limits turnovers and manages games well. He finished 9th in qb rating last season. He's not the answer but he's a big improvement.
nyjets,33fnqf,John_YJKR,2,Wed Apr 22 07:08:34 2015 UTC,"The question is what level offense can Chan Gailey produce?  People say a lot of nice things about him, but I don't recall Buffalo's offense being particularly intimidating.  Ryan pretty much crushed it 5 times to 1 loss."

I have us losing both to the pats, but winning in all of the games in the ""weaker"" part of the schedule. If you want, swap one of those games with a pats W. We start 1-3, but then go 9-3 to close out. It's not going to be easy, but we can do it... even with Eugene @ QB. Edit: The trip overseas is somewhat balanced by the bye week following (though i generally dislike early byes, and the ""away"" game @ Giants."

But what you're suggesting is a curse, which you're obviously allowed to believe in, but there's no logical way to claim that we're losing a game because of a curse. It's fair if you said something like, ""Well Chip Kelly can scheme up mismatches for our defense"", but just bringing up a record like that is for nothing more than entertainment."
nyjets,33fnqf,sameolejets,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:23:15 2015 UTC,"On what basis do you presume the Jets will sweep the Bills?  Because Ryan will forget how to coach a defense?  Because football is not based on talent & training, but the ""law of averages""?  That the Bills swept us twice last year, the second game without even a formal practice, so the Jets are due two wins???  Why presume a weakened Patriots team will sweep the Jets?"
nyjets,33fnqf,TyBerns,3,Wed Apr 22 08:53:36 2015 UTC,7-9 and 8-8? Really? Look at our roster....were at least going 9-7 this year. Highest will be 10-6. Still think were getting a wildcard spot this year
nyjets,33fnqf,thejjar,2,Wed Apr 22 11:20:40 2015 UTC,I'm optimistic too but 9-7 lowest 10-6 highest is way too small of a range.  There's way too many variables including just bad luck in games.
nyjets,33fnqf,Bynie,2,Wed Apr 22 11:44:44 2015 UTC,When's the last time they win two games in a row. I'll def sign up for this scenario
nyjets,33fnqf,Superjam83,2,Wed Apr 22 03:43:09 2015 UTC,"The games you have listed as a win are must wins. I think we can beat the Eagles because we are home and they are still uncertain of their QB. We see tough QBs on the road in Romo, Manning, Luck, and Brady so nothing is certain there. That middle section squared off is the chunk of the season that we need to win. However, the thing that worries me is that if the Jets start 1-4, winds of controversy will be a swirling."
nyjets,33fnqf,sameolejets,-1,Wed Apr 22 06:03:49 2015 UTC,"I think we can beat the Eagles because we are home and they are still uncertain of their QB.   Week three?  Bradford is going to play lights out.  The ideal match would be that he gets injured, and we face Sanchez."
nyjets,33fnqf,HaroldSax,2,Wed Apr 22 09:04:17 2015 UTC,"Here's mine, and I'll just put it in here instead of making a new thread about it since this is a good topic for it!   Cleveland - Win.  Colts - Loss. Eagles - Loss. Dolphins - Loss. Redskins - Win. Patriots - Loss. Raiders - Win. Jaguars - Win. Bills - Loss. Texans - Win. Dolphins - Win. Giants - Loss. Titans - Win. Cowboys - Loss. Patriots - Loss. Bills - Loss.   Final record: 7-9.   I will say, I am not super duper knowledgeable, but I don't think we sweep the Bills. They destroyed us last season with Uncle Rico throwing the ball around, I don't see their offense slowing down with Harvin and McCoy entered into the mix. I believe we lose the London game just out of sheer pessimism, but beat them at home. The Giants were very, very injured last year so with a possibly healthy team they could have a fairly high powered offense.  The games that I think could swing in our favor are London, Bills @ Jets, a Pats upset, and maybe the Giants which would put us at 11-5 and that is way reaching, but that's the best I can see for us which isn't so bad.  Realistically I see us anywhere between 6-10 and 9-7. We were better than 4-12 last year, but not by much, IMO."

nyjets,33fq4w,Rizzmma,7,Wed Apr 22 03:43:02 2015 UTC,"Just wait til the season starts. I don't think McCoy will live up to the hype and Rex will look really bad after getting fleeced big time. McCoy looked downright awful this year, if you actually watched any Eagles games. That O-line worked their asses off for him. The Bills line is pretty atrocious. I expect 3.2 ypc from McCoy, about 1000 yards and 12 TDs. I think we're tied at RB, believe it or not.   We win at WR with Marshall, Decker and Kerley, all proven to be at least average.  Sammy Watkins will regress. People think he's the next big thing, but once again, he failed the eye test for me. He doesn't have ideal size and I didn't think he ran routes as well as he was hyped up to be able to. I see Watkins reaching 50 catches/700 yards or so. Look at his game log, he was absolutely shut down against any competent secondary. It's no coincidence that the Jets and Vikings wanted to re-do their secondaries this offseason, not to mention that the Dolphins and Jets shut him down once they figured him out in the second division game. Robert Woods is a nice receiver though, I like his potential as a #3.  http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/gamelog/_/id/16725/sammy-watkins  They clearly trump us in the linebacker department, but the difference is we may have a 1st round pick joining us there and they don't have a 1st this year.  At every other position, I think we're even barring a Geno Smith break out."
nyjets,33fq4w,jetsfan07,0,Wed Apr 22 03:58:03 2015 UTC,"Sammy wasn't really shut down as much, but Orton and our OC decided not to target him when he was matched up on good corners even though he beat them"
nyjets,33fq4w,Canzalone9,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:38:15 2015 UTC,"We'll see what happens this season, but do you really believe the OC, who knows he was playing for his job, saw Sammy Watkins at practice every day and said,""We don't need to throw to him"" without good reason?  That's about as optimistic as Jets fans blaming Geno's failures on a lack of weapons. Is it possible? Sure. But I doubt it's the case."
nyjets,33fq4w,jetsfan07,0,Wed Apr 22 13:48:48 2015 UTC,I think most of it was Orton but one of the bills writers did a breakdown showing Watkins beating revis multiple times but Orton throwing the other way
nyjets,33fq4w,Canzalone9,3,Wed Apr 22 13:58:08 2015 UTC,"I don't get it either. Just looking in the prediction thread on /r/nfl, everyone seems to think that the Bills will go ~10-6 while we are being predicted at ~6-10. The Bills lose their head coach and QB who brought them to their first winning season in ten years and replace them with a head coach who's known for neglecting offense and they're still better than us by >4 games?  Trying to be as unbiased as possible, I think they're even with us. Last year 4-12 was our floor. Hell, we had guys off the street starting in our secondary and our #1 WR for half the season was Jeremy Kerley. While the Bills have an elite RB on their team now, they get to go against our line and the Mia's line for 4 games. The team that'll do better is the team that will figure out their QB situation first and I don't trust Rex to do any favors for Ej and company."

RB: Ivory, Johnson Ridley vs West, Crowell  Before we went to our 4th string Center (-2/10, would not recommend doing in the middle of the season) our rookie RBs were pretty dominant. Both of them had over 4 ypc at some point. Then we lost Alex Mack, and with him our entire run game.  CB?  Revis, Cromartie and Skrine vs Haden, Trammon Williams and K'Waun Williams.  You've got the edge in household names, but how much do these guys have left in the tank? Pettine's revamped our secondary into one of the better ones in the league. I also question your depth. Gilbert turned on near the end of the season (after looking like hot buttered garbage) and Desir shut Kelvin Benjamin down. Not terrible for our rookies.  Edit: to fix missing people"

nyjets,33e1sk,LennyLongshoes,-2,Tue Apr 21 22:34:12 2015 UTC,"Bowe's been battling that finger injury and is supposedly back to full health. He also played second fiddle to Jamaal Charles.  Hartline could possibly be a victim of Bill Lazor's offensive scheme. More short, quick routes to try and build tempo. Before Lazor showed up, Hartline was a fine receiver.   Disirregardless, Decker had a down year last year as well. And how well will Marshall play without Alshon Jeffery lining up opposite him? I don't think the WR comparison is as lopsided as you interpret, but then again we're fans of different teams."

nyjets,33e1sk,Brokewood,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:00:27 2015 UTC,Decker was injured most of the year last year. Marshall will be fine with Decker lining up across from him and Kerley in the slot.  As for RB even if you wanted to call it a draw the difference is that the Browns had one of the worst running defenses in the league last year and the Jets had a top 5 Run defense.
nyjets,33e1sk,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:28:41 2015 UTC,No argument there. I give the Jets the edge on DL.   But don't forget we have a top 3 OL. That's why I have it as a wash. What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?

nyjets,33ewcx,latman,2,Tue Apr 21 23:38:29 2015 UTC,If we don't draft a WR because of the Brandon Marshall trade that would be stupid. Go BPA if it's a WR 10 times out of 10.
nyjets,33ewcx,ThreeCranes,3,Wed Apr 22 00:45:40 2015 UTC,"I'd take Shane Ray, a speedy edge rusher with our defense will make our defense a force to reckon with and lets be honest this is going to be a defensive team for the next two years.    As for Cooper in the short term he will cause problems as the receiving corps as the other recivers will complain about not getting enough passes(this is not above Brandon Marshall). Also we have Geno Smith and Ryan Fitzpatrick we aren't going to be throwing the ball a lot anyway. Finally I'm just not that crazy about Amari Cooper,he is polished but thats about it."
nyjets,33ewcx,CrimsonToaster,2,Wed Apr 22 00:45:15 2015 UTC,Ray is a below average NFL athlete.   Gailey runs a lot of 3 WR sets. The possibility of WRs complaining about touches being a factor in your drafting is questionable.

nyjets,33ddgh,otomotopia,10,Tue Apr 21 17:11:59 2015 UTC,Completely agree. Namath is a legend but it was 1968. Like we've been in complete disarray for almost 50 years? I wouldn't say CBS put the frustration in words at all. They put the popular opinion before the draft in words.

nyjets,33ddgh,enjoyyoself,9,Tue Apr 21 19:44:20 2015 UTC,"The circlejerk about Pennington on this subreddit is bothersome.  He's a great guy, however he was an okay mediocre QB. Most mediocre okay QBs who never throw the ball over 20 yards down the field will also have a high completion percentage.  The only reason other QBs like that don't exist is because they'd be replaced. Pennington at his best was pretty good, and most of the rest of the time he was a serviceable game manager. The dude literally NEVER threw the ball past 15 yards, and when he did it was often incomplete. 5 yard dump passes padded his completion percentage. I'd like to see what his completion percentage is for balls 20+ yards compared to other QBs."

I don't see a chance of a trade between the Eagles and Jets but no one's really seen what he can do. I think the reason Chips getting all these quarterbacks stock piled is so he can get rid of them to quarterback needy teams to land Mariota. Chip probably just wants to keep either Sanchez or Bradford to start while they groom Mariota a little. So Barkley and either Sanchez or Bradford would be on the trade/chopping block."
nyjets,33ddgh,the_swimsuit_edition,3,Tue Apr 21 18:21:15 2015 UTC,absolutely not. did you watch the Eagles game he played in? so so so bad.
nyjets,33ddgh,KingMalcolm,3,Tue Apr 21 18:35:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly.   game he played in   He played one game and had 300 yards and four picks which was two years ago. 300 yards 4 INTs is better than 5 yards, with 3 INTs (Geno against Buffalo).   Give him a chance, he's two years removed from that and two off-seasons in. I'm not saying sign him to a 5 year contract. But see what the kid can do on a one year? Sit him behind Fitzmagic and Smith. I'd wager he's as good, if not better than Simms. I've liked having Simms be he should see what he can do somewhere else.   EDIT: looked at the wrong stat line :/ He was 17/26 with 158 yards and 1 INT against the Giants. Still better than some of Geno's games."

nyjets,33ea2v,td2910,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:44:31 2015 UTC,"I think he will develop more, but one thing he needs to work on is blocking. From all indications early in OTAs, he's been the first one in and the last one out working on catching passes. Gailey's system and the added weapons should get him better looks, but he's gotta be able to stay on the field. The caveat with anyone on the receiving corps is QB play, but I expect him to develop further and make a difference in the red zone with Marshall. I think he will turn out to be a great draft pick for us."

nyjets,33ea2v,Rugger11,5,Tue Apr 21 21:32:11 2015 UTC,"His ""drop"" issue was blown out of proportion last year. He had a couple easy ones which is more of a mental thing with easing into the pro game but he actually had one of the best catch ratios in the league. I can look it up again, but it was surprising, he had a better catch ratio than allot of other good tight ends.  I do agree with you that I don't think this is the ""putting it all together"" year. I see it as a step forward, but not all the way there. Then again, our qb issue is the monkey wrench in that one."

nyjets,33eu3h,zleik,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:53:53 2015 UTC,"You're last sentence proves you are very misinformed, the system Jamies comes from is more complex than a lot of NFL teams, where Mariota comes from a MUCH simpler system where there are very very little progressions"
nyjets,33eu3h,i_wannatalktosamson,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:14:35 2015 UTC,"Watch the tape. Marcus will make it from option 1-4 from one end of the field to the next like a pro. Jameis was in a pro style offense, you are correct, but was not forced to really get past options 1 and 2. His guys either got open or he'd force it in to his first options. See his INT stats go up, because Kelvin Benjamin to Rashad Greene was a significant drop off."
nyjets,33eu3h,zleik,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:39:07 2015 UTC,"Yes because he had very limited talent around him going thought his film I saw 5-6 INT that weren't on him, and Mariotas system is designed for little to no turnovers same as Genos was at WVU"
nyjets,33eu3h,i_wannatalktosamson,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:09:53 2015 UTC,"yes,  every pac 10 coach who has faced mariota and has commented on him has stated that he has the tools to be a very good nfl qb. moreover there are numerous NFL coaches and executives who consider Mariota to be an excellent QB prospect - is any of this actually news to you?"
nyjets,33eu3h,MongoJazzy,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:46:09 2015 UTC,"""Tools to be a good QB"" and ""sure thing"" are very different statements"
nyjets,33eu3h,tgrabowy717,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:23:51 2015 UTC,"different people always have different opinions regarding the prospective value of draft picks.  If that concept is difficult for you to grasp then I can see where you might be coming from.  Furthermore people have different opinions of what a ""sure thing"" is.  To many people a ""sure thing"" is somebody who has all the tools to become a good NFL QB - in other words, that player is sure to be a good NFL player.  To other people ""sure thing"" might mean a guaranteed future pro bowler.   So to you those things might be ""very different"" but to me they aren't - it all depends on how you define those terms.  Who cares  anyway?  1 week to the draft is all that matters."
nyjets,33eu3h,MongoJazzy,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:29:36 2015 UTC,That is very very far from the truth
nyjets,33eu3h,tgrabowy717,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:16:55 2015 UTC,No actually it is very very accurate.
nyjets,33eu3h,MongoJazzy,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:46:47 2015 UTC,"There is no way Mariota is a ""sure thing"""
nyjets,33eu3h,tgrabowy717,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:53:57 2015 UTC,Mariota is an excellent prospect. a Heisman award winner who has been extnsively evaluated and many people who have evaluated him think he will be good NFL qb.  So there are many people who disgree w/u and think that MM is a sure thing.
nyjets,33eu3h,MongoJazzy,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:23:57 2015 UTC,"No one is anymore. There is no way Jameis is a sure thing. Watch Russell Wilson in college, Marcus is a very similar QB, just taller, and slightly faster"
nyjets,33eu3h,zleik,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:04:33 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say Winston is a sure thing. I'd say he's a better prospect than Mariota
nyjets,33eu3h,tgrabowy717,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:11:46 2015 UTC,"well you're throwing around the ""sure thing"" tag."
nyjets,33eu3h,zleik,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:19:14 2015 UTC,Mongojazzy called Mariota a sure thing. I said he wasn't. That's it

nyjets,33f10p,clerkzz,2,Wed Apr 22 00:50:30 2015 UTC,Probably will go up as games get closer. Mid June individual tickets go on sale.

nyjets,33f3y2,anthonysciotto,2,Wed Apr 22 00:49:30 2015 UTC,"There's no waiting list. There used to be, and every year they'd send me a postcard telling me that I barely moved up the list. Then when they opened the new stadium, tickets became available for me."
nyjets,33f3y2,JGoodman4President,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:45:15 2015 UTC,"there are non-PSL seats in the 300 level...i forget which section it is.  I requested info about this section a few weeks ago, wanted to order 2 seats and it came out to $1004 combined....so if you are looking at 4 seats it will probably come out to around $500 or so a seat.  Your best bet is to go on the Jets site, start here and request some info about it.  Hopefully this helped a bit! Good luck!"
nyjets,33f3y2,hottsh0t11,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:06:52 2015 UTC,I got mine fairly easily starting last year. Mine are 300 level on the goal line and are only $500 for the season and there's no PSL. Just check out the site and you should get an email or call back by an account manager fairly quickly
nyjets,33f3y2,anthonysciotto,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:17:39 2015 UTC,"Here's your best bet: 8 of you buying 4 seats in the cheapest seats, which are $50/seat per game.  $200/per game * 10 Games = $2,000  $25/per game * 10 Games = $250 (parking, though you can't legally drive, you could sell the passes on stubhub).  This works out to $250/person, before parking. The Jets offer payment plans, which are 4 month plans, meaning you'd have to each come up with $62.50/month.  If the Jets make you get the parking passes, which would be insanity, but so would drafting Vernon Gholston, you would then be on the hook for $281.25/each, making your monthly total ~ $70/each for the four month plan.  The $50 seats are in the end zones in the upper deck but do not include the first few rows. They were the original seats that I had and I liked them (I still sit up there, just in the front row of the section, which is $65 a ticket), but the view is really good as it gives you an all-22 look at the field, and if you sit on the side of the field with 350/301 behind the uprights you get sun all game.  EDIT: Formatting"
nyjets,33f3y2,anthonysciotto,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:51:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the info man. It really helps. Is there any shot you can explain this though, primarily the last bullet point. My friend sent it to me and he's saying its $243 for the seat per season but I'm not sure. Do you know anything about this?"
nyjets,33f3y2,anthonysciotto,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:59:22 2015 UTC,"PSLs are only applicable to the lower and middle seating bowl, if you're looking for the cheapest seats available, that won't apply to you.  Essentially the PSL is a fee that's tacked on to the seat itself, basically it's the ticketholder paying for his ""right"" to buy the seat. It's how they funded the stadium (or a portion of it). Again though, the upper bowl seats are exempt from this fee."
nyjets,33f3y2,Carl_O,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:27:25 2015 UTC,"so the $243 is the PSL fee, which doesn't apply to the upper seats."
nyjets,33f3y2,rbart65,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:16:17 2015 UTC,"Correct. There are no PSLs attached to any seat in the 300 level. The $243 dollar fee you're looking at would be attached to a seat in the endzone mezzanine on a 15 year PSL plan. However, buying a 300 level seat gets you out of dealing with PSLs."

That being said, if he and Marshall make as formidable a duo as we all hope and expect, he won't be going anywhere. He's a hard worker that seems to mesh well with all sorts of situations, and I applaud him for keeping his head in the game last year despite going from Peyton to Geno (only a season catching ducks from Tebow could give a man that type of resolve)  I do however hope that we go Cooper or White if given a shot at either. The starters at wideout are great, but beyond Kerley Marshall Decker the depth chart is lacking. Look at what Green Bay does at the position for example, keep on bringing in talent at the position to make a team strength a suddenly dominate unit."

Starting towards the end of Sanchez's days, our receiving core was already really deprived of talent, Kerley is good but he should never be your biggest threat. For a long time it was easily our team's biggest need. That's why one of the best parts of this offseason for me was Brandon Marshall. Seeing a Jet receiver make this list made me that for the first time in a while we are gonna have a real receiving core, with Decker at #2 and our once biggest threat of Kerley in the slot."

nyjets,339drf,sameolejets,0,Tue Apr 21 05:05:24 2015 UTC,Yah but even Plax was a stiff...the whole argument of this discussion is we have never (outside of 2010) provided any of our QBs with actual NFL caliber WRs
nyjets,339drf,Realistik84,1 point,Tue Apr 21 12:09:49 2015 UTC,I'd argue its contemptible to put Burress in the company of those other receivers.  Burress made a Superbowl winning catch and had some good years with the Steelers.  Burress was the #1 performer out of all those stiffs.  It wasn't like Holmes racked up many more TDs that year than Burress.  Burress did more for the Jets than Keller did in his last two years with the Jets.
nyjets,339drf,sameolejets,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:28:39 2015 UTC,"Burress was a shell of himself since he got out of prison.  He literally probably was running in a 5.1-5.3 40 time range.

He was very effective in the red zone...hell he was 6'5 and always had good hands...but he was never an elite receiver, not even a very good...probably what falls in the category of pretty good...  nonetheless, just because he was good in the red zone doesnt cange my stance.

nyjets,339y1e,LennyLongshoes,25,Mon Apr 20 20:39:59 2015 UTC,"The team is sticking together which is the best thing. I'm sure they're all right but they aren't letting Rex make Jace look like a sulky little bitch, because he isn't. I'm fired up that one of our young draft picks is speaking out about professionalism and getting backed up by the veterans he plays alongside.  Gonna be a lot different under Bowles, whoever was slacking before won't have the room to now. Bowles is new, he has no ties to any of these players and he isn't here to be their best friend. It already has the feel of a much more old school hard nosed regime.   Not saying Bowles is gonna rule with an iron fist but I feel like this regime is gonna be heavily based on accountability, respect and hard work. Arizona players loved him but unlike Rex it didn't seem like it was because of how pally he was with the players, they genuinely respected him. Some of the messages from his previous players said it all to me.  (touch wood) It's a good time to be a jet fan. This change was needed. I feel i'm repeating myself across threads but i'm genuinely excited."
nyjets,339y1e,LDYo,8,Mon Apr 20 20:48:46 2015 UTC,"I think the big difference is that Bowles actually played in this league. He can be a demanding, hard-nosed coach but guys will still respect him, since he's been there before."
nyjets,339y1e,McStrauss,7,Mon Apr 20 21:38:25 2015 UTC,Glad to hear someone step up and back Jace's comments. There was no need for Rex to talk crap about Amaro for the second time. I hope to the football Gods that Amaro goes off on the Bills when they play each other.
nyjets,339y1e,enjoyyoself,-12,Mon Apr 20 21:09:00 2015 UTC,Hopefully Bowles has already chewed Amaro out for his stupid comments which are completely detrimental to what Bowles is looking to do.  Amaro seems like a pretty decent TE but yapping about a former HC who is now an opposing HC is very very stupid and counterproductive.  Plus Amaro hsan't earned the right to talk trash about any NFL HC.   Presumably Coach Bowles has already addressed the situation w/this young fool.
nyjets,339y1e,MongoJazzy,4,Tue Apr 21 00:03:28 2015 UTC,Amaro was answering a direct question and showing his enthusiasm for the new coaches. Its Rex who can't shut up about Amaro.

Amaro is a 2d yr man who needs to focus on becoming a good NFL TE and keep his foolish opinins regarding former and opposing HCs to himself. Yapping about Rex Ryan is stupid and counterproductive to the Jets.  Coach Bowles needs to tell this fool to keep his mouth shut.

Rex did some great things on our defence but he never saw the full picture. I think Bowles is defence heavy too but he seems much more aware of the bigger picture and has brought in the personnel to help him. This will run much more like the finely tuned machine we've needed for years (touch wood, here's hoping)"
nyjets,338p5h,LDYo,5,Mon Apr 20 15:45:00 2015 UTC,I like rex as well. But his comments the past 2 weeks have confirmed my suspicion from 18 months ago. He felt the team was going a different direction and like he had no say or control so he quit trying. He lost his swagger and was clearly not rex anymore. That's why there was no discipline and why the young players weren't showing much heart at times. Rex is only effective when he can be himself. He is a players coach. For his method to work he needs his swagger and outrageous behavior in order to inspire his players. I agree he was too defense focused. He truly believed all we needed was a great run game and great defense to win.

nyjets,338p5h,vbar44,2,Mon Apr 20 20:14:46 2015 UTC,I believe him. But I think it makes him look bad. To me he's admitting he kinda gave up and didn't try very hard. That's not a good look.
nyjets,338p5h,John_YJKR,2,Mon Apr 20 20:45:17 2015 UTC,"Rex spent most of last season saying, ""This loss was my fault.  It's on me.""  But I think u/John_YJKR is right that Rex also seems to be retroactively saying he gave up because he felt trapped by Woody and Idzik."

nyjets,338p5h,Neckwrecker,4,Wed Apr 22 02:40:35 2015 UTC,I think the prime example is Geno's missing that meeting last year before the Chargers game and still starting. I think that set an ominous precedent.
nyjets,338p5h,Superjam83,10,Mon Apr 20 15:56:06 2015 UTC,"I was gonna say something like Peyton Manning would never get benched for missing a meeting, but then I realized he would never do that and that's part of what makes him Peyton. So that would never even happen."
nyjets,338p5h,TheRealJamesHoffa,5,Mon Apr 20 17:51:56 2015 UTC,"rex turned this into something it did not need to be. amaro did not make a pointed comment directly about rex, he didn't call anyone out. the lack of accountability was something we saw and heard about last year whether it was davis talking about practice, vick being unprepared to play, or geno missing meetings. it's very evident that there was a lack of focus and preparation last season. and if we weren't hearing about it from the media, we saw it in the form of pre-snap penalties and lack of execution on the field. rex can play the revisionist history game all he wants, it can't change the truth. rex took us all on a great (albeit winding) ride, but it's over now. let him concentrate on the bills."
nyjets,338p5h,td2910,2,Mon Apr 20 21:02:36 2015 UTC,"Speaking from the other side of the fence here, Amaro lit the match. Whether Ryan put it out with a fire hose is a different story.  On a somewhat related note, I'm curious to know what Ryan was about to say when he cut himself off mid quote. He said something to the effect of ""That kid's [cuts self off]..""   I'm curious if he was going to call him soft or a scumbag or something lol"
nyjets,338p5h,mid90s,2,Tue Apr 21 18:58:22 2015 UTC,"One comment to make as a Bills fan and I'll be on my way..  Demario Davis has developed into a really good football player, and has always kept it classy. This dude has been hustling his butt off and letting his play do the talking for the past few years and I definitely respect that.  I don't think he was taking a shot at Rex Ryan. I don't know the guy so I can't tell you what he thinks or feels but it doesn't seem like his style. I saw that quote as Davis speaking for the team when he said ""we"" and not the coaches.  To me, that's a really good thing. I viewed that as the moment that Davis was stepping up as a leader and making it clear to both the veteran guys and the rookies that losing is unacceptable and it's especially unacceptable if you're not working as hard as the next guy.  Just my 2cents, I'm sure Bowles is a good coach but I think true accountability will come from players like Davis that have the respect and trust of coaches keeping their units in check.  Last but not least...if Rex was truly being pushed out the past few years the way he claims..it's possible he was trying not to bring anybody down with him."
nyjets,338p5h,mid90s,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:10:43 2015 UTC,"Very true.  You know what, he really was being pushed out, which if true, he should just have been fired.  I guess I can understand Rex being sour after the way he was handled."

You can throw all sorts of rationale at me and harp on draft picks and value and other buzz words that make a whole lotta sense in the bigger picture, but it'll fall on deaf ears. My want to win is irrational. My love for the Jets is irrational."

Idc what the situation is, I want the Jets to win every game. I will never root for my team to lose, because 11-5 or 3-13 every loss hurts the same. When this team loses it ruins my entire day, I sulk around with a pit in my gut. I understand the argument, but have a draft pick up a few spots really doesn't make a difference as long as your team can scout. Just look at past drafts."
nyjets,33drwk,Itsascrnnam,0,Tue Apr 21 20:50:53 2015 UTC,"All I'm saying is if you want your team to win as many games as possible then you should want them to lose a few strategic ones that make more future wins possible. It's not really arguable  I I get the feeling you're describing, I get it too. But succeeding is about delaying gratification to get more gratification that's what success usually means.  For a smart team that practices logical decision making. Not a team that panders to our baser instincts"
nyjets,33drwk,maccam21,0,Tue Apr 21 21:09:22 2015 UTC,"My love of them is irrational too, which is why I want them to get better at all costs, even short term losses in a lost season.  Also the offseason was awesome so I'm happy."

nyjets,33drwk,Sir_Duke94,8,Tue Apr 21 21:38:03 2015 UTC,You realize we would have the 4th pick right not the 2nd which changes your entire argument.
nyjets,33drwk,maccam21,0,Tue Apr 21 19:30:13 2015 UTC,You have to extend the logic. Those of us who wanted them to lose to the titans also wanted the same sort of back up brigade to run against the dolphins.
nyjets,33drwk,Sir_Duke94,-2,Tue Apr 21 20:21:19 2015 UTC,Obviously the same logic applies to the dolphins game. Winning 2 of our last 3 after that shitty season was a disaster.
nyjets,33drwk,lispboy,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:22:56 2015 UTC,"Ok and then there's the logic that Rex is coaching for his next job. If he tanks the rest of the season why would he get another job since he ""gave up"". Also Idzik was fighting for his job as well so why would he tank the team?  I get why fans wanted us to lose those games but there are a TON of different factors as to why it is a bad idea. For starters a lot of players have performance based pay which means they need to be on the field to get their money. Which free agents would want to come to a team that's open to tanking and playing starters when a lot of contracts are performance based?   Additionally why would management do this to the players? These players worked hard all off-season and deserve the right to go out there and try to win if that is what they want to do. If management tells them they can't play why would they want to be a Jet because that is certainly a meaningless term since playing like a Jet means tanking for a draft pick.  No team openly tanks by putting in backups teams tank by trading away their best players in order to gain youth and an under-performing roster so they CAN'T win.   The Sabres are the perfect example of a tank job. They gutted their entire roster and played the season with a terrible team and it landed them the 2nd pick, but they didn't sit their starters because what kind of message would that send to every other player out there? Nobody would want to join that roster because at any sign that the Sabres were going perform poorly then the player has to think are they going to bench me because they want to tank?"
nyjets,33drwk,Rugger11,2,Tue Apr 21 20:57:44 2015 UTC,I could never root for a team that loses on purpose.
nyjets,33drwk,Rugger11,2,Tue Apr 21 21:05:09 2015 UTC,"Selling the season for the future is never the correct choice. You lose credibility to the fanbase, coaches, and players, essentially saying its ok to give up if it means the chance for a better future. This is a dangerous way of thinking. Where do you draw the line? When does it stop? When does it start? Do you start tanking at 2-10? How about 4-8? It is telling players that the organization is ok with not putting it all out on the field given the situation. Even just looking at a game by game basis. What if  you are down by 3 scores, and have that way of thinking in your head? Players could think, ""well, we tried, all is lost now though."" What if they could have rallied and made a comeback? Now you just added a 1 to the L column instead of at least a chance of moving that 1 to the W.  Noting is a sure thing in this league. Yes, a higher pick gives you more options but does not mean it will pan out. A first rounder can be a bust just as easily as a stud."
nyjets,33drwk,NoOne6,-4,Tue Apr 21 20:20:25 2015 UTC,"The line was clear. We won 2 games and had 3 left to play. Losing out is great for the team.  Winning any games, especially against the titans, is objectively worse.   Yes, a higher pick gives you more options but does not mean it will pan out. A first rounder can be a bust just as easily as a stud.   This is the anti-logic fallacy that makes me insane. Of course nothing is a sure thing. Hell, the whole team could die in a plane crash.  You have to maximize your chance at success.  I fall down a well tomorrow if I go outside, it doesn't mean I should make the objectively worse decision of not going to my job and getting paid.  This whole debate is characterized by faulty thinking and that's why it gets me so riled up."
nyjets,33drwk,Rugger11,5,Tue Apr 21 20:29:53 2015 UTC,"Winning any games at that point is subjectively worse. There, I did it too. Making your opinion bold does not magically give it more validity. Your way of thinking puts draft position at a higher value than other metrics such as final record, entertainment value of games, or pride. Different things hold different value for different people.  And my point is not an anti-logic fallacy, just stating facts. You are taking my point and twisting it, taking it to the extreme. Sheldon was drafted at 13. Five other defensive players were picked before him and he was the best defensive player in the draft. He is the only player, offensive or defensive, to have been elected to a pro bowl in the top 15 of that draft and one of two defensive players drafted in the entire first round to have made it.  Lets look at quarterbacks. And I'm not going to go into players like JaMarcus. Lets look at Alex Smith, who Mariota has been compared to. Smith was the first overall pick and what looked like a great prospect. Has he been terrible or even bad? No. Especially over the past few years. Is he great or elite? Not by any stretch of the imagination. Would he be worth tanking for? No. Not saying that is the path Mariota will go down, but when you are playing a game where the goal is to win games, it does not make sense to intentionally lose them for the chance at getting someone when there are so many other factors involved.  And you completely ignored my point about it setting a bad precedent for players. Any coach or front office who does that to a team will immediately loose credibility from their players. How can they put everything on the line trying to get that win one day to be told they are going to intentionally lose the next. I don't know if you have ever played any sort of sports before, but that would not fly. I played college rugby and gave it everything I had. The year before we got to school, the numbers on the team were dwindling and we had a winless season. My class came in, almost doubling the size of the team. We won our first game in two seasons during that year. Playoffs we out of sight but we played each game as hard as the last. Our last game meant nothing but injured or not, we went out there and played. We left it all out on the field. Even if we had the potential to get the best college recruit if we had lost, that wouldn't have changed a thing. We had passion, drive, and fire. And we took that into the next season. Before you knew it, we turned a winless and one win team to a regular playoff team. I can tell you with 100% certainty, if we were told to take a dive and flop, we would lose that fire and drive and would not perform the same the next season.  EDIT: One last thing. And the thing about this line. Sure, that’s what it is last season. What if this season we need to lose one more for an even better player. What if the year after it is an additional for a better player yet? You set a precident that it is ok to lose if it means getting better talent. When does it stop?"
nyjets,33drwk,John_YJKR,-1,Tue Apr 21 21:17:15 2015 UTC,"I can't believe how often people think saying ""Well the pick might have been a bust anyway"" means ANYTHING.  It's mind blowingly illogical."
nyjets,33drwk,John_YJKR,2,Tue Apr 21 20:30:58 2015 UTC,"The point is you shouldn't be tanking intentionally for a possibility. It isn't a sure thing one way or another. Sure, 2 is much more valuable, but more valuable than the credibility you lose?"

Think of the morale it would have on the players for an organization to tell you that you need to lose.  Football players sacrifice their youth and their health to win football games.  They would be demoralized, dissent and discontent would permeate the locker room.  Telling a team to tank is like telling the players ""you're worthless as you are, I give up on you, just lose so we can replace all of you later.""    THAT'S how you sabotage an entire organization.  Leadership like that has no place in the NFL."

nyjets,33drwk,editnonameedit,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:16:38 2015 UTC,"I felt the exact same way. The short-term picture made no sense to me. It's not like the Titans game was a good or exciting win either, we played really poorly that game and won only because the Titans played worse. We played better in the Patriots and Vikings games, saw progression from a lot of young players in those two games, and still lost to add more talent to the team. Those were like, perfect scenario for me.  If you wanted the Jets to win, that's great for you and all but I would have been pretty cool with getting to 3rd/4th Overall and being able to at least get a good trade going with a team that wanted Leonard Williams."

nyjets,33drwk,ajn19,0,Tue Apr 21 20:23:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed, a higher pick would help it's out immensely. Right now our options are sell the pick or have 5 other teams control our destiny. We could get Cooper,  we could get Beasley,  or mariota,  or Ray,  our white, or Fowler,  or who knows. Having the 2 or even the 4 gives is more control of who we pick.   That being said,  It's a touchy issue.  On one hand losing on purpose isn't great. Definately devalues the team as a whole. Its also not something you can really ask a player or a coach to do. On the other,  it does have it's benefits. Higher draft picks sell for more,  and the difference between the #2 and the #6 is enormous before the draft. We can gain or lose value on draft day with the 6, but the #2 this year holds an almost concrete value.   Overall,  I agree,  but don't try to start shit by saying ""my way is better than yours"". We were doing pretty good this offseason,  let's try not to stir old shit up again. What happened happened,  nothing we can do to change it, no value in talking and arguing about it."
nyjets,33ab2z,IAmA_scientist2,10,Mon Apr 20 22:14:53 2015 UTC,"No, I actually hope they do.  Edit- Marshall is almost 32 years old. We did not get any of the talented crop of WR's last year. It is a position we need, we are in a position to get it and grabbing someone like Cooper would not be a reach as he would also be in the conversation for best player available. We could have a top WR on the roster for 5 years for a fraction of what you would pa someone like Marshall.  If we go through another draft without taking a top prospect WR while it is staring us in the face I will be pissed off."

nyjets,33ab2z,the_furry_stoner,10,Mon Apr 20 22:29:27 2015 UTC,"I want Cooper so bad if he's there. I think Mariota falls past the Titans and the Raiders end up having a very valuable pick. They're the only ones that I can see taking Cooper. I don't want White at 6, though. He's good and has the physical traits but Cooper is a franchise talent. I think he's better than Sammy Watkins. With Marshall's tutelage it could make Cooper better and keep Marshall responsible. I feel like he helped Alshon a lot and that was a part of why he was happy there."
nyjets,33ab2z,games456,5,Mon Apr 20 22:25:57 2015 UTC,"I am right there with you. I want Cooper. White may have a higher ceiling but Cooper is more of a sure thing imo, why take the risk."

nyjets,339ijh,OprahSwagfrey,2,Mon Apr 20 23:11:24 2015 UTC,"UCF student here. Got to see this guy play a few times in person. I don't get the 1st round hype. Not as fast as that 40 time. Drops more balls than a receiver should. But is a big, fast guy with potential. Wouldn't mind drafting him in 2nd-3rd round."

The ""JETS"" oval is just too meh for me.  I'd love the NY logo used in these concepts: http://i.imgur.com/dnmXNOt.jpg (disregard the Titans throwbacks, for obvious reasons).

nyjets,337f3s,JGand72,7,Tue Apr 21 16:07:57 2015 UTC,Nothing. Personally I think our uniforms are one of the best in the league. Only thing I would change is make the shade of green more similar to the pre-2011 Reebok green instead of the forest green they have right now.
nyjets,337f3s,akaneel,7,Mon Apr 20 12:21:55 2015 UTC,I like everything except the oval.  I would love it if we went back to these helmets.

nyjets,336ipc,Rugger11,9,Mon Apr 20 17:40:09 2015 UTC,"I'm excited to see how Chip Kelly uses Tebow. He's a gimmick, but he could be a good gimmick, just not the way Rex and Sparano used him. When they first got Tebow, I envisioned Tebow and Sanchez lining up next to each other in the shotgun a couple times every game. That would have avoided ""throwing off"" anyone's ""rhythm"", while opening up some new wrinkles in the offense."
nyjets,336ipc,dumbego,9,Mon Apr 20 01:36:24 2015 UTC,"Same, I envisioned something like Tebow and Sanchez lined up, direct snap to Tebow, then Tebow flips it to Sanchez and blocks or something.

nyjets,336ipc,sameolejets,5,Mon Apr 20 06:16:42 2015 UTC,Belichick picked up Tebow as well. People are reading way too much into this signing. There is no reason to think that Kelly even intends for Tebow to make the final roster. He's just being given a shot to do so.
nyjets,336ipc,McStrauss,1 point,Mon Apr 20 07:28:49 2015 UTC,Belichick did not keep Tebow for the final 53 man roster.  I have no problem with a coach interested in taking a look.  My guess is that Kelly got Tebow signed for something other than QB/backup QB.  Its still a waste of time.
nyjets,336ipc,sameolejets,1 point,Tue Apr 21 05:10:17 2015 UTC,What reason is there to think that? We know nothing about why he was signed.
nyjets,336ipc,McStrauss,1 point,Tue Apr 21 06:22:57 2015 UTC,"We know Kelly likes to run spread/pistol formations.  Tebow is useless as a fulltime QB, but if he were kept on the field all the time, say as a 2nd TE, he could block in the pocket, threaten to pass, and do short runs."
nyjets,336ipc,sameolejets,4,Tue Apr 21 21:31:23 2015 UTC,Probably nothing.  It's not like he turned Sanchez into a Juggernaut.  The only way this Tebow move makes any sense is if he totally blew everyone away at his workout and fixed his throwing mechanics.  Either that or he finally gave in and is willing to play a different position.
nyjets,336ipc,Sampetra,3,Mon Apr 20 15:09:23 2015 UTC,He knew that he was a better coach then David Lee.
nyjets,336ipc,Reckless_Vlad,2,Mon Apr 20 13:13:40 2015 UTC,"Nothing. His system elevated Sanchez from below average to average QBR. That's great but still not good enough to start in the league. So he basically wasted his time signing and playing Sanchez when he could have just played Barkley instead. Sanchez's failure is  why Kelly traded for Bradford, whom is henceforth the new Eagles' starter. I don't even think Tebow is as accurate as Sanchez, let alone Bradford. It just seems like Kelly is throwing mud on the wall and seeing what sticks. That's a good strategy but I don't think he knows more about Sanchez and Tebow (i.e. not good enough) that we do."

nyjets,336619,teacht79,6,Sun Apr 19 22:35:22 2015 UTC,Olb is what I'd prefer. Trade down and take olb/wr and scherff.   Ideally I'd like Beasley in 1st and grayson/wr/duke johnson in 2nd and 3rd.
nyjets,336619,John_YJKR,2,Sun Apr 19 23:38:36 2015 UTC,I am a big Duke Johnson fan as well. Would be awesome if he lasted until the 3rd. Not sure he will make it out of the 2nd though
nyjets,336619,mnmnstrd,4,Mon Apr 20 13:06:16 2015 UTC,"My priorities depending on how the boards fall:   Only EDGE players I'm interested in at 6 are Beasley and Fowler. I'd pass on Ray and Gregory this high. I imagine Williams will be off the board by 6, but we may be able to find a trade partner for him if he falls. Williams is very talented but we have other needs and his skill set is too similar to someone like Richardson. If Beasley and Fowler are off the board, I'd target Harold out of Virginia in the second round.  Only WR I would be interested in at 6 is Cooper. His game will translate to he NFL seamlessly and he can play Week 1. I'm scared of taking someone like White at 6. He only produced for a year  in college and doesn't play as fast his 40. I'd rather take Cooper who runs amazing routes and knows how to get open. A 3 WR set of Marshall/Decker/Cooper is easily a top corps in the league. We would finally have legitimate depth in case of injury. We can't allow the whole offense to fall apart like it did last season when Decker got hurt. Stay away from Perriman from UCF at #6. There aren't any other recievers I'd touch this high the in the draft. If we don't take Cooper, I'd like a speed receiver in the middle rounds like Devin Smith, Lockett or Dorsett.  Only scenario I would trade up for would be if TB passes on Winston at #1. He's a QB that could come in and win a battle between Smith/Fitzpatrick and start Week 1. He's worth giving up a 2016 first for in my opinion. There would probably be several teams bidding for the second overall pick from Tennessee, so you would have to be careful to not severely overpay. A franchise QB is extremely valuable but I don't want to risk hamstringing the team in the future if you have to give up several firsts and seconds to get it done. I wouldn't trade up for Mariota, but I wouldn't hesitate to take him if he falls to us at 6. If he falls to 6, I would try shopping him to teams like Chicago, San Diego, or Philadelphia, and see if we could load up with future picks.  I don't like any of the OLs at 6, but I would grab Collins if we are able to move down somewhere in the middle of the first. He could push Giacomini for playing time at RT, and could be the heir apparent for Brick at LT. Guys like Peat and Scherff are also solid targets if we move down. I'd look at tackle prospects rather than guard because we already have a ton of guards on the roster."
nyjets,336619,jetsfan07,3,Mon Apr 20 12:41:01 2015 UTC,"If Williams fell to us, no way we pass on him. I don't care how it gets done, you'd find a way to put Wilkerson, Richardson and Williams on that line all at once, that's not a gift that should be traded away.  That being said, no way he falls to us.  Also, I think our best situation would be Mariota falling to us, we trade down with the Browns for both 1sts, and draft two OL. Then in the second, a OLB. Not many will be happy with this because OL isn't flashy, but it could end up paying off the same way Mangold and D'Brickashaw did."

My #1 suspicion is that Coples has convinced Idzik that HE is the best option to fill that 3-4 OLB pass rusher role. He could cut 10 pounds and play that position at 270 like Demarcus Ware, and we all know he can move. Then we're looking at Richardson, Ellis, and Wilkerson along the line. Both Wilkerson and Richardson are extremely athletic for their size 290+ and will be more disruptive than most 3-4 teams get out of their defensive ends. I'm not tapped into the front office's thinking at all, but this is the only logical explanation I can come up with to justify the Richardson pick.

nyjets,332rcp,CloseCaptioning,-1,Sat Apr 18 23:43:30 2015 UTC,"Nah, my problem wasn't that he sabotaged Rex or spent little money in FA. My problem with Idzik is that he drafted REALLY poorly he had 1 consistent player out of all his picks and missed on 10 of 12 in 2013 with pryor not looking good and amaro looking inconsistent.

Even if he declines a bit because of deterioration of his physical skill set he'll still be among the best corners in the league because his technical skills at corner are so good. There are very few corners I've seen that can read a WR like Revis, athleticism comes more into play for recovery action for a cornerback like catching up with a receiver out of a break or biting on a double move. Revis more often than not sticks to a receiver and stays stuck, he makes it look easy."

nyjets,330228,tgrabowy717,1 point,Sat Apr 18 10:20:40 2015 UTC,"Jets fans in general will boo BPA picks and cheer position of need picks. We needed a saftey and a QB, we already had Wilkerson and Cromartie.  For example, if that ridiculous DT is available when we're up, we should take him just because he's that good. He'd be the BPA by a mile. But if we do, you better believe the organization would get boo'd because he's just adding to our strongest position group.  We also cheer for offense over defensive picks. You better believe we'd cheer for WR White or Cooper, despite the fact that we dont need them, but EDGE rusher Fowler wouldn't get many cheer, despite the fact that we DO need him."
nyjets,330228,otomotopia,2,Sat Apr 18 14:13:06 2015 UTC,"BPA has its limits. One of the those limits is taking a player that plays a position that is currently completely set and the starter is young and will be on your team for the foreseeable future. If we pick Williams the fans would have every right to boo  Especially because he can't play 0 tech anyway, which is the only position in our line that may open soon. He's better suited at 34 DE, where we already have two young studs"

nyjets,32yg86,John_YJKR,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:40:50 2015 UTC,I agree. He is being underrated. Clearly needs time to sit and study the game and improve his skills but I think he could develop into starting caliber after a couple seasons.

In the open ended box about what the Jets need to add to GameDay I wrote a dissertation on fireman ed and why they need to bring him back. when they asked about what deters from my GameDay experience they got a supreme court worthy opinion about why they should get rid of the fireworks after touchdowns (because they're painfully loud in the 300 level and you can't even see them during day games).  After all the answers I've sent back on my surveys I'm shocked they haven't revoked my tickets. Though I am glad that they're interested in making the game a better experience.

nyjets,32ue5t,Tchnique,9,Thu Apr 16 23:48:51 2015 UTC,"Marshall is on the wrong side of 30. You're investing in a #1 receiver for years to come if he's on the board.   I'd prefer an edge rusher. You win with a qb, protecting the qb and getting to the qb. But if Mac and Bowles don't have the confidence that Beasley/Ray/etc may not be an elite outside presence, then it makes sense."
nyjets,32ue5t,rvbcaboose1018,2,Fri Apr 17 01:03:40 2015 UTC,"Its not a bad idea if you think long run.   Marshall will only be here for probably 2 or 3 years. 4 If were lucky and hes consistently good. Decker Probably the same, think 4 years. Kerley another 2-3 years. Long term, having a developed WR1 is huge.   Plus, it gives us 3 big weapons for QBs to throw too instead of just two. Makes it a more promising place for any future QBs. Also helps transition any rookie QBs we might obtain in the future.   The way I see it, Kiper is probably full of shit, but if the Jets do get White or Cooper or even Mariota, i wouldn't be mad. I have to accept that the coaches know more about the teams needs than I do, and trust that their pick is in the best interest of the team."

I mean, are the Bills slightly more talented than the Jets, maybe. It's debatable at best. But I can't see Rex taking them to anything greater than 9-7. I have always maintained he was a terrible in-game coach, horrible talent judge, and poor at developing players. He can get the players to play 110% and is a great scheme guy, but that's a defensive coordinator and not a head coach. I hope we blow them out both times we play them.   They made a great point. At some point during the hiring process the owners and GM looked at Rex, saw the same head coach that got blown out by 30+points in a game their team had 10x more prep time for, and said ""Yeah, that's our guy"". They then watched him win 4 games on the season and decided, man this Jets team that was 11-5 at one point under Rex sure has grown.  I loved Rex, we all did. We all were ready to defend him against everyone but now that we're out of the abusive relationship, we can see how much of a shithead he is. I hope the Bills implode this year."
nyjets,32t49g,Shrimpola_Cola,2,Thu Apr 16 15:13:42 2015 UTC,I thought that maybe Rex had learned from his experience in New York.  But then he traded for Tyrod Taylor to run the wildcat and started talking him up like he's the next Elway.  Whatever.   Geno Smith has the same number of losses against the Bills as Tom Brady.

He'll come into a great roster, take his team close if not all the way in the first year or two or three, then fade into mediocrity."
nyjets,32t49g,LennyLongshoes,2,Thu Apr 16 17:09:19 2015 UTC,An amazing coach on the field? What field were you watching?

And, heck, now he's just cursing out our players in the media because a 2nd year guy noticed that the team wasn't being accountable - and from the quotes I saw, he wasn't even calling out Rex, but rather just making an observation about an issue the team had.

nyjets,32t49g,Realistik84,-2,Thu Apr 16 18:27:26 2015 UTC,That has nothing to do with our discussion. You're deflecting.
nyjets,32t49g,xenonprime,2,Thu Apr 16 20:06:11 2015 UTC,"no he didt - Amaro said ""Guys werent as accountable as they couldve been"" - laying blame on the specific individuals like Pryor and Geno who missed meetings, were late, etc....  NOWHERE does he call out Rex.  Your the drone the media lives off one."

nyjets,32x3x0,matap821,11,Fri Apr 17 13:12:46 2015 UTC,He wasn't good enough to even be on a teams 53 man roster for the entire last season. Why would he be of any help to us?
nyjets,32x3x0,chris_ri,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:17:55 2015 UTC,Rex was able to squeeze six sacks out of Aaron Maybin.  Sam might be total garbage. But being that pass rush is a big need for the Jets and he would come at zero risk he's worth a look.
nyjets,32x3x0,Shrimpola_Cola,2,Fri Apr 17 13:24:37 2015 UTC,Who do you think is better Vernon Gholston or Michael Sam?
nyjets,32x3x0,wishistudiedphysics,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:38:04 2015 UTC,"Tough call.  Gholston did end up getting like 30 tackles, even though I never remember seeing him do anything at all."
nyjets,32x3x0,Shrimpola_Cola,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:50:56 2015 UTC,"Point being, if Rex wasn't able to get the best out of Gholston and he was better than Sam, I doubt the outcome would be different.  It's a very generic comparison but the same rational applies."
nyjets,32x3x0,wishistudiedphysics,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:06:50 2015 UTC,I think Gholston had more of an attitude problem than an ability one. Sam at least wants to Play
nyjets,32x3x0,woodchips24,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:50:34 2015 UTC,"Gholston just didn't have the mentality of a pro football player, that's why he wasn't good. He wasn't really motivated.  Sam however, does."
nyjets,32x3x0,davegarri,0,Fri Apr 17 18:52:17 2015 UTC,30 tackles out of a first round pick is abysmal.

nyjets,32x3x0,Shrimpola_Cola,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:51:21 2015 UTC,I genuinely believe the poor guy had some sort of mental issue lol
nyjets,32x3x0,akaneel,0,Fri Apr 17 14:53:34 2015 UTC,"I'm actually not sure if he got cut because of lack of talent, I think it's more coaches and GMs don't wanna spend half the presser talking about a practice squad member or their 3rd string DE/OLB who played two snaps."
nyjets,32x3x0,G1az3d,-2,Fri Apr 17 16:08:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he's a fix, but he's a role player in a role we need until we find a good, well rounded OLB."
nyjets,32x3x0,Rugger11,3,Fri Apr 17 13:26:07 2015 UTC,"Michael Sam wasn't good enough to make the Cowboys roster after they lost a few linebackers to injury. Everyone wants to say he fell in the draft because of his sexual orientation but the truth of the matter is, he fell because he's not very good."
nyjets,32x3x0,TreSeven,7,Fri Apr 17 14:51:48 2015 UTC,"The only reason why anyone knows his name is because he publicly came out before the draft. Gay, straight, transgender, I don't care what sexual orientation he is. Bottom line is he is not an NFL caliber player. The only reason why he was drafted was because of the media following him and the ""feel good"" story. If he didn't go public with his story, you wouldn't have known his name, he would not have been drafted, and we would not be having this discussion. There are tons of free agents with the same skill level as Sam and to be frank, nothing that should put him above the rest of them. Could he find his way on a team and land on a team's 53? Maybe. It is a long shot and will take much time and effort on his and the coaches' part. Why not give him a shot? It is probably not worth it. I'm not trying to be harsh, but I am sure there is someone with more talent and more upside out there than Sam who will require much less time and effort to get NFL ready."
nyjets,32x3x0,Amoress,4,Fri Apr 17 14:27:29 2015 UTC,"To be fair, he was the SEC DPOY"
nyjets,32x3x0,TreSeven,3,Fri Apr 17 14:56:05 2015 UTC,Unfortunately college success is meaningless in terms of NFL success
nyjets,32x3x0,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:28:55 2015 UTC,"That's true. I'm just saying he'd probably be a story either way, the DPOY in the best conference in college football going in the 7th round"
nyjets,32x3x0,John_YJKR,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:50:11 2015 UTC,"The reason he fell so far is because he was so much in the public eye, imo. SEC DPOY would have gotten him taken in the 3rd/4th round when some team's top prospects all got picked and the coach or GM says fuck it, we'll try to get him up to starter caliber in a year or too. Instead, there would have been too many questions every press conference about your 3rd string DE/OLB because everybody knows his name. I completely understand not wanting to deal with that bullshit."
nyjets,32x3x0,DerNubenfrieken,2,Fri Apr 17 16:06:20 2015 UTC,"But that's not it. Sam's tape isn't good enough. His practices haven't been good enough to keep him on rosters. Sam's size isn't NFL Size. Sam's a tweener with very low starter potential at any point in his career who won't contribute on special teams. He's a role pass rusher who will be one of the worst in his role, and can't help you anywhere else."
nyjets,32x3x0,John_YJKR,3,Fri Apr 17 17:51:45 2015 UTC,"Couldn't stay on an active roster last year. There are better, more experienced olb that are unsigned. We will draft pass rush. I wouldn't waste my time on sam."

nyjets,32x3x0,the_furry_stoner,2,Fri Apr 17 15:03:47 2015 UTC,"I'd be fine with it.  It would be basically zero risk to kick his tires, and he plays a position that is a definite need for the Jets right now.  I don't know if he has what it takes, but they should definitely take a look."
nyjets,32x3x0,CoMaBlaCK,0,Fri Apr 17 13:21:11 2015 UTC,It would be basically zero risk to kick his tires   Except the inevitable media circus
nyjets,32x3x0,McStrauss,3,Fri Apr 17 14:26:56 2015 UTC,You say this as if there won't be a media circus surrounding the team no matter what.
nyjets,32x3x0,JosephLandini,2,Fri Apr 17 14:32:04 2015 UTC,"I mean, it wouldn't hurt. He's been significantly less of a media distraction than everyone thought and maybe he can be coached up to a solid pass rusher. He might not make the roster but we've been stacking LB depth so I'm not opposed."
nyjets,32x3x0,akaneel,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:08:38 2015 UTC,"It seems like we're stacking up on ILBs more than OLBs, and he's the only FA pass rusher I can think of, but then again I don't follow close enough to know a bunch of guys who aren't on rosters."
nyjets,32x3x0,tgrabowy717,2,Fri Apr 17 14:15:45 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be against anybody that improves this team. Does Sam improve the team is the question? If he doesn't then pass.
nyjets,32x3x0,ajn19,2,Fri Apr 17 15:12:39 2015 UTC,He's slow as fuck. Can't really see what he would give us that we don't already have.

nyjets,32x3x0,patricwinn,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:42:01 2015 UTC,Doubt he'll do anything but it can't hurt to try. The only thing is he seems far better suited for 4-3 DE than 3-4 OLB. I don't think he's athletic enough to play standing up
nyjets,32ueq8,Daddym89,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:11:00 2015 UTC,"I think if Cooper, Winston, and Mariota are all gone by the 6th pick, then Shane Ray will come to us, not Beasly. But hell what do I know, I proclaimed Geno our lord and savior just a couple years ago."

nyjets,32ueq8,sharked,0,Fri Apr 17 15:20:53 2015 UTC,I think everybody is way too high on beasly. He's a pure speed pass rusher Without the strength skill or size to do much else. He's horrible tackling and against the run. Just don't think value is there at 6
nyjets,32ueq8,-bangarang,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:40:51 2015 UTC,"Didn't Beasley have the most bench presses out of all OLBs in the draft? Yea he could bulk up and has some work to do, but I think he could be deadly speed rushing behind our D-Line with some coaching"
nyjets,32ueq8,404-UsernameNotFound,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:14:48 2015 UTC,"Yes he did have the most reps for Linebacker and D-line men at the combine.   This guy has the right to his opinion but I Beasley as the best pass rusher and I hope he is there at Number 6 because there is great value in this guy. He isn't bad against the run he constantly faces double teams. He does need to add bulk but so does a lot of the top pass rushers in the draft. Give him a year in an NFL training program/weight room and I'm sure he can get the necessary bulk.   I don't know what this guy is talking about not having strength, skill, or size because Beasley has all those components."
nyjets,32ueq8,Dacious96,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:13:27 2015 UTC,I think there's a big difference between play strength and ability to bench press. If u watch tape on beasly almost all of his production comes off of an outside speed rush. He very rarely gets leverage on  Bigger tackles and has no power moves. I don't think hell bust but I think hell have a tougher time in the NFL. Don't down vote me just cuz I'm not in on the beasly circle jerk. Since when does a difference in opinion merit negative attention  I think based on game tape and potential fowler and Gregory are far and above the best edge prospects in this draft
nyjets,32ueq8,-bangarang,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"I didnt downvote you bud. I said he did need to gain weight and I agree he still has a lot to learn how to use his physical tools, but so does almost every prospect coming out of college. But when it comes to rushing the passer, Beasley is one of the top in this class and we don't have any speed rushers on our team and would complement the line. He also has experience rushing the passer standing up with is a pretty big reason why he would be a better pick for us."
nyjets,32ueq8,Dacious96,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:59:30 2015 UTC,He's def a good prospect. I only put fowler and Gregory Definitively above him I just think at 6 the best value is for white/cooper. But I mean we also def need help off the edge I just think beas is overhyped. I hope u don't think I was targeting u. Just trying to generally respond. I get frustrated w NFL and nyjets. Cuz ppl down vote and shit on opinions that differ from the hive mind. Which is limiting

Why would you intentionally put your own job in jeopardy in order to get a coach fired? By not spending money in free-agency, Idzik lost his job AND Ryan's as well.

nyjets,32qfez,MalConstant,18,Wed Apr 15 22:36:07 2015 UTC,"If Idzik was trying to do it I think he was aiming for a 6-10 or 7-9 season. Then going to Woody and being like, look I cleaned up the cap, let me bring in my own guy and rebuild. Either that or he severely overestimated the talent on the team (Harvin was a pure desperation move) which shows he is not qualified to begin with.  Either way I am glad he is gone."
nyjets,32qfez,games456,5,Wed Apr 15 23:16:44 2015 UTC,I agree. Getting Harvin that late in the season seemed like a panic move in response to all the heat he was getting for not spending money. Idzik is like that cheap friend we all have who won't buy any drinks unless its happy hour

Trust me I know, I have been a JETS and Knicks fan for last 15 years and it is very easy to do something and over splurge, even when you know that won't buy you much wins, than take a discipline approach towards rebuilding.   My criticism on Idzik is that he could've done better with the limited resources he had. There's a better way to throw towl, he just created a dump - but at least he didn't sacrifice our future and I am glad he didn't."
nyjets,32qfez,YetiGuy,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:58:22 2015 UTC,"Dude the Jets are constantly rebuilding and making big splashes. Do you remember Favre? Idzik tanked a team. Not fucking hard. I would have had even more cash if I was GM. No Patterson or Vick money wasted. No Percy Harvin rental. Would've resigned cro so ya know, we had a secondary capable of playing pass defense against a college team. Probably skip on DRC, but im really not sure because he might have signed if I raised the offer to a stapler AND a paperclip. We would also have a bitching WR from that cant miss WR draft that we missed on, even though we had 12 picks."
nyjets,32qfez,shoelaces232,-3,Thu Apr 16 15:55:16 2015 UTC,"And any idiot can simply overpay for players.  Speaking of which, I'm not thrilled about our offseason signings so far.  Cromartie goes from a 1 yr $3.5 million deal with AZ to 4 years $32 million with us.  And he's old with an injury history.  No one has anything to say about that?  Buster Skrine is an eh CB at best (consistently ranked at the bottom of the league by PFF) who gets a $25 million contract.  Definitely looks like we are overpaying for players."
nyjets,32qfez,mrmaster2,8,Thu Apr 16 05:37:56 2015 UTC,"And any idiot can simply overpay for players.   You are right Idzik did not overpay for players, he just let them sign everywhere else. Also answer my question. What amazing restructures did he do.    Cromartie goes from a 1 yr $3.5 million deal with AZ to 4 years $32 million with us.   First off this shows how incompetent Idzik was. He let Cromartie walk when he would have taken even less than what Arizona paid him to stay with the Jets. We could have had Cromartie last year where he was ranked a top 10 CB for cheap and the idiot let him go to Arizona, who by the way signed him on the spot when he worked out for them, because they know how to evaluate talent.  I normally do not hold it against people who do not know something but if you are going to talk about contracts you should at least know what you are talking about. The Cromartie contract is fantastic. We can cut him after one year with zero dead money.  It is effectively a 1 year contract for 7 million dollars for someone who was one of the best CB's in the league last year. It is a fucking great signing.   Buster Skrine is an eh CB at best (consistently ranked at the bottom of the league by PFF) who gets a $25 million contract.   Once again his contract is pretty much a 2 year contract at 5.5 million a year. He can be cut in 2017 with very little dead money and almost 5 million in cap savings.   No one has anything to say about that?   Not sure what rock you are hiding under but everyone including this sub were talking about these things for weeks. Not trying to be mean but you simply don't know what you are talking about"

nyjets,32qfez,whygohomie,5,Thu Apr 16 00:08:29 2015 UTC,"You're not alone. Idzik cannot be that thick headed to think that he could survive while Ryan's fired. Matter of fact, he would've known, like anybody else, that the team had too many holes for just a coach to be blamed. In fact, many fans would've supported Rex's another year had it not been the new GM and the owner's insistence to start a new."
nyjets,32qfez,YetiGuy,4,Wed Apr 15 22:55:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I think this is just Rex lashing out at the former management. In fact, I don't blame him for thinking they undermined his season last year. He got screwed, yes, but the coaching and managing was a shitshow and I'm glad things turned out the way they did."

It's almost unheard of for a GM to be fired after only his second season, ESPECIALLY if they never got a chance to hire their own head coach.  I wouldn't be surprised if Idzik hated Ryan, Woody loved him, and Idzik figured he'd take a bit of heat but it would all work out in the end."

I know i'll never win this argument with practically everyone here. I liked what Idzik was trying to do, theoretically, but he was really not that great at evaluating talent to be able to execute what he had in mind. He put all of his eggs into one basket: the draft. That works if you can nail 4-5 players each go around, but when he was only hitting 1, maybe 2, then that doesn't work out. I'll give it to him though, he had some fucking balls of steel by sinking or swimming by his drafts."

nyjets,32qfez,Forty-Three,7,Wed Apr 15 21:54:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this really ""confirms"" anything.  Rex just got fired from the Jets and coming off a 4-12 season, I think he's just pointing his anger and frustrations back at the Jets, so I can't completely believe anything he says for now. I don't think Idzik was a good GM, but I don't know if he's really dumb enough to completely tank a season in the NFL, on the Jets of all teams. Maybe I'm just overestimating Idzik's competence.   Still, Rex was completely shat on the past 2 seasons by both fans and management, I think he's just blowing off steam at them. Rex can have his little temper tantrum, I'm going to listen to it"

I'd be extremely concerned and shocked if front office personnel were actually going around saying that. I think that was the plan from the start of the season but it would be straight dumb if they were openly telling other teams. Something tells me it was just some rumor he heard from a guy and that's what he got out of it.   No one is disputing that the plan seemed to be firing him at the end of the season so it now becomes a great way to take a jab at the Jets organization. He's rightfully pissed as all hell at the Jets so after awhile he'll simmer down and be back to his old self. I worry that now he looks at the Jets like he does the Pats and coaches just as well against us."
nyjets,32qfez,jcinema48,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:52:24 2015 UTC,"Well, then he'd be 3-8 with the Bills against the Jets over the next 6 seasons...  But yeah, Ryan will coach up that Bills team to try and fuck us"
nyjets,32qfez,NannigarCire,7,Thu Apr 16 03:09:11 2015 UTC,"Sounds more like salt to me than confirmation. Idzik's not the reason incompetent coaches remained in positions of power throughout Rex's tenure, nor is he the reason why our offense remained stagnant throughout his career. Rex is acting like he's a victim."
nyjets,32qfez,domsanti,4,Wed Apr 15 22:56:20 2015 UTC,"I really wish Rex got let go on better terms. I think Idzik did fuck him over with the budget, but to do it intentionally is a bit much. Why would he put himself in that position? Rex Ryan wasn't a bad coach, if he had the defense that the Jets have now with the offense the Jets have now, I think he would be on the road to having a winning season and a chance at the playoffs.  So all in all, Idzik is a dick and Rex Ryan needs to learn to keep his mouth closed and let the score do the talking."

Unless Ryan is completely lying, if this phone call really happened it shows that Idzik fucked him over intentionally, since the phone call was only a couple weeks into the season.  Also, Idzik couldn't find another real job in the NFL, settling as a ""consultant"" for the Jaguars.  Maybe the other teams caught wind of this and don't want him on their team."
nyjets,32qfez,domsanti,2,Thu Apr 16 00:10:25 2015 UTC,The pieces of this puzzle seem to fall into place perfectly for Rex's point of view. If there was legit evidence of this I wouldn't be totally surprised.
nyjets,32qfez,td2910,5,Thu Apr 16 03:10:14 2015 UTC,"im gonna preface my thoughts by saying that i refuse to get ex-girlfriend syndrome with rex and start playing the revisionist history game. think back to when mangini got hired - the whole league was on this belichick fever. josh mcdaniels, romeo crennel, charlie weis, and mangini had all leveraged being on belichick's staff into head coaching jobs (none of them turned into much of anything). there was this widespread belichick circlejerk. woody then chooses to go in the complete opposite direction - a brash, bold, outspoken newcomer. rex was a breath of fresh air for this franchise, and those 2 conference title runs were nothing short of magical. all things considered, it was a good hire and he was good for the team.   that being said, we now know who he is as a coach. he is a brilliant defensive mind who neglects the offense entirely. he gets maximum effort from his players but there are lapses in concentration and discipline on the field. his loyalty is admirable, but it is also a fault (he just brought the entire staff of a 4-12 team to buffalo). details like clock management and challenges were a struggle. you are what your record says you are. he's about a .500 coach.   this SI interview is a bunch of horseshit. so this fix was in after tannenbaum was fired? conspiracy from the team president, woody, and idzik? this isn't international espionage, rex. it's also pretty godamn convenient that his version of the story absolves him from any responsibility whatsoever of the team's bad performance. and then he goes after amaro for bringing up accountability. wilkerson, mangold, and davis all questioned the team's focus and discipline at different times last year, but he goes after the rookie to make it seem like amaro is acting out of line. that's fucking pathetic. i thank rex for what he did, but im very happy we moved on."
nyjets,32qfez,NannigarCire,11,Thu Apr 16 07:37:24 2015 UTC,"Ryan's recent interview with Sports Illustrated is getting a lot of press because of his response to Amaro's comments.  However, there is a critical quote that no headlines have focused on so far:   A few weeks into the 2014 season, he became more than just concerned—he felt there was a master plan in place. He got a call from a friend who told him a high-ranking member of the Jets’ scouting department was on the road telling reps from other teams that they weren’t spending money because they were getting a new head coach in 2015.   This quote is pretty damning of Idzik. The call Ryan received from his friend basically confirms that Idzik's plan all along was to get Ryan fired, that's why he didn't spend any money."
nyjets,32qfez,games456,12,Wed Apr 15 21:57:03 2015 UTC,"A quote from Ryan doesn't confirm anything, another source from the Jets facility would have to say this in order to confirm it. The victim saying something happened to them is an accusation. He's accusing Idzik of not spending money to get him fired, when Idzik had publicly come into the locker room at the end of the previous season and yelled out ""THIS GUY IS OUR COACH"" at 8-8. Need more to confirm, and it sounds a lot more like Rex saying ""Nothing I did as a coach was wrong, they had to create a conspiracy to take me out."""
nyjets,32qfez,NannigarCire,5,Wed Apr 15 22:58:00 2015 UTC,"Is this undisputed evidence, of course not. But there is a reason why this has been going around since last year. Everyone knows that Woody made keeping Rex a condition of being hired as GM. It is completely possible that Woody told him he could not fire Rex after the 8-8 season.  The thing that makes it possible for me to believe it is all the stopgaps Idzik went for last year. Like he was trying to get the team to go 6-8 or 7-9 and then have all the money to spend when he brings in a new guy.  Either that or he was simply incompetent."
nyjets,32qfez,games456,-2,Wed Apr 15 23:12:21 2015 UTC,"He didn't have to keep Rex following the 8-8 year and he did. Tanking for the sake of losing Rex doesn't make sense since it puts his own job in jeopardy. It's not like grabbing stopgaps isn't a big part of bad teams efforts to fix the team, that's a very normal thing for teams that were talent strapped like the Jets to do. It's a lot rarer to see teams do what we did this offseason."
nyjets,32qfez,NannigarCire,2,Wed Apr 15 23:16:58 2015 UTC,"He didn't have to keep Rex following the 8-8 year and he did   Who knows, Woody really liked Rex. Maybe Woody said that he can't let him go since they went 8-8. What our team did this year is abnormal because teams in our position normally do not have the amount of money we have. To me Idzik did not look like he was building towards anything. If he wanted to stay with Rex as you are alluding to how can he leave him so bare at his most valued positions. Mac has done the complete opposite for Bowles.  People think it it does not make sense that someone would put there job in jeopardy but If I thought I was a good talent evaluator, and I could bring in my own guys by putting a 6-8 win team on the field, I probably do it.  Maybe he thought it was his only shot to be a successful GM. If you think of it that way it is really not that crazy."
nyjets,32qfez,games456,-1,Wed Apr 15 23:29:23 2015 UTC,"Well, in whatever case- Rex is still placing his own failures on the GM and accusing Idzik of a conspiracy to remove him. There's no solid piece of evidence of this yet, no one's confirmed any of Rex's accusations."
nyjets,32qfez,ZeboTheClown,2,Wed Apr 15 23:33:28 2015 UTC,There is never any evidence in the kind of stuff. I highly doubt Idzik left a journal in FP titled the way I am going to get Rex fired. Sure Rex had issues but to act like we have not been bitching and talking about all the problems with Idzik would be untruthful. I have no idea if this is true but Idzik did odd things so I would not put this past him.
nyjets,32qfez,mrmaster2,5,Wed Apr 15 23:40:51 2015 UTC,"What the fuck kind of owner would tank a team rather than just firing the coach  Also, what kind of GM would tank a team if it meant he would get fired as well  Idzik was dumb, but not that dumb"
nyjets,32qfez,shoelaces232,4,Wed Apr 15 23:12:08 2015 UTC,"If you read the OP, Woody had nothing to do with it.  In fact, Ryan says he felt like Woody wanted him to be the coach for the next 1,000 years.  Ryan said a friend called him at the beginning of last season and told him high ranking Jets execs were telling other teams that they weren't spending any money because they were getting a new head coach in 2015.  Considering no GM gets fired after only 2 years, it's pretty reasonable for Idzik to think he'd take heat for one bad year, but this way he gets Woody to fire Ryan and he can start all over.    If the team goes 6-10 or 7-9 I think Idzik's plan works."

nyjets,32qfez,editnonameedit,-1,Wed Apr 15 22:58:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, Idzik sabotaged his own career to get idiot Rex Ryan fired, and a quote from Rex confirms this.  How dumb can you be dude."
nyjets,32qfez,akaneel,5,Wed Apr 15 23:19:12 2015 UTC,Why would you think that one bad year would lead to a second year GM automatically being fired?  It wouldn't.  He probably thought he'd take some heat but he'd be given the chance to start over with his own people.  And it's not like Ryan is saying he thinks Idzik tried to get him fired.  He's saying high up Jets executives were telling people at the beginning of last season they weren't spending any money because they were getting a new head coach.  If the Jets went 6-10 Idzik's plan would have worked.
nyjets,32qfez,Mixairian,0,Thu Apr 16 00:42:04 2015 UTC,"Rex got fired because he is toxic, and the fact he sucks as a head coach as evidenced by him losing almost 40 games in 4 years.  As you can see with all the shit he talks he attracts nothing but negative attention.  All the Jets loyalty he preached when was here went out the window pretty quick as he is now blaming the Jets for his shortcomings, but some of you can't see past his fraudulent persona.   So it was a larger team wide conspiracy, and that everyone in the organization was involved and openly telling other NFL peeps that they were going to undermine Rex by not drafting a middle round WR and not signing DRC, who signed with the Giants.  BTW the Giants draft 9'th this year (12'th last year), so DRC had a huge impact with them.  I wonder if you're familiar with the roster from the year before, names like.......  Konrad Reuland, Clyde Gates, Ben Ijalana, Saalim Hakim, Josh Cribbs, Ben Obomanu, David Nelson, etc etc etc   Do you remember any of these guys the year before last?   Idzik upgraded that with Decker,  traded for Percy, CJ2K, brought in Vick because he thought he could help,  Also signed Giacomini for a fraction or Howard, traded a 4'th for our lead back Ivory. And he was trying to undermine Rex?  And people shit on the guys drafts but he drafted the best player in the draft in Sheldon Richardson, who with Oday Aboushi made PFF's all Sophomore team.  Amaro made their all rookie team and Pryor was the 27'th rated safety in the NFL despite playing out of position.  So you're telling me Idzik didn't upgrade this roster?  If Rex was the boss like he said he was I suppose he would like to answer for the contracts to Tone and Sanchez which were an unmitigated disaster, or the shitty drafts, but you know Rex, he wants nothing to do with accountability."

Squeaking under the radar despite being projected under 50 overall on all draft boards I've seen. I'd like the pick, honestly (him or a QB like Petty). Having McKinney  learn from Harris and rotate in when Harris needs a break could pan out very well."
nyjets,32tgdn,otomotopia,2,Thu Apr 16 17:26:02 2015 UTC,I take it he's an ILB then?
nyjets,32tgdn,matap821,3,Thu Apr 16 17:31:10 2015 UTC,"Ayup. Super good against the run too, at least against SEC linemen and RBs."
nyjets,32tgdn,otomotopia,3,Thu Apr 16 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a solid second rounder, but I'd also keep my eye open for first round talent that slips down. For example, if Sherff magically falls to us there, we can't pass on it."
nyjets,32tgdn,matap821,3,Thu Apr 16 17:56:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, without a doubt. I'm a pretty big proponent of taking Scherff in the 1st, even. He'd be a great addition to our offensive line, especially with his run blocking skills. He's one of the few clearly NFL ready prospects if he shifts to guard."
nyjets,32tgdn,otomotopia,2,Thu Apr 16 18:31:57 2015 UTC,"He might be my favorite player this draft, but I feel like 6 is way too much of a reach for a non skill-position player. I'd like to trade back for value."
nyjets,32tgdn,matap821,3,Thu Apr 16 19:26:57 2015 UTC,He'd be a great pick in the early 2nd.

But it's very easy to look like a good GM when you have a ridiculous amount of cap. He hasn't even drafted a class yet. Everyone needs to relax with the praise. Same for bowles. Great. He handles media well and he is a no nonsense coach. But he hasn't coached a game yet. That's 90% of what we should care about with the coach.

nyjets,32p5li,seannymo,3,Wed Apr 15 20:57:44 2015 UTC,yeah but in the complete opposite way. Bowles seems to be a no-nonsense type guy. Short and to the point. VERY refreshing.

I can certainly see him being a Ryan Tannehill type player.  Fans always say, oh we should fill up the rest of our roster first, and THEN we'll get a quarterback. Or that next years class will be better.   But if we get too good, we won't be able to draft high enough for a QB. Considering what we added to this team, it's more than likely. And the secret is that next years QB isn't that good. Cook was average this season, Cardale Jones is a backup in college, and Hackenburg has the accuracy of Hawkeye, if Hawkeye was blind, and a quadriplegic.   We won't go anywhere without a quarterback, and Mariota might fall in our lap. He's not perfect, and he might bust, but he might also be great, and most likely, he'll be just good enough for us to compete. And that's worth a 6th overall pick."

So whenever I see a post like this I think to myself which one of these I could better live with. Passing on the franchise, or trying and failing horribly.

Eli Manning was worse than Geno his first THREE years then won a Super Bowl in his fourth. Quarterbacks never used to be expected to become studs when starting right away. Not everyone can do what Andrew Luck did, so closing the door on him after 2 seems dumb to me."
nyjets,32o93s,hottsh0t11,9,Wed Apr 15 15:03:53 2015 UTC,"Eli Manning was not worse than Geno his first 3 years. That is ridiculous. The NFL has become way more of a passing league in the past 10 years than when Eli was just starting out. In Eli's 2nd season, he threw for 3,762 yards, good for 5th in the NFL, with 24 TD's tied for 4th in the NFL. Those numbers would've both ranked 14th in the NFL this past season. Prorating Geno's stats out to 16 games would give him 2,885 yards and 15 TD's. Good for 25th and 23rd in the league respectively.  In 2005, the median passer rating for starters was 85.0. Eli exceeded that number in 6 games. In 2014, the median passer rating for starters was 91.0. Geno exceeded that number in 3 games, one of which was his ridiculously flukey perfect passer rating game.  Literally the only thing Geno has on Eli from his first few seasons is that Geno has a better completion percentage."

nyjets,32o93s,hottsh0t11,2,Wed Apr 15 17:30:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, not everyone can pull an Andrew Luck.  However, it seems like you either can or you can't and how you are handled by the team that drafts you is imperative to your success.  Name me one QB who a team put in immediately that was terrible for 2 years and then became great.  Eli Manning doesn't count, he sat on the bench for half of a season.   It seems like most QB's that are successful have some time on the bench to get up to speed with the game.  You wonder if a guy like Mark Sanchez or Geno Smith would have been great given some time to properly acclimate to the league.    Its the main reason I think the Jets need to take a QB this year, hopefully Mariota.  Because they can actually afford to sit him on the bench for a year.  Maybe two, depending on how well Fitzpatrick and/or Smith play.  I think Mariota has the best intangibles coupled with physical tools.  Yeah he's a system QB but so what.  So was Aaron Rodgers, so was Tom Brady.  They had all of the tools, they just needed the proper coaching to get them to the pinnacle."
nyjets,32o93s,subrhyme,3,Wed Apr 15 16:00:56 2015 UTC,"Not that I dont agree with the majority of your sentiment, but Drew Brees played very poorly his first two year starting even after sitting for a year. His stats are eerily similar too, even taking his team from 8-8 his first year starting to 2-9 his second year starting.

Geno has had jack shit to even throw to and an offense run by a coach that didn't give a shit about it. When Decker was fully healthy, Geno had his better games. I can't chalk that up to coincidence.  Should Geno get more than this season to prove it? No, but it would be retarded to not at least see what he can do with the weapons and a Chan Gailey offense."

I mean he's had a rotating WR core, a rotating system and offensive cord.  I'm not trying to make excuses, i think fans are too quick to turn away.  I dont want to continue to lose, but I think players need to be given time and throwing 1st and 2nd round picks into the fire isn't the way to do it.  They need time under vet QB's and they need time to develop."
nyjets,32o93s,pronstar,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:02:46 2015 UTC,"True, but it seems like a lot of his problems were because of lack of trust from the coaches. Scripted play calls, no audibles, no second looks. If Marty called for a pass to Harvin, Geno had to throw it even if Percy was in double coverage. This is a guy who ran a no huddle at West Virginia. I wanna see a few more games like @Miami where Geno got a lot more control over the offense and played lights out."
nyjets,32o93s,matap821,3,Wed Apr 15 16:31:59 2015 UTC,"So one of two things are happening here, either   A) the Jets Coaching staff, comprised of Rex Ryan and Marty Mornenhweig(or however the hell you spell that) who have a collective 60 years of coaching experience, all of a sudden had a mental lapse and decided to not give this budding star the reigns and ability to make calls on his own, and basically every NFL analyst didn't do their homework properly and have assessed Geno Smith inproperly.   or  B) Geno Smith isn't good enough to take the reigns and make calls on his own, and damn near every NFL analyst can see that and are making that assessment along with Rex Ryan and Marty Morningwood.    I'm more inclined to think that the Miami game and ones like it are the exception and not the rule.  I think he can be a decent game manager, but is that what we are looking for?  I sure as hell am not."

Yup, Geno as is, I wouldn't even want for a backup QB.  That really should indicate Geno's low ceiling."

nyjets,32o93s,BrutalJones,-2,Wed Apr 15 12:32:54 2015 UTC,Fitz. Fitz wins the qb competition hands down. It won't even be close. You are in complete denial about geno.
nyjets,32o93s,John_YJKR,3,Wed Apr 15 16:11:31 2015 UTC,"I said I think Geno starts game one and you claim I'm in complete denial?  Alright.  I barely made any of my feelings on the guy known.  So I guess I will now.  Geno is probably not the answer.  But from the moment we drafted him we were told repeatedly by every scout and people within the organization that he wasn't NFL ready right away.  That if he had to start right away it would be bad for him.  And that maybe a few years down the line he could be successful.  Of course we know what happened.  He was forced to start right away and on top of that was given terrible offensive weapons.  He made minor strides in year two, and actually put together some pretty nice games once he had all his weapons.  I would have liked to see him make greater strides.  This will be Fitzpatrick's 11th year in the league.  He is coming off of his best season.  I don't think his injury will matter at all.  He'll be fine.  He's in the bottom third of QBs in the league as is Geno.  But this IS who Fitzpatrick is and I'm not certain there isn't still room left for Geno to grow.  Ultimately I don't have a lot of faith in either of them.  But I do think there is a CHANCE Geno becomes a league average QB though he could also be terrible again, whereas Fitzpatrick is pretty much locked in to be a below average (albeit startable) QB.  Geno is just a guy everyone said needed several years to really blossom.  Well, he's had that time and now is his chance.  I'd rather role the dice.  See if he has taken any strides in the first few games with a new OC and new weapons.  If we're 4 games in and it's clear he is never going to take the next step we can lock in Fitzpatrick and his average-if-we're-lucky QB play."
nyjets,32o93s,BusinessSavvyPunter,-1,Wed Apr 15 17:51:43 2015 UTC,Fitz never had much offense to work with either. He's generally always taken care of the football though. He finished 9th in qb rating last year with a team that actually had a decent offense to work with. I wish geno were better and I agree neither are the answer. But fitz is better qb right now and the team will start the qb that gives them the best chance at winning. The new regime had nothing to do with geno being a jet so they have no interest in developing him and hoping he turns into a legit starter. They aren't going to waste starts on him. They brought in fitz to start. Not to mentor geno. I think they plan on drafting their qb and having fitz as a stop gap. I think it's clear they have little faith in geno. If he somehow wins in camp then great. But I truly doubt he can do it.
nyjets,32o93s,John_YJKR,2,Wed Apr 15 20:14:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bit much to say the new regime has NO interest in developing a young quarterback with two years left on a rookie contract.. And if it is, I'm not looking forward to that type of regime, ignoring the development of young talent is how we got to the #6 pick."
nyjets,32o93s,mosherd14,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:33:31 2015 UTC,Pretty much the attitude is if geno can show something by beating fitz in camp then good. But when he very likely does not they are going to use fitz as a stop gap and draft a qb of their choice. The writing is on the wall. They want to move on from geno. It happens all the time when a new GM and coach take over and there's no legit starter. They move on from the pieces if the player doesn't show they can use him.
nyjets,32o93s,John_YJKR,2,Wed Apr 15 21:07:06 2015 UTC,"this is now your 5th or 6th time that i've casually seen you tell someone about how ""in denial"" someone is about geno.  you're as much a fitz promoter as anyone else is a geno apologist.    you cannot know enough to jump down people's throat about ""being in denial about fitz.""  you need to take it easy and stop trying to be the conductor on the fitzpatrick train."

If there is any chance that he can get Jameis Winston for a sensible price on draft night, he has to consider it.

In his QB camp, which is just him and Gruden, he seemed a lot more relaxed, and seems like a really smart dude  The off the field debauchery is obviously bad, but still he's just a college kid. Plus a lot of the backlash in the media is 100% fueled by racism. There wasn't a peep when Peyton shoved his ass into a female trainer's face.

We were coming off of a circus with Tebow, Tanny needed to be the scapegoat, and we needed change.  I was an avid support of Idzik - I liked his approach in theory, but the reality is it was an awkward situation.  It doesnt help that Idzik kept the old scouting crew too...they are likely the ones who leaked stupid shit like noted in the article.  bottom line?  It was time to rebuild from the ground up in the front office.  Will miss what we had Rex, at the same time none of those reasons excuse the lackluster job in 2011, 2012, 2013.    This paragraph sums it up perfectly! ""This also shows how good Rex is at playing the media game. He's getting his side of things out there. The front office made error after error in its approach, and this article makes mention of many of them. There were plenty of coaching problems also, but Rex and his staff were able to control the narrative surrounding the team. I think it would be fair to say the 2014 season was more on Idzik than Ryan, but it was kind of striking how much blame a coaching staff that missed the Playoffs four straight years escaped"""

nyjets,32muma,Tig_ol_Bitties91,6,Wed Apr 15 02:02:38 2015 UTC,"I think he would be a great fit at 6 because:   A dominant pass rusher is our best bet, our other need is o-line but there's no one in this draft worth the 6. There are a plethora of pass rushers that could feasibly go at the 6.   I believe Gregory and Fowler are the best pass rushers in this draft. They both have the ideal size (Gregory's a bit light but that is easily fixed) they are both true hybrid rushers, they can play standing up or in the dirt. Bowles will eat that shit up.   I would prefer Fowler but you have to think that he'll be off the board in the top five (2 QBs, Williams, a WR to Oakland and probably Fowler)   If we trade down to Cleveland's 12 or even St. Louis' 10, we run the risk of missing out on one of those true pass rushers with that ideal size."

nyjets,32muma,JASPriest,-3,Wed Apr 15 15:44:32 2015 UTC,"He smoked weed. I repeat, he smoked weed. Other people rape people, steal and get in dui's that hurt people and stay in their draft spots... But he smoked weed. If both Winston and Marriota are gone and we DON'T get him, I'll be extremely upset. Passing up on talent for a drug that's as addicting as coffee and doesn't even enhance his performance is insane to me."
nyjets,32muma,boredymcbored,9,Wed Apr 15 02:44:52 2015 UTC,"It's not the act of him smoking weed, it's the fact that he couldn't stop when he knew he was getting tested.  Weed is still illegal and against NFL rules, and it's a question about his discipline that most people are concerned."
nyjets,32muma,troddle,0,Wed Apr 15 03:18:05 2015 UTC,"I understand that. A lot of times, young people think they can buck the system or don't follow rules if they don't see the purpose in it. Not to mention, the amount of nanograms require is low. Sitting in a hot box or going to parties can sustain weed levels in the body.   If the only ""problem"" he has is smoking, I hardly see that as a problem with discipline. He was able to become an elite athlete and was once at the top of his draft class. He can clearly work hard and commit himself to things, he just likes to relax with some weed. I don't see how him smoking somehow trumps all those accolades he acquired, especially since chance of weed addiction is super low. It wasn't smart but it's definitely not a huge character flaw or the end  of the world like many NFL GMs see it as IMO. I'd still draft him high for his talent, just coach him better on when and when not to use it. I see it as a wake up call more than anything."
nyjets,32muma,boredymcbored,2,Wed Apr 15 04:39:07 2015 UTC,"If the only ""problem"" he has is smoking, I hardly see that as a problem with discipline.    well you are wrong about that.  as troddle said, not only is it an issue of lack of discipline (knowing you are going to get tested and still doing it) but he is already entering the league with at least one strike against the drug policy.  That means he gets tested more and has harsher penalties.  And he already admitted that he can't stop, even when he knows he will get tested...  How do you think he will act if you toss in the guaranteed money from the lottery pick?  Maybe he will turn his shit around, maybe not, but that's a pretty high risk for a 6th pick."
nyjets,32muma,donat28,1 point,Wed Apr 15 07:32:42 2015 UTC,"When you take draft position into account, I guess I understand, but, I really don't see this incident as a character flaw like everyone else. He (to my knowledge) never admitted he couldn't stop, but said he did so much, it was still in his system. I doubt that he stopped as early as he said did, but I do believe he stopped at a time he thought it could clear through his system. 5 nanograms is a low amount and there are so many factors that can keep weed in your system since it doesn't just flush out like alcohol. Real character flaws are work ethic, IMO, I think his hate has been petty. But ifno one agrees, that's fair. I just hope we don't miss out on a stud because of it."

I'm not debating whether addiction is real or not because it is, however, the chances of you becoming dependant are very low and once you get to that level, it is one of the easier drugs to recover from.  But I don't think it's fair to label him an addict for this. He fucked up, and probably smoked closer to the combine than he should've, but that doesn't automatically make you addicted. He probably thought he could clear out from his system before the combine and it just didn't happen."

It's stupid, it's Geno's third year and he's down improvement with a bad oc and a coach who didn't care about offense. Not every qb is luck, Wilson or rg3( he killed it his first year) and can come in and be awesome. It's ridiculous. Let him develop, this is the year he has to show serious promise. If he doesn't then let's move on. Also I think Gaileys offense will be tremendous for Geno."
nyjets,32ltmw,arv98s,3,Wed Apr 15 12:59:12 2015 UTC,Then: what a fucking steal.  Top qb in the draft obtained in the second? Holy shit!  Now: he's shown he can fucking ball so we know he's capable of being beyond solid.  That's a lot if it can be consistent.

Then as picks kept coming off the board, and Geno was still there, I started getting worried again. Then we took him in the 2nd, which I think was still a reach, and it sucked.  Now: Weirdly, hopefully optimistic. Rex was a QB killer, and a train wreck with the offense, and I'd like to see what Geno can do under a new regime."

In some ways sanchez with how he would screw was more frustrating then geno still do.

We might get the Pats opening night, that's really the only chance for the Sunday crew, but I bet it's against Bills.  One Monday night game will be the Colts for their Superbowl match up theme this year. The other Monday night will be Pats or Bills, depending on if we get the Pats on the season opener.   If our team really looks good we might flex into a Sunday night game for the 2nd half of the season against one of the teams in our division, this is of course IF we are doing really well and other teams in our division are doing well."
nyjets,32hi2l,Dacious96,2,Mon Apr 13 22:09:38 2015 UTC,I would like to see us against the patriots the first game of the season and the Giants on Thanksgiving. Maybe the Eagles on a Monday night?
nyjets,32hi2l,rbart65,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:38:56 2015 UTC,Eagles on Thanksgiving. Let's roast a bird.
nyjets,32hi2l,Killsitty,2,Tue Apr 14 17:21:31 2015 UTC,I think the Bills at home is a guarenteed primetime game. Ryan return to Metlife is going to create so many headlines.  They always like to give a Pats game a primetime slot. I think we atleast get one Thursday night and one Monday night game. I could also see the Giants game being primetime.
nyjets,32hi2l,ThreeCranes,2,Mon Apr 13 23:48:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely Pats to open the season.  It just reeks of the NFL's style.   We'll have a Monday Nighter against Rex and the Bills.  And I like the idea of Thanksgiving night against the G-Men.    All three of those sound totally like NFL moves.  I don't see us getting any sunday night action though.  They reserve that for the Cowboys, Broncos and Saints for the most part."

I'm pumped, but there's a reason that the Yankees Mets World Series in 2000 had comparably the lowest ratings for a World Series ever. It's a big market, but it's still only one market compared to the usual two.   Edit: We'll definitely have a prime time game against the Colts, not sure it'll be a Thursday Night, though."

Neither QBs from the grey bowl highlights look like NFL QB's based off those highlights alone. The QB from Hamilton looked a little more like an NFL QB than the guy you're trying to hype, but in those highlights neither of them showed any pocket presence and that's a big flag. The one throw escaping to the right was nice, and Geno actually did the same exact play against the Dolphins- but it's not a hugely important part of NFL success."

Blind faith in rookie QB's being the answer is a trend that needs to die.   We have other WAY more important needs. We've had a great offseason thus far, and hopefully management will continue to make the right choices in the draft. If their right choice happens to be MAriota/Winston then so be it. I root for all who put on Green and White. Them two aint exactly anything worth salivating over is all im saying."

nyjets,32gny4,subrhyme,3,Mon Apr 13 19:23:10 2015 UTC,A) comparing Mariota to Manziel is ridiculous.  B) The beautiful thing about taking a QB this year is you don't have to start him right away.  We can start Fitz or Geno and teach Mariota the game.  Let him learn and grow and then hopefully start him in his 2nd or 3rd year.  It makes too much sense.
nyjets,32gny4,chrisalberico,0,Mon Apr 13 19:55:10 2015 UTC,Plus our most important need is QB
nyjets,32gny4,boredymcbored,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:31:27 2015 UTC,"We really don't have as glaring as a problem anywhere else than at QB. You could argue OLB, but with our secondary and considering we still have Coples, Harris, and a couple other depth players, we could use a lot of improvement, but will be able to manage otherwise. Our Wr core is great now, we could use some young legs but don't NEED it. Lineman wise, we DO need some good guys, but our front now is good should everyone stay health. We have depth at RB with Ridley so that's not as much as an issue.   Frankly speaking, it's super hard for NFL teams to be successful without a good to great QB at the helm. Of the past couple SB champs, 8 of the past 10 had qbs that are on the ""elite"" level. All 10 were at least good. Geno's not even that. One could argue his coaching staff was not the best and he was raised during a huge management issue, but regardless, he's not going to be anything close to elite.  We need to pick a QB this draft because we're not going to be this high on the boards anytime soon. Teams will ALWAYS need a QB, meaning we shouldn't bank on getting a player next year because we don't know where we'll end up. With the improvements we've made on the roster, we're very capable of racking a lot of wins. Say we have 9 wins, we're in the middle of next year's draft. In the middle, the QB hungry teams will get the day 1 talent and we'll still be a question mark at QB. We currently have a high pick, go with the player that'll make the biggest impact on the team instead of banking on later."
nyjets,32gny4,subrhyme,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:44:07 2015 UTC,"GO GET HIM!... We're not going to be this close again for a while.  Next year we're going to have to give up a whole hell of a lot more than this and next years 1st to get a possible franchise QB.  Take the kid, sit him and let him learn.  People around the league think this kid has the right head on his shoulders to learn the game.  TAKE THE CHANCE.  its not going to come along again for a while."
nyjets,32g4fn,TheUnApolegist,29,Mon Apr 13 14:58:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not disputing any of your analysis, but how does QB not make your list?"
nyjets,32g4fn,rarelyserious,3,Mon Apr 13 15:17:03 2015 UTC,"QB is a giant question mark right now. I did want to put it on the list, however, I felt guard was more important after looking at some tape from games 7-17 last season. I also watched tape on Fitz and I think he can be exactly what we needed Mark Sanchez to be in the 2009 and 2010 seasons. Fitz doesn't turn the ball over often and doesn't often throw ill-advised passes. If you're asking whether or not I think Geno is the answer, then my answer is clearly ""no."" But I have more faith in Fitz performing averagely than a plug-and-play QB from this year's draft.  Edit: I haven't watched nearly as much footage as some members of this sub, so if I'm mistaken in any of my analysis, please let me know."
nyjets,32g4fn,viewless25,5,Mon Apr 13 15:21:31 2015 UTC,I think what you're missing is a long term plan. Geno doesn't have enough consistency to be a future QB and Fitz is too old.
nyjets,32g4fn,subrhyme,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:35:52 2015 UTC,"My long term plan would probably include a QB from next year's draft. I don't think the answer is in this draft for us, and I feel that Fitz probably has 3 years left. He's only 32 right now, and there are a few QBs in the league that are 35 and up.  Edit: I was wrong. The top 10 oldest QBs are at least 33, though."
nyjets,32g4fn,subrhyme,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:42:41 2015 UTC,"Who do you presume we take in next years draft for QB?  Lets say we go 9-7, and have the 18th pick... Definitely realistic with the talent upgrade this off season."
nyjets,32g4fn,John_YJKR,3,Mon Apr 13 18:45:18 2015 UTC,"Cook, Jones, Hackenberg, Prescott? There will be plenty of talent in next years draft with a less serious drop in talent after the highest ranked QB."
nyjets,32g4fn,subrhyme,4,Mon Apr 13 19:10:09 2015 UTC,"I would like an explanation of why you think any of the QB's you listed would be any better than Marcus Mariota.  And mind you, I'm not jumping out of my shoes for Mariota, I just think this year is the year for us to take a QB high up in the Draft.  It's not going to cost us much, if anything to get him and he's as good a prospect as any that has come out in a while.  At the beginning of the CFB Season he was thought of as the best QB in college football, I guess his gaudy statistics have really hurt his draft stock?  He's not Andrew Luck, but guess what... not many QB prospects are, and if you wait around for a guy like that you're going to be holding your breath for a very long time.  Trading up from the middle of the draft next year to get a guy who might be a smidge better than Mariota is ridiculous.  We don't need anything that badly this year that spending the #6 pick on a QB that we can sit and teach the game, rather than throwing him to the wolves would be that much of a detriment to us.  This is the year to do it, it wont hurt that badly and we can groom him to be a Jet.  If we take a QB next year its going to be because the two we have on the roster suck again and then we're going to have to insert the new kid again.  It doesn't work, it hasn't worked... we're never going to find a franchise QB that way.  The last guy we almost got it done with was Pennington and he sat for his first year or so... Kids need to learn the game!!...  Sorry for the Rant.  I just don't get why taking Mariota is a bad idea to Jet fans, its our only hope to finding a franchise guy.  We can actually take our time with him.  Is it because he is a system QB, well guess who else was a system QB... Aaron Rodgers... Tom Brady... etc etc etc.."
nyjets,32g4fn,John_YJKR,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:22:27 2015 UTC,Trade up. Next year would be the year to do it. We could even use the 6th this year to secure a 1st next year to give us more to move up with. I doubt the latter though.
nyjets,32g4fn,subrhyme,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:51:30 2015 UTC,"Ok so trade up.  Who is usually at the top of drafts? I'll answer that, QB needy teams.  So lets say the Titans suck again, the Raiders suck again and the Redskins suck again the Bears and the Brown too.  They're all in front of us, they all need a QB or at the very least, could use a QB.  Which one is giving up their place in line to the Jets and what are they asking for coming out of the 18th pick?  Multiple 1st rounders, we'd have to give up 3 first rounders to get to the #2-3 pick and then we're still gambling on a prospect.  Right now you can get a kid for 1, maybe 2 first rounders who has all of the tools.  A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush."
nyjets,32g4fn,BryanClark90,2,Mon Apr 13 18:58:20 2015 UTC,"Titans will either commit to the young qb they already have or get one this season, raiders have Carr who they won't abandon after only 2 seasons, redskins will be looking for a qb, bears have cutler despite what the media would have you think he is their guy, the browns maybe because they could commit to johnny or they could abandon him altogether. So pretty much we'd be competing with 1 or 2 teams. It's nowhere near the scenario you presented. Connor cook is worth 2 first rounders."
nyjets,32g4fn,Rugger11,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:04:15 2015 UTC,"to get to #2 or 3 from 18 its going to take a bit more than 2 first rounders, (cite the Redskins trading up to #2 for RGIII)  That took 3 first round picks and a 2nd round pick.  TO GO 4 SPOTS!.. Also, why on earth do we all feel Connor Cook is so much better than Mariota?  Last year at this time, Mariota was the golden child, now apparently he's chopped liver.  Whats to say Cook doesn't suffer the same fate?  We have the opportunity now, take it."
nyjets,32g4fn,Rugger11,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:10:41 2015 UTC,Difference is Cook runs a prostyle offense.
nyjets,32g4fn,TreSeven,5,Mon Apr 13 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"I find your analysis of our WR corps to be wildly unrealistic. Teams do not have the depth you are talking about at that position. I'm not saying we shouldn't draft one, but it is not our 3rd biggest need by a long shot."
nyjets,32g4fn,TreSeven,-1,Mon Apr 13 15:29:28 2015 UTC,"That's okay. I'm not saying the positional unit needs an overhaul; I'm saying that we need a 4th WR. Teams with great/elite passing games have a 4th WR that can step up and play, we really don't (unless Owusu or Graham can work). The way I see it, in the event of an injury to either Decker or Marshall, our passing game will stagnate like last year. Teams that don't have depth get exposed late in the season."
nyjets,32g4fn,TreSeven,3,Mon Apr 13 15:48:20 2015 UTC,"Teams with great passing games don't have 4th sringers that are any more talented than the crop of guys we do. Gadget players, sure, but from a pure talent perspective, we're good. Our problem with Decker hurt last year was that made Kerley our #1. This coming season if something should happen to Marshall or Decker, having the other one and Kerley as our top 2 and one of the other guys stepping up shouldn't be that much of an issue. Plus we have Amaro who is another pass-catching option. Depth is fine there. And by that I don't mean the position can't be improved, but there are other spots that need help much before WR."
nyjets,32g4fn,viewless25,5,Mon Apr 13 16:37:08 2015 UTC,"I think guard is our biggest need, but it's not as important a position as LB or QB"
nyjets,32g4fn,viewless25,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"You think we need an upgrade over Oday or Carpenter that badly? I think Carpenter's pass protection will be a huge upgrade over Colon, which is why I'm not as worried about it."
nyjets,32g4fn,Rugger11,2,Mon Apr 13 15:50:50 2015 UTC,"Actually I completely forgot we added Carpenter haha. Still, Oday was alright, but an upgrade at guard I think would go a long way towards improving the offense, since neither of our starters are particularly good. I do think OLB should be addressed first though since it'll probably have a much bigger impact."
nyjets,32g4fn,Rugger11,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:01:20 2015 UTC,"I too would love to 1st rounder on our line, but the only player that seems a sure fit to play as OG right off the bat is Scherff. Maybe we'll trade with the Browns like everybody is currently speculating."
nyjets,32g4fn,Rugger11,2,Mon Apr 13 16:11:25 2015 UTC,"I agree, Scherff would be a good fit, but yeah, only if we trade down. I think adding Cann, Marpet, or Tomlinson in the second after hopefully Beasley in the first would be a better way to go."
nyjets,32g4fn,NannigarCire,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:20:01 2015 UTC,"Here's my take on our needs from a /r/NFL_Draft thread   But yours is solid. I think you underestimate our receiving core while overestimating the rest of the league's, however."
nyjets,32g4fn,mosherd14,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:14:18 2015 UTC,"I like your draft needs, the only thing I don't think we need is RB. I'm perfectly content with Ivory, Powell, and Ridley to hold us down for the season. I know Ivory is injury prone, but Ridley went 3 years I think without missing a game.  I have faith in our WRs this year - don't get me wrong - but I think the better passing teams in the league always have 4 WRs.   http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/passing  All of the top 10 teams and most of the top 15 teams have 4 WRs that all contribute, and some of those teams have absolutely no run game. I feel we would easily jump into the top 15 if we have a speedier #3 and Kerley assumed a Cole Beasley type of role. I could be completely wrong, though."
nyjets,32g4fn,subrhyme,3,Mon Apr 13 16:30:39 2015 UTC,"I put RB at #2 before the Powell re-signing and the Ridley signing. I'd still have it about 3 or 4 because all of our runningbacks are off contract after this season, so I'd like to see a 3rd or 4th dedicated to it.  I don't disagree with having 4 contributing receivers, I just think you underestimate the potential of our depth receivers to step up into the 4th role. I assume you trust Marshall, Decker, and Kerley for the 1-3 roles, but we finally get Shaq Evans from injury, Quincey Enunwa after a year of developing, Owusu and Powell now have a little bit of experience. I'm not saying we're stacked or that we shouldn't bother drafting a WR, I'm just saying we're not as needy as we have been in the past 2 years and that we shouldn't force drafting a receiver in the first two days of the draft."
nyjets,32g4fn,vbar44,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:38:18 2015 UTC,"You're correct, I don't have much faith in our receivers. That's because all of our Practice Squaders and depth guys were taught by Sanjay Lal, haha. I suppose they could make the transition, but I don't have much faith in our team's ability to draft WRs."
nyjets,32g4fn,BryanClark90,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:02:55 2015 UTC,"But 4th string guys are not getting many targets. It is like that on every team. If a 4th string guy is going to be a contributor, it will be on special teams or as a gadget player. Marshall, Decker, and Kerley are a great trio. Plus you have Amaro as another pass-catching option. That is allot of mouths to feed."
nyjets,32g4fn,vbar44,2,Tue Apr 14 03:12:30 2015 UTC,"I'd put RB over WR in a heartbeat. Ivory and Powell are free agents after this year and I don't believe the details of Ridley's contract are out. Ivory and Ridley have injury concerns as well. After this season, that position could be wide open. If we draft someone this year, there will be less pressure on him as he will not be starting. RBs are a dime a dozen so it is a good move to draft one to play for a few years on a cheap rookie deal with Ivory and Powell's contracts being up after the season. I love him to death but there are questions about Ivory and how he fits into Gailey's system. There are talks about possible trading him away as a result."
nyjets,32g4fn,BryanClark90,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:42:09 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with drafting a RB, but I don't see how he's going to make it onto our depth chart. I suppose signing him to the practice squad would work well, but those spaces are limited, too. And this draft appears to be so deep at RB that an UFA wouldn't be out of the question. I've read the things about Ivory, too, but I feel he's one of the few RBs in this league that could be an everydown back, and I don't see us giving that up. I'm not opposed to drafting an RB, but the dime a dozen statement is true, and there will always be more next year. This draft is pretty deep in WR and I like the idea of grabbing Greene."
nyjets,32g4fn,vbar44,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:02:24 2015 UTC,"How can you say that about the depth chart when you are promoting us drafting a WR? After this year, 2/3 of our top backs will not be under contract. At that same time, our top 3 WRs will all be under contract."
nyjets,32g4fn,subrhyme,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:10:05 2015 UTC,"My view:   OLB, for the same reasons as you listed is our main need. While we have good interior pressure with Wilkerson and Richardson, one exterior force turns our defense into a surefire elite run and pass defense for the next two years, and potentially further. With Pace in his twilight and Coples looking like an unlikely re-signing after his 5th year, it's a move for both the future and the immediate.  QB: I'm putting higher value on premier positions and i think QB is our second biggest need after EDGE. Geno might turn himself into a good game manager given some more time, but his lack of anticipation, his dreary pocket presence, and his tendency to throw blind at times makes him more of a liability than I wish he was. He could still become a good stopgap with development, but it feels to me like a certainty that he won't be the teams long-term option. The same goes with FItzpatrick. A second/third/fourth round QB prospect like Hundley, Bonner, Petty, Grayson (personally, Hundley for me) will have time to sit while Geno/Fitz take over this upcoming season and hopefully turn into at least a start-able player.  OT: Same things you said, one of my preferred situations would be to move into the early teens of the 1st round via trading back, pick up a high talent OLB who's going to fall like Gregory or Dupree and use the pick we gain to grab an OT.  OG: Same things you said. If you really want to watch Aboushi get murdered in pass coverage watch him against the Titans. Klug and Casey get Aboushi with the same exact outside-in-swim move every single time. Guards a position we could pass in, but we need someone who can excel at it.  TE: Jace is great, but he's still a work in progress. Everyone talks up competition in regards to QBs, but competition in other positions is good too. TE is a position where our depth is practically special-teams aces who happen to be 6'6. Picking up a high potential TE in the later rounds of the draft like small schooler James O'Shaughnessy (Who's drawn comparisons as a cross between Vernon Davis and Dennis Pitta) will give us a high talent depth with potential starting ability, instead of having to hitch all of our wagons onto Jace.  *DT: This is actually tied with TE for our 5th need. We have no depth after Harrison and there's still a potential that we're going to lose him altogether. If Bowles plans to stick with the 3-4 for the long run, grabbing a NT in this draft (at least as depth) is a necessity."
nyjets,32g4fn,BryanClark90,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:32:59 2015 UTC,"OLB - Simple. In order to be the best defense in the league we need an elite, versatile, well-sized rusher. Dante Fowler or Randy Gregory are my picks simply because their size and versatility are unmatched.   OL - We need immediate interior help as we groom Bricks replacement. I'm not convinced Giaccomini is a bust just yet. Draft a versatile lineman, slide him inside now so he can make a difference Day 1 and kick him out in the next couple years. If DJ Humphries is there in the 2nd I'll be surprised, but I would jump on it.   RB - They'll all be gone in a year, and even if they aren't. We need a home run threat. This is a deep deeeeep class. Duke Johnson.   QB - I've been sold on Garret Grayson for a while, closest NFL style QB other than Winston. Have him come in work the bench and the playbook for a year or two. This year he's a #3, he gets a great mentor in Fitz in year one. Then maybe he's the #2 next year. If he is better than Geno it's a win. If Geno improves (which I believe he will) it's a win and we could potentially land a great backup."
nyjets,32g4fn,subrhyme,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:24:37 2015 UTC,"Good Write up but you immediately lose credibility by not at least listing QB.  It should be first, but you don't even have it on there.  Also never say Oday Obushi is a poor mans Mike Iupati again... he's not, end of story.   The Jets need a QB:  Obvious, biggest need on the team, should be filled in the draft.  If they don't take Winston/Mariota, expect a mid to late round pick as a hail mary. They should use the 6th pick on a QB if they can though, as they probably wont have the luxury of picking that high again for a while.   Then they need an OLB:  Agreed Pace and Babin are getting old, however using the 6th pick this year on an OLB isn't necessary as the teams defense will be leaps and bounds better than it was last year and we ended the season in 6th for total sacks.  Already have plenty of production from the position, just not a guy that we can call our own for the next 5-10 years.  This is a position that could be addressed next year in the first round just as easily as it could be this year.  I would hold off in favor of finding a signal caller.    Then they need a Guard: The addition of Carpenter is a nice one, but they need a young road grating blocker, could definitely wait until next year to be addressed but I wouldn't be surprised to see them grab someone mid round this year, as its fairly deep in the round 2-3 range for OL   Then they need a Tackle: Same story as guard, not a huge need but will definitely need to be addressed in the coming years.  Would like to see some later picks used here on guys who could use some coaching.  Guard is definitely more pressing a need but Tackle isn't too far behind.  Then they need a TE:  Jace Amaro might be good, MIGHT.  We will see how he progresses this year, I like his trajectory but even if he becomes a stud, Jeff Cumberland is our 2nd TE.  Not good.  We need another run blocking pass catching TE.  He doesn't have to be Jimmy Graham or Gronk, he could be if he wants (I wont complain) but regardless we need a guy that can play the H-Back role.    Tied with TE the Jets need a free Safety:  Gilchrist wasn't that good in San Diego, I think he's going to benefit from being in a stacked secondary but the Jets need to find a real ball hawk that can play the back end.  Putting Calvin Pryor in the Strong Safety Role is important because now he can attack and blitz, we need a guy who can play center field."
nyjets,32g4fn,BryanClark90,3,Mon Apr 13 18:34:43 2015 UTC,This subreddit is frequently overlooking how shitty our QB situation is.  We are always so falsely confident with even mediocre QBs.
nyjets,32g4fn,subrhyme,0,Mon Apr 13 18:49:13 2015 UTC,This is not the draft to get a QB in.
nyjets,32g4fn,BryanClark90,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:58:02 2015 UTC,True but that's a different story. All I keep hearing is how desperately we need a pass rusher.  Give me a break. We need a QB
nyjets,32g4fn,subrhyme,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:12:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and we can use this year to evaluate Geno with some actual weapons. Theres a reason he looked a lot better after we got Percy..... Build up the trenches and complete our defense this  year and if  Geno shits the bed grab a guy next year."
nyjets,32g4fn,mosherd14,2,Tue Apr 14 00:19:05 2015 UTC,Okay that's fair. I see what you're saying now. That's if Geno even starts week 1 though.
nyjets,32g4fn,subrhyme,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:30:15 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the Jets always need a QB on years when its not a good Draft to take a QB.  The problem is, you can't predict how the kids still in college are going to look this time next year.  Brett Hundley was thought to be the best QB at points last year, now he looks like a 3rd rounder.  Also, the Jets just romped up their roster.  4-12 shouldn't be a reality next year.  We're going to have a higher draft pick.  Getting into position to take a QB in the first round will be difficult, if not impossible.  If the usual suspects need QB's there will be a line of teams in front of us with the same needs.  Namely the Browns, the Redskins, the Texans, The Bills, The Jags, The Raiders, The Titans.  I love how people just say, we'll take Connor Cook next year.  Apparently the Jets are the only team that knows he exists."
nyjets,32g4fn,subrhyme,2,Tue Apr 14 14:30:20 2015 UTC,"Like most Jets fans, you're impatient, overvaluing the postion, and undervaluing what we can do. Next year i'm expecting us to have a LOWER draft pick because I expect us to do decently well.  Geno has been on par with Sanchez with far less talent. He was markably better once we added Percy. He's only in his third year. Why don't we take a chance to develop a QB for once. Quit being fickle. We can use this year to see how Geno does in Chan's offense(which will be closer to the spread which plays MASSIVELY to Geno's strengths. You want to a qb next if he shits the bed? Good me too. Will we miss on a propsect if we don't take one now? Maybe, but with the talent and depth coming out next year it's less likely than WASTING a pick on Mariota at 6. He's as much a project as Geno was yet you're trying to say you'll work with him and give him time to develop? Bullshit. We'll be sitting here in 3 years having the same argument. Instead, let's trade down our pick at 6, build up the line that is aging, or get that pass rusher and maybe fanagle the trade down this year to get a first rounder next year. Then we will be in a position to package both of our first rounders next year to move up and get the QB we need if Geno doesn't turn around. I'd rather build to be successful than continue the circle jerk of mismanagement our fans call for."
nyjets,32g4fn,mosherd14,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:42:06 2015 UTC,"Geno Smith isn't an NFL Caliber QB as noted in his 3 Interception quarter against the Buffalo Bills this year.  He is Wildly inconsistent and has way more bad games then good. If you had to make a bet, and the stakes were high, would you say he will succeed or fail?   My money is on fail.  What I can't grasp is why everyone all of a sudden thinks Mariota is a shitbox?   If last year at this time I said the Jets would be getting Mariota, fans would have jizzed their pants.  Now, because Todd McShay and Bucky Brooks tell you system QB's don't pan out, he's chopped liver.  The kid has all of the tools, he just needs time to develop, which we can give him.  There are plenty of system QB's that have learned the pro game and have become successful at the pro level with time and development.  Mariota, per his coaches and other coaches around the league, has the character to become that guy.  Work ethic, body type, mental make up.  Or, in your scenario, we can give up multiple first rounders next year and the year after to take a kid, who by this time next year might be out of favor with the Mel Kiper Jrs of the world and start him immediately, because you're not giving up that much and starting Geno Smith again.  That'll really give the rookie plenty of time to develop, oh I forgot he's going to be coming out of a pro system so he'll already be really good, just like EJ Manuel."
nyjets,32g4fn,subrhyme,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:15:13 2015 UTC,"No, I wouldn't touch Mariota with a ten foot pole. I think he is really fucking good. But not for us or our system. We don't have a Farve or Manning to mentor him. We don't have patient fans who will let him develop. We don't have the attitude. That's the difference. I've never once said I wanted Mariota. I l went to a PAC12 school, and i know how Oregon QBs are. I don't give a fuck about Mel Kiper or any of them. You're wasting a draft pick and ruining Mariota if you we get him, fans like you wont' let him develop. You're more concerned with going with flash and when it doesn't pan out you immediately turn on the player, as noted with Geno. Because if we are going to pick isolated games to define Geno and what's been going on then Geno is the greatest QB of all time as seen in the Dolphins game when he had a perfect passer rating. The truth is inbetween though. Thanks to Ryan and the fustercluck that our Offense has been the past two years he hasn't had a chance to develop. Our OC had no confidence in him and it hurt his development. Geno can be an above average QB given the chance to have consistency and actual players around him. We have those players. We have the great defense to not force him to carry games. We have the chance to see what geno can do without pressuring him with an heir apparent that all our fans will call for(and you i'm sure) the moment he throws one interception. We have the opportunity to take BPA, but, naaaaaah let's draft Mariota because......it's a total typical Jet thing to do.You're reasoning is exactly while we go through this circle jerk every 3 years."
nyjets,32g4fn,John_YJKR,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:29:28 2015 UTC,"Politely, you're wrong in your assessment of me.  I was the last guy at the stadium saying Mark Sanchez is our QB.  I was on the Geno Bandwagon all last year and the year before, I was the only guy, maybe you were there too but I didn't see you.  2 years is an eternity in the NFL.  If you honestly think I am assessing Geno Smith's career on his performance in the Bills game then I apologize for my lack of candor.  I've watched every game he's played in the NFL and that is how I've come to my conclusion that he isn't fit to be an NFL QB.  If you're watching something different than I am I need to talk to your ophthalmologist, get me a pair of those glasses.    The Reason I think Mariota is the pick is exactly opposite of how you are assessing my motives.  You say I want to go with a flash, you're wrong.  I actually was against the pick before the Jets went out and bought the farm in Free Agency.  Most if not all of our Major needs have been addressed, except QB.  The reason I like the pick now is exactly what you said, we can finally develop a QB.  We don't need to throw him on the field and hope he pans out.  If the Jets Draft Mariota and alert the fan base that he will not start from the get go, they buy themselves a year with the kid.  If Geno starts and falls on his face you put in Fitzpatrick or vice/versa.  The only way Mariota sees the field is if he comes into camp and puts on a Russel Wilson show or Geno and Fitz collectively break 3 legs, and even then you might consider waiting until the 4th is broken.  If we wait another year to draft Hackenburg or Cook or Jones then you have to start them right away and we're back at square one.  If we're looking for a QB next year that means we lost another year under Geno.  If we take Mariota this year the ball is in motion and he's ready to take over next year.  Or Geno comes out and is fantastic (long shot but it could happen) and then you have yourself a really good problem with Mariota on the bench.      Another good reason to draft him this year is we've improved the team enough that a first round pick isn't going to make or break this team.  The only position that NEEDS and instant upgrade is QB.  Sure we could use an edge rusher, but we were 6th in the league last year in sacks.  Could we use and offensive lineman, yup but is it going to change the complexion of the team that drastically if we get one?  Not likely.  The best teams in the league have a franchise QB, we don't.  We need one.. Drafting one is the only way we get one.  Go Get One."
nyjets,32g4fn,subrhyme,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:11:43 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I guess I just a) don't trust Mariota, and I'll probably eat crow on that where ever he goes, but I don't think he's as good as everyone says. He had a great supporting cast, and it elevated him to a high level. I just have huge doubts about system QBs. None of Leach's prospects(Go Cougs) nor the Oregon factory has thus far. I know Mariota isn't any of those guys, and I'll support the hell out of him if we draft him but I just don't trust Woody right now to not cave to the pressure and force Mariota into the game at Fitz' or Geno's first mess up. I also see the flashes that Geno has and think if given a legitimate chance he might turn into something. Again, I'm probably wrong there. Where I feel I'm not wrong though is that we should build through the trenches. Get a stout Oline that can protect our QB for the next decade. Look at Hasselback in 06. or Sanchez in 09-10. They were asked to manage behind a strong line and it brought them both success. I know the goal is to get a ring, and neither of them did that because they weren't true franchise QBs, but I just can't get on board with drafting a QB that high who isn't a sure thing like Luck."
nyjets,32g4fn,NannigarCire,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:33:32 2015 UTC,"The Problem is Luck comes around once a decade, maybe even less often.  The last QB that was that surefire coming out of the draft was Peyton Manning, and fuck the Colts for getting both of those sons of bitches.  You need to take chances sometimes, we've been drafting defense for a decade."
nyjets,32g4fn,John_YJKR,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:45:19 2015 UTC,"We had the best free agency, but our signings were mostly older players.. If you want to draft mariota and sit him, by the time he is developed, players like Brandon Marshall, Cro, possibly Revis, could be gone. Not to mention guys Mangold, Brick, Pace, Babin.   We have a winning team right now, and we have two quarterbacks who will only have to not lose games.   I want our first round pick to have an immediate effect on our team because this team this year could be pretty nuts."
nyjets,32g4fn,subrhyme,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:41:32 2015 UTC,"all of those guys are going to leave next year?... Jeez, those are some pretty stupid contracts."
nyjets,32g4fn,John_YJKR,1 point,Wed Apr 15 12:33:19 2015 UTC,"We can completely draft a QB, but we'll go through the same bullshit scenario we've gone through the last 6 years by throwing somebody into a position which they're not ready to fill. And how is Oday not a poor man's Iupati? They're both agile enough to play on the outside but have horrible pass blocking and good run blocking. Drawing the equivalency isn't too far of a stretch, unless you're comparing 2nd year Oday to 5th year Iupati.   I like your list, but obviously we disagree on the importance of QB.  I believe we signed a blocking TE this offseason, but I could be misremembering that."
nyjets,32g4fn,subrhyme,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:15:29 2015 UTC,"See, I think if you draft Mariota or Winston, depending on who is available, this year it affords you the opportunity to sit them and teach them the game.  Unless of course they come into camp and light it on fire.  The Jets brass, should they draft a QB at #6, needs to tell the fan base that the new QB isn't starting no matter what.  Then if they start Fitz and he sucks they can insert Geno or Vice/Versa.  This is the first year in a long time that the Jets could actually pull that off.  If they wait until next year and the current crop of QB's doesn't get it done, then they will have to fill the position immediately with the young draft pick.    The Iupati reference is silly because Iupati was good from day 1.  Obushi isn't good.  I'll give him an OK.  He's OK."
nyjets,32g4fn,John_YJKR,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:31:49 2015 UTC,I completely agree that these QBs (along with most any other rookie QBs) should be sat until they are comfortable in the NFL.   But I really don't think that can work in the New York market. You can't draft Mariota and sit him because at the first sign of trouble the media shit storm will be swift.   We are an impatient race of fans and it bites us a bit when we rush our young QBs. See: Geno Smith.
nyjets,32g4fn,subrhyme,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:11:41 2015 UTC,"Well the Jets brass has to learn how to handle PR then.  After the Draft you make it abundantly clear that he will not start this year and your two horses are Fitz and Geno... Then you stick to that plan... and keep reinforcing the nature of the plan.  The good thing about the Fitzpatrick signing is he's not a bad QB, he'll win you some games and if he doesn't, you could shove him down our throats for 8-9 games before we start to revolt and then start Geno Smith for the last 7 or 8 with the idea that we need to see if he's good enough to be our guy, or trade bait... If we ever want to get ourselves a franchise QB we need to be able to display patience with our young QB's.  The definition of crazy is repeating the same action over and over and expecting different results.."

nyjets,32ctms,Forty-Three,2,Sun Apr 12 19:59:55 2015 UTC,"How does one go about getting their instagram and twitters hacked, exactly? Was it a salty computer savvy patriots fan or a amped up jets fan with a rooted smartphone trying to make a point?   Such bullshit. Just own it. Nobody is going around and hacking instagrams."
nyjets,32ctms,tate_wilson,5,Sun Apr 12 23:43:46 2015 UTC,I got an email the other day saying mine was hacked and I'm nobody.
nyjets,32ctms,dsjersey24,3,Mon Apr 13 00:54:07 2015 UTC,"I mean, I suppose it's a possibility, but it just seems odd that every time a celebrity or athlete runs off at the mouth on social media and says something they shouldn't, they claim that they were hacked."
nyjets,32ctms,BigNuke43,4,Mon Apr 13 08:23:35 2015 UTC,"I used to be a big PC gamer and I never had 1 account hacked. Ever. Never have viruses etc. Well I made a twitter in 2009ish and stopped using it about a year later. About 2 years ago, I went to delete it, and there was a solid year of russian links to whatever. How it got hacked I will never know. They probably just have incredibly shitty security."
nyjets,32ctms,shoelaces232,2,Mon Apr 13 11:29:33 2015 UTC,"Well hey, look at all of the attention it got. I'm pretty sure that is what like 99% of hackers care about in the first place haha"
nyjets,32ctms,botticus51,2,Mon Apr 13 13:16:19 2015 UTC,Isis hacks twitter accounts. You'd be surprised haha
nyjets,32ctms,piratefuck,3,Mon Apr 13 00:27:11 2015 UTC,Yes they do
nyjets,32ctms,justafIeshwound,2,Mon Apr 13 01:52:48 2015 UTC,Aww...
nyjets,32ctms,chris_ri,2,Sun Apr 12 18:44:28 2015 UTC,I'm just going to keep believing that Revis shit all over those Pats fans.

nyjets,32ctms,TweetPoster,0,Sun Apr 12 18:39:43 2015 UTC,He wasn't hacked. He probably got drunk and had enough with retarded fans on social media. I don't even blame him for it. Just like I don't blame him for taking the money. Everyone would have done the same thing. Just wish he'd be honest about it. The hack thing is such a weak cop-out.

nyjets,32ctms,Thx4TheDwnVote,2,Mon Apr 13 09:26:18 2015 UTC,@LearnedCitizen   2015-04-12 19:36 UTC  @BenVolin Hi Ben. Do you think Revis was truly hacked? I was told he has a history of making posts like this. [Attached pic] [Imgur rehost]     This message was created by a bot  [Contact creator][Source code]
nyjets,32cboq,kidluke311,30,Sun Apr 12 16:05:37 2015 UTC,"There is no way this was actually Revis, right? It doesn't seem like something he would do."
nyjets,32cboq,tiguta,18,Sun Apr 12 16:39:07 2015 UTC,Unless somebody else gained access to his account it is definitely him...and he is still going...  http://imgur.com/a/EZP3D
nyjets,32cboq,brad_smiths_shoe,32,Sun Apr 12 16:47:24 2015 UTC,Woman go do your hair & make up & go play with Barbie dolls. Stay out of two men having a conversation   Gotta be hacked
nyjets,32cboq,ZedSpot,9,Sun Apr 12 17:17:07 2015 UTC,"I can kinda get behind the other trash talk,  but shit... now I hope it isn't him."
nyjets,32cboq,brad_smiths_shoe,5,Sun Apr 12 18:09:07 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing but the account has 170k followers...  https://instagram.com/revisislandtwo4/
nyjets,32cboq,stifflers_list,26,Sun Apr 12 16:46:02 2015 UTC,According to his twitter he said his Instagram was hacked.  https://twitter.com/Revis24/status/587308245406081024
nyjets,32cboq,tokeyoh,19,Sun Apr 12 17:39:43 2015 UTC,Such a good way to cover his ass if he was itchin to talk shit though

nyjets,32cboq,JohnnyVNCR,21,Sun Apr 12 17:39:54 2015 UTC,I'm just gonna pray that's not him. Mainly for the sake of grammar.
nyjets,32cboq,papi_chulo83,7,Sun Apr 12 16:58:58 2015 UTC,theres no way its him. Some of the shit thats being said would REALLY hurt him publicly
nyjets,32cboq,banana455,13,Sun Apr 12 18:35:43 2015 UTC,He sounds like a fucking idiot. Highly doubt this is him
nyjets,32cboq,Clown_Shoe,6,Sun Apr 12 17:25:53 2015 UTC,Yea I used to follow him when I was into twitter and he was way more well spoken.  Definitely not him.
nyjets,32cboq,Tecul,9,Sun Apr 12 18:38:17 2015 UTC,No way in shit this is actually him.
nyjets,32cboq,Davy_Grolton,32,Sun Apr 12 17:16:20 2015 UTC,That's my cornerback
nyjets,32cboq,snufalufalgus,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:27:20 2015 UTC,He was ours for just long enough.
nyjets,32cboq,thisistrue1234,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:57:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm it almost definitely isn't ""our cornerback"" considering it is clearly a hacked account...  On top of that, would this really have been a moment of pride? Our cornerback talking about his big dick and how he thinks women should stay in the kitchen as a comeback to random trolls?"
nyjets,32cboq,lwI,0,Sun Apr 12 21:38:03 2015 UTC,Yes

nyjets,32cboq,blinkme123,4,Sun Apr 12 19:35:35 2015 UTC,This sounds like an 8th grader sitting in his basement. I highly doubt it was actually him.
nyjets,32cboq,azzjuice,12,Sun Apr 12 19:05:19 2015 UTC,I don't like this. It comes off as weak and small
nyjets,32cboq,LennyLongshoes,8,Sun Apr 12 17:09:44 2015 UTC,His account is obviously hacked but great job nonetheless.
nyjets,32cboq,xenonprime,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:43:44 2015 UTC,"But then how can you ""hack"" something and sound like an idiot."
nyjets,32cboq,ZedSpot,2,Sun Apr 12 20:02:18 2015 UTC,Be 12 perhaps?
nyjets,32cboq,domsanti,4,Sun Apr 12 21:38:41 2015 UTC,I just wish I could help him out with some of that grammar.
nyjets,32cboq,Asian-Jesus,4,Sun Apr 12 17:26:46 2015 UTC,I hope this isn't him. Highly unprofessional.
nyjets,32cboq,HUGHmungous,5,Sun Apr 12 19:54:17 2015 UTC,"Damn, he must be having a bad day. He doesn't seem like the type to go crazy on social media."
nyjets,32cboq,Sir_Duke94,5,Sun Apr 12 16:39:12 2015 UTC,I think I'm starting to fall for him again
nyjets,32cboq,BigNuke43,2,Sun Apr 12 16:17:34 2015 UTC,"In the immortal words of Good Ol' JR, ""THAT MAN'S GOT A FAMILY, DAMN IT!"".  Leave a rose."
nyjets,32cboq,KIM_JONG_1Ls_DONKEY,2,Sun Apr 12 16:38:25 2015 UTC,I'd be embarrassed if I was him with the way he's talking. You're a professional. Act like one.
