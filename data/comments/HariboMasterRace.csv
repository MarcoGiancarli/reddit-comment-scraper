HariboMasterRace,3dpf17,Marslettuce,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:23:43 2015 UTC,I just looked and I can get a 5 lb bag of them on Amazon for $20. I wonder how much it will cost to then ship this bag to you in Canada?..
HariboMasterRace,3dpf17,Harrypottersmom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:02:21 2015 UTC,"You can't order from amazon.com in Canada. Even if I use a proxy, it won't let me input my address."

HariboMasterRace,3bma6p,Madejyalook,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:33:08 2015 UTC,You can get them in Germany as well. The text on the packaging is in german so it might be exported from Germany.

HariboMasterRace,34ydkt,ultrakryptonite,14,Tue May 5 16:13:46 2015 UTC,"Gold Bears are the gateway drug to the greatest gummies on earth. The European varieties are the best (like Starmix or BRICK) so check out your specialty candy store for a different selection. At the grocery store, Haribo Fruit Salad is one of my faves because I like a variety of flavors. Fruity-Fruitti (or whatever they're called) are like an upscale version of Gushers and they're amazing. Frogs, peaches, Sharks... You can't go wrong, really. Unless you get licorice spins. Sorry Europe, but those are terrible."

Fruit Salad Peaches Pink Grapefruit Grapefruit   Regarding licorice spins, while your personal preference regarding black licorice may vary, it isn't Haribo's greatest strength and is something done better by the Dutch and Scandinavians."

HariboMasterRace,34ydkt,Th3BlackLotus,1 point,Wed May 6 05:06:11 2015 UTC,"I've seen those, but I'm rather new so I've only gotten the Bears and the Cola bottles"
HariboMasterRace,34ydkt,robinthebum,1 point,Wed May 6 06:41:20 2015 UTC,"Peaches are SO DAMN GOOD. They're the only Haribo I saw in the US that we don't really get as much here in the UK. I saw them in tons of shops whilst over the pond, but I've only seen them being sold in maybe 2 places in London?"
HariboMasterRace,34ydkt,buice,5,Wed May 6 08:13:40 2015 UTC,"Wait, hold on here - I could certainly be wrong, but I am fairly confident that Haribo does not make peach rings.    They do make ""Peaches"", which are fantastic (although over time the smell can wear on a fella) - but the rings (e.g. ""Peachie Os"") are made by other companies such as Trolli and imo are vastly inferior.  One is not like another"
