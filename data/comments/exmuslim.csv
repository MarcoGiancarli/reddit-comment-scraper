It's illiberal to not defend someone's right to practice Islam. Freedom of religion and all that stuff. Also because it's unfair to Muslims that don't do anything that ISIS does and still get ridiculed for what ISIS does. Should all white people be ridiculed because of what the KKK does? Should all white people have to denounce KKK and all racists? Why should they have to answer for someone else's actions?  Also liberal  != atheist/agnostic

If you throw out Hadith in Bukhari, you might as well start throwing out everything else too (which is what scholars like Ignaz Goldziher and Patricia Crone have actually done).   Bukhari is the earliest Hadith book (200 years after Muhammad) other than ibn Hanbal's Musnad (which does not have the same status as the Six Books). Sunni scholarship unanimously accepts it as the most correct book after the Quran; the entire Sharia is built on Hadith from the Six Books, of which Bukhari and Muslim sit on top.

This thread has a Muslim trying to make that apologist argument and citing muslim.org. Spoilers: He doesn't do very well.   Muslims who cling to the revisionist attempts are just insecure and ashamed of the marriage - a good thing ultimately but lying to yourself and ignoring the majority of scholars is pretty dumb.

However, the sheer numbers of such muslims are extremely low and this all hinges on what you define as muslim. For example, being contrary to the ummah itself can be viewed as apostasy. My point is that as a religion Islam cannot be revised so that homosexuals are not condemned and that most muslims will not support homosexuals and homosexuality because a certain level of freedom to believe and interpret Islam to their own codes and understandings is not given in Islam nor in Islamic culture. Furthermore, with the rise in secularism and continued localisation of specific ideologies such as Islam (decrease in spread) I do not envision a world in the future where muslims are accepting of homosexuality."

exmuslim,3e3nju,scientus,2,Tue Jul 21 20:32:10 2015 UTC,"Islam does not believe that, or not exactly that. You were born to desire same sex relationships but you should never act on that desire. What you desire is also bad and wrong and a sin. I have heard it described this way. You may desire to drink alcohol, but you can't, you may desire to have sex with people who you are not married to, but you can't, you may desire something as simple as to wear shorts when it's cold (as a woman) but you can't, because it's a  sin. Since Islam is so restrictive, restricting a  person's desire to be gay is just another way in which god tells you to curb natural desires to be what he or she wants you to be. I.e. we are born to desire things that god does not want us to do and to act on those desires makes us sinners. Being gay and never acting on it, is the only acceptable way to be queer in Islam."

exmuslim,3e2g5r,Ralphishere123,17,Tue Jul 21 13:10:20 2015 UTC,"Spent 7 years at Madrassah and 5 years learning under a personal Imam during school. After school I studied it informally in a personal capacity, reading books, reading the Quran, the Hadith, studying where it all came from and how it all connects etc. I never stopped since then. I'm still going.  Studying Islam is what actually made me change my mind. For many years I studied it convinced that it was the truth. Eventually I was confronted with far too many things that convinced me that it wasn't. I think if I never studied it, I'd still be a Muslim.  What do I think of the counter arguments for all claims against Islam? Almost all of them are appeal to faith or authority. We must take it on faith that the Quran is perfectly preserved, we must take it on faith that the Ulama have got their judgments right, we must take it on faith that Bukhari and the others preserved Muhammad's words and deeds. The evidence is stacked against the contrary. The other class of arguments is: ""You don't understand"", often presented as ""You're taking it out of context"" or ""It makes more sense in Arabic"". This to me is more an argument against Islam than for it. Why is God purposely making his words so hard to understand and confusing people? Often the context ends up making things worse. E.g. when you find out that not only is slavery allowed, but Muhammad personally sanctioned his people taking female captives as sexual slaves."
exmuslim,3e2g5r,CadmeusCain,4,Tue Jul 21 13:45:29 2015 UTC,"So I have a genuine follow up question...you studied quite some time and I'm sure you feel you are relatively knowledgeable about Islam.  Do you think other scholars got it wrong, if so where? Do you think they're deliberately blinding themselves to inconsistencies?  Or do you think you have more to go and perhaps you might end up back at some religion in the future?"
exmuslim,3e2g5r,CadmeusCain,18,Tue Jul 21 13:54:29 2015 UTC,"you studied quite some time and I'm sure you feel you are relatively knowledgeable about Islam.   Pretty knowledgeable. I'm still learning and ready to learn more.   Do you think other scholars got it wrong, if so where?   I don't like to say ""I'm right and everyone else is wrong"". This is arrogant and foolish. Instead, I think one's conclusion on the data depends on what assumptions one is starting with. Essentially, what epistemology you're subscribing to. I consider myself an empirical skeptic. Before I can believe something, I need some kind of evidence. The greater the claim, the greater the evidence.  For example:   Someone says: ""I like this book"". I'll take their word for it. Someone says: ""This book is good"". I'll probably read it or check reviews. Someone says: ""This book is the uncreated eternal word of God himself and could not have been produced by a human being, let alone an illiterate one in 600CE Arabia"". Now I'm going go go through this book with a fine-toothed comb asking questions about every discrepancy, every inaccuracy, every problem. I'm going to look up who this guy is, how do we know he's telling the truth, are there other explanations. I want to cover all possible angles before I can accept that a God wrote it.   I think I used a much stronger standard of evidence than most Islamic scholars. When I studied Islamic scholarly opinion on many of the questions I asked, they decided that it was sufficient to trust that the first generation of Muslims compiled the Quran correctly, to trust that they memorized it perfectly, to trust that Bukhari and co. collected the authentic Hadith, discarded the fabrications and preserved Islam in its true form, to trust that Muhammad was infallible. I could not have this trust without good reason.   By my standards, I found evidence that the Quran is not perfectly preserved, that Bukhari and his buddies got many things wrong, that there were disputes among the first generation of Muslims as to what goes in the Quran and what doesn't and that Muhammad made many mistakes.  This approach also applies to miracle claims. If someone is telling me that Muhammad flew to heaven on a magic pony, it is not sufficient for the story to exist for me to believe it. I need hardcore evidence. Some people claim they can levitate or read minds. Some people claim they saw Jesus rise from the dead with their own eyes. When people come with these extraordinary claims, I treat them all the same: bring me your evidence if it's true. Often when we actually investigate, we find that the claim is bunk. For instance: there is no evidence that Abraham or Moses existed, no evidence that there ever was a global flood (actually there is evidence against it).   Do you think they're deliberately blinding themselves to inconsistencies?   I think they use an inconsistent standard of evidence. They accept many things in Islam on faith, but they would not accept things from Christianity, Judaism, Jainism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism etc. on the same standards. e.g. Hindus too believe that the Vedas were written in language that no human being could ever produce, yet Muslim scholars don't accept the claim with the same confidence as they do for their own holy books. They will criticize the Gospels for being written 100 years after Jesus was born, but will accept Hadith and biographies compiled 200 years after Muhammad died etc.   Or do you think you have more to go and perhaps you might end up back at some religion in the future?   I could always be wrong. I am probably wrong about a lot of things now. I will keep studying religion for the rest of my life likely. I am willing to change my mind if I find something that warrants it. So far, every single day I learn that something that makes it even less likely that Islam, or any of the Abrahamic religions are true."

One sheikh would try to laugh off my arguments by dubbing me a ""mshkaljeeyah"" (spelling?) which basically means trouble-maker. Despite acknowledging so many things I straight out did not agree with or felt very strongly against, I always managed to push the doubts out of my mind and tried to seek comfort in the thought that just because I didn't understand something doesn't mean it didn't make sense, and that God knows best and I (and all the sheikhs and scholars) were just misunderstanding things because God is not unjust and blah blah blah. I tricked myself into thinking that I knew more than my teachers about Islam in my own progressive modern way and would blame the way they saw it as influence from growing up in their arab cultures, and I was the one that /truly/ saw it without biased cultural influence (totally ignoring the fact that the West was influencing me to see it in a more acceptable, progressive way). Now, I can look at what I was told by my teachers and sheikhs and recognize that I was the one twisting things, not them, and trying to make them fit into what I thought Islam SHOULD be, not what it was.  I didn't know there WERE any counter-arguments to Islam, I didn't think they existed, because whenever I would stumble upon one someone would tell me to ""be careful about where I get information from"" because there are a lot of people on the internet trying to ""defame"" Islam, so I would chalk up any argument to that and not pay it much attention.

So basing the ""truth"" of Islam on its spread must take into account that a great majority of Muslims don't follow Islam.

That club was a club in which the Muslim girls changed to suggestive outfits like short dresses and high heels. They would change back to their hijabs and modest clothing in the bathroom  before heading back home. This also made me feel awkward. I saw hijabi girls making out with men in the club. It was like they were leading a double life. Surprisingly enough, she also asked me if I am interested in hooking up with any of the non-moose men there.

I understand you're going through a lot right now but clearly you made the right choice to ask for help.   I come from an Arab family as well and I can tell you from experience that you should not expect any empathy from them the way you expect. Our generation is at a great disconnect from the previous one since we were taught to juggle both the Arab meaning of love and the western one. Don't expect kind words from your family. Your parents saying that God has a plan for you and still loves you is the equivalent of saying you will be alright and we're here to support you.   I stopped caring about the western idea of love when it comes to interacting with my family because I have been hurt so much in the past. The only way for you to get better is to let go of the past hate and anger you have towards the religion and culture and to flip a new page where you are the author. Brush off all the negativity and start a new life. You will find some positivity in this when you realise that she was probably not the one for you from the beginning.   Now that you let all that go, smile more. Fake it till you make it has been my motto ever since I left the religion and it has helped me cope with things my past self would have made a fuss about.

It won't do anything and repressing emotions will make it worse.  Cry as much as you have to. Let all those emotions out. Look how muslims act when they are sexually repressed? Rapey animals. If you hold in emotions, you may end up exploding one day in anger. No point in that. Cry as much as you have to. Eventually, you will get over it. It's just natural.

It could be more ambitious like going back to education to solidify a better career maybe or I find relationships tend to keep you back from a better career.   Tell your family you have no interest in Islam. No point whining on the internet about your situation if you yourself are not willing to make progress.

He is not a machine, it takes a while to get over it, and you need the support of people who can fathom the level of pain you are experiencing, a physical pain so horrible that a person who ""had it all"" a few months ago would contemplate ending his life because of it.   Luckily, I don't think OP will go ahead with that,but he needs something other than ""man up and move on""  at this stage."
exmuslim,3e1om9,sackwenga,2,Tue Jul 21 14:23:34 2015 UTC,Of course I have...my advice is from experience and anecdotes. I was with someone I loved and thought it was the one. Turned out not to be. I was crushed but life goes on and we have to get on with life.   I went back to education and furthered myself. I traveled and got some culture. I built myself up by balancing career and life away from work. Eventually I found someone and I've been married 4 years now and have a boy of 1 year and 3 months and a little girl on the way.  The last thing one needs when crushed is to wallow in self pity and lean on people on the internet for help.

His brain is probably in withdrawal mode still, and the priority would be to mitigate that and not let it spill onto other areas (professional, social) of his life so as not to make matters even worse.

We drove up to Canada then came back to the U.S via a remote (no other people there) border crossing late at night (one of those empty states no one goes to, where they likely only see White people). The US guards were like wtf? Questioned the shit out of us but then sent us on our way.   We flew back to our home state from a small airport in this state, again remote airport where you would only see White people. Did get stares but no one said anything, they just patted my wife's head as she went through screening but were very nice about it. It was just bloody awkward as everyone was staring at us."

My mom even stopped wearing her hijab for a couple years.  I remember a couple months ago, I went on YikYak, that one mobile app that lets you post and view anonymous stuff in your area, and I saw posts saying 'Kill all Muslims' and berating Pakistanis and the hijabis that go to our school and it got a lot of upvotes, and no one disagreed, everyone agreed.

exmuslim,3e0e54,factually_accurate_1,2,Tue Jul 21 15:32:55 2015 UTC,"Not that it matters, but this is how they actually determine the direction.. The direction of prayer takes into account the curvature of Earth. It is not a straight line on the map. All scholars, not the stupid ones at least, agree with that. See the website. http://eqibla.com/  On a separate note, I always thought Allah himself resides in Kaaba. Otherwise, why would he be pissed off when the elephant was going to knock it down.

Sorry but that means whoever invented this practice did not know the earth was a sphere and did not know the difference between and arc and a vector. When you face a place you face a direction from where you are. Saying that prayer goes around the surface of the earth is silly...why wouldn t it be able to go through the earth instead? Why? Because Mohammed had no idea the earth was a round planet... that is why.

Ofcourse they were inferior, they were between 700 to 3000 years behind in mankind's ability to write, spread and understand written information. Or perhaps, was Allah, in all his mightiness, limited by the inferiority of his own creation?  Could he not have given mankind the tools to learn and write then?"

As far as Islam is concerned, the revelation is complete, the religion has been perfected, the Quran has all the answers and everything worth saying has already been said.  Why even bother living anymore? According to Islam, nothing anyone does after Muhammad will ever reach his greatness and nothing could possibly be learned that will never surpass the Quran or Islam's teachings. In a way, Islam is anti-progress. It closes the door by claiming that perfection and ultimate wisdom was attained before you were even born.

I think Iranian authorities are very religious. The president is a very high status cleric and the parliament is populated with very religious people. I don't think there's much pretending going on when it comes to religion, if anything those who act less religious are lying to attract  votes from more progressive people.     Islam is thought from elementary school but it's pretty much confined to theology class and it doesn't affect other classes. Students who don't believe can't come out because it's risky for many reasons.   Iranians are very religious people. Those who follow Shia Islam generally believe that Shia Islam is the only true way. Shia Iranians are tolerant of Sunnis and Christians but they don't treat Baha'is and Jews very well. I don't know what Sunni Iranians and other sects think about these issues.

exmuslim,3dyi0v,wazzym,13,Mon Jul 20 15:55:38 2015 UTC,"Muslims enslaved all races. As long as they were not Muslim they are slaves. If they convert to Islam they become ""free"" I say ""free"" because a Muslim  and non Muslim slaves nowadays are called ""Sabee""(literally means boy) or ""Sabiya"" (girl) this slave is treated like kind of like an adopted member of the family, they live in the house however they are not allowed to take the name, or do anything that are not approved by the family, it is also legal to beat them up and torture them if you desire, if you end up killing them you have to send their family money. They are basically slaves in things except name and this is what middle east has at the moment. In Kuwait they're legal under a contract and perhaps a lot of south asians over here know this.    In Saudi Arabia they're treated even worse. There are countless of videos online of Saudis beating or even killing those people and this isn't a small thing. Almost every single house in the Gulf have a "" khadim "" (servant) in it. And a lot of them have a Sabee.   Difference between a Khadim and a Sabee is that A khadim is typically a worker who is brought in by working visa that stays for a limited time and all that. (typically 5 years, and is payed monthly)  A Sabee is a poor person who probably didn't have money at all to even have a passport and is taken in like an adoption, they typically stay until they die, and are not payed monthly they are given money like how a kid gets his money. Depending if the giver is kind or not. Of course most people who own a Sabee are vile people who barely give them enough money to buy a pair of shoes.   Yes, slavery is still a growing business over here, it is just called something else because the word for slave in Arabic is ""Abd"" and Muslims consider everyone slave of Allah (Abdullah)  Edit: for an extra kicker, the word ""Abd"" is also used to describe black people. And it is used very casually. Imagine if in America white people casually used the word ""slave"" to refer to black people? Yeah that's how it is in here. And all these black people converting to Islam out of sheer hatred to white people are funny. Zinji (Negro) is also used very often, but the word negro is not something black people over here find offensive. And it should not he offensive in the west either because it's your race and you should be proud of it not censor it like your race name Is voldemort."

And because of that every prophet in a way would be preoccupied in setting the perfect example of the messages revealed. You know how the entire ummah look up to Mohammed and emulate his life and teachings right?   This is not the case of mere mortals like you or me. This is the practices of a dude highly revered in the Islamic doctrine. You know the dude whose soul was ""created in heaven beforehand"" because that's how much he is also worshipped. Like if I was God and the person I sent down to be the last prophet was doing this (i.e. slavery). Then it means one of two things, either God allows it so why are you denying something revealed by God to be okay, therefore what kind of merciful God allows this, especially it being the last message to mankind.

exmuslim,3e0hlp,FreedomIsHere,5,Tue Jul 21 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"I read the whole article.   So is there any gay liberal scholar who'll write against this kind of article?  'cause you know, they will rob your freedom if you don't fight back.  And the author doesn't even have a leg to stand on, equating tumblr feminists with real life feminists."
exmuslim,3e0hlp,Vallentain,6,Tue Jul 21 02:55:09 2015 UTC,"Problems I see in the article:  In his argument against otherkin, and his following extension of it to homosexuality, he claims he is correct in disparaging them and their views because ""[it is] ludicrous."" He has no objective ground to stand on with that argument.  And this ties closely to his main message. His argument about morality and laws governing it appears to be based on human intuition. But such human intuition deviates from person to person. Who is to say that the anti-homosexuality group has the ""correct"" intuition?  He dances around the topic of consent, saying it is a null issue because other things like incest and consensual cannibalism have no relation to that and yet are banned due to society's intuitive disgust of it. I disagree; incest has higher risk of birth defects, and cannibalism necessitates the death of someone, bringing into question suicide and euthanasia ethics.  Tl;Dr his argument appears to be ""eww, homosexuality is icky, I think almost everyone else thinks so too (not because of societal influence of course), and because morality is relative, this view should be enforced by law where applicable.""  DISCLAIMER: I'm not so good with the big words. Nor do I have a great attention span, especially when it comes to religious stuff. My understanding of the article may be quite poor. That said, I'd love a healthy discussion/debate, even from a devil's advocate."

exmuslim,3e0hlp,Vallentain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:35:15 2015 UTC,"I read the whole article.    Sympathies. I read about half.   In this way, conventional Western liberal attitudes about human desire are not based on any robust, objective theory of human nature. Without such a theory, there is no basis for liberals to claim that their sexual mores are more in line with natural human desire as opposed to, say, Islamic ones.   And what is the non-western 'theory of human nature' ?  The nature of self awareness / consciousness (the nature of humanity) is a mystery that science doesn't even know where to begin to investigate. The non religious has the intellectual honesty to state/admit this.  Revealed religion (Abrahamic religion) on the other hand, chooses one of a myriad of made up fantasy narratives and declares themselves (at minimum) the sole possessors of access to morality, access to the knowledge of what is 'good' and what is 'evil'. Sometimes they state themselves to be the only ones who are 'moral' and possess 'goodness'.  The islamic narrative allows the believers to rape slave girls, marry and rape nine year olds, dominate/oppress non-believers and take their stuff, control women, have multiple wives without reciprocity and incidentally kill homosexuals.   Each nation has created a god, and the god has always resembled his creators. He hated and loved what they hated and loved, and he was invariably found on the side of those in power. Each god was intensely patriotic, and detested all nations but his own. All these gods demanded praise, flattery, and worship. Most of them were pleased with sacrifice, and the smell of innocent blood has ever been considered a divine perfume.  - Robert G. Ingersoll, The Gods, New York 1880   .  He tries to imply that homosexuality is not natural.  Anyone with only cursory knowledge about the human genome understands that LGBT is absolutely inevitable because each and every person carries close to 100% 'male' and also 100% 'female' genetic information.  To avoid the existence of LGBT one would need to supernaturally interfere and adjust (suspending the laws of nature) in the development of a person about to become LGBT.  I'd add, even if it wasn't natural, I don't care, consenting adults etc..."

exmuslim,3dy4r3,ShangZilla,7,Mon Jul 20 15:25:55 2015 UTC,"You need to put Earth's history in a single day to make the impression you want.  My Mother is a Jehovah's Witness. Her cult believes the world is sick and depraved and getting worse, and that all this is predicted in the Bible. The way I handle her outrageous claims is to tell her to simply look outside her door. Walk around her neighborhood. Look at the nearest city. Are people being raped and murdered where she lives? Has the rate of violent crime risen or dropped since she was a kid? How many murders were there last year?  Things are getting better and better all the time. This isn't empty rhetoric, it is plain fact for those who know where to look for the data.  It's the same with the environment. Of course we have been polluting it since the industrial revolution. Of course there are more cars on the road now. Of course the landfills are overflowing with waste. Of course we are depleting resources at an alarming rate.  But it's getting better. Remember the pejorative 'tree hugger'? That's pretty much everyone these days. Awareness of what our lifestyles and societies cost the planet is at an all-time high. Automobiles are more efficient than they have ever been, and getting moreso. Factories are retrofitting to be cheaper on energy and lower in waste production. Fish stocks are being closely monitored and moratoriums are put in place where they are in danger. Politicians must show they are planning for a greener tomorrow in order to get votes. Big business is demonized for what it has done to the environment, and consumers are voting which ones survive with their patronage. Renewable energy is the term for our new century.  Things need to get visibly bad before people will act. But it's important to remember how much we have accomplished and not let the magnitude of the problems overwhelm us. The future looks a lot brighter than it did a mere decade ago.  And religion is dying. People are abandoning the systems of belief that gave them majical sky-hook solutions, and realizing that we have one life to live, and it is up to us to fix our issues if they are to be fixed at all. Apathy has always been the enemy, and apathy was the most disheartening aspect of our problems. Apathy has been replaced with informed action now."

Peoples actions and speech have consequences and people should be smart enough to discern what is safe to do and what's not.

Idealistically (which is the land where you must live) yes, people should wear whatever they want without consequence. But guess what?  This life isn't like that and as a rational father or mother, you tell her to dress appropriately to minimize the chance of anything bad happening to her.

Muslims hold onto their faith with so much certainty, it's normal for any human to accept whatever his/her parents teach them from a young age. People need to realize that religious people from other faiths feel exactly about their own religion as you do about yours.   Ask your dad to step back for one second and see how alien Arabic and the traditions of Islam would seem to some tribe living in the Amazon or even to someone brought up in Japan. Why should they study an alien language and culture they don't even understand? How would they live in the jungle  with hijab and beards? How could Eskimos live in their home territory and observe the rules of fasting/prayer based on sunrise/sunset?   Why would GOD torture a human being for simply following and believing whatever his or her parents showed them, we know that a child's brain is built to absorb whatever the adults teach it.   Why does a Muslim child raised in a religious house get to have a higher chance of eternal bliss? While another child born in Japan who followed his parents and rejected an alien culture , why would this child end up in hell? It's so stupid.  The vast majority of Muslims would reject and laugh at anyone claiming to have the “divine eternal truth” from some other part of the world, so why do they expect something different from other humans?"

Or is it because you are a Muslim, then there is no need for that anymore? Why do you expect others to read up on your religion, when you never bothered doing the same for theirs?

exmuslim,3dz9m3,truereligionapostate,2,Tue Jul 21 14:02:09 2015 UTC,"I'm 22 now. I've been financially independent since I was around 19. I define this as being able to afford to live on my own, and handle all expenses on my own.   Here's what I did.  I've been working and saving up since I was ~14. I took summer courses in high school, and was able to set up my senior year such that I only had one class, first thing in the morning. I used the rest of my day working a full time job in a stock room, and a part time job at an auto mechanic. I worked hard in high school, and got more than a full ride in scholarships. I didn't leave the city for school, so I saved big on expenses by staying at home. Worked hard in university too, and got jobs as a TA, research assistant etc. Early on in university, I started doing some amateur investing, mostly with the direction of my dad. I applied for co-op placements, and worked in the federal government for 12 months (on my 12th month now), full time with decent pay, while still doing TAships on the side. Both paid over 20/hr, which is pretty sweet for a non-STEM student. I got offered a regular position with a renegotiated pay (higher) in a large government department (the one I'm currently in), for September.  So, I'll be graduating in April 2016, with no debt, a good job lined up, hella references, and a ton of money saved/invested.  I really played my cards right, and had all the right luck. It doesn't fall from the sky, though. I worked really hard, sacrificed a lot, and inflicted a lot of hardship on myself because of the choices I made. It was very easy to slip into depression because of the choices I made/continue to make vis-à-vis work, school, and social life.   I'd suggest following this sort of path to exmooses in high school or early university wanting to get away from their home situation for good. The main thing I'd do differently is that I'd pay far better attention to my mental health. Having money is great and all, but it all seems pointless when you're depressed."

exmuslim,3dx6pl,vestayekta,7,Mon Jul 20 11:49:50 2015 UTC,"NASA's lunar calendar is irrelevant to Islamic lunar calendar which is based on moon sighting. It means that to declare Eid, moon should be seen with human eyes.   Muslims who live in different parts of the world may not see the moon at one night. This means that Muslims in KSA may not celebrate Eid the same night as Muslims in Bangladesh. Moreover, Muslims follow different authorities and they generally only celebrate Eid if their own authorities see the moon. This means that Muslims who live near each other may celebrate Eid on different dates."
exmuslim,3dx6pl,vestayekta,5,Mon Jul 20 07:39:22 2015 UTC,that seems to me like a really inaccurate way of doing things; since a few days after the true new moon (0% visibility) the moon is >4% visible which to the naked eye is still 0% visibility so it creates more than one day which Eid can be on.

Your dad sounds a lot like my dad.  And let me tell you, from one child of a monster to another, your dad sounds like a fucking monster.  Maybe he hasn't done anything illegal, but he espouses support for illegal, violent, and anti-intellectual acts, and he and his kind (like my father) are a menace to all of humanity.

exmuslim,3dvkbo,Vallentain,20,Sun Jul 19 23:20:03 2015 UTC,"I'm a tad hungover--so apologies for the forthcoming babble--but gladly.   Was born in the US to non-Israeli parents (mom was actually a Jewish convert), raised in New Jersey, attended an orthodox religious school until I was 18.  Was a bleeding heart zionist/right winger coming out of high school. Wasn't 'externally' too religious (i.e., in terms of doctrinal or ritual obedience) but I wholeheartedly believed that: the Jews were 'God's chosen' people, that Israel was our divinely bestowed 'holy land', the Israeli victory in the six day war was 'providence', and that the Palestinians/Arabs could go shove it.   After graduating high school, I ended up deferring my college admission to spend the year in the 'holy land' doing volunteer work/strengthening my Zionist roots. Ultimately, I fell in love with the place, relished the tribalism and the sense of belonging that I experienced living amongst 'my people', and wanted to do my part defending it from an onslaught of genocidal maniacs (i.e., the arabs/palestinians). Long story short, I forfeited my scholarship to my dream university and flew to Israel to volunteer for the next army draft (there's a program that allows foreign Jews to serve in the IDF). Was admitted into a combat unit (Nachal) where I served over 2 years, including deployments to the West Bank/Gaza/ and the Lebanese border.  Exited the army with the same 'black and white' Zionist mentality I brought with me.   Then I started university in Israel (political science) where I bumped heads with a lot of leftist professors/class-mates who I perceived as traitors. Nevertheless, I guess the accumulation of heated debates, exposure to diversity and contrarian literature, and the many professors who challenged my mindset, ultimately sowed the seeds of doubt, which culminated in serious introspection/existential crisis my senior year.  The watershed, interestingly, was my exposure to basic astronomy/cosmology via Carl Sagan/Stephen hawking. As embarrassing as it is to admit--though I guess I can blame my Orthodox education for this one--I had little idea that our sun was actually a star, one among trillions in the wider universe. It was that moment that it dawned on me that there's no way the Jews could have pride of place in a cosmos composed of an imponderable number of worlds/civilizations. None of it made sense anymore.  Once I started scrutinizing my Jewish faith/narrative, my skepticism ultimately traversed onwards to my politics/Zionism. Given the firebrand right-winger I was, it was a seismic transformation. Many of my like-minded friends were confused. I began my studies ready to spend the rest of my life in the holy land, six thousand miles away from my family, braving the biannual army reserve duty call-ups, potential wars etc.;  and I finished my graduate degree feeling intellectually 'alone' and ready to jump ship.  I just couldn't identify with the tribal mentality anymore. And if you're going to  live happily in Israel and endure the sacrifice, it's a must. But once my atheism/humanism was in full bloom, and I realized how petty/sanctimonious the Jewish 'meta-narrative' really was, the futility of the occupation, the mindless chauvinism pervading the country and the widespread complacence or apathy towards sustaining a dangerous political status-quo, the sacrifice no longer made any sense. So I moved back to New Jersey and never looked back....The End"
exmuslim,3dvkbo,utnahpishtim,8,Mon Jul 20 00:52:01 2015 UTC,"Very interesting read. From Sunni Muslim background and I can relate to the astronomical/scientific watershed moment. For myself it was the combined punch from two elective university courses, anthropology and astronomy.   I was extremely ignorant on evolution up to that point, assumed it was just a 'theory'. Yet, when faced with the extensive fossil record and the molecular clock (dna analysis) I had to concede that the Adam and Eve story didn't make much sense. Then came the massive feelings of guilt and cognitive dissonance and I tried to compartmentalize knowledge gained from science vs what the religion was telling me.   I'm not sure if you know much about Islam but it borrows much from Judaism, essentially the same stories (Moses mentioned over 100 times in the Quran) and GOD so it's rather Ironic the two hate each other so much.You can see a similarity between strict Muslims and Jews, that same obsession with the 'law' and militant ""I am right you are wrong and can go die"" outlook."

exmuslim,3dvkbo,utnahpishtim,12,Mon Jul 20 02:47:37 2015 UTC,"I come from a Sunni Hanafi family, Reza Azlan has no authority for a Sunni and would likely be considered a heretic non Muslim. To me he's just a douche bag apologist. We learn from the Quran, authentic 'sahih' hadith and from actual scholars. Classic tasfirs like those of Ibn Khatir are also important.  All of those sources along with Imams trained in Islamic jurisprudence teach a literal interpretation of the deen and are true to how the earliest followers of Islam understood the religion. Adam was the first man, no man before him, Eve created out his rib, was over 60 cubic feet tall etc..  For me what's important is how did the earliest followers of Islam i.e. the sahaba and people right after understood the deen, they took it literally not as some metaphorical story.   If you don't take it literally as Reza Azlan might suggest, then what's stopping you from reinterpreting the numerous creation myths that man has come up with? Perhaps the Hindu creation myth can also be justified? Perhaps heaven/hell, angels, jinn/shayateen is all not meant to be taken literally? I prefer to take the Quran at face value.   It's all very silly, either it's true or it's just a bunch of stories. The Adam Eve story is critical to Islam, it was what started the whole ""journey"", without it the whole narrative makes little sense. It's like the United States without the Declaration of Independence."

Furthermore the most dramatic language of the Declaration ""We hold all these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, and they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, among these life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"", was not at all a part of the Constitution until the Civil War.

When I was a devout Catholic, though, for several years I dated a devout Muslim.  As far as indoctrination goes, a cradle Catholic and a cradle Muslim are pretty much the same thing as far as products of conservative religious families go.  However, Islam being the newer of the two,  Catholics have had a little more time to chill about heretics and apostasy, so there are far fewer of us getting brainwashed or killed these days (self-destruction included).  Although we couldn't have been more different at first glance, my ex and I had a lot in common on the inside.  We were quite the kindred souls until it became apparent that were too much alike, which was why we broke up.  It's nice out here in the country.  Where the 3 counties come together (Warren, Hunterdon, Morris) is the hippest, and has the most people from other parts of the state.  It's nothing like Pennsyltucky.   After we broke up, my ex and I didn't keep in touch.  Some years later, I Googled his name, and was sad to learn that he had died rather young, of a massive heart attack, leaving a wife and their 2 young children behind.  But not before giving up corporate life and the city and buying and settling down on in a little farm in the country.  Which, as it happens, is exactly the same thing that I ended up doing.  Like I said, we very, very much alike.  Which also means, come to think of it, that I should also probably be taking better care of my health..."

exmuslim,3dvkbo,scientus,5,Mon Jul 20 02:47:57 2015 UTC,"All depends really. The Palestinians who simply want a state/end to the occupation and after which will let bygones be bygones and go about building their country in peace, I understand completely. But there are also Palestinians who, at least if you pose the question to them NOW, won't be satisfied with just their own state; who view Israel's existence as an affront to Islam. One would hope that in the wake of a two-state solution, such Palestinians would see that it's not in the interests of their state to sow insurrection. One would hope that as Palestinian economy starts to grow, the zealots would be inhibited from acting; and if they did act, wider Palestinian society--which would benefit from stability--wouldn't support them. Over time, one would also hope that economic development/interdependence with Israel, and increasing interaction with the outside world and the diversity of ideas therein would militate against the vitality of Islamic extremism. This is all theoretical of course.  But to be honest, one of the reasons why I'm so against the occupation is because I want to deny the Palestinians from using it as a pretext for not getting their shit together. Israel, to some degree, is responsible for the Palestinian 'monster'; its given Palestinians very little reason to hope for a better future.. But once Israel fulfills its international obligations and cleans its hands of the Palestinians, the latter's fate is in their own hands; whatever happens, they have only themselves to blame."

exmuslim,3dvkbo,scientus,2,Mon Jul 20 08:17:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Palestinians in the former category had a golden opportunity for a state in the first partition--Israel offered them a lot more land than they have now--and it was rejected.  Which means the Palestinians who control things are all in the latter category.  For example, Hamas uses Christian homes for rocket launchpads--and if you protest them using your home as a launchpad and thus a target for IDF strikes, you will be shot.  If wealth cured it, there wouldn't be jihadists in America."

Rejecting our faith has been the hardest struggle of my entire life, just as with many on this subreddit. The destruction of the core of your identity - to say, I am not a muslim anymore - is a painful and sorrowful thing to do.  But you know, deep within your heart of hearts, that you cannot bear to believe in something that is not true to you. No matter how much serenity it has given you in the past, you just know that you cannot come to accept the unreal. And no matter how much it tugs at your soul, how much you feel that this is just a test of faith from Allah, or how much you feel that my words are the words of Shaitan being whispered into your head - at the end of the day, you have only your own judgement to trust, and none else alone. So, trust your judgement.  And, at the end of the day, consider this - we are raised to love and worship a deity that is a universal patriarch - infinitely wise, compassionate, and understanding. Could such a god truly punish you if you decided that praying salat five times a day was not for you, that fasting is pointless, that beating your wife and polygamy are unethical? That deity purportedly created an entire universe, one that exists far outside the scope that Islam covers. Why should it punish you for being honest to yourself?"

exmuslim,3dw286,scientus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:30:54 2015 UTC,"You are certainly not alone in feeling this way. Everyone who has given up their faith has gone through a period of WANTING to believe. I was never consistent with Islam and prayer was mostly a nuisance to me. However, when I first realized Im succumbing to my doubts, that Islam just might not be true, fear took my life over. I prayed, genuinely prayed, asking Allah for guidance. I didnt want to lose my faith as it was the pilar upon which my entire life was built. I prayed, stopped all my reasearch and just wanted to believe again.   But an intervention never came. It felt as though the rug had been pulled from under me and I had to rebalance my self to stand up again. Hesitantly, I proceeded to enlighten myself, to find out more. The more i looked, the further away I found myself from Islam. I got to a point where I consciously decided to stop identifying as Muslim (to myself, of course. Still closeted).  In retrospect, I've realized that the reason I wanted to believe so bad was for the comfort of knowing; the safety net religion provides. It's so easy to have a formula by which to live your life and reap the benefits later. Its so much more safe to have everything laid out for you as opposed to doing it all yourself. But, oh how sweet it is to be your own moral compass. How liberating it is to decide for yourself what is right and what is wrong, what is suitable for you and what is not, what to do with your own life. Making decisions and realizing that it's all you, not some deity or some peky little devil, is so very empowering. To do good out of genuine goodness of your heart as opposed to racking up brownie points or fear of punisment is the most rewarding feeling there is.   So, friend, believe that you can be everything you've aspired to be with religion, without it. It is ok to doubt yourself, but know that deep down, you have what it takes. Its ok to be afraid, but know that should there actually be a God, it will not hate you for being a good person. You dont need a 1400 year old book to govern your existense. Be as you wish and do good onto others. That is the rule by which I live my life .  Shoudl you need someone, you are welcome to PM me. Best of luck to you. Cyber hug"

I will offer this along with my sympathy for your suffering. Medicine tastes bad, needles sting, and healing sometimes hurts. I stand by the statement that religion is disease. Reason and doubt are the only medicines for it.  If you want a sense of belonging and certainty, go outside at night. Look up at the stars. Try to understand the size and scale of everything. Know that for millennia others just like you have also looked up. They have seen the same stars. They have felt the same feelings. They have wondered about the same uncertainties. All over the world each day and night, they still do. You are a voice in that choir, and a member of all of humanity--those that have lived, those that live now, and those children yet to be born into this world. The universe is incomparably larger than the short and tiny life a single person lives. Each life will learn, and grow, and experience joys, and will suffer. If you can lend comfort to any other person--if you can enrich another's life or lessen their burden, then you can partake in and contribute to humanity, and that is a beautiful thing. You can do this not for reward, not for fear of punishment, not for tradition, not for law, but out of love for what we all share. Just love. Just be.  I hope my perspective helps you, brother (or sister)."

exmuslim,3dul52,seafair,-2,Mon Jul 20 17:12:36 2015 UTC,"Umm...100% wrong, at least in my case. I'm a convert and most that I know (and knew) were nothing like you describe. We were simply looking for a ""better"" religion than the one we grew up with and ""found"" Islam.   I read the Quran and it really spoke to me at the time and ended up becoming Muslim years later. The problem with converts I think is three-fold: 1) many are full of zeal and jump in 100% because they are excited that their new faith has answers--Christians are famous for not having answers for questioning believers and just being told to believe.  This is very inspiring. 2) Having come from a faith-tradition and seeking another for life's snswers, many lack a real scientific/critical method of discerning truth from falsehood other than it sounds or feels right.  3) They are told it is better-- more thawab--to read the Quran in Arabic, and hence stop reading it in a language they understand.  This means that their real interface with the core texts comes from someone else whom they have been told they can trust.   Couple this with the fact that many LOSE their friends and families because of their decision to embrace Islam and you have more zeal and more reliance in the Muslim community and their stances.  A least this is my take. There's a lot more to it other than they're just a bunch of losers. In fact, I was pretty taken back by that comment."

exmuslim,3dul52,vestayekta,3,Mon Jul 20 09:44:33 2015 UTC,"I didn't even notice much of that when I first became Muslim   In my experience, converts are encouraged to become Muslim without doing the proper research first. Like, you can just express an interest in Islam and Dawahganda type people will be all over you telling one side of the story and hoping you convert asap.   That peer pressure and the excitement and acceptance they show can be infectious, and make someone want to covert to be a part of that.   In contrast, when someone wants to leave Islam they have to be an expert Islamic scholar who knows everything about every little Hadith otherwise they're just crazy, selfish murtad.   On this sub we discuss the insecurity of Muslims a lot because we see it daily from an outsider perspective. This dichotomy between entering and leaving Islam is just another reflection of that I think.

I don't think you need to be an Arab or a Muslim to think critically and see that what's happening there is not okay. Also, before you start spouting off racist garbage, maybe, MAYBE just try to entertain an intellectual thought process with articles that back up what you're saying. For instance, here's an article where Palestinian people are denied fair access to water. Fucking water! https://www.amnestyusa.org/pdf/mde150272009en.pdf  Here's an article about how dozens of children were left homeless after Israel illegally demolished their homes: http://www.rt.com/news/225947-israel-demolish-palestinian-homes/ And lastly, for something slightly different but just as fucked up as your baseless comments, an article where Israeli gynecologists systematically gave Ethiopian jews birth control shots. http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/israel-admits-ethiopian-women-were-given-birth-control-shots.premium-1.496519"
exmuslim,3dul52,fenny12,0,Sun Jul 19 22:03:52 2015 UTC,"Did I mention that Israel doesn't do anything? Muslims and Jews are the sides of the same coin, they're both pieces of shit. They both do the same prayers, and both want to fuck children.   But like I said Palestinians are fucking jerks. Why do you think Jordan doesn't like them (Jordanians are basically Palestinians with a country) why don't Jordan make Palestine part of them? Because they're fucking jerks.   If you want to sympathise with Palestine go fund Hamas or something, you know the ""oppressed"" terrorist group that kills non Muslims and stone women. The group that was shown above that is the real ""systematic oppression "" on Palestine. Palestine loves them because they are jerks.   Do you sympathise with Muslims who agree with ISIS too? You're fucked up and need to stop wearing that Che Guevara shirt."
exmuslim,3dul52,Rutherglen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:45:48 2015 UTC,"I stated why I think your initial statements were racist and not backed up by any real argument. I also didn't say Israel doesn't do anything. Yes, history and religion are intertwined but nowhere did I talk about religion. I can sympathize with what's happening in Palestine because there is a shit ton of history and obviously complex factors that make what's happening there really sad. I also understand what's happening in Israel is not okay either. For me to state these things, doesn't make me a supporter of Hamas, ISIS or the IDF (to be clear, I don't sympathize with at all). That is the beauty of critical thinking. It also helps me to not be a total fuckwit so that when faced with contrary views, I have more to say than, you're a jerk. boo hoo hoo. And also, if you want to talk about marxism in what's happening politically within Palestine, Israel, Jordan, then go ahead because that would actually be interesting.

He was looking for apologetics so that he can reconcile the issue in his mind and continue being devout. I looked it up, gave him the standard answer, but this did not satisfy me. It just seemed like a shitty thing for a god and a religion to allow. So I buried it, but it never went away.   The other thing that bothered me was the child bride (Aisha, fucked at age 9). Khalid abu  el fadl had a great discussion about this, he thought it was a mistranslation or something. Abu al fadl had some other liberal ideas that I liked, and these actually kept me around for another year or two. But it wasn't enough. You gotta call a spade a spade, and you gotta call bullshit bullshit.   So I doubted for about 7-9 years before I dropped the bullshit. The change was gradual. I was too busy to go for prayers and rituals and I didn't like them, so those went. I was a sort of deist for a few years. This approach made me an ""apatheist"", you know apathetic toward theism.

And this harassment is not limited to females and not a new phenomenon either. When I was a young lad growing up in Jeddah, on several occasions local men approached me and tried to grab me. Once a sicko came up behind me and pressed himself on me when I was getting ice cream out of the freezer at a corner store! Another shite-for-brains even cornered me in an apartment building but I managed to squirrel away after a sharp side thrust to his abdomen (flight response kicked in literally). Then there were times when these creeps would flash their genitalia (in all their states) to the neighbourhood kids playing out in the afternoon whilst most adults were taking their afternoon siestas. No Muttawas (religious police) to be seen anywhere (probably all busy chastising women at the local malls for showing a bit too much hand). During one paricularly scary incident, I recall walking at dusk near a massive under-construction roundabout with a ship structure as its centerpiece near Jeddah's corniche, and this guy in a ""thobe"" (Saudi dress) drove up in a beat up Chevrolet Caprice with one foot sticking out the window. Saudis can be pretty reckless drivers, but before I digress, he blocked my path and slithered out of his car towards me speaking in Arabic. I didn't understand but soon he whipped out 50 Riyals (Saudi currency) and tried to hand it to me whilst simultaneously motioning towards my behind. Shocked, I tried hightailing it but the thobed assman started following me in his car until I managed to get to a populated street. It was a frightening experience; perhaps a punishment from Allah for missing Maghrib prayers. So the behavior in the video though detestable, is symptomatic of a deeper malaise that seems to be pervasive and enduring."

When you asked them for the reason of their personal animosity towards jews the answer is either religion or Israeli/Palestinian conflicts.  I was riding a taxi once, and the driver was admonishing local corrupt officials then ended his rant with ""they're just like jews stealing everything."" So I asked him if he ever met a jew before. He said no. I asked him if he knew what a jew looked like enough to tell that a person is a jew or not. He said no. Then I asked how he got the idea that jews like to steal everything. He said that was what he had heard from many people (i'm assuming like clerics in mosques and other muslims).   Then I asked the driver how many jews are in our government and how many muslims. Indonesia is run by a majority sunni muslims with absolutely zero jewish presence. How about the corrupt Indonesian police, how many jews are there? And the military which is the most corrupt entity in Indonesia, how many jewish generals? I asked him again so who's responsible for the terribly fucked-up situation in Indonesia, the jews or the muslims. The taxi driver just stayed quiet.  Whenever I hear Indonesian muslims used the Israeli/Palestinian conflict to fuel their vitriol against jews, I'd asked if the conflict will have any impact to Indonesia's economy. Will the prices for rice and vegetable increase/decrease? Will it affect Indonesia's employment rate? How about the debilitating poverty situation in Indonesia? Pollution?

This particular Quranic passage's description of an obscure biblical tale was so verse for verse that it stuck out to me. It fell in like a puzzle piece as part of the larger image I was discovering at the time: Mo was heavily influenced by contemporary Levantine religious discourse. Decades of doing caravans to Syria for trade, his close relationship with his Christian monk cousin-in-law, etc."

If you use Erdogan to gage Turkey, then it may appear that way, but we have had Erdogans before and we will have them again. Even then his party has been losing quite a bit of support. Statistically there are more and more atheists, and they are becoming more and more open about it (evident by ex-muslim programs opening up). My town of around 100,000 recently rebuilt an old Greek church, and it has had like 3 new bars open up in the year that I wasn't there. While a bit anecdotal, it does seem the country is moving in the right track. I think one problem is that people's earlier perception of Turkey was a bit skewed, and assumed that Istanbul=Turkey. While it is was and still is a big part of Turkish society, in recent years we saw the conservative parts of Turkey (which were always there) become more and more empowered. This makes it seem like Turkey has become more conservative, when really its just the conservative part of Turkey has gained more coverage."

There were three coups, two because of Islamic tendencies of the rulers and one because of a close civil war environment in 1980 which led to the military stage a coup against the government.

exmuslim,3dud95,talltaleteller,2,Sun Jul 19 17:03:34 2015 UTC,"Listen, I'd just like to make a point. FemaleInfidel's comments about Turkish 'crypto Islam' and there being 30 million crypto Muslims in Turkey is obviously retarded as you correctly indicated; we both agree there.   However, the article about Turks being acculturated Armenians is not something to dismiss out of hand. The ethnic composition of the Turkish people today is very, very different from that of other Turkic peoples, even other Oghuz peoples like the Turkmens. The majority of the population of Asia Minor before Turkish arrival in the battle of Manzikert (1073) was extremely high, and the number of ethnic Turks in the Seljuq armies that settled there afterwards was quite low. In addition, many were also pastoralists, not city dwellers.  The Greeks and Armenians, the majority population of Anatolia that were conquered by the Turks were slowly converted to Islam under state pressure (I mean, you're an ex-Muslim so you know how horrific pressure to convert to Islam has historically been in various sultanates). But they were not all killed. They mixed with the Turks who had become the ruling class in the new Turkish states and contributed their dna to the new Turkish nation. So Turkish people today really look almost exactly the same as Greeks or Armenians do - at least to my eyes, and I have quite a lot of Turkish friends.   Genetically also, they are close, as the study you criticized showed.  The point I'm trying to make is, unless you're a racist or Turkish-supremacist there is nothing wrong with your nation being mixed with Greeks and Armenians, I don't see why you have to fight it."
exmuslim,3dud95,19O5,2,Sun Jul 19 17:15:03 2015 UTC,"Dude, I didn't fight it. Anatolian Turks are obviously mixed, I'm not denying that. But saying that Turks are mostly actual Christians etc. and her bullshit claims made me try to correct her.  My point is that Anatolian Turks are Anatolian Turks and that means having different genetics compared to Central Asian Turks. We obviously mixed with the peoples of Anatolia.

I'm just very sensitive to ethnic purism and racism from Turks because among the Turkish people I know, a couple have spoken about their neighbors (Greeks, Armenians, Kurds, Arabs) in a way that I can only describe as vile.

Greeks   I'm from the Aegean myself, and I love Greeks, seriously.  We might have had issues in the past. And have the issue of Cyprus, but Greeks are so similar to us, hating them would be ridiculous.   Armenians   The dislike for Armenians is not due to them being Armenians but due to their diaspora, and them occupying Karabağ. They occupy Azerbaijani territory for more than 20 years. And that's why our border to them is not opened. They'll always accuse Turks and they'll think they're the victims, but they displaced 700k Azerbaijanis and killed thousands of them and occupy their territory. There's a real reason to dislike Armenia.   Kurds   It's the PKK which we Turks hate, not Kurds. There are 15M Kurds in our country, and we have mixed families. But separatism is growing stronger among them.   Arabs   Arabs, we don't dislike Arabs per se.  But there's a growing dislike for Syrians because there are more than 2M Syrian refugees in Turkey and they cause unrests.

exmuslim,3dsq5i,wazzym,2,Sun Jul 19 05:35:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's what's being argued, it's that fgm is more common amongst shafi muslim region(somalia, yemen, indonesia, malaysia, eritrea and kurdistan) because he preached that female circumsion is a obligatory, not to mention that the other madhabs are in favour to it to some degree. So it's less an Islam problem and more linked to muslim cultures. This isn't to say that they are the only ones who practice it, many african christians also practice it too, but when people tell to stop it's easier to change the status-quo because there's no clergy to argue with. This is why even in africa it's muslim regions that have higher rates of fgm. This also doesn't mean that muslims are inherently more sceceptible to want to practice fgm only that it's hrder to convise them to stop.  To sum it, know one is really blamming Muhammad, the quran or Islam, but it is false to assert that it's ""just an african problem""."

It was not until having my third niece did i finally realize that FGM actually occurs in this country and when i asked my friends, the more modern ones (religious or not) don't actually do this stuff but the traditional ones (again, religious or not) still does.   I think it is one of those things that are being encouraged and further pushed as a religious tradition despite it being known as a cultural Malay thing and believe me, our culture has a lot of influence from Buddhist and Hindu culture and they are even being labeled as 'Islamic' for a select few as a justification for its preservation through the generations."

It wasn't even Muhammad (saw) who directly ordered the killing of the men and enslaving of the women and children, it was the leader of Banu Aws, who were sympathetic to the Qurayza at the time.  Yes, the situation is sad in and of itself, and perhaps we all have differing opinions of whether it was warranted, but it was not the massacre that people make it out to be, so I don't feel I'm ""spinning it"".

exmuslim,3dsq5i,RewindtheParadox,3,Mon Jul 20 00:05:39 2015 UTC,"You're taking the apologetic argument's at face value.    anu Qurayza were subject to such harsh punishment because of their treachery   The decision to attack them came from Gabriel. Muhammad made it up, he had other motives to attack the tribe clearly. Wikiislam posits that it's because his army won no plunder as the Meccan's just retreated without a fight, that's entirely plausible and in keeping with the actions of a warlord.   Second, you're basically saying it's OK to practice collective punishment. Do you think every single person in the tribe was guilty of the treachery, or just a few as is usually the case? Do you think it's OK when Israel bombs Palestinians for the actions of Hamas? Why did innocent children have to be carted off into slavery by Muhammad because of the actions of their leaders?    I don't think it's fair to say just because someone didn't fight, they should be exempt from such treatment   You are saying in plain terms that you basically accept collective punishment as a legit tactic to be practiced during conflict.    Given the chance it would have been more probable than not that they would have attacked the Muslims.   Their opportunity for attack was during the siege, and they didn't take it. That shows at the very least that there was indecision over it and maybe not everyone agreed.    It wasn't even Muhammad (saw) who directly ordered the killing    He approved of the sentence. He also carried off the others into slavery.    it was the leader of Banu Aws, who were sympathetic to the Qurayza at the time.   A careful analysis of the sahih hadiths on this account reveals Saad bin Muadh was just echoing Muhammad’s intention as his verdict. Soon after Saad bin Muad gave his verdict, Muhammad rushed to applaud him stating Saad's judged was in accordance with the judgement of Allah. Again from Sahih Bukhari:   Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: The people of (Banu) quraiza agreed to accept the verdict of Sad bin Muadh. So the Prophet sent for Saad, and the latter came (riding) a donkey and when he approached the Mosque, the Prophet said to the Ansar, ""Get up for your chief or for the best among you."" Then the Prophet said (to Sad)."" These have agreed to accept your verdict."" Sad said, ""Kill their (men) warriors and take their offspring as captives, ""On that the Prophet said, ""You have judged according to Allah's Judgment,"" or said, ""according to the King's judgment."" Sahih Bukhari 5:59:447   http://wikiislam.net/wiki/The_Genocide_of_Banu_Qurayza  The problem isn't that Muhammad here is doing typical warlord things, it's the fact that he's doing this shit and still called the uswa hasana by the majority of Muslims. It's extremely easy to twist this event into doing things like what ISIS does (and they cite this Hadith often).    but it was not the massacre that people make it out to be,   What do people make it out to be? It's a massacre, innocent people were beheaded en masse. veryone with pubic hair, no less, so likely as young as 13 or 14.  All on the ""orders"" of Muhammad's imaginary friend, Gabriel. It is a massacre through and through, these people never attacked Muhammad.   It was an American style pre-emptive strike at best.   In addition, the treatement of POW's by Muslims during the time was much different to pre-Islamic tradition.   This is whataboutism.   Well about the pre-Islamic pagans?  Well what about the Christians?  etc...  This is not about them, this is about Muhammad and Islam."

If you assume the core of the Islamic faith is wrong (the revelation of the Qur'an) then to you everything else is man made and Muhammad (saw) does everything according to his own desires.  Hence no discussion is necessary.  We are both obviously set on our views, but for sake of responding to your claims, I'll say this:    The hadith you cited doesn't prove that discussions would not have went on had Saad suggested otherwise.  All that is confirmed in this hadith is that Allah (swt) deemed this would happen, and that it is divine justice.  Just by the sentence ""Muhammad rushed to applaud him"" shows the bias WikiIslam has.  Saad was practically on his death bed and had no reason to state anything other than what he thought the truth was.  Approving the sentence is not the same thing as suggesting it openly, where it will influence what others think, especially since he was a prophet.  There is no concrete way of knowing who was thinking what at the time, it's all speculation, but it is most probable that the men of the tribe would have enacted upon their treachery.  Everyone also had the option of converting and those that did take it were spared.  I am not saying anything on collective punishment, it is entirely dependent on the situation, and the act shouldn't be judged in some absolute sense.  In some cases it's acceptable, in some not.  You might have a different opinion and feel situations like this never should happen.  That is your right.  In addition, you cannot discount the treatment of slaves prior to Islam.  You have to have something to compare and contrast to."

Yes, true. Until you can demonstrate there's anything divine about the Quran or that Muhammad was speaking to an angel, there's no reason to assume any of it is true. It's just stories no different from any other religion.    The hadith you cited doesn't prove that discussions would not have went on    I know, I was speculating. Assuming the Hadith is true, of course.    Approving the sentence is not the same thing as suggesting it openly,   Why not? Muhammad said it was Allah's will.

We already know one, The Banu Qurayza massacre...though you can clarify if you don't support it. Did the women and children deserve to be taken into slavery? Did the men who had nothing to do with the leader's treachery deserve to be beheaded?  is it Allah's will?   In addition, you cannot discount the treatment of slaves prior to Islam.   Why? Slavery is slavery.   Besides, the institution of slavery wasn't as bad everywhere as it was in pre-Islamic Arabia (or so we assume, there's no records besides the Muslim's word and they had an incentive to make pagans look bad).

I don't think your writing was called ""shit talk"" because it didn't agree with someone's atheistic world view. I think it was called ""shit talk"" because of your relentless apologetics.    You were previously surprised that someone attributed alleged words of Gabriel to Muhammad (how dare they), yet you diffuse sense of rationality in discussing morality of canonical histories. In other words, what is just religious lore, exempt from normal historical rigor, should be taken as ""truth"", but our criticism and rationalism should be taken with suspicion because of ""our very finite natures"".   I know you don't see any problem in this, it's sort of state of nature to you. But to anyone who is outside of religious conditioning, your attitude is DEEPLY paradoxical, and an antithesis of critical thinking. I guess someone summarized it as ""shit talk"". People are just tired of facing the same irrational bias over and over again.   And before you think ""it's them who are biased"" try to ask yourself this:  1) Why should there be an assumption that an angel spoke to human. If someone said so today, would you give them 50-50 guess that it's true?  2) Whenever people criticize moral decisions of literary character called ""God"", either in biblical or quranic narrative, they hear ""we are too finite, too limited to understand it"".

Islam, Christianity, and Judaism didn't have a single verse that prohibited kissing your cousin (I thought it'd be funny to put it this way), and it was/is pretty common for people of those faiths to practice it. Today, first-cousin marriages are very prominent within the Middle East and South/South-East Asia. In Western societies, we view the practice as incestuous, hazardous, and just plain gross. We hear about how birth defects, genetic disorders, and other diseases can happen almost TWICE as likely a result of the relationship; but not many people actually take a look at the numbers. According to the Journal of Genetic Counseling, the risk of birth defects/diseases in children that are born to first cousins increases from 3-4 percent (from parents that are non-related) to 4-7 percent. When it comes to the numbers, many genetics researchers have pretty much concluded that they just don't back the taboo that we've created for first-cousin relationships. It's honestly more so an issue of social acceptance that it is about genetics. You can have children with someone who's in your own ethnic group (and be non-related), and still have a high chance of passing a certain disease to your offspring because of hereditary diseases that exist within certain ethnic groups. Of course, there are definitely some families that have certain genes they don't want to pass, so genetic screening is recommended; although, it's recommended for pretty much everyone since who never know who can be carrying what.   It's definitely more of a taboo topic than it is about genetics. There are some factors that can also increase your chance at giving your child a genetic disease, like having children at an older age. Having a child over the age of 35 could actually raise the risks to 4-9 percent, but you don't see older couples get criticized for it (at least from what I know). Tackling the taboo part of it, I know many different families from Palestine, and many of those families had members that did marry their cousin (first, second, third, etc). Everyone one of those family members had pretty conservative parents and views, which often included not mixing with family members of the opposite gender unless they were siblings, aunts, or grandparents. So when they married their cousin, it really didn't affect them because they didn't grow up with them, live with them, or even interact with them in most cases.  I think that's where the ""ewww"" part stems from because we probably did grow up with our first-cousins and can't imagine getting intimate with them. I have a few family members that did marry cousins, and this was typically the response from them. To sum it up, I'm no in so way shape or form advocating that everyone marry their first-cousins, lol. I'm simply trying to shed some light on the somewhat controversial issue.   Edit: I've seen some article posts about the Pakistani population in Bradford and how first-cousin marriages are causing problems. My argument does back that; their genetic issues are primarily hereditary that exists amongst the ethnic population as a whole. A common genetic disorder that's impacting the population is histiocytosis. Like I said, some ethnicities and lineages carry some disorders that can most certainly be found if they get screened. Both parents being carriers of a disease can really do some damage in the long term."

Not all of them will be carriers, and a majority of them probably won't pass down the disease to their offsprings. For the few that do, this is why there's screening, which I'm adamant about for everyone.

exmuslim,3dt3tv,throwaway0221,2,Sun Jul 19 13:45:53 2015 UTC,"Commenting from my porn alt to give my 2 cents.  I am unfortunately a product of two cousins marrying each other. My mother and father are first cousins and knew each other since childhood. My father calls my maternal grandmother ""phuppujaan"" and my mother calls my paternal grandmother ""maamijaan"".  The actual culture behind two cousins marrying each other in Islamic India is pretty mundane according to my family. It was never seen as taboo and even encouraged since the family knew the temperament of the bride and groom well. That way they could have ""compatible"" marriages with out any major fights and arguments within the two families (this solves many problems due to the extended nature of families in India).  I've actually confronted my parents about this and they told it off as something completely normal much like the culture. However the most disturbing part about it was the fact that they were pretty much childhood sweethearts, irregardless of being cousins.  I have no genetic defects that I am aware of. I came from a pretty healthy family. I do have a white pigmentation on my right leg that looks like a sick burn scar.   To put the commonness of cousin marriage into perspective, my Phuppu and Phuppa (paternal aunt and maternal uncle) are also cousins, and one of my cousins is engaged to another.

People's belief in God, in and of itself, is not something I'm even interested in discrediting, except perhaps the details of their belief and their consistency. People's belief in God is another topic altogether, relating to psychology or sociology etc. Although Bacon connected his claim that God is revealed in the universe with an assertion on the nature of the atheists' psychology, we're nonetheless still dealing with Bacon's original claim and his own stated reasons for holding those beliefs.   We can only work with what we're given and the context we have for Bacon's assertion makes his whole statement fallacious. It is not my opinion that his statement is fallacious, it's a fact. I never said that his claim about the nature of God or the universe would by itself be fallacious; it wouldn't be, but it wasn't given by itself. It was given as a premise in a series of sentences within a paragraph, that are obviously supposed to be considered as connected, leading to the conclusion—that depth in philosophy brings people to religion. It's a premise he had a chance to defend, but only did with an appeal to emotion: that he'd rather believe in Jewish or Muslim fables, than hold an atheistic worldview (putting aside the straw man atheist he's using in his arguments). Saying that atheists don't have philosophical depth, because they're not convinced by the nature of the universe to believe in a God, because of Bacon's emotional preferences even for ""all the fables"" over an atheistic worldview, is fallacious as an argument. Since he wrote it down, you and others quote his statement and since he is being used as an authority to make a point (often even as part of an appeal to authority fallacy), I'm refuting him.  I never said that his state as a non-atheist discredits his scientific achievements.   Regarding Craig and Plantinga, for these two you have thousands who'd be willing, and indeed are, arguing against their assertions successfully. Just because a theist with a doctorate in philosophy exists and engages in religious apologetics (for Christianity, by the way), doesn't mean his claims hold weight. That is the fallacious appeal to authority I was talking about before. But back to Bacon's original statement, that depth in philosophy brings one's mind to religion... some actual statistics say otherwise, that it's in fact atheism that dominates. And I'm pretty sure nobody goes as deep into philosophy as actual philosophers. Bacon was alive 400 years ago. If you want to criticize Sarah Haider's philosophical outlook by Bacon's fallacious standard, maybe it's you that needs to be criticized a bit."

However if I ever have an SO I don't have any specifics about the beliefs of my partner as long as they don't get in the way of our life.

He got a lesser sentence (which I don't agree with) because, like all foreigners when in trouble, said he didn't know this was against the law I. Australia. Yeah right! He showed he didn't know by stupidly going to Centrelink to register his wife for welfare payments and also tried to enrol her In a school saying he was now her husband and guardian. I believe he was told by at least one person it was against the law, but Australia, being the fucked up liberal lefty PC country it is, erred on his side. The girls father is a convert so of course he knew it was against the law, and he was supposed to protect his daughter, hence the higher sentence for the father.

It's all about dominance, increasing it's numbers(why do you think polygamy, and first cousin marriages are allowed?) to achieve status in the world. Until you understand this factor, then you will come to a conclusion to answer your Question.  Just to correct you, born Muslims can also be killed for treason if they leave Islam. Islamic Law doesn't really differ in how you became a Muslim. You leave it, and you get the chop chop."
exmuslim,3drwaw,EgoSaber,3,Sun Jul 19 03:43:10 2015 UTC,"This is the sort of bullshit too many Muslims swallow with unbelievable ease. If you don't believe in our entity anymore you've committed an act of treason and you're prone to capital punishment. This is to say that you can be punished for things that are completely out of your control. Like whether you sincerely believe in God. You can't choose to believe in something.  This is what Orwell meant with thought-crime. What occurs in your mind, when presented to challenging facts are not under the realm of your control. So, to punish you for how you process new knowledge is to punish you for ""crimes"" you are not responsible for.  So for a Muslim society to apply this law of apostasy equals treason, one would've needed a round a clock supervising telescreen, not unlike those described in 1984. By then the Islamic vicar of Allah would supervise your every facial expression, every twitch of the eye and every turn of the lip. Maybe then would the sincerity of your belief be provable?"
exmuslim,3drwaw,flashA1,2,Sat Jul 18 21:55:08 2015 UTC,I can understand why Muslims (or anyone else) would want to kill those who give an oath and then turn back on it…    Maybe you would be better off asking this on the ISIS sub...  Muhammad said himself according to the hadiths that those who leave the religion need to be killed and the Koran says that emulating Muhammad is doing the will of Allah. So killing apostates is okay in Islam.

exmuslim,3drwaw,exapologetica,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:04:58 2015 UTC,From my understanding it's not leaving the religion which gets you death as a punishment.

I've asked two men in the past, who are ruqaah and they both took advantage of my situation and wanted to do haram with me.Therefore, I ask you kindly to help clarify this issue for me and ask that you forgive me for any vulgarity in sharing the issue. I have been married for 18 years but in the past 10 years, I have been very bothered by my husband. Over the years, my husband has been interested in trying different things in bed. What has bothered me the most is that he wants to be a female in bed and prefers the role of the female over the male. He wants me to address him as if he is a female. He wants to wear female clothes and he gets more desire when he takes on this role. At first, I thought it was a phase but then I found that he has trouble getting excited if he takes the male role. He asks me to do things that I can not bear - He wants to be penetrated like a female, with a tool or with my finger. I told him that I don't think this is halal. I told him that I don't want him to be a female in bed. However, he is struggling with this. He enjoys this role more than anything else. Am I overreacting? Is this something normal for a man? Is something wrong with him? How do I deal with this situation? What does Islam say about a man taking on the role of a woman in bed? My husband is a pious man. He prays his prayers and I do too. I just can't understand this problem and feel like it is too much for me to bear. I have 4 children. I feel committed to them. I just can't bear what happens in bed. Please, please shed some Islamic light on this issue. Please contact me via e-mail if you need any further detail to give me a good fatwa. Thanks...."

exmuslim,3dqemh,tea_sniffer,3,Sat Jul 18 13:05:37 2015 UTC,"I read to the end of The Cow yesterday and the first thing that jumped in my mind was that there is an awful lot of insecurity and affirmations in the quran. Every other passage there is a paragraph about all this being true and that you must use Allah as a shield and that everything is true over and over without ever providing any explanation for the validity of the passages.  It screams insecurity. You can not constantly just say something is true to make it true unless you expect that by repeating over and over the reading of passages telling you the revelations are true that you will believe they are.  I think I am going to start to mark passages by removing the parts that only praise or comment that the content is true as they make about 30% of the text...its rather unsettling when you read it. I also need to read it in two other languages to see how it is translated but (now I am at The Women) makes me feel like a lot is disorganized. It starts with praises then for no reasons jumps to divorce for a long time then jumps to other things like menstruation...its weird and feels pieced together badly  One other things that jumped right out was the fact that apparently a lot of it is just taken from the Bible and the Torah. I wonder how Mohammed thought that using names like Gabriel, Mary, Jesus, Adam etc and repeating the myths of Moses would not immediately point the finger at plagiarism."
exmuslim,3dqemh,Neverdied,3,Sat Jul 18 18:18:25 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I was thinking. The text was weird and fragmented and the topics jumped around randomly. I was wondering if it was the translation and how it would make more sense in other language translations closer to Arabic.   And I constantly felt like I needed more context because I think the Quran assumed we would know what went on in the Bible and the torah? So to understand the Quran are the first two books required reading? Especially the whole cow portion. The only reason I could keep track of that was because I already knew the Moses story. Sometimes it felt like the Quran spent a lot of time dissing Jews.   Also i think the Quran isn't in chronological order? I'm not sure.   And a large portion of that surah was it going on and on again about how God is true and non believers are horrible and do horrible things. It felt like I was reading a lot of useless filler. I get it. You're all powerful and super real and non believers are too blind to see your signs. Okay. Thanks. Apparently this surah is the longest one in the Quran? And it also kept saying over and over again that God is true and real without ever really providing any explanation other than you have to take their word for it.   And I found it interesting how it kept saying believes should beware of hypocrites. Yet, it'll go on about how God is merciful and forgiving, and then right in the next passage, talk about how non believers deserve to burn in eternal damnation.   Also how non believers deserve to be killed. Although for that I think deserves context. I think at that time there was a lot of holy war, and I think it was specifically talking about fighting in a war. And about the enemy /oppressors. So in a war context and self defense, killing makes sense. Because it has another portion where it says you shouldn't kill. Or at least only repay terrible deeds with the equivalent. Like murder. Unless you forgive them, then no one is allowed to murder as equal vengeance anymore. And I think that was for the more every day regular stuff. This was the portion that made me want to know more about the history of that area. Because I think mentions of the war deserves historical context for it to be understood.   And how non believers will have their hearts closed off by God so they will never ever find the light and faith again. How counter productive is that? Like thanks? I don't believe in God so you let me continue not believing in you? OK. Good job. What happened to forgiveness?   But there were portions with more moderate stuff in there. And that part I found interesting too. Because those were the parts that moderate Muslims cherry pick off. And some of the whole no drinking thing or treating each other nicely and all that sounds reasonable enough. And even though it was male centric, it did try to say something along the lines of husbands and wives have their own responsibilities and stuff like that. Even the divorce thing didn't sound too terrible. And also the stuff about the wills and all that. It sounded reasonable-ish enough. It sounded like it was trying to keep the peace between people. Although it said we should fast at Ramadan, it never really mentioned why.   The reason why I think those portions about the daily life, marriage and halal stuff sound reasonable is because I expected much worse. The people around me in real life are sometimes so incredibly strict and judgemental about it and live by very strict complicated rules that are supposed to be muslim rules. But the Quran made it look pretty simple compared to what those people were doing. But again it's simple in relation to those people, not that it's actually universally simple at all. I basically had very low expectations of the Quran.   Although I've not gone beyond the cow yet. So maybe things get more and more convoluted as it goes on. I wouldn't know.   But it did annoy me that the book was written in a way where it assumed a man would be reading it. Every mention of a woman was in the context of the woman being in relation to the (male) believer reading the text. That's what it felt like anyway."

I was a believing Muslim until I started reading the English translation from the beginning. I got to half the Quran and stopped. I still want to finish it but more so to reinforce my belief that it is s fairy tale. It is not easy to let go of habits indoctrinated over 5 decades and the journey is difficult but reading the text is what stayed me on it.

What Caliphate he's talking about? Hizb ut-Tahrir or MB one? Nope, they are mere talkers, and the dude talks stuff about conquering the world through brute force. He means Salafi Jihadists. No idea what group he means (might as well be ISIS or less likely AQ, but seeing as how AQ is irrelevant now, and ISIS has 100K troops, bayats all across the Islamic world due to successes, incredibly resilient against 3 regular Arab armies, other Sunni rebel fractions and 2 Kurdish fractions), i can think of no one else except for ISIS who is known for such ambitions."

This is an inadequate attempt to answer the bigger question behind the question you mentioned: the argument from evil.   Which is, how do we reconcile the existence of evil in the world with the claim of an omniscient, omnipotent and absolutely 'good' God?  Epicurus put this rather elegantly back in ~300 BC:   Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent.  Is he able, but not willing?  Then he is malevolent.  Is he both able and willing?  Then whence cometh evil?  Is he neither able nor willing?  Then why call him God?"

exmuslim,3dr9fp,CadmeusCain,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:00:42 2015 UTC,Worse still are the verses claiming that sheitan is spending all of his time trying to deceive people by twisting Islam and lead them down the wrong path. You could easily use this to argue that the Quran itself was authored by sheitan (since the book itself is so inconsistent and confusing) and that the true word of God has been obfuscated and hidden from man. And go further to say even that Muslims are not worshipping Allah but sheitan.
exmuslim,3dr9fp,shilling_for_the_fed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:33:51 2015 UTC,"It's not an argument, that's an assertion that Allah knows best and things just are.  This isn't arguing (with evidence) that the quran is clear and precise, but that the reader is not clear in his or her motives.  It's saying there are no misunderstandings or disagreements over text, merely the workings of people's inner desires. So you're not confused as to the meaning of a verse or the intention behind a command, but rather you're unwilling to accept what you are told and want to believe something different.  You could use that approach, if you're a literalist, since most of the quran is pig shit level reasoning, but I doubt the Muslims conceited enough to think they can ""argue"" in defence of nonsense, want to see themselves as pig shit people. They want to believe in a more refined and subtle quran."

His reasons for becoming a fundi are all fucked up psychology and daddy issues, but he is the real deal on that side. A former recruiter for Al Mouhajiroun.  I don't believe he'd kill me, I think I know that for certain, but I do believe that his associates would and that he'd be conflicted over the matter (meaning that he would be a legitimate threat to my life).  Some of my ""Cultural Muslim"" friends would jump on-board, if the Muslims become more powerful. They're pretty simple people, but I've known them since childhood and I just observe how society affects them and how propaganda manipulates them.  I think the chop-chop types won't necessarily be the ones that believe most sincerely, but the ones that identify with the group most passionately. Just like the IS fighters and terrorists.  Of course, it should be obvious from the above, that I either live in London or Syria.  London's full of fundies. I fear it will turn into the purge sometime in the next few years. The Muslims are subnormal intellects, generally, they have no conception of how profoundly weak and vulnerable they are. They cling to fantasies about English people and the belief that their victory is inevitable and ordained by god.  A couple of trident strikes would wipe Islam and hundreds of Muslims from the map. And just like in Gujrat, people will feel nothing about committing Muslim-style mass murder upon Muslims, if they're pushed far enough.

I don't know any personally,  though I see a few keyboard jihadis online who are supportive of sharia and want to run the Christians out of the country or convert them.  However,  it's Eid,  and because different religious groups determine what day Eid falls on,  there are multiple Eid days (today is the biggest Eid day).  This means that the keyboard jihadis are busy insulting each other and calling each other kafir over what day Eid is supposed to be  instead of focusing on non-Muslims.   But the average Senegalese is very accepting of different beliefs."

The first time that I visited him in America (I live in UAE), he was an ordinary semi-religious guy. He didn't pray properly (too fast) All he did was work, basketball, sleep.  I visit 3 years later and he was super-religious. Didn't seem like he cared too much about 'political' islamic issues. He used to tell me not to care about debates with non-Muslims and dumb arguments about moon-sighting. It seemed to be more about praying Taraweeh, donating to Masjids and stuff.  2/3 years later he's gone and joined Shabaab. It was unexpected for me. I found out from my mom not long ago that before he left, people at the masjid were saying that if anyone was going to become extremist it would be him. He must have changed even more since I left.  Here in the UAE where I am there are plenty of religious people but I never see crazies who want to go and 'fight'. There are also lots of other differences between here and religious communities in America."

There is nothing to ""believe"" about it just like there is nothing to believe about what happens to water when you freeze it...you only need to understand not believe. With Religion you can not understand because you can not test or explain so you can only believe."
exmuslim,3dq8mw,Neverdied,3,Sat Jul 18 16:35:04 2015 UTC,"If you know and understand biology you know what death is about...the end of electrical nerve impulses in your brain. Two things are constant since the beginning of humanity: 1) people don t want to die 2) people want something to happen after they will die because they can t accept that they will die. The afterlife is a man made concept made to provide hope and control to people. Without an afterlife there is virtually no need whatsoever for religion.  Once you recognize this your life changes and you start living your life with the realization that everyday is important as you only have one life. My job is to make sure people have long lives and stay healthy and free of diseases but I accept and understand death very well. It is because I understand it that I get mad when I hear preachers talking about the afterlife...they make people waste their only time on this planet by filling their heads with nonsense and myths all apparently to worship an entity that has not demonstrated itself and that being so powerful could not wait until the 21st century to reveal itself but had to do it in the 7th century by borrowing from earlier Jewish and christian mythos. Ask yourself why that entity having control of time and space chose to reveal itself to an illiterate desert sheep herder during the iron age instead of to a Nobel prize winner of the 21st century?  Also when you die it is not that nothing happens...your body decomposes and its content returns to the cycle to be...recycled. Nothing is created everything is transforned. You were made of star dust and after you pass your body will return to dust which is why it is important to make this life worthwhile by not being controlled by religion. Also the afterlife was never demonstrated to exist...why? Because it is a man made concept and not a real state of being. You can not discard the laws of chemistry and physics to fit your narrative UNLESS you are a 7th century or earlier person without any knowledge of chemistry, physics, biology, astrophysics, geology etc..."
exmuslim,3dq8mw,Mujahid-of-Kufr,2,Sat Jul 18 16:26:59 2015 UTC,"If one day a few thousands years later humanity, if not extinct by that time, comes up with a superadvanced technology capable of temporarily stopping electrical interaction between brainly neurons to experience death what it is like when there's no basis for space-time by virtue of lacking self-awareness and conciousness.. or if humanity opens the way to overcome mattery's enthropy, polishes cryoconservation technologies, overcomes all known diseases, somehow finds a way to stop biological aging through genetic engineering or, i dunno, by using grown ""in vitro"" internal organs, and also finds the way to enhance cognitive abilities of one's brains to deal with infinite long lives (and thus having to obtain sorta unlimited memory), solves mundane problems (lack of natural resources, overpopulation, space colonization etc.) or i don't know what else? Do you think that such a transhumanist sci-fi future coming true can kill religion completely? I think some part of belief in supernatural will always occupy part of human's mind, be it a religion or random superstitious practices like ""spit back through your shoulder if a black cat runs across you"". Belief in supernatural can easily be justified by science. For example, what caused Big Bang, which we assume to be the beginning of the universe because we know it expanding? There was no time as a concept before, space was not there, it was infinitely dense infinitely small point, mathematically equal to zero! And if there is no space-time, there was no technically the moment BEFORE it happened. And thus, there were no cause. Spontaneous Big Bang with no possible physical explanation hence our known physical laws stop working there! An event with no cause, no causality! One could easily not comprehend it. One may also ask ""what the universe is expanding into?"". When there's no to explain, you may turn to easiest explanation, even if untrue. Thus, i believe, even when organized religions die after being disproven (a few hundred years left, i think by year 30th century we won't have a single Abrahamic religions' follower on Earth and Solar system colonized by that time and maybe a few Dharmic ones' (mere hundreds of thousands outta trillions of people) if any at all), still for many God will be a perfectly reasonable answer as it was to me."

I kept thinking that one day someone I love will die and we'll NEVER see him again. And that I will die and won't know anything about the ones who love me.   I'm starting to think that that's the beautiful part of life. It's so fleeting and the world continues to go on even after your death; you understand how insignificant you are compared to the entire universe. It's really humbling imo.

When I was 6 years old, I went to Bangladesh and visited my village (literally the property of my great-great-great grand fathers) and spent a lot of time with my mum's aunt (they had a colour telly, mum didn't like us having one) and got really fond of her. And one day, I watched her die. I woke up early in the morning, went to her home from our house, stepped inside and saw her, quiet, off-colour and just not responding to anything I said.  It was heartbreaking and I have never forgotten it. I guess it's why I'm sentimental about parents and aunts and uncles, because they will die and I want to show them as much love and kindness as I can, whilst we all have the time here and now.  That said, I have a belief that death is just another experience that we go through, I don't believe in a restrictively dogmatic materialism. I think we can't know certain things because Materialism is by definition based upon elaborations from a fractional trace amount of the infinite. We just don't know anything with absolute certainty.  I had a serious illness a few years ago, life threatening. I remember that it was the first time I was genuinely ""tested"" and I felt nothing. No prayers to any god, no curses either, just a sort of numbness that slowly gave life to a resolution to live and get better. I am alive only because I overruled medical science as conveyed to me by two of the top neuroscientists in London at St. Barts and Royal London, so I'm always healthily sceptical of dogmatic materialism."

In practice science descends into dogmatism and you have to keep your wits about you, lest you fall victim to the dogmatist's abuse of relative power.  Two neuroscientists tried to convince me that I would be paralysed from the neck down, for life, if I did not have a pioneering operation within days of diagnosing this condition that was affecting me.  I went online and did my own research into the symptoms, other people's experiences and potential ""cures"". Then went and pushed my GP for access to specific drugs I thought would be able to resolve the issue, alongside a dietary change and after a year ... All better.  I actually have the MRI scans on file, that indicate that I should not be able to move or use my hands at all, because of the prominent compression between my cervical vertebrae. And yet, I have been well for close on 3 years now and, to add insult to (potential) injury, they refuse to do another MRI scan because their assessments and tests indicate that I no longer have the problem that they diagnosed.  Science is wonderful, people speaking for Science, not so much. Barely any better than medieval quacks and priests, in my experience."

exmuslim,3dq8mw,Likuet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:32:52 2015 UTC,I am alive only because I overruled medical science as conveyed to me by two of the top neuroscientists   What does that mean exactly?
exmuslim,3dq8mw,Likuet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:40:12 2015 UTC,"What does that mean exactly?    It's a slightly hyperbolic summation of a situation.  It means that I ignored their recommendation for a pioneering operation upon my cervical vertebrae, instead going by my own research into the condition and my hypothesis that the compression was related to other problems in my vit D levels and would not be a problem if I tackled them instead.  The surgery would have given me limited mobility, but removed the compression and any chance of immediate (and permanent) paralysis. The only data they had on the long term effects of the surgery, the trauma to the spinal discs, was a 10 year study on the over 60s. Which was of no value to me, a man in my early 30s.  At the time I could barely stand up, and was experiencing more and more days of partial paralysis and some times even in my upper body. It was quite horrific.  Once I convinced my GP to look into my blood work, to focus on the things I'd begun to learn about and try and sort them out. We had a simple plan of action to test out.  After three months of aggressive - way over RDA - injections of a particular form of vit D3, I went from not being able to walk, to being able to walk 30 minutes from my home to the hospital in order to sign the letter stating that I was ignoring the neuroscientist's recommendation that I have immediate surgery.  I had to take a taxi to Barts' and under go some tests there too, but they couldn't force me to have the operation and I could feel myself improving as my D3 levels rose to near normal.  Almost two years ago now, I went to another hospital to have a final series of tests to see how my body was coming along. I passed them and the doctor that ran the tests admitted that I had actually gotten well. He also agreed with me that the surgery would have been far worse for me, on balance.  Eventually I asked my GP to write a letter to the neurologists at Barts and Royal London, explaining that their recommendations and diagnosis may not be right for all people that manifest the symptoms I did.  I also requested to undergo another MRI, but was turned down because I was healthy again."

I've got a lot on, personally, but I plan to revisit this whole incident in the future. I was just amazed at how little specialists know, outside of their field. And how large the ""blind spot"" is.  I got my GP to write a letter to the neurologists to tell them that they were wrong and they need to revise their approach a little.  I wanted another MRI scan so that I could prove definitively that the protruding disc tissue had dissolved, but they weren't interested in pursuing the matter further and just said that I was medically sound and needed no further testing (they didn't want to waste the money on needless MRI scans).  All I want now is to get back to mental fitness. The way my D3 levels crashed, caused severe problems for my brain, effectively almost retarding me.  I was holding down a highly technical job and doing very well, so I didn't notice that my thinking was foggier and more encumbered than it used to be. I might even have attributed a slowdown in the rate at which I pick up new skills and concepts, to growing older (and having more things on your mind at once), but ... Now I can see it takes me longer to arrive at the kind of performance level I used to have.  Sometimes that can be difficult to handle. I feel like I've fallen very very far."

Maybe in 200 years we will be able to live for a long long time. Its pretty straightforward as to why we age and die. I really wouldnt be surprised if we could stop the process in the next 200 years.

I'm also not a fan of mind altering substances, having had alcohol on a few occasions. As far as the anxiety associated with the mentality of being raised in a Muslim family, I have it too. It's the byproduct of not going along with the religion and it fucking sucks. Anyone in this position has fears about the future. My personal worries are marriage, or finding a soulmate, as well as maybe having to tell my parents someday. I want to avoid that, as I don't want to break their hearts. When it comes to marriage, the best way to appease them that I can think of is to find a like-minded Exmuslim girl who wants to do the same for her parents. I have to scoff whenever an Imam says that we are blessed for being born to a Muslim family. Honestly, it's a shitty situation that stirs up resentful feelings. I always envy friends who grew up without these issues."
exmuslim,3doumx,Salger12,5,Sat Jul 18 01:48:31 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I did. My parents have disowned me multiple times for having relationships with kafir white women. To the point that every relationship failed because the woman was tired dealing with the antipathy and blackmail from them as well as watching me fall into a depression spiral from having them try to sabotage us. (I should note though this wasn't always the reason for breakup. Been in a couple unhealthy relationships where parents were a complicating factor but not the primary reason for ending it. But on more than one occasion the relationship was maturing and growing healthily only to be destroyed by the constant attempts of my parents to break us up, which is too much to handle for most people after months and years of the same shit.)  Luckily I met a ""Muslim"" girl that they agreed  to allow me to see (though of course that they expected I would meet with only under Islamic pretexts) and lucky for me she's herself also an exmuslim. At first I thought she was a believing Muslim that just didn't pray all the time and wear hijab. This was great. She knew that I was irreligious but was accepting of me regardless. At the time I was prepared to let her have her religious beliefs and I would have mine and just live in peace about it. A few months in I realized she is a full blown apostate but just tries to keep it secret and when I found this out it made our relationship much stronger because I knew I had someone who could understand all the struggles I've had to endure since I started having romantic relationships almost 10 years ago (that, as I said, were constantly being destroyed on purpose by my parents).  Been together for a year so far and we are beyond happy, but do realize if/when we get married they'll eventually realize we are both kafirs. Luckily at this point I'm completely financially independent (I have much more disposable take home income than my father and mother combined after expenses) so they cannot use threats of disowning to financially ruin my life. Also my girlfriend is almost done with her degree so we will be DINKs soon (dual income no kids) and I've already bought a house (on my own income) so they can't come into my property willy nilly and tell me what to do anymore. (This pisses my father off quite a bit).  Not saying everyone will be as lucky as me to find another likeminded apostate that happens to be beautiful AND (most importantly) a kind hearted loving individual. And maybe you're not even attracted to people of ethnic backgrounds that would typically lend themselves to being ex Muslims. But if you can, then you'll feel like you hit the jackpot."

Turkey, Israel and the United States are all plagued by religious fundamentalists. The problem Israel has is that is was established by the backing of former colonial powers (victors of the second world war).  There have been wars between Israel and its neighbors for a good while. The Arab states have always lost. Not only that but the occupation of the West Bank and the siege, and I use that word loosely, of Gaza.    It's a very interesting history. The part that's ironic about the video is how they reference how the Quran says Jews are scum, but they forget the prophet lived the latter years of his life in a city that was inhabited by lots of Jews.   Robert Wright wrote an interesting book. Its The Evolution of God. It's an interesting read. It talks about how game theory shapes how people live. People try to go for a win-win instead of a win-lose or lose-lose. It shows how as a minority, Islam was fine with other religions, even paganism (win-win). As time progressed, they began to move away from this and to a win-lose in favor of only their religion.  Quite an interesting read. Highly recommend.   Edit: some grammer"

And I'm sure you would agree with that as well. The ghetto communities I have seen here are detrimental to society. Obviously assimilation takes time, but in many cases it's not happening at all. People don't have to assimilate culturally, but they can at least adopt the principles of freedom -- which many ghettos don't allow the individuals within them through the way of strictly enforced primitive norms.   But I'd agree that this sub has an issue with people that believe in a hierarchical view of the world and want to support their twisted perspectives.

Or is it only indigenous people who have to give up tradition andheritage, whereas immigrants have a right to their culture? The last time I checked people came to America because they wanted to become American and this is why this country was united and worked. Now we get muslims and they say 'your culture is shit and filthy and we don't want to assimilate' and people like you clap and shout 'keep your own culture' while at the same time insisting the host country should give up heritage and tradition because not doing so would be 'undemocratic'.

It seems to be the same rhetoric being used now to call upon the deportation of millions of people, the vast majority of whom have not committed a crime to warrant any legal course of action.   That was my point.   As far as assimilation is concerned, I clearly said that immigrants should only be from countries that respect contemporary democratic values. I said that explicitly.

I get some people have a deep hate towards Islam but I didn't realise that other people would firmly believe deporting Muslims (although you can't really deport a white convert or a Muslim that is born here) would mean terrorism would be gone. It's so stupid if the mods are able to ban these people it would be great.
exmuslim,3dnzeg,BekasRusa,5,Fri Jul 17 22:55:10 2015 UTC,"Uh, so you want to ban people you disagree with? You also don't care if people die as a result of immigration? I get It. Tells me a lot about your personality, trust me."

exmuslim,3dnzeg,Dayandnight95,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:14:23 2015 UTC,"Ok I'm sorry I don't actually think people should be banned I was just really angry yesterday. I think it's because when I was younger I used to be attacked by a large group of white kids whenever I would wear the hijab, it was so bad that I wasn't ever allowed to walk on my own to and back from school. So I've seen this deep hate that can result from people that don't like Islam and how they can dehumanise Muslim people to even then justify hurting any person even a 10 year old girl who isn't doing anything but kinda looks like what they stereotype as a Muslim.   I guess what I wanted is a safe space not just from that kinda hate but also where people can talk about their issues within Islam. I agree Muslims have a problem but I don't think this lets deport all of them is gonna help and if being called greedy because 'I just wanna keep my my citizenship' is why people are trying to justify this then they haven't actually listened an their probably not an exmuslim."
exmuslim,3dnzeg,FlyboyRocks,3,Sat Jul 18 07:39:44 2015 UTC,I agree. Ignorance is a bliss. Esp. if it is people who have to hide being ex muslims yet still defend islam and muslim immigration which makes their countries eventually the same these people ran away from.

exmuslim,3dnzeg,GreatWalker,4,Fri Jul 17 23:18:07 2015 UTC,"If you have tissue that appears to be malignant, you cut it out. All of it. There's 3 independent polls showing up to 80% of muslims in France and the UK at least have some sympathies for ISIS. Your 'not all muslims' argument doesn't work because it is not correct. There is no right to immigration from countries that are bad for the host countries. There simply isn't. And since you correctly mentioned 'it's a democratic country', you will see the Europeans will move further to the right with all the consequences and I am sure you won't like them. The reason this is will happen is, among others, the fact that people like you rather ignore the problems or blame 'white supremacists'  instead of attacking the source of it all: muslims. Maybe you should also ask yourself why Europeans have no problem with immigrated Chinese, Vietnamese or Caribbeans. I think it is time to take some responsibly and stop pointing your finger."
exmuslim,3dnzeg,Dayandnight95,2,Fri Jul 17 23:30:56 2015 UTC,That's a horrible analogy and you can use it to justify any gross abuse of human rights where innocent individuals suffer due to the actions of other people. It'll do more damage to the democratic institutions of Western society than Muslims themselves.   You can't say that Muslins threaten the destruction of Western society and then use that logic to destroy it yourself by pissing on the constitutional foundations of the country.  There is no way any sane person could believe that mass deportations are a reasonable idea. Not only will it absolve the basic essence of Western society it'll lead to tremendous backlash.

It's like saying not all black people are criminals, but there kids or grandkids might be in the future, therfore all black people should be deported as a precaution. This logic falls short.    Would any muslim country accept it if millions of Christians suddenly immigrated, started to build churches   No. But since when did these countries become a standard to aspire for? Also i never said mass immigration was a good idea.    convert and kill muslims and threaten the state and society as a whole?    See, now you are exaggerating.

exmuslim,3dnzeg,hugga4u,2,Sat Jul 18 22:10:26 2015 UTC,"Naa, I don't think so.   But if the majority of Muslims where radicals, trust me, you'd notice because there would be no ""Europe"" left.    Perhaps go to east London, Rosengaard in Stockholm or Malmo. Or parts of Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Antwerp or the banlieues in Paris. I have lived in Europe for over 27 years and the change that happened within the last 15 years is stunning. Perhaps you haven't been here long enough to realize this is not normal and one actually does  notice. Malmo, Rosengaard used to be whiter than white, peaceful,and a great place to live. Now not even the firefighters want to go in there without police protection and the Jews who lived there for generations have to fear for their lives. So much for your 'nothing would be left'. For many people who originally lived in these expanding muslim areas, actually nothing is left indeed because they were forced to move out. You really think this is an enrichment? You are talking out of your ass and have no point except for the usual 'be tolerant and don't ask too many questions' crap.   But since when did these countries become a standard to aspire for   What a convenient excuse. Whatever is to your advantage, huh? Seems like you have some standards for them and others for us. Very convenient. They also call it double standard. Or hypocrisy. You are basically saying westerners should just suck it up because that's the right thing to do. I just wonder right for whom? And who defines that? You perhaps?  Nice try.   it is hardly the norm   Rape and terror have skyrocketed all over Europe. Sweden is now the rape capital of the world just behind Lesotho. Over 90% of rapists are immigrants, most from muslim countries. Same in Norway, Denmark etc. Do I need to mention the Pakistani child grooming gangs in the UK, almost exclusively muslims? And if most muslims  (i.e. the norm) didn't agree with it, why don't they kick the muslim bigots and terrorists out and report them? Would be easy. Every other ethnicity does that. I admit that happens every once in awhile, but not even nearly enough.  Perhaps most of them sympathize with the extremists, knowing what they do is mandated by islam? Yeah, it is the norm and whatever you claim is not going to change that.."
exmuslim,3dnzeg,hugga4u,2,Fri Jul 17 23:35:58 2015 UTC,"So you give me a couple examples where mass immigration has failed and claim this is the norm? Nice try, but no. I live in Sweden, i know what a gigantic failure immigration has been in this country. Doesn't mean this applies to all of Europe.   You make some good points, but your ""solution"" is completely ridiculous. You seem to think mass deportation is the way to go. Why stop with the Muslims? Let's deport anyone who causes trouble (I.e Thieves, Murderers, rapists etc.) and while we are at it we might as well deport anyone remotely related to these criminals (Through race, culture or family), as a precaution of course. Screw the law and the right to be judged in court. Also someone in this thread pointed out that alot of Muslims are born and raised in Europe. Do you think they should also be deported? Do there citizenships hold no weight in your eyes? Do you have more of a right to live in the west than them?   Do you know any Muslims in real life? Any Muslim friends? Or are you really so delusional that you think all muslims are either crazy islamists or ticking time bombs ready to be radicalized at any second?   Edit: Rape statistics in Sweden can be misleading:  ""The Swedish police record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately, leading to an inflated number of cases compared to other countries. Sweden also has a comparatively wide definition of rape. This means that more sexual crimes are registered as rape than in most other countries. For example, in 2005 Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider, which led to a marked increase in reports. Additionally, the Swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases, in an effort to decrease the number unreported cases. ""  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics#Sweden"

exmuslim,3dnzeg,Mojomaniac666,3,Fri Jul 17 21:45:46 2015 UTC,"you can't generalize and every religion is fucked up anyways. you're right about islam being fucked up, but so is judiasm and christianity, theyre all parasites to a free society.   Bullshit. Not every religion is anywhere near as bad as Islam. Get your Marxist relativism bullshit out of here.  Fucking idiot, you think this country would have been anywhere near as open to abolishing slavery or trying to mediate the evils of its own colonialism if it had been an Islamic country, rather than a ""Christian"" nation (The Church of England not the Catholic variety, they were much more Islamic minded)?  Fuck you, where are the millions of Turks and Arabs begging forgiveness for their rape and pillage sprees? For their colonisation of Europe and India?  Fucking hell you people are sick in the head. No, we're not all equal and no, not all religions are equally awful. Some indeed are inherently superior and make for a better culture."
exmuslim,3dnzeg,Econo91,3,Sat Jul 18 08:58:26 2015 UTC,No one is talking about immigration reform.   We're talking about mass deportations which you keep advocating.
exmuslim,3dnzeg,FlyboyRocks,2,Sat Jul 18 18:12:31 2015 UTC,"How the hell am I selfish, deporting Muslims isn't a SOLUTION it would make the situation worse since you'd be giving them more reasons for the crazy lot to hate the west.   I'm not selfish I know how horrible terrorism is believe me I've had family who have died from it but just deporting Muslims is so fucking stupid you know what's selfish is getting millions of people's livelihood and education taken away because of a supposed threat. I do care about white lives I don't know how you even got the idea that I care less about the death of another person because of their skin colour, but unlike you I'm not going to think it's right that all Muslims in western countries get deported because some are going to go ape shit.    You know posting on reddit isn't even going to do anything right maybe if you were a politician for a western country you might go somewhere but on here not really. You should use this pent up anger on something else."
exmuslim,3dnzeg,Econo91,-2,Fri Jul 17 23:45:07 2015 UTC,"Ahh, so you want the indigenous people in the host countries die like stupid sheep  because you don't want to offend muslims? Seriously? I don't think you care about white lives, no matter what you claim, because otherwise you wouldn't have worded the post the way you did. They are merrily collateral damage to you. Similar to that woman who go shot in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant is just collateral damage to the liberals and their immigration policies. I believe you are only concerned about yourself, which is, I guess, fair enough, but then again you cannot expect others to just sit and watch how their homelands are being destroyed by muslims.  Every people has a right to their homeland, and this, believe it or not, includes white people. How would you feel if millions of redneck Americans would suddenly settle in Mecca or some other muslim place and turn it into a giant Walmart or Burger King? Muslims hate infidels anyway, so nothing will change if they get sent away.  And actually, the more I think about it, deporting muslims, at least the immigrated ones in Europe, would be a very good solution."

exmuslim,3dost5,Bloody-smashing,8,Sat Jul 18 00:51:59 2015 UTC,"Taking the last name of your husband is patriarchal. It is based on the system of Christian patriarchy.  because the man ""owns"" the woman after marriage and she becomes his family because she becomes the mother of the family and the one that is obligated to breed instead of lead.  Muslims think the same way, however keeping a woman's name after marriage is NOT based on sharia, it is actually based on pre-Islamic traditions where the woman and the man are EQUAL to each other and that she can be the ""ruler"" of the house like he does. She can even own men and women as slaves (like how aisha did) this is the reason why Muhammad hated women, he wanted men to rule so he began to take the Christian patriarchy thing and oppress them.   No its not based on sharia and no I don't like when a woman takes the name of her husband and changes her own., why doesn't he change hie own name as well? Is her identity so unimportant that she have to change to his?  Fuck that. Women should keep their name and be proud of it, daughters should take their mothers names instead of their fathers. Sons should take the father."
exmuslim,3dost5,Allah-Of-Reddit,2,Sat Jul 18 01:02:58 2015 UTC,"I'm all for creating a new last name when you get married and both partners changing their name to something new.   My surname doesn't make sense following Islamic naming or western. It makes tracing my family line extremely difficult.  My grandparents on both sides gave all their kids random surnames. My mum and her siblings all had different surnames. Same with my dad and his.  I just find it funny how something as trivial as a name can ""exclude"" you from paradise even if you follow all the other rules."
exmuslim,3dost5,CrackaBox,3,Sat Jul 18 02:16:48 2015 UTC,"Islam arose in a tribal society where there were no last names, your name was the name of your patriarchal ascendants in order. Ex: Ali ibn(son of) Mohammed ibn(son of) Umar ibn(son of) Abdullah. This practice from what I can tell still goes on in muslim countries. Like Ayaan Hirsi Ali; Ali is not a family name it's her grandfather's name and Hirsi is her father.  So when Islam says you can't change your last name it's about a primitive honour code to your ancestors. This links back to when Muhammad made illegal to change the last names of your adopted/foster child. Personally I don't mind women not changing their names, some might even enjoy it, but not changing your adopted/foster child is wrong.  I don't remember anything about going to hell for it though, or it even being condemned as sinful. Is it a hadith or something because it's not in the quran?"

Their argument is that it isn't in the Quran or the sunnah, which means if you do it, you're copying the traditions of kafirs, ergo it is haram. There's no concept that there are traditions or practices that can be performed or practiced entirely outside of religious custom (aka culture) because Islam is not just a religion, it's a complete way of life (including culture).  Also in the quotes he uses to support his claim he ignores the pronouns ""him"" and ""himself"". It's pretty clear to me that these are describing a man who denies his patriarchal line. Not to say his bullshit argument is any more valid even if it encompassed both genders, but that he doesn't even have ground to stand on from his own source material."

Even though the stupid people causing problems are just deluded indigenous Muslims who think they're somehow partly Arab.  Unlike China and Japan, India's development is uniquely indigenously driven and contrary to the prevailing notions regarding how an economy develops.  It went from agriculture to advanced value added services and software engineering. From raw materials export to banking and entertainment export.  Very different from any other nation.  One of the upsides is that India has a huge technical and professional base, as well as a profoundly sophisticated society, buried within the mass culture.  It's democracy gives agency to everybody and makes people feel a part of society and vested in the project of India's development (or, when the Left get into things, ruination).  The main drawback, it has 600M+ people in abject poverty and no feasible way to stop them from breeding more and more and more poverty.  If you broke India down into individual nations, I bet you'd have two or three proper first world nations in there.  As far as religion goes, the only problem is Islam.

In contrast Islam does not contain different philosophies and is very rigid.    Lol. Take a course on Islam from any reputable University with a serious oriental studies department. I guarantee you, you will never hear that funny statement. Islam is full of different philosophies and is incredibly diverse in multiple ways.   Any attempt to change it is called bidah.   Bidah is a term specifically restricted to matters of worship. In secular realms ALL things are automatically permissible unless otherwise proven through canonical sources, which leaves the door open for countless (literally) actions.

A lot of the world is behind and you could just as easily delineate it in terms of geographical zones, historical interactions, land conditions, war, colonialism, current (often secular) political situations, etcetera before turning it all to Islam. This is just silly. The rise and fall of nations in terms of progress is highly complex and happens for all sorts of complex yet demonstrable reasons (and yes, religion can be a part of it).. that's why it is studied with such rigor.  And as far as moon sighting is concerned; calculations aren't ""the devil"" as someone implies down here. Muslims have historically been the leaders in astronomical calculations with scholars from the first millennium (AD) still being cited authoritatively in modern text books. The Muslims have historically loved this stuff like none of you here ever have. The issue with moon-sighting is that there is an explicit requirement (for the ritual of fasting, hajj etcetera) for the crescent (different from the ""new moon"" which Muslims have never had problems calculating and still don't) to be sited. IT'S PART OF THE RITUAL,,, just like fasting and eid themselves are RITUALS! The whole point is to do it a certain proscribed way and sighting is part of the proscription. They don't have a problem with calculating astronomical movements for any other reason.  You guys should at least understand the opposing view (some rudimentary underpinnings at least) before confirming amongst yourselves and congratulating each other for being so sciency.

exmuslim,3dl2zh,Allah-Of-Reddit,3,Fri Jul 17 05:48:28 2015 UTC,"I think what you might not have done is to think outside of the box.  I learnt my lesson of people refusing ""1+1=2"" when debating with Jehavoh's Witnesses (Ahmadis of Christianity) as a muslim and that was the reason I went on a journey which led me to be an ex-muslim.  Islam is nothing special, it's existence is not because of reasons to do with logic, rationality and the truths of cosmology rather more to do with socio-economic and socio-political endeavours of ""our"" past kings and rulers.  To look at muslims and their practices without having that outlook on the nature of Islam as a religion is like looking at a rainbow in black and white. Muslims aren't stupid because they believe Muhammad to be a nice person despite all his shortfalls highlighted in their own accepted history of him, they are irrational and predictably irrational just like all people  I was recently watching a debate between Heina Dadhaboy and David Wood about ""Does God Exist?"". David Wood is the guy who is a great source of information if you go looking for points against islamic claims yet he is ""blind"" to be able to see that  the critical thinking he applies to Islam also demolished his own religion. Is David Wood stupid? Clearly not, he is irrational.   Outside of religion, I've had general debates/discussions with individuals about scientific matters, where the answer was definite but the other person was being egotistic and refusing a good argument because they didn't want to accept they were wrong and THAT is the other key don't challenge people's egos and don't debate to ""win"" rather to help. If you are debating to prove others wrong and yourself right then you will have limited success but if you debate trying to help another human being become a better person then you will find greater success with that.  The endowment effect is a good place to start to understand why people might reject proofs which you think are sufficient to disprove their beliefs.    ."

That means there's a huge bias in them, some are most likely missing and some are added.   That doesn't mean Aisha wasn't fine with the marriage. We can't even say if Aisha really existed. But we can pretty confidently say that hadiths serve the religion, not historical or biographical documentation. Portraying Aisha as an oppressed wife doesn't serve islam's goal.   Aisha - for us - is just a fictional character, nothing more than another Cinderella."

exmuslim,3dl2zh,Cogdis24,4,Fri Jul 17 08:49:01 2015 UTC,Two of my family members married when they were 9. I never talked to them personally but I have heard their stories so I think I can explain this a little.   They suffered most of their lives one way or another. They had no other option. They were married off without any say in it. They were raped and then got pregnant every couple of years and gave birth to child after child.They mourned their loss of childhood for sometime but eventually they got used to their new reality as most humans do.  Nobody sympathized with them because it was the norm and everyone else was dealing with their own shitty lives.

One reason for this is my concern for Aslan’s apparent credential inflation. Aslan routinely identifies as as scholar of religion, despite his academic post being in creative writing and not having, from what I have been able to ascertain, a single refereed publication. Indeed, he has from what I can tell only one scholarly publication, in a non-refereed journal that does not accept unsolicited submissions (i.e., it’s highly unusual and not part of mainstream academic conversations).   While he has written numerous books on subjects ranging from the historical Christ to political Islam, all of these books are in popular presses, rather than academic ones. Aslan’s PhD is in sociology, and his dissertation research was apparently on the study of Islamist social movements, which does much to explain his perspective but which does not necessarily situate him in the sociology or anthropology of religion.  With all due respect to the rarity with which scholars are willing to do what Aslan does, and the man’s many well-reviewed popular books, I see him as a charlatan, at least when it comes to his self-presentation in his media commentaries. He claims the mantle of scholarship without producing scholarship, and claims to be a scholar of religions while advancing theoretically problematic views not held by sociologists of religion (despite his background being in sociology). His defence to (possibly bigoted) attacks upon Muslims is to respond with false or dissembling claims, and while I am sympathetic to the epistemic limits of sound-bite territory, he doesn’t offer follow-up clarifications either.   I've seen this same criticism on /r/askhistorians before. Aslan is a pop-historian."

I saw some people challenging them on r/Islam as, in the modern world, slaves would be prisoners of war and should be subject to conditions provided by the Geneva Convention. Not rape and being sold. They did amazing mental gymnastics to try and get around this issue. Any minute now, Hakim or the canjeero twins or the new alternate ids they have now will come in and give long-winded replies, that I never read as they're too long, as to how this is wrong and then change the subject when they haven't got an answer, all the while erroneously accusing every poster of doing what they themselves are doing.

Their most ""beautiful"" readings involve constant cursing of people with our beliefs, verses that joyously talk about our extreme punishment in this world and the next.  Can you imagine a group of kids anywhere on earth reading such violent language about a specific race, nationality, etc (""kill them wherever you see them"") in unison and being praised for it? Imagine if atheists read stuff like that about believers, and called it beautiful, perfect messages for all time?  The fact that Muslims don't realize the impact of what they're saying, and feel that anyone criticizing islam is an ahole, is a huge problem."

And primarily the push will come from the Liberals, The BBC, Guardian and London's infamous Islington house of horrors.  Muslims are corrupt and will gobble up whatever bribes and favours they can get from having their man in such a position of power and influence, but there won't be any persecution of non-Muslims or anything like that.  It's entirely about ""rubbing the Right's noses in it"". Just like how France got to its present glorious state. The little Marxists just can't help themselves, they need to ruin their own homes to make themselves feel superior to their parents and neighbours.  Muslims were in ""power"" in Tower Hamlets for a short while, got kicked out because of corruption and then lost the follow-up election by a pretty hefty margin as the local non-Muslim population decided to turn up and vote.  I loathe the Muslim community, not just for its shit and degenerate culture but for its criminal stupidity and greed.  Nothing that stupid should be encouraged to breed."
exmuslim,3djt3q,MohammedRidesAgain,7,Thu Jul 16 23:42:23 2015 UTC,Yes the Tower Hamlets situation is how I'd imagine it will end up everywhere a Muslim is in charge. I couldn't believe how long the debacle went on for and how threatened the accusers were. Did that ex mayor get fined or imprisoned?
exmuslim,3djt3q,MohammedRidesAgain,7,Thu Jul 16 23:47:06 2015 UTC,"No prison term and I'm not sure if he was fined or not either, it wasn't a clear cut decision, more political than that, probably because they're all corrupt and singling out this plonker opens them to accusations of ""racism!"".  The man was an utter fool, I met him on a couple of occasions and once had the displeasure to be dinning in the same restaurant as him and his pack.  Sad thing is that he was being steered by people that I know, trying to keep him in power so that they could get in on the council contract scams (all councils are corrupt, it's the nature of politics, but Muslims are just cruder and less aware of the wider ecology, when they scan the system)."

exmuslim,3djt3q,aperturefang,3,Thu Jul 16 23:59:25 2015 UTC,"The checks and balances are mostly illusory, as far as I've seen.  I used to work as an IT consultant for a council, for a couple of years. The state of their record keeping and audit trails was appalling. Shocking, worse than the paper and filing cabinet of old*.  They mislaid millions of pounds, they ""mislaid"" millions more, they repaired properties that didn't need any work done and had a contract with their main private sector partner that was drawn up by the organisation's former leader who, after 2 years in the job, went off to become a director in that private company. It was a 10 year contract, worth at least £30M.  There are a few competent people and institutions but, most of it is just a front. The media image really is more important in society than the actual reality.  * It was so bad that one poxy Excel spreadsheet was being used to manage the expenditure of a £2M annual budget and something like 25% of the data in it could not be audited.  It took me a week to fix the process and put in better checks, cleanse the data and reconcile what could be reconciled, whilst putting in a request for surveys for the rest. I saved them sometime close to £1M from that bit of work and organisationally, they appreciated my shitty Equalities work more than that.  My equalities work wasted a month of my time (I charged at £300/day back then) and produced a lovely map of the borough and ethnic/demographic breakdown on service quality feedback ... Basically something pretty to prove that they're not being discriminatory.  they saw that as a good use of my time!

Keep going, I'm happy to answer your questions; as many as you want.   For those of you who have come out as ex-Muslims or confided in someone, what was their reaction? What were the consequences?   Some of the stuff that happened is rather personal so I'm going to be vague and leave cliff notes:   Someone very close to me in my life nearly cut ties with me entirely when I told them. I managed to salvage this, but things haven't been the same since then. One of my parents knows. The parent is devastated, and is trying to proselytize me back into the faith My other parent doesn't. There's a very good chance they'll disown me. At best the relationship will be severely damaged. Some non-Muslim friends of mine have accepted me and said its cool My Muslim friends don't know. But just for suggesting to them that I don't agree with some Islamic rulings has gotten me judgment With some family members who I thought were liberal, just joking about some Islamic rulings I think are sexist has gotten me lashed out at and told I'm disgusting Most of my friends and family don't know. I can't say for sure what will happen to me, but getting cut off is likely. Judging from the past, when people start to deviate Islamically, the community sticks their nose in your business I frequently try to talk to my Muslim friends and families about slightly alternate ideas about Islam. Like maybe we shouldn't hate gays, or Evolution is true, or even MAYBE WE SHOULD READ THE QURAN IN ENGLISH. I'm often given the cold shoulder, told off or the people get uncomfortable. Only a few people will engage me (I can count them on one hand). I've mostly given this up because of the hostile reactions I've got. It's frustrating to be told over again the same crap like: ""Maybe you should go learn some more"".

I'm a straight white cis male, from a Jewish family (the majority in Israel).  But over here where I live, indoctrination preformed by the Orthodox Jews in their religious schools is often facepalmed upon. Religion is joked upon openly and freely. People never come out of the closet because here there isn't much of an LGBT closet. The (non Orthodox) theists accept us, the atheists, and we treat each other with mutual respect.   I would be just as fine being a lesbian Arab in my particular school and such."

I was once having a conversation with someone who had the typical notion of morality, that it comes from religion only and without religion we would become evil. I threw in some statistical, anecdotal and some logical arguments. In the end he seemed to have relaxed his position on this matter, now morality can exist independent of religion.  You are not the Alima that muslims deserve, but the one they need right now. So they'll hunt you. Because they can. Because you are not their hero. You're their silent guardian, a watchful protector.

Because I dress so modestly, the presumption is that I must be devout, so I can be trusted to refrain from sin more so than someone who is dressed promiscuously.   That is the reason the younger generation and some of the younger immigrant women aswell in the UK have adopted the hijab which is a paradox as they seem to be doing it to gain greater freedoms for themselves from their families. . I think this is maybe the best part for me because this applies not only to ex-muslims but muslims also as you say....   ...I would be able to remain in the closet because many Muslim women do not wear the hijab   I wish you well on your struggles.

Welcome to the club! You are not alone. Although being in the closet is not the best or ideal of the situations, however, with time you will develop certain instincts to survive it. I believe, the importance of the freedom of actions and speech cannot be overestimated, however, freedom of the mind and thinking are above and beyond the other freedoms. And since Islam puts a restriction on your freedom of thought; therefore, having that freedom alone allows you enough oxygen that you can put up with other restrictions. In addition, online forums such as ours allows us enough space to vent to keep our insanity intact.  if you don't mind sharing, would like to know how old are you?

Someday, when you are your own person, perhaps you can begin to reveal your inner voice by offering the right views as you see them rather than the prescribed answers. Even if you do not ever proclaim your beliefs to them, you can be proud of your own strength.  A lesson that was hard for me to learn was hidden within the question: ""If it works, does it matter whether it's true?"" The value I now see in those words is not about whether the religion, writings, or faith are true or not. The value is in my own behavior. If it works, does it matter whether I am saying all the truth?  I hope that you find the peace that your mother wants for you. She might have grown up in a very painful time. Her love might not come in the form of freedom, because perhaps she does not believe that to be what's missing. Forgive her and love her as much as she tries to protect you from the pains of her own childhood."

I wish that I had an answer that would help you in some realistic fashion but for now anyway you're trapped in this masqurade, fully aware of who you really are inside but sentenced to live up to the expectations of your family and their religion.  As evidently smart as you are I think that you know that you'll have to continue on this way until you can find a way to leave your parents in a way that won't rouse their suspicion, perhaps to study Islamic law or some other facet of your religion, that's if your parents would even permit you to do something like that. If you could somehow get some seperation while still retaining their trust you could perhaps then make a move away from them and most likely Pakistan too.  It's refreshing to know that you critically assessed your religion and clearly found it wanting as I believe all Abrahamic faiths to be upon dispassionate, critical, scrutiny. Clearly, as you yourself stated, you only have 4 - 6 more years under direct control of your parents, so, as you've most likely have already done, now is the time to plan your escape while still keeping their trust and financial backing.  I'll close for now but if I can be of any assistence to you by just talking please feel free to PM me anytime. I truly wish you all the best and sincerly hope that you'll find a way out soon enough.

Posts like this basically tell us that in effect, we can't quite believe that women who tell us that really, they're happy to wear the hijab are telling the truth.  Women in Islam, daughters, wives, etc. are effectively so fiercely and totally under the thumbs of their fathers/husbands and other people oppressed into doing the oppressing for them (wives, mothers, aunts, brothers, etc.) that their insistence on it being ok basically can't be taken at face value.  It's like a hostage situation in a bank, no matter how many of the hostages insist that the robbers are really nice guys who won't actually hurt anyone, we can't know if they have guns trained on their heads or not."

I saw people looking like they were having seizures, babbling nonsense words, and crowding around someone how was sick or under stress, humming and moaning like a damp hive of humanity.  it was weird to say the least.  I was taught two different philosophies: in school, I learned that everything can be knowable if you asked the right questions and paid attention.  I learned the names of the planets, the composition of stars, words that brought people to tears and heroes and villians who all believed that you can change the world if you just try hard enough.  In church I learned that asking questions was immoral and unethical.  I could go on and on about the hypocrisy I found in my Christian experience, but I don't see the point in that.  Reddit (and the internet) has enough religion bashers as it is, but I will say that living as a heathen under my father's roof was scary.  My dad, the devout Christian, who was so honest people thought he was a liar, was an abusive alcoholic.  I remember one time I was huddled into this closet-sized half-bathroom, as he was kicking and punching me, and I just felt the cold tiles of the floor beneath my feet as my brain was frantic trying to make it all stop, just stop, and I was paralyzed because he was always bigger than me, stronger than me, faster than me, and I knew there was no escape, no matter how hard I tried. I balled myself up, and covered my sides and head with my arms, crying.  I was eighteen.  The only thought that kept me going was knowing that if I was 13 years old, then I have survived for thirteen years.  Five more years is nothing.  I can keep going for five more years.  Just five more years then I'm out.  Then I turned fourteen, and I knew, just knew, that I had four more years.  Four more years then I'm out.  I can survive this.  It's just four more years.  It kept me going, knowing that I have only a little longer until I could be free to be who I am, see the things that my father did and do THE EXACT OPPOSITE.  I knew I didn't have the money to live on my own, and I often contemplated running away, but I honestly was too lazy to work hard enough to provide for myself (or maybe that's what I believed, after being told it so many times...)  It was scary.  And confusing.  It was like playing a game, and I didn't know what the rules were, and if I asked what the rules were that meant I was stupid.  Despite the fact that I knew we weren't supposed to be spending money on DVD's and eating out when we couldn't pay our electric bills.  Despite telling my stepmother that she was in a pyramid scheme because she was working in a pyramid scheme.  Despite the fact that I slept through most of highschool, finishing all of my tests early with high scores, never taking the extra credit points I earned because I didn't think I deserved them.  Living in that environment for eighteen years, and knowing that you were a heathen, yeah, I had to keep my mouth shut too.  In the end, I just feed myself on my anger and bitterness and resentment.  I became focused on saving myself, getting out, living a better life than what scraps my dad would throw at me.  My only guilt was that I couldn't extract my little sister from there.  She's so dependent on them now that she crumbles at the meer thought of leaving them.  And they're still broke.  A couple quotes for you, an encouragement that you can do this, that you can get out of there and survive:  ""Damaged people are dangerous; they know they can survive"" ~Josephine Hart  ""Scars are the evidence that life has happened"" ~muffinprincess13  Good luck.

exmuslim,3dgqpt,Geofferic,2,Fri Jul 17 10:06:56 2015 UTC,"Hi there. Thanks for sharing your thoughts and feelings; it certainly was a pleasurable read. I am a Catholic Christian male and I have also had my times of struggle in my own context. My best friend is a female Shia Muslim and she is how I'm connected to the Islamic belief system. She has somehow similarly felt the same as you do for a long time now, but I never really could understand her feelings up till now that you so very powerfully and emphatically described.    You took your time to write down all you did for your own personal reasons, I want to take part of my time to respond you in the most dearly and brotherly way I can.   It seems your current struggle, as you put it, could perhaps lead you now and then to nights of painful insomnia, maybe causing tears as well. If you've even shared your aforementioned struggles with other people, the most common attempts to make you feel better are probably either by wishing you luck and strength, or maybe trying to convince you of Islam being the right path (or the wrong, trying to encourage you), or any other way that will barely and remotely make you feel any better.   My own attempt of trying to will also be success-less. But, needless to say, as I said, I have also been in your place in my own context. Everyone will keep telling you that time heals all wounds, but no one can tell you what exactly you’re supposed to do right now. Right now you feel how you feel: fearful of taking a decision, maybe unable to sleep. It’s right now that you can’t eat in peace due to an ugly constant discomfort. Right now you still have to engage in enormous amounts of deception and self-suppression. Right now you feel the stress of that abhorrent-hypocrisy-coat you want to undress from and which dictates the way of living and thinking your life. Right now all you seem to want to do is cry. You know all about time and wounds healing, but even if you had all the time in the world, you still wouldn’t know what to do with all this hurt right now, because... look at yourself: you will never pass for a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter. Can it be you're not meant to play this part? Now you see that if you were truly to be yourself, you would break your family's heart. You just keep wondering when will your reflection show who you are inside. When you'll stop going through life with a disconnect between who you look like you are and who you actually are (quoting Mulan's song there for you :P ).   We already know the human heart is constantly on a quest for happiness. That's all you want out of this and any situation: happiness. What I advice you to do is to find the courage to find your own happiness once and for all. Many ethics and philosophies claim to be the key to achieving happiness. But make sure the philosophy you live your life by is lead and filled by truth, sincerity, and authenticity. Whether you decide to leave Islam or not, whether you stop believing in a deity's existence or not, I personally find living by giving yourself to others what immediately and eventually brings you peace, happiness and self determination.   As a reminder, today, as always, people want to witness someone –anyone– living an authentic life. Someone striving humbly but heroically to live by what is good, true, and noble in the midst of the so called Sin. To do so you need to be free. And freedom is but the strength of character and the self-possession to do what is good, true, noble, and right.   With not much, I wish you all the best, complete stranger. You can make the world a little bit better. You, among so many others, are perfectly fit and capable of putting your so many talents into the service of others. Cheers from Spain."

I also always thought that the story of Abraham in the Bible was screwed up, although we didn't have to celebrate it. But when I had a son the meaning became clearer to me. In a very primitive way, the story is trying to explain to people who have an intense love of their children that Abraham loved God even more than that."

Why wouldn't some whites think they're superior, given the disgusting morals of Muslims and even ex-Muslims (who all go Liberal because it gives them advantages, ignoring the damage Liberal ideology does to Europe and America).

The West's values include kicking out the Jews, repeatedly, when they became too onerous, kicking out many religious minorities and extremists (Pilgrims?), annihilating religious groups (Cathars), interning whole ethnic groups during wartime - The Japanese Americans during WWII.  The hippy-dippy stuff that the media blather about is just a hold over of CIA propaganda during the Cold War. When they needed to make The West look more appealing, so as to prevent little retarded statelets from going Commie.  Even Free Speech isn't actually very widely held in The West.  Western values (actual stuff, not ideals that the media markets) are all about providing greater freedom, greater exchange of ideas, greater opportunity to develop yourself ...  The stability of their societies are what permit this ""freedom"", Islam and Muslim behaviour is a direct attack on that very stability."
exmuslim,3djnki,hugga4u,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:34:34 2015 UTC,"Western values are about making mistakes and learning from them, not repeating them again and again.

We also enslaved black men a hundred odd years ago, that doesn't make it right or something we should return to.  If you actually think that mass deportations are a good idea - of a group of people that have vastly done nothing illegal or unethical than you probably don't belong in a Western country. On one hand you want stability and on the other hand you want the deportation of a few million people - how do you think society would respond to that?

exmuslim,3djnki,MohammedRidesAgain,0,Fri Jul 17 12:32:09 2015 UTC,"No, I'm specifically saying that ""Western values"" is a meaningless basis upon which to argue for special treatment of Muslims. It is merely a rhetorical device with no actual substance when you look at actual Western history.  How are these ""values"" (that you just plucked from nowhere), specifically Western or in any way largely associated with Western societies? They surely have no particular heritage within Western history. Nor does the average Brit, European or even American seem to be keen on this kind of value.

I can't believe I'm having to argue against mass deportation in the fucking 21st century.   This is an entirely Western value - the departure from religious derivation of laws and values has allowed Western civilization to continuously progress - faster than all other societies. Western society is the product of the Age of Enlightenment, read up on it and enlighten yourself.    Nor does the average Brit, European or even American seem to be keen on this kind of value.   That's just bullshit. You don't think a secular society where all individuals are equal is a Western value? Why the fuck has the West then been on the forefront to give women rights to vote, allow the integration of blacks into mainstream society, etc? If this is not a value the ""average"" Western individual is keen on why spend so much time, effort and blood on these values?   You seem to be confusing remnants of your Muslim and Middle Eastern identity with Western values. Which is really sad. Even as ex-muslims we are destroying Western society, the irony is brutal.   Immigration of Muslims into Western society has eroded it, this is undeniable. What you guys are arguing for will destroy it at a much quicker pace."
exmuslim,3djnki,MohammedRidesAgain,0,Fri Jul 17 12:45:30 2015 UTC,"No, you're confusing a Liberal agenda with Western values, and using that to propound some sort of case for yourself. Yes the majority of people have not been consulted on or asked for all this ""progress"", you actually talk to European people, offline?  I am arguing that the basis of your argument is nothing but empty rhetoric, that ""Western values"" do not amount to some absolute freedom, equality, acceptance or openness. That is all. As I have repeated before, you are basing your whole moral authority on a rhetorical device, arguing for the preservation of some innately Western principles, without ever establishing that they are so, in the first place.  Yes I am familiar with the Enlightenment era, I am also familiar with the fact that the era was chiefly about intellectual contest and not as you depict it, a movement with one direction of ""progress"". For every intellectual lauding the rights of man, you had a counter argument of the necessity of the state to trump these rights.  Again, I say, secularism has nothing to do with what he is arguing nor with my point. Secularism isn't the value being ""pissed upon"" by arguing for deportation (not that I argue for it, but I am sympathetic to the sentiment in others).  You're confusing yourself and his argument with all this nonsense about secularism. The only way the ""western value"" of secularism (remember communism is Atheistic, therefore no official Religious influence on China or USSR ...), could come into this is to support deportation/curbs on Muslims as being necessary to preserve secular society, as Muslims self-identify with a fascist all encompassing ideology that is innately inhospitable to secularism.  Secularism does not mean ""all individuals are equal"" or any other ""progressive"" nonsense, it merely removes one major vestigial organism from the political system. Allowing for greater dynamism within politics. And that too, not wholly, as we have the CofE within our political system, symbolically in the prominence of the Archbishop and the role of Westminster in rituals of government.  Not even in the home of The Enlightenment, did they remove The Church wholly. Instead they reduced its influence and maintained its status for ritual and tradition. Britain is filled with tradition. Not all of it is good for it, but that is part of the actual values that they identify with."
exmuslim,3djnki,hugga4u,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:57:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understood what I was saying at all.   When I say secularism, I'm talking about the idea that man decides the laws and practices of society and that religion is not considered infallible or used to justify primitive practices. In secular Western society you can go from slavery to equality whereas in many Muslim countries child marriage is still a state sanctioned practice, as an example. This is why when you mention the ills of Western society in the past, it has no relevance to what I'm saying - the ideals of a secular society allow for continuous progress and the mistakes of the past (which occur due to the typical knee jerk reactions of emotional and deluded masses that you're sympathetic to) can be rectified and avoided.   Progress is inevitable, it's not an agenda. The proof is everywhere around us. The fact that women have equal rights, homosexuals have equal rights, etc, are a testament to the fact that social conservatism is not viable or even observable in the long run.   Secularism does not mean ""all individuals are equal"" or any other ""progressive"" nonsense   By definition, of course that's not what it means. In practice, it is what it tends to lead to.  If you want you can go ahead and define what you think ""Western values"" are."
exmuslim,3djnki,gobrowns1,0,Fri Jul 17 13:46:48 2015 UTC,"You're basically arguing that Liberalism == ""Western values"", whilst depicting traditional, and popular, values as somehow ""reactionary"" and ""knee-jerk"".  Simply put, you're not defending ""Western values"", you're distorting them to mean whatever makes it easier for you to impose our problems on other people, whilst feeling good about it.  I'd rather we were all deported, myself and my family included - I'm comfortable enough in Bangladesh and India - than be an opportunistic parasite.  My grandfather loved Britain in the 1940s, he moved here and helped many immigrants in the '40s and '50s to adapt and make their home here. These people integrated and within a generation or two had thoroughly blended in. I remember meeting some of their descendants and being shocked to learn that they had English names and no traces of Islamic nonsense left. I used to feel uncomfortable with what I saw as an exaggerated attempt at integration, but on reflection now, I can see the wisdom of it.  My parents moved here in the '70s, not for money, before Bangladesh was even created. They bought a home up North and settled in a community with wonderful English neighbours. My babysitter for most of my childhood was a lovely English lady and the teacher who tried the most to convince my religion infected mother to let me go to grammar school and pursue a better life, was also English, a man who haled from Derby.   These people taught me about their cultures, their customs and traditions, from quaint simple things like the foods that they ate to the sports that were particular to their villages and towns.  This is the England that I learned to love in the '80s. They are a quiet people, mostly, not the brash pushy, grabbing type that London fosters. And this is also why they are being pushed out of the picture, when politicians and ""community leaders"" play identity politics and deny English culture and traditions their rightful place at the heart of this country.  This level of immigration is unprecedented in recorded history, outside of formal colonisation and it cannot work, in the medium term."

I highly doubt that most individuals in the West would favor a move to piss on their legal system and their sense of morality and prosecute innocent people in such large numbers.   Immigration is a separate issue. I'm not advocating for immigration. Immigration is not even necessarily a liberal ideal. Japan has a one nation policy, and that's their choice and decision and  they're doing fine.  But the idea that society changes is pretty much law - it's like entropy. It's going to happen. My point was that this happens faster in Western societies because they don't turn to primitive scriptures, and as far as I can see, it happens for the better. That's all I was saying. There's no point regressing a 100 years and going back to the shitty practices that led to the abuse of the Japanese."

exmuslim,3dnqze,MohammedRidesAgain,11,Fri Jul 17 19:39:33 2015 UTC,"You're expecting a moral response from people?  Morally we are obliged to clean up our shit, but our shit would never have gotten this bad if we were moral people.  There will be an end to this, but it will be unpleasant and painful. And thoroughly our own fault.  The Western Liberals are also to blame though. They encouraged this, rather than demand integration and an acceptance of the culture and values prevailing in the countries immigrants come to, they encouraged the opposite, so as to foster support for their own political agenda."
exmuslim,3dnqze,ShangZilla,2,Fri Jul 17 21:07:00 2015 UTC,"Ahhh the liberal left. You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.  Or is it the fault of the people in those countries because they let it happen under their watch and keep voting same politicians and parties into power.  As T. G. Masaryk said   Democracy has its faults, because people have their faults. Like owner, like store.   I'm more inclined to the second choice. As OP said, Muslims/ex_muslim have a moral responsibility to their countries. Same applies to Europeans. Don't blame the thief for stealing, that's his job. Blame the watcher doing nothing while waiting for the corrupt police to come. Because when the police comes, it's already too late and things already gone."
exmuslim,3dnqze,MohammedRidesAgain,3,Fri Jul 17 22:13:10 2015 UTC,"The thief is always to blame. The minute you conscience a thief being a thief as ""that's his nature"", you deny all hope of human beings becoming better than their circumstances.  Not all Muslims are lost to being ""thieves"", but without facing up to the moral bankruptcy of our peoples, we will never better ourselves.  If we need to look outside of ourselves for an example of a people moving away from a martial/fascist ideology and prospering, we can look at Japan after Hirohito and the US' devastating, inhuman slaughter of Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  We shouldn't have to wait for our Hiroshima to see what our arrogant and entitled culture is doing to us.  I agree Western governments have been at fault and are deliberately encouraging our deluded ways in Europe, but we are responsible for ourselves."
exmuslim,3dnqze,ShangZilla,2,Fri Jul 17 22:39:17 2015 UTC,"The point is: You already know the thief is stealing, you know the police is corrupt. Yet you keep doing nothing and tolerate this state. If you identify yourself as citizen of country X you are morally responsible for what happens country X under your watch. Things are changing slowly, but I'm afraid it's too late and seeds for future conflict in Europe are already sown."
exmuslim,3dnqze,MohammedRidesAgain,2,Fri Jul 17 22:45:50 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Though I'm still hopeful that they will stem immigration and a rightward shift in Europe and will be just the nudge for the silent Muslims of some conscience and former/ex Muslims to stand with Europe against what Muslim cultures represent and the dangers that identity politics bring.  We really have nothing to lose by speaking out. And everything will be lost if we don't speak out vocally and forcefully and everywhere.
exmuslim,3dnqze,ShangZilla,2,Fri Jul 17 23:04:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not that naive to think that suddenly majority of those 50 million Muslims in Europe will speak out that homosexuality is perfectly fine with Islam, that they love free speech and criticizing Mohammed is welcomed, that secular law of the land is above laws created by Allah. Then they completely change their views and declare that they apostates and exmuslims are welcome in their families. This won't happen. These things are only possible when population of Muslims are small. Muslim population has reached point of no return in Western Europe. Non-Western European countries can be still saved or damage controlled. But overall the conflict in Europe as whole is unavoidable. Only question is when and how damaging the conflict will be. Cultures with opposite values cannot live peacefully in the same place, conflict is guaranteed."
exmuslim,3dnqze,MohammedRidesAgain,2,Fri Jul 17 23:11:31 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, I think the Muslim problem is chiefly a result of numbers, they can live and integrate in smaller numbers, but once it goes beyond a few hundred thousand, then shit tends to happen... They become politically inclined, they want to alter the society to fit their perverse culture.  Most of the Muslims I know are cultural Muslims, they will support and side with Muslim politics because it costs them nothing and makes them feel like they're a part of something significant.  The reason they're only ""culturally"" Muslim is that they cannot either believe Islamic morals (most of my friends don't believe I'll go to hell for being an open - and loud - apostate, even the fundamentalist keeps up our friendship though his very ""morals"" would compel him to kill me) or cannot themselves abide by them.  These people need their moral economic picture altered. Once that happens, their new equilibrium will be just as cynical as before but, well outside the Muslim identity politics sphere.  I don't imagine this holds true for a great number, but I would hope that it isn't just the case for the five or six ""Muslims"" that I personally know.  Also, this reminds me,  after 9/11 one of my Pakistani uni friends became a raging (and I mean far more vocal and obnoxious than even myself) anti-Muslim. He just could not tolerate it any more. He was never very religious though, but he identified as ""Muslim"" and did Eid, but the extreme change was all because he thought he had to clarify his position in relation to what he saw as a great evil."
exmuslim,3dnqze,ShangZilla,3,Fri Jul 17 23:27:01 2015 UTC,"The problem is, the actions of silent majority of those cultural Muslims matters. By doing nothing and keep being apologists about radical Islam they are basically giving legitimacy to those radical and creating more conflict against themselves. First step to solving a problem is admitting there's a problem. And those majority of moderate Muslims need to face reality and admit there are some SERIOUS systematic problems in Islam, and it's not the fucking ultimate truth and guide for all eternity.   All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing."

exmuslim,3dnqze,str8baller,7,Fri Jul 17 23:40:27 2015 UTC,"If you are a male, financially independent and living in the West, I really think stopping PARTICIPATION in and AGREEMENT with the dogmatic rituals/beliefs of Orthodox Islam is not a terribly hard task.  It isn't explicit. You don't have to make it explicit. You can dictate the conversation if someone tries to confront you. You're a grown ass man, have some dignity."
exmuslim,3dnqze,shilling_for_the_fed,3,Fri Jul 17 20:32:54 2015 UTC,"Someone. Lots of you, need to step up and say, that's enough. That's what has always happened in history. I'm also a 5 foot 2 inch girl and I'm willing to fight, why aren't you guys when it's your fucking fight?"
exmuslim,3dnqze,no_chill_666,0,Fri Jul 17 20:42:06 2015 UTC,"But that is basically what's happening. I'm in the same boat. Even when I was financially dependent on my parents, frequently dropped hints that I didn't agree with certain things I found morally reprehensible: legitimacy of slave ownership and sex with slaves, uncompromising obedience to parents even in cases of abuse, having multiple wives, the unfairness of hijab when men can walk around half naked with no problem, the medieval perspective of women's role as obedient housewives that live to fulfill their husbands sex desires and take care of children. The list goes on and on.  But for most of us, even trying to bring those things up will result in the following. First accusation of apostasy, then distancing of family from you to not appear to their friends that they are shameful enough to tolerate kafirs in their family (appearances are so incredibly in Muslim families), and finally getting disowned financially. In western countries that's where it usually ends; in other countries your community will find out and if you have a couple religious crazies there your life may be in danger from vigilante justice.  Being disowned isn't the end of the world when you're financially independent. It's difficult from a psychological standpoint because humans are social creatures and we naturally want to form and be part of families that love us.  But you'll notice a lot of commenters here are are children, teenagers, and young adults that simply cannot survive without the financial support of their parents. It becomes an issue of doing the prudent thing: holding your tongue until the day you cannot be blackmailed into not fighting something for fear of being homeless and struggling just because of an ideological difference.  However I can assure you that many people like me, as soon as we get to the point where we do not rely on our families to be able to eat a meal or sleep in a bed, move on to not only criticizing the things we find morally reprehensible in Islam. Once the fear of retribution and ruin is gone many of us are not afraid to say that we think Islam is a morally bankrupt and backwards way of life, especially those that have undergone humiliation and castigation from their families for years, even decades. I can atleast attest to this from my own experience.  Now beyond that I don't know what more one can do to ""fight"" than to simply have the intellectual fortitude to let them know that not everyone agrees Islam is the perfect religion. If you're talking about actively trying to change the minds of Muslims, I think that's a lost fight. People who are willfully ignorant or deluded by the materialistic promises of the afterlife and fear of eternal damnation from not submitting are not going to change their mind by a convincing argument. Those people can be condemned to the fate they chose by not using the brain they were blessed to have and simply live out the rest of their lives in misery while the world continues to move on.  But the rest of us are still fighting the good fight in not being afraid to voice our disagreement when the circumstances provide the opportunity to do so. Don't think we don't exist."

I haven't lived yet and I'm not willing to do something to screw up my chances to live. It's selfish, i know. I understand you want us to fight. Hell, I'd fight. I'd try to make people change their ways, or help them understand what's wrong about religion. But they are so deep in their blind faith and bigoted little minds.

exmuslim,3dkwkc,zigg-_-zagg,2,Fri Jul 17 04:04:11 2015 UTC,Yup I spent £100 on my cousin but I did this by buying her whatever she wanted in a shop and taking her out all day. She's not from a good background and she's never had any real toys so I thought she deserved a treat. I've never seen a happier child. I would of given her the money but the think is they won't do anything with it except spend it on sweets or give it to their moms.
exmuslim,3dhq0d,Econo91,26,Thu Jul 16 10:55:13 2015 UTC,"This is a common fallacy in the way Muslims and other religious people think about their holy books. Being relativistic is fine: if slavery was the norm in those times then it makes sense that people accepted it back then.  But the problem comes in when you want to declare Muhammad or Islam as eternally good and moral. You can't have it both ways: either it's relative or its absolute. If Islam is a relative moral system, then it's not relevant anymore because our times are different. If it's an absolute moral system, then its bullshit for allowing slavery and child marriage."
exmuslim,3dhq0d,CadmeusCain,8,Thu Jul 16 13:24:30 2015 UTC,It's a problem historians call presentism. It's the fallacy of attributing current opinion on historical events. It's to stop emotional editorials of a documented occurrence.  The problem is that you are approaching an irrationally defended position with rationality.
exmuslim,3dhq0d,Atheizm,3,Thu Jul 16 11:54:55 2015 UTC,The problem is that we're discussing religion here and moral judgement is necessary in such discussions.
exmuslim,3dhq0d,vestayekta,2,Thu Jul 16 13:58:37 2015 UTC,"It depends on the context. It maybe unsettling to accept that men could take six-year-olds for wives in the 7th century but when that action is taken as a permanent and unalterable precedent for all legally-mandated marriages regardless of its grossly unethical position, then the topic obviously must be approached from all sides and opinions."
exmuslim,3dhq0d,Atheizm,7,Thu Jul 16 14:15:58 2015 UTC,It's one of their common strategies in debates: How do you know it's bad to kill people?

exmuslim,3dhq0d,vestayekta,3,Thu Jul 16 13:56:10 2015 UTC,"As a matter of fact, even Mo's followers were mad at him when he shagged his adopted son's wife Zaynab.

exmuslim,3dhq0d,Mojomaniac666,2,Thu Jul 16 19:06:30 2015 UTC,"That's the problem. You can't have a book that is supposed to be perfect for all times, and then say that fucking a 9 year old was 'in different times'. Or marrying more than 1 wife was 'in different times'. Bottom line, the book is supposed to be perfect FOR ALL TIME and Mo is supposed to be the example of the perfect man everyone should emulate. It all falls down right there. As an ex catholic, there are plenty of things in the bible that I was embarrassed and ashamed of, like burning witches, so the religion changed it. That's the only reason Christianity survives."

exmuslim,3dmf2r,Meerooo,7,Fri Jul 17 14:13:39 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with that? I don't really understand the anti-Palestine rhetoric. I mean, I get the part where there are Islamists that want to rid the world of Israel, but there are plenty of Christian, secularist, agnostic, and even atheist Palestinians that are still fighting for an identity and they don't support a ""one-state solution""/Hamas. This is coming from a Palestinian ex-Muslim. You'd be very surprised at how many closeted ex-Muslims I know from the West Bank that were born and raised there. And before you hit me with a ""Palestinians don't exist"" argument, I come from a family that is known to have Samaritan roots in the West Bank/Nablus area. I have ancestors that have been there for centuries and have since identified themselves as Palestinians and continue to do that today. Additionally, I'm not the one down-voting you."
exmuslim,3dmf2r,Meerooo,-1,Fri Jul 17 15:49:58 2015 UTC,"It's not whether Palestinians exist or not. It's whether they have a claim to Al-Aksa. Al-Aksa was built on top of a Jewish shrine and a basilica. It's not like Mekka or Medina. Plus if you are claiming to be an atheist, this means you do not recognize the status of Al-Aqsa. Al-Aqsa should not have a meaning for you as an atheist. If you have Samaritan roots this means you are more close to Jews than Arabs. Your ancestors were tortured by Muslims rulers and they converted to Islam out of fear. So you are practically siding with people who tortured your ancestors. I am not even going into how much garbage Hamas and Fattah are and how they are misusing their power."
exmuslim,3dmf2r,Meerooo,7,Fri Jul 17 16:01:39 2015 UTC,"It isn't? That's typically what all your posts about Palestinians consists of which is why I brought it up. Jerusalem is a widely debated topic with regards to Palestinians. It holds a special place in everyone's heart whether Jewish, Muslim, or Christian, Palestinian or Israeli. I do recognize the status; it's clearly more cultural to a lot of people than it is religious. There is historical significance to Jerusalem, and I believe all sides should have the opportunity to call it home. I said I have Samaritan roots, not that I'm 100% Samaritan. My lineage started with Arab/Samaritan mixing. When the Pure-Arabs flooded the area, Islam clearly dominated, and many Samaritans did convert, but that was centuries ago. Samaritans were also persecuted by the Crusaders but you don't see me shitting on Christians. Additionally, Samaritans and Jews don't have the best of histories either. They fought plenty, so your inference of me picking and choosing sides is laughable considering everyone tortured Samaritans. You don't have to get into Palestinian politics at all, I just wanted a general understanding of your opinion other than hating Islam."
exmuslim,3dmf2r,Meerooo,-2,Fri Jul 17 16:20:49 2015 UTC,"Well with your logic, we can easily suggest that Medina is a Jewish city since the first settlers of Medina were Jewish tribes, respectively Banu Nadir and Banu Quaraiza. So according to your logic, Jews can now go claim land in Medina. :) There is no such thing as Pure-Arabs, as Arabs are strongly genetically linked to Jews and other folks in Mesopotamia. The extent that Samaritans were tortured to become Moslems does not measure up to what the Crusaders did."
exmuslim,3dmf2r,Lvl99Bard,4,Fri Jul 17 16:34:32 2015 UTC,"Are you really comparing Jerusalem, a city known for it's religious diversity for thousands of years, to Medina? If you want to make an argument for my ""logic"" you have to make a better case because the histories are very distinguished. But sure, for the sake of ""my logic"", Jews should have the right to return to Medina if they wish. I don't see anything wrong with that.    There is no such thing as Pure-Arabs.    How can you blindly make a claim without research?   Qahtaani Arabs  Also known as Southern Arabs or ""pure Arabs."" They take their name from the alleged patriarch Ya""rub ('i)bn Yashjub ('i)bn Qahtaan. They spoke languages that are collectively known now as Old South Arabic. Qahtani Arabs inhabited southern Arabia, mostly Yemen. They had flourishing civilizations due to advanced irrigation systems which consisted of large water tunnels in mountains, and dams. The most impressive of these earthworks, known as the Ma'<rib dam سَدُّ مَأْرِب and which was built ca. 700 BC, provided irrigation for about 25,000 acres (101 km²) of land and stood for over a millennium, finally collapsing in 570 CE after centuries of neglect.   More information can be found in the source below.  Qahtani Tribes   There is no such thing as Pure-Arabs, as Arabs are strongly genetically linked to Jews and other folks in Mesopotamia   This statement is so black-and-white. There's a lot more to the history of Semitic people than just this.    The extent that Samaritans were tortured to become Moslems does not measure up to what the Crusaders did.   They faced exactly the same type of persecution and forced-conversions. You can hardly say one was better than the other."
exmuslim,3dmf2r,Meerooo,0,Fri Jul 17 17:06:57 2015 UTC,"It's not about the histories but about the meaning of both cities. Medina was religious diversified as well......well until Islam came along of course.  Nice try but Qahtaani Arabs live all the way in Yemen. If you are claiming to be Qahtaani Arab then you have lesser claim to Palestine cause your ancestors were living in Yemen not ""Palestine"".  Plus father of Qahtan was the founder of the Hebrews. So if you are a ""pure Arab"" you are once strongly genetically linked to Jews. :)) https://www.familytreedna.com/public/Arabian_YDNA_J1_Project/  Sure, there is more to the history of Semitic people. Genetically you are Semitic, so am I. I am not an Arab but gene tests has proved that I am partly Semitic.   During the late Byzantine times, the Samaritans had a population of a million, and after they have been Islamized the number went down to 150 in 1910."
exmuslim,3dmf2r,Meerooo,2,Fri Jul 17 17:23:17 2015 UTC,"Nice try but Qahtaani Arabs live all the way in Yemen.   First off, why are you being so condescending? Second, the Qahtaani Arabs originated from the Yemen area but kept immigrating NORTH throughout various countries in the Middle East and adopted different regions as their own which translated into different tribes depending on where they migrated. Tribes reached the Levant and they had presence in the Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Palestine region. You sent me a family tree link that literally explains this and how tribes branched out.   Obviously we're strongly connected to Jews, when did I refute that? That's a point I'm trying to make primarily, but to say that there were no ""pure-Arabs"" is false. There are Arab Jews you know."
exmuslim,3dmf2r,lirannl,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:46:07 2015 UTC,"Why do you feel I am being condensing? Arabic Jews are more genetically linked to Armenians, Kurds and Russians.

They make money off of many Muslims each year that go there to pray and to live that experience, and if they want to make even more money, they would be stupid not to tell other tourists visit their holly city, including inviting famous people, political leaders, and regular folks. Before you know it, this place won't be so holly, and maybe Muslims will see that its just a waste of their money.

exmuslim,3dj4lz,DieGodDie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:54:39 2015 UTC,"What type of evidence would convince you that a religion is legit?   Nothing. I really don't think I could ever believe that the creator of the universe wants to control the way I live my life and decided to provide ""guidance"" to me via a book and the rabid antics of some cretins. And this, millions of years after humanity had come into existence, building it self up from nothing to create civilisations, to master lands and build great palaces and cities.  There is no point in religion unless it is of the mythological, philosophical and contemplative kind (dharmic religions, pagan beliefs etc.). I have never felt the need for nor the use for this ""God"", nor have I ever seen anything within Islam to indicate that it is in anyway fit for a human being to embrace.  Thinking logically, there is nothing that a being could do, to prove that it is God, because you/I/we are/am human and cannot in anyway grasp omnipotence or omniscience or omnipresence, the qualities we most expect of a God.  If we are not capable of measuring the capacity of this being, then we cannot say that it is God, merely that it could be God. And if one such being, beyond our capacity to understand, exists, then there is no reason to suppose that others could not exist. Indeed, if God exists, who made him? Never got a good answer to that question.  So I don't think you could ever convince me of the legitimacy of a religion, in the sense of it being the word of God (pantheistic/dharmic stuff ... that's a different matter)."

I'm sure God would know what it would take. And it's more than some book written in a language spoken in one small country that contains so many errors, mistakes and immoral teachings.

In addition, since I was raised with strict morals, the personal integrity element has been tremendously helpful in gaining peer respect and professional success. Although I did miss out on a lot of fun that I could have had along the way and didn't due to the fear of the afterlife! It would be hard for me to GUESS whether this could have been achieved in a non-Muslim household or not! Simply no way to compare!  I suspect this answer wont' meet your expectations. However, I wanted to just state my opinion! However, if you think of Mo's Islam as a creed to help him a develop a clan of warriors, then it's militaristic style of training (5x prayers, 30x fasts, etc.) does make you better able to cope with hardships and adversity!"

I get bothered now anytime I'm with friends and they constantly bitch about being hungry as if it's the end of the world.   Just to add on, it bothers me a lot when people on this sub always go on and on about how their parents force them to pray, or force them to go to the mosque, or force them to do things we didn't want them to do. News flash, that's every parent ever, regardless of religion. They make you do things you don't want to do. I didn't wan an go to school either when i was younger, but hey, i fucking had to."

Although, I do not fast anymore.  The negative side of growing up in Islam: I have learned how to live a double life with my parents. I've learned all the tricks to jump around the very notion that I have left the faith. As a human being outside of my home, I do not like to lie that much. I try to avoid it as much as possible. Why lie to people in the real world? That is where you are going to find your real friends who like you for you.   It makes me emotional knowing that I can never really have a true connection with my family. My parents pretty much said they will die if anyone says they have left Islam. What kind of fucking psychological torture is that? It's abuse.   My identity isn't Muslim. I am a child of Islam. Nothing more. I am a person who has read the Quran objectively and can no long accept what is in the book.   I did my duty mom and dad. You guys told me to read the Quran and discover it. Well, I did guys. I discovered how wrong it is, and how it is pretty much a work of fiction.   One day, I might be strong enough to tell my parents.

exmuslim,3dj0j0,Faith-Breaker,2,Thu Jul 16 17:56:03 2015 UTC,i think leaving islam made me a better person. social events dont seem so akward anymore. i remember the day i left the religion. it felt like i was free from something. a feeling of not having any boundaries and doing what the hell i want to do for once. im also more tolerant as a person.  the down side of leaving islam is the fact that i feel my whole family (except my brouther) are all muslim psychopaths.

Second of all I suck at socializing with the opposite gender and I have no idea how I will deal with that in the real world when I move out. Lastly the thing about the afterlife being more important than this life and that the ultimate meaning to life is to worship allah has ruined me badly because my entire life I've lived not caring much about my life I just believed that I will just live this life,get married,die,and go to heaven.Each time I went through an inconvenience in life I always felt comforted over the fact that it won't matter anymore when I reach heaven,so when I lost my faith I started to feel very suicidal because when I was a muslim the meaning of life to me was to worship allah so when I left islam I felt like I've lost my reason to live and just having to live a double life was too hard on me I really hated lying and I just wanted to live my life the way I want to,not the way my parents want me to,I really want to be the person that I want to be,not the person that my parents want me to be. I'm currently recovering from this shitstorm I've somehow learned to cope with it,I'm not suicidal anymore because I just don't care if life has a meaning or not,I just want to live for the sake of living life. The fact that I have to live a double life depresses me at times but I feel comforted when I remember that I will escape this hellish present one day to be able to live a heavenly future."

Then I looked at myself and my own, very English mode of expression and being. It's a culture. When you're like me, the son of immigrants to Britain, you absorb and adapt. It's the healthy thing to do.  When you're a dumb fuck Bangladeshi in Bangladesh and you ape archaic Arab mannerisms and send your children to madrassa etc ... Then you're just communicating how seriously lacking your nation is in cultural richness and strength. Bengalis have a rich and proud heritage, it's just that it's all Hindu. As it should be, they are an off-shoot of Hindu people, who were taught their language by Buddhists (another off-shoot of Hinduism).  Most desi Muslims are the same, they're desperately poor in terms of culture and heritage and authenticity, because they submitted to the Muslimisation process, probably to get out of the Caste system, without thinking to develop their own cultural form of being Islamic.  So now, in an era when we meet Arabs and we see other cultures quite a lot, desi Muslims look and sound embarrassing, like an army of Muslim Mini Mes.  Short of stature and inauthentic, without purpose to their continued Islamification other than to show that they are not Hindu. Which they are not, any longer, because they have no culture not even Arab culture, they have the remembrance of something that itself was perverted and distorted from an original Arabic culture.  They will die, their children will die, the futility will kick start a change in their grand children and whatever remains from this great misadventure, will return to conformity at some point in the future."

In general, this is worse than the former, because the man imposes a more backwards culture on the wife and adds to the general immigration problem, whilst at least in the former, the man knows what he's doing and where he stands in the scheme of things.

exmuslim,3dgmsb,maxheart,5,Fri Jul 17 09:36:39 2015 UTC,"I might be able to help you with understanding him a bit better.   1) He is fasting. He absolutely refuses to eat... this also means his breath smells absolutely PUTRID. I cant even talk to him straight on, its that bad. Of course no gum either because that ruins the fast too.   When it comes to ritual, Muslims are very staunch, very extreme. Once you reach puberty, you MUST fast and you MUST fast properly. The only exceptions are for a woman having her period, or your health is so poor that it would be harmful. You might say: ""Why doesn't this guy eat?"". It's a line Muslims wouldn't even think of crossing. Not fasting is not like skipping Church, it's up there with the major sins. So that's how he sees it.  As for breath: a lot of Muslims think you can't even brush your teeth while fasting. This used to disgust me at school and varsity. Back when I used to fast, I used to brush my teeth and use mouthwash. Never saw what the big deal was.    2) I am younger than him and sometimes on long drives and the topic of religion comes up he will occasionally, not always, but sometimes if he feels the time is right slip in some sort of notion that I should join his clan. This is so creepy...   It is creepy, but Islam is a proselytizing religion. Many interpretations of the Quran and Hadith emphasize the importance of bringing new people into the faith. They actually call joiners 'reverts' instead of 'converts'. They claim people are born Muslim and are now 'reverting' back to the true way. Ask him about it.  Muslims are convinced that Islam is the right way, and the only way. A priori, he considers you deceived and incorrect about your religious position no matter what it might be. This is why many Muslims look down upon non-Muslims and find it hard to get along with them. They literally think that you are a wrong and need to see things their way, even the moderate ones.  Most of them can keep their proselytization to themselves (they call it Da'wah), but if you show even the mildest interest in their religion, most will try and invite you in. They think they're doing you a favour. On the flip side, they'll never be interested (and they'll likely be offended) if you try to proselytize them.   3) He thinks that cousin marriage is fine... Even said he would be fine with arranging the marriage of his kid to the kid of a sibling. Creeped me out again.   How creepy it is depends on your culture. In many cultures around the world, it is acceptable to marry one's first cousins or second cousins. I personally know of many happily married first and second cousins with normal children. It wasn't and isn't that weird if your culture accepts it.  Especially in Indian cultures, there is a huge importance placed on family and on marrying into a 'good family'. When someone is marrying a relative, they usually know in advance how 'good' the family is.   4) On another occasion of religious talks I asked about Salman Rushdie as I was curious and that was a hot topic in islam years ago. He said he should be killed and he would do it if he had the chance. Also thinks that ex-muslims should be punished but didnt say how.   This I HATE. Most Muslims think that Muhammad was the most perfect sublime entity ever to have existed ever and could possibly exist and you should do everything that he says and does because he is the best ever OMG! They literally call him a 'mercy to creation'. One of the first things Ex-Muslims find out when we leave Islam is that Muhammad was actually kind of a prick (very different to what we were taught).  But bearing in mind the almost God-like status of Muhammad in Islam, most Muslims (even moderate ones) will start frothing at the mouth if you criticize him. Try it sometime and see what happens. Mention that you aren't a fan of Muhammad's violent wars or that he married 9 wives while allowing his followers only 4. Watch him lose him lose his marbles if you're brave enough to ask that.   I actually read the Satanic Verses and liked it. I thought it was a good thing for literature that the book was written (it wasn't amazing, it was pretty good). Most Muslims haven't read it however, just like they haven't even read the Quran.  Hope that helps"
exmuslim,3dgmsb,CadmeusCain,3,Thu Jul 16 11:38:59 2015 UTC,"Most Muslims would know of the bad shit Mohammed did, right? I think it is just that they have two standards: one for the perfect prophet who was chosen by God, and another standard for everyone else. Once they apply the normal standard to the prophet he suddenly doesn't look so good anymore."

exmuslim,3dgmsb,crashbundicoot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:44:04 2015 UTC,Aha. Since it's second cousins the relationship is more distant. I know genetic stuff gets tough when it's first cousins.  Some US states restrict first cousin marriages and some make such relations illegal.
exmuslim,3dgmsb,lumloon,2,Thu Jul 16 07:47:06 2015 UTC,The risk even among first cousin marriages is often exaggerated. The risk however increases a lot when there's continuous inbreeding for two or more generations.

exmuslim,3dhm2x,CadmeusCain,2,Thu Jul 16 09:56:36 2015 UTC,"So a while ago, I was searching around Reddit and this thread came up with many of Warraq's books available for free. I started reading Why I Am Not A  Muslim on my Kindle shortly after.  This thread should totally be stickied or included in the FAQ or something. These books are really popular with ex-Mooses wanting to be introduced to the broad arguments against Islam. The problem is that they tend to be expensive (at least where I'm from).   Thumbs up to u/hexag1 for originally sharing these. You are an ex-Moose hero!"

Warraq grew up in Karachi, and went to boarding school in England.   His books are regarded by serious academic scholars of Islam as valuable volumes of serious research.  Warraq has recently put up a website at:  www.IbnWarraq.com  What's great about Warraq is that he is scathingly critical of Islam, while at the same time being from a Muslim family and society, and so his criticism cannot be dismissed as bigotry."
exmuslim,3dhm2x,hexag1,2,Thu Jul 16 11:14:18 2015 UTC,"Not only is his scholarship of a high level, he is also from and Indian-Pakistani Muslim family. Warraq grew up in Karachi, and went to boarding school in England. His books are regarded by serious academic scholars of Islam as valuable volumes of serious research.   So far I'm only on the 3rd chapter of his main book. I'm finding that when he does his research it's usually from strong sources and a good understanding of the underlying material. However, for many topics he seems to just scrape the surface. I guess he has to keep the book under 1 million pages (you could write a whole chapter on just the Mary/Meriam confusion alone).   So far I'm enjoying it however! I'll provide more commentary when I'm done.   What's great about Warraq is that he is scathingly critical of Islam, while at the same time being from a Muslim family and society, and so his criticism cannot be dismissed as bigotry.   Guy definitely understands Islam and his arguments demand counter-arguments rather than dismissal. Whether or not I think he's a great author or not I'm still deciding. I found the first chapter of Why I Am Not a Muslim to be more polemical than informative. It's gotten better since then."
exmuslim,3dhm2x,hexag1,2,Thu Jul 16 11:23:41 2015 UTC,"But he isn't actually a scholar and no one actually appreciates his work as scholarship.  Most of his books aren't even original scholarship.  They're just collections of discredited orientalists.    I have a bunch of reviews on my computer by actual scholars criticizing him and his books.   This is from the Middle East Journal by As'ad AbuKhalil:   Ibn Warraq is on a mission to ""expose"" and attack the dangers of Islam. For his efforts, he, like Lewis, received an invitation to the White House to meet with high-ranking officials. Ibn Warraq probably takes his name from the courageous free thinker in classical Islam, Abu 'Isa Muhammad bin Harun bin Muhammad al-Warraq. But unlike the present-day Ibn Warraq, Abu 'Isa was a courageous freethinker who wrote refutations of more than one religion. Ibn Warraq claims to subscribe to secularism and freethinking, yet he objects to Islam only and aligns himself with Christian fundamentalism, which raises questions about the true thrust of his mission. Free thinking, in any religion and against all religions, should be encouraged although there is a difference between religious bigotry and enlightened freethinking. The latest two books by Ibn Warraq merely collect old writings by classical Orientalists.  The more rigid and biased the Orientalists, the better for Warraq. Warraq himself has  nothing original to say on the subject; he merely resuscitates the writings of those Orientalists who have been long discredited, such as Henri Lammens and Ernest Renan, among other less discredited Orientalists. Warraq rejects mainstream Orientalists, like W.M. Watt. He quotes Renan's famous Islam et la Science lecture approvingly: ""To liberate the Muslim from his religion is the best service that one can render him."" It is now acceptable to express such views in polite company.   Asma Afsaruddi on his book on Muhammad.   The editor is clearly courting controversy by indulging in a selfserving, polarizing discourse in his lengthy introduction, which sets the tone for the rest of the book.   Herbert Berg on his book on the Origins of the Qur'an.   It seems that Ibn Warraq has included some of the essays not on the basis of their scholarly value or their status as 'classics', but rather on the basis of their hostility to Islam. This does not necessarily diminish the value of the collection, but the reader should be aware that this collection does not fully represent classic scholarship on the Quran.   I have two negative reviews of him from François de Blois.    Here's a funny one from Todd Lawson on his book on the Qur'an.   It must be said that it undoubtedly demonstrates the editor's diligence and industry in finding churlish things to say about the Qur'an in English. It is difficult to recommend this production, except perhaps for antiquarian interests and the archaeology of the study of Islam.    Here's my favorite part about the origins of the Qur'an book.  The Arabic on the cover is printed upside down.  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/16/OriginsOfTheKoran.jpg  There is no legitimate scholar in the world who would dabble in polemical works against Islam (Why I am not a Muslim and Leaving Islam), but also write fair scholarship while under a pseudonym. These are just not academic practices."
exmuslim,3dhm2x,Atheizm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:44:30 2015 UTC,"I have heard many times that his essays The Origins of the Koran are pretty terrible. On the other hand, many of the criticisms he brings up in Why I am not a Muslim so far I'm familiar with and can be verified. The first chapter was indulgent self-serving polemic, that I'll agree.  I'll reserve judgment till I finish his book. I'm glad he wrote it though. Islam is certainly too much of a sacred cow at present. Few Western Scholars are prepared to go after it in the same way that they've analyzed the Bible. As someone who's studied much of it myself, I can say that it is true that many Western Scholars take much of the Islam history at face value when they really should be more skeptical about what is highly dodgy material, filled with fabrications and inaccuracy."

Islam came down to guide and improve humanity's morality-it banned polytheism straight away and caused an uproar and a collapse of pre-islamic meccan society towards islam - ""polytheism"" by the way is nowhere near as inhumane, cruel, and reprehensible as ""slavery""..

We have the power of the internets to combine forces!  If you don't know about the Jefferson, this will give you an idea!   Jefferson produced the 84-page volume in 1820—six years before he died at age 83—bound it in red leather and titled it The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth. He had pored over six copies of the New Testament, in Greek, Latin, French and King James English. “He had a classic education at [the College of] William & Mary,” Rubenstein says, “so he could compare the different translations. He cut out passages with some sort of very sharp blade and, using blank paper, glued down lines from each of the Gospels in four columns, Greek and Latin on one side of the pages, and French and English on the other.”  Much of the material Jefferson elected to not include related miraculous events, such as the feeding of the multitudes with only two fish and five loaves of barley bread; he eschewed anything that he perceived as “contrary to reason.” His idiosyncratic gospel concludes with Christ’s entombment but omits his resurrection. He kept Jesus’ own teachings, such as the Beatitude, “Blessed are the peace-makers: for they shall be called the children of God.” The Jefferson Bible, as it’s known, is “scripture by subtraction,” writes Stephen Prothero, a professor of religion at Boston University.

If God exists, he would give a personal revelation to EVERY one who he expected that they should obey him and be afraid of Hell.  That is the least he should do. I mean, any rational God cannot expect a human being to be afraid of Hell when that God didnt even talk to him personally.  You would not take a debt collector seriously if that debt collector sent you cryptic messages. You want that person to try his best to contact you in person, phone call, whatever it is.  If a debt collector can make a phone call, God, the all-powerful can definitely make multiple personal revelations to every single person he is targeting and create amazing magic shows that everyone would record on Youtube for others to see.   Anyway...... Islam is all fairy tales. None of it is true.  There is no Hell, no Heaven. Evolution is true.  Evolution hu Akbar."
exmuslim,3dg9m8,Shirinator,7,Thu Jul 16 02:23:18 2015 UTC,Also if Christianity is true all Muslims are going to hell for rejecting Jesus as their saviour. I mean it's just all so weird.    Mostly religion is due to whatever geographical location you happen to come from.

exmuslim,3dg9m8,UnkelFesterAddams,6,Thu Jul 16 22:41:36 2015 UTC,"Ask yourself this question: Are you afraid of going to Christian Hell or Vicking Hell or Jewish Hell or Greek Hell or any of the 2500 known gods out there version of hell? No? Of course not because you know Religions are man made and since humanity started about 200.000 years ago not a single god was shown to exist but ALL of them were shown to have been invented by man. This is why religion relies on faith and not on facts. Islam is probably the worst after Mormonism for plagiarizing the Christian and Jewish texts.  Also ask yourself why is Islam strong in countries with low education and virtually zero Nobel prizes? Because it fits with an uneducated population that does not know better. Finally ask yourself why an entity capable of doing all this would chose someone who was illiterate in the 7th century instead of waiting for the 21st century to show itself to the world...at a time where we embrace science and reason but instead preferred to reveal itself to an illiterate person for 23 years in a remote part of the world in a cave...instead of going to the Chinese or even the Egyptians? This entity having the control of time and space, why do you think it would pick the 7th century and that particular person and ONLY be interested in making people worship that entity 5 times a day and pray in a certain direction and ban them from masturbating because if there is something that an entity that control the universe thinks about...its why humans masturbate and why they have sex with mixed genders and what they eat and what foot they put forward to enter the bathroom etc...  Then think why that entity let 99.9% of all species it created on that single planet be extinct and why it created viruses, worms, bacterias, fungi and other nasty things whose only purpose is to kill humans? And finally how come that entity thinks it can create all life from water (H2O) which in only 2 elements on the periodic table? Does it sounds more like someone making things up with their knowledge of the world in the 7th century or the entity that created everything and knows everything?   So why should you be worried about a punishment concept that was invented in the Bronze Age as a mean to control people by fear?"

exmuslim,3dg9m8,blablahfish,2,Fri Jul 17 07:53:20 2015 UTC,"Imam Hussain died in Karbala fighting against injustice; he let himself and his family get destroyed but would not back down against a despotic dictator. Based on the same principle, I would rather go to hell than back down from my beliefs, which by the way are not chosen by a person, but just form in one's mind due to no choice of their own.  You are either exposed to evidence, reasoning, feelings, etc that convince you of something, or you are not fortunate enough for those things and are not convinced. When you happen to be convinced, it is called a belief. It is not a choice, contrary to what Muslims would have you think. Come to think of it, whether you are an ex-muslim or not is not in your control anyway. Also, it's not like a binary, yes-or-no thing; there's a lot of grey area between being Muslim and being ex-Muslim.  Rather than lying to myself about what I am or am not convinced by, I would rather stand up against this being called a god, which shows unjust traits by putting people into eternal hell because they had the misfortune of having an open and critical, skeptical mind and happened to have been exposed to the 'wrong' things (like reason, science, evidence, etc).  Lastly, there was a video of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Majid Nawaaz, and Imam Abdur Rauf, where Imam Abdur Rauf said that according to one of the highest Shi'ite authorities alive, if a person was to genuinely deep down be true to their conscience, then they are a Muslim even if they apostatize. That probably means that most of us claiming to be ex-Muslim are still spiritually Muslims."
exmuslim,3dg9m8,utnahpishtim,2,Thu Jul 16 01:57:36 2015 UTC,"Well you've got two questions here.   Am I afraid of being wrong? Am I afraid of going to Hell?   So am I afraid of being wrong? Yes, definitely. I live with the knowledge that I could be wrong about anything and, likely, right now I am wrong about many things. I will likely die having been wrong about so many things. Part of this stems from an honest application of Skepticism: to be a true skeptic, one must also be skeptical of skepticism; i.e. that other methods of appraising truth might provide more powerful answers. I'm ok with this. I accept my fallibility and try to keep learning. If ever I find out I was wrong about something, I'd like to be able to throw the wrong thing away and replace it with something more correct.  Could I be wrong about God? Sure. Maybe there is a Creator God, or a Pantheon of many Gods. Maybe there is a life after death. I don't know. An honest application of the evidence leads me to conclude that there isn't a God, at least there isn't a God as described by most major religions. To me the evidence is just too strong to ignore. In fact, I'm pretty sure that the God described in most major religions, especially the one in the Abrahamic religions, is a ridiculous and disturbing fictional character. I think if there is a God, it would be beyond the comprehension of human understanding; in which case there might not be any point trying to understand it. Simply: the God described in most religions makes no impact in my life so there isn't a good reason to even think about one.  Am I scared of going to Hell? To be honest, not at all. I don't think Hell is a real place. I think it was first made by Christianity having stolen concepts from Greek religion and other myths. It was then stolen by Islam. It appears nowhere in Judaism. I think Hell is quite obviously a cheap way of threatening people to get them to do what you want. The idea of it is so patently absurd that no thinking person or God could ever think this was a good idea. Punishing someone infinitely with fire for something they did wrong? It's ludicrous! How petty is this God that something you did offended him enough that it wants to get back at you? Why would it even care? Also: the idea of infinite punishment for a finite crime, especially given the circumstances of so many peoples' lives is plain madness. It gets even worse when you suppose that this God already knows everything in advance.  There's also something called the Atheist Wager. And I think of it like this. If there is a God, I'd like him to know that I tried to live as honest and moral a life as reasonably possible. I studied as many religions as my time allowed, I studied them deeply and thought about them critically. In doing so, I couldn't honestly bring myself to believe any of them. So I didn't. Surely if this God was all-knowing, they would understand that; and the would understand why it was impossible for me to believe.  If after this: they STILL want to punish me... well fuck them; they're evil and I wouldn't want to worship them anyway."
exmuslim,3dg9m8,ontrack,2,Thu Jul 16 10:14:56 2015 UTC,"(not an ex-Muslim, but had Christian influences in my childhood, so I am familiar with the fear of hell)  Just think about what the implications of hell being real would be. If you do, you'll soon find out that the concept of going to hell for disobeying is downright absurd.   If hell is real and people get sent to hell for disobeying God, then why do people do good? Do people do good because they are good and believe in doing good, or do they good because they wish to be rewarded for it? And if they only do good in the hope of being rewarded, then they motives aren't really pure, are they? Surely God would be more interested in people who are good out of conviction, rather than out of a hope to get something out of it?  Isn't the whole concept of divine judgement rather corrupt? People trying to bribe God with good deeds? Doesn't that make the whole religion corrupt? Why do we follow God's law anyway? Is it because he punishes us if we don't? Isn't that the hallmark of tyranny? Obey me or suffer? Does that make God a tyrant? Why does God need us to obey him? Why did he create humanity with free will only to demand that they surrender free will and worship Him as slaves? Isn't that rather narcissistic? Creating a whole species just to get somebody to worship Gim? Does our non-believe influence God in some way? Is He so insecure that he cannot stand the thought that there is somebody out there who doesn't love Him? Is He so controlling that He can't stand the thought that somebody wouldn't completely submit to Him? Why does God need hell anyway? Surely God, being almighty, can come up with a better way to get people to follow His commands than promising eternal torture? Is He really God if He can't? Why does God need eternal punishment anyway? Surely He could get His revenge in far less time than that? Why exactly does the punishment need to be the most horrendous torture you can think of? Surely God could find a different punishment? Does God enjoy inflicting suffering? Is God a sadist? Isn't it rather hilarious that people call such a God merciful and forgiving? While at the same time everybody is desperately hoping to not be subject to His wrath? Isn't the fact that you need to remind yourself continuously of His mercy and forgiveness an indication that He really is neither merciful nor forgiving? The Quran teaches us that it is God who causes disbelieve and causes people to err. So why would He punish other people for something He did? Why does God punish people for something they have no control over? Is that really justice? Why exactly is disobeying God wrong? Because He created us? Why does that give Him the right to punish us? Didn't He create us with free will? Surely His intend would be to use our free will. So why would He punish us for doing what He intended? What is the basis for God's law? If it is morality, then where does God get His morality from? If it isn't morality, then what is it? Is there any? Is it simply His will? Does right and wrong still exist if God's law is nothing but His will?  If God's law are just His will, and He can will anything at any time without reason, doesn't that make them rather arbitrary? Can arbitrary laws be just? If God is arbitrary, can He then still be called just?   So what exactly is God if hell exists? An insecure 5 year old who desperately needs attention or He'll throw a temper tantrum? Or a sadistic, narcissistic, tyrant? Surely, that can't be true right? So if that can't be true, then how can hell exist?

I just can’t see a higher being creating this innocent child and then letting it grow up, die, and then proceeding to torture it for eternity. Why? Because this individual used their reasoning skills to examine an ideology objectively and came to the conclusion that this particular ideology made little sense?  Or worse because they happened to be born in a family which adhered to a different ideology and this child’s brain did what it was designed to do, learn from and follow it’s care takers.   It seems to be such a “human” thing to do. There is indeed a sadistic and sickening aspect to human nature, an animal may kill a fellow species member but it will never systematically torture it. Only humans seem to engage in such behavior ,  often in the name of their God/Religion.  However as a species there has been a paradigm shift in our collective consciousness in that we recognized that such behavior is wrong.

But apparently the entity who created the universe told his prophet that it made all life from water...which is either a lie or a mistake, two things Allah is apparently incapable of doing  Then one must ask the question why didn t the entity that created the universe tell his chosen prophet about evolution when it is the basic staple for explaining the diversity of life?

exmuslim,3dg7jl,UnkelFesterAddams,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:29:03 2015 UTC,"I have a bit of a contrarian view on this. My view is that Islam says nothing about evolution; it could not have since evolution was not a known scientific fact back then, so it wasn't something on which it was even possible to comment on. Instead, what it does is tell us the myth of Adam and Eve, and by myth I do not mean it in the dismissive sense of the word; by myth I mean something like the myth of 'the boy who cried wolf'. It doesn't matter if such a boy actually existed or not (probably didn't); the point of the myth is a story that gives us a message.  So, Sufi type, deep-meaning folks have generally not (to my knowledge) claimed that Adam and Eve were literally the first homo sapiens, but rather refer to certain aspects of humanity, etc etc. It is the theologians, the literalists, followed by the - unfortunately illiterate, uneducated and frankly uncritical and simple-minded - masses, that made idiotic claims like oh this is how humans came about ta-da."

exmuslim,3dg7jl,CrackaBox,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:29:11 2015 UTC,"Below I'll also talk about the big bang.  Creationist reading: They usually point to the fact that the quran is a fully detailed(41:3) clear book(11:1). The creation myth is the same 6 day creation with no details regarding what happened each day. The quran also tells the same story of Adam and Eve who were created from earth/soil/dust and lived in heaven before falling to earth, with no mention of anything like evolution. There was a beginning which could have been the big bang, also the quran doesn't detail ages and times so the world could be older than 6000 years, also the earth the heavens and the stars were one entity before the beginning(21:30).  Allegorical reading: Some stories in the quran are allegorical to teach something greater(they usually point to 3:7). They are meant to teach a higher truth.  Dawah reading: Usually points to 71:14, which says allah made man in stages. That verse was usually interpreted as embryology. The 6 day creation myth is also misread where the word used as days are not 6 24 hour days but 6 stages. They usually point to verses 22:47 and 32:5 that say a day for allah is a 1,000 years and in 70:4 it's 50,00, so some interpret this that a day for allah is just a stage with an arbitrary length. They also point to 21:30 to prove that the big bang is taught in the quran(cleft assunder is interpreted as stretching apart). The problem with this argument is that it implies that for centuries no one knew the true meaning of this verse until coincidentally someone proved it.  Scholars: You will find a lot of nuance on their stance of evolution, but most who accept evolution don't agree that the quran explains it and are closer to ideas that stories in the quran are life lesson rather than facts, that adam and eve being made from dirt symbolizes the humility of humans in the sight of god, and that the earth separating from heaven symbolizes holy space and unholy space. The quran is not a book of science and signs, and saying otherwise is intellectual dishonesty."

He is a human being but created from light like angels, rather than from clay like other human beings.[29] He is present in many places at the same time.[30] He is still witnessing all that goes on in the world.[30] He has knowledge of that which is unknown, including the future.[31] He has God's authority to do whatever he desires.[32]   Therefore, what I am saying is that in order to prove Islam as divine Muslims will contradict themselves. Agreeably, Barelvi's are limited to India/Pakistan/Bangladesh, however, they are the dominant sunni subsect. Since in Sunni Islam there is NO single narrative nor doctrinal authority therefore, every sect, subsect has its own narrative and one of the reasons I left Islam was that it's subject to the interpretation of your local neighborhood sheikh based on the day of the week and the week of the year!"

Classical tafsir have a little story that they tie to it which may or may not be correct. As for why someone would reprimand themselves, as far as reprimands go this is as light as you can get. It sounds like more of a reminder.   We're caught in position of heavy speculation regarding what was going through muhammads head if he was talking about himself (or what he's talking about if he wasn't). I mean, it's possible he felt bad and gave a reminder to himself that he could have handled the situation better and what to do in the future. As you said muhammad was trying to convert people and shoed someone away asking for guidance. That kind of behavior is at odds so maybe some humility was felt soon thereafter.    Why would an upstart cult leader undermine his own position of power and authority by dwelling on his mistakes?   Muhammad's power was not predicated off his own authority but off of the authority of god. The more people think he's inspired by god and that his words come from other than himself, the better. Based off of your questioning, you seem to think that if he was just a cult leader he would have never made these verses thus the article 'ten reasons why muhammad couldn't have authored the quran'. Perhaps that's what he wanted people to think? Or perhaps what I said above, or perhaps both or some other explanation. Regardless, this event doesn't really prove anything as it requires too much speculation of what did or did not happen / what muhammad would or would not have done / and why or why not he would have done so."

All the sources that tell us what a 'barbaric' wasteland Arabia before Muhammad got there are from Muslim Islamic sources. Unfortunately the Pagans aren't around to tell us whether or not they were nice people because Muhammad conquered them, killed a bunch of them and destroyed their religion.  If you actually go read some arguments by critical secular scholars (not Montgomery Watt who was quite clearly pro-Islam, believes that Muhammad was prophet and approached the histories with the same skepticism as a child watching Dragon Ball Z) then a very different picture emerges. It seems rather that pre-Islamic Arabia was a diverse region from a religious and cultural perspective but, like any society, was flawed. How flawed was it? We may never know because the winners wrote the history and made the Pagans look like devils! Muhammad came in, fixed some problems and created others. Did he advance the culture? In many aspects yes. Did he unite the warring tribes: yes. Did he cause a lot of bloodshed and lasting damage to achieve that: definite yes!  To list just a few of the disgusting things this man did (not in his moral life, in his political life) that harmed so many people:   Massacred the entire clan of Banu Qurayza including killing all their men and selling the women and children into slavery Murdered all rival prophets, like Musaylamah, as well as killed anyone who spoke out against him Ordered the killing of Apostates, or anyone who left the religion, Caused huge dissent in Makkah by attacking Pagan religion and turning families and tribes against each other Attacked and robbed many of the Quraysh's caravans (this actually led to the battle of Badr) Led many violent conquests against other tribes and peoples, such as the Battle of Khaybar where they attacked and destroyed a Jewish settlement. Created many 'revelations' that personally benefited him, but ended up harming other people. Such as abolishing adoption so that he could marry his adopted son's ex-Wife who he was lusting after   I deny that he was a 'good person'. He did some good things, and many bad things. He was a social reformer but also a warlord who caused a great deal of bloodshed. The benefits to him were obvious. By the time his conquest was over, he was the most powerful man in Arabia with a tribe of followers who would follow his every word as Holy Law. He certainly abused his power as well, amassing a harem of beautiful women for his own personal enjoyment (when he only allowed his followers to have 4). Guy was most likely a lunatic.  Also: I don't think that he was 'honest'. By any account. A critical examination of the Quran reveals so many mistakes, errors, contradictions and flaws that no God could possibly have written it. It's mostly a rehash of stories from the Torah and Midrash material with Arab fables and superstition thrown in. When it came to Christianity Muhammad was so inept that he confused Miriam for Mary, and thought that the Trinity consisted of God, Jesus and Mary.   The really shocking part is that gullible people like you really think this power-hungry merchant living in 600CE Arabia, who was an appalling moral example by the way, was speaking on behalf of God. When one actually studies Muhammad and his life it is actually demeaning to human intelligence that people can believe this trite crap. Even Joseph Smith has a better argument than Muhammad and I'd sooner believe that Pokemon are real than believe him.  EDIT: If you really think we came to be ex-Muslims because we wanted 'the Dunya' you're in for a shock. Most of us here have read the Quran, studied Islam, studied the Hadith and studied Muhammad's life in quite some detail.

I suppose the fact that we don't agree about that the Quran is the word of God and that the Prophet Muhammed (SAW) was a true Prophet means that we can never see eye to eye even on this   I'm unsatisfied with the Islamic explanations. They require me to make leaps of faith. I'm unconvinced that Muhammad is a prophet. I'm unconvinced that anyone is a prophet. And I'm unconvinced the Quran is the word of God. I actually think there's an argument to be made that Muhammad is a terrible moral character and the Quran is a terrible moral guidance. Read the Analects of Confucius. Confucius was kinder and more benevolent than Muhammad and Jesus thousands of years before them. The Quran also contains errors that can't be honestly explained away without appealing to ambiguity or bs narratives.    I....highly doubt that. I've memorized the entire Quran (learning it with translation most of the time), read much of the Seerah etc. I'll admit that all my sources of Islamic knowledge for this are Islamic sources.   I've read much of the Islamic sources and consider them propaganda. The Seerah contains many fairytales like that Muhammad's heart was washed or that he flew up to heaven on a magic pony (The Miraaj is a later fabrication by the way). If you actually study where the Hadith and Biographies come from you'll be disappointed. The earliest sources are from around 200 years after Muhammad's death. Ibn Ishaq wrote a history 120 years after but it was lost. It only exists second hand as quoted in other histories. No contemporary sources exist whatsoever. It's highly likely that much of the history is fictional. Rather Ignaz Goldziher and others demonstrated that this is exactly the case.  Maybe read some secular sources. Even Reza Aslan isn't bad even though he's a self proclaimed Muslim apologist. Try No God But God by him."
exmuslim,3djp68,CadmeusCain,2,Thu Jul 16 21:42:17 2015 UTC,"I can see better where you come from now.   Even Reza Aslan isn't bad even though he's a self proclaimed Muslim apologist. Try No God But God by him.   Reza Aslan claims to be a Muslim but blatantly rejects parts of the Quran as being false. He doesn't even try to 'reinterpret' them; he just flat out says the Quran is wrong. I'm not sure how he is able to reconcile his belief if he picks and chooses so blatantly. Not even Quranists who reject a huge part of Islam can reject the Quran.  If part of the Quran is wrong then is the word of Allah, is the rest correct. I can hardly consider him a Muslim.  Even non-Muslims cannot consider him an authentic source. I'd probably go for another author with if I was going to refer to non-Islamic sources."

Certainly if you don't believe the Koran is the literal word of God but is instead Muhammeds tool to create a empire you actually appreciate the man far more.  To me he's similar to Ceaser or Genghis Khan one of the greats who did terrible things but contributed to the world in which historians call creative destruction.

I was inspired by the likes of anwar awlaki and some other jihadist from chechneya and read tons of matierial on jihad and Islamic warfare, I also during this phase distanced myself from the deobandi/tablighi version of Islam and moved towards a radical salafi version of islam.

I was still Muslim at this stage and took a gap year after matric to complete my memorisation of the Quran, it was during this year during my Quranic studies that I had seriously doubted Islam and began researching about fallacies in the Quran and hadith, and all the unethical actions of moe and especially his relationship with Ayesha was the final breaking point for me and that's when I had finally being liberated from Islam."

The epic of gilgamesh was written 1000 years before Genesis, The epic of Gilgamesh stole the story from the epic of Athra-Hasis which was written 500 years before The epic of Gilgamesh, and the epic of Astra-Hasis stole the same flood story from Ziusudra. Although we haven't found any older tablets telling the story we can definitely say the story plagiarized. Also it wasn't really based on any specific even, rather it was a way of explaining the nature of the gods of Mesopotamia. As Religion has shaped a region, the region shapes religion, and the region of Mesopotamia was in between two rivers(Tigris and Euphrates) which floods uncontrollably and unpredictably, and this produced gods who were uncontrollable and unpredictable. If in one year a city was destroyed by the rivers you would just think the gods were upset for whatever reason, and you would be reminded of the time gods flooded the world except one family and two of every animal because humans were partying too loud and disrupting their sleep."

All of those stories have similar outlines but they are not the same story. There could have been one big flood experienced by all the people in that region and could be interpreted differently in each ""tribe"". You also have to take it into consideration that not everything was written down in tablets but many laws, rules and stories were passed on ""orally"". Whether the floods have a religious connotation depends on who is reciting or using the flood stories in their holy books. The stories in the book of Genesis were transferred orally before they were written down. Then then there is also the probability that multiple floods took place in that region. There are around 256 flood stories around the world. Having read most of them, I can say that the common theme seems to be some angry deity and someone or some people being saved. Do people tend to interpret natural disasters as a religious revelation? Yes. Are all these 256 stories related to each other? Probably no."

The burden of proof is on the story tellers and they have brought no proof of it.   And yes we do know it was plagiarized because it's the same story, the only difference is that the character has a different name, he sent out an extra bird, and there were different god, but the whole story is exactly the same. In fact the Jewish writers only added the story during the Babylonian exile, the only time they had contact with those stories. Saying there is no proof of plagiarism is like me directing a movie entirely similar to star-wars with the exception of names and props, then telling everyone there's no proof that I plagiarized George Lucas."
exmuslim,3dezql,FemaleInfidel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:18:02 2015 UTC,"You have to also take it into consideration that a huge number of Jews were originally non-Jews who converted to Judaism. This means they descended from Mesopotamian local folk. Thus it is possible that they might recite a similar or the same flood. The Genesis was written sometime between 1440-1400 BC and the Babylonian exile took place in 539 BCE. Try reading/comparing multiple sources and avoid quoting from liberal Christian sources about the history of Genesis. What you've quoted is from liberal Christian sources.  There are lots of problems with that liberal Christian thesis as they state that the letter J was used as a reference to the first author with reference to Yahweh meaning the name of God according to Christians. However the Hebrew name of God is written with the letters Yud-Hey-Vav-Hey, in latin the letters YHWH- so there is no J in there. The Latin letter J is not the equivalent of the letter Yud (Y) of Hebrew. The second thesis with the second author of the Genesis being a Jewish priest is also flawed as the Jewish priests did not have the duty to record the law. Jewish priests do not function like the Christian priests. The theory of the third author is also flawed as there is absolutely no info given about this third author."

exmuslim,3dezql,FemaleInfidel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:26:12 2015 UTC,"Here is a Shamanic flood story from Buryat-Eastern Siberia. The god Burkhan advised a man to build a great ship, and the man worked on it in the forest for many long days, keeping his intention secret from his wife by telling her he was chopping wood. The devil, Shitkur, told the wife that her husband was building a boat and that it would be ready soon. He further told her to refuse to board and, when her husband strikes her in anger, to say, ""Why do you strike me, Shitkur?"" Because the woman followed this advise, the devil was able to accompany her when she boarded the boat. With the help of Burkhan, the man gathered specimens of all animals except Argalan-Zan, the Prince of animals (some say it was a mammoth), which considered itself too large to drown. The flood destroyed all animals left on earth, including the Prince of animals, whose bones can still be found. Once on the boat, the devil changed himself into a mouse and began gnawing holes in the hull, until Burkhan created a cat to catch it."

I'm not arguing that because it's a flood story it's plagiarized(practically every religion has one), I'm arguing that because it's the same flood story it's plagiarized.

Saudis Ironically are notorious of this, there are a lot of words that even I (as a Kuwaiti) don't understand because they're shortened, the religious side however hates this, this is why western Muslims keep saying these obnoxious ""ASSALAMU ALYKUM WA RAHMATULLAH WA BARAQATU"" or use the annoying arabic words that are honestly pointless, and confusing to anyone who isn't arabic (and even arabic to be honest because they pronounce them wrong)  but they think are cool for some reason.

Unless of course you're illiterate, you wouldn't understand anything anyways. Therefore you would not be able to read anything.  Pre-Islamic arabic, now that's the mind bender.

Other than that she doesn't agree with extremists, hates violence, like movies music etc..and she has lots of friends from other faiths.

I don't consume stuff that Muslims aren't allowed to consume in front of her, purely because I feel guilty that I'm consuming something that while I know she is tempted to consume, she is prohibited from. So I don't do it, unless she is joining me in doing so. I feel it is only common courtesy, despite her being okay with me eating stuff that's non-halal, I won't still do it in front of her.

The one thing I've made clear is that the kids aren't going to have any names with religious significance. The only thing we debate about, that I know I might be fighting  a losing battle, but at the same time when it happens might take a stand, is in regards to circumcision if we ever have a son. The pressure from her side of the family might be a lot at the time, but I don't know how I'll react if and when such a day comes. But other than that there's not many things we disagree on in regards to lifestyle choices. While I am not a Muslim, we both value the arts and pleasures of our culture equally. We love the movies, music, food and clothes of our own culture and make sure we enjoy them to the fullest without religion ever being an obstacle. She's fortunately very liberal in regards to stuff like that."

Trust me, to put up with someone ranting about your worldview takes a lot of courage, and if your wife can do that you guys shouldn't have any issues. No one likes having their views challenged - when I was leaving Islam I was quite depressed because I was losing my worldview and my identity.

It took a lot of fighting before we get here though. I think j mentioned in one of my earlier posts that my mother I law passed away( she was really devout). After her death my father in law lost it, went complete strict in religion, wrought his kids of their inheritance by applying shariah standard(and also used a hit of secular law to get some more too). He justified it to the whole community and they went with him because it's what Allah has mandated.

We're heading into a period of intense flux, no doubt about it. The natural survival instincts of all affected peoples will kick in, so a huge spike in right-ward, safety-first, emotional-coping (nostalgia, reactionary rhetoric) will probably be the dominant political spirit.  The Left's politics always bring destruction and a shift to The Right, which imposes discipline and order and builds up frustration, resentment and perversity (the way that frustration and resentment play out in the victimised to make them damaged and Radical Leftist). Then when all that constriction and repression (and strength and purpose) produce a period of wealth/security ... The Left explodes out, obliterating the ""obsolete"" and ""anti freedom"" Right ... Then they ruin everything and the process kicks in again, in a few generations.  That's basically what seems to be the way the R-L thing works.

One of the children of Israel hurt him by saying, 'He covers his body in this way only because of some defect in his skin, either leprosy or scrotal hernia, or he has some other defect.' Allah wished to clear Moses of what they said about him, so one day while Moses was in seclusion, he took off his clothes and put them on a stone and started taking a bath. When he had finished the bath, he moved towards his clothes so as to take them, but the stone took his clothes and fled; Moses picked up his stick and ran after the stone saying, 'O stone! Give me my garment!' Till he reached a group of Bani Israel who saw him naked then, and found him the best of what Allah had created, and Allah cleared him of what they had accused him of. The stone stopped there and Moses took and put his garment on and started hitting the stone with his stick. By Allah, the stone still has some traces of the hitting, three, four or five marks. This was what Allah refers to in His Saying:-- ""O you who believe! Be you not like those Who annoyed Moses, But Allah proved his innocence of that which they alleged, And he was honorable In Allah's Sight.""

exmuslim,3dg184,FooFoo94,4,Wed Jul 15 23:57:34 2015 UTC,www.quranx.com   Has all translations and context handy.
exmuslim,3dg184,boredg,2,Thu Jul 16 00:30:11 2015 UTC,"Translations of the quran are not as simple as just reading it. Arabic is a completely different language than English where sentences have words missing. For example: wallahi literally translates to ""and god"" but actually means ""and I swear to god"" so translators would write something like ""and [I swear to] god"" indicating the words that technically aren't there.   Also translations have their own interpretations, so be wary of what's inside the brackets. Sometimes a verse may have multiple interpretations so translators would use tafsirs and hadiths to isolate a desired meaning and add text that isn't there inside brackets. Example 1:7:   literal translation:The Way of those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace , not (the way) of those who earned Your Anger, nor of those who went astray.  Interpreted translation:The Way of those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace , not (the way) of those who earned Your Anger (such as the Jews), nor of those who went astray (such as the Christians).  Knowing that, I personally recommend Muhsin Khan, because he adds context to some verses which helps a lot in you're confused of what's going on, but he usually adds interpretations to and they are always sunni. Some people might recommend Sahih international. If you find a verse that stands out just go to quran.com which has multiple translations, in fact www.quran.com would probably be the best site for reading the www.quran since it even has it's own search engine. Also if you want an annotated text there's always the skeptics annotated quran which has the all standout verses pointed out.  Finally in which order of the quran you want to read? There's the standard longest to shortest, and there's the chronological order. So far there are two chronological orders(Egyptian standard and Noldeke's). The thing to note is that they are rough assemblies of chapters not verses, and the quran was authored in the span of 23 years in small units which were then assembled into chapters. So just because the overall chapter may come earlier doesn't mean all the verse came earlier. The Egyptian standard is based on hadiths and tafsirs, where as noldeke's is based on a more stylometric approach of noticing that earlier chapters have shorter verses. People usually read in chronological order to prove abrogation that Muhammad ordered that early peaceful verse were abrogated by later non-peaceful verses.  Also I could only find sunni translations and sunni interpretations, I have no idea how shias translate it."

I came up with this thought: Everything at one point was at a singularity. At some point-roughly 14 billion (13.7) years ago the big bang happen. Then, a bunch of gravity/relativity  and quantum mechanics and other sciency stuff happened and here we are 10 billion years later.   The definition of ""God"" in most religions-at least for sure the Abrahamic ones- say he is eternal and forever. Mathematically speaking, that means he had to wait an eternity to make the universe. Why did he wait so long? What was going on 20 billion  years ago that made God not wanting to make the universe. Why is the Quran only written for humans? What about aliens from different galaxies?   These thoughts alone should make people question the idea of ""god""."

exmuslim,3dcy0c,deslyfox,2,Wed Jul 15 18:51:13 2015 UTC,"No, they don't. Reading about the universe makes me question God so much.   The argument is that everything needs a creator, right? So it's like the logic they have is that they keep going to bigger and bigger objects (animals on earth, to the sun, to the galaxies to the universe) and they say that something has to have created all of this. So what do they do?:  They put a stopping point at ""God"" and say he did everything. With that logic you could stop and point at anything below that and ignore all larger objects of thinking. I honestly think it is their unwillingness to think outside the religion."

exmuslim,3dcy0c,EtriganZ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:08:51 2015 UTC,"There is this entity who made you just so that you could worship said entity. That entity created trillions upon trillions of planets and star and galaxies but is only interested in 1 of 1x1059 of its creation and virtually knows nothing about the rest of the universe. This entity cares about what you eat, who you sleep with, if you masturbate or what you consume as food and the direction in which you worship it. This entity also let 99.9% of all the species it created go extinct and purposefully created disease, bacterias, viruses and fungal infections to decimate its most intelligent species. That entity apparently also answers prayers but is unable to communicate directly with its own creations and must use intermediaries and pick remote uneducated and illiterate people in the worst times in its creation's history to spread its knowledge and wisdom. Knowing the future this entity knows very well that the 21st century would be a perfect time to show itself but instead prefers to wait for 150.000 years of its creation living in misery, disease and child death and show itself in the bronze age to uneducated and illitereate middle eastern desert sheep herders...instead of waiting for the 21st century and speak with the Nobel prize commission to name a few.  Nevermind the fact that this entity could have spoken during antiquity to the egyptians or the Chinese civilizations which already had print and were much advanced than a desert sheep herders of the middle east during the 7th century. Even the Romans would have been a better choice than someone with epilepsy who took 23 years to learn what he was told.  This entity also conveniently borrowed almost all its material from previous man-made religions including the names of the main figures and the numerous myths without knowing anything about physics and science. This entity also was confused about the earth not being flat and forgot that man lived to be 950 years old and could fly to a mythical place on a winged horse that this entity never created. That entity also forgot that its creation apparently could cut celestial bodies in half with a man made sword.  Finally this entity decided to make all its worshipers OCD by forcing them to partake in a ritual 5 times a day and forcing them to face a certain direction but that entity forgot to remember that the universe is vast and that when its creations will move to the other side of the galaxy it will be impossible to find said direction...or that when the local star will explode due to losing its fuel, the earth will be destroyed removing the direction where his worshipers are supposed to face.  Come to think of it this entity sounds a lot like a 7th century uneducated person"

Really a great place when you're young.  I started questioning Islam at about your age. I had private religion classes so the more I studied Islam the more I questioned it. I kept it to myself though. Even after I started college where I lived alone I never told my parents (I've been living away from family ever since because of work). I'm sure they suspect since they've never seen me pray or even celebrate end of ramadhan with them. But at my age now, I really couldn't care less whether they knew or not.  Thing is faith is a personal matter. Your parents and anyone else have no business to tell you who/what to worship or not. If someone makes a big deal about me being an atheist, I just say if you want me to respect your religion then respect my non-religion. I don't get into religious argument.

I'd say the best thing you could do is to keep reading it; read the whole thing if you can.   Think of it this way: if Islam is true and correct, then in studying the Quran and Islam honestly, then you will find that it is true. And if Islam is not true and correct, then in studying the Quran and Islam honestly, then you will find that it is false. Either wayyou will benefit (because you'll either be more convinced of its truth, or get rid of a falsehood).   I don't know what to believe. And I can't say I'm not a muslim, if I decide I don't believe in Islam because my family will get super angry.

Yes, you will definitely break your mother's heart if you come out now. You're young, still in school and have no financial independence. If you come out now, then likely your social life will explode, some people could turn on you and, at worst, you may get kicked out of your home (it's happened to some of us). The best thing you can do is to keep it to yourself.   Rather, keep studying this yourself and come to terms with it on your own before you involve other people. As you grow older, and mature, and think about this more you'll have a better understanding of how to deal with it.  In the meanwhile, feel free to post any questions you have on this forum, to rant, or to just ask for advice as you've done here. Take care of yourself.

exmuslim,3dd33h,scientus,2,Wed Jul 15 12:42:12 2015 UTC,"I think most of us would agree with you. Many of us read the Quran and didn't like what we found in there. I'd say the best thing you could do is to keep reading it; read the whole thing if you can.   On a deeper level, question why would you ever surrender your judgement to a book, or to a preacher, or to anyone? Listen, read but always think for yourself.  The core idea of islam is to not have any ideas, to just 'submit' and do as you are told."

You don't have to decide right now what to believe many people spend their whole life not knowing but my advice to is that you Should focus on school and on your studies and your carrer and less on islam especially at your age.while you still live at home.  Having debates and arguments or even question the religion to your friends and family may upset them and nobody wants to upset their family and want a good relationship with your parents but sometimes it's doesn't workout and it's not possible..  My advice to you is to only debate religion on internet not with people you know irl if you care about them. Remember real truth never fears doubt & dissent  and people who don't want you to think are not your friends.  I have a made a long FAQ with counter arguments aganist common arguments muslim make but maybe it's better if you wait a couple of years before diving in to this."

But honestly, if I find explanations to my questions, and am happy with the answers . I'll stick to Islam. But I think it's very important that I hear both sides of the story from for islam and against islam.   The interesting thing is to see what people would have as a religion if they weren't born into one, and manipulated. My guess is mostly athiest and the easiest religion.

What you should be cautious about, is letting how you feel about myths and mysticism reach your parents or family. As someone who is young you assumedly are not yet in a position where you can fully take care of yourself.  Follow the religion and enjoy it if you can while it is still there. Develop your own ideas and think for yourself in the mean time. Whether or not to tell religious people you are not religious, is a decision you can make in time. It isn't worth it to do it now.

exmuslim,3dd33h,CadmeusCain,2,Thu Jul 16 00:24:24 2015 UTC,"so I'm going to stick to the Holy Quran   Look at Sahih hadiths too. They are part of authentic Islamic literature and cannot be ignored. What I mean is, look at everything.  If you just want to look at the Quran:  4:34 - wife beating (no excuse no matter what)  5:38 - ISIS like barbaric punishment of chopping off the hands of a thief. Here's a video of this amazing Quranic verse being implemented. Please, watch the video ..... This is Quran being implemented. If you dont want to watch a Quranic verse being implemented, you should know you have no reason to be a Muslim.  56:36 - Virgins will be provided (is Allah a pimp or... what?)  78:33 - Those virgins will have BIG TITS. --- Enough said, right?  A god who promises his followers virgins with BIG TITS.  Is there any reason to be a Muslim after this verse? If so..... read on:  Multiple sahih Hadiths confirm marriage of Muhammad to 9 year old Aisha. You cannot ignore hadiths, you cannot be Quran-only. Sahih hadiths are part of Islamic history, especially when multiple Sahih hadiths confirm the same things.  As for a link being anti-Islamic, once again the good anti-Islamic sites just quote Islamic texts so they cannot take any blame for doing it.  So.. what else.  There's also lots of verses about torture in Hell. A God that tortures people in Hell for just following their parents religions (something that the vast majority do; a small percentage is able to leave their parents religion) is a horrible God, worse than Hitler. He's not worthy of worship and he's not a real God.  Honestly if you still go Muslim after given all the evidence in this thread, thats up to you. There are a billion Muslims in the world. One more is not a big problem.... so you're under no pressure. Do what you think is right and makes sense."

When you debate with Muslims, one of their common complaint is ""You have to  know Arabic to understand the Quran""  If the message can only be understood correctly in Arabic, then Allah should forgive every non-Muslim who doesnt speak Arabic.

This is a supposition. Perhaps, the old man knew she had fornicated for some reason we do not know for monkeys are the most fornicating animals. Arabs refer to them as examples of (exaggerated) fornication and say: “fornicating more than a monkey”. Unless fornication is common among them, they would not be used as an example. There is none closer to man in marriage and jealousy than them. The animals get hostile with one another, jump over and punish one another. Some bite, some scratch, some break and some smash. Monkeys stone with their hands whom Allah created as man stones. If they stoned one another for a cause rather than fornication and the old man thought it is fornication, it would not be far. If the old man knew about fornication by some evidence and that stoning was for it, it would not be far either because – as I have informed you – they are the most jealous among animals and the closest to man regarding understanding.

I used to think this was weird when I was younger. This is just a preference and does not mean that I don't find dark skinned girls attractive.  Once my aunt started discussing marriage and said she didn't have a problem with who I married so long as that girl was a pious Muslim. My dad didn't like this one bit. He immediately said I could never marry someone that wasn't Somali.  Another time my brother said something along the lines of ""what if I marry a non-Somali"". My dad got angry and gave the same response of the before and added that the girl has to be from the same tribe as well. I don't think he was serious about the tribe part.  I discussed it with him once and he more or less said cultures are too different and it's too difficult. I didn't agree but whatever.

My sister once told my dad that he can't force her to get married because it is against Islam and that made him angry.  It's strange because my dad is religious and my parents are rather educated about Islam partly because my dad went to university on Egypt. For example my parents did not practice FGM even though 98% of Somalis practice it because they know it's just african culture and not Islamic.  Anyway I'm still a practicing Muslim so it doesn't make sense for me to cause such a huge rift between my family and me over something small. When the time comes if my dad is really not gonna budge I'll just go along with it.   There will probably be other problems anyway.

When we talk seriously about marriage I'm sure he'll let me decide when and who. Doesn't sound like he'd compromise about marrying a non-Somali but I don't mind that anyway. It's just a small insignificant preference.   Do you ever plan to move to Somalia, if it ever gets better I mean?   I probably won't move to Somalia. I've been to Somalia recently (in the past year). As it is now I would never move there. If it grows explosively like the UAE did during the past 30 years then I might move back there later but certainly not any time soon.  Somalia has untapped resources of Uranium, natural gas and very likely undiscovered oil too. But the political climate and Shabab means they cannot utilize these resources. Even if things change very soon and Somalia is able to tap into its resources and begin developing it will probably take 20-30 years for Somalia to reach a level of development such that I'd want to live there.  I'm no expert so everything above may be wrong (except the resources part)   I just don't feel like raising my kids in the states.   That's good. The UAE is a good place. It's both a Muslim country and its rather well-developed compared to the rest of the region. Downside is that it is rather expensive here however.

exmuslim,3ddpat,Cjminor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:21:46 2015 UTC,Not sure what matho means. Anyway I didn't say I don't like dark skin girls. I said it is a 'preference'. It's no different than someone preferring flat-chested girls.  Everyone is attracted to different features. Skin/hair color can be one of those.  Are you Somali?
exmuslim,3ddpat,AShiftInTime,3,Wed Jul 15 20:11:28 2015 UTC,"Matho means black, I'm surprised you don't know what that means since you're a 'somali'. Not liking dark skinned girls is not the same as not liking flat chests. Most times when people say they don't find dark skin attractive it's due to the assumed facial traits associated with said complexion. Afrocentric features don't align with the Eurocentric features that the media deems as beautiful/handsome. Since most Somalis/East Africans in general don't fit those assumed traits they are seen as a better/aesthetically pleasing alternative to 'regular' Africans. (That doesn't make it right) That's why when you see fashion magezines and look at the top black models they usually hail from certain parts of Africa, although there exceptions are made by which they may choose models with Afrocentric features due to them being 'exotic', which it's self is akin to fetishizing.   Overall this mainly why you see the popular opinion of not finding dark skinned girls attractive everywhere. Or that we look 'masculine' just because the tone of our skin, it comes from a lack of experience with varying races and exposure to other races. Also racist ideals perpetrated by the media have a hand in it as well. I'm just surprised that a Somali would ever say such a thing due to you having first hand experience with the variety of different features us Africans posses."
exmuslim,3ddpat,Cjminor,2,Wed Jul 15 21:04:58 2015 UTC,"I was born in America but I only lived there for close to 9 years. I've lived the rest of my life in the UAE hence why I'm not familiar with slang like matho. I also didn't know that black men being 'masculine' was a stereotype until reading something like that a few days ago on reddit. As far as masculinity goes I only knew of asians being stereotypically considered less masculine.   Black people here are just like everyone else. Sure I knew that in America their considered to be more athletic, dangerous and 'unintelligent' (among other stereotypes) but I didn't know masculinity was one of them. I suppose it makes sense. Masculinity and athleticism go hand in hand.  I was raised in a rather religious household. I never really looked at fashion magazines or payed attention to celebrities. I barely used to watch TV. Media perpetuating eurocentric features as ideal? Never noticed. Guess it helps that I'm in the UAE.  Here is what I don't get. You say that:   It comes from a lack of experience with varying races and exposure to other races.   In other words people who find whites more attractive than blacks only find them more attractive because they've had more exposure to whites than blacks; They know how wide the variety of features that whites have are but for blacks they are unaware partly because the racist media selects certain few traits that are deemed 'good' (east according to you) or 'exotic'. In other words had they had more exposure to blacks there would find be some that are equally attractive?  Sorry that doesn't make sense to me. No one ever said it was because of African features that are tied to skin color. They just said they find people of certain skin color less attractive. Perhaps its actually because of the skin complexion itself if the features tied to a skin color are so diverse that it's impossible to find some features that are attractive."

Honestly, I find them to be more like an extension to my family. I feel that's because I come from an immigrant family and when we was younger any other somali family was treated like family, since our actual family members were left behind in the motherland.  Saying that doesn't mean I have a preference for lighter/whiter skinned people. I've had more crushes on non-white individuals just not many Somalis.

Knowledge of religion has never been higher, it's obedience to doctrine that has dropped and often because of increased religious knowledge."
exmuslim,3ddkiv,Atheizm,8,Wed Jul 15 14:01:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah so the problem with many 'signs' of the end times is that they often can be applied to almost any time. People IN the time of Jesus thought they were living in the End Times. people IN the time of Muhammad thought they were living in the End Times. 1400 years later and we're still waiting. I don't think they are oddly specific, so I'll start tackling them.   The disappearance of knowledge and the appearance of ignorance (Bukhari, Muslim, Ibn Majah, & Ahmad)   This can literally be said about any time. What is meant by knowledge and ignorance? We actually live in a time where the average man is more educated and knowledgeable that at any point in history. Almost no one in Muhammad's time could read or write. In our times, the reverse is true.   Books/writing will be widespread and (religious) knowledge will be low (Ahmad   With the Quran being available in almost every language in the world, the reverse is actually true. People know about religion, and different religions, than they ever did thanks to the internet.   Adultery and fornication will be prevalent   What about the Ancient Greeks? This has been common in so many societies around the world.   When fornication becomes widespread among your leaders   Always has been. Look up the sexual conquests of great rulers and kings.   The consumption of intoxicants will be widespread   It's been this way for thousands of years?   Women will outnumber men......eventually 50:1   Women do outnumber men, but less than they did before. Go look it up. This is because male infant mortality rate, and male mortality rates are higher than the corresponding ones for women. This is less the case today than it was before.   Killing, killing, killing    Always been true. Muhammad himself killed oh so many.   People will beat others with whips like the tails of oxen (Muslim)   Slavery is actually abolished in most countries. Happens less than before.   The children will be filled with rage   Lol, could this be more general? If anything, cultures are less violence than they used to be.   Rain will be acidic or burning    Lol   When a trust becomes a means of making a profit    True in almost every merchant culture? Including the time of the Quraish when Muhammad showed up?   Gains will be shared out only among the rich, with no benefit to the poor    True in every merchant culture, including Muhammad's.   There will be people who will be brethren in public but enemies in secret    Has always been true, likely to always be true.   When a man obeys his wife and disobeys his mother; and treats his friend kindly while shunning his father   So general.   Great distances will be traversed in short spans of time   Wow! Could they get more general than this! What is a 'short' span of time?  Let me make a prediction: ""When the end times are coming, people will live long lives"".   People will hop between the clouds and the earth   Lol. Don't see this happening.   The leader of a people will be the worst of them   This has always been true? Some people consider Muhammad to be an example of this.   Leaders of people will be oppressors   Was true before Muhammad's time, was true during his time, will be true after.   Time will pass rapidly    Time passes just as quickly now as it did before. This is hogwash.  .  Do I even need to go on? These are a joke..."

And because he could easily say: ""No one knows when the hour will come"" it could easily be said that these signs would only matter after his lifetime, in which case he could make these predictions with impunity.  But then if any one of these conveniently comes true (they're so vague that some of them must), he could just turn around and say: ""I predicted it all along!"". Look up cold reading. It's human psychology to circle the hits and ignore the misses.  If he makes these predictions all the time, people will be like ""Oh, guess we should watch out for that"". But the one day something happens like ""People will be mean to one another"" they'll turn around and say ""Mo was right all along!""  Making these predictions is actually risk free. On the other hand, if he said something like: ""Allah has told me that, by the end of the year, the King of Abyssinia will be murdered by his own son"" or ""Allah has told me that we will conquer Makkah in year XXX"".

His response was that he knew that and accepted it, but that the other side of political spectrum trumpeted the whole ""dirty brown muzzie barbarians, carpet bomb their countries and convert them to christianity"" perspective. His reasoning is that, if there is wide bipartisan support for saying islam is violent and intolerant, society, and possibly even the law, will make life a lot harder for muslims in the states - and, of course, people like us, from muslim backgrounds with muslim faces.  It is disingenuous and dishonest, but this position of defending Islam against the right is part of preventing the demonization of people of a certain background. Knowing that, I can appreciate it.

Exactly the same structures in islamic scripture which have been used by Muhammad to gain power are now used by ISIS.

The ""elephant"" is that Islam positively encourages war booty and the captured slaves as lawful and good & legitimises the capture and rape of women as war booty.    Slavery is legal, as are women as they are war booty.  You are authorised to force them to have sex after ensuring they are not already pregnant. We have irrefutable proof of these things.  Quran8:69: So consume what you have taken of war booty [as being] lawful and good, and fear Allah . Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  Sahih Bukhari 9:506 Mohammed extorts his men not to use the withdrawal method on captured (i.e. war booty slave) women.  The last sentence if Sahih Muslim 8:3432 is also worth noting:  The victorious Muslims were minded to refrain from raping the wives of Kafirs, but luckily Allah allowed it: ""And women already married, except those whom your right hands possess (iv. 24)"" (i. e. they were lawful for them when their 'Idda period came to an end)."""

exmuslim,3dbuzy,vestayekta,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:17:28 2015 UTC,"What about the tensions between protestants and catholics? And religion plays a role in the intervention of the Brits.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliput_and_Blefuscu  One morning, about a fortnight after I had obtained my liberty, Reldresal, principal secretary (as they style him) for private affairs, came to my house attended only by one servant.  He ordered his coach to wait at a distance, and desired I would give him an hours audience; which I readily consented to, on account of his quality and personal merits, as well as of the many good offices he had done me during my solicitations at court.  I offered to lie down that he might the more conveniently reach my ear, but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand during our conversation.  He began with compliments on my liberty; said “he might pretend to some merit in it;” but, however, added, “that if it had not been for the present situation of things at court, perhaps I might not have obtained it so soon.  For,” said he, “as flourishing a condition as we may appear to be in to foreigners, we labour under two mighty evils: a violent faction at home, and the danger of an invasion, by a most potent enemy, from abroad.  As to the first, you are to understand, that for about seventy moons past there have been two struggling parties in this empire, under the names of Tramecksan and Slamecksan, from the high and low heels of their shoes, by which they distinguish themselves.  It is alleged, indeed, that the high heels are most agreeable to our ancient constitution; but, however this be, his majesty has determined to make use only of low heels in the administration of the government, and all offices in the gift of the crown, as you cannot but observe; and particularly that his majesty’s imperial heels are lower at least by a drurr than any of his court (drurr is a measure about the fourteenth part of an inch).  The animosities between these two parties run so high, that they will neither eat, nor drink, nor talk with each other.  We compute the Tramecksan, or high heels, to exceed us in number; but the power is wholly on our side.  We apprehend his imperial highness, the heir to the crown, to have some tendency towards the high heels; at least we can plainly discover that one of his heels is higher than the other, which gives him a hobble in his gait.  Now, in the midst of these intestine disquiets, we are threatened with an invasion from the island of Blefuscu, which is the other great empire of the universe, almost as large and powerful as this of his majesty.  For as to what we have heard you affirm, that there are other kingdoms and states in the world inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself, our philosophers are in much doubt, and would rather conjecture that you dropped from the moon, or one of the stars; because it is certain, that a hundred mortals of your bulk would in a short time destroy all the fruits and cattle of his majesty’s dominions: besides, our histories of six thousand moons make no mention of any other regions than the two great empires of Lilliput and Blefuscu.  Which two mighty powers have, as I was going to tell you, been engaged in a most obstinate war for six-and-thirty moons past.  It began upon the following occasion.  It is allowed on all hands, that the primitive way of breaking eggs, before we eat them, was upon the larger end; but his present majesty’s grandfather, while he was a boy, going to eat an egg, and breaking it according to the ancient practice, happened to cut one of his fingers.  Whereupon the emperor his father published an edict, commanding all his subjects, upon great penalties, to break the smaller end of their eggs.  The people so highly resented this law, that our histories tell us, there have been six rebellions raised on that account; wherein one emperor lost his life, and another his crown.  These civil commotions were constantly fomented by the monarchs of Blefuscu; and when they were quelled, the exiles always fled for refuge to that empire.  It is computed that eleven thousand persons have at several times suffered death, rather than submit to break their eggs at the smaller end.  Many hundred large volumes have been published upon this controversy: but the books of the Big-endians have been long forbidden, and the whole party rendered incapable by law of holding employments.  During the course of these troubles, the emperors of Blefusca did frequently expostulate by their ambassadors, accusing us of making a schism in religion, by offending against a fundamental doctrine of our great prophet Lustrog, in the fifty-fourth chapter of the Blundecral (which is their Alcoran).  This, however, is thought to be a mere strain upon the text; for the words are these: ‘that all true believers break their eggs at the convenient end.’  And which is the convenient end, seems, in my humble opinion to be left to every man’s conscience, or at least in the power of the chief magistrate to determine.  Now, the Big-endian exiles have found so much credit in the emperor of Blefuscu’s court, and so much private assistance and encouragement from their party here at home, that a bloody war has been carried on between the two empires for six-and-thirty moons, with various success; during which time we have lost forty capital ships, and a much a greater number of smaller vessels, together with thirty thousand of our best seamen and soldiers; and the damage received by the enemy is reckoned to be somewhat greater than ours.  However, they have now equipped a numerous fleet, and are just preparing to make a descent upon us; and his imperial majesty, placing great confidence in your valour and strength, has commanded me to lay this account of his affairs before you.”  I desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the emperor; and to let him know, “that I thought it would not become me, who was a foreigner, to interfere with parties; but I was ready, with the hazard of my life, to defend his person and state against all invaders.”  http://www.gutenberg.org/files/829/829-h/829-h.htm"

exmuslim,3dbuzy,exapologetica,2,Wed Jul 15 20:57:13 2015 UTC,"A lot of wars today go back to decades if not a century of poor rule. For the most part when the Ottoman empire was split up and Britain redrew the map and did their usual divide and conquere routine it was only a matter of time till things would come undone. Now the world needs to witness the undoing of colonialism in parts of the world. It's going to be messy.    Unfortunately, this critique overstates how arbitrary today’s Middle East borders really are, overlooks how arbitrary every other border in the world is, implies that better borders were possible, and ignores the cynical imperial practices that actually did sow conflict in the region.  A quick tour of present-day borders reveals a few key similarities with the local Ottoman boundaries in place before the French and British arrived. The three separate provinces -- Mosul, Baghdad and Basra -- that were joined to make Iraq, for example, were often treated as a coherent economic and military area by the Ottoman government. And of course, the region’s geographic unity going back to the origins of human civilization, had long been recognized in the term “Mesopotamia.” Meanwhile, the fact that Iraq’s eastern border with Iran followed a line set by the 16th-century conquests of Suleiman the Magnificent didn’t prevent the countries from fighting a decade-long conflict over it that killed ten times more people than all the Arab-Israeli wars combined. To the West, Mount Lebanon had been carved out as a special administrative unit following religious violence there in 1860 as a compromise between Istanbul and the Great Powers. (That this region should nonetheless belong to Syria was perhaps one of the Assad regime’s least controversial positions over the years.) The only country in the area for which no ancient borders existed was Jordan -- it was formed in 1922 from some not-too-desirable bits of arid land as something for Britain’s ally, Abdullah, to be king of. Like most kings, he would have liked something bigger, and yet under his family’s rule Jordan has been spared much of the turmoil endured by its less “artificial” neighbors.  Even if Britain and France had set out to divide the Middle East with the best of intentions, which admittedly they did not, it’s far from clear how they could have done better. At best, creating more countries would have just meant more borders to fight over, while fewer large countries would have turned regular wars into civil ones.   In Iraq, for example, creating smaller independent states would only have prefigured the conflicts dividing Iraq today. A predominantly Kurdish state built around the old Ottoman province of Mosul would almost inevitability have become ensnared in the ongoing conflict between the Republic of Turkey and its own Kurdish minority. Similarly, Shiite Iran would have had religious grounds to try to incorporate a small Shiite state based around Basra, whereas a state based around the central province of Baghdad would have hated to sit back and watch its neighbors grow rich off oil deposits that it lacked.   Also consider this: Algeria was a colony of the Ottoman Empire for 300 years and was only a French colony for 132 years and during much of that time French rule was quite limited. Tunisia was an Ottoman colony for more than 131 years and was a French protectorate for only 75 years. The territories that are now Libya were colonies of the Ottoman Empire for 360 years then were an Italian colony for less than 32 years. Egypt was under Ottoman sovereignty for 365 years while the British held control over Egypt for only 40 years. Palestine was under Ottoman rule for 401 years and a British mandate for 26 years. Syria was ruled by the Ottomans for 402 years and was a French mandate (along with Lebanon) for a mere 21 years. Iraq was part of the Ottoman Empire for 387 years and was then a British mandate for a mere 12 years. That is pretty much the whole of North Africa and the Middle East (the “Middle East” being defined in my education as the area from Egypt to Iran) other than Iran which had never, officially, been under the rule of a European power though it did have a British sphere of influence in the south and a Russian sphere of influence in the north (though not every Russian would consider Russia a “European” country by any means). So, how is it that “western colonialism” is held to blame for nearly every problem in the modern Middle East and North Africa when in most cases European rule lasted less than fifty years rather than the colonialism of the Turks who ruled the region for centuries?"

It is as if the empires of the Ottomans, or the Arabs had never existed!  Everyone, from individuals to entire nations, rise or fall and live or die based on the choices they make. Blaming colonialism for modern problems is pointless and provably false. The Korean peninsula was, for a time, under the colonial rule of Japan and the Japanese did not always treat the Koreans with absolute loving kindness, however, South Korea still managed to become an extremely successful and prosperous country. an extremely successful and prosperous country. North Korea, obviously, did not but, as South Korea proves, the Japanese cannot be held to blame for that. North Korea is a failed state because it adopted an astoundingly stupid political and economic system. North Africa and the Middle East are no different. Where they have problems, it is the result of choices they have made. For the Middle East and North Africa the choices made include cutting colonial ties, pursuing bad policies and, in the cases of Libya, Egypt and Iraq, overthrowing existing monarchies in favor of militaristic republics. Sometimes it only takes one mistake to derail things if that mistake is big enough and as long as you play the blame game that one big mistake will never be corrected."

exmuslim,3dac0n,party_at_valinor,-2,Thu Jul 16 16:15:39 2015 UTC,"First I'd like to say that I support women being able to wear whatever they want. Furthermore I don't support the Hijab in any way shape or form.  Second, There are many misconceptions about the Hijab as being mandatory for ALL women in Islam. I can't post it because it's in a book, but in the book ""No God but God"" by Reza Aslan he goes in depth about the history and eventual adoptation of the hijab into the wider muslim culture, which wasn't done during Muhammads time, in fact it was adopted WAY after Muhammad's time.  ""The evidence is all around you: women still struggle to gain equal status as men as voter in Islamic nations; you can’t drive in Saudi Arabia; you can’t let your hair lose outdoor in Iran, and if you get groped in Cairo, it’s your fault you are too enticing."" - When the author talks about Hijab policies in places like KSA or other countries, I'd like to point out that those are BAD laws and Problems of that country, and the greater MUSLIM societies, not neccessarily Islam.  In the Islamic context, the mechanism behind recommending women to wear hijab stem from these very instinct to control the basic liberty of women, as well as to transfer the ownership and control of the females in a household to the males, eventually, perpetuating what we call, a patriarchy. I do agree that wearing a Hijab or anything that the Hijab stands for is not a ""Feminist statement"" . - THIS IS NOT THE TRUE CONTEXT OF HIJAB, this is SJW sensationalism. - The only time anything related to the modern perception of what is considered hijab in the Quran is in reference to the Prophet's wives and only them. This was done to distinguish the wives of Muhammad from other women. Now if people want to argue that this can be practiced under sunnah, that is another argument, but nowhere in the Quran does it say it is mandatory for Hijab.  - Yes the Quran DOES advocate for women to dress modestly, but there are many factors that can determine what dressing modestly means. The most simple explanation of modesty,  is in correlation to the society that the individual lives in. If a society deems a dress, bikini, burkah as modest than it is considered modest.  - Furthermore women of every religion (Hinduism, judaism, christianity) were told to ""Cover up"" to what extent that's another story. - I do agree with the author when she says that if Hijab is worn out of preference it's cool but if its done out of mandatory cirumstances, for one to feel morally superior, or to show subjugation than its wrong.  Hijab, a dress code imposed by a male prophet who asserted modesty in the name of covering a woman’s body to secure her sexuality and therefore her net worth, is nonetheless a statement of oppression - This is not true, the dress code was NEVER established by Mohammad.  it was of women being tied to a male seen as superior guardian, it was the idea that a woman is not free to choose what she wants to wear for herself without reflecting whether it would anger the God, it was the idea that she needs to seek a male permission before committing to education, career, or even go outside for grocery  - This isn't true either. Khadjia, the Prophet's first wife was one of the wealthiest traders in her time and Muhammad's EMPLOYER. As a Shia I'm saying this, Aisha was a SCHOLAR on the Quran. According to Shia belief Zainab LEAD the immate after Karbala. There are so many things wrong with the author's analysis.  and you can see the evidence in the legal codes of Saudi Arabia, or in Mosul where ISIS’s tyranny is inspired by Islam. - Very little of what KSA or ISIS does has any roots in Islam.  progress in gender equality swept Egypt, and Afghanistan, until a much later Islamism movement took over that imposed new rules such as making hijab mandatory in Iraq, reduced economic and political liberty of women in Eqypt, Afghanistan – all in the name of Islam - The author is missing a TON of history. Islamism throughout the Muslim world was propelled by the Cold war conflict. Anyone who has a decent knowledfe of modern history knows who supported who in Afghanistan. - HIJAB WAS and IS NOT mandatory in Iraq. - Islamism is a cancer but it is a political ideology with a lot of corrupted views on Islam.   Hijab has no universal basis, - While I don't agree with the modern concept of hijab, and as I say Hijab IS NOT mandatory in Islam, there is a historical acceptance of hijab in other religions and cultures.  Hijab implies a complete submission of a woman’s sexuality and reproductive rights in the name of Allah, and to the principles of lifestyle laid out by a 14th Century Quran and a Holy Prophet who could not reason beyond the censorship of the human body.  - None of this is true."

I don't acknowledge any Hadiths, in many circles they are regarded to be heavily fabricated.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab   ""These guidelines (for covering of the entire body except for the hands, the feet and the face) are found in texts of fiqh and hadith developed ""AFTER"" the revelation of the Quran.  The Quran mandates Hijab for both men and women, the word ""hijab"" does not mean headscarf, but cover. ""The Quran tells the male believers (Muslims) to talk to the wives of Muhammad behind a curtain. This curtain was the responsibility of the men and not the wives of Muhammad. This leads some to claim that the mandate of the Quran to wear hijab applies to the wives of Muhammad, not women generally. ""Some Muslims take a relativist approach to hijab. They believe that the commandment to maintain modesty must be interpreted with regard to the surrounding society. What is considered modest or daring in one society might not be considered so in another. It is important, they say, for believers to wear clothing that communicates modesty and reserve."" According to at least three authors (Karen Armstrong, Reza Aslan and Leila Ahmed), the stipulations of the hijab were originally meant only for Muhammad's wives, and were intended to maintain their inviolability. This was because Muhammad conducted all religious and civic affairs in the mosque adjacent to his home:   People were constantly coming in and out of this compound at all hours of the day. When delegations from other tribes came to speak with Prophet Muhammad, they would set up their tents for days at a time inside the open courtyard, just a few feet away from the apartments in which Prophet Muhammad's wives slept. And new emigrants who arrived in Yatrib would often stay within the mosque's walls until they could find suitable homes - According to Ahmed: By instituting seclusion Prophet Muhammad was creating a distance between his wives and this thronging community on their doorstep - They argue that the term darabat al-hijab (""taking the veil""), was used synonymously and interchangeably with ""becoming Prophet Muhammad's wife"", and that during Muhammad's life, no other Muslim woman wore the hijab. Aslan suggests that Muslim women started to wear the hijab to emulate Muhammad's wives, who are revered as ""Mothers of the Believers"" in Islam,[10] and states ""THERE WAS NO TRADITION OF VEILING UNTIL AROUND 627 C.E."" in the Muslim community.[10][11] - The burqa (also spelled burka) is the garment that covers women most completely: either only the eyes are visible, or nothing at all. ORIGINATING IN WHAT IS NOW PAKISTAN.  Furthermore, where does the Quran or even the hadith say anything about reproductive rights?

"" Men have authority over women because God has made the one superior to the other, and because they spend their wealth to maintain them. Good women are obedient. They guard their unseen parts because God has guarded them. As for those whom you fear disobedience, admonish them and send them to beds apart and beat them.

exmuslim,3dac0n,megatron_x,3,Wed Jul 15 07:56:34 2015 UTC,"The dress code was NEVER established by Mohammad...eventual adoptation of the hijab into the wider muslim culture, which wasn't done during Muhammads time, in fact it was adopted WAY after Muhammad's time....The only time anything related to the modern perception of what is considered hijab in the Quran is in reference to the Prophet's wives and only them.   This is not true at all. Quran 33:59 says:    O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e.screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allah is Ever OftForgiving, Most Merciful.  (Mohsin Khan translation)   The ""women of the believers"" are ordinary Muslim women. The verse is explicitly commanding them to cover up too, in addition to Muhammad's wives and daughters. And it's commanding Muhammad to tell them to cover up so your claim that the adoption of the hijab occurred way after Muhammad's time and that he didn't establish a dress code are incorrect (see below).   Yes the Quran DOES advocate for women to dress modestly, but there are many factors that can determine what dressing modestly means.   No, the Quran is clear on what it means by modest dress. Quran 33:59 commands women to wear jilbabs. The Arabic term used in the verse is jalabibihinna which means ""their jilbabs"", translated as ""their cloaks (veils)"" in the translation I've quoted above.  The jilbab is understood to be a garment that covers the head, neck and face. This is confirmed by the reports of Muhammad's companions and classical scholars mentioned in Tafsir Ibn Kathir. And from this and this hadith, it's abundantly clear that ordinary Muslim women immediately covered their heads and even their faces after Quran 24:31 was revealed.   THIS IS NOT THE TRUE CONTEXT OF HIJAB   No, this is:   Al-Dahhak and al-Suddi said: “This verse was revealed about those adulterers who used to roam the streets of Medina and follow the women who come out at night to relieve themselves. When they saw a woman, they approached her and winked at her. If the woman did not say anything, they followed her; but if she rebuked them, they left her alone. Actually, these adulterers were only after slave girls. But at that time, freewomen were not distinguishable from slave-girls. All women used to go out wearing a chemise and a headscarf. The women complained to their husbands who mentioned the matter to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse”. The proof for the soundness of the above opinion is the saying of Allah, exalted is He (O Prophet! Tell thy wives and thy daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks close round them…) [33:59].  Sa'id ibn Muhammad al-Mu'adhdhin informed us> Abu 'Ali al-Faqih> Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn al-Junayd> Ziyad ibn Ayyub> Hushaym> Husayn> Abu Malik who said: “The believing women were in the habit of going out at night to relieve themselves, but the hypocrites used to approach and malign them. This verse was revealed about this”. Said al-Suddi: “The houses of Medina used to be narrow. [For this reason,] women used to wait until nightfall in order to go out to relieve themselves. The corrupt of Medina also used to go out at night. Whenever they saw a woman with a cover, they said: 'This is a freewoman', and they left her alone. But whenever they saw a woman without cover, they said: 'This is a slave', and tempted her to commit adultery. Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse about this matter”  (Source: Al-Wahidi's Asbab al-Nuzul)   So apparently there was a group of men who used to harass women, slave women in particular, in Medina during Muhammad's time. Instead of stopping them, Muhammad told free women to wear jilbabs so that they would be distinguishable from slave women and not be harassed (because apparently it's totally okay to sexually harass slave women).   Khadjia, the Prophet's first wife was one of the wealthiest traders in her time and Muhammad's EMPLOYER.   She was a wealthy trader and Muhammad's employer before Islam came into the world. The religion came into being 10 years before her death and was still in it's developmental phase during the time she was alive. Integral aspects of Islam like adhaan, fasting, zakat, the change of qiblah, etc all didn't exist back then, so it's unfair to use that half-baked form of Islam to claim that Muslim women don't need their male guardian's consent to do things. 'Fully baked' Islam is clear on this matter. Kindly do not use examples of Khadija's pre-Islamic status to claim that post-Islamic women have the same freedoms as her.  And it's strange that you should mention Zaynab bint Ali and Karbala while claiming that the hijab isn't obligatory. You're a Shia, as was I, so you should know that Yazid's army snatched away the hijabs/veils of Zaynab and the surviving women of Husayn's camp and Shias consider this outrageous because those men were preventing such important Muslim women from performing their obligatory duty to keep themselves veiled. How then can you then claim that the hijab or a dress code aren't mandatory? And how can you claim that the adoption of the hijab occurred way after Muhammad's death when Zaynab was Muhammad's contemporary? And Zaynab never lead the Imamate, the Imam after Husayn's death was Ali ibn Husayn."

exmuslim,3deqgf,durantula111,2,Wed Jul 15 18:18:31 2015 UTC,"The first claim is rather irrelevant. Plenty of peoples throughout the history of the world had home remedies for all sorts of ailments. Why would it be so special that Mohammed knew of a few?  The second claim I don't know. But when in doubt, read Galen. So much ""medical"" information in the Quran is taken directly from his work, it is suprising people can get away with claiming the Quran contains any ""new"" scientific facts."
exmuslim,3deqgf,blablahfish,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:41:10 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you're right about both points, but I'd need some proof that this was a home remedy used in those times.   As for the second claim, I'll check out Galen, but I wanted to tackle this specific point from a scientific perspective.  I am doing my own research still however, and will update this post with anything I find which provides sufficient answers. I wish I could just use your answer, but just making a general claim that medical information in Quran is stolen is not enough to sway minds sometimes! Although that would be enough for me personally, since I've read about many of these claims and agree they do a good job to debunk scientific facts in the Quran :)  EDIT: Thinking more on your first point, regarding home remedies existing for all sorts of ailments. I've given this some more thought and you're absolutely correct that lots of people throughout history have had home remedies which later turned out to have scientific basis. I don't think the existence of proof whether sucrose does help with pain relief or not validates the fact that Muhammad had advanced knowledge of science. Thanks!"
exmuslim,3deqgf,blablahfish,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:45:50 2015 UTC,"Remember, logically it is up to them to demonstrate that the information is miraculous, not up to you to demonstrate that the information isn't. Of course, most believers wont think that way, but still. If you can convince the person you are arguing with that they need to demonstrate the validity of their claim, then you are basically done.   About sugar aleviating pain. You don't need to demonstrate that such a home remedy already existed, you only offer a plausible way by which they could have gotten the information. Which is really simple, because it is information which could have been gotten by experimentation: Somebody only needed to give a baby honey once when the baby was in pain, and noticed that the baby cried less. Then you have it: sugar aleviate pains in babies. No need for God to explain how they got that information.  I'm currently skimming some of Galen's work, no luck yet. Aside from Galen, Erasistratus and Herophilus also wrote about the brain, as did Rufus of Ephesus. They could also be a possible source. As could any number of other ancient Greek writers. You can always make the argument that the ancient Greeks had fairly advanced knowledge of the brain, so it is hardly suprising that Mohammed would have made a statement along such lines.  Lastly, any claim that the Quran contains scientific knowledge coming from God, also needs to explain why the Quran contains blatent scientific errors. My favourite is 86:6-7, which basically says that sperm comes from the kidneys (which is, btw, what Galen had said). If God gave Mohammed all this correct information, why did he also pass along so much wrong information?"
exmuslim,3deqgf,blablahfish,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:20:48 2015 UTC,"Okey found it. The philospher Posidonius (around 370 AD) placed imagination in the frontal part of the brain, reasoning at the centre, and memory at the rear. The bishop Nemesius (around 390 AD) in his work De Natura hominis placed perception and imagination in the frontal part of the brain, memory in the middle of the brain, and motion in the rear of the brain. The highly influential philosopher Augustinus in his work The Literal Meaning of Genesis (401 AD) places sensation in the frontal part of the brain, memory at the centre and motion at the rear. Much later Avicenna (980-1037 AD, post Mohammed) placed fantasy in the front of the brain.  Clearly, the notion that the frontal part of the brain is the lying, sinful part of the brain isn't very of from the thought of the era which makes the frontal part of the brain responsible for sensation and imagination.  It would seem that, as usual, Mohammed was simply restating what much greater minds had said before him.  sources: http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~duchan/new_history/middle_ages/ventricular_theory.html  https://books.google.nl/books?id=gSKcBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=Posidonius+Ventricular+theory&source=bl&ots=YvK66ftRWJ&sig=gLuYO_OrYLKCtC34j1D3QkGvpLU&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAWoVChMIifPAy5PexgIVh14UCh0b2Q0k#v=onepage&q=Posidonius%20Ventricular%20theory&f=false"

Of course, without proper statistics it was usually quite difficult to determine what was working and what was not, but it's quite possible that the dates thing was tried by some random Arabian way before the Prophet, or even by the Prophet himself, and was found to work, and so found its way into the hadeeth literature.   Same for honey, which has indeed been found to have antiseptic qualities - this has no bearing on the truth/falsehood of the Prophet because it's quite probable he or someone before him figured out that putting honey on a wound prevents infection to a certain degree."

There was no courting involved. She was taken from her playground to marriage bed.     Narrated Aisha: The Prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six (years). We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Bani-al-Harith bin Khazraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became Allright, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, ""Best wishes and Allah's Blessing and a good luck."" Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah's Apostle came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age.       Look at paintings in art galleries of old men courting much much younger females. It was the done thing for hundreds and thousands of years.   They are no one's source of morality.   Also note that it's not the age difference that bothers many people. Aisha wasn't a woman. She was by any standard a child.    Romeo and Juliet are by all intense and purposes teenagers and by today's laws minors   Romeo and Juliet are both young. According to Shakespeare, Juliet is about 14 year old but the age of Romeo is not mentioned. However, his sources mention that she was either 16 or 18 and he was 16 or 20.

Higher education included one may not even work till they are in their 20's. In present times marriage isn't even an option till after education and career fulfillment.  In the times of prophet education was limited. Children worked like adults. There was no career ambitions or educational ambitions. Time was spent tending to the needs of the land e.g farming, trading, feuding. If that's all you got to look forward to in life...marriage was the next thing to tick off on that life box.

Mo married her because of a dream according to Islamic sources but it was quite obviously just to cement kinship with Abu Bakr. Nothing to do with life being hard for kids in this case, it was just a cultural norm to marry early to make these ties back then. Nobility of many Eurasian cultures did this as well. Nobles were certainly not having a hard time.   In the times of prophet education was limited. Children worked like adults. There was no career ambitions or educational ambitions.   You know people are in those situations today in poor places in the world (and even poor areas in the developed world)? It's not an antiquity thing. Does that make a child being forced to marry ok? Why don't you go read what these girls in say, Yemen, have to say about the ordeal of being married off to older men?    If we talk about present day then no.    So it was ok in Mo's time but it isn't now because life was harder back then?  Well, this argument only works if you're not a Muslim and don't believe Muhammad to be the Uswa Hasana."

Conclusion: Would I believe in Muhammad and Islam in the 7th century, yes because frankly as a Meccan with Muhammad marching on my city with 10,000 men I would fear for my life and wouldn't know any better anyways (science etc...) and would just go along with the crowd BUT would I believe in the same story in the 21st century? No, because even adults are different in the 21st century where they've probably have got education and have ambitions which isn't necessary to advance the territory of their king/ruler.  So just like you no longer look to Muhammad as best example for working out the ""right"" age of consent because ""those times were different"" so we should look at other things differently also e.g. be more tolerant to others with a difference of opinion."

Yeah child marriage indeed happens at present...I don't agree with those parents that do but it's cultural and financial necessity and obligation in most cases when one goes digging into why these marriages are taking place and it becomes abundantly clear it's not done with the full moral consent of the parents.

exmuslim,3dc64f,magich,4,Wed Jul 15 04:54:58 2015 UTC,"Seriously.  This is the mentality of most Muslims; defend whatever is fucked up as long as mo did it. The argument usually comes back to how it's only an issue today as someone made it an issue. Slavery was always an issue.. not just when countries started abolishing it. Same with child marriages; it was always an issue but not vocalized. Seriously, Islam had regressed women's voices so much that these fucking idiots are defending this pedo's actions expecting that there would have been someone who made it into an issue; these kids had/have no voice you fucking idiots.   ""Oh you have a problem with mo and Aisha?""   something about dessert climates and how humans develop faster -something about it being common practice something about how there wasn't much to do so marrying and fucking children was a way to solve this boredom (check this guy's comment history) -something about how nobody had a problem with it   This man is whom Muslims consider a prophet and an ideal man. They'll make the point that everyone should mimic his actions and his message and actions are relevant to this day. This man was considered divine and his actions he took back then is some form of lesson for Muslims today. If he was divine and had some type of connection with an 'all knowing' creator, god should have just been like ""hold on, I know you're old as fuck right now and that extremely tight girl seems like a good idea now, but believe me man, a holy person who is supposed to be an example to all of humanity shouldn't be fucking kids.. Just sayin""  Sorry man, just find people defending this as the epitome of apologetics."

Much like how Ukraine has a shortage of men after wars and such there simply are not enough men to marry every woman therefore polygamy is allowed. She said it was because Muslims were persecuted and at the time they were a very small group.  Its the most logical explanation from a Muslim I've heard.  She doesn't think it should be applicable in the modern world however and I asked isin't that Haram? and she went on a bit.
exmuslim,3dcpky,A_LIFE,9,Wed Jul 15 06:57:45 2015 UTC,"That doesn't count, because   1.) The word of the Koran should be applicable for all times.  2.) Why can't a women be alone ?

And this girl she's Moroccan and she hates France. she insists they are all racist but not to her because she is a ""good Moroccan"" but she doesn't like the culture or the people. However as a Moroccan she doesn't really have much choice but to go to France as their higher education is in French. I think if she went to study in America or Britain she would be a exmsulim but as things stands she wont even tolerate the idea because of her dislike of France.  This conversation happened on the day that guy started shouting at French people who were eating during Ramadam I asked her based upon that and Charlie can you really blame the French for being cautious until they get to know you? Again she didn't really have a answer for this.  She's a interesting one. Believes the Hijab is unislamic has read the Koran in parts is questioning the Koran at least in regards to women.

And then after sex which would be a huge disappointment by both of them because they're both inexperienced. the woman just become depressed and the dude just want to leave and marry someone else.   Then since they don't use condoms or any of that, she gets pregnant and he's pretty much stuck with her and she's stuck with him. For the guy it's easy out, just marry another girl. For her this is her life and she'll never be able to divorce or live normally unless he lets her too.

exmuslim,3d9jge,itistemp,3,Tue Jul 14 19:04:29 2015 UTC,"I was listening in on the Duaa after khatm tarawih yesterday, and a lot of it is playing on people's own latent guilt (I heard a crazy homeless lady say it the best, ""everyone's guilty of something"") and fears, like death, and being remembered after death. The notion that you will survive your own death is a very appealing one."

exmuslim,3d9jge,hexag1,2,Wed Jul 15 01:29:52 2015 UTC,"Fervor is a religious feeling common to almost all religions. It's the manifestation of awe, Muslims feel the power of their god and realize their total reliance on him, so they cry as an act of absolute submission and as a confession of weakness. At least, that's how it felt when I was a practicing Muslim.  Now it's just an intense emotion and of course it doesn't prove that a given religion is true, nor that a given deity exists and should be worshiped."

I'd been holding out hope that his speech would be worth the wait, but he literally spoke for about 5-10 minutes and then went out again, and that was it.

As an ex-moose trapped in a Muslim country, I think most ex-moose who live in the free world do not really understand the condition of our lives. It is not easy to move to West, if anything it is literally impossible. While west is happily taking millions of Muslim refugees there is no space for a minority that genuinely lives their lives in fear. Also, claiming asylum is a huge risk, because there is every chance that it might get rejected and if that is the case then you are fucked.  I have to say that i am very disappointed in ex-Muslim organizations in the West. They have done an exceptionally poor job in lobbying for our rights in the Western political systems, other communities like the Jewish and Gay communities have instead used the political system to make things better for their kind, for example, gay organisations are making it a lot easier for gay people in homophobic countries to move to liberal and tolerant ones. I hate to say that but ex-Moose orgainsations have done fuck all and so have the atheist organizations about helping ex-Muslims."

exmuslim,3d8r1y,itistemp,5,Tue Jul 14 17:10:28 2015 UTC,What do you think happen if Europe and the US stopped using petrol? I think it would be judgment day for Muslims.
exmuslim,3d8r1y,Allah-Of-Reddit,4,Tue Jul 14 17:56:34 2015 UTC,"What do you think happen if Europe and the US stopped using petrol?   Actually, that ""dystopian"" future for the petro states is nearer than they ever imagined. The US is going to be a net exporter of hydrocarbons pretty soon (within a few years). Although, Europe may not be free from it in the foreseeable future, however, the reduction in US demand for imported crude would still reduce the profits that they (petro states) have enjoyed in the last decade or so. In addition, with various emerging technologies (hydrogen, electric, gas/electric hybrids), the demand for petroleum per mile of travel will decrease for personal travel. Freight is a different story. Overall, I think the days, where they could command excessive profits are behind them. However, they wouldn't just disappear.   I think it would be judgment day for Muslims.   I still think, courtesy of the digital information revolution, the judgement day is coming irrespective of other factors. They may slow it down or hasten it, but its coming."
exmuslim,3d8r1y,itistemp,12,Tue Jul 14 18:32:21 2015 UTC,"Yup. We're pretty much on our own. We can't expect what little progress they make in the west to trickle down to the Muslim world in our lifetime.  What really sucks aside from being stuck with the Muslims here- is that the fuckups of some Muslims fortunate to be abroad, makes it more difficult for us go abroad.  Exmuslims are fucked from all sides. We have to fear Muslim backlash as well as backlash towards Muslims.  Which is why online communities are our best bet. I don't see us changing our societies but strengthening ourselves in the knowledge that there are others like us out there. The best we can do for now is to improve and strengthen ourselves as individuals by talking to others like us. Some day when the winds of change, blow in our favour, we (or perhaps the children we raise) will not be found wanting."
exmuslim,3d8r1y,Faith-Breaker,5,Tue Jul 14 17:28:51 2015 UTC,"It is not up to atheist organizations to help Muslims or ex-Muslims leave their countries.

exmuslim,3d8r1y,Speed__Racist,2,Sat Jul 18 21:47:17 2015 UTC,But the only societies in which open atheist societies exist are societies in which they'd be tolerated by the crowd and authorities.  So you're saying atheist societies should fight for relatively minor luxuries and ignore international stuff.  I like the international stuff because it shows how horrible religion is and it exposes how idiotic the complaints of feminists like Rebecca Watson are.  Atheism was going from strength to strength until Atheism Plus happened.
exmuslim,3d8r1y,Speed__Racist,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:46:35 2015 UTC,"All I'm saying is that helping people escape their country is beyond the mandate of most atheist organizations, though the Secular Policy Institute has an Atheist Asylum Program that fits the bill. Ideally it should be possible for anyone to apply to another country for asylum on the basis of belief persecution in their home country, depending on the countries involved. But I don't think simply declaring yourself to be an atheist is a valid basis for asylum seeking, generally speaking.  I agree about Watson and A+. But I'm optimistic for the future."

Like ""we can be cool and hip too, shock!"" no one gives a shit and they're just stepped on by Muslims for being a joke.   And the sad thing most of them criticise Ayan hirsi Ali and Sam Harris for being racist. Yeah, exactly shit on the only people who are standing by your side. I've seen Christians that stood up with ex Muslims better than those guys, no wonder some leave islam and become Christian.   Be more aggressive, have more balls. You're not going to do anything by doing drinking parties and talk about how you stopped wearing hijab. No one gives a damn. Criticise islam, the religion that want you dead.

It is not easy to leave, if anything West gives asylum to Islamists and Muslims rather than people who actually share the core values of liberalism and democracy.

It's like getting out of an abusive relationship, you need to find a strong support group and then move on from there. It's just that we can't be vocal about our dissent. I had a page for atheist Pakistanis that I had to shut down out of fear of being found out. I feel that this is something we really need to invest in. This will encourage more to come out and be vocal. The thing with ""group think"" is that it gets stronger and stronger the less and less opposition is present.

exmuslim,3daq1r,MudassirMEMD,-5,Tue Jul 14 21:58:22 2015 UTC,"/u/MudassirMEMD posted a similar objection earlier, here's my reponse:   Will women form a minority in paradise and a majority in Hell because they're ungrateful?  The debate is concerning the follow narration as well as some other ones similar to it:   Narrated ʾIbn ʿĀbbās: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “I was shown the Hell-fire and that the majority of its dwellers were women who were ungrateful.” It was asked,  “Do they disbelieve in God?” (or are they ungrateful to God?) He replied, “They are ungrateful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favors and the good (charitable deeds) done to them. If you have always been good (benevolent) to one of them and then she sees something in you (not of her liking), she will say, ‘I have never received any good from you.”    The very first thing that one should absolutely do when going through any ʾIslāmic Sources (whether the Qurʾān, the ḥadīṯ collections, fiqh …) is that you cannot pick up a verse or a ḥadīṯ, take it in isolation from the rest of others and run to races with it. One has to consider all the various ʾĀḥadīṯ pertaining to an issue one way or the other, consider the context of each of them and then draw some conclusion. Unfortunately most of ʾIslām’s critics fail on this account.  Let’s analyze now the context of that ḥadīṯ.   Clearly we see that at the time this was said, Holy Prophet (ﷺ) was not actually dwelling on the point if men or women will form the majority in the Hell and Paradise, he was only asking women to mend their ways and was pointing to a common problem in the attitude of the women.   The ḥadīṯ does not say they go to hell for being women, it actually points out to a wrong behavior on women’s part. The real misunderstanding comes with the notion that women outnumber men in hell because of their womanhood. This is indeed wrong, there is nothing like that in the Hadith, not even in the least.  In reality, and I know this may be surprising to you but: women will outnumber men in Paradise! This is derived from a ḥadīṯ in Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim:   Muḥammad reported that some (persons) stated with a sense of pride and some discussed whether there would be more men in Paradise or more women. It was upon this that ʾĀbu Huraīrah reported that Ābul Qāsīm (the Holy Prophet) (ﷺ) said: The (members) of the first group to get into Paradise would have their faces as bright as full moon during the night, and the next to this group would have their faces as bright as the shining stars in the sky, and every person would have two wives and the marrow of their shanks would glimmer beneath the flesh and there would be none without a wife in Paradise.[1]   The context of ʾĀbu Huraīrah narrating this ḥadīṯ clearly shows that he meant to convey that according to Prophet’s sayings, women will outnumber men in the Paradise.  The famous ḥadīṯ scholar ʾIbn Ḥajar while discussing the issue says:    وَاسْتَدَلَّ أَبُو هُرَيْرَة بِهَذَا الْحَدِيث عَلَى أَنَّ النِّسَاء فِي الْجَنَّة أَكْثَر مِنْ الرِّجَال ... وَهُوَ وَاضِح  ‘‘ ʾĀbu Huraīrah used this Ḥadīṯ as a proof to maintain that women will outnumber men in Ǧannah (paradise) … and this is  much clear. ’’   We run now in some issues with the other narrations, such as the one apparently stating that women will be a majority in Hell. We would say then that they do not present the current state of Hell, and this isn’t something from an apologist fancy, it was stated by Āl-Kašmīrī in his commentary on Ṣaḥīḥ Āl-Buḫārī. The Prophet (ﷺ) stated ‘I was shown the Hell-fire’ and we know from other narration that Prophet (ﷺ) was shown the Hell-Fire on his journey during the miraculous Night of Ascension. So we can easily conclude that the ḥadīṯ indicating women being in majority in the hell refer to the time when the Prophet (ﷺ) actually saw it and they do not mention if same is the case even now. We refer the skeptic to the commentary by Āl-Kašmīrī on those ḥadīṯs.[3]  What about now the other narration that states: ‘Amongst the inmates of Paradise the women would form a minority’? Muḥammad Āl-Manāwī explained this ḥadīṯ saying:   أي في أول الأمر قبل خروج عصاتهن من النار فلا دلالة فيه على أن نساء الدنيا أقل من الرجال في الجنة  “That is initially before the sinful among them coming out of Hellfire. And there is no evidence in this (report) that women of the world are fewer than men in the paradise.”[4]     ʾIbn Ḥajar and Āl-ʿAyni have explained it the same way in their respective commentaries.[5] [6]  We turn now to another issue: ‘Does the Ḥadīṯ forbid women from complaining to their husbands?’ The answer is an empathic: ‘No’. As we know that there is an entire chapter in the Qurʾān (n° 58) which is about a woman who came to the Prophet (ﷺ) to complain against her husband and the Prophet (ﷺ) did not say that she was going to hell for complaining and in fact he listened to her and God also revealed verses addressing the issue and condemning the unacceptable behavior of the husband.     I use the Brill transliteration system, up to errors on my part.  [1] : Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, Ḥadīṯ n° 5062. [2] : ʾIbn Ḥajar, Fatḥ Āl-Bārī, 10/30. [3] : Āl-Kašmīrī, Fayḍ Āl-Bārī, 1/192.

The ahadith are unambiguously worded; as well, given that there are multiple sahih narrations all saying the same thing, you would at least have to acknowledge that a valid interpretation would be that there are more women in hell than in heaven.   And once you acknowledge it's validity, that essentially shows that although perhaps there is some ikhtilaaf on the matter, a strong opinion is that there are more women in hell than in heaven.   To me, that's enough to say that Islam promotes misogyny; if a valid opinion is that women are outnumbering men in the hell fire, simply on account of them being women, even if some scholars were in debate regarding this issue, this has to be complete made-up bullshit."

exmuslim,3daq1r,itistemp,-7,Wed Jul 15 14:10:16 2015 UTC,"It is unauthentic despite the attempts of WikiIslam at making it look so, here's the overall rating offered by A.C. Brown   Moreover, the collection of all the above transmissions, whether or not  they can be accurately traced back to the Prophet or just to a Companion  or other members of the early Muslim community, strongly indicate that  reports were circulating among the first Muslim generations enumerat-  ing several heavenly compensations given to martyrs and including the  companionship of huris. This lies behind al-Albani's decision to rate these  narrations collectively as sahih (al-Albani, Silsilat al-ahadith al-sahiha, 7,  part 1:647-50, no. 3213).   As for the specific number of seventy or seventy-two huris for each  martyr, however, this hinges on the reliability of 1) the narrations via  Bahir, and 2) the solitary narration from Abu Hurayra in al-Tabarani's  works. Bahir's narrations fell victim to Isma'il bin Ayyash's confusion and  are only otherwise known by the unreliable and inaccurate Baqiyya, who  was known to take liberties with precisely such extravagant contents. The  narration from Abu Hurayra collected by al-Tabarani is unreliable due to  the questions surrounding Bakr bin Sahl, its solitary narrator. This collection of evidence does not seem to merit any rating higher than 'weak'  (da'if) for both of the Hadith clusters above.   [...]  See Jami' al-Tirmidhi: kitab fada'il al-jihad, bab thawab al-shahid; Sunan  Ibn Majah: kitab al-jihad, bab fadl al-shaddhafi sabil Allah; Musnad Ahmad  Ibn Hanbal: 4:131; Ibn Abi 'Asim al-Nabil, Kitab al-Jihad, ed. Musa'id  Sulayman al-Hamld, 2 vols (Damascus: Dar al-Qalam, 1989), 2:532-38;  al-Bazzar, Musnad al-Bazzar, 7: 143; al-Tabarani, al-Mu'jam al-kabir, 3:326.   Jonathan A.C. Brown, Misquoting Muhammad, pp. 304-305.   BTW to answer the question of /u/FemaleInfidel: Womens also get equivalent creatures (hur al-ayn) in heaven AFAIK.  EDIT; And here's the entire rating for that matter:   This Hadith has the Prophet promising that,   The martyr receives six features with God: he is immediately for-  given, he sees his seat in Paradise, he is protected from the torment  of the grave and the greatest terror of the Resurrection, he is given  the crown of honor, whose ruby is greater than the world and all in  it; he is given seventy-two heavenly beauties (hur al-'in) as wives  and allowed to intercede on behalf of seventy of his relatives.   This Hadith appears in the Sunans of al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah as well as  the Musnad of Ibn Hanbal and the Musannafoi his teacher 'Abd al-Razzaq  al-San'ani. These sources generally record this Hadith through a number  o[Isnads converging on the Syrian Ismail bin Ayyash and continuing to  his teacher, the widely respected scholar Bahir bin Sa'd, then to Khalid  bin Ma'dan, then continuing to the Prophet via a number of varied chains.  Ismail, however, was well known as a problematic transmitter who,  though he was honest, frequently erred in transmitting Hadiths. He often  confused Isndds or turned Companion opinions into prophetic Hadiths  and vice versa. This is certainly the case for the Hadith of the Seventy-Two  Virgins. Isma'il is recorded as transmitting it via five contrasting paths:    Bahir ← Khalid ← Miqdam bin al-Ma'dikarab ← Prophet  Bahir ← Khalid ← Kathir bin Murra ← 'Ubada bin Samit* ← Prophet  Bahir ← Khalid ← Kathir bin Murra ← Nu'aym bin Hammar (sic) ← Prophet  Bahir ← Khalid ← Kathir bin Murra ← 'Uqba bin 'Amir (not a  prophetic Hadith)  Said bin Yusuf ← Yahya bin Abi Kathir ← Abu Sallam ← Abu Mu'aniq al-Ash'ari ← Abu Malik ← Prophet.    * The narration from 'Ubada was probably a confusion with 'Ubada's separate  narration of a different version of this Hadith, one that lacked specification of seventy-  two heavenly beauties and intercession for seventy relatives; see al-Bazzar, Musnad  al-Bazzar, 7:143.   Amid this confusion of Ismail's varied narrations of the Hadith, there  is only one source that confirms that his teacher Bahir transmitted the  Hadith at all, namely the Hims Hadith scholar Baqiyya bin Walid, who  was generally favored as a source over Isma'il by leading critics such as  Abu Hatim al-Razi.   Baqiyya, though, was just as problematic as Isma'il, meriting unusually lengthy entries in leading Hadith critical dictionaries like the Mizanal-i tidal and the Tahdhib al-Tahdhib. Although he was praised as upstanding and reliable (thiqa) by some leading Hadith critics of the ninth century,  he was more often and more extensively criticized. He was lambasted in particular for narrating unselectively from many transmitters and, much more  seriously, dropping the names of his immediate sources and insinuating that  he received the material from figures earlier in the Isnad(tadlts). Both Ibn  Hanbal and, later, Ibn Hibban al-Bustl engaged in extensive research into  Baqiyya's infractions in this area, expressing great concern and regret for  previous confidence in him. Ibn Hibban observed that 'for less than this  a person loses their upstanding status ( : adala): Both Abu Hatim al-Razi  and the leading Shafi'I jurist and Hadith scholar Ibn Khuzayma declared  Baqiyya unfit for use as proof (hujja), a conclusion that al-Bayhaql later  described as a consensus position. Al-Juzajanl declared that Baqiyya could  not be used as proof if he narrated a report from a source uncorroborated,  and al-Nasa i concluded that he should not be heeded if he did not specify  that he heard material directly from his source.   All of these warnings apply exactly to the Hadith of the Seventy-Two  Virgins. Besides Ismail's confused tangle of narrations, only Baqiyya  transmits the Hadith from Bahir, and he does so by the ambiguous phrase  'from' - not evidence of direct audition. Al-Fasawi observed that one of  Baqiyya's faults was that he enjoyed 'entertaining and bawdy (milah wa  taraif)' - and unreliable - Hadiths too much. Al-Dhahabi called him 'a  man of anomalous, surprising and unacceptable Hadiths' (al-Dhahabi,  Mizan, 1:339; Ibn Hajar, Tahdhib, 1:435-37). Taken together, these  criticisms mean that any narrations coming through Bahlr cannot be  accepted as reliable. \   There is another Hadith cluster with a very similar text narrated from  the Companion Abii Hurayra. It quotes the Prophet as saying:   The martyr is forgiven upon the first shedding of his blood. He is  married to the heavenly beauties and is made an intercessor for  seventy of his family. He who mans a fort on the frontier, if he dies  there, the rewards of all his deeds till the Day of Judgment are written  for him, a breeze comes to him every morning with his sustenance,  he is given seventy Huris as companions, and it is said to him 'Stand  and intercede' until the Hour of Accounting is done.   This Hadith is found in the works of al-Tabaranl {al-Mujam al-kabir, 3:326)  but inspires little confidence. Even the notoriously lax critics al-Suyuti and  al-MunawI only rate it as hasan and weak respectively. The weakest point  in the Isndd is al-Tabarani's own teacher, Bakr bin Sahl, who is criticized  by some as unreliable and as having inexact narrations (muqarib al-hadith)  in the eyes of al-Dhahabi (al-Suyuti, al-Jami' al-saghir, 305, no. 4963;  al-Munawi, Fayd al-qadir, 7:3691-92; al-Dhahabi, Mizdn, 1:345-46).   There are also other versions of this overall tradition that do not include  the specification of seventy-two heavenly beauties and come via chains of  transmission unrelated to those mentioned above; one in the Musnad of  al-Bazzar (7:143) and one in Ibn Hanbal's Musnad (4:200)."

Al-Sabiqoon (the forerunners, the close ones, the first): Their rewards are mentioned in ayat 15-26. They get al-Hoor as mentioned in aya 22, but no gender distinction is mentioned, i.e. no pronouns are used at all whether male or female. It just says Hoor al-'in, the likes of hidden/protected pearls. 'Wide eyed beauties' (look it up google images - it's always women with large eyes).   Then there's the people of the right hand whose rewards are mentioned in ayas 28-37. They get specially created beautiful virgin women of paradise who are their equals. They are not called hoor here, and the female gendered pronouns are explicitly used.  Moving on to Surat al-Rahman (these two surahs are mirrors of each other):  It talks about the rewards of those who fear their Lord in ayas 46 to 58. They get shy virgin women compared in beauty to rubies and coral as in 56-58.  Then it talks about additional rewards for those having Ihsan in ayas 64-76. 70-74 mentions beautiful and good virginal hoor waiting in tents with restraining and modest glances for their husband only.  So uh, sometimes gender pronouns are used sometimes not, but it seems that hoor are in fact always women, since they never have the male pronouns used with them. Also, not all heavenly spouses are hoor. There seems to be different kinds of heavenly women. Hoor, which seem to be the best rewards, and other heavenly spouses, since the distinction and separate mentions are made in the Qur'an repeatedly."

exmuslim,3d94c4,CadmeusCain,5,Tue Jul 14 20:25:55 2015 UTC,"EXCEPT! for the Satanic Verses incident. Then how was Muhammad supposed to know that it wasn't actually Allah but Satan giving him the verses?  As Tabari recounts in Volume 6 under the heading:  Satan Casts a False Revelation on the Messenger of God's Tongue   Al-Qasim b. al-Hasan—al-Husayn b. Daud—Hajja—Abu Ma-'shar—Muhammad b. Ka'b al-Qurazi and Muhammad b. Qays: The Messenger of God was sitting in a large gathering of Quraysh, wishing that day that no revelation would come to him from God which would cause them to turn away from him. Then God revealed:  By the Star when it sets, your comrade does not err, nor is he deceived ...  and the Messenger of God recited it until he came to:  Have you thought upon al-Lat and al-'Uzza and Manat, the third, the other?  when Satan cast on his tongue two phrases:  These are the high flying cranes; verily their intercession is to be desired.  He uttered them and went on to complete the surah. When he prostrated himself at the end of the surah, the whole company prostrated themselves with him. Al-Walid b. al-Mughirah raised some dust to his forehead and bowed over that, since he was a very old man and could not prostrate himself. They were satisfied with what Muhammad had uttered and said, ""We recognize that it is God who gives life and death, who creates and who provides sustenance, but if these gods of ours intercede for us with him, and if you give them a share, we are with you.""   That evening Gabriel came to him and reviewed the surah with him, and when he reached the two phrases which Satan had cast upon his tongue he said, ""I did not bring you these two."" Then the Messenger of God said, ""I have fabricated things against God and have imputed to Him words which He has not spoken."" Then God revealed to him:  And they indeed strove hard to beguile you away from what we have revealed to you, that you should invent other than it against us ...  to the words:  and then you would have found no helper against us.  He remained grief-stricken and anxious until the revelation of the verse:  Never did we send a messenger or a prophet before you ...  to the words  ... God is knower, wise.  When those who had emigrated to Abyssinia heard that all the people of Mecca had accepted Islam, they returned to their clans, saying, ""They are more dear to us""; but they found that the people had reversed their decision when God cancelled what Satan had cast upon the Messenger of God's tongue.   The story is also recounted in the biographies of al-Waqidi, Ibn Saad, al-Tabari, ibn Ishaq and part of it is recounted in Bukhari 6:60:385.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Prophets_and_Kings"
exmuslim,3d94c4,CadmeusCain,2,Tue Jul 14 14:12:50 2015 UTC,I havent really looked into this incident. I like making fun of Islam using verses and hadeeths that they accept are true. Most Muslims on /r/islam dismiss this incident by saying that biographers like Ibn Ishaq just collected everything and didnt bother with checking if something that he's collecting is true or false.
exmuslim,3d94c4,ReinierPersoon,3,Tue Jul 14 14:29:45 2015 UTC,"So here's the thing: when it comes to anything and everything in the Islamic history, we can never know if something is true or not; and we never will be able to know. If you study the 'Science' of Hadith, you'll come to see that most of it is bunk. Note that all Islamic histories are just Hadith.  Some common errors that can occur, do occur and that we might never know have ocurred:    A narration can be poorly attested and deemed weak, but is actually true (Only one person might have been present at the event) A narration can be well attested and deemed strong, but is actually false or distorted (many people believe we only use 10% of our brains. This is false) Something may have happened but no narration of it exists at all (Much of Muhammad's childhood) Something may not have happened but strong narrations exist for it (The Miraj story is a well-attested fabrication)   It's a common apologetic trick that when they don't like a Hadith or narration they find every reason to call it weak or fabricated. And whenever they find a Hadith they do like (e.g. ""Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave"") they accept it even if it turns out to be weak or poorly attested.  Bearing the above in mind, I find little reason to trust those who try to declare the Satanic Verses incident as fradulent; surely they have every reason to try and pretend it never happened. Actually studying the evidence leads me to a different conclusion. Here are some points worth noting:   The narration appears in several different early biographies. In fact, Tabari and Ibn Ishaq are the earliest biographies of Muhammad that exist, so I trust them more than later Islamic scholars. I am skeptical when later biographers claim to know more without strong evidence. The Quran attests in Surah 22:52-53 that Satan has influenced the previous revelations of Messengers and implies that it has happened to Muhammad as well. These verses fit seamlessly into the Satanic Verses narrative   Quran 22:52-53   Never did We send a Messenger or a Prophet before you, but; when he did recite the revelation or narrated or spoke, Shaitan (Satan) threw (some falsehood) in it. But Allah abolishes that which Shaitan (Satan) throws in. Then Allah establishes His Revelations. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise: That He (Allah) may make what is thrown in by Shaitan (Satan) a trial for those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy and disbelief) and whose hearts are hardened. And certainly, the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.) are in an opposition far-off (from the truth against Allah's Messenger and the believers).    Sahih Bukhari makes an oblique reference to the Satanic Verses incident. In the Hadith, it says that the Pagans and the Muslims bowed down together at the revelation of Surah An-Najm (The Star). If you actually read Surah An-Najm, Muhammad insults the Pagan Goddesses and criticizes polytheism thoroughly. It makes no sense that Muhammad would insult their Gods at a time when the Muslims and Pagans are at enmity and then they bow down with him. Considering the Satanic Verses incident, and the account that Surah An-Najm initially favored the Pagan Goddesses, it actually makes sense that they would bow.   Bukhari 6:60:385   Narrated Ibn Abbas: The Prophet performed a prostration when he finished reciting Surat-an-Najm, and all the Muslims and pagans and Jinns and human beings prostrated along with him.    There is also something known as the Criterion of Embarrassment. In simple terms, if an ancient historian records something embarrassing it is more likely to be true. This is because a motivated historian is more likely to keep in the good things and change the bad things when recording history about people they like. (This is why we find accounts of Yazid ibn Muawiyah saying that he was a womanizer, an idiot and a drunkard but we find accounts of Husayn ibn Ali saying he was the nicest man ever). The principle is employed heavily in Biblical studies. When we find really old manuscripts that contain variant verses, and one is problematic for Jesus, it is more likely that a Christian would changed the problematic verse to the nice one, than the nice one to the problematic verse. Likewise, it is more likely that Muslim scholars like Ibn Ishaq or Tabari would have removed the Satanic Incidences event than added it in. Given that it was embarrassing, it is more likely they would have ignored it unless they believed it was true. Indeed, we find later historians got rid of it, likely because it is embarrassing (This criterion is just a rule of thumb, it's not strong evidence).   So bearing all of this in mind, I think it makes a stronger case to believe that the Satanic Verses is more likely to have happened than that it didn't. Can we know for sure? No and we never will. We can't even be sure that Mo really wrote the Quran."

exmuslim,3d94c4,CadmeusCain,2,Tue Jul 14 16:40:11 2015 UTC,"Nobody claims that these people added it. The claim is that they merely ""collected"" these different stories.   Yes but they 'added it' to a collection. Picture yourself in a scenario:  You're collecting Hadith about your grandmother (whom you love very much in this scenario) to build a biography and you go around asking all the people you know to tell you what they know about her. So someone tells you that once she helped them out with their homework and you write that down because you think it's something your nice grandma would do. And then someone tells you that your grandma was a very happy person and was always smiling, so you write that down too. Then someone tells you they once caught your grandmother cheating on her husband with a man half her age. Suddenly you want evidence because that's not at all how you know your grandmother to be and you don't want to include it unless you're absolutely sure.  The analogy is illustrates how Tabari and the early scholars might have thought about Muhammad. They loved this guy, thought he was the prophet of God and everything. A story like the Satanic Verses is disturbing to most Muslims. You can see why they wouldn't want to include it; it goes against their image of Mo. Yet they did; they must have been convinced it was an authentic story."
exmuslim,3d94c4,CadmeusCain,3,Tue Jul 14 16:45:49 2015 UTC,Or the guy who put it in was caught drinking bacon-flavoured vodka and he came up with this story to show that even the prophet could be tempted by the devil.  Your grandma story is pretty much what some of the historical historians did. They wrote down the good deeds of their king or their ancestors and made up shit to fill in the gaps and to make the story better.
exmuslim,3d94c4,utnahpishtim,2,Tue Jul 14 17:26:06 2015 UTC,"but but ...

Yet they did; they must have been convinced it was an authentic story.   No he was were pretty clear that he was only ""collecting"" stuff.

exmuslim,3d94c4,safi_Ibn_sayyad,-2,Tue Jul 14 17:23:15 2015 UTC,"The story has been absolutely rejected by all scholars,  Ibn Kathir said; ‘All the links of this Tradition are unauthentic and I have found no correct version of this with continuous links.’ (Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir 5/441-442)  Shaukani says, ‘There is nothing true in it and none of its links is proved.’ (Fath al-Qadeer 5/128)  Ibn Jawzi says: ‘This is not correct.’ (Zaad al-Muyassar 4/391)  When Ibn Khuzaimah was asked about it, he said, ""This story has been invented by heretics"". (Tafsir al-Raazi 11/134)  Baihaqi said; ""This story has not been proved to be correct by the rules of reporting"". (Tafsir a-Raazi 11/135)  Qazi `Ayad says, ""The very fact that this tradition is neither contained in any of the authentic collections of Hadith nor has it been related in an authentic way by authentic reporters shows its weakness"". (Al-Shifa 2/125)  Besides them, Imam Razi (in his Tafsir 11/135), Qazi Abu Bakr Ibn al-`Arabi (Al-Shifa 2/126), Alusi (in his Tafsir 13/99) etc. have rejected it altogether. The fact that it appears in Tarikh al-Tabari or other collections doesn't mean anything since they only transmitted the story:   Let him who examines this book of mine know that I have relied, as regards everything I mention therein which I stipulate to be described by me, solely upon what has been transmitted to me by way of reports which I cite therein and traditions which I ascribe to their narrators, to the exclusion of what may be apprehended by rational argument or deduced by the human mind, except in very few cases. This is because knowledge of the reports of men of the past and of contemporaneous views of men of the present do not reach the one who has not witnessed them nor lived in their times except through the accounts of reporters and the transmission of transmitters, to the exclusion of rational deduction and mental inference. Hence, if I mention in this book a report about some men of the past, which the reader of listener finds objectionable or worthy of censure because he can see no aspect of truth nor any factual substance therein, let him know that this is not to be attributed to us but to those who transmitted it to us and we have merely passed this on as it has been passed on to us.

exmuslim,3d83i3,Modokon,6,Tue Jul 14 13:53:39 2015 UTC,"You know, when I was younger I tried to figer out how the stuff should work in hell.   Here are some conclusions I reached:     1. Hell will have us in it. That means that:        The laws of physics are similar to our laws of physics (because if fundamental constants were different, we couldn't exist. Either gravity would be too strong, nuclear or electrostatic forces would be too weak or strong, etc. So all laws of physics should be the same as in our universe)        We will burn. That again is pretty significant because combustion requires oxidant. In our case (and probably hell) that oxidant  is oxygen, which itself HAS TO BE RENEWABLE. Yes, boys and girls, that means vegetation. And probably a whole new species which brings me to my next point:        Devils, imps and all that shit. Not only hell would have unique life (and for me as biochemist that is a dealbreaker; i want there NOW) but this life WOULD BE SENTIENT. These creatures would be perfectly aware of their surroundings, they COULD THINK, USE TOOLS, PROBABLY EVEN HAVE THEIR OWN CULTURE.  Do you think any species like that would mindlessly torture people? This is hell we're talking about, not North Korea.   2. All and ever non-muslim who ever lived will be in hell:    Seneca, Aristotle, Socrates and all other philosophers I want to have a drink with :)    Spartacus, Leonidas, Churchill and all the other great leaders who ever have lived would be there together. You think they would submit and be slaves? i think we would see Spartacus and marcus Craxus fighting hand in hand FOR FREEDOM andd Leonidas giving a speech to all the Spartacus, something like ""When I died, they made legends about me and 300 Spartans. Not look across this plane, look at the armies of hell... They heard stories about 300 Spartans making an Army of a million Persians run in fear. And yet now they are looking at all the Spartans who have ever lived, with fear gripping their hearts""   We would have people like Von Braun and Carl Sagan and all the other Great Scientists who have ever lived. They would also have people like Steve Jobs. Can you imagine discussion between jobs and Satan? ""You can either stay here with few of your devils and be forever in shadow of this Allah guy or you can join us and be part of something great""   And finally we would have Lenin leading his communist revolution in hell. Can you imagine little imps protesting for 8 hour work day, social guarantees and free healthcare?"

exmuslim,3d8yo6,So-Done,5,Tue Jul 14 12:54:07 2015 UTC,"So here's the thing. I'm quite interested in thinking clearly so I study propaganda, literature and fallacies in my spare time. But these aren't equally heinous everywhere. For instance: telling your friend ""you always screw up!"" is a generalization fallacy but it would be a bit bizarre for your friend to call you out on this.  Most of the techniques you've mentioned are also fallacies (erroneous forms of thinking or presenting information). A fallacy in a conversation is as fallacious as a fallacy in a debate, but where the rules aren't as strict, they matter less. Here on this forum, we aren't having structured debates, writing academic papers or trying to persuade people. We're mostly ranting, sharing things and having conversations. In this social context, fallacies matter less. I'm pretty sure that when someone on this forum says: ""Why are Muslims so violent?"" they don't literally mean that every Muslim int he world is violent.  I think the important thing is also that we aren't trying to convert anyone. Almost everyone who posts in this forum is either already an ex-Moose or is an annoying Muslim trying to stir the pot. I think very few people on this forum go out and perform reverse-Dawah. Occasionally someone on the fence shows up and asks questions, in which case the forum tends to offer more information and less propaganda.  I agree with you entirely that fallacies are dangerous (most of what you've described are fallacies), but I don't think that propaganda itself is bad. If you merely define propaganda as spreading information to promote a cause, then I'm ok with propaganda against racism or propaganda for vaccine usage. I'm not ok with dishonesty however.  But I think the general point you're trying to convey is that, rather than being persuaded by one side, a fair person should look at different sides of the argument and recognize persuasion techniques. Sure, I agree."

I went on my first date with my girlfriend and we found that we both like each other and wanted to go on a second one. Before we went on a second date, I told her we needed to have a serious talk. I told her how my life was in the past and how it is now. I told her my feelings for my parents (fucking hate them), and my feelings for Islam (the shittiest of all religions). Then I told her about my plans for the future. She said that it will only be a few months in which she would have to put up with my shitty situation and then when I leave for good, life will be better.   By telling her up front, it built something in our relationship in which that she knows that I want her in my life and she wants me in hers. It also is respectful to my girlfriend that I can tell her my problems that could be a hindrance to the longevity of our relationship.

Here's what I think:  Yes. It will be hard. You won't be able to be in a relationship the way you want. I can't sleep over at my boyfriend's house, we can't go out with his friends to clubs/bars/etc without me having to leave early and/or getting anxiety (not in that order necessarily). So yes, it is hard. And to be honest, my relationship with him has kind of reached a wall where we can't really move further in our relationship unless/until I move out, come out to my parents, or otherwise change my situation. BUT it's not impossible. We're still together, it's just hard and sometimes it feels like all this stress and tension from my side of things is eroding away the good parts of our relationship. So in that sense, maybe wait? But at the same time, why wait when you can start building something now, and then once your situation changes you already have that something/somebody and you know you've already gone through hell with that person by your side.

For many of us, we are forced to define ourselves by what we don't believe. Our parents and family members have either turned on us, or will turn on us if we tell them what we don't believe.

We just want to live ordinary lives and do and believe what we want. In 99% of our cases here, that option isn't available to us because of how much Muslims will not accept apostates.

exmuslim,3d8crv,thoroughbred_ofsin,5,Tue Jul 14 08:25:49 2015 UTC,"A couple of specific points- masturbating?! Really? People are expected to not masturbate EVER?   Nothing in the quran forbids masturbation. Some branches of Islam tolerate it, especially if it prevents one from commiting a sin.   Why does it seem like people worship Mohammed more so than they do Allah?   That is a very unislamic thing to do, but then again probably not the only unislamic thing Muslims do   Islam in general is so vastly disrespectful to women...   Well the Quran places the woman at 1/2 a mans's worth when it comes to inheritance and when it comes to being a witness. So it is a natural step to take to place a woman at half the man's worth, period. Especially since other places in the Quran place her worth less than his.  One thing you need to understand though: Is you can be a Christian without believing the Bible is the literal word of god. Actually with all the modern Biblical scholarship that has been done, all but fundamental Christians do... but you cannot be a Muslim without believing the Quran is the literal word of god.   You can do a bit of handwaving when it comes the sun setting in a fountain and say it is metaphoric or the legality of owning sex slaves doesn't really apply today and so on, but you still can't deny the Quran being the literal word of god and still call yourself a Muslim... and that's why you get a lot of the all or nothing stand"
exmuslim,3d8crv,Molotova,3,Tue Jul 14 10:21:41 2015 UTC,"Don't be prejudiced against Muslims simply for their religion ( unless they do something to deserve your disrespect , like if your friend forced his sister to wear a hijab or wtv ) , few people will understand what years of childhood indoctrination will do to you and how difficult it is to get out of Islam once you buy into that reality.  You are allowed to masturbate in some occasions. For ex -  if you believe that not masturbating will lead you to committing the sin of 'zina' ( unlawful sexual intercourse)   However, this is in cases of absolute emergency.   Ritual impurity rarely makes someone feel that they are 'unclean' or 'impure'  If men ejaculate they are impure too.  Islam treats things like blood , jizz , shit , urine , dog saliva , the 40 days after child birth etc as being inherently impure or 'najis'. Most Muslims just accept it as such and understand that ritual impurity and not being allowed to pray is different from being impure.  In fact the verse about women not being allowed to pray during menstruation was revealed in the context that certain Jewish sects used to keep their women in isolation when they were bleeding, because they were 'unclean' and when this was revealed the Jews shouted ""by God you are trying to oppose us in everything !! ""  Atleast that's what I read in a tafsir anyway. I'm sure some Muslim women feel they are 'impure' during this period ..but that's not really an Islamic attitude.   In fact Aisha used to sleep on mo's lap and mo used to kiss her and fondle her and stuff , only sex was not allowed.  And the puppy thing .. Again Islam allows people to have dogs as pets as long as its for hunting or as guard dogs. Touching a dog isn't against Islam or anything.   The only thing Islam is against is keeping dogs as pets inside your homes ( you need to build a kennel outside)  and you have to take a bath* after you touch dog saliva else your prayers won't be accepted and well dogs lick themselves everywhere except the forehead so some scholars say you don't need to take that bath if you're touching only the foreheads.   Edit : And as for the Mohammad thing. Mo told everyone that you aren't a true believer unless you love mo more than you love everyone else in the world."

The Maliki madhab says that the saliva of the dog is not unclean, while the other three major madahab say that it is, which means that you just have to clean the spot they lick.

Obviously there are exceptions, and I found one in the comments:   Focus on being a better person rather than focusing on little quirks like whether the vanilla extract in cake is haraam or how many fist-lengths your beard should be.   If all Muslims were like this, I'd still be a Muslim."

The guard dogs scared the shit of Muhammad or bark at him when he stealthy visit his target in the middle of the night.

I knew I couldn't move out while I'm still a student because that would just be way too much stress.   I view moving out as a double-edged sword, but really, it's the lesser of two evils.  On the one hand, yes, I do get my freedom, I get to do whatever I want, whenever I want without having to answer the ""do you even pray?"" question that's become more and more frequent. On the other, it's going to be a very difficult time in my life and one kind of suffering is going to be replaced by another. Instead of feeling restricted by my parents'/religion's rules, I'm going to be restricted by the fact that I am going to  be living alone without my sisters (who are younger than I am and whom I love so dearly), and without my parents -- specifically my mom -- who although I disagree with them on many things, I love so much.   I also know how much hurt is going to occur within my family and that makes me so nervous/scared because I want to stay strong and stick to my plan, but I'm also worried that if I were to see my mom bed-ridden or sick because of my news (which is entirely possible... she has some medical issues already), I'd feel so guilty and responsible.   I just have to remind myself that that ISN'T my responsibility. I am only truly responsible for myself an it's not like I'm intentionally hurting anybody. I am just trying to look out for myself and hurt myself less.   This is all so tough to navigate really. Good luck with your plan! (What is your plan? You're so young!)"

I also wish I were born into a different family and that's a thought I've had since I was young. I don't remember quite what it was my parents were telling me (because I never really cared to listen too much to religious stuff) but I think I had asked them if people who have never come into contact with Islam (secluded tribes, indigenous people, etc.) would still be punished for being non-muslim. And my parents replied that because Islam never reached them, they wouldn't be judged by how good of muslims they are but rather by how good they were as people and if they lived morally. So from then on I would always think ""if only I had been born into a family that never came in contact with Islam just so I could be judged on whether or not I'm a good person rather than whether or not I'm a good Muslim.""   Now I just wish I hadn't been born into this family because I love them dearly, but I don't want to hurt them. But their hurt is not going to be my fault, whereas my hurt IS their fault. They're the ones imposing their beliefs/religion on me. I won't be imposing anything on anybody just asking to be accepted! (But I am already telling my younger sisters that they can think for themselves... I still feel guilty sometimes for influencing them away from Islam but really, one of them is still holding on to it and that's her choice, whereas the other ... well she reminds me of me.

You see, when these hadiths are alluding to Muhammad writing letters or marriage contracts it is of course not referring to him literally actually physically writing them, and here's why:  If you look at the ancient arabic meaning of ""أكتب"", which means ""To write"", you can see this word has many different connotations. Therfore it can easily be taken in a metaphorical sense since the Arabic language is so vast and complicated with it's linguistic elegance.

I do not think anyone here is a hadith scholar to give us the contextual background as well as let us know how the Arabic in the original hadith was used during that time (since certain words and phrases might have different meaning during that time period, but now have different connotations/interpretations.)  Yes, this argument can be used for everything pretty much, but the more I look into things, the more I realize context really is important, especially when it comes to hadith."
exmuslim,3d6ey0,ploidZero,2,Tue Jul 14 07:07:06 2015 UTC,"Other than the word Ummi, one only need to know the very first aaya of Quran revealed to Mo in Cave Hira by Angel Gabriel.   اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ Read: In the name of thy Lord Who createth, [96:1]  And read the corresponding context of revelation as has been propagated by muslims throughout the last 14 centuries that he did not know how to read.  Then, maybe it was his personal insecurity about not being able to read that prompted him to utter these words while being high on chanting in Cave Hira. His contemporaries knew he was illiterate and used to make fun of him. Why God would choose an illiterate over us educated? Now, two centuries later, when Hadith collectors saw Mo as he was, they found him lacking a basic skill. I mean, these guys who are writing Hadith are literate and the Prophet they choose to follow is anything but. So, they made few Hadith here and there to give the impression that he was literate but still maintain the tradition that he was not in other places.   Inconsistencies, average muslims don't bother themselves with. They KNOW it is true. How do they know it? THEY JUST DO."

I don't think his literacy has anything to do with him having the capacity to invent or not invent the Quran. All I'm trying to do is that the narrative that ""Muhammad was illiterate"" has objections to it from within the Hadith.   From my school years I remember that the Quran was written on paper only after his death.   Yep. The historic accounts conflict somewhat. Some say it was Abu Bakr who compiled the Codex at Umar's behest and it was then kept with Hafsa. Others say it was Uthman with a group of four people including Zaid ibn Thabit. There are also many records of a dispute with Ibn Masud, who Muhammad appointed as the best teacher of the Quran during his lifetime.   he used to just say it and his friends used to memorize it immediately (maybe write it somewhere). Is this correct or just some scholar nonsense I learned in school?   I don't know actually. Some of the accounts I've read say that people memorized parts of the Quran, others say that those who knew the entire Quran was a limited number. But there is further evidence from within the Hadith that Muhammad forgot verses, as well as his companions. In particular, one of the things that prompted the early Muslims to write down the Quran was the vast number of Hafiz that were dying during the wars the Caliphs were fighting.   It is highly likely that parts of the Quran were lost. One of the more famous referencs to this comes from Sahih Muslim:  Sahih Muslim 2286   Abu Musa al-Ash’ari sent for the reciters of Basra. They came to him and they were three hundred in number. They recited the Qur’an and he said: You are the best among the inhabitants of Basra, for you are the reciters among them. So continue to recite it. (But bear in mind) that your reciting for a long time may not harden your hearts as were hardened the hearts of those before you. We used to recite a surah which resembled in length and severity to (Surah) Bara’at. I have, however, forgotten it with the exception of this which I remember out of it: “If there were two valleys full of riches, for the son of Adam, he would long for a third valley, and nothing would fill the stomach of the son of Adam but dust.” And we used to recite a surah which resembled one of the surahs of Musabbihat, and I have forgotten it . . .   No such Surah which mentions two valleys of riches appears in the Quran."

I also have the Book of Mormon, the Bhagavad Gita and the Apocrypha which I plan to read in the future. I regular read and study as much about different religions as I can.  Having studied so many religions, especially the Abrahamic Faiths (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) it really is hard to take any of them seriously. We know with a high degree of certainty how they developed over time and how they were invented. For instance, we know that the story of Noah is actually a retelling of the Babylonian Flood Myth that the Jews stole and rebranded. A version of it appears in the Epic of Gilgamesh which is over 5000 years old.  The more you study religions the more you realize that they're man-made inventions.

exmuslim,3d6c38,lirannl,6,Tue Jul 14 04:31:06 2015 UTC,"Advice from a non-ex-muslim and no-muslim.   The vast majority of people in this sub-reddit turn to atheism, which in my opinion is not a good or a bad thing.   The most important aspects of living on Earth, even if you believe or not in a higher force, is to learn how to love your fellow humans, ""believers"" and ""un-believers"" alike. It may sound like empty words but the best in things in life come out of love: having a functional family, a group of friends that will support you, and the satisfaction you didn't spent your time on Earth in vane. The next step is to learn that humanity has a lot of nice things to offer you, arts, science, just as much you have nice things to offer to humanity.  If you want to continue to keep G-d in your life, you can develop your own religious path in concordance with respect for life and the dignity of the individuals. Don't assume that religions are like corporate procedures where you have to do thing A, then get to thing B in order to obtain thing C. You need to understand that you cannot bribe your way into the ""heavens"" if you are doing things blindly, without using your brain.  Your choices:    Sufism  Before turning your back to Islam, you can start learning about Sufism. I consider the Sufi interpretation of Islam so far away from what mainstream Islam is preaching that you can consider a whole different religion.  Some Sufi quotes really like:   Happy are those who find fault with themselves instead of finding fault with others.   or   Whatever we perceive in the world around us tends to reflect who we are and what we care about most deeply, as in the old saying, ""When a thief sees a saint, all he sees are his pockets.""   or    I saw my Lord with the eye of the heart. I said, “Who are you.” He said, “You.”   or   Do you think that you aren’t free? You are free, but you do not know that you are free—and it is your not knowing that you are free that is your limitation and your imprisonment. Realize your freedom, and you are free.   ^ The last quote should describe very well the epiphany that ex-muslims have after they realize that the cage is broken and that they can freely start to explore the world as it is: full of saints and kafirs.     Christianity  Christianity has gone through serious changes throughout the ages. There are a multitude of denominations, from stupid mis-guided extremists, to people who really wish to live on Earth following the example of Jesus, which was a cool and revolutionary guy for his age. He was one of the first thinkers saying people to love their enemies, to make peace on earth and to build harmony.  Of course, the Church doesn't always reflect the level of enlightenment Jesus had, but in Christian communities around the globe you will be able to find one of the nicest people you will ever meet.    Judaism  Judaism seems to be very close to Islam on the surface and regarding the practices, but the inner is very different.  Jews believe in a thing called Tikkun Olam which means that we must heal the world. So, life on Earth has a higher meaning when compared to Islam. Life on Earth is in a way more important than the ""afterlife"". We are here on Earth, G-d gave a mission to humans to repair a broken world by bringing peace and harmony.   Also, compared to the majority of Christian denominations, Jews are truly monotheistic, and just like muslims they say: There is no god but Allah (without the part involving Mohammed).    Baha'i  This is a newer and all-inclusive religion. The followers are usually smart people who were not born in it, but chose to become Baha'i by themselves. This means that the level of hypocrisy is lesser than in other religions.    Good luck on your spiritual enquirers. As long as you learn to respect the ones around you, you won't fail."
exmuslim,3d6c38,nomemory,2,Mon Jul 13 22:48:52 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to reply on your details about Christianity.  I think it's important to clarify that you're talking about Protestant Christians since they're the ones with over 30,000 denominations.  Catholic Christians however are the first and original Christians who have not changed and have been teaching and understanding scripture in unity for over 2,000 years now.  It's important to know that Non-Catholics are the ones constanly trying to change and misinterpret scripture to their own personal whims, which is why there is so much division and a constant growing of denominations in Protestantism ever since Martin Luther started the reformation about 500 years ago.  Martin Luther himself regretted the protest movement after he saw the division it caused towards the end of his life.  Supposedly he wanted to confess on his death bed and become Catholic again but one of his close Lutheran followers denied his request.  Anyway in Protestant Christianity, it's common that some random guy goes and creates his own sect simply because he does not agree with any other Protestant denomination.  It's a very flawed system that contradicts itself heavily.  You don't see that in Catholicism.  All Catholics teach and understand their faith in unity and have been doing so for over 2,000 years.  Anyway, I thought it was important to make that distinction.  If OP is looking into many religions, I think it's important that he knows what is going on in the side of Christianity.  If it so happens he begins to choose Christianity, which is common for many ex-muslims, I highly recommend he choose the orignal source of Christianity which is Catholicism."
exmuslim,3d6c38,GGodHand,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:05:24 2015 UTC,"Catholicism is still quite conservative and dogmatic. Liberal schools of Christianity do tend to be Protestant, although extremists and scriptural fundamentalists are Protestants, too. Protestant just means non-Catholic/Orthodox. I think for a liberal-minded person who is seeking spiritual nourishment, something like Episcopalianism, Methodism or Quakerism might seem more welcoming;and while these emerged from the Protestant movement indirectly in some way, they are well-established denominations and societies that are inclusive and have a strong social message. (And in Northern Europe, the national Protestant churches tend to be similarly inclusive, and socially minded.)"

All abhramic religions are the same and were created for the same purpose: to maintain control over the sheep.  You need a purpose in life, you can have that without religion.

exmuslim,3d6c38,LeiningensAnts,2,Tue Jul 14 13:45:05 2015 UTC,"If you are searching for a way of life outside of religion, have a look at stoicism. It's a philosophy.   The Stoics taught that destructive emotions resulted from errors in judgment, and that a sage, or person of ""moral and intellectual perfection"", would not suffer such emotions.[1]  Stoics were concerned with the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, and the belief that it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy as a way of life, and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how that person behaved.  Following Socrates, the Stoics held that unhappiness and evil are the results of human ignorance of the reason in nature. If someone is unkind, it is because they are unaware of their own universal reason, which leads to the conclusion of kindness. The solution to evil and unhappiness then, is the practice of Stoic philosophy—to examine one's own judgments and behavior and determine where they diverge from the universal reason of nature.  Philosophy for a Stoic is not just a set of beliefs or ethical claims, it is a way of life involving constant practice and training (or askesis, see asceticism). Stoic philosophical and spiritual practices included logic, Socratic dialogue and self-dialogue, contemplation of death, training attention to remain in the present moment (similar to some forms of Eastern meditation), and daily reflection on everyday problems and possible solutions. Philosophy for a Stoic is an active process of constant practice and self-reminder.   The stoics assumed that the universe itself is divnity. This belief is also known as pantheism (and it's absolutely haram). So if you hurt another person, you are basically hurting a (unaware) part of ""God"". The only divine laws are the universal laws of cause and effect (""fate""), laws of physics, etc. There are no divine laws which want to control the lifestyle of a human, no supernatural judge, no divine interventions (earthquakes when God gets angry), and no personal God with human characteristics.   All people are manifestations of the one universal spirit and should, according to the Stoics, live in brotherly love and readily help one another.

The fact that you are thinking that this makes no sense is the first step in freeing yourself from religion.  The pork issue was relevant 2500 years ago...not much nowadays with modern food regulations.   As far of what religions to identify with.

Honestly its just too much and more so because I don't actually believe in it. I remember my mum would tell me that girls are all evil and you should stay away from them. I was like wtf  I don't have many muslim friends and not that embedded within the Islamic community so its okay I guess. I probably have to move city in order to live my life freely though. Im lucky that my parents don't force me to go to the mosque that's only because my parents are anti social and like to stick to themselves.  What major are you doing , if you don't mind me asking ?"

exmuslim,3d7kai,tbelcherisbae,3,Tue Jul 14 04:06:02 2015 UTC,"My parents believe in black magic n shit and are really superstitious like don't leave your shoes flipped or something bad gonna happen. Don't get my started on the jewish conspiracy theories , gays , girls who wear skirts , dirty white kaffirs , the evil entertainment industry. Its just sad that they believe in this stuff. Honestly I feel sorry for them, that they are all brainwashed.  I never really understood praying , even when I was younger my parents would ask me to pray and all I did was just put my hands together randomly and just go along with it. Luckily I didn't have to recite anything but rather do it in my head lol which made it easier  Neuroscience sounds kool. Im doing commerce which is alrite I guess"
exmuslim,3d7kai,tbelcherisbae,4,Tue Jul 14 04:48:58 2015 UTC,"I haven't actually left yet but am in the process of making arrangements to leave at the end of the year. I'm 17, btw, and also in Australia. You're actually very lucky you live in Australia, you will have very few struggles (not including emotional) moving out.   First off, get your Centrelink allowance sorted- you're under 21 and if you move out you'll be an independent, making you eligible for about $520 per fortnight. Next, it's super duper easy to find a place, I'd suggest you don't be on the lease as that's usually more complicated and more expensive, so hop on this fantastic website and you'll find a place to share with other people in no time, and usually it's as simple as checking out the place and meeting the people one time, and then moving in within a few days. Most of the really nice places won't be more than $200 per week and a lot of them include bills, so the Centrelink allowance should cover rent, but if the rent is more than about $150 (forgot the exact number) you're also eligible for Centrelink rent assistance :) Basically the fact that you live in Australia means you don't need to worry majorly about expenses but I'd still look for a job asap because you can expect anything your parents currently fund for you to be cut off- so you need to think about your mobile and health insurance bills, etc.  The social skills bit I really really would not worry about, I used to be super socially awkward as well cause I was never allowed out etc but as soon as I got a job and started uni I picked up on it really quickly. Honestly, just put yourself out there and do things that make you really uncomfortable at first and you get used to it. Doing things that are challenging for you is really rewarding, too. If you find that you're still really anxious around people after that, it may be an issue of social anxiety and you could talk to someone about it, but from what it sounds like it's just lack of experience leading to nerves, so I think getting yourself out there will do the trick.   I wish you the best of luck, friend! I genuinely think you will be fine and you'll find independence and freedom to be liberating, refreshing and exciting. Keep us updated xx"
exmuslim,3d7kai,I-PwNz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:12:47 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks for taking the time to type out that reply , I really appreciate it. I know im very lucky to live in Australia , I sometimes shudder at the thought of being born and living in a muslim country. Bless Australia   I have already sorted out the centrelink allowance so its all good. The bit I am most worried about is getting a job. Do you have any advice ? I have tried submitting my applications in at all major outlets like supermarkets and target and tried some online websites but I always get no reply. I have also done some volunteering at the local op shop as well in order to fill out my CV but it still looks pretty bare. Do you any other tips ? Apparently vic youth employment is at 10 % so idk. My dad doesn't allow me to use a phone , so I guess I don't have to worry about phone bills lol  My socials skills are so poor. Honestly I just feel like I have wasted the past 19 yrs of my life. I see other kids dating , partying and shit and I feel like at the bottom honestly its so miserable. I remember this white dude sat down next to me and tried to initiate a conversation and I didn't know what to say so I just panicked and left. Felt so embarrassed and ashamed afterwards. I cant even carry a conversation.  I guess your right you do have to start uncomfortable and slowly get used to it. I talked to some other guy though on Friday for like 2 mins and kinda went well I think lol.   Anyways thanks for the tips ! I appreciate it"
exmuslim,3d7kai,magich,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:43:26 2015 UTC,"Hey no worries man :) Umm do you mean submitted applications online? That never ever ever works. It's actually not as hard as you might think to get a job, but try applying at the smaller, privately owned places. My best tip (how I got my job and several other offers) would be to print off maybe 25 copies of your resume and then just spend a whole day dropping them off at places. Like I said though, try the smaller places. You have a much higher chance of getting the job and they usually don't exploit their workers with minimum wage as much. For your CV really just milk all of your experience as much as you can; my resume was pretty bare as well but I hyped a lot of things up lol. If you PM me I could probably copy paste mine to give you an idea of what I mean, I also only had volunteer work so it might be helpful to you?   Haha you'd still need to worry about phone bills. Life on your own will be very tough without a mobile and it's pretty affordable so I'd look into it.  It's okay don't think about the time you've wasted, you're still young, you have your whole life ahead of you to get out there and make a ton of friends! Dude I wish you lived in my state hahaha after we're both all done with the moving out process I could introduce you to heaps of people :) See okay next time you're in a situation like that force yourself to stay and maintain conversation. Or just strike up conversations with people around you as often as you can. It can actually be really fun :)"

exmuslim,3d7cx3,umeedesehar,5,Tue Jul 14 03:06:10 2015 UTC,"So I don't know about you. But I am fairly impressed by your mom's composure for as long as she held on. Such a parent is not common.   She made honest attempts to meet you on your playing field. You also have to remember that while you have been exposed to thorough anti-Islam arguments, your mom on the other hand doesn't regularly visit a subs or websites that work on debunking or answering these types of questions.   Just being side lined with something like, disbelief is a tremendously devastating experience for a parent. In that state of mind it's difficult for them to not use their authority sincr anger, confusion, disappointment, shock, and over all being dumbfounded by the situation, are all an emotional response. Your mom handled it pretty well IMO.   Hug your mom next time you see her alone and thank her for being a great mother.   Future advice: when your mom tells you that she is open for advice, don't be so arrogant to her face and say, you already got it under control or thanks but no thanks. Tell her ""sure mom, you are my mother and I'll always approach you like I always have in the past"".   Please do not close avenues for discussion. You parents will always think to they know what's best for you, it's a parent thing. So oblige her when she wants to start a conversation. Closing avenues of discourse will only make her think more about the situation and let her thoughts brew in a negative way.   Do not flaunt your disbelief every chance you get.   Do not make absolutist statements. Leave them open ended. Like ""I'm still learning and what not, I may not believe right now, but you need to let me find the truth on my own with out over bearing me""  or something close to that but keep boundaries of respect.   I only say these things so the remainder of your time with your family, though may not be smooth but these little things might make it bearable for both you and your parents. Good luck on your journey."
exmuslim,3d7cx3,Twiceadopted,3,Tue Jul 14 09:03:06 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert but this sounds like this anger is stemming from the ""life and career choices"" discussion that you referenced.  My suggestion is to just roll with the punches and pretend to be Muslim while simultaneously choosing your life and career path independently from Islam or your parents.

If you try to push it now, they might go a little crazy. Also, I'm going to assume your father doesn't know yet, and if your father is anything like mine I would strongly suggest you don't make it seem serious enough to your mother that she'd need to consult your dad about it.. For now at least. Like I said, until you have a place to go. Better safe than sorry. Good luck :)"

It's a lot easier for fundamentalists to be taken seriously when their women look like something non-human. If people kept the fact that underneath that black shroud there is just another female human in their minds… perhaps it will be easier to criticize idiotic Islamic beliefs. I'm 100% convinced that the niqab gives Muslims a sort of free-pass because they look so different from normal humans. It's a visual trick which screws with peoples minds. It forces people to assume they are dealing with ""Muslims""… a weird species, instead of just other humans who need to be brought back to fucking reality and taught how to behave.   Uniforms exist for a reason. They have a huge psychological impact, and the niqab IS a uniform."

The purpose of magicians to do these actions is to make contact with the devils that leads to some sort of physical manifestation.

Historian most often attribute Abraham(as) to be from the Sumerian civilization, if he was a real figure, keeping personal belief out ofcourse.   Recently I've stumbled across a Quranic claim regarding Abraham(as). It's difficult to prove things when they've happens thousands of years ago. But as soon as Ramadan is over, I would jump back on that track.   Anu is the son of a 2 primordial Gods. Annunanki is a group of dieties. Anu is referred to father of all Gods as well.   Now I personally do not think that pose is depicting Qiyam. Though it would be interesting to read up more in it and find out about why most of his statues have hands resting on chest. The logic of arms on hands would mean he is praying. Being the father of Gods, who would he the Godhead be praying to. Was it his parents? Or the parents of his parents. Would there be literature on who Anu prayed to. I would be looking for some sort of understanding of the way and form Anu worshipped in. Would this form be the same for the believers of Anu etc.   Definitely looking forward to getting into Sumerian, Mesopotamian texts."

Part of the reason why I married my wife was because I believed that she was a snowflake..She was a 3rd year aalima when I met her and she dressed like a nice pious muslim lady EXACTLTY what i wanted at the time she always greated me with a Great asallamualakum and made me belive that she was a snowflake.....Queue to this year april when I found out that she done stuff with guys before me....some serious stuff to me as I was never with anyone else before her...To say that I was devestated is an understatement...HOWEVER with time it gets better..I had deep anger because i felt she Lied to me..She lied via ommision because she Knew exactly what she done and said to me all these years. It was via some coincidence that this came out...I was mad as hell...But you know what, life gets better and I have learnt to deal with it...I have learnt that its life and these things happen.....  Why am i telling you this?????  Maybe because I can see myself and my wife in your situation..If my wife had to tell me what she done before we married I would have never had married her....But she kept her mouth closed and I MADE the assumption that she was a snowflake because of alll the outward factors.....  Will there be issues..Most definatly..Will he be pissed OH YEAH...will he accecpt it maybe maybe not...It all depends on many factors and time will tell how it all plays out...  You have no other option and if he is a good human being he will understand...I have come to understand and have come to forgive my wife....I am sure he may be able to as well....."

Marrying him sounds like a good way for your parents to allow you out of Iran, but I wouldn't do it unless he is aware of your situation and the fact that you've entered the marriage with the intention of divorce.

So he would have to be ok with you being gay cuz otherwise he will divorce you and u will go back to iran unless you claim asylum and there's no way to tell if u will get it or not. The best way would probably be to   1) marry him and find a lesbian GF which you can marry later  or  2) get a job in a field where they need people so that you can stay after the divorce  I REALLY BELIEVE WE EX MOOSE SHOULD SET UP A DATING NETWORK FOR EXACTLY THAT REASON."

Islam doesn't understand borders, it is like a cancer and even your typical ex-Muslim here, is a cancer merchant.  Without agreeing to keep yourself to yourself, you basically force me to plan for war against you. You're a threat. A horrible, cancerous threat.  This was the first thing I challenged my mum on, why couldn't Muhammed leave the Meccans well enough alone? Why conquer them? Why do Muslims have to go everywhere? Why does Allah want people who don't believe, to be conquered rather than left alone?  That's the most evil part of Islam, the Muslim cancer."

Because in Islamic country we are minority and we can't talk against Islam. But we knew Islam has some short fall. 1. Muhammad spread Islam with sword, Quran and sword go hand in hand.  2. Muhammad asked muslims to hate non muslims or convert them forcively. 3. Mohammad's stories are almost same as many other religious leaders stories and there is nothing superb about it. They all are full of imaginary stuff. My family was very liberal and we are always taught to respect people as human, nit because they are muslim or Christian or hindu. Now after 30 years  I see muslims who are losing faith and talking stuff what we realized and understood 30 years back.

They were brought out to him in groups. Among them were the enemy of God, Huyayy b. Akhtab, and Ka’b b. Asad, the head of the tribe. They numbered 600 or 700—the largest estimate says they were between 800 and 900. As they were being taken in groups to the Messenger of God, they said to Ka’b b. Asad, “Ka’b, what do you understand. Do you not see that the summoner does not discharge [anyone] and that those of you who are taken away do not come back? By God, it is death!” the affair continued until the Messenger of God had finished with them.[3] [Tabari, Volume 8, Victory of Islam, p. 35-36]    Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: The people of (Banu) Quraiza agreed to accept the verdict of Sad bin Mu'adh. So the Prophet sent for Sad, and the latter came (riding) a donkey and when he approached the Mosque, the Prophet said to the Ansar, ""Get up for your chief or for the best among you."" Then the Prophet said (to Sad)."" These (i.e. Banu Quraiza) have agreed to accept your verdict."" Sad said, ""Kill their (men) warriors and take their offspring as captives, ""On that the Prophet said, ""You have judged according to Allah's Judgment,"" or said, ""according to the King's judgment.""    Narrated Atiyyah al-Qurazi: I was among the captives of Banu Qurayza. They (the Companions) examined us, and those who had begun to grow hair (pubes) were killed, and those who had not were not killed. I was among those who had not grown hair.Sunan Abu Dawood, 38:4390   And marriage to Safiyah after killing her husband, her father and many other members of her tribe. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safiyya_bint_Huyayy"

Muhammad tortured her husband for the location of some treasure and had him killed. He also killed her father as you said.  He then took her as a captive and married her. Sure she agreed to marry him. This man just butchered her entire tribe and wasn't playing games. The alternative was to be his sex slave or die.  The other thing in here that was really disturbing to find out was that Muhammad did not observe the Iddat period. According to his own rules in the Quran, he was supposed to wait 4 months after she had been widowed before marrying her. Instead he marries her right after the conquest.   A man who cannot even follow his own teachings has no right to be called a moral exemplar."

So, I was trying to cram new Suras to recite during prayer and I fell upon Surah Masadd (Chapter 111). It was small and first four verses rhymed very well. So I crammed it and started reciting it during various prayers. Later, I became curious about the meaning of said Sura to better understand what has God written in it. I read it.  The power of Abu Lahab will perish, and he will perish.His wealth and gains will not exempt him. He will be plunged in flaming Fire, And his wife, the wood-carrier, Will have upon her neck a halter of palm-fibre (111:1-5)  And I was like, WHAT?! It does not sound anything like mercy. God is singling out one guy out of all Creation and Mo is OK with it. Why couldn't Mo just ask God to please remove this particular sura from Quran. After all, Mo was the reason, this whole universe was created. He went up to heavens to meet the God, goddammit.

This pure unbridled hate speech from someone who is supposed to be the bigger man. Whenever I hear people reciting this in Salaah I wonder if they know they're reading Mo's eternal ""f'k you"" to Abu Lahab.

exmuslim,3d3frv,ReinierPersoon,3,Mon Jul 13 14:08:41 2015 UTC,"A 6th finger isn't a bad mutation. Things like that just run in families, it doesn't have that much to do with inbreeding. All it really does is make it more difficult to buy shoes (because they usually also have 6 toes).  Cats have this too, some cats have more toes than others. It's perfectly normal."
exmuslim,3d3frv,BekasRusa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:13:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not life threatening, but that said, all 3 of them (from the same cousin-parents) had the same physical ""deformities"", so it may be an example of how inbreeding can affect certain things. People with 6 fingers are much less than left-handed people."
exmuslim,3d3frv,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:20:50 2015 UTC,"It is normal for traits like that to run in families. To say it is inbreeding you need to know exactly what genes influence it. If it is a single gene that is dominant you wouldn't need inbreeding at all.  Blue eyed people are also ""inbred"". There was a single mutation some thousands of years ago in someone in the Baltic and it is from recessive genes so some of his offspring mated to create blue-eyed people. Yet no one calls blue eyes a deformity.  Different number of digits is just something that is fairly common. Cats and dogs have it, these are not deformities but different ways of how our genes influence our looks. If having 6 fingers was somehow much more beneficial than having 5, perhaps humans would have evolved to have 6.  I'm left-handed but inbreeding in my family is something of the distant past, when cousin marriages were fairly common. There are a bunch of marriages in the family tree between the same few families because people in the past married people of similar social status."
exmuslim,3d3frv,BekasRusa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:47:27 2015 UTC,"You make sense. Perhaps you know more on this.  Do note that I put the word 'deformities' in double quotes though. I don't mean to imply it is some sort of defect, I just lack the better term for noticeable physical difference than ""normal"" people."
exmuslim,3d3frv,CadmeusCain,4,Tue Jul 14 22:52:36 2015 UTC,"I'm only providing my own observations. I know first cousins married with 3 kids and their kids are normal, ordinary people with above average intellects. Nothing bad happened there. I know many more 2nd and 3rd cousin marriages and still haven't seen anything.  I'm not saying it doesn't happen though. Cousin marriages DO have a higher risk of down syndrome as far as I know."
exmuslim,3d3frv,JLord,2,Mon Jul 13 14:13:47 2015 UTC,"First cousin marriages increase the risk of genetic problems by 1-2%.  About the same increase that is caused by having a women having a child at age 40 as opposed to age 30.  But this rate goes up if you are double first cousins or if there is a family history of cousin marriages,"
exmuslim,3d3frv,hpboy,2,Mon Jul 13 17:56:59 2015 UTC,I know a family that is a second generation product of inbreeding (The parents were cousins and they married. Their kids were cousins and they married) They have a daughter that has type 1 diabetes which she was born with. It's an auto imune disorder and I'm sure the chances of it happening increased due 4x same gene pool.
exmuslim,3d3frv,CadmeusCain,3,Mon Jul 13 19:23:53 2015 UTC,Yeah so this I am familiar with. Apparently successive cousin marriage racks up the rate of birth defects. Not enough variation in the gene pool as far as I understand.
exmuslim,3d3frv,hpboy,2,Mon Jul 13 19:42:11 2015 UTC,I have this condition and it's hard to control. It's sad that people can prevent things like these but choose to stay ignorant and do it because 'Islam allows it'  sometimes I wonder how fucked I would be if I was born to cousins.
exmuslim,3d3frv,BekasRusa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:53:57 2015 UTC,"Of course, I don't deny your observations. Both our observations are anecdotal. I should state that I also have another set of cousins who are the product of a different first cousin marriage, and they turned out fine. The one I mentioned earlier is a more glaring example of why first cousin marriages should be avoided where possible for now, at least until science figures a way to solve this problem."
exmuslim,3d3frv,teachingprogram,3,Mon Jul 13 14:29:58 2015 UTC,"No it's not just a western taboo. Take Indian and Pakistani Punjabis for example. They share the same culture, even the same surnames, same family histories. However, cousin marriage is a very big taboo in the Indian side. On the other hand, it's accepted in Pakistan, in the same culture. The difference is in religion and Arab influence."
exmuslim,3d3frv,CadmeusCain,2,Mon Jul 13 18:13:32 2015 UTC,Hmm... guess I was wrong. Thanks for enlightening me.
exmuslim,3d3frv,teachingprogram,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:35:28 2015 UTC,"Hey! You're not wrong! Inter-cousin marriage has been common. Some western communities still practice it. However, I think in the Pakistani context, when children of inter-cousin marriages continue to marry their cousins and the cycle goes on, it can be detrimental and cause serious problems. At some point, the genes have to diversify."
exmuslim,3d3frv,JimmyBaloo,9,Mon Jul 13 21:44:43 2015 UTC,"She will be deported and will be seen as damaged goods in Pakistan. Not good. Offer to marry her or something wouldn't that actually solve the issue? You may jump on me saying that's a absurd option but Islam allows for absurd reasoning. I just hope a kid doesn't come a long. I think your brother was maybe being a bit cowardly or is simply bitter. From reading your comments it seems like he doesn't want to take responsibility for her. and normally I would agree but the poor thing has always had men to take responsibility for her. Either way his situation could not have been easy so I really don't feel like I can judge him. What a sad, sad situation."
exmuslim,3d3frv,JimmyBaloo,7,Mon Jul 13 08:59:39 2015 UTC,"Indded the situation is rather depressing. I kinda wish he never told me. I kinda wish we hadnt even come out to each other. Ive had this nasty taste in mouth and I feel like shit knowing that in a few months time, shit will really hit the fan. This situation has made me realize that ignorance truly is bliss."
exmuslim,3d3frv,CadmeusCain,8,Mon Jul 13 09:29:39 2015 UTC,Living is easy with closed eyes.
exmuslim,3d3frv,CadmeusCain,5,Mon Jul 13 09:33:33 2015 UTC,"Trust me, you really are better off than before. This was already happening regardless of whether or not you knew about it. Being ignorant would have only made it a much greater shock. This way you can at least prepare for the coming storm. Don't denigrate that; it's worth a lot if you're willing to use it."
exmuslim,3d3frv,CadmeusCain,10,Mon Jul 13 10:12:54 2015 UTC,"Firstly: very glad you and your brother have each other and aren't alone!  Secondly: ouch, this is awful for his wife.  So here's the thing. A gay man married to a straight woman is a way to make them both unhappy. That is the situation they're in and the best thing for both of them may be to get out of it.  That being said, it is horribly unfair on his wife and it was very selfish of him to accept it. The mistake is not getting divorced, as you said it was marrying her in the first place. It is a serious problem for her, her life is really going to suffer for this. It will be difficult for her to remarry because Muslims generally prefer virgins. And she tossed away her whole life in Pakistan to end up in a mess like this.  I think you should speak to your brother. If you're close enough you should let him know you're disappointed in him for marrying her, and that you feel he hasn't considered her feelings. She at least deserves a heads up or to know that he's gay. Christ. Divorce her now rather than string her along until graduation.   EDIT: marriages failing after 2 months aren't the end of the world. It's really better it happens earlier and not later."
exmuslim,3d3frv,CadmeusCain,7,Mon Jul 13 06:43:34 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Good points. Thing is, he wants to end the marriage after graduation so he can do so in a position of safety and power away from our parents. If he were to divorce her now, im not entirely sure how that would go down with my parents.  yup its a really shitty situation"
exmuslim,3d3frv,ifap2impress,7,Mon Jul 13 09:24:16 2015 UTC,"If he were to divorce her now, im not entirely sure how that would go down with my parents. yup its a really shitty situation   Yeah so that's being cowardly. He'd rather her suffer, than he suffer. I think you agree that he should show some integrity and own up to his mistake. We all mistakes, and sometimes we f up big time. We can at least try to make amends.  How far is he from graduation?"
exmuslim,3d3frv,JLord,5,Mon Jul 13 09:35:53 2015 UTC,"He has about 8 months before graduation. When I say that Im not sure how a divorce at present would go down, I mean to say that not only will my brother's safety and well-being be compromised, but mine will be as well. He specifically told me not to tell anyone and he has me by the balls. If I say anything, im sure he would go right ahead and tell my entire family of my apostasy. In which case im not so sure about my safety. Im not ready to deal with something like that atm"
exmuslim,3d3frv,ifap2impress,3,Mon Jul 13 09:47:43 2015 UTC,"I mean to say that not only will my brother's safety and well-being be compromised, but mine will be as well.  If I say anything, im sure he would go right ahead and tell my entire family of my apostasy. In which case im not so sure about my safety. Im not ready to deal with something like that atm   Hmm... I see the position that you find yourself in. You want to be benevolent but you also don't want to be stupid. I wasn't advocating that you make this public or even tell her. I think the worst thing to do would be make a scene. And to get involved in someone else's mess is often one of the worst decisions you can make (I learned this lesson the hard way from getting involved in other peoples' messes).  All I was advocating was that, if you're unhappy about it, you speak to your brother and tell him how you feel. I would even say that your responsibility ends there. You risk making things even worse for him, her and yourself by interfering. And if we're talking personal safety, that comes first.  I also think this: at the end of the day he is your brother, and you are going to need him in your life especially if you're going to be an apostate. He may be doing something that disappoints you, but that's life. One day we'll all likely do something that lets down someone we love (we've all already let down our parents by becoming apostates). If you can, do try and maintain a strong relationship with him. Having someone in the situation with you is the best thing either of you could ask for. Down the line, both of you will need each other plenty.  Good luck, and feel free to PM me if you want to talk about this further."
exmuslim,3d3frv,BekasRusa,4,Mon Jul 13 10:09:49 2015 UTC,This guy knows what's up. Thank you /u/CadmeusCain. I was completely losing confidence in this thread.
exmuslim,3d3frv,factually_accurate_1,2,Mon Jul 13 14:12:03 2015 UTC,"Probably the best thing your brother can do is to come out confidentially to his wife and offer her the options of continuing the marriage for immigration purposes or ending it sooner under circumstances of her choosing.  I don't blame him for marrying her because who knows what his mindset was at the time, but now that he realizes his mistake he should try to minimize the damage caused to the other person."
exmuslim,3d3frv,nikolajlr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:54:53 2015 UTC,THEN DON'T. Let your brother deal with it dude!
exmuslim,3d3frv,ReinierPersoon,3,Mon Jul 13 14:10:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with the general notion that his brother is selfish, but to call him coward is unfair imo. A majority of us here are also ""cowards"", lying and betraying our way to our ultimate goal of freedom from Islam behind the backs of our loved ones. No one really knows the extent of how much he was railroaded into the marriage. Anonymity is an ex-Muslim's best weapon, and to reject the proposal of an arranged marriage is to risk giving away his greatest weapon of survival. Cruel, yes, but life is hardly fair, there are some necessary evil, sometimes the ends justify the means, and so on. I actually agree that it's better that the OP knew beforehand about the imminent shit storm, so that, even if his brother only has apathy left in him, he can still do something about it.  Again, I wouldn't judge the brother so harshly for what he had to do. Many of us here are never tested in life the way he did. People are not perfect."
exmuslim,3d3frv,BlckHawks2015,8,Mon Jul 13 14:24:53 2015 UTC,"If your sister-in-law got her green card through marriage then she will most likely be deported if it has been less than two years since she is married. Even if it has been more than two years, she might still get deported if your brother hasn't filed for Removal of Conditions with the CIS.   However, your sister-in-law can stay in the US if she is divorced and she can prove that the grounds for divorce was valid and she did not just marry your brother to move to the USA, get a green card and then divorce him.  Being gay is a perfectly valid grounds to prove just that. If you can do nothing else, then please at least help your sister-in-law to stay in the US and not get deported by making her aware of all these procedures once everything is out in the open.   EDIT: I'm sure your brother already realizes this but for the love of humanity please don't let him have any kids with this woman."
exmuslim,3d3frv,malis-,7,Mon Jul 13 15:40:50 2015 UTC,Oh shit! Poor girl! :(
exmuslim,3d3frv,razibenghazi,5,Mon Jul 13 06:14:46 2015 UTC,Exactly my response. It is becoming increasingly difficult to live in this house when you know of the imminent explosion that is to come. She doesnt deserve this. Nor should my brother have to go through his life closeted.
exmuslim,3d3frv,fuckparalysis,2,Mon Jul 13 09:16:49 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you could discuss with your brother the idea of staying married until the girl has residency or citizenship? I have no idea how long that would take, but I assume after a few years she would be entitled to stay after a divorce.  They probably don't even need to live in the same house, just stay married on paper. If he is away from your parents and has his own job they can more or less go their own way while still being married.  I wouldn't push it with your brother though, ultimately it is his decision and you can't force him to do anything. And you will want your brother as a friend too, since you will likely lose friends/family if you ever come out."
exmuslim,3d3frv,BlckHawks2015,5,Mon Jul 13 20:22:29 2015 UTC,To be fair divorce is not the end of World for her much more common these days. Lots more open minded people now.
exmuslim,3d3frv,Atheizm,5,Mon Jul 13 08:38:36 2015 UTC,"Which is why I immediately dismiss any marriage prospects my family and relatives have thrown at me.   It is just wrong. You'd be doing a disservice to the girl and to yourself, all because of family peer pressure."
exmuslim,3d3frv,PeaceAndDressings,5,Mon Jul 13 09:29:26 2015 UTC,"SHIT HAPPENS! You brother may seem selfish or foolish to have gone through the marriage but for him the stakes would have been too high. Being an apostate and being gay. One does not simply come clean to desi parents. This is extremely sad for his wife too. She could be the queen of someone's life but instead now, if she gets divorced, she will probably be exploited by her future husband for losing her virginity (second hand material) and that too to a gay person.   You should take Twiceadopted's advice on waiting till she becomes a citizen. Secondly you and your brother should sort out a plan for all of this. How you are going to break it to her and what happens to her next. Is she a small town girl? Does she think that being a homosexual is a choice or a natural inclination? Introduce her to some material, books and maybe movies, on this subject so that she may be able to empathize with your brother's situation when the news is broken to her.   Remember it is extremely important for her to realize that it is not her fault. IT IS NOT HER FAULT. If she walks away from this relationship thinking anything otherwise then her coming life would be just bitter and that sourness will spread to those around her. You need a plan for both your brother and her wife. Don't break it straight up. Stay strong. And remember NO BABIES!"
exmuslim,3d3frv,vestayekta,6,Mon Jul 13 12:06:33 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I laughed so hard at the title because of the subreddit. Goddammit. How did we get here?"
exmuslim,3d3frv,vestayekta,3,Mon Jul 13 18:29:07 2015 UTC,I just think Muslim young people who've been raised in the West need to stand up to their parents and say enough is enough with these horrible arranged marriages from the cousin back home.  Even from an Islamic perspective they can't force you to marry anyone. This is just pure Jahiliya. You are destroying not only your own life but that of someone else.
exmuslim,3d3frv,PeaceAndDressings,3,Mon Jul 13 21:36:47 2015 UTC,"In one way I understand why your brother got married -- it was family pressure -- and his coldness to his wife, unfortunately, is how he's projecting.   Maybe your brother is a dick or maybe he isn't but perhaps she'll prefer marrying another man who'll love her and isn't related."
exmuslim,3d3frv,robotroller,4,Mon Jul 13 21:45:09 2015 UTC,"Aw... What a tough situation all around. Though what your brother is doing is difficult to accept, it is the right thing for him, and it is better for him to make things right sooner than later. He could have avoided getting your cousin tangled up in his mess, but hopefully your family will remain as a support system for her after their divorce. Does he plan to divorce her outright or will he explain his loss of faith and sexual incompatibility to her? It would be a shame to have her walk away from this marriage without closure."
exmuslim,3d3frv,ZeeyardSA,5,Mon Jul 13 05:37:57 2015 UTC,"Im not sure if he plans to just divorce her out right but the way he told me and the way he so nonchalantly explained to me, it seems to me that he doesnt really give a shit about her.  This is what he said after I asked him about what will happen to his wife ""fuck her. Ive given her freedom. What more does she want?"""
exmuslim,3d3frv,Faith-Breaker,6,Mon Jul 13 05:50:06 2015 UTC,This is what happens when someone puts away his own well-being and wishes for so long. He's probably struggled with his sexuality for years not wanting to upset anyone in the family and now he simply can no longer afford to think about another person.
exmuslim,3d3frv,jstlsr,5,Mon Jul 13 08:16:57 2015 UTC,"Part of me really hates my parents for this situation. I know my bro didnt initially want to get married and now I know why. Parents kept pressuring him and saying how its good to get married early yadah yadah.  If only we lived in a progressive, secular family I am sure a lot these issues woudnt even come up.  Whelp, one can only dream of such a world."
exmuslim,3d3frv,Twiceadopted,4,Mon Jul 13 09:15:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, your parents are partly responsible for this situation.   If your SIL is a stay at home wife, ask your brother to encourage her to go to university and find a job."
exmuslim,3d3frv,hpboy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:23:51 2015 UTC,"What more does she want?   Aaaghhh. I hope he can humble himself and empathize with her situation. He gave her ""freedom,"" she gave him her virginity and her honor which will be ""stained"" by divorce, her trust in allowing him to remove her from her family and country, her devotion as she probably stays at home and makes life comfortable for him in more ways than one... Your brother can do the responsible adult thing and break the news softly to her. My heart goes out to her."
exmuslim,3d3frv,Twiceadopted,2,Mon Jul 13 06:03:35 2015 UTC,"Yikes. Well, the damage is already done. Nothing you can do about it. Shame for the girl, though. I imagine that her reputation will be forever sullied."

Your bros Gay and as such i guess he done what he felt he needed to do to get the family of his back. Its a bitch move but whats done is done. Best that you can do is look at making her transition back to being single as easy as possible.   Good luck man
exmuslim,3d3frv,Twiceadopted,2,Mon Jul 13 11:11:29 2015 UTC,"What pisses me off is he knew he was gay through the marriage and he willfully agreed. And the way he tells me, it looks like he has absolutely no remorse or doesnt understand the gravity of what he's about to do.   She married the wrong brother."
exmuslim,3d3frv,PeaceAndDressings,2,Mon Jul 13 12:57:32 2015 UTC,"I know this is not the case here but, this is the reason why people should stop trying to ""cure"" homosexuality by marrying their children!   Anyway, it's a great thing that you can finally be open with your brother despite the huge load he dropped on your shoulders. I would advise you to just stay out of it."
exmuslim,3d3frv,BlckHawks2015,3,Tue Jul 14 06:55:05 2015 UTC,"So My adoptive fam is also Pakistani. They are the kindest bunch. Because I don't live with them anymore, I have my own wife and her kids and our kid, alhamdulilah second one on the way. What I do remember growing up that, sending a girl back home is the worst thing for her. The culture is pretty terrible when it comes to divorcees.   I would recommend, that the matter be brought up to your parents and her asap. After the initial shock and anger, the matter needs to be discussed in a proper way. Involve her parents aswell. Put options in front of them. One of them being. The daughter stays married until paperwork arrives. Once she is a citizen, your brother and her can go through a divorce. Your bro is going to move out so that's good. She can stay here and get re-married, even after citizenship if she goes back. Her parents wouldn't just marry her off with any old dude looking to get married. Being a citizen has chances of attracting educated folks too, who are interested in getting out. But vetting will be difficult, since you can't tell, if a dude is marrying her because he wants to or for a chance to get to the US.   The situation sucks but it can be salvaged by getting your sis in law citizenship. Her staying here and enrolling in school and working may be the best thing for her self confidence. Once she's used to living here and life start to roll, she will be more then capable of find a well balanced spouse.   Believe it or not, masjids are filled with good Muslims looking to get married to good Muslimahs regardless of previous life choices.   My wife is also Pakistani Muslim. This is exactly what happened to her, except the dude was a rotten drunkard and strung her along for a few years putting 2 kids in her lap.  His family thought he'd come back to the better way and responsibility after getting married. Weirdest things the Pakistanis do."
exmuslim,3d3frv,Twiceadopted,11,Mon Jul 13 08:35:05 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the advice but I dont think I could approach my parents or her about this at present. My bro has me by the balls ( I told him of my apostasy) and he told me not to tell anyone of what we spoke about. Not only do I want to honor this promise, but I will be fucked if I break it and he finds out. I dont think he would take it very kindly. I CANNOT let my parents know that I am no longer muslim. I fear for my well-being if they find out. And I am not ready to deal with the fallout of that situation at the moment. Perhaps once I am in a position of power and am safe, I can consider doing something like that but I fear by the time that happens it will already be too late"
exmuslim,3d3frv,BlckHawks2015,2,Mon Jul 13 09:38:03 2015 UTC,The wife needs to know no matter what. She is being played like a puppet. This shit needs to stop.  Your brother is a little bitch for doing something that could ruin that girls life for ever. All he had to do was grow some balls 2 months ago and not get married. What is a man if he can't even say no to his parents?
exmuslim,3d3frv,Twiceadopted,0,Mon Jul 13 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"Sure, you guys don't need to bring up his sexual orientation or you guys's apostasy. When ever this matter does become public, you don't have to cross your brother but you do need to talk to him about bringing it up to your parents and her before making divorce happen for her sake."
exmuslim,3d3frv,ifap2impress,9,Mon Jul 13 15:39:40 2015 UTC,"No. No no no no no no. No.  Listening to the above poster will completely sever your newfound connection with your brother and will undermine his trust with you. Your brother is as much of a victim of the toxic culture as your cousin/sister in law.   I would speak to your brother about this personally and confidentially. I'm sure he would be willing to find the least destructive resolution to this precarious situation.   DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS TOP POST AND BRING IT UP TO YOUR PARENTS.. It WILL become a shit show for your entire family. Your brother tells you in confidence that he's gay, which is definitely his most guarded secret due to fear of being MURDERED or ostracized and you simply cannot put him in that danger.  I'm very disappointed in /r/exmuslim for making this the top post. Downvote me to hell but whoever made this to the top should be ashamed for either not reading it all or even worse agreeing with the asinine advice given."
exmuslim,3d3frv,PeaceAndDressings,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:07:34 2015 UTC,"My friend,  I'm not asking OP to cross his bro, bring up his sexual orientation or their apostasy. The goal is to not have him divorce her before her citizenship is finalized.   If he talks to his brother and they agree to tell that parents and the wife about the divorce leaving out his sexual orientation and apostasy as early as possible, this is for the best. At least the wife won't be dressing up for him, expecting him to become intimate with her. If he doesn't she probably is thinking she isn't attractive like the American women he might be used to. Oh, God what if he is already being intimate with her just to keep appearances, how bad would it be for him and her."
exmuslim,3d3frv,ifap2impress,2,Mon Jul 13 15:49:39 2015 UTC,"For real. The aim should be to bring up the intention of divorce, at the very least. Allow the girl to prepare her options and make the best of a tough situation."
exmuslim,3d3frv,TheMuslimAtheist2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:18:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if that's good advise. Citizenship can take a few years and it's kind of illegal to get it based on marriage if you are staying married just for citizenship. I dunno, probably not a big deal, but I'm sure they will be interviewed etc..why keep both of them on the hook for that long?  Might as well let her know the truth asap and let her get on with her life. She may wish to return home to be with family, she did NOTHING wrong and has not reason to be ashamed."
exmuslim,3d3frv,KhalAhmed,3,Mon Jul 13 21:26:36 2015 UTC,"Unless his brother is graduating and moving out within 7-9 months. Citizenship usually comes pretty quickly. Less then a year in majority of cases.   I agree there isn't anything wrong with in and there shouldn't be shame attached with it. But we're talking about an idealist situation VS how Majority of Pakistanis will behave.   It's a high probability that she may not find a good prospective spouse in Pakistan, because Pakistanis sadly will take divorce into consideration.

Later I was told that if you are rejecting hadith you are also rejecting Koran as sayings from the same people helped put together the koran.  It was all very confusing.

I studied Islam  thoroughly, and any time I had trouble and finding weird stuff I would ask that teacher in particular, and she'd come up with a lie like ""Oh, this hadith is dhaéef."" or ""Oh, this doesn't mean beating up woman like THAT. It means..."" I brought myself to doing it. And then, once I was done studying the life of the Prophet, I studied the lives of the Sahabah. It disturbed me to so many extents. There was a time when Muhammad was in war and he killed a kaafir, and he and his friends were laughing at him because his private part was showing. Narrations say he was laughing so much his molar teeth were showing. Excuse me? And that's when I doubted Islam, and now I don't want to wear hijaab. I live in Saudi Arabia, so it's impossible to not wear hijaab, but now, I'm not scared if anybody sees my 'awrah' hair. I have the freedom to listen to music. I don't feel guilty missing prayers. Infact, I have remains of the brainwashing. But, why would such a 'merciful' God throw anybody in Hell who doesn't believe in a sick man like Muhammad? Soo merciful. I knew this whole 'hidden pearl' thing was ridiculous. These memes comparing a girl with hijaab and a girl without hijab like ""Nonhijabi > Flaming HOT.. in hellfire"" ""Hijabi : light.. in heaven"" ""Nonhijabi > dirty lollipop without wrapping"" that one was really lame haha ""Hijabi > clean lollipop with wrapping"" and Muslim men calling non-hijabis sluts when they masturbate to porn every night. It's sad. An old religion from 1.400 years ago, still being followed today. Ridiculous. I believe God exists, but why on Earth would God be so freaking cruel?"

He then proceeded to yell that I'm a tarnished jewel (lololololol) and need to 'make the most of this ramadan' by repenting for my sins. fyi this was cause i rocked up home drunk off my face and it got back to my fambam that id spent the better part of that night hooking up with someone :-) like oh noes ive tarnished my reputation now no shitty, deluded, brainless, judgemental loser boys will want to marry me :(((((((( how ever will i get past this."

As we all know, he was praised and everything about his life was romanticized plus I was brainwashed and naive. Needless to say, I was in love with him, and he was my hero. I started reading about the companions lives. I loved every story. How faithful they were, how brave they were, how pious they were, how generous they were ect... Again I wished nothing more than to be like them.   After that, I wanted to read about the ""female"" companions. I searched for a book. It took me awhile to find one. once I started reading this was the beginning of every story:   ""She was the mother of so-and-so"" , ""she was the wife of so-and-so"" ,""she was the daughter of so-andso"" or""she was the sister of so-and-so. I was really disappointed. I hated the fact that these women had no values without the men in their lives. It sounded ridiculous in my mind. I expected it to be inspirational, but it was nothing but a disappointment.    And now , this. Funny, they think its a way to make women feel special. Screw that. I can be ""SOMEONE"" without being a mother, a daughter, a sister or a wife."

I'm sure there are many who doubt or have questions but are forced to suppress them in order keep fitting in.  Recently I found out that some people I knew for years were closet ex Mooses. For two years we'd been struggling with Islam independently yet struggled on our own because we didn't think we could talk to anyone. It makes me wonder who else out there is keeping up appearances.

I have nothing against the organization but their not a people I have any faith in. But such energy and passion that could have been harnessed had only someone came a long to lead them. Say what you like about the EDL they may be thugs, scum whatever you want to call them but they have never gang raped Pakistani children, They have never beheaded a man in the street, they don't bash gays and I've found that as long as you don't approach them when they're all hyped up they are  very receptive to good conversation.   That being said London is still a lot of fun and I met up with a girl from craigslist who was Pakistani who I'm sure usually wore the scarf. She wouldn't go to the bar in our hotel because it was a Indonesian hotel and she was afraid someone would see her as it served Halal food. So we met in the pub a few blocks down.  I don't have a source for this statistic as it was only on a news show had I seen it on net I'd have made a note. But it said something like 80% of Pakistani Londoner women have a job where as only 53% of Pakistani men have a job.  Do you really think career women will tolerate being put down by their lesser men? Women either integrate extremely well or don't integrate at all. Pakistani men seem to have their feet in both worlds but their ego is attached to being Pakistani and therefore Muslim."

exmuslim,3d2xxv,talltaleteller,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:12:53 2015 UTC,predominantly Sunni Muslim they all act and dress like Russians. Even Niqab wearing Muzzie women have all the mannerisms of a typical brit.  According to Wiki 53% are Kazack (majority sunni) 33% are Russian.  Russians dominate the culture. The cultural history is however very different due to communism. Communism enforced atheism where as the west only enforces freedom of expression. So in that sense its a bad comparison. I didn't really put all that much thought into the comparison honestly  and forgot I even said it but i've explained my simple reasoning.   Another thing i'll add is that when cultures clash they always take something away from the other culture. This has been seen time and time again in the past. However western culture for whatever reason doesn't seem to. many western nations are pussywipped by political correctness but I don't think Muslims have made any impact on our culture as a whole as they simply don't integrate. If they did then they would.

exmuslim,3d1as4,Dayandnight95,18,Sun Jul 12 22:27:46 2015 UTC,"Muslim here, Kaaba has a long history of building and rebuilding. Kaaba was heavily damaged once during the life of Prophet Muhammad(pbuh). It was re-built. Then it was damaged during a war amongst the Muslims and was rebuilt. The current outline of the Kaaba is that which was shortened by the pagans of Mecca. The boundaries of Kaaba that were set up by Prophet Ibrahim(as) are much larger and if you ever saw pictures, there are 2 markers on either side of the Kaaba indicating its real shape to a rectangle Instead of a cube."

Last time this happened was sometime in the 1940s.  Given that the Kaaba is the holiest of the holies and that the area of the Harem is revered as being the house of Allah, how do you continue to believe in a God that can't even protect his own house?   I'm assuming you've read about the 1979 siege of Mecca? Where was Allah to defend his home and his pilgrims? It was embarrassing to have to bring in kaffir help to liberate the Mosque.   I don't mean to put you on the spot, but I'm curious as to what your justification is for continuing to believe in this God."
exmuslim,3d1as4,MooHamMadsBuraq,3,Mon Jul 13 01:34:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think denying Kaaba had to be reconstructed over the ages is a Muslim thing. Maybe we'll have our share of deniers I suppose, but a very well known story about Kaaba's reconstruction is taught to kids. Prior to the nabuwah, where Kaaba was damaged by the annual floods, and after construction Aswad was to be placed back and disagreements arose from amongst the different tribes of Quraish, finally the Prophet won the honor of placing the Aswad back in place, which he did by the help of the chieftains carrying the Aswad.   I must admit I'm not acquainted with the theology as well, since my conversion to Islam around a year or so ago.   What little I do know, it goes like this, the building of Kaaba itself isn't anything special it's the land of Haram that's been granted immunity and peace. Haram meaning forbidden and all falsehood, fighting, cheating is prohibited.   Allah(swt) intervened only when Abraha wanted to wipe the Kaaba off completely. The accounts are mentioned in Surah feel.   The building itself taking damage due to political squabbles that weren't geared towards obliterating the legacy of a Prophet Ibrahim(as) are disliked but since they aren't a threat to the legacy of Ibrahim and the purpose of Kaaba, no intervention is required. I could be wrong though.   Islam and Muslims have a few different names in Qur'an I.E deen-ul-haq and Milat-ul-Ibrahim. Prophet Ibrahim(as) plays an important role in the theology. I can think of at 4 out of the 5 pillars as being directly related to a Prophet Ibrahim(as).   Prior to Prophet Ibrahim(as), there wasn't any salah given and there was no temple for the followers of deen-Ul-haq. Kaaba is seen as the 1st mosque.   If we take your question at face value then surely one can expand the logic to ask, why wasn't the house of Allah(swt) protected by idols, why do Muslims clean the Kaaba, shouldn't Allah(swt) be able to maintain his own house.  The care of Kaaba has been given to humans it's a land made sacred and a land on which all evils are made haram leaving special circumstances out."

The wind being violent, a spark flew and attached itself to the curtains of the Kaʿbah and burnt them. As a result, the walls were cracked, and turned black. This took place in the year 64 [c. 686 C.E]. After the death of Yazīd ibn Muʿāwiyah and the departure of al-Ḥuṣain ibn Numair to Syria, Ibn az-Zubair ordered that the stones that had been thrown into it be removed, and they were removed. He then demolished the Kaʿbah, and rebuilt it on its old foundation, using stones in the building. He opened two doors on the ground, one to the east, and the other to the west; one for entrance and the other for exit. In building it he found that the foundation was laid on al-Ḥijr. His object was to give it the shape it had in the days of Abraham, as it had been described to him by ʿĀʾis̠ah, the mother of the believers, on the authority of the Prophet. The doors of the Kaʿbah, Ibn az-Zubair plated with gold, and its keys he made of gold. When al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf fought on behalf of ʿAbd al-Malik ibn Marwān and killed Ibn az-Zubair, ʿAbd al-Malik wrote to al-Ḥajjāj ordering him to rebuild the Kaʿbah and the Ḥaram-mosque, the stones hurled at it having made cracks in the walls. Accordingly, al-Ḥajjāj pulled the Kaʿbah down and rebuilt it according to the shape given it by Qurais̠, removing all stones thereof.”[188]"

It's also expected that I will cry in the dua, as everyone gets super emotional.   It just feels like complete bullshit, because everyone is telling me all of the duas they want me to make, for the Ummah, for their families, for their loved ones who are sick...even my parents asked me to forgive them and pray for their forgiveness.

I feel so dishonest too - usually, I think it's fucking hilarious that I get to lead their prayers and stuff, but today I feel dishonest.

exmuslim,3d4ptt,CadmeusCain,3,Tue Jul 14 19:43:25 2015 UTC,"The truth is that Muhammad WASN'T actually illiterate. Here are three Hadiths from Bukhari that involve Muhammad writing something. The last is quite direct. Also: Muhammad was a highly successful merchant. It's hard to imagine he could have been one if he couldn't do basic reading/writing.  Sahih Bukhari 1:3:65   Narrated Anas bin Malik:  Once the Prophet wrote a letter or had an idea of writing a letter. The Prophet was told that they (rulers) would not read letters unless they were sealed. So the Prophet got a silver ring made with ""Muhammad Allah's Apostle"" engraved on it. As if I were just observing its white glitter in the hand of the Prophet...   Sahih Bukhari 7:62:88   Narrated 'Ursa:  The Prophet wrote the (marriage contract) with 'Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death).   Sahih Bukhari 1:3:114   Narrated 'Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah:  Ibn 'Abbas said, ""When the ailment of the Prophet became worse, he said, 'Bring for me (writing) paper and I will write for you a statement after which you will not go astray.' But 'Umar said, 'The Prophet is seriously ill, and we have got Allah's Book with us and that is sufficient for us.' But the companions of the Prophet differed about this and there was a hue and cry. On that the Prophet said to them, 'Go away (and leave me alone). It is not right that you should quarrel in front of me."" Ibn 'Abbas came out saying, """"It was most unfortunate (a great disaster) that Allah's Apostle was prevented from writing that statement for them because of their disagreement and noise."

My grandma was illiterate, but she surely was able to read her medicines labels and do math when dealing with cash.  People back then had stronger memory, and they could easily recall stories and poems. Also, poetry was huge in the Arabian peninsula.   Muhammad didn't bring the Quran all at once. The Quran wasn't even written in a book until after Muhammad's death. Not to mention that writing and paper was expensive back then."
exmuslim,3d4ptt,ImaginaryFoe,3,Mon Jul 13 16:58:36 2015 UTC,Plagiarism.
exmuslim,3d4ptt,CadmeusCain,2,Mon Jul 13 15:15:43 2015 UTC,"but the way vocabulary and the use of different literary techniques was pretty good.   How familiar are you with ancient literature? Try reading the Iliad and the Odyssey. They're about 3000 year old and far surpass the Quran in terms of narrative and poetic technique. the two books are considered the cornerstone of Western Literature.  Many cultures have incredible ancient poetry. The Quran is certainly the classic of the Arabic language, but it comes from a region with a long history of poetry. Reading the Islamic histories should tell you that there were many excellent poets long before Muhammad and long after him as well. In other cultures and languages, there are poets just as good and no one considers them divine.  Then there is the Old Testament itself which is one of the most influential books in Western literature as well. In terms of narrative, it far surpasses the Quran. The New Testament may surpass even the Old Testament and predates the Quran by 600 years.   It also had scientific theories that are somewhat similar to the ones discovered long after the Quran was made   Yeah so this is BS. The Quran has tons of scientific inaccuracies and is actually behind it's time in terms of scientific understanding. For instance, the ancient Egyptians knew more about embryology than the Quran.  http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Scientific_Errors_in_the_Quran  http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Embryology_in_the_Quran  https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/history-embryology-1959-joseph-needham   How was Muhammad to ""make up"" all the things in the Quran and write it in a advanced way (for its time)?   Muhammad was an excellent poet. However, much of what he wrote is straight plagiarism. He picked up stories and myths that were well known at the time and incorporated them into his tradition, making numerous historical and scientific errors along the way.   It seems like it was way ahead of its time   For Arabia it certainly was. For the rest of the world, not so much."

Atheists are usually born into a religion and if you ask me where they learned violence, I will assume that they inherited it from their religions. Most religions harbor violence and aggression. Did God want religions to look like this? Probably no. Currently what people are believing as religion are men made rules.

The interesting thing is that Muslims will always look for a scholar to explain these errors/crazy shit but don't realize that if the Quran was really the perfect book, written by God, there wouldn't be anything that even seemed remotely wrong or crazy in it. There couldn't be a math error in it's inheritance, and yes, I know that the scholars have modified the rules after the fact to make the inheritance work, but that doesn't change the fact that the Quran itself was wrong."

La illaha Illa Allah and you shall not do anything that goes against this ideology. If anything islam is as counter cultural as you can get. Why do you think Muslims dress in black and white? They hate anything artistic and anything that is cultural.   So no this isn't culture this is religion.

What is Islamic art? What is so Islamic about symmetrical geometric mosaics?, Well it's Islamic because Islam forbade drawings of faces and human bodies. This constraint led to the development of what is now known as Islamic art. The same is the case for honour killing. You attach so much honour and shame with the women of the society that a women who does not conform to such norms is assumed to be a whore. Just go to Muslim-majority countries. Men hit on women who are not in full jilbab and burka. In KSA you will find hungry eyes of men scanning the malls for women, just so they can get a glimpse of anything.

The religious language surrounding security issues is just for ""public consumption"". In other words, while Iran may use religion to dress up its security policies in ways that appeal to the masses, its core decisions are hard, cold, calculating and very rational.  Most people get caught up in the superficial rhetoric (especially with regards to Jihad) and unfortunately miss the underlying hegemonic power struggles. Today, Iran goes death to America and Israel and what not and uses colorful religious language, but tomorrow if this nuclear deal goes through and then with time tensions simmer down, and Iran sees geostrategic benefits in cooperation, you could suddenly notice how the tone of the mullahs changes to treating Jews and Israel as Ahle-Kitab and Abrahamic brothers, etc. In short, no, religion does not drive the underlying strategic decisions, but yes religion does clothe the superficial 'brand' of the strategies. Religion, has and continues to be used as a tool for ""optics"" (politicians making themselves look good) and for controlling the masses by exerting a form of authority."

I apologize for the poor quality, it's the only source I found.

About the title: yes I know, it does veer towards the politically correct in the conclusion but I think it stays relatively on point throughout the most of it. It does address many difficult issues and acknowledges to a far greater extent than most mainstream media that terrorism and sexism isn't exclusively cultural.  If anyone here knows more about this, can someone give me a breakdown of the academical opinions on Luxenberg's Syrio-Aramaic interpretation?

You're both legally adults and you're in the U.S., so your situation is not as bad as the ones we usually get from users on this forum.   I know it sounds horrible to tell someone to leave their parents behind, but that is what religion does to families. Religious parents will force their children to live up to their ideals with no regard for what the child wants. You and your sister must live your life however you want and your father does not have the right to stop you. We get about a dozen threads a week from depressed individuals in similar situations who're contemplating suicide. Unlike many of them who're stuck in Muslim countries with no way out, you have the opportunity to fix your problem. You're in a country where there are laws that protect you from abusive parents."

A guy like him needs to get his priority straight and find out what's real in his life, what he's pushing away, and what he thinks is true versus what actually IS.   Pretty soon he'll realize all these ""friends"" are actually fair weather and that with his religion he pushed everybody away. The people who were real to him (hopefully).   As for you and your sister, you guys can't afford to stay there, yup move out and live the life you guys really want. It's a big world out there and not having family around isn't the worst thing in the world either. This is in many ways a perfect age.   Wishing you the best.   Hopefully you can meet up with him a bit later and reflect back to him all the best parts that made you look up to your Dad.

I don't think you understand how much this helped me. I was exactly like you in the aspect of falling in love with Islam. Now that I read what you said and thought about it, it seems like the only reason I still have some small attachment to Islam (even after disagreeing with a ton of it's rules and principals) is probably because I always felt like I had a purpose because of it. So thank you for helping me further open my eyes (looks like I need to find a better purpose).  As for your situation, I think it's better for you to leave your dad and go.    when he's not smacking her for going out with friends at night   Literally smacking? Abuse for disobeying rules is always a sure sign to leave imo. Unlike most people that come on here and share their situation, it looks like you and your sister have the ability to get the hell out of there. I'd say take it. Also keep in touch with your mom.

You shouldn't feel guilty at all for leaving your father- you have to remember that if his 'love' for you and your sister is conditional to you both practising Islam then it isn't love at all, and regardless of this, you do not owe it to anybody to live by restrictions based on a set of beliefs you don't follow.

You're only sixteen and you're still dependent on your parents, rebelling against them is only going to make your life even harder than it is right now. Figure out what you want to do in your life and focus on your education. You can move out when you're legally an adult.   I know there are probably  some lurkers on here from UK, maybe you can reach out to one of them to help you figure out how you can report the abuse you mentioned in the first paragraph. If you're going through physical abuse you should report it right now and the authorities will help you. We have an ex-Muslim on here who got a restraining order against her parents, but she was an adult. Obviously your situation is much more complicated because you're a minor, but you shouldn't be going through any kind of abuse no matter what your age.   Edit: I just realized I didn't directly address what you asked us to do.   TL;DR I have a boyfriend and I need advice on what to do after I get caught and how to deal with it as I will be losing everything if I do get caught.   This may sound harsh, but considering your current situation your priority should be you, not your boyfriend. That's what I think, sorry.

It's the best they're gonna get. And who am I to ruin all that again 😂 I give up on them. It's not about them anymore.  He could be locked up right now if I call the police because the order has not been lifted and there's contact every single day. But I'm gonna leave it. Let them be, it was harder for me without dad anyway because I had to do EVERYTHING he did. Life experience at being a dad. Bills, shopping, kids school, etc and not having much time for my school cause I was running around like a dog.  I have my stuff planned, I'm happy to say that I got into a college, I start September, and hopefully will get a job this summer, I'm really trying. I'm taking it as it comes.

Realizing Islam is syncretic. Studying the seerah and Quran, making it plainly obvious Mo was a huge fraud at the head of one successful cult that hadn't died out yet.   Understanding that Islam was and is a very old colonial project that's had incredibly disastrous effects on countless peoples through history. Whether through the genocide of whole languages and cultures, slavery and erasure of history. I saw it in my own Somali heritage and many others.   The inherent misogyny in Islam.  All the cognitive dissonance that comes from trying to balance all the wtfery of Islam with belief comes to a head and faith falls away.

And I was telling him how he'd have to convert or at least pretend to... and basically he rejected that. So I stepped back for a moment and started to think ""WTF is wrong with me?!"" I only really wanted him to convert for the sake of appeasing my parents. I am fine with him the way he is. And that's when the wheels started turning. Even before him I never really saw myself as being OK with being with a muslim guy. They all seem to be hypocrites .. at least in the west.   But really, I was never super into Islam to begin with. I had fear and I enjoyed being praised for being a ""good"" muslim. But I don't even know too much about it really (compared to other muslims).

exmuslim,3d1jtf,captaindisguise,5,Sun Jul 12 19:36:26 2015 UTC,"I recommend this article by her about the oft-quoted ""There is no compulsion in religion"" verse (2.256):  http://orient.ruf.uni-freiburg.de/dotpub/crone.pdf  Here's the TLDR:  The earliest classical Muslim scholars interpreted this verse in 6 different ways, most of which were not particularly peaceful.   It was abrogated It only applied to a specific historical context and was no longer relevant.  As is mentioned in this hadith (http://www.sunnah.com/abudawud/15/206), the Ansar had a custom of making oaths to raise their children Jewish if they lived.  Verse 2:256 said they were not obligated to keep that promise. Muslims can’t force those they’ve subjugated to become Muslim but they CAN force them to pay Jizyah (http://quran.com/9/29) and other extra taxes (Dhimmis were an important source of income for the Islamic State).  Some Muslim scholars disagreed if Dhimmitude only applied to “people of the Book” or if it also applied to everyone else, including pagans.  Those scholars of the first opinion felt it was OK to fight pagans (and other people who weren't considered ""people of the Book"") until they converted to Islam without giving them the option of Dhimmitude, i.e. ""convert to Islam or die"". Allah does not force people to become Muslims (but humans can) People can not really change the inner beliefs of others, but you can make them practice Islam for their own good and maybe they will see the light one day It was unlawful to force Muslims to renounce Islam."

Do you have proof for your statement that Al-Tabari, Fakhr Al-Din Al-Razi, Al-Qurtubi interpreted it in the same way?  What about this quote from Al-Qurtubi:  Tafsir Al-Qurtubi 2.193, page 496   Fight them until there is no more fitna and the deen belongs to Allah alone.  This command to fight every idolater in every place according to those who say that it abrogates the previous ayats, it means: fight those about whom Allah says, “if they fight you” the former is the more likely meaning.  It is an unqualified command to fight without precondition of hostilities being initiated by the unbelievers. The evidence for that is the words of Allah, and the *din belongs to Allah alone.”  The Prophet said, “I was commanded to fight people until they say, ‘there is no god but Allah.’  The ayat and hadith both indicate that the reason for fighting is disbelief because Allah says, “until there is no more fitna,” meaning disbelief in this case.  So the goal is to abolish disbelief and that is clear.*  Ibn Abbas, Qatada, ar-Rabi, as-Suddi and others said that fitna here means shirk and the subsequent injury to the believers caused by it.  The root of fitna is testing and trial, derived from the term for testing silver when it is put in the fire to separate the impurities from the pure metal.   .  Here's more evidence that Muslim scholars felt it and similar verses were abrogated:   Tafsir Ibn Kathir 009.005   “This is the Ayah of the Sword” In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Ibn Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said,In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Ibn Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said, (I have been commanded to fight the people until they testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, establish the prayer and pay the Zakah.) This honorable Ayah (9:5) was called the Ayah of the Sword, about which Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim said, ""It abrogated every agreement of peace between the Prophet and any idolator, every treaty, and every term.'' Al-Awfi said that Ibn Abbas commented: ""No idolator had any more treaty or promise of safety ever since Surah Bara'ah was revealed. The four months, in addition to, all peace treaties conducted before Bara'ah was revealed and announced had ended by the tenth of the month of Rabi` Al-Akhir.''   .  Tafsir Ibn Abbas 109.6:    (Unto you your religion) of disbelief and ascribing partners to Allah, (and unto me my religion) Islam and faith in Allah. The verses of fighting then abrogated this and the Prophet (pbuh) did fight them'   .  Tafsir Al-Tustari 109.6:    (You have your religion and I have a religion). You have your choice (ikhtiyār) for your religion and I have my choice for a religion. Then [this verse] was abrogated by the verse of the sword [9:5]. His words, Exalted is He:   .  Tafsir Al-Jalalayn 109.6:    You have your religion, idolatry, and I have a religion', Islam: this was [revealed] before he was commanded to wage war [against the idolaters]   .  Tafsir Al-Jalalayn 8.61:    And if they incline to peace (read silm or salm, meaning, ‘settlement’), then incline to it, and conclude a pact with them: Ibn ‘Abbās said, ‘This has been abrogated by the “sword verse” [Q. 9:5]’; Mujāhid said, ‘This [stipulation] applies exclusively in the context of the People of the Scripture, for it was revealed regarding the Banū Qurayza; and rely on God, put your trust in Him; truly He is the Hearer, of words, the Knower, of actions.   .  Asbab Al-Nuzul by Al-Wahidi  2.256    ...This was before the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was commanded to fight the people of the Book. But then Allah's saying (There is no compulsion in religion…) was abrogated and the Prophet was commanded to fight the people of the Book in Surah Repentance”. ...   .  http://islamqa.info/en/34770   Other scholars said that this applied in the beginning, but was subsequently abrogated by Allaah’s command to fight and wage jihad. So whoever refuses to enter Islam should be fought when the Muslims are able to fight, until they either enter Islam or pay the jizyah if they are among the people who may pay jizyah. The kuffaar should be compelled to enter Islam if they are not people from whom the jizyah may be taken, because that will lead to their happiness and salvation in this world and in the Hereafter. Obliging a person to adhere to the truth in which is guidance and happiness is better for him than falsehood. Just as a person may be forced to do the duty that he owes to other people even if that is by means of imprisonment or beating, so forcing the kaafirs to believe in Allaah alone and enter into the religion of Islam is more important and more essential, because this will lead to their happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. This applies unless they are People of the Book, i.e., Jews and Christians, or Magians, because Islam says that these three groups may be given the choice: they may enter Islam or they may pay the jizyah and feel themselves subdued.   Some of the scholars are of the view that others may also be given the choice between Islam and jizyah, but the most correct view is that no others should be given this choice, rather these three groups are the only ones who may be given the choice, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fought the kuffaar in the Arabian Peninsula and he only accepted their becoming Muslim. And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):    “But if they repent [by rejecting Shirk (polytheism) and accept Islamic Monotheism] and perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah, then leave their way free. Verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Tawbah 9:5]    He did not say, “if they pay the jizyah”. The Jews, Christians and Magians are to be asked to enter Islam; if they refuse then they should be asked to pay the jizyah. If they refuse to pay the jizyah then the Muslims must fight them if they are able to do so. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):    “Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allaah, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger  (Muhammad), (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued” [al-Tawbah 9:29]    And it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted the jizyah from the Magians, but it was not proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) accepted the jizyah from anyone except the three groups mentioned above.   The basic principle concerning that is the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):    “And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allaah), and the religion (worship) will all be for Allaah Alone [in the whole of the world]” [al-Anfaal 8:39]   “Then when the Sacred Months (the 1st, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of the Islamic calendar) have passed, then kill the Mushrikoon (see V.2:105) wherever you find them, and capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush. But if they repent [by rejecting Shirk (polytheism) and accept Islamic Monotheism] and perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah, then leave their way free. Verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Tawbah 9:5]    This verse is known as Ayat al-Sayf (the verse of the sword).  These and similar verses abrogate the verses which say that there is no compulsion to become Muslim.    .  These are the opinions of MUSLIM scholars.  Over and over again the Quran claims to be a clear text, but this is obviously not the case."

BTW stop calling 'Tanwir al-miqbas min tafsir ibn abbas' to be """"Tafsir Ibn Abbaq"""", it's not authentic at all/  If you read the opening of the translation Tanweer al-Miqbaas min Tafseer Ibn ‘Abbaas it says: http://altafsir.com/Books/IbnAbbas.pdf (page 5):   There is no doubt that this commentary is not the work of Ibn ‘Abbas. The chain of transmitters of this commentary goes back to Muha mmad Ibn Marwan> al-Kalbi> Abu Salih which is described by Hadith experts as the chain of lies ( silsilat al-kadhib ), for this line of transmission is utterly dubious and unreliable. One does not even need to use the criteria for reliable transmission applied by Hadi th experts to decide this commentary’s wrong attribution to Ibn ‘Abbas. It is easy to detect obvious anomalies in the text of Tanwir al-Miqbas which leave one with no doubt that whoever wrote it lived many centuries after Ibn ‘Abbas. One finds it, for instance, references to Hasan al-Basri, al-Suddi and even the grammarian Yahya Ibn Ziyad al- Farra’ (d. 207/822). 6 In a few places, after giving different meanings of the same verse, the author(s) or compiler(s) proceed(s) to say: “... and this is the opin ion of Ibn ‘Abbas” or: “Ibn ‘Abbas says...”, forgetting that the entire commentary is supposed to be an accurate transmission of what is narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas.   Furthermore, Bilal Philips writes in his Book ""Usool At-Tafseer"" page 39:   Tafseer Ibn ‘Abbaas, Tanweer al-Miqbaas min Tafseer Ibn ‘Abbaas  This tafseer was compiled by Muhammad ibn Ya‘qoob al-Fayroozaabaadee (d. 1414 CE/817 AH), who was a Shaafi‘ee scholar and author of the famous Arabic dictionary, al-Qaamoos al-Muheet. The vast majority of this tafseer consists of explanatory statements attributed to the great sahaabee and mufassir, Ibn ‘Abbaas. The author mentions the chains of narrators for each section of tafseer. Hence, this tafseer is considered as being among the tafseers birriwaayah. However, chains of narration attributed to Ibn ‘Abbaas vary in their level of authenticity, depending upon the reliability of the narrators themselves. Chains from Mu‘aawiyah ibn Saalih and Qays ibn Muslim al-Koofee are considered saheeh (highly authentic) and those from Ibn Is-haaq (the historian) are considered hasan (authentic); while those from Ismaa‘eel ibn ‘Abdur- Rahmaan as-Suddee al-Kabeer and ‘Abdul Maalik ibn Jurayj are doubtful. Those from ad-Dahhaak ibn Mazaahim al-Hilaalee, ‘Ateeyah al-‘Awfee, Muqaatil ibn Sulaymaan al-Azdee, and Muhammad ibn as-Saa’ib al-Kalabee, who was accused of fabricating hadeeths, are all da‘eef (unacceptable). Nearly all of the so-called “Tafseer of Ibn ‘Abbaas” is based on statements narrated in chains containing Muhammad ibn as-Saa’ib al-Kalabee. Hence, this tafseer is considered unreliable for the most part; and, despite its popularity among the masses, it is totally rejected by Muslim scholars.      Asbab Al-Nuzul by Al-Wahidi 2.256  http://islamqa.info/en/34770   How does that prove anything when, as Ibn taymiyya said, there's a consensus that 2:256 wasn't abrogated and it was general in meaning?

A minority of Muslim scholars claimed that 2:256 was abrogated (some examples of such scholars can be found in tafsir al-Tabari, 2/256), and Al-Tabari debunked their claim in his tafsir proving that 2:256 wasn't abrogated."

I mean, I'm trying to recall what it was exactly that kept me up with excitement the night before Eid... Here's what I have so far:   My mom would decorate our basement with colorful string lights during Ramadan. We'd make paper lanterns and paper chains to put up as well. It made the atmosphere very festive. One Eid I had picked out new patent Mary Janes to wear with the rest of my outfit. That Eid outfit made my whole week. Something about waking up super early to get ready, piling into the car while reciting Eid takbirs, congregating with family and loved ones at the masjid... all made me feel warm and loved inside.  They always handed out Krispy Kreme donuts at the masjid, along with bags of candy and sometimes helium balloons.  We got Eid money from my dad. If we were around family, we'd always have a huge celebratory breakfast together to mark Ramadan's end.  We would spend the next couple of days driving from house to house and visiting people to wish them happy Eid. Sometimes Eid overlapped with school, and we were allowed to take the day off, which is always exciting.   As a kid, I was impervious to all of the adult stresses of the season... I could enjoy it for what it was, a really fun time to eat candy and mess around with my siblings. I think I'd still like to experience Eids like that.

First because the domestic upheaval caused by this frightening act of nature (these superstitious peoples will no doubt think it a punishment from god and flee from Mecca). Then the opportunism of Saudi funded fundamentalists like Al Qaeda and IS.  This in turn would trigger aggressive moves by Iran and Israel, both keen to keep a lid on the Sunni insanity as well as prevent the other from gaining control over the oil fields of Arabia.  The US would, no doubt, rapidly intervene to take the oil fields under its control. Which would probably be challenged by the BRICS as well as by Germany. So, the US would seek some UN/NATO cover and end up putting together some coalition of powers to govern the region.

There aren't different versions of the rules floating around that can be confusing. If I need help, I can go to a lawyer and get a good idea on what's going to cross the line.  Now Muslims believe, that Allah had to release a newer version of the rules that superseded the previous version (since somehow, humans were able to corrupt ""Allah the Powerful's"" previous books). However, Allah for some reason is incapable of mass DELETING all the old versions of his rule set. How can he be the master of the Universe if he has to rely on human followers to KILL or otherwise SUBJUGATE other humans that are following the ""previous"" rule book???????????   Furthermore, if I need guidance even within Islam on when to open/break fast, what to do when dealing with excessive long fasting hours?, when to celebrate eid?, if I go to Muslim scholars, I will get very significantly varying answers depending on the school of thought, sect (shia vs sunni) and the sub-sect within it. They all claim to be deriving it from the same sources. For an Allah to justifiably put anyone in hell for eternity, the rulebook has to be clear, free from ambiguity and he has to absolutely ensure that there exists just ONE rulebook for all to follow. It cannot be the job of the humans to go around killing or otherwise subjugating other people with previous ""divine"" mandates coz, then ""Might is Right""."

There's plenty of reasons, just like Israel's sponsoring of Hamas back in the '70s.  The main thing to note is that our contexts are different. The Western governments are not in a fight with Islamic extremists, the Islamists don't represent a credible threat to them at all. It sells papers and asks important moral questions, but at the end of the day, it's like a handful of flies attacking a lion.  The public's context is set by the news media and that is all about terror alerts, threats, foiled plots and foreign regimes bent on war with The West ... That's good for the media (cheap content, excitement, relevance, advertising) and for the government (distraction and fear-based conformity) and for the Islamists (the appearance of credibility and power, drive up membership, encourage ""moderate"" Muslims to be more assertive and fascist).

A couple of decades of things like this would have been unfathomable. People would have thought that atheist/agnostics are satan incarnate, but see what is happening now. Religious people are gradually dropping their fallacies and recognizing atheism as conscious choice and acceptable position to hold. Even Muslims are recognizing that exmuslims leave islam because of fundamental disagreement with the tenets of faith rather than to 'enjoy life'. Such a progress has been possible only due to being vocal about it. What causes in history have been acheived by being silent about them? Apostasy (Freedom of conscience) has to be made an acceptable position in the muslim society."

I don't want to pretend that my boyfriend converted to Islam and have HIM lie as well. It's a matter of keeping things simple.   And to be honest, it's also a matter of just living.

They lived there for over 3500 years and now muslims want it cuz of their gutter religion.
exmuslim,3d2ez8,Mojomaniac666,2,Mon Jul 13 00:54:45 2015 UTC,"You're 100% wrong about this being only a religious issue. Palestinians call themselves Palestinians because of the Philistines that lived during the times of Biblical Israel. Although there is no genetic relation between the Roman Philistine and Semites (Canaanites/Ishmaelites/Jews/Arabized Arabs), many Semites that still lived in the area and carried the name Palestina post-Judea after many Jews were expelled by the Romans. Eventually, Muslims conquered and the Semites/Samaritans/Jews continued to use the name but eventually converted to Islam because of persecution.   Now, Palestinians today (whether Muslims or Christian) are descendants from not only the Pure Arab-Muslim tribes that conquered but from the Samaritans/Semitic people that lived during biblical times. Obviously, that is why we refer to each other as cousins because we're fucking descendants from Jews/Samaritans as well. The Palestinians Arabs of Palestine today are just as connected to the land as the Middle Eastern Jews that lived in Judea-Samaria.   Yes, there's been a crap ton of race mixing but they do have ancestral connections. This is where conflict arises, the influx of European Jews to Palestine caused an uproar because many believed didn't have as much connection to the land other than what most believed to be ""religious right"". They were seen as colonists. Genetically, there's evidence that states they're products of just converts (which has always been a controversy) and there's also evidence that some families have direct links. Genealogy studies are still being done to this day. Palestinians Jews and Arabs did live together in harmony for a while but it wasn't until Zionism and the influx of European Jews that the conflict began to take shape. This issue is MAINLY political, so no need to give bullshit responses."
exmuslim,3d2ez8,Meerooo,-1,Tue Jul 14 11:44:06 2015 UTC,"Completely wrong. First, there are no 'palestinian people' . King Herod, who btw hated Jews,  already proclaimed the people of Judea and Samara, i.e. Palestine, were Jews. There's dicuments proving this. King Salomon already built his temple there 2000 BC, which was later destroyed by the Romans and then by the Muslims. Today's 'Palestinians' are all immigrants from all over the area who arrived in the 18. century, resettled by the Ottoman emoure. Mist if theoalestinian last names still show where they initially came from."

Palestinian Arabs have just as much connection to the land as Middle Eastern (now Israeli) Jews given their vast genetic similarities. Personally, my lineage first starts when the pure-Arabs first controlled Palestine and race mixing with Samaritans began in the Nablus area. Centuries later you have an influx of Arab immigrants from surrounding lands, but the truth still holds; there were people that identified themselves as Palestinians that have always lived in the lands and have ancestral ties. Most converted to avoid persecution and stuck with their new religions as they mixed, but a vast minority did stay with their Samaritan identity. There are Samaritan origins amongst the Palestinian people."

If you are talking about ancient Israel they were destroyed and dispersed by Babylonians and romans and have never really returned to it before the 19th century. Jews have no claim to that land anymore, because by the same logic that land belongs to the original non-jewish semites of the bronze age.   Muslims only came there recently, in the 19.. century   *7th century.  If you want to know who really owns that land...  That is the nature of the region is that whoever can defend it get's to keep it.

There were also hundreds of thousands of people before conflicts and wars erupted in the region.That's exactly what I stated above, but the lands were called Palestine at the time, and it's inhabitants were called Palestinians as much as people try to refute it.   There was an influx of immigrants during the 19th century, but it has yet refuted the fact that Palestinian Arabs/Christians/Jews/Muslims didn't exist in the lands, in fact, your article actually supports it. His timeline starts during the 19th century and he is attempting to debunk a myth by emphasizing that Palestine was completely empty and only consisted of ""Israeli"" Jews which is false since he also never fully admits to there never being Palestinian Arabs.

In the Islamology revival of the 1970s when academics started turning to autopsy Islamic scripture and dogma, so to did Islamic science miracles appear.   In all cases its an attempt to incorporate and co-opt science into the service of theology to bolster public image. For Islam, it specifically shows how long clerics had the monopoly control over Islamic studies is that the best apologetics and explanations Muslim scholars have ever produced are warmed over Christian arguments from Augustine and William Lane Craig.

exmuslim,3czham,Vallentain,0,Sun Jul 12 11:55:01 2015 UTC,"As do many Hindus and Christians. They ignore the fact that those achievements are by human endeavour but instead attribute them to divine providence.   I fear a large part of this is due to the fact that there is poor historical representation. In order to make themselves feel more relevant when compared to all the ""Christians"" we know about they embellish achievements.   Remember for a huge part of history Christianity helped destroy the achievements of other cultures so a lot about their history has been lost and such is the dominance of ideas like ""One English Book is more Valuable than all the Books in India"" have lead to a gap in our knowledge that many people try to fill with embellished achievements.   Let's look at a simple thing from two cultures. Samurai Swords vs Indian Swords. Ever wonder why Samurai Swords are considered something nearly magical? Yet when described most soldiers considered the Indian made swords and their handles (they force you to fight a certain way that's more effective) to be better. Almost impressively powerful at slicing things apart. That whole ""you can cut a guy in half"" thing can be done with that sort of blade. Damascus steel was created out of the same technique but Indians kept using their special handles that meant their swords were easier to use correctly. It was a very interesting visit to the Royal Armouries when I learnt this.  But why is one nearly magical in its treatment while the other is not? Just how one was treated by a lot of Japanophiles Post WW II and how the other's manufacture was lost to history (No one quite knows how Damascus steel and Wootz steel was made. We lost the ability to make them.). Indians were often considered as savages and barbarians. It's why we consider the ""Traditional Japan"" to be a place of incredible culture and learning while Indian arts were often rubbished.   The tragedy of this?   Everyone knows Karate. The Indian Martial arts are mostly dead. There are a handful of practitioners left. A huge chunk of Indian history is lost. While the Japanese and indeed the world can name people like Tokugawa and at least some parts of the Sengoku Jidai. We cannot talk of the Khilji Dynasty's successful defence against the Mongol Empire. We cannot talk about the campaigns of Maurya.   The tragedy is we have lost a huge chunk of knowledge from South Asia that is as rich as places like South East Asia that we simply don't learn. And this is even in India! Most Indians don't realise that there are traditional martial arts and even when they are practiced they are akin to magic rather than the more sensible origins of things like Indian Boxing (which is basically a more full contact form of Muai Thai), Wrestling (Seriously? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gama This guy is more known in freaking Japan than in India.) or the other martial arts.

So long as you extract them from Islamic world they can be successful?  The Indians didn't land a probe on mars. They launched a probe into space for nothing, because the probe itself is worthless, ancient tech and will tell us nothing new. Also they pay a fraction of what NASA pays. The actual story is how they've driven down the cost of launching things into space. But that isn't a sexy story so people like you wouldn't understand it. India did this as Europe landed an actually useful probe on an actual moving comet.   Finally the stigma against non-English speakers doesn't need to be overcome. Every one of those people you linked I guarantee speaks English and probably does science in English.

Yep... all Indian languages are good for are dance moves and unrealistic movie physics...  Because of your complete ignorance of other languages and your belief that other languages don't have words for technical things.   IF a German can publish in German and get taken seriously, so should Asians and Afrikaans. Hell? I work around Brits here. their grasp of Tamil is fucking atrocious. Does that mean they are inherently incapable of speaking two languages without mutilating one? No? It just means that I have two advantages. An existing knowledge of a language for longer and more exposure to the culture and a natural grasp for languages that means I pick up languages faster. Not because there is some inherent fucking in the British, Australian, German, French and Americans who have worked alongside me.   Once you realise that people who don't speak your language are just as smart as you and can write scientific papers even if the langauge is a bit dated or not upto your level, then you will begin to see an equality between the two.   Incidentally? Want to know a funny story. I got reported once for speaking English with a foreign accent. It was ""hard to understand"". I speak with an Edinburgh accent.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9hluC75MX0  Yeah... foreign accent. The funny bit is the person they complained to had the same accent. So they complained about an Asian doctor to HR that I had a really strong foreign accent that made it totally impossible to understand me despite the fact I was born and lived until the age of 24 in the UK to someone with the same accent and at no point did they think ""Hang on"".   That my friend is what the Stigma is about.   The West's been plundering other cultures for those achievements that created the wealth needed for those things you take for granted.

Because Germany (or German language) has the scientific muscle to get it's language noticed. Asia and Africa are two CONTINENTS, not nations, again split by hundreds of languages.  Guess what. All you're feelsies arguments can be dismissed with one word: Efficiency. In science it trumps your clearly emotional bias. Standards are efficient. Multi-cultural diversity is not. Boo-hoo. If you think you're being discriminated against in the West go back to whatever your homeland is and taste some real racism.   Please, the West didn't plunder and pillage, colonialism couldn't even match the brutality of the local governments it overthrew. I don't take for granted what I have. You have failed to refute any of my comments. All your examples are trained in the West, and India outright didn't land anything on mars, they shot an outdated probe into space. Also what does this have to do with ex-muslim?  Total English Speakers are at 841 million actually. Also Indian and Arabic and Spanish and Chinese will never be accepted as the standardized language of science. Know why? Because you can't expect to move to those nations and be given a fair shot. English is attractive in more ways than its critics seem to realize, it's attached to the wealthiest most technologically advanced and most tolerant nations on earth where you can go, learn English, and become successful. Something the 'Asian' (continent) languages don't offer.

Also the vast majority of scientific papers being submitted within or from India/China and in those languages, are bunk.

Though honestly getting your paper noticed is mostly related to your schooling, and associates who will back it up.  There are good Chinese and Indian scientific centers, but most of those nations scientists are trained in the west.   Yawn People died in the war.

Slavery? India was (is) way into slavery, that's what the caste system is. Don't like the West or its culture? Don't associate with it or us. Go embrace a racist, sexism, nepotist culture for all I care that values superstitions over studying facts. An Indian who is 'proud to be Indian' is lecturing others on how a culture needs to treat people fairly? What a joke.

The atrocities in Asia were merely repeated a few decades later and Asia was left ravaged by centuries of exploitation not ""10 years of war"" and Asia's scars of war were much larger  than Europe's.

You cannot  claim white people were the ones to remove Apartheid when it was people like Gandhi, King and Mandela who fought against it. And no there was no such practice in France. Hell?

You know, we know, and shit, even they probably know that all of those statements are far too vague and open to even possibly have any real value to the wider world. The only people who take the Quran as an authority on the physical world, are doing it because they've been conditioned to take it as an authority on life.

But it sucks having to be in the closet in my own place and then be subjected to some fairy tales concocted, hallucinated and plagiarised from other myths by a desert dwelling douche 1400+ years ago. If I could afford it, I'd get them their own place. What sucks is they are still able to, but won't work, and want to spend money they don't have, and then also want to pay zakkat whereas they are flat broke and could benefit from zakkat themselves. It's all predestined  according to them per Allah's will though them sleeping all day and wasting time in prayer has nothing to do with their situation. Of course, I do love them, but they test this every day. Having said that, my heart goes out to those ex Muslims who are dependent on their parents and subjected to much worse, especially emotionally."

Here are some issues:   How did you conclude that Jinn possession was the cause? Do you know that Jinns exist? Is there any evidence?  How did you rule out mental illness, schizophrenia, epilepsy, seizure or some other mental condition?  How did you rule out that he was play acting or faking? Someone recorded this. Could have been a prank.   Demon possessions are claimed all around the world. Some people cast out demons in the name of Jesus, some in Allah,  some in Krsna. So do all these Gods have the power to cast out demons?  It usually happens in countries with uneducated people and almost always turns out to be mental illness or epilepsy. There is not one reliable demonstration of a demon possession out there, no proof that demons exist and no reason to suspect they do. Surely if someone could produce evidence of demons, it would be front page news and the person could make a fortune off books and interviews. I invite you to do the research yourself and find one scientific journal article documenting the existence of demons that is well accepted by the scientific community.    Let's say it was a Jinn (and it's obviously not). Does that make Islam true? Jinns actually predate Islam and are part of Pagan Arab mythology. Maybe Arab Paganism is true and the demon is scared of Allah (Allah was worshipped by pre-Islamic Arab Pagans).  See here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn"

What radical anti-Islam people often don't understand is that you can't make sweeping changes to society and expect them to stick. Turning Hijab from a black trash bag to hide every aspect of your Haraam body into a fashion statement is a baby step towards making women in Islam a little bit more liberal.  As time goes on, and with contact with the Western world, one can hope that they become more liberal in other areas of their thinking as well. For instance, I love in a country where Muslim women often wear fashionable hijabs in bright colours like this girl over here. Intellectually they are far more liberal than the trash bag wearers who think that everything in the 'Dunya' is a sin."

Remember they can not masturbate and they can not drink so that makes for a lot of hormones raging inside.

exmuslim,3cxfhk,egokuu,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:57:23 2015 UTC,"Ok how does a local flood which happens all over the world is comparable with 26 miles of water covering the planet for a whole year? Mohammed borrowed the jewish and christian myth and kept the same people in the story...but what he failed to realize is that the flood is an allegory, a moral homily about new beginnings and starting over and about redemption and NOT a historical even. For crying out lout it was originally from the Epic of Gilgamesh which is what? 3000 years old and mentions only a local flood?  Local floods are not the same again as 26 miles of water covering the earth for a year or even a day or week. The mental gymnastic involved to accept a global flood only says one thing: People who believe in it never completed High school physics and chemistry classes which is exactly what happens to your typical Muslim (in terms of worldwide education in islamic countries). You can deny what you don t know is stupid and incompatible with modern science and this is why extremists being insecure and uneducated want to get rid of science and education"

Just posting the article title and subtitle for people who are curious but don't want to follow the link.

Third - and most importantly - it assumes that people aren't going to evolve into anything else. Don't forget, our parents and ourselves used to be Muslim, but we left Islam. It's too much of an assumption (an unwarranted one too) that folks won't leave Islam or become someone who follows what barely resembles the kind of Islam that makes the author uncomfortable (justifiably so).  New generations bring new ideas, that's how societies evolve. Accepting gay rights was something that was not even present in the list of possible things to happen to my parents generation. The very next generation (mine) sees a decent amount of support for gay rights, even from Muslim family members.

On the other hand, coming here and saying that you don't give a fuck about other peoples' issues because they didn't respond to your topic seems egotistic and self centred.

Like I said, there could be many reasons for it, and I wouldn't take it too personally. I did read through it at the time and thought that what you're discussing is interesting, but what you were asking and trying to communicate wasn't very clear. I think also your phrasing was far too academic for a forum that is filled mostly with young people aged 16-25, most of whom are looking for emotional support and a rant space. There ARE those here who are interested in discussion (like myself) but we're not that common.  I think the topic you posted would fare better in a different home. Perhaps on the SubReddits for DebateReligion or Psychology? I actually invite you to repost the topic again at a later date, but perhaps phrase it a bit more colloquially and make it clearer what you're asking. The impression I got was that you wanted to discuss the psychological differences between focusing on the result versus focusing on the process and perhaps apply it to the way we think about rewards in the afterlife. This is a very subtle distinction (being a good person because goodness itself is rewarding versus goodness for a tangible reward), perhaps too subtle for most people here.   I won't be initiating any topic of discussion in the near future and ranting and whining is not my style.   I'm sorry to hear that.

exmuslim,3cx14q,Twiceadopted,8,Sat Jul 11 17:54:15 2015 UTC,"She came from a poor background of Islam. This is where a lot of the problems within Islam are. A mix of a lack of real education, religion taking on the role of teacher and a lack of opportunities means that she came from a problematic childhood and life.   One can argue that a huge problem with Islam is an unwillingness to realise that Mohammed is not a good role model. And that some of his actions are quite bad by today's standards. In trying to ape Mohammed a lot of Muslims don't realise but they are crippling intellectual development. They are adopting ideas that are inherently harmful. Just 3 examples? Fine. Madrassas that cripple Muslim boys and their grasp of science, A conservative mindset that has effectively betrayed any lofty ""equalist"" phrases within Islam and banished women to a minor role within the faith and finally, a dislike of ""idol worship"" which has lead to massive inter faith violence leading to deaths of millions.

exmuslim,3cx14q,Twiceadopted,5,Sat Jul 11 21:48:07 2015 UTC,That's nice. I came from a well off family.   I however nearly lost my leg in the first Gulf War. And there are plenty of well educated women made to marry thuggish men. My aunt was married off to a man who hit her for 13 years and eventually damaged her kidneys. She died of Renal Failure 10 years later. She's was a doctor. Sometimes it doesn't matter what education you have and how well off you are.
exmuslim,3cx14q,Anandya,-2,Sat Jul 11 23:28:10 2015 UTC,"sure there are quiet a few unfortunate cases. Neither am I questioning that a well educated woman can not be abused.   Infact all of what I have stated thus far is specific to Ayan Hirsi Ali. She told the dutch government that she ran from somalia, had a poor family, she was escaping war, etc. When infact, she immigrated from a very comfortable lifestyle in Kenya, Great living conditions, great education. She married a dude from Canada, Who after marrying her sent her money and eventually got her approved to immigrate to Canada. She used his money but decided to stay in Netherlands. Her husband and her father visited her multiple times. They were always in contact with her. They would stay with her often when visiting. The guy on her request divorced her. She falsified forced Marriage. She made false allegation about her father wanting to perform honor killing on her for some reason. She also mentioned her brothers being after her. She claimed that she was running from her brother and husband and she was in hiding from them.   All of these claims have been systematically proven false."
exmuslim,3cx14q,Twiceadopted,6,Sun Jul 12 01:54:21 2015 UTC,"She never said her family was poor... She was fleeing Somalia cause her father was imprisoned for being a political dissident. Her father didn't think it was a health place for a young girl to grow up particularly since she had Female Genital Mutilation done to her when he was in prison. He was opposed to the practice but her grandmother did it.   After he escaped from gaol, they fled to a bunch of countries finally ending up in Nairobi. She had a proper ""Islamic education"" including a Wahabbist teacher. She adopted their ideas  Hell she sympathised with the Muslim Brotherhood and even the Fatwa of Rushdie. But that's the damn point, people change. You weren't born to atheist parents. You were not born a skeptic. You probably had parents that were religious and inculcated those ideas into you as you grew up just as easily as they taught you your first language.   And Ayan Hirsi Ali was fleeing a forced marriage. The literal argument here was ""no you weren't"" which is the same argument used by people in any shotgun wedding across the planet.   And there is a difference between visiting someone and going home with them. I am afraid your literal argument was a claim made by opposition leaders who stated that ""She had lied about her Asylum because she was from Kenya rather than Somalia despite her having Somalian Citizenship"". To which the response is ""Since when is Somalia and Kenya the same"", one may as well argue that Holland and Germany are the same. She didn't get Asylum because she was Somalian, she got it because she was fleeing an arranged marriage.   In the same way that Salman Rushdie did not get asylum because he was Indian but because a lot of people wanted him dead."

So, your comment about getting down voted here as a result of speaking out against here is probably not that, as you're doing just that below without receiving any large amount of down votes.   So, no, I didn't miss that part. However, you started your contribution to the thread with a substanceless post about her being a liar. That's your problem.

I made a factual statement that isn't lesser known about her. If anybody has actually tried to read up on her and the controversies that often surround her, they wouldn't need source for common knowledge factual statements. Since her articles and vids appear in this sub on a regular bases, I'm at least expecting the vast majority in the sub to know about her and have a retention memory longer then the day a new article is posted."
exmuslim,3cx14q,Twiceadopted,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:09:54 2015 UTC,"Firstly, your comment here indicated that because you were ""speaking publicly"", you were getting downvoted. I don't think that's the case and that it's more likely a lack of any substance that's the problem. I hope you'll agree with this assessment.  Secondly, even though you are not getting downvoted below where you are arguing with some actual substance, it's very possible that people are not acknowledging her ""lies"".  However, when you start out with a post saying ""she's a liar"", there are two possible roles this could fill in this sub: either, you're preaching to a choir of people who already agree with that statement (like what you ""expect"" from this sub), in which case, the comment is only fluff, and, as I said, ""preaching to the choir"". If, however, the sub is unaware of her faults and potential lies, the comment is still lacking as it does nothing but make a claim with nothing to back it up (at least not in that initial comment, which, it should).  Now, whether or not she actually is a controversial, lying figure, that's of course a problem in itself. I myself is neither muslim or exmuslim and haven't read any of her books. I'm interested in what you're saying however, and will definitely look into it. That being said, it's possible to make good, well-reasoned, logical claims about an issue, while still being a shitty person. If a nazi-sympathizer says that global warming is, in fact, a problem, and supplies a well reasoned, logical argument for this that is backed up by evidence, the fact that he/she is a nazi-sympathizer should have no impact on their arguments. Arguing that they would is just ad hominem.   So, I grant you that it's very possibly so that AHA has lied about things in the past, and that she may be a bad, deceitful person, I genuinely don't know. I don't think, however, that a blanket response to everything she says after that point is satisfactory or interesting.  Still, this is reddit, and if you want to take any opportunity to ""enlighten"" the community about these things, you are of course very welcome to do so. However, I would probably benefit you, karma-wise, to indicate that you are not necessarily disagreeing with her statements made in this video, but rather with her as a person.  In addition, it would probably benefit you to start with some substance, up front."

My highest rated comment on /r/exmuslim was about how a particular post I was commenting on dealt with historical aspects of Islam that may be problematic, that it was refreshing to see such content and that we need more of it.

So, as a first step, I think it's good idea that you and the rest of you guys acknowledge the indisputable fact that Hirsi Ali is, in fact, a prolific liar. Secondly, as far as this video is concerned what she says is vaguely true-ish in a very childish and trivial way, if your desired level of discourse is trolling the porters on the streets of Cairo. Quite honestly, she is just vulgar. We need a better atheism."

You were upset about the fact of Hirsi Ali being a prolific liar. The fact that her lies are pretty much common knowledge in the community notwithstanding, they're thoroughly referenced in this very thread. You were also upset that her character doesn't necessarily have to do with the content of her claims and I explained to you that the those, too, are very vulgar."
exmuslim,3cx14q,livelongandprosper-,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"You assume too much.  I have very little knowledge of Hirsi Ali, as I've said. I could not care less if Hirsi Ali is a liar, or if she's being called a liar. My problem was only about the way he argued the point, in that he made a strong factual claim without evidence and proceeded to lament the fact that he was getting downvoted. I simply explained to him why that was the case, at least for that comment as he did supply substance further down in the commenting tree.   It's also a logical fallacy to assume that because someone is of a certain, potentially lacking, character, their arguments are necessarily flawed. So whether or not her lies are undisputable and well-referenced in this thread, they say very little about the substance of her arguments.  If I am ""upset"" by anything, it was poor reasoning, not the aim of the arguments.   Also, as a non-muslim, non-ex-muslim, with little insight into Hirsi Ali, my only problem is with statements like these:   Secondly, as far as this video is concerned what she says is vaguely true-ish in a very childish and trivial way, if your desired level of discourse is trolling the porters on the streets of Cairo. Quite honestly, she is just vulgar.    Again, lacking substance, summed up as ""childish, border-line untrue, trolling"". I don't think it's too much to ask for that you simply expand on your points and explain why you believe those to be the correct conclusions about her statements. Indeed, it seems we do need better atheism."
exmuslim,3cx14q,Igortheinvincible,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:58:52 2015 UTC,"On a side note, your personal preference for ignoring whether Hirsi Ali is, in fact, a prolific liar or not, is duly noted. However, you should keep in mind that this person, that you admit are not familiar with, is mostly concerned with normative, ethical questions. Whether a person is a prolific liar or not may be irrelevant if that person is a physicist but it's not if he or she is an ethicist. I'm sure a man who is fond of logic understands this point very well."

I have been, unsuccessfully, trying to get the point across that 1- the claim that she is a prolific liar is something that can and should be evaluated independently. This has been done in this very thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/3cx14q/ayaan_hirsi_ali_on_mohammed_the_antiinnovator/ct01tci 2- About the content of what she says in this video (which I regard as independent of point (1) above), I explained to you that her point is true-ish in a very trivial and childish sense. The only new information you have so far provided is a demand that I elaborate on why I described her claims as vulgar. That's a legitimate question. The problem is I don't know how familiar you are with Islamic culture. This is not very easy to explain without cultural references that Igors of the world (being not from Muslim-majority countries, usually) do not typically understand. So, if you tell me approximately how familiar you are with the subject (e.g. totally ignorant, somewhat familiar, total nerd) I'd be able to elaborate."

exmuslim,3cxn20,HeavyHone,16,Sat Jul 11 18:18:21 2015 UTC,"Apologists have huge liberties when writing such articles.   Science documentation and islam documentation (quran/hadith) are huge. As a consequence, the author can pick any idea from both documentation and make them correlate to validate his point. Cf Texas Sharpshooter fallacy You can always find a way to tell that some vague affirmation is true via interpretation. That's a huge liberty. Example : ""This universe is like a carrousel"" (oh it's turning, look at the galaxies they have spiral shapes and planets turn... Also it's mechanical and predictible, wow this sentence brings so much knowledge) You have some more liberty via the translation. A word can have different meanings so they can pick the best translation for their idea. By doing that, they can even more easily make the quran say whatever suits them.    Also, in a lot of cases, you can ask yourself : ""Could God tell us that idea with more accuracy ?"" and the answer will often be yes.   I just read diagonally but here is one small rebuttal :    O humans! Be pious (careful of your duty) to your Lord, Who created you from a single self (soul), and from it He created its mate, and from them He has spread a multitude of men and women (Al-Nissa, 4: 1).  This verse tells us that the beginning of life was a single self (soul), then its mate came out of it. Biological science tells us that the earliest form of life was represented by single cell organisms found in water, then these multiplied by splitting themselves.   Here he chooses to highlight the translation ""self"" instead of ""soul"" but whatever. I think his idea contradicts another one in Islam. The human baby receives his soul after like 4 weeks in the mother womb. But in the author's mind here, conveniently, the ""single cell"" has a self/soul.    Keep in mind that Mo' could have simply been a good guesser/observer. So he can get some things right just by using his intuition or common knowledge from his age, and then extrapolate or making up vague ideas that should be/seem correct. I also like the hypocrisy of the scholars.  When you try to interpret a verse in the quran, everyone's jumping at you ""Nope you should read the tafsir. Also it should be coherent with every other hadith/verses so you also have to be a scholar. Also if something is wrong, then you must have interpret it incorrectly.  Oh, and you don't know the invisible knowledge (3ilm lrhayb), and we can't pretend to know what Allah means. It's risky to say anything because you might make an incorrect interpretation of what Allah is trying to say"". However, when it comes to showing ""quran = science"", then it's free-for-all and everything is accepted.   And there's a lot more things to say..."

Why does he even need water molecules at all then? Its only when you look at scripture through the eyes of an educated person that you realize the people in antiquity who wrote those stories knew nothing about science and physics and that is why it is very easy to dismiss religions as nonsense.  Islam is a 7th century rewrite of the Bible which itself was composed of many older books put together and rewriten in 1611 to create the new Testament. Do you really believe that an Angel took 23 years to teach an illiterate desert sheep herder when he could have visited the Chinese or even the Egyptians with that knowledge and help spread the religion even better, faster and to millions more followers? No! it had to be an illiterate warlord in a remote part of the world way after the Greek and Roman civilizations passed from polytheism to monotheism.  Mohammed saw that he could rally his people because the Roman nations had a god and the Jews had a God so he saw this as an opportunity and took a long time to put all his thinking and rewriting of the bible down.  Ask yourself why God had to take 23 years to show himself to an illiterate man instead of through an advanced civilization. Religion is a means to control people and it was invented by man to explain what man could not explain. Thunder...must be god. Floods...must be god. The moon half lit...must be god. Education is how you learn about the world, with tested facts and science not ancient myth, allegories and moral homilies. You have access to knowlege, you can think for yourself and you can use your critical thinking skills. Ask yourself why there are so many religions, why they all claim they are the right ones and how come the only one real God has so many variations and different origins through the last 200.000+ years. Ask yourself why God is not willing or capable of showing himself now? Why is faith needed when nothing about religion is demonstrable."

Typical Confirmation Bias.   ...Also, Koran took things from Christianity and Judaism so who should REALLY get the credit?  ...Also, using this same confirmation bias I can find just as many scientific examples for several other religions, so now the question becomes again:  Which religion with all these 'scientific predictions' is the REAL religion? There's an EQUAL chance for all these other religions as well (Google scientific proof of: Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism etc. you'll find just as much information.).  The best way to go about finding the 'one true religion' is probably by a process of elimination.  For ME out of all of the big 3 monotheistic ones, the Koran is the MOST DEBUNKABLE. Mainly because it makes the bold and extremely fragile claim that the book and the prophet is infallible and with that statement, you can take any 1 false/uneducated statement and pop that claim like a balloon (one of MANY which ways are scientific ).  Maybe this will help you realize how easy it is to debunk Islam. Honestly I don't know why people don't think about these things before choosing a religion they are supposed to submit their whole lives to.   https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/30hm8g/atheist_here_for_the_most_part_what_do_you_guys/       ...And remember, if you're choosing religion as a way to have SOMETHING to cling to because the fear of death is intense then essentially you've fallen victim to whomever originated this religion to tool the masses into 'staying in line' so they can be at the top. Ever wonder why Mohammed gets all the perks and doesn't even hide it in the Koran?   Something is definitely fishy there and it's eerily similar to how cult leaders act and conveniently take resources by claiming 'originality perks' (Money, sex, power. Every single time).

Some of the interpretations are just shamelessly wrong, for example this one: We have built the heaven with (the power of Our) hands, and We are expanding (it).  The actual verse says ""We have built the sky with (the power of Our) hands, and We are capable"" when you revert back to authentic Arabic dictionaries (e.g. الصحاح، لسان العرب), not the modern ones.  But let's assume that there are accurate scientific miracles in the Quran or any old text, let's not forget that there are always other explanations than ""God"" so why did you choose that one?  Other explanations that are just as probable as ""God"", if not more, include advanced civilizations that disappeared leaving traces of knowledge, or simply aliens! What makes God more probable than aliens?   Also, the same verses used in that article can be used to prove any number of things. Let's assume science proved reincarnation to be true, Muslims can simply use the verse they used for Evolution here ""Do they not see how Allah begins the Creation, then repeats it?"" and claim they have known about reincarnation all along."

On the other hand, scientific errors are far more direct interpretation of the text. You need to tweek the meaning here or there to get out of the error. One glaring example is the verse about the sun setting in a muddy spring.  If you feel content with the logic they present, by all means stay a Muslim.

The series of many forces interacting with each other, rather than ""one all-powerful, unknowable god did it"".  Plus the pagan gods are flawed, which is much better."
exmuslim,3cw51x,GodsAreTired,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:43:36 2015 UTC,"Plato in Republic taught that the Gods should be taught to the youth as entirely good:  ""We will not have them trying to persuade our youth that the gods are the authors of evil, and that heroes are no better than men—sentiments which, as we were saying, are neither pious nor true, for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods."""
exmuslim,3cw51x,scientus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:27:00 2015 UTC,Plato was just an individual though. The strength of Paganism was in the lack of centralised/official doctrine so people had a great deal of intellectual freedom
exmuslim,3cw51x,GodsAreTired,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:19:53 2015 UTC,"Plato's Republic is the foundation of most governments. What I am saying is that that is also why the Abrahamic God is presented as genuinely good, even though anyone that has read the Bible knows that this is kinda silly. I am not refuting you, but you should understand what Plato was saying. Saying that Plato or Socrates was ""just an individual"" is like saying Mohammed was just an individual."
exmuslim,3cw51x,scientus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:10:15 2015 UTC,The difference being that not even pagans thought Plato was anything more than another individual with another viewpoint. Muslims view Mohammed as a prophet of the divine whose word is law.   Also I think that old German traditions have more to do with the foundation of modern Democracy.

For some reason the US doesn't want to admit to its British heritage so they have this weird faux-neoclassicism. David Starkey did a great speech on this."

exmuslim,3cw51x,scientus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:51:54 2015 UTC,"Not really. The Germanic peoples had a democratic tradition long before Caesar conquered Gaul, let alone before it was called France. It was sort of a proto-constitutional monarchy.   At the time of the Norman conquest France was an absolute monarchy with a strong regional nobility. It took some time for England, then later Britain to strike the right balance of constitutional monarchy again."

Concomitant internalized misogyny which comes from deciding to wear the hijab is very difficult to get rid of. It's almost as if you have to reconcile wearing the hijab with fitting in with the West, which is again a hard task.   Consider muslim women who have never taken off the hijab; in fact consider ex-Muslim women who still cannot fathom taking off the hijab.   It is not our duty and it shouldn't be our goal to further ostracize and make these women feel as if they don't belong. Rather, the right thing to do is look beyond the hijab, make the hijab seem as if it ISN'T her identifying or defining characteristic, which will hopefully result in her shedding the hijab."
exmuslim,3cx7ki,callipygia,-2,Sat Jul 11 16:35:45 2015 UTC,Bullshit.  It's nobody's duty to coddle somebody's mental problems.

exmuslim,3cx7ki,MohammedRidesAgain,2,Sat Jul 11 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"Heh, now you're twisting my words. You mentioned ""mental problems"" in your previous comment, and down syndrome is a mental problem. Never in that comment did I imply that ""down syndrome= hijabi anxiety.""  But there you go again, simplifying the issue. It's not just ""hijabi anxiety,"" it's a full fledged identity crisis which stems from people like you who make women feel as if they don't belong. Of course, if they get treated as if they don't belong, they will retrear into the opposite corner of Islam which gives them solace in wearing the hijab.  Hell, this woman in the article seems as if she is on the cusp as well. She doesn't want to be defined by her hijab; and what is really wrong with that?   I would like to hear an ex-hijabi's opinion on this as well, because I assure you the hijab question is more than just ""hijabi anxiety."""
exmuslim,3cx7ki,callipygia,2,Sat Jul 11 17:13:43 2015 UTC,"You're the one making the equivalence, literally. I'm drawing attention to the absurdity of such and to the broader absurdity of emotion-led ""argument"".  Can you prove any of this ""identity crisis"" nonsense? I mean besides the woman saying ""I have an anxiety"", because I doubt self diagnosis is a sound basis for arguing for social change.  And even so, why should another society embrace your mental issues and tread around your mental problems?  Of course hijabis don't belong, it's silly sods like you that make bizarre arguments that bring this about.  Hijabis don't belong in The West, I don't belong in The West. Fuck I don't even belong in India, as all the Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and even Middle Eastern people I have ever met think I'm not Indian.  She is defined by her hijab, because an overtly political message is the intention of the Hijab. Muslims want to communicate to non-muslims (and themselves) that they are different, have superior morals etc etc, by the wearing of the hijab. So yes, she wears it in a non Muslims society, she will be seen as another muslim communicating the same message. If anyone needs to change it is the Muslims, they're the ones creating and communicating this message.  They have no right to impose on the non-Muslim, to make them feel welcome, they're here, they should make themselves as amenable to Europe as possible.  It's like if I went around wearing the Hari Krishna saffron robe... I'd be laughed at, my friends would cringe and ultimately ostracise me."

But these women are odd ones out. They're immigrants in a western society. Don't you think they're entirely conscious of how most people treat them? Their husbands and fathers impose this desert God bullshit on them, with such intensity and for so long, that they internalize the reasons for covering up. They've been conditioned to want their own repression, and the icing on the cake is that 99% of society treats them like some kind of untouchable. How many cashiers engage them in small talk at the counter? How many passersby smile at them when they pass on the street? So much of their experience is saturated with a sensation of being the 'other', whether as a woman in Islam or an immigrant in the west.   Turning them into the butt of a joke, like OP - I understand where it comes from. But my inner bleeding heart leftist commie librul hates it. It's mocking the oppressed. If you want change, you don't attack the oppressed, you attack their oppressors."""

It's the typical elite Liberal outlet. A mixture of Communist scum, PoC racists to bait the public and one or two proper journalists kept within very narrow parameters so that their association brings the paper prestige but their investigative work never strays into the paper's politics.  Basically The Guardian is there to make Muslims and black people angry and resentful, by partial and biased reporting on issues domestic and global. Then to provide the least intelligent members of those groups with a platform from which to bark at the society they live within, to complain and agitate and aggravate people, whilst The Guardian's mods delete all opposition and complaints on the site.  The upshot is of course, that racial and ""minority"" tensions are raised, a conspiratorial silence is observed over criminality (Rotherham, Rochdale, Dewsbury ...), the general public are misinformed and maligned and those who become aware of the truth are enraged and provoked.

As women, we are supposed to completely hide our bodies under a tent of cloth, so as to reduce any sexual temptations. (God forbid a man sees the outline of your thigh...) And yet, you don't see any men covering up to do the same. So essentially, Islam is telling us that we have to cover up because men aren't responsible for learning how to avoid temptation and exert self control. Therefore, they have control over us. And unfortunately, it stays that way, because from a young age, Muslim girls are fed this ideology and they think it is okay, because that is all they know."

Arabs and Persians contributed, Islam itself did sod all and, more importantly, the most fundamental contributions were the transfer of Hindu ideas and knowledge in Mathematics to The West, something that would have happened even earlier, had the Islamic empire not existed.  Don't forget, it's because of the Islamic blockade/control over the route to ""India"" and China, that Britain, Netherlands, Portugal and France went sailing around the world, looking for India (and naming any lands they found after it).  Best case scenario, ""India"" would have transmitted Mathematical, scientific, philosophical and historical knowledge to Europe without the conditions of colonial subjugation. Whilst also continuing its own development, interspersed with occasional unions between kingdoms and expansions and contractions of local empires.  We'd probably have no naval empires at all, as the money in Venice and London would be poured into land routes and (perhaps) trains and other vehicles, for the purposes of transport over long distances.

The main problem I believed arised from the Islamic reform movement in mid-late 20th century. Islam was beginning to die out, the Arab world was becoming more liberal than it is today.

I mean I know they used to try and tell me that ""Islam gave women rights"", but given that Khadija was basically Mo's sugar-mummy, I find that rather difficult to believe.  Also, what would your sources be for making such a claim? I wasn't aware that there existed an independent body of historical data for the period, that would be of sufficient quality to extract information about pre-Islamic and Middle Eastern society during the period of Islam's birth and initial development.  Broadly speaking, I see no specific Islamic ""social justice"" with respect to slavery, war, rape, government. In fact Islam normalised and gave divine authority to oppression of minorities, both in terms of open pogroms against non-Muslims and in terms of the jizya that applied to minorities that wished to stay within regions conquered by Islam."
exmuslim,3cwkte,MohammedRidesAgain,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:14:46 2015 UTC,"Well for one, I think it's a well known historical fact that Arabs used to consistently kill female infants, for fear of losing ""honour"" if she ever gets does something ""inappropriate"". I won't claim Islam ""freed"" women in any way, it's still derogatory and sexist, but it was still a step forward, giving rights like choosing who you get to marry etc. when at the time Arab tribes would marry of girls just for creating links with other groups they found favorable. Slavery wasn't abolished by Islam, once again proving that it is outdated, but it was made very favorable to free slaves. Islam ""relatively"" didn't crush minorities. The jizya, once again relative to the time period was much better than becoming a social pariah, getting assaulted and executed for your different beliefs, which I'm pretty sure was common all over the world in the 7th century.  As for sources, to be honest I won't claim to have legitimate ones, but I assumed all this was common knowledge to anyone who is, or in our case, was Muslim? I know they're used as arguments to justify Islam (which they aren't since they are good relative to the time). Just because Islam is false doesn't mean all the history surrounding it is.   You can go ahead and ask r/askhistorians to make sure? Tell me if you come up with anything against my statements I'd be interested to know and expand my knowledge."
exmuslim,3cwkte,impious-salt,3,Sat Jul 11 23:59:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure there's much there, to be honest. It's just broad assumptions that are pretty much the go-to assertions of Muslims and Islamists.  1) Khadija chose her husband, was a very rich woman and lived an independent life prior to Mohammed's nonsense.  2) Aisha didn't choose her husband, was given to Mohammed and had no way to give informed consent.  So that sort of leaves me puzzled as to how Islam ""gave"" anything at all, that wasn't already present within the wider culture.  If there is some documented evidence of a culture of infant sacrifice/infanticide, then fair enough, otherwise my default stance is to assume this is simply Muslim propaganda.  Marriage was (and in the upper echelons remains) about strategic alliances and securing familial wealth. That actually doesn't make it a bad thing. Especially given how fickle ""love"" can be (Western divorce rates?).  So again, I don't see this as a situation that Islam improved upon, since internally it practised marriage for the sake of alliances as well as the property-style distribution of daughters (Aisha).  Jizya wasn't an improvement on anything, it was merely a tax on the weak and subject populations. Outside of revenge, I doubt many empires wilfully exterminated subject peoples, do you have any evidence of such practices?  I mean, the Romans only flung the Jews out of Palestine after several rebellions and they extracted tribute from all their conquered territories, which is pretty much what Jizya is.  I'm pretty sure that part of what makes Islam false is its hagiography, the ideas and notions that it has about itself that, when contrasted with objective/impartial records (where available), just don't ring true.  The history surrounding Islam - not the academic research, which neither of us obviously are up to speed on - that we know, is just the mythology that flows from its believers. It basically is ""Islam"".  I wouldn't read the Bible as a historical document nor would I take ""Islamic history"" as anything but an equivalent to Biblical history."

The US still spends crazy amounts on basic science research.  [1] Garmin is basically a combination of two US fedaral government projects, USGS maps, and GPS satellite system. The US is unusual in government in that works of the government are not copyrighted, which is why NASA images are everywhere and so popular, and having open map data was huge for the development of mapping software (without giving credit, and then Google once it is established continues the lock-down of UK map data, for which OpenStreetMap got its beginnings)."

That said, I was banned from /r/islam for support gay marriage. (sorry can't link to comment because I deleted it--it quoted Plato's Republic ""Not long ago, as we shall remind them, the Hellenes were of the opinion, which is still generally received among the barbarians, that the sight of a naked man was ridiculous and improper; and when first the Cretans and then the Lacedaemonians introduced the custom, the wits of that day might equally have ridiculed the innovation.

exmuslim,3cvc8y,kingmoriarty,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:11:23 2015 UTC,"Islam brings drama everywhere it goes, and ""new atheism"" is nothing different. To illustrate my point, from Wikipedia introduction:   Long describing himself as a socialist and a Marxist, Hitchens began his break from the established political left after what he called the ""tepid reaction"" of the Western left to the controversy over The Satanic Verses, followed by the left's embrace of Bill Clinton, and the ""anti-war"" movement's opposition to intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Even though Hitchens did not leave his position writing for The Nation until post-9/11, stating that he felt the magazine had arrived at a position ""that John Ashcroft is a greater menace than Osama bin Laden.""[8] The September 11 attacks ""exhilarated"" him, bringing into focus ""a battle between everything I love and everything I hate,"" and strengthening his embrace of an interventionist foreign policy which challenged ""fascism with an Islamic face"".[9] His numerous editorials in support of the Iraq War caused some to label him a neoconservative, although Hitchens insisted he was not ""a conservative of any kind"", and his friend Ian McEwan described him as representing the anti-totalitarian left.[10] Hitchens recalls in his memoir having been ""invited by Bernard-Henri Levy to write an essay on political reconsiderations for his magazine La Regle du Jeu. I gave it the partly ironic title: 'Can One Be a Neoconservative?' Impatient with this, some copy editor put it on the cover as 'How I Became a Neoconservative.' Perhaps this was an instance of the Cartesian principle as opposed to the English empiricist one: it was decided that I evidently was what I apparently only thought.""[11] Indeed, in a 2010 BBC interview, he stated that he was ""still a Marxist"".[12]   Note:   His numerous editorials in support of the Iraq War   This guy is a religious fanatic."

exmuslim,3cw3qm,Vallentain,4,Sat Jul 11 15:20:34 2015 UTC,"Sweden records all alleged rape as rape because it turns out that the fake rape report rate is miniscule. It records each INSTANCE of rape as a separate rape.   So if you were raped by one guy 3 times then it would count as 3 different rapes. Each act counts as an individual. The rationale is that this is a more effective method of treating rape as a crime because it logs in the actual count and severity of the problem. While in most other places the accusation requires things like evidence and a will to prosecute to be logged in.   Oh and Sweden's rape law is gender neutral. If you were raped by a woman you can report it too and it would add to the statistics.   The rationale is rapes can occur that you cannot prosecuted simply because (and this is pretty sane BTW) you cannot legally prove a rape occurred. You are innocent until proven guilty and if you can provide reasonable doubt you can walk. In Sweden they are a bit more honest about this than in other places.   And Sweden has the highest rape report rate. As in rapes that do occur are more likely to be reported in Sweden. By the logic of this piece, Pakistan is super safe for women as the total rape reports are miniscule. Just 10,000 rape reports in Pakistan... A year. Yet 72% of women report rape... How can this be?   Because official report rates require certain metrics to be met in order to be logged in. While a direct report is just the number of women who experience sex where they are coerced, threatened or felt like they could not refuse without negative consequences."

You started an account 12 days ago and EVERY SINGLE POST you've made is in r/exmuslim. You don't want us to know who you are so you can post here against us with immunity. This is the definition of cowardice. Many people on this forum make secondary accounts (myself included) because they want privacy to deal with their problems. You do it to antagonize them. If Islam is so blatantly truthful you don't have to skulk around here like some asshole spy.  Let me go through just the posts in which I've interacted in you:  Your reply to this post in which you just ignored EVERY point I made and then tried to misrepresent Islam when NONE of that crap you posted is in the Quran (the opposite in fact, in that it says Men are a degree above women and that you can hit them). I see that you've deleted your post because everyone called you out on this. Lol.   So he was a great actor now, as well as master of the egyptian language, a brilliant poet (good enough that his people called the Qur'an 'magic'), someone who knows how to correct the errors historical errors in the old testament too.   Can you demonstrate that Muhammad needed to be a master of the Egyptian language to produce the Quran? So what if people called the Quran 'magic', this is a dishonest argument. Barely anyone who isn't a Muslim thinks the Quran is even good. And this historical error thing is a LIE. The Quran actually copies directly many of the errors from the Old Testament. For instance   It claims the Earth was created in six days Claims that Allah taught David how to make mail coats when mail coats didn't exist till 1000 years after (And David did not likely exist)   In addition it makes FURTHER historical errors that the OT didn't make.   Denies the Crucifixion of Jesus which is actually the only historic fact we know about him Implies that Moses is Jesus's uncle by confusing Mary with Miriam and calling her the sister of Aaron and son of Imran/Amram Speaks of Alexander the Great as a Muslim when it is recorded history that he was an idol worshiper and actually claimed to be the son of the God Amun Fucks up big time when it says that Ishmael was the son that was to be sacrificed when it was actually Isaac in the OT    And just so, ""Response to Ibn Warraq"":   You post this crappy response to Warraq. Someone calls you out that it is a bad source and addresses none of his major objections and you ignore him. In general in this thread, you just ignore legitimate objections and power through with your misinformation.  .  I don't have to go through the rest of your posts. Anyone can go through your post history and see what you're about. Go Dawah somewhere else to more gullible people. No sensible person who actually studies the evidence of Islam objectively could ever reach the conclusion that it's divine. That's why people like you suppress information about it."
exmuslim,3cvmym,AbduallahDaInfidel,2,Sat Jul 11 03:49:59 2015 UTC,"For me far more convincing proof that people around Mo saw through his bullshit is from Abu Talib. He took care of Mo from a young age. and Mo is reported to have gone in to super sad mode when Abu Talib died. However, based on most evidence, Abu Talib never converted to Islam. I remember when I was young, we were told the story of the 10th year of Mo's prophethood when he lost Khadija and Abu Talib within a month of each other and was super sad. During those lectures, I remember the professor saying that there is some doubt as to whether Abu Talib said shahadah or not, however, most historical accounts point to the fact that Abu Talib died a pagan. And I was super sad because I felt that he never benefited from the bounty of ima'an (I was a Muslim then). Now I think about it and wonder if Abu Talib thought of MO as an immature kid with some new notions that were not worth accepting for himself!"
exmuslim,3cvmym,itistemp,2,Sat Jul 11 11:59:19 2015 UTC,"I would like to ask a question about ‘aqeedah. Is it part of our ‘aqeedah to believe that the Prophets committed sins and were not infallible?.  Firstly: With regard to the first issue, the Prophets were infallible in conveying the message from Allaah. They did not conceal anything that Allaah had revealed to them, and they did not add anything from themselves. Allaah said to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning):   “O Messenger (Muhammad)! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. Allaah will protect you from mankind” [al-Maa'idah 5:67]   http://islamqa.info/en/42216  I know Surah Masad was revealed because of Abu Lahab rejection. but Muhammed could not provide a direct sign from allah to prove his prophecy. We know Muslims believe that Prophet Muhammed is somewhat Infallible in this regards of giving dawah to the people. So did Muhammed commit a mistake, thus making him a FALLIBLE human being not some kind of divine person sent by god."

From my perspective as an skeptic, it's clear Muhammed got someone to write that because of his clear opposition to his prophecy. It sounds odd to me that allah would address one specific person as ''he'', who opposed Muhammed claim to prophecy, there were many Arab Pagan tribes who didnt believe in Muhammed and went to War with him, Why didn't allah address them all together as ''they'' in this specific verse as opposed to ''he''"
exmuslim,3cvmym,razmatronix,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:24:46 2015 UTC,"Abu Lahab was absolutely horrible. He was by far a horrible man out of them all. This Surah was revealed to him, so I don't see why it should have to reference all of them, this prophecy does not necessarily apply to all of them, some of their children may of stayed as pagans unlike Abu Lahab's. And to exclude that would make it not that much of a prophecy, if it just talks about hell really."
exmuslim,3cuoho,captaindisguise,22,Fri Jul 10 22:40:29 2015 UTC,"I'm really not enjoying this whole ""Hijab gives me control"" narrative. That women have to cover and men don't (and women cover for the benefit of men) is a second rate mental tap-dance.   I agree that the Western media and advertising objectifies women to ridiculous heights. However, a woman wearing jeans and a jacket is not objectification. Not being allowed to even show your hair, besides being impractical, really says something about the way women are viewed. Hair isn't just a part of your face, it's now a sex object that turns men on. Meh..."
exmuslim,3cuoho,CadmeusCain,11,Fri Jul 10 23:13:42 2015 UTC,"it's also bringing in ridiculous fetishes of a by gone era right. Maybe hair was fetishized at that time (some cultures love arm pits btw, some people love feet). We are living with one group of people or possibly one man's person fetish.  I see zero things good about the Islamic mandate for hijab, it is literally designed to protect women from men and men from women. There are zero liberating things about it, for either gender. I've seen men try to check out the butts of women in full burka or grab them in the markets, on the other hand you can watch un molested on nude beach in Europe."
exmuslim,3cuoho,IHateTheLaw666,6,Fri Jul 10 23:40:51 2015 UTC,"I agree entirely. I also feel like it sexualizes women at a VERY young age. Already from 9-12 they're subliminally told: ""you are different from boys. They want your body"". If you've actually been to a co-ed school where boys and girls interact (I wasn't) and are not separated you find that men and women get along just fine and while dating does happen, they don't see girls as ""other"" or as a separate species. I was at a boys' school and had no sisters, so up until college I saw girls as ""other"" and different to me. It was only when I got to college and started interacting with them that I started to see them as just other people. I had never once tried to grope anyone; they were equal in respect as my guy friends. Now at work I have so many women in my team and I treat them with the same respect as anyone else. I don't ogle their butts or cum in my pants when I see their hair.   Seriously, it's so offensive to be told that we need to be kept away from seeing women for our own moral safety (and that women need to cover for vice versa)."

Eventually I managed to get out of it by suddenly claiming I had somewhere to go after Esha and running away. I'm sure they saw something suspicious. Nearly got caught!"

exmuslim,3cucdy,ontrack,4,Fri Jul 10 22:49:22 2015 UTC,I can kind of relate to this! I have a big family and after iftar I'm the one who has to lead the prayer because as a child I was the one who memorized the surahs in the Quran and what have you.  I know maybe 6 or so of them and I'm constantly nagged that I should attempt to recite the longer ones that I know. Except I completely forgot the longer ones and stick to the short ones.

exmuslim,3cu7n1,CadmeusCain,2,Fri Jul 10 21:14:48 2015 UTC,"Well start off by telling us a little bit more about your situation. What kind of family do you live in? Are you out about your atheism? What's your current financial situation? Are you in school? Do you have plans to study? Who knows about your atheism? How strict are your family.   Maybe read some of the coming out posts on this forum for the kind of information that people provide. I'd love to help where I can, but I don't want to give you advice that's irrelevant to your situation and does more harm than good."
exmuslim,3cu7n1,CadmeusCain,4,Fri Jul 10 21:37:38 2015 UTC,"Ok my family is not strict they let me go places and stuff and they are close to me and loving and take care of me but, I can't live with their religious values for the rest of my life and be unhappy and at age 25 or so the are going to tell me to look for Muslim women to be engaged with and marry. I have 2 brothers in college and a sister who is engaged and who are all Muslims, expect my brother who is in middle school not sure what his views are. I am currently going to be in my sophomore year and looking to finish high school but I'm not sure about college yet I would like to be independent without it if I can. The only people that know about my atheism are the people that saw this post. My dad works and my mom doesn't. My family is doing financially good. I only have $500 and currently unemployed. My cousins are close to me too and they are Muslims too but they won't help me out if I told them why I left Islam."
exmuslim,3cu7n1,CadmeusCain,2,Fri Jul 10 23:09:26 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to sound unsympathetic but you would be taking a huge risk to come out or leave home at 16 with no education, no job and no money. I am in the second year of living on my own and it's not that easy. It takes maturity and savvy. If you decide to leave home or your parents find out and kick you out, you could be screwed. I know this might be tough to hear but I don't want you to make a mistake you can't reverse.  25 is a long time away. Trust me, at 16 the rest of your life is still a long way and a hell of a lot can and will change in the next 5 years. Try and focus on your studies. If you can do well at school, you might be able to go to college. If your parents will put you up in one, or you can get a scholarship or bursary, there's your ticket out. If you can study something that'll get you a decent job you can become financially independent very early in life and move away from your parents. Right now you can't do that without taking huge risks.  For now try and make some non Muslim friends who you can really trust. Maybe you have some at school? They'll help you cope and give you a support structure. Try and join groups that'll help you feel like you belong.   You said your parents are loving and not strict. You're very lucky compared to many of us on this forum? What is it in particular that you're struggling to live with? Maybe we can help you deal with some of those things."
exmuslim,3cu7n1,Twiceadopted,2,Fri Jul 10 23:24:57 2015 UTC,Could I still manage without colleg even if the job is not that good because I think I'll do better in the future as in entrepreneur.
exmuslim,3cu7n1,wankersFC,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:59:56 2015 UTC,"As the other guy who replied to you said, it is possible but it's very difficult. If you really believe you'll do better as an entrepreneur and that's what you want then go for it. But know in advance that's a financially risky life and that you need to be prepared with a Plan B if it doesn't materialize the way you expect. If you don't want to go to College, that's also fine, but then realize that it will be more difficult to get yourself a job that allows you to be self-sufficient. You'll have to start at the bottom and work your way up. This is ok if you're willing to do that.  You sound like you'd benefit from financial education in general. Maybe check out some financial SubReddits. I also recommend Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki and The Richest Man in Babylon by George Clason. They're SUPER basic, but they'll give you an intro. If you're serious about entrepreneurship then you should read about it as much as you can and ask advice so that you have the best chance of success. I think a parallel discipline that would also benefit you is also investing and financial management in general.  Pretty much: if you want to achieve your goals in life, be prepared to work hard for them.  Also, something else that Twiceadopted below said is valuable: you don't want to cut ties with your family just yet. I'm in my second year of living alone and even though I'm financially self-sufficient there have been times where I've been in trouble with something (e.g. nearly got screwed by a rental contract, many things breaking etc.) and the only people I could run to for support and advice was my parents. You don't have to believe the same things as your parents (I sure as hell don't) but you will need them from time to time, especially in the early years until you can really become more mature, worldwise and financially settled. It will help you to leave home on good terms and to remain on good terms with them."
exmuslim,3cu7n1,neveralone2,0,Sat Jul 11 09:30:57 2015 UTC,"Muslim here, probably not someone you want advice from but I feel that I can provide some much needed clarity.(no offense)   From you posts it's seems like your fam isn't out to get you or stifle you in ways that you find unbearable. Yet, unbearable are your feelings towards living with them. you behavior and feelings are normal for a teenager. Regardless of religion, kids in their teens so feel like having more freedom and a great many of them can't wait to get out asap and experience life with out any accountability to family and parents. It sucks and I've been there. You have no game plan, you haven't networked enough to know about life and how to go about living it on your own. How to manage money and budget. What to do when money is tight. Who to lean on when you are lonesome and get sick. You're feeling more or less what vast majority of teens feel.   I would advise you to build on your education and spend time with your family. Once you move out, you'd miss them immensely. Get your high school done and experience your high school years. There is no sense in working your butt of and worrying about money at this age. Hold a weekend job and experience that. Learn things about yourself. Learn your own spending habits so you can make adjustments in time before adult life and it's burdens become very real.   You want to be an entrepreneur but even that costs money and you ain't raising serious dough working a minimum wage job. If you can pay your rent on minimum wage that's a big enough accomplishment in itself.   You are young, you haven't experienced college yet. You haven't experienced multitasking and meeting deadlines the way it happens in college. You haven't explored all the different people on different paths you meet in college. With out college, it isn't that one can't be successful, it's that the vast majority of people do not become successful. Grand dreams are great, now just work on putting in the time. You are less likely to be approved for business loans with out a degree.   Make plans for your self, your very first task is to ensure that you don't end up becoming slave to a job, with no money to spare on your ambitions. So if a career doesn't concern you, because your own goals do not align with a career path, then choose the career that makes you money. At least if your ambitions of being a business owner fail you'll have a back up that'll allow you to bounce back on.   You the sum of people you meet and what you learn from them, with out college you're limited to meeting people who only visit your cashier or whatever other minimum wage job you have. College allows you to widen your networking amongst a seriously diverse group of people.   Let's not forget, if you move out now, you greatly limit your own standing with your family. Were you to not make it in the real world, how embarrassing would it be to come back home. How much would your family see you as an adult and take your seriously.   Unless your fam is abusive you don't need to do a cut and run. Family is awesome to lean on when times are tough. But have to put your dues in too.   I read this advice somewhere and it resonated with me.   You are a teen, you are extremely ambitious but your fam sees you as a child. What to do.?   Get involved with everything in the house. It will only help you. Sit down with your parents and understand how the house hold is run. Take an  interest in the family affairs. Take an interest in the kitchen. Wash those dishes, make your bed, try to accompany your parents to grocery shopping and pay attention to how they shop, what things they buy. Keep an eye on things that are needed in the house. Cut grass, was cars, always do your own laundry. This helps you come into habits that you'd later have to develop when you're on your own. It'll help with time management and the biggest benefit is, your parents will see you as an adult, when time comes to move out, they'll miss you but they won't think of you as a child getting ready to make a huge mistake.   a good way to measure your progress with the fam is, how much your mother is yelling at you. If you're coming home past your curfew, if your mom's doing your laundry, if she has to do dishes after every meal, if she had to clean your room. You are no where near ready.   To get a better understanding on your position. Ask yourself if you know how much an average 1 bedroom apt is, how much monthly expenses are. Let's say, rent in $1000. Insurances, car, TV, Internet, phone, social activities, water, gas,  electricity , gym, groceries is about 1500-2000.   You need 2500-3000 dollars to just live. Now look for a job with out any experience that even comes close to paying this much. Forget savings, and education, you won't be able to survive on your own for very long.   Keep these things in mind before making the decision to move.   Obligatory: try to explore your parents religion even more. Your akhirah is in your hands and I hope you are guided to the path that brings you closer to Allah(swt)."

But these women are odd ones out. They're immigrants in a western society. Don't you think they're entirely conscious of how most people treat them? Their husbands and fathers impose this desert God bullshit on them, with such intensity and for so long, that they internalize the reasons for covering up. They've been conditioned to want their own repression, and the icing on the cake is that 99% of society treats them like some kind of untouchable. How many cashiers engage them in small talk at the counter? How many passersby smile at them when they pass on the street? So much of their experience is saturated with a sensation of being the 'other', whether as a woman in Islam or an immigrant in the west.

You see women in miniskirts and free-mixing between the sexes in malls all the time. You can't be too intimate in public though (i.e. kissing), and insulting the government is a big no-no, so there are a few problems here. Generally you can freely buy alcohol and pork and no one seems to care if you're Muslim or not, unless you publicly admit your apostasy."

Its really difficult to be an exmuslim in this community as its a very close knit community with a high level tablighi influence and 28+ mosques within a 202 km radius and the adhan blares loudly for all 5 daily prayers, youd think you in a middle eastern country . Its not very easy to be a exmuslim , people who often leave the faith are sort of ostracised by the community and my family would probably find out soon if I come out.   In other parts of Johannesburg where there are larger populations of non-muslims it wouldn't be a problem living as a exmuslim as South Africa is largely diverse when it comes to religious issues."

As of the 2001 census which was the last census that counted peoples religious views Muslims made up about 1,5% of the population, Christians were about 80% and people not affiliated with religion were about 15%.  Although at university most non-muslims that are my friends don't affiliate themselves with any religion and irreligiousness seems to be a growing trend in South Africa."

Interesting place to be Muslim (or ExMuslim) - Western Province and Central Province Muslims tend to be rather irreligious (my grandfather's family had a Christmas tree and Santa Claus when they were young!). Eastern Province Muslims are much more religious and mosques are popping up everywhere. In fact in the capital, you'll find a significant number of Muslims in nightclubs, bars, event organising companies, even in the local music scene. A lot of Muslims are superficially religious - but no one will publicly announce their apostasy as gossip spreads around fast (I guess that's a SE Asian thing, not exclusive to Muslims).  Unfortunately some folks going to South African/Pakistani religious schools are becoming religiously educated coming back and doing dawah work. And you've got youtube lecturers from the likes of Mufti Ismail Menk, Nouman Ali Khan etc., so things are getting a bit stricter. Some of my family members have started wearing abaya and a minority even the face veil. My cousin who was once a major metal head now does nothing but forward Islam lectures on our whatsapp family group!   TL;DR: Sri Lankan exmoose here, life is pretty chilled out as people in general follow religion only superficially (but no one can publicly will say they're atheist due to a ""what will the neighbours say"" kind of attitude). Some external influences are causing religiousness to rise."

The situation is similar here in Indonesia, especially when you live in one of the bigger cities. This is the reason why I'm thinking to ""convert"" to Christianity in name only though, since announcing apostasy is a big no here (and you can't leave your religion field blank on your ID), ""converting"" to one that I find less restrictive seems like good idea at the moment. Many of my extended family members are Christians as well, so I don't think I will face much objection."

If your reports or journals have 20 different meanings and you consistently cling to unfounded claims by saying it's a metaphor without a way to discern it from literal meanings...  You are a failure.  But we can't say that to Allah.   The circular logic goes back to say that Allah can't be wrong."

In your example the scientist is presenting 20 faulty claims as evidence and holding fast to this even though other members might have offered cold hard facts against it.   What I am referring to is a scientist taking a measurement of some kind, let's say the weight of a sample of an element. You will not deny the element exists if you get a weight that differs from 10 others who also weighed the same sample.  You will blame your measuring techniques, maybe check the calibration of the scale ect.  It is your fault (or perhaps the machines) not the actual samples."

In your example the scientist is presenting 20 faulty claims as evidence and holding fast to this even though other members might have offered cold hard facts against it.    That's the problem really. Cold hard facts are easy to check and point out. Scientific instructions are not supposed to be ambiguous. If I was following a clear set of instructions, it is easy to see the mistake. If the instructions aren't clear and can be randomly metaphor..  What is cold hard facts in religion?   God won't say anything directly so you guess and guess and guess...   Then some people interpret something literally and you get mad, saying that clearly God was saying it in metaphor. Geez."

Anyway, what you perceive to be a cold hard fact of religion is vastly different than what any believer will, i.e. that the Qur'an is speech of God, thereby making everything in it true via. God's properties of omniscience.  So discussing that will be fruitless.  Remember, religious claims cannot be empirically measured.  But the analogy still holds weight.  If you have a clear set of instructions, I can still make an error.  Suppose I didn't reset the scale after the measurements, suppose there was a few specs of dirt on the scale to alter the reading...the list can go on.  At the end of it all, I recognize my mistake, I do not claim the fault lies with the element (i.e. saying the element changed it's weight while I was trying to measure it).  This is what Muslims say:  blame me and my insufficient knowledge, do not blame the core of the subject, Islam itself."

How do you know to discern fake from truth?   But the analogy still holds weight.  If you have a clear set of instructions, I can still make an error.     Of course, but it is easy to prove me wrong when you have cold hard facts. Science is written clearly.   This is what Muslims say:  blame me and my insufficient knowledge, do not blame the core of the subject, Islam itself.   Yes but then what is true islam? Where can we see it? If they claim others are misinterpreting then what is the criteria of intrepeting it clearly? No ambiguous or hidden meanings or surprise metaphors.  The thing is, they put the cart before the horse. First, claim Islam is true then work every argument to prove that Quran is correct 100%. That's circular logic."

On the other hand, I'm going to say that I don't think it's a bad idea in principle if it makes people give charity who wouldn't give charity otherwise. Really. It should be clear to you by now that we don't live in a world full of empathetic loving people who wants whats best for the next person. Most people care only about their own local group, usually just their family and community and won't lift a finger to help another group (it's linked to our evolutionary tribal ethics).   If this kind of lame preaching can get people to donate to those who need it, then I'm for it. I don't think those orphan kids in Afghanistan give a crap whether or not that money was given 'with a good heart'. It's the same as when celebrities give charity to get more publicity.

It's pretty pathetic that people consider someone like this to be a moral authority. Most people are like this sadly. I think the smart thing to do is then to channel peoples' greed and self-interest into societal benefit (like Capitalism and Celebrity charities have done).  But hey, I guess that's one of the reasons why you and I are no longer Muslim right?

exmuslim,3cuup4,captaindisguise,5,Fri Jul 10 23:30:37 2015 UTC,"Spinoza shows it's possible to believe in ""God"" without being religious and follow stupid man-made rituals. He assumed that ""everything which exists"" is ""God"". This is called pantheism. Albert Einstein believed in the same ""God"" as Spinoza.   Unlike abrahamic faiths, pantheism doesn't spread filthy lies about God wanting to control your lifestyle, judging you, getting rage fits, torturing unbelievers, etc. The pantheist God is not an individual/person and has no human characteristics, like the abrahamic God. You and every atom are a part of it, so it's present everywhere. But it never does divine interventions (like causing earth quakes when angry). It neither needs your worship/belief, nor wants to make you behave in a certain way. It will not punish you for anything, only the laws of cause and effect matter. It also doesn't desire to take 20% of the war booty, like Allah. It simply has no needs and wants, and it has no emotions. Only (autonomous) egos do. Saying God has emotions like anger is like saying ""the sun is angry"".  As Allah is seperate from creation, the pantheist God is bigger than Allah. Because there is no seperation between ""creator"" and ""creation"". So Allah is ""God"" minus ""creation"", while the pantheist God includes creation, which makes it bigger. Basically the visible universe is the outpouring of the divine soul. Giordano Bruno is the ""martyr"" of pantheism, he got killed by evil catholics for publicly mentioning his belief."

exmuslim,3ct6fg,CadmeusCain,10,Fri Jul 10 18:31:06 2015 UTC,"It's actually very possible. If you haven't read the Quran already, you should read it, and then do some research on the contradictions and problems in it. It's very repetitive and it's 600 pages it goes through the same stories several times: the stories of Abraham, of Lot, of Moses, of Jesus and of Ad and Thamud. All of these were well-known myths at the time.  The rest of the Quran may be impressive in poetic form, but remember also that the Arabs had a long culture and history of poetry. They had annual poetry competitions (of which Umar was a judge) and many poets made a living by writing poems (often insulting ones to enemies) in return for a fee. That Muhammad could have produced poetry in a highly poetic culture should come as no shock to anyone. Some of the greatest poetry from any language comes from that region. See Al-Mutanabbi for instance.  As with regards to the contents of the Quran: it really contains no useful or special information. What factual information it does contain is mostly incorrect (See here, here, here, here and here). A lot of the moral teachings are taken from elsewhere, and much of the rhetoric is easily produced by a human being. There is nothing content-wise that is particularly astonishing. Morally, the Quran is actually behind other teachings (but ahead for Arabia). Read the New Testament and see how far ahead of the Quran Jesus's teachings are. I'm currently reading the Analects of Confucius which predates the Quran by 1000 years and the moral pronouncements are far more benevolent and kind.  In fact, there are some clear mistakes in the Quran that shed a lot of light on Muhammad's methods. For instance, the Quran recounts some stories of Jesus which we know come from Apocryphal Gospels (such as the Infancy Gospel of Thomas). What must have happened was that Muhammad heard these stories, could not tell which was fraudulent and which was not, and then just included them in. In one particularly shocking case, he confused Mary, the mother of Jesus with Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron. He calls Mary, the daughter of 'Imran' (Moses and Aaron's father is Amram, which is the Hebrew version of the name) and then calls Mary the 'Sister of Aaron'. See here   So yeah, entirely possible that Muhammad could have come up with it. Much of is just redacted information from other sources. There are few original teachings or stories if any.  EDIT: For some background on the historical context of the Quran, I recommend No God But God by Reza Aslan and Muhammad by Karen Armstrong. The first is written by a Muslim and the second by a pluralist Christian. Neither of them is anti-Islam and should shed some light on the circumstances. For hardcore investigations, other people have recommended Ibn Warraq. I'm reading his book at the moment."

exmuslim,3ct6fg,TheNaah,10,Fri Jul 10 21:20:59 2015 UTC,"I see that you are asking a lot of questions about Islam and where it comes from so I'd like to point out some things that I think are worth researching.  Islam is mainly built on three sources of historical documents:   The Quran The Hadith: collections of oral narrations passed down and then later recorded. The Sunni Canon consists of six books with Bukhari and Muslim considered the most reliable The Biographies of the Prophet, the earliest of which were written 100-200 years after the fact by Ibn Ishaq and Al-Tabari    If you want to learn about Islam, you should spend some time learning about the Hadith. What they are, where they come from, how they compiled them, who compiled them, how they decided what was authentic and what modern scholars have had to say about this. The earliest written collection is Bukhari's which comes 200 years after Muhammad's time and was compiled in response to the thousands of fabricated Hadith circulating at the time. As for the biographies, many of them were commissioned by the Caliphate and they too are built on oral narrations; in essence they are redacted Hadith.  Since most Islamic doctrine is built off the Hadith, studying them will tell you a lot about Islam. The Quran is not very descriptive and cannot be used to build a religious orthodoxy. For instance: it tells one to make Salaah, but now how to do so. It tells one to fast but the rules about etc."

The way they are given is always changed.  Then he says that the stories were well known, yeah of course, this is why the Jews specifically asked ""Tell us about the story of Joseph (as) and his brothers.."" as a trick question because they thought the arabs did not know it.  Then he goes on to say that the Prophet (peace be upon him) could have learnt poetry, doesn't make sense though since he was never known to even go into any of these competions and is in fact noted to be someone who specifcally wasn't good at poetry.   Then him saying that the Qur'an is not useful, posting things that have been reffuted numerous times.  Then he says the moral teachings were taken from elswhere, say of course, eveyrone around arabia was soo yes to not racism, etc. Why do you think the Prophet (peace be upon him) had so many enemies, cos he went againts those morals. He says behind, even though 50 years ago there was still balck and white seperation in America.  Then he says that there are clear mistakes, my ass these have been reffuted plenty of times. Anyone who actually reads the Qur'an knows that Moses's sister is clearly different from Mary (peace be upon her), why? Because she was alive before the Jews even went out of Egypt?! If Jesus (peace be upon him) was born of a young women it makes absolutly no sense for Mary (may God be please with her) to have her before the Exodus even occurs. The Prophet (peace be upon him) even responded to this, he argues that 'Imran is an issue, which it really is not.. Why? Reason being that 'Imran was an arabic name before the Arabs even knew about Moses (peace be upon him) and his parents.,  Also he was talking about the apocraphyl gospels, even though anyone who reads the two accounts in them can see how differnt they are..  Ccompare the story about Jesus (peace be upon him) speaking in the cradle where it says in the Infancy Gospel:   ""... Jesus spake when he was in the cradle, and said to his mother: ""Mary, I am Jesus the Son of God, the Word, which thou didst bring forth according to the declaration of the angel Gabriel, and My Father hath sent me for the salvation of the world.""   While in the Qur'an it states:  Surah 19:28-34   ""O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother a harlot. Then she pointed to him. They said: How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle? He said: ""I am indeed a servant of Allah. He has given me the Book and has made me a prophet. And has made me blessed wheresoever I may be, and has enjoined upon me prayer and almsgiving so long as I remain alive, And (has made me) dutiful toward her who bore me, and hath not made me arrogant, unblest. Peace on me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive! Such was Jesus, son of Mary: (this is) a statement of the truth concerning which they doubt.

But you have to remember that divine inspirstion could have taken place. I.e. Muhammad (saw) was inspired by stories he heard from the Jews. This doesn't dispute his claim of revelation. After all the Bible was divinely inspired.   You also have to take into account historical sources that state Muhammad (saw) was known for his noble character, which implies he wouldn't (at first) deliberately deceive a mass of people, particularly because he was persecuted by the Quraish for denouncing idolatry.  Later on could he have made things up to suit his needs?  Perhaps that might be the case, related to hadiths where Aisha (ra) commented on the quickness of revelations."

However, that doesn't necessarily mean that no part of the revelations had personal benefit to him.  The mention of the various things that were exclusive to the Prophet (saw) are interesting to look at for example.  Yes, the nature of a prophet is to be special amongst your people, and as such, might offer some benefits to you, but you have to look at it from another perspective: after dealing with hardship and strife for so many years (a result of the actual revelations) what's to say that Muhammad (saw) didn't realize the position he was in and sought to take advantage in some way.  These are the things that I question.

I do not have an exact number nor do I know how they determined the authenticity of that persons account (this is something to ask an actual Islamic scholar) but I will say this:  as much as I have my doubts and questions on something, it would be dishonest of me to say that all x number of accounts were false/can't be relied upon.  I don't think it does anyone any good to say all of this is a grand conspiracy to make Muhammad (saw) look like the noblest of human beings.    And just to address the last part of your statement, while it's true that I wouldn't necessarily tell the bad moments and character traits of my best friend (although it is tempting!) due to not wanting to smear their name or simply forgetting myself, we can't say the same for every single person who gave testimony of Muhammad (saw).

It would be foolish to go to me asking a question about you: I have no clue who you are or what you are like.  I am not qualified to give my opinion on you.    As such, with Muhammad (saw) we can only go to the people who actually had contact with him and knew of his character.  All of the accounts of his character were not only done by his friends and family.     This is just for being skeptical of hadiths narrated by sahaba or aisha.   it would be dishonest of me to say that all x number of accounts were false/can't be relied upon.   I don't think all of them are false, and I don't think Mo was purely evil either. But, like every other humans he has his flaws.   I don't think it does anyone any good to say all of this is a grand conspiracy to make Muhammad (saw) look like the noblest of human beings.     I won't call it conspiracy, it is nothing more than allegiance and loyalty towards your lord/masterl. Let's look at political parties now. Do you think republican supporter will say anything bad about their leader?   we can't say the same for every single person who gave testimony of Muhammad (saw).  I say this because those people would also have to have a record of good character and not lie.    Usually people with good characters don't talk bad about their friends behind their back. It isn't about lying.   not everyone could be wrong.    They're probably not all wrong, though some might be.   Also I do not know (if anyone knows, feel free to chime in) but there were also Quraishi's and other enemies who were opposed to the idea of one God existing who still defended the character of Muhammad (saw) himself.     Yes, but the people who reported these stories are still muslims.  Just an example. I hate adhan with passion, and I think that it is unethical to have such a loud noise at 5 in the morning. Not everybody is muslim and I deserve my rights to sleep/privacy.  So I complained about adhan, which many muslim lurkers read here.  Their responses? Adhan is a form of art and nonmuslims here (in their country) like it anyway, it makes them feel spiritual. Theyre not lying, I bet some nonmus friends they have might like adhan (though even if they dislike it they might not tell him) BUT they completely disregarded my experience. As if my complains never existed.  If they tell potential converts about Islam.. would they tell about my complains? No? All humans are biased like this, and religious faith makes it even more so.  So we have some poets here and there who wrote something bad about Mo. Some of them actually got killed. Mus source says it is their fault for attacking first, but we cant hear the reasons of the other side of the coin... The annihilated side. Did they really attack? What is their story?  How would we ever know?  If everybody seems to trust and like Mo, how come Mo had to have SO MANY defensive wars in the first place? Why did so many people dislike him?  History really is written by the victors. It isnt just Islamic history, it is also Christian, Buddhist and other culture history. If you ask the mongols about Gengis Khan they will you that he's a hero (my dad admires him wtf). Are they all lying? Do they all have bad characters? I know for certain that my dad have upstanding morals, but hey bias."

You don't even know your own children. You don't even know yourself what you would do in certain situations. Embarrassing example, recently a friend was cleaning my new second hand BBQ. I had a brand new full 10 kg gas bottle. He accidentally set fire to the gas bottle hose. In my mind, I would be the hero, ring for the fire brigade, put my bare hand into the fire to turn the gas bottle off and ensure my friend was safe. Reality; I took off like a startled gazelle, took the phone with me and called the fire brigade, while screaming from a distance for my friend to join me. No one can EVER know what is anyone else's true intentions, feelings and thoughts. It's not humanly possible,"
exmuslim,3ct6fg,AnAbdullah,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:53:48 2015 UTC,"The fact that the Bible is edited does not prove nor reject the claim that this person, Paul, received some sort of revelation a la Muhammad (saw).   Please tell me how one 'proves' that someone has a revelation. All we can really do is take Paul's or Muhammad's word for it. Which is funny because if both of them received a revelation that God told them contradictory things. To Paul he says: ""Jesus is my son"" and to Muhammad he says: ""I have no sons"". Is God trolling?   If you're going to say Hitler was a great guy according to testimony from other Nazi's, then we might as well say no one's character can be definitely proven because it's all subjective and depends on who you ask   It is very subjective when this thing happened 1400 years ago and only Muhammad's buddies can testify for him. But what you say isn't even true. We actually have record in the Hadith that Muhammad approved of telling lies under certain circumstances. Does this prove he told lies himself? No it doesn't, but he clearly approves of lying when it suits his goals. He blatantly allows lying to have someone murdered, to reconcile a marriage and in battle. Read the last Hadith in particular. Don't blame me for not trusting him.  Bukhari 3:69:369   Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:  Allah's Apostle said, ""Who is willing to kill Ka'b bin Al-Ashraf who has hurt Allah and His Apostle?"" Thereupon Muhammad bin Maslama got up saying, ""O Allah's Apostle! Would you like that I kill him?"" The Prophet said, ""Yes,"" Muhammad bin Maslama said, ""Then allow me to say a (false) thing (i.e. to deceive Kab). ""The Prophet said, ""You may say it.""...   Bukhari 3:49:857   Narrated Um Kulthum bint Uqba:  That she heard Allah's Apostle saying, ""He who makes peace between the people by inventing good information or saying good things, is not a liar.""   Muslim 32:603   Humaid b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf reported that his mother Umm Kulthum daughter of 'Uqba b. Abu Mu'ait, and she was one amongst the first emigrants who pledged allegiance to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him), as saying that she heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: A liar is not one who tries to bring reconciliation amongst people and speaks good (in order to avert dispute), or he conveys good. Ibn Shihab said he did not hear that exemption was granted in anything what the people speak as lie but in three cases: in battle, for bringing reconciliation amongst persons and the narration of the words of the husband to his wife, and the narration of the words of a wife to her husband (in a twisted form in order to bring reconciliation between them)."
exmuslim,3ct6fg,AnAbdullah,2,Sat Jul 11 02:20:42 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the believer.  If you're Christian, you will obviously refute the validity of any messenger coming after Jesus, because there would be no reason for another messenger to be revealed if Jesus died for the sins of all humanity.  On the other end, if you're Muslim and believe the Bible and Torah were changed, then it's not hard to then believe someone else received the message.  We have nothing but the testimonies of others to prove this.  Hence why faith will always play a big role in any religious belief.   I never said that Muhammad (saw) was proven to have never told a lie or advocated people to lie.  If you look at all of these hadiths you gave, the reasons are valid for someone to actually lie.  They're  not lying for lying's sake.  I do not remember much, I would have to look it up, but didn't Ka'b bin Al-Ashraf commit treason against the Muslims?

exmuslim,3ct6fg,TheNaah,3,Sat Jul 11 06:40:58 2015 UTC,"It's possible that the Koran is a compilation of various religious liturgy and political folklore, that was popular in Arabia, written as an accessory to the Torah or Gospels for Muhammad's Arab supremacism.

This political manifesto was turned into a evangelical religion in the 9th century when the original Arab supremacism was outgrown by the Arab empire."

exmuslim,3ct6fg,TheNaah,2,Fri Jul 10 21:08:04 2015 UTC,Woof. I've been reading about Islamic scripture and history for a while now so this is personal theory that combines what I know. The Islam that is practiced today is most likely a creation of Abd Al-Malik's reign. Tom Holland's Shadow of the Sword is an excellent description of this.  One thing I'm certain of its that the Koran is not an excellent piece of literature. It is a mediocre but haphazard collection of extant materials. The first clue is that it is written using the poor grammar of an unsophisticated but literate person. The second clue is the range of existing stories found in the Koran have been tracked to other sources.  This gets complicated so it'll be complicated approaching each topic separately.

He went through a lot. And whenever he needs to vent or solve a problem or for whatever reason he sees fit, he would make up more verses. It built up through time. As for the jewish/christian content, think of it like fan-fiction. He loved the lore, and built on it.

exmuslim,3ct6fg,Vallentain,-2,Sat Jul 11 07:44:26 2015 UTC,"Here is a list of non-Muslims, preaching the sincerity of the Prophet (peace be upon him):  J.W.H. Stobart said:   Abu Bakr was a man of the purest character. His friendship for Mahomet, and unwavering belief in his mission, are a strong testimony to the sincerity of the prophet. (J.W.H. Stobart, Islam and its Founder, page 209)   Tor Andrae said:   The genuineness and sincerity of Mohammed's piety, and the honesty of his belief in his religious call, are indisputable. (Tor Andrae, Mohammed: The Man and his Faith, page 185)   John Gilchrist said:   We can safely reject the view that Muhammad was a deliberate impostor. Throughout the twenty-three year period of his assumed ministry, he held to the unflinching conviction that he was called to be a prophet and that the revelations he was receiving were coming to him from above. (John Gilchrist, Muhammad and The Religion of Islam, Chapter: A Study of Muhammad's Personality: An Assessment of His Personality)   Arthur Glyn Leonard said:   If ever a man on this earth found God, if ever a man devoted his life to God's service with a good and great motive, it is certain that the Prophet of Arabia (Muhammad) is the man. Muhammad was not only the greatest but truest man that humanity has ever produced. (Arthur Glyn Leonard, Islam, her moral and spiritual value: A Rational and Psychological Study, pages 18-19)   W. Montgomery Watt states:   His readiness to undergo persecutions for his beliefs, the high moral character of the men who believed in him and looked up to him as leader, and the greatness of his ultimate achievement - all argue his fundamental integrity.  To suppose Muhammad an impostor raises more problems than it solves.  Moreover, none of the great figures of history is so poorly appreciated in the West as Muhammad. (W.

A LOT of the violence in the Quran is also attributed to the fact that Islam during Muhammad's time is completely different from what Islam is today. During Muhammad's time Islam was a religion + nation + an international community. Violence was waged in order to protect the nation and the wider community.   I think Shias have different hadiths to Sunnis I think but I don't know much about that. - Yes they do have different but throughout history shias have borrowed reasonable and I'm sure unreasonable hadiths from Sunnis and even SALAFIS!  - Depending on where your from different hadiths have been crossed over for certain nations. For example when my dad first caught me drinking, I got a lecture. He told me that if you drink your prayers won't be accepted for 40 days. At the time this brought me further away from Islam, i was fairly popular in high school and there was really no other way for me to spend my weekends. When I went back to learn about Islam I found out that this was not mentioned in the Quran at all. Furthermore it wasn't mentioned in any shia hadith either! I eventually found the origin of this hadith in a either Salafi or Wahabi text, Idr which one it was. Among the pakistani shia community in NY everyone accepted this hadith as accurate and even more so, quranic! At many points in my life I realized I can't trust other people for anything. - Furthermore as I've mentioned throughout this thread, Shia's regard that many hadiths are fabricated, so if your reading hadith you have to assess whether it makes sense or not. A lot of hadiths don't make sense and a lot of them are bereft of context.

IMO You ALWAYS have to look from as many perspective as possible and in the absence of other side of story we musn't make a hasty conclusion.  ESPECIALLY statistics and wordings that can be skewed and played around.   More and more of what I read I realized that religion is not that bad and I eventually accepted Shia Islam.    IMO Your version of Islam that is OK with doubting the existence of God isn't so bad, I agree.  However the mainstream Islam... hmm that's quite bad."

Granted I'm not perfect and I'm sure there is much more to learn out there.  IMO Your version of Islam that is OK with doubting the existence of God isn't so bad, I agree. - Through my readings I learned that it WAS accepted to have doubt. Without doubt there is no true faith. If you pray 5x times a day because you are scarred of god's wrath, well then your just a pussy. I don't pray 5x a day, but i pray regularly. When I do pray I reflect on my life and all the good that I do have. I ask for forgiveness and thanks. It helps to set me at ease and for me to just be thankful. If there is a god I want to thank him to not have me born in Pakistan.   However the mainstream Islam... hmm that's quite bad. - There are so many things that I do that are not in the realm of mainstream Islam because IMO mainstream Islam is bloated with so many non islamic things, that are not good for well anyone.  -I agree mainstream Islam has gotten bad throughout the world, but in America Islam has done quite well. The big Islamic scholars here preach many progressive values and none are against Islam, more so they represent Islam and what Islam used to be before lord knows what happened. A lot of the bad you see today is deeply rooted in misunderstandings, politics, the old cultures of some countries and that culture's influence on Islam, amongst other things. When I initially ran away from Islam I saw many things that were associated with Arab and Desi culture that had stained the religion of Islam. For example, I went to a Sunni islamic school in Pakistan when I was a kid. The teacher knew I was an american and he told me to learn english was haram and all this other B.S. He said that English was the language of the non-believers. Well Einstein didn't realize that by that logic Persians who ruled the sub continent spoke Farsi (Language of Zorostrians), and that he spoke Urdu (Language of the Hindus mixed with Farsi), that he originally spoke Pashto (Language of the buddhists). What he didn't understand was that Islam and many religions were made flexible because it had to survive all over the world through different times. That is why Islam has been found from Arabia to Europe to Africa to China and beyond.  - Furthermore a lot of the bad is more rooted in poverty and other social issues. In places like America, Islam has flourished so well because American Muslims are generally better educated, even compared to non muslims, wealthier, and live a higher standard of living. Comparatively most American Muslims lead better lives than their European counterparts. In places like England Pakistani's are among the poorest of all groups in England. With Poverty come all social problems that get embedded into the European/Muslim mindset. The same case is seen in France  with Algerian muslims and in other European countries.  - Another thing is that many Muslims don't understand ""Western culture"". They see people that look different, dress different, with a different religion. They have all these pre conceived notions which are largely untrue.  - Everything has to be interpreted for the time and situation you're living in. One big problem that I see today is that Muslims rely on Hadiths that were written hundreds of years ago and hundreds of years after the prophet's death. Those hadiths were written in the context of those societies and the trials and tribulations of those people. They can be used as a guide but they can't ultimately resonate with what kids are going through today.  I could ramble on and I notice myself digressing a lot but what I'm trying to say what you see around you and what you hear on a mimbar is not always Islam."

By its own definition faith is blind belief in God,  - When I studied Shia Islam one of the most striking things I read was that it might not be true. Throughout much of shia philosophy it is said that you have to continously ask questions and question the status quo, even if that means you question faith. These themes throughout Shia history is ONE of the reasons why Shias are so hated. It is also a reason why so many religions and sects were born out of shiaism such as Bahais, Bohras, Ismailis, Druze.  IMO mainstream Islam is bloated with so many non islamic things, that are not good for well anyone. No offense but most people who is a little bit experienced will know how to differentiate this, it isn't that hard really just look at the scripture. - Many times modern scholars and academics have seperated scripture from culture and they have seperated scripture from politics as well.

It is not fear mongering to protect your land from mass immigrants who REFUSE to assimilate and would choose sharia over their laws. Not to mention that any place with devout muslim majority is highly uncomfortable for anyone else to live in. I cant wait to get out of this shithole.  I dont approve of their treatments of mass immigrants, at the same time a country have rights to refuse immigrants from creating illegal settlements however they want. Arab countries can deny citizenships, why can't they?   Furthermore there are many ethnic and religious conflicts throughout the world right now and none of them have anything to do with religion itself but what religion can represent.    I dont deny this, but ethnic tension is much easier to remove. One or two generations usually most people will already assimilate and be happy.

The earliest place where I've seen any negative mentions of dogs is in Sahih Bukhari. Sahih Bukhari is NOT the Quran. It is a collection of hadiths made by a guy named Bukhari. It is one of the biggest collections of hadith and is only used by Sunnis and Zaidis. I'm neither so I have rejected this. Furthermore the Quran lauds dogs in Surah of the cave. That is the only mention of the dog in the Quran. Throughout Arab history there has always been a stigma against dogs and that has crossed over into islamic culture. Conversely cats have always been prized, especially in Egypt because they would eat the rats that would eat crops.  After I leave my parents home I'm going to get a dog. You can read more in this article. http://www.scholarofthehouse.org/dinistrandna.html  Dude, I know this is probably new world and new information to you, but I CAN differentiate cultural and religious influences.  - I've been seperating the two throughout this thread and using empirical evidence to support many of my claims.   I'm sorry but I mostly know sunni because I live in Indonesia, BUT if you reject sunni hadith... (I actually like that) you're basically rejecting the canon of the faith. So many practices are from hadiths you might as well as make a new religion. - Everything outside of Quranic practices I do not do. The Quran only asks you to do a few things such as pray, charity, hajj, etc.  - I don't think I'm  starting a new religion but I am shying away from the practices of man, especially those practices that are harmful and make no sense.   No offense, but I do know the basics of Islam. To accuse someone here to not know anything (and apparently you are an authority in this?) in this sub is basically cray. I read a lot about this stuff too, you're not the only one who can read. - I don't think I;ve said that you or anyone knows anything, what I'm saying is that there are tons of misconceptions, misunderstandings, politics, etc that have shaped modern practices of Islam. These are often exploited by both those that hate Islam and those that claim to be the scholars of Islam. - Furthermore everything bad that a Muslim or a muslim country does is interpreted to speak for Islam as a whole, at any level this is ridiculous. There are many insane laws that are present in muslim countries and they are presented as if they have any islamic basis when in reality they really don't.   As for the hindustva and myanmar... I'm sorry but I'm with them that muslims need to know their place. In a caliphate, nonmuslims will be below muslims and they are never afraid to show it. - (Speaking from a shia prespective )There hasn't been a true caliphate since the death of Imam Ali. After his death even many Sunnis agree that Hasan was rightfully next to take the throne but Muawiyah had usurped power instead. Since then even the direct progeny of Muhammad were massacred and persecuted. Does this speak of Islam, those that practice it, or the rulers in power of that time? When Karbala happened many of Yazid's soldiers did not know that they were fighting the grandson of their prophet. And when people found out many did switch sides and they were among the dead.  - Especially in Shia Islam NO MAN can lead a Calpihate, why? Because like I've said throughout this thread ALL MAN are considered to be fallible. Ever since Imam Ali's death the 12 Imams have not been in power. Instead people like Muawiya and the Ummayads were in power. Just like how Saudi Arabia uses their clerics to justify their actions, the Ummayads did the same, to the extent that they had the entire Muslim community at war with the Grandsons of Muhammad.  - Every ""Caliph"" since after Ali had only nominally a caliph. Even more so, there were many caliphs throughout history and they were often at war with each other!  - Even in Sunni Islam,  they say that there won't be another true caliph until the Mahdi returns. - In conlcusion to this what I'm trying to say is that there is NO CALIPHATE AND THERE IS NO CALIPH. All it is is barbarians trying to justify their rule.   As for the hindustva and myanmar... I'm sorry but I'm with them that muslims need to know their place. - There is so much hate in this one line that I cringed.  - First of all IT IS NEVER ALRIGHT TO BE KILLING PEOPLE. - Secondly the leaders of these movements have very little do to with buddhism or hinduism despite the fact that many of the leaders are clerics. This is strictly about hate, poverty and power. These problems are existent because of the rampant poverty of these countries which leads to the absence of law and order. - Everyone needs to know their place and that's under a rule of common and civil law. Before you say anything about Muslim countries not having civil laws or ""Sharia laws"", these are BIG POLITICAL problems not Islamic ones.  - How can you justify hating Islam bc its violent and then going on to say that it's alright for others to do the same with muslims? If your belief is that you're atheist because religion is violent and atheist's are morally superior than you are the biggest reason for why your wrong. Just because you are religious/atheist doesn't mean your a moral person.  (1)It is not fear mongering to protect your land from mass immigrants who REFUSE to assimilate and would choose sharia over their laws. (2) Not to mention that any place with devout muslim majority is highly uncomfortable for anyone else to live in. I cant wait to get out of this shithole. (1) This is a complete political issue that you've thrown into this argument. What I assume you are doing is assuming that I'm some ultra far left liberal, which I'm not. I'm an American REPUBLICAN, and I'm on the Eboard of my schools College Republicans.  - Firstly i completely support Europe not allowing ILLEGAL immigrants, and I completely support the same being done with ILLEGAL immigrants from hispanic countries in the U.S.  -  Secondly, I also DO acknowledge that the majority of the reason that people are against immigration reform is because of racism, not all but A LOT has to do with racism, this is the same case EVERYWHERE, in muslim, european, american countries. Prejudice and racism against minorities, ESPECIALLY immigrants is an extremely basic tenant of sociology. - Third to say all these people want is sharia is another blatant lie. Do some want? yes. Should those people be allowed to stay? Absolutely not. But to say that even a majority want sharia based laws is not true at all. Think about Fox New's  Muslim only zone reports and the backlash fox faced after making these statements. Furthermore those that DO want ""Sharia"" laws are the bottom rung of society and are EXTREMELY allienated as well as extreme minorities. BUT they are most certainly the VOCAL minority and the media loves anything that fits their mold. These types of people are practically expected to be inclined to such things. If it wasn't for Islam they would be involved in crimes and gangs, not to say that many probably already aren't already involved. If you have read anything about Psychology or sociology you would know that these are pretty basic things across all borders. - Now Once again As I mentioned I'm trying to stick to Islamic issues, not everything that has to do with MUSLIMS. Muslim issues and Islamic issues are both different things.  I dont approve of their treatments of mass immigrants, at the same time a country have rights to refuse immigrants from creating illegal settlements however they want. Arab countries can deny citizenships, why can't they? - I'm only going to entertain non Islamic posts for this current post so I'll finish off on this. - I completely agree they CAN and SHOULD turn back ILLEGAL immigrants. BUT the problem here is that Europe has ALWAYS portrayed itself as morally superior to not just the Muslim Middle East but everywhere else that isn't Europe. This issue goes far deeper than just illegal immigrants.   Not to mention that any place with devout muslim majority is highly uncomfortable for anyone else to live in. I cant wait to get out of this shithole. - This is a complete bullshit generalization. I doubt that you have traveled extensively enough to have seen Muslim communities throughout the world. I've been throughout Pakistan, UAE, and the US. You know what sucks POVERTY. If your living in a poor or underdeveloped country, There are obviously going to be many problems. In the US Muslim neighborhoods are FAR better off than non - muslim neighborhoods. Are there Muslim hoods? Of course but it's not the persons race or religion that define whether a neighborhood is good or not. Low powered miniorites in the US include African americans and hispanics. Their neighborhoods are STEREOTYPICALLY supposed to be the worse, but if you either live or just look at statistics it's pretty easy to tell that race or religion is the sole criteria for whether a neighborhood is good or not. - Again when your saying muslim neighborhoods are bad and what not, just refer to Fox's Muslim no go zones. =)"

exmuslim,3cs267,noodlewith0butter,6,Fri Jul 10 09:35:56 2015 UTC,Something I've noticed is how Muslims justify these teachings by citing now Allah created women different (read:inferior) to men in some way.  Obedience and beatings: God made men the maintainers of women and he made women the ones to have babies.  So all women should obey their husband because he has to care for her and he should punish her so she doesn't get out of control.  Women lack good skills of judgement and reason.  They are too emotional.  Talaq:  God gave women menses and made women very weak and emotional so they can't be trusted with talaq.  Hijab:  Men find women's bodies very sexy and appealing.  They are driven to lust by an uncovered woman.  Women should hide the feminine outline of their body so not to arouse men to rape or harass them.  Testimony: God gave women poor memory and forgetfulness.  I like how Allah is specifically designing women to be inferior to men and then finding new ways to discriminate against them.  Subhanallah!

Whilst the rest of the world has progressed in terms of women's rights, Islam has refused to move forward and frankly, it's all misogynistic bullshit. Every rule, every hadith, every ayah about women is about how they aren't as good as men. Their witness statements are worth half as much, they're only entitled to half as much inheritance, they are deemed to be less intelligent, they are accused of being more sinful.

Someone just going thru the motions. I felt like that at her age, but fast forward 10yrs later, I questioned my behavior and beliefs and completely made the break in my mind. For many of us, Muslim/Arab practices become part of our cultural identity and even when we leave we still identify with Islam. I envy her conviction of her muslimness in her short shorts and piercings cause she has the 'freedom to grow up into a person'- key word FREEDOM-  is a luxury thousands of non-western Muslim females will never get to experience."

I'm not a Westerner by the way. I don't live in 'the West'.  Also this is different. Free speech applies UNILATERALLY TO EVERYONE. EVERYONE HAS THE SAME FREE SPEECH RIGHTS be they a man, woman, black, white, straight, gay, albino, autistic, whatever. In Islam a man has MORE rights than a woman does. To list a few:   Men can hit their wives, women can't hit their husbands A man's Awrah is navel till knees. A woman's awrah is her entire body. Men can take multiple wives and have sex with female slaves. Women cannot have multiple husbands and cannot have sex with male slaves Men don't need their wives' permission to marry additional wives (Muhammad certainly didn't need his wives' permission. Aisha was often against it) A man's witness is worth twice a woman's witness A man's inheritance is twice a Woman's inheritance It says in the Quran that men are a degree above woman   So it's not the same as Western rights, which give the same status to all people equally.

The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to him, ""Please, man, give me that straw to build me a house."" Which the man did, and the little pig built a house with it.  Presently came along a wolf, and knocked at the door, and said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in.""  To which the pig answered, ""No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.""  The wolf then answered to that, ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and ate up the little pig.  The second little pig met a man with a bundle of furze [sticks], and said, ""Please, man, give me that furze to build a house."" Which the man did, and the pig built his house.  Then along came the wolf, and said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in.""  ""No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.""  ""Then I'll puff, and I'll huff, and I'll blow your house in."" So he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and at last he blew the house down, and he ate up the little pig.  The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks, and said, ""Please, man, give me those bricks to build a house with."" So the man gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them.  So the wolf came, as he did to the other little pigs, and said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in.""  ""No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.""  ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.""  Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and huffed; but he could not get the house down. When he found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said, ""Little pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnips.""  ""Where?"" said the little pig.  ""Oh, in Mr. Smith's home field, and if you will be ready tomorrow morning I will call for you, and we will go together and get some for dinner.""  ""Very well,"" said the little pig, ""I will be ready. What time do you mean to go?""  ""Oh, at six o'clock.""  Well, the little pig got up at five, and got the turnips before the wolf came (which he did about six) and who said, ""Little pig, are you ready?""  The little pig said, ""Ready! I have been and come back again, and got a nice potful for dinner.""  The wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be up to the little pig somehow or other, so he said, ""Little pig, I know where there is a nice apple tree.""  ""Where?"" said the pig.  ""Down at Merry Garden,"" replied the wolf, ""and if you will not deceive me I will come for you, at five o'clock tomorrow and get some apples.""  Well, the little pig bustled up the next morning at four o'clock, and went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came; but he had further to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was coming down from it, he saw the wolf coming, which, as you may suppose, frightened him very much.  When the wolf came up he said, ""Little pig, what! Are you here before me? Are they nice apples?""  ""Yes, very,"" said the little pig. ""I will throw you down one."" And he threw it so far, that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the little pig jumped down and ran home.  The next day the wolf came again, and said to the little pig, ""Little pig, there is a fair at Shanklin this afternoon. Will you go?""  ""Oh yes,"" said the pig, ""I will go. What time shall you be ready?""  ""At three,"" said the wolf. So the little pig went off before the time as usual, and got to the fair, and bought a butter churn, which he was going home with, when he saw the wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and by so doing turned it around, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened the wolf so much, that he ran home without going to the fair. He went to the pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him.  Then the little pig said, ""Ha, I frightened you, then. I had been to the fair and bought a butter churn, and when I saw you, I got into it, and rolled down the hill.""  Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he would eat up the little pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him. When the little pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down, took off the cover, and in fell the wolf; so the little pig put on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate him for supper, and lived happily ever afterwards."

exmuslim,3cq9y2,nicotron,7,Thu Jul 9 22:56:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly that. They say: ""How did Joseph Smith come up with over 100 semitic names?""  The answer is 'quite easily'. In the case of Jo we have more information than Mo because it was more recent. Most of the names he made up were recombinations old ones (Moses + Josiah = Mosiah) or were stolen off maps (Moroni is a place's name). Also: any decent fiction writer could have done this in an afternoon.   What's really funny is that we know Jo was stealing verses from the King James Bible because when similar verses appear in the Book of Mormon theu retain the translation errors in the KJV!

One time my dad surprised me by popping out of nowhere and I had remnants of potato chips floating around in my mouth I didn't realize of and he's like ""ARE YOU EATING?!"". I panic, and I'm like ""Nooooo"" and he just walks off. That night at iftar he's his usual bubbly self so I'm like, man, I must have been convincing with my use of the word ""no"".   I was obviously wrong. I did get a couple of lectures on atheism later that month, but nothing serious. Brown parent lectures demand you just nod and have an earnest face until they are over and then you run off and do whatever the fuck you were doing beforehand.   During the lecture, my dad gave me the example of his uncle, who was the only openly atheist person in our family (a couple others are closeted). This uncle of his grew up in the relatively liberal beginnings of Pakistan in the 50s and 60s where there was a growing communism and leftist ideology among the youth. As a side note, a lot of the Muslim world was heading towards secular nationalism - the Ba'ath party around this same time in Syria and Iraq also had similar political aspirations. But I digress... Anyways, my dad told me how this uncle of his was a ""drunk"" and ""financially unstable""... and how his brother, who was Muslim, was a millionaire businessman - and his thesis was that this is representative of the atheist experience LOL - ""God is kind to the Muslim man, while shitting on the atheist man"" - obviously I could have torn that argument to shreds but for obvious reasons that's not a good idea.   Instead, I just nodded here and there while I thought to myself that this motherfucker had one job - to show people that atheists are perfectly capable, upstanding citizens of society and they do just as much a service to society as religious folk, minus all the judgmental hatred and bullshit - and he fucked that up for me.. And his brother had one job, to not show him up and he also did exactly that.    Anyways, I had the pleasure of eventually meeting the man. He's just a really simple guy who likes to get his drink on and he doesn't give a shit about materialistic things like money and whatnot. I think it has something to do with the hippie culture he grew up in.   Anyways, that's my long, pointless story about eating in Ramadan."
exmuslim,3cokmj,hugga4u,3,Thu Jul 9 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not a muslim, never was, but sometimes I like to check in this sub. Anyways, if you take a step back and think about these moral values: work, money, family..  Really, they're a bit slave-like don't you think?  Why do I need to make a lot of money and  have kids? For the greater economy?  What your uncle is doing can only be viewed as ""bad"" from a conservative religious standpoint.  In reality, there are no rules in life. The only thing we know is that we're born, we live, and we die. The only meaningful rule I can extract from our existence is: life is short so enjoy it.  Imagine you're a kid, and your parents take you to a ballpen or an arcade, and they say ""Ok, we've paid for 1 hour of fun, make the most out of it."" - you could spend that 1 hour enjoying yourself in the best way you can, and if you had empathy, you'll realize that everyone else has only 1 hour, so you''ll try to get out of their way and let them do whatever they want, as long as they let you do whatever you want, so that everyone can enjoy themselves.  Your uncle has this mindset, and for him and many others, drinking is his largest pleasure, and he only has 1 hour (1 life) to enjoy it, so he may as well live it up! Pleasures are a good thing if you know how to indulge in them responsibility so you're not harming others or detracting from their 1 hour (1 life) of fun."

The fragments were rejoined by Abd Allah ibn Zubayr using a silver ligament  Under Abū-Tāhir Al-Jannābī (ruled 923–944), the Qarmaṭians came close to raiding Baghdad in 927, and sacked Mecca and Medina in 930. In their attack on Islam's holiest sites, the Qarmatians desecrated the Zamzam Well with corpses of Hajj pilgrims and took the Black Stone from Mecca to Al-Hasa. Holding the Black Stone to ransom they forced the Abbasids to pay a huge sum for its return in 952.  ... Its abduction and removal caused further damage, breaking the stone into seven pieces. Its abductor, Abu Tahir, is said to have met a terrible fate; according to Qutb al-Din, ""the filthy Abu Tahir was afflicted with a gangrenous sore, his flesh was eaten away by worms, and he died a most terrible death."""

exmuslim,3cro04,seafair,2,Fri Jul 10 09:58:36 2015 UTC,"The biggest one is embryology. Check out this video and this highly comprehensive document, thoroughly ripping apart the embryology argument.  Here's a video regarding the ""miracle"" of the honey bee  Here's a video by a muslim debunking the claim that the Quran talks about the shape of the earth.  Also, check out the 'Quran Miracles Debunked' series by TheIslammiracle (sorry, I don't think there is one playlist for all 50 videos)....some of the videos have a lot of dislikes, ignore that. Once you watch the videos with a objective mindset, you realise that those are likely butthurt Muslims doing what butthurt muslims who can't defend Islam often do: attempt to discredit, drown out and/or silence the critic....even if you do not agree with some of the videos, please don't take that as an indication that every video is therefore false....if nothing else, it will get you thinking about it (something Muslims are strongly encouraged not to do) and start the process to further research.  And always remember out of all the ""scientific"" claims made in the Quran, we need only prove one as false. Since all the claims are so fantastically obscure that we cannot be sure about them, if we can show even one claim to be blatantly false (which is the case, in my opinion, with the embryology claim), we know that the Quran (and therefore Islam) is false....the entire construct of Islam very quickly crumbles, as it so often does when a person sits down and thinks about it objectively."
exmuslim,3cro04,godlessdivinity,0,Fri Jul 10 06:10:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks I'll definitely take a look at the paper. However from a quick glance at the video, I will say this: disputing Hamza's claim is not the end all be all of the argument. It's merely that: putting a stop to the claims of one scientist who wants to extrapolate more evidence than is there. Also he refers to a Hadith however I am not sure if it's shaih or not.   And with the honeybee example, the guy is disproving a guy known for his instabale mental state lol. He is originally Turkish lecturer who is known for extremist ties, so anything he writes I take with a grain of salt. However the speaker did mention something about why things were mentioned in the female plural, but in Arabic inanimate objects in a group are always mentioned in the feminine while living groups are mentioned by specific gender according to what they contain."
exmuslim,3cro04,godlessdivinity,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:05:15 2015 UTC,"disputing Hamza's claim is not the end all be all of the argument.   Hamza is irrelevant. Replace Hamza with anyone and it would not change the argument set forth by the video and the document. Hamza just happened to be the voice for this argument. Many muslims still believe it. The point of the article and the video is to show the flaws in the claim. As we are often told by muslims, I would ask you to read the document and give the video more than ""a quick glance.""   Also he refers to a Hadith however I am not sure if it's shaih or not.    Most hadiths that are talked about in the document are sahih.   And with the honeybee example, the guy is disproving a guy known for his instabale mental state lol   Again, Yahya is irrelevant. The argument does not change even if someone else was making these claims.   This is where objectivity comes into play. If you are honest with yourself and actually want to look at the evidence, you would pay more attention to the evidence and less at irrelevant details like who is making the claims. For example, I would not focus on Newton's interest in alchemy and the fact that he was a religious man when I want to look at his claims about gravity. I will focus on the evidence."

exmuslim,3cro04,CadmeusCain,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:53:50 2015 UTC,"Take your time. No one's telling you to read it right now, there is no deadline.  Refuting something as silly as ""the Quran gives accurate details about embryology"" is a straight forward and simple exercise. All one needs is a high school level understanding of human reproduction and an objective mind when studying the Quran translation of the relevant verses, read the relevant tafsirs and from there, the relevant hadiths. But in the endevour to make Islam compatible with science, muslim apologetics (like yourself) take part in the most remarkable mental gymnastics, forever changing the goal post and never accepting any interpretation that allows a person to arrive at a conclusion other than the one that makes Islam compatible with science. They will accept everything and anything to make it so, attack people personally, focus on their credentials, focus on the speck of black paint that may be a mistake amidst an entire white wall of overwhelming evidence that forms the critics' argument; and even happily throw their fellow muslims under the bus (figuratively speaking) so long as Islam's integrity is untarnished and remains free of criticism. In other words, the fault lies with the reader and his understanding, never the book or the religion.  To do this, they distort the words of the Quran beyond recognisation and happily ignore every other thing that shows that the claims in the Quran are not scientifically accurate and take shelter in the bastion of obscurity, a tactic that successfully fools the more naive portion of the population. For example, you chose to focus on irrelevant details and ignore the video made by a muslim that shows the scientific claim that the earth is spherical to be false. I can also tell that you will ignore the crucial point that any claims made in the Quran that are shown to be scientifically inaccurate will necessarily prove the Quran got something wrong and hence, destroy (no hyperbole here) Islam in the eyes of all except the devout; because the devout can simply dismiss it all as metaphorical language and focus on the spiritual aspects of Islam. But that is all irrelevant when you try to mess with science....don't fuck with science because science will fuck you up....many muslim apologetics (and indeed, apologetics of other religions as well) have grown wise to this fact and are careful to avoid making such stupid claims except when referring to the origins of the universe, one of the few gaps in human knowledge that religious apologetics are more than happy to fill with God...and not just any god, but their particular flavour of god, which is where the ""leap of faith"" comes in, i suppose. But that is unacceptable if you want to bring science into the debate, the apologetic will simply end up making him/herself look like a fool."
exmuslim,3cro04,wooowman93,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:06:57 2015 UTC,"Two things:   I am not a Muslim apologist.  I am just someone looking for clarification on many things, not someone harvesting arguments against Islam and rebutting them.   I never clicked the link you're referring to, so please do not assume I'm ignoring things out of convenience.   As for what you say about mental gymnastics, I agree with you on that.  When someone's faith and livelihood is on the line, they will resort to any means necessary in order to protect their beliefs.  I have nothing to say about the link about the earth being egg shaped.  Unfortunately, I am not the most knowledgeable in Arabic grammar, so I won't comment on that part, but I am unsure why people would postulate an idea like this.  Even if you take the verses the Qur'an has on the earth being like a carpet and others referring to a flat-like shape, those don't actually say the earth, in it's true form, is flat.  So why some Muslims will go out on a limb and proclaim the Qur'an says the earth is spherical is beyond me.   My issue with many of the claims within the Qur'an (and the people crusading against them) is that the Qur'an was never meant to be interpreted as a book of science.  I liken it to when people learn a new word.  Suddenly you start hearing the word more often.  Similarly, when someone learns something in university or through independent research, you notice things you didn't before, including references to it and assert your knowledge on a book that was never intended for that subject. Granted you have your Yahya's who hire teams of dedicated scientists looking for anything they can, but on average this is not the case.  (And the reason I mentioned his credibility in my previous post is because I do not like to entertain people who are known to be staunch defenders of any ideology.  I prefer to look people who are objective as possible when dealing with matters such as this).  My point is, these scientific facts are inputted via. the interpretation of others.  If you want to say this is the classic ""well it's our human error and not the Qur'an that is to blame"" then I guess it is.  When you prescribe scientific claims on a book that is not meant for that, problem obviously will arise.  It's not necessarily  (not all anyway) believers basking under the banner of obscurity and catch-all solution of misinterpretation.  It's that these issues are legitimate in many cases because like it or not, many people have a score to settle or point to prove and will do anything they can (like the devout Muslims/Christians/Jews) to get that point across.  This includes being academically dishonest and fabricating hadiths or mistranslating verses in the Qur'an.  This is why I thank you for the article on embryology, because out of all of the claims, this one is pretty straightforward in the Qur'an.  And as an aside, faith is not merely present in the belief that God created the universe, but in many other facets of the religion.  An example would be the buraq that made its ascent to heaven.  Obviously we know such a creature doesn't exist here on earth and no fossil evidence exists for any creature like it, however, if one believes in God, then it is not hard to imagine their existing such a creature.  Hence, faith is critical and can solve lots of contradictions and issues people have and to validate these miracles, which by their definition are (yet) unexplained phenomenon."

exmuslim,3cqros,oneofthegoodassholes,7,Fri Jul 10 00:50:36 2015 UTC,"Islam is Judaism for stupid people, I really believe that's all it is.  Initially Arabs probably felt left out, Jews having all sorts of weird and wonderful, intricate dietary laws and laws making everything more complicated. It felt like God really was interested in these people, really taking a deep and personal interest in their day to day lives.  So, like any modern Muslim worth his salt, they shamelessly copied and adapted a pre-existing toxic culture and, in the process made it far worse by removing the ethnic exclusivity.  Just like Muslims rip off everything Western, after pissing on it and saying its evil, because they have no real culture themselves.  Islamic dietary laws are a less sophisticated (less cognitively challenging) branch of Kosher laws.  Islamic self-segregation is straight out of Judaism.  The whole ""killing one person is like killing the whole world"" innumerate feels-based retarded nonsense is lifted wholesale from the talmud.  Islam is almost as priest-centric as Judaism. There the rabbi is central to the working of their culture, deciding what is kosher and what is not, divining wisdom from the collection of hundreds of years of gobbledegook and basically intermediating and shaping the Jew's interaction with the rest of the world.  The ulema provide the exact same function, because, like Judaism, the compulsion to to everything in accordance with Allah-consciousness, makes it inevitable that an elite class of bullshit parsers is going to be vital for the average mentally challenged Muslim to navigate life.  Jews cannot even say the name of god and most go so far as to even not write God, preferring G_d. This is part of their general idea that god is beyond any human ability to ""know"". Which is translated and simplified (made stupid) into the Muslim's prohibition of making depictions of God or assigning gender to him or imagining him having human features (beyond hands, iirc).  Anyway, yes ... Islam is Judaism made simple for simple people."

I think this one of the reasons why Islam is so stunted culturally. It's anti-music, anti-poetry, anti-drawing and doesn't care much for literature. It's pretty much anti-art.  There are many Hadith wherein Muhammad says that people who draw at trying to imitate Allah's creation by drawing people, or that people who play instruments are cursed or that poetry is the most useless thing ever. Reasons aren't often given.  As for me: I love music and I'm falling more in love with it every day. I'm into electronic music: a lot of chillwave, electrojazz and hip hop.

Decreased brain freq. = decreased alertness = meditative state.  We all know how the religion feels about getting high. I doubt Mo knew any of this though.

The Ancient Greeks had ceremonial music and the Hindus had (and continue to have) music for specific times of day.  Google about the psychological studies of the impact of music, it's fascinating stuff from what I remember.  There are big stores in Japan that play a certain type of music to reduce incidences of shop lifting. There are American advertisers and brands that spend millions on getting the right little musical motif for their product/service, because it conveys particular values or specific encourages emotional responses that they desire."

His “mufti,” or top cleric, never finished school. He struggles to find ways to make his group stand out — their flag is the same as that of ISIS, but with the black and white colors flipped.  When one of his cronies boasts of planning a mass beheading, the “caliph” complains that he wants a new form of execution.  “Behead, behead, behead. That’s all you got?” he groans, before suggesting the captives be put in a freezer.   That doesn't resemble ISIS at all.  .   In another episode, two Saudi men meet at an airport in Europe and bond over their love of women, alcohol and hard partying.  Though neither is religious, their budding friendship takes a nosedive when they discover that one is Sunni and the other Shiite.  They argue until airport security arrests them, and when police find out they’re fighting over a split that happened 1,400 years ago, they send them both to a mental hospital.   .   And in the show’s most popular sketch, al-Qasabi plays a Saudi father whose son has run off to join ISIS. He smuggles himself into Syria, pretends to be a jihadi joining ISIS and tries to convince his son to return home.  It’s a more serious episode, showing his horror at ISIS’ “perversions” of Islam and at the group’s atrocities — and his torment as he tries to avoid committing atrocities himself in his disguise.  But it has comic moments as well, as he fumbles his way through militant training and is chased around the bed by a militant bride who is forced on him by the group and who has dedicated her life to pleasing jihadis as a means of going to heaven."

He said that we should donate a R1 coin to charity (practically worthless, can't even buy a few slices of bread) each night for the last 10 nights.

So, the Prophet said, ""I came out to inform you about the Night of Qadr but such-and-such persons were quarreling, so the news about it had been taken away; yet that might be for your own good, so search for it on the 29th, 27th and 25th (of Ramadan).   Bukhari 3:32:233   Narrated Abu Salama:  I asked Abu Sa'id, and he was a friend of mine, (about the Night of Qadr) and he said, ""We practiced Itikaf (seclusion in the mosque) in the middle third of the month of Ramadan with the Prophet . In the morning of the 20th of Ramadan, the Prophet came and addressed us and said, 'I was informed of (the date of the Night of Qadr) but I was caused to forget it; so search for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water (as a sign). So, whoever was in l'tikaf with me should return to it with me (for another 10-day's period)', and we returned. At that time there was no sign of clouds in the sky but suddenly a cloud came and it rained till rain-water started leaking through the roof of the mosque which was made of date-palm leaf stalks. Then the prayer was established and I saw Allah's Apostle prostrating in mud and water and I saw the traces of mud on his forehead."""

One part of the group waters it down to make it more appealing to newcomers, but then the other part feels that it's untrue to the core of the group and fights back by becoming more staunch.  This happened in the early days of Christianity. In an attempt to make the Gospel more appealing to Gentiles, Paul ruled that Gentiles didn't need to follow the law or be circumcised.

I don't expect much from Liberals, so I don't offer much in the way of civility. I will say this though, your condescension only makes more glaring the fatuousness of your comment.  A Muslim hates based upon the instruction of his master, nothing more. The traits and character of the people within that category do not interest him, so long as the category is not ""Islam"", it is his enemy.  I don't hate based on religious category, I hate based on the ideology and the broad traits of the people subscribing to it. It's not perfect, but it is wholly reasonable and appropriate.  Any ideology that views the world as its rightful possession, for whatever reason, is a threat to my way of life and my values. I may have libertarian leanings, but I would never support the promotion of them overseas, nor would I support any sort of interference overseas.  I've said time and again, if Muslims were not expansionist fascists, I would be perfectly happy to pretend to believe and just go along with it. I don't care that it's false, people are stupid and you either kill them or learn to live with them. I would learn to live with them.  Sadly, they are expansionist, there's no getting away from that.

I may have many awful memories regarding Islam, but I'm still going to treat Muslims I meet with respect. Up until almost a year ago, I was also a Muslim and to hate all Muslims would be equivalent to hating my old self. I don't think I was a different person then and know. I was just deceived about many things I believed.  Thumbs up for 40 year old virgin. I caught the reference."
exmuslim,3cnryr,CadmeusCain,-1,Thu Jul 9 15:35:04 2015 UTC,So in other words you have no rational arguments why claim is wrong.  Sure most Muslims are ordinary people who thinks gays/adulters/apostates should be murdered.
exmuslim,3cnryr,ShangZilla,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:04:01 2015 UTC,"So in other words you have no rational arguments why claim is wrong.    No I just don't want to tell you how to live your life. You are free to hate and love whoever you want for whatever reasons you want. I'm sure you feel that your reasons for hating Muslims are good.  Where I'm standing from however, I hardly ever feel justified hating large groups of people under blanket labels. There are almost 2 billion Muslims in the world, that's a lot of different people with different worldviews to hate. I also don't think hate solves much. There are some cases where hate is a good thing and is even preferable (for example, I would agree with you, our society should hate murderers).  I guess I'm more interested in finding a way to a way to live together. Most of my family are Muslim and I certainly don't hate them. I think it's quite reductionist to just label someone as a 'Muslim' as though that is the sum total of their identity. For some people it surely is. For most, Islam forms a part of who they are. One person in my family for instance is a Muslim doctor. He's perfectly rational in every other aspect of his life and is a nice person who I have a deep respect for. He also does Islamic religious practice. I see no reason to hate him for this.  I actually think one-dimensional hatred is discriminatory and bigoted. I don't think you actually behave this way in practice. I'm sure you don't hate every Muslim that you meet. If you did, I'd think you were being pretty unfair and it'll just make you see almost a quarter of the world's population as non-people or beneath you. I don't think that's healthy for you or for them."
exmuslim,3cnryr,CadmeusCain,-2,Thu Jul 9 15:11:03 2015 UTC,"The fact is that vast majority of Muslim, even the so called moderates approve of murder of apostates/homosexuals or blapshemers, that a fact. Vast majority Muslim are not directly violent themselves, but they are either approving or supporting right kind of Islamic violence.  I find it completely logical and justified to hate any group which behaves like it. This is no irrational hatred based on that someone has different skin color, this is logical hate based on facts and experience. For example tell a holocaust survivor that he should not hate Nazis. Tell him that your Nazi family just supported Hitler but didn't take part in the holocausting. His position of hate is completely rational and legitimate."
exmuslim,3cnryr,BaconSheikh,2,Thu Jul 9 15:22:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't say that your hatred was irrational. Most Muslims I know wouldn't support murder of apostates and homosexuals. But if they did, I would say they were being assholes. Most Muslims I know think gay people are filthy and I've had told people off for this and had fights with them because I think they're being bigoted assholes. This doesn't mean I automatically hate them and all their ilk.  I don't think your reasons are logical. I think they are rational and justified. From your worldview, you've established that it is perfectly fine to hate people based on an association with an ideology you consider immoral. I'm saying you can do that if you want, I just don't agree with you.  I don't expect you to stop doing if you feel you're justified. I'm just giving you an alternative perspective. You don't have to take it if you don't want to. In my personal experience, I find that I come into contact with Muslims so often on a daily basis and, for most intents and purposes, they behave like normal people. For me: hating them would make my own life more difficult and would just make it hard to get along with people I share space with.  EDIT: On a side note, I do actually hate the way most Muslims, including liberal modern ones, treat women. That I think is disgusting. I don't hate every Muslim I see because of this.

Humans are superbly adept at compartmentalizing different ideas, which is why you'll see some educated muslims in the west who can explain evolution to you in a scientific conversation, then deny it in a religious one.  In the same vein, people will support Mo with the blanket idea of him being a ""perfect"" human. At the same time, they (some, anyways) find pedophilia in today's day and age deplorable, and try to justify why it was okay then, and not now. Or that it wasn't even pedophilia (claiming people matured faster, or that Aisha was 18).  I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with you, but I think there's more to be said in this conversation about hating all Muslims because they believe in a religion that endorses pedophilia, re psychology of belief, and cognitive compartmentalization of ideas.

When a common man proclaims ""I have knowledge of such and such matter"" and he does not remember Allah, then know that the Last Hour has come. When the people bring together that which Allah has created separate, then know that the Last Hour has come.""  I don't know if this sounds any good....i imagine you can affix any hadith number to this."

Music, art, comedy, food, movies, etc. are not celebrated but actively demeaned as they take you away from God. That is such a narrow myopic view of the world. Why can't those things be a celebration of God?  Celebrating life in Islam, though most Muslims will tell you otherwise, is forbidden. All we were allowed to do is give its glory to God and move on. The main prize is the afterlife.  I feel terrible I was born into this religion, but I'm out and that's what's important."

exmuslim,3cm4nu,kingmoriarty,2,Thu Jul 9 19:06:52 2015 UTC,"My problem with Islam: The Quran is a rewrite of the Christian and Jewish myths which themselves were rewrites of previous myths. You only need to know about history and the geopolitics of the time to understand why Mohammed came up with the Quran.  We know that man invented Gods (more than 2500) over the last 150,000+ years to explain what he did not understand. The three Abrahamic religions talk about adam an eve and the big flood being real. We all know that this was not a historical account but an allegory taken from the Epic of Gilgamesh. Religious people either Jewish, Christian or Muslims have very hard times going against scientific facts showing the earth was not covered by 26 miles of water for a year.  Man was also not living to be 950 years old and the earth is not 6000 years old. we KNOW this and we can demonstrate it as being reality. So religions are coming in and denying this reality causing people to have delusions of reality.  Islam is probably the worst in the sense that it also creates an OCD behavior that constantly reinforce your fear every 3 to 5 hours (prayers) and you also have to face a certain direction too. If praying five times a day facing a certain direction is NOT OCD Behavior then I don t know what it is. Islam constantly makes the believer a ""slave"" to the religion. And lets not talk about the schisms within the religion itself...  The real problem with Islam is the fact that people will shut off the logic part of their brain and accept whatever they are told even if it borders on moronism. Mohammed flying to the moon on a winged horse to cut the moon in half makes me very sad when someone tells me it really happened and then trying to justify it. I then struggle to not ridicule the person and usually just drop the subject because it is impossible to reason with someone who has delusions of reality.  How did Mohammed fly in space? Did he hold his breath? Where is that winged horse from? We know the myth of pegasus from the Greeks so we know who and why that mythical beast was invented for narrative of greek epics...we know its not a real animal but Mohammed did not know. So that mythical horse is non existent and still Mohammed finds that horse, the horse stops breathing and then flies in space. Without air to use its wings, how was the horse able to gain momentum in space? How about re entry into the atmosphere? Oh Wait, Mohammed had no idea. Then there is the cutting of the moon in half...probably as a metaphor for the half moon cycle: Yep...I did it, I flew there and cut the moon in half...even tho Mohammed had no idea what the moon was (a source of light??).  We could go on and on with errors made by someone who had no scientific knowledge at the time and was pandering to people who were even less smart than him.  Anyway, asking a Muslim why God revealed himself to a illiterate middle eastern guy instead of the the Egyptians or Chinese who already had great civilizations...nope, makes so much more sense to take 23 years to make someone memorize things.  1400 years ago people could make up stuff and had no idea what the world was and how it worked...nowadays we know better.  Any person that leaves a religion no matter which one is a person that regains the logic and critical thinking part of the brain and that person should be applauded because THEY can now improve the world and advance humanity... prayers and the denial of reality does not."
exmuslim,3cm4nu,Neverdied,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:56:52 2015 UTC,"What a great post and good comments. Looking at Islam from a non-religious point of view, it's actually really impressive that a man from 7th century Arabia would be able to come up with something like this and get people to revere him for 1400+ years. Muhammad gets my respect for that but the religion he preached is definitely not something that should be implemented.  He seemed to be going for some kind of world domination tactic and intended to keep the masses equivalent to something like sheep. With his rapid expansion (which continued after his death) and horribly restrictive religion, it just seems like something out of a world domination movie.   But yeah I completely agree with OP's point on how if everyone just sat and ""did as they were supposed to"" (worship God) then we'd be horribly ignorant and still think that it's Allah's might that cause water to fall from the sky (still can't believe with all the ""scientific miracles"" that the Quran happened to guess the Big Bang but completely skip the Water Cycle; not that it actually predicted the Big Bang but whatever).   Honestly, even if I believed Islam was real and true, I don't think I'd actually wanna go to heaven. I don't remember where I heard this (I'll look for a source later) but I remember hearing that the inhabitants of Hell Fire will ask those who occupy Paradise to try and convince God to let them out. And of course, us being super righteous, will tell all the people that were just born into the wrong religion that it's their fault for earning an eternity of cruel and unusual punishments (sorry the concept of Hell gets me really riled up).   Great post and I don't intend to sit down and worship a God that the Quran describes. I feel like the best way to worship a god that created the universe (if there is one) would be to learn about the universe he created and seek to understand it not sit together and praise him like sheep; he doesn't really need that.   Edit: This was what I was talking about when it came to hell people talking to heaven people:   And the companions of the Fire will call to the companions of Paradise, ""Pour upon us some water or from whatever Allah has provided you."" They will say, ""Indeed, Allah has forbidden them both to the disbelievers."" 7:50   Turns out it was about giving them water, something way simpler, instead of getting them out. If I were to enter ""Paradise"" it looks like I'd lose my capability to feel empathy for my fellow humans. Not something I want"
exmuslim,3cm4nu,sanjithecook,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:59:48 2015 UTC,"There is more to life than the worship of allah. even if all this worship and God stuff is true, and it was in the midst of a whole universe undiscovered and un learnt, I would not limit myself in accordance with Allahs plans because I AM FREE. and the fact that you will burn me for that, shows who the martyrs really are. It's good to note however, that it's more than likely not true. So go out there, dance, listen, learn, love, laugh, and understand that the only reason you can do that is because you are free. If we can't have freedom, we will have anarchy. We were born this way, we are humans, we are born with the need to be free. What's more plausible, that some invisible dude created you that way so he can burn you for it later on, Or that there is no invisible dude and you are really free?   Wow. Just.

exmuslim,3cm4nu,veizla,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:55:00 2015 UTC,"Great post. Two things that come to mind:  i) If the Quran is meant for both Jinns and humans, it's remarkable that such a disproportionate amount of it deals with humans. If I was a jinn, I'd think, fuck this Allah guy, where's my saving message? After all, we're 'told' that there are evil jinns - but somehow they're not really worthy of salvation.  ii) The fact that Islam works so hard to proscribe entire parts of human experience (intoxication, music, sex) is an indication to me of it's lack of universality. People can find enormous intrinsic value through a lot of those behaviors, and yet Islam forbids them, implicitly declaring any meaning realized through these behaviors to be null."

exmuslim,3cllds,bman0001,7,Thu Jul 9 12:46:30 2015 UTC,"No there isn't. There is no difference whatsoever. A person has the right to reach a conclusion and the right to express how he/she arrived at that conclusion. If someone asks an apostate why he left Islam, hears the reasoning, and decide he also agrees, that is not a crime. That's the failure of one idea to withstand another idea. What you are saying is keep your mouth shut, stay in the closet, or die.  Why should the religious structures of society be protected from attack?"
exmuslim,3cllds,bman0001,2,Thu Jul 9 12:49:37 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what ""transgressive"" apostasy is. An apostate spoke to a Muslim. The Muslim decided Islam is bullshit and became an apostate. The Ummah has been diminished by one Muslim. Islam has been damaged. Behead them both!  ""Transgressive"" is a purposefully vague and moving definition, as is ""harming Islam""."

You act as if this term is defined unilaterally by yourself or some particular authority. It isn't. It's a rule of convenience designed to silence dissent. Even just publicly stating ""I am not Muslim"" in a Muslim country is enough to make at least one Muslim listening think ""Maybe I don't have to be Muslim either"", and that is enough to claim the Ummah as been damaged.

A man whose religion was Islam and his nationality is Egyptian married a German Christian and the couple agreed that the husband would join the Christian faith and doctrine.  1) What is the Islamic ruling in relation to this man? What are the punishments prescribed for this act?  2) Are his children considered Muslim or Christian?  The Answer: All praise is to Allah, the Lord of the Universe and salutations on the leader of the righteous, our master Muhammed, his family and all of his companions. Thereafter: This man has committed apostasy; he must be given a chance to repent and if he does not then he must be killed according to Shariah. As far as his children are concerned, as long as they are children they are considered Muslim, but after they reach the age of puberty, then if they remain with Islam they are Muslim, but if they leave Islam and they do not repent they must be killed and Allah knows best.

I'm not the local Sunni muslim representative, I'm assuming you can fill in. If you're trying to say that their are secular reasons for maintaining a law that, let's be honest, comes from an interpretation of the Prophet's words, then I think you consider Islam to be a little too exceptional.  Islam is laughable for many reasons, one of which is that it holds that a man flew up to heaven on a winged donkey. It is also barbaric and cruel because it mandates permanent amputation for any degree of  theft.

Stop skirting the issue, since you have no point in this discussion. This thread is about Al Qaradawi, and now you move the flag to ""other scholars"".   And let's not forget that the ulama were exceedingly patient with potential apostates, granting them the chance to explain any problematic religious statements they may have made. 'The speaker is to be asked about his intended meaning' was a standard procedural principle.    Death penalty is exceedingly patient?  A chance to explain? Why should he stand in a trial in the first place? Apostasy is not a crime.  Would you be ok if Islam converts are to be tried and killed?

Then he eventually left the religion (and I assume he told my parents but we don't really talk about religion too much)  As for me, I pulled myself into Islam with the influence of a single Islamic teacher and then pulled myself out this summer after breaking that mental lens that comes from indoctrination.

For as long as I can remember he's always had to go to an Islamic school after regular school and has always hated it. Probably because my parents never actually explained why we pray and why we should memorize Qur'an. They just kind of expected him to do it. So I think he always grew up thinking of Islam (and maybe religion in general) as a chore instead of a way of life. He'd never pray at home and would always secretly break his fasts (I'd catch him sometimes). Then when he got older and entered high school he wouldnt go to any Islamic school and wouldnt do anything related to Islam. Basically just abandoned it while my parents were trying to push him back into praying.  I don't think they ever realized (they're trying to do the same thing to my little sister now, except she's older than he was, and she absolutely hates it as well so I guess they didn't learn) that they've been pushing him away and I think at one point he just told them that he wasn't going to follow the religion anymore (I wasn't around for that I guess).   His relationship with my parents is still really good even after he left which gives me some pretty good hopes (also makes me grateful because I know there are a ton of people on here whose parents completely abandon them after they renounce their faith). He lives with some friends as he's finishing college but still comes back to visit a lot. But yeah that's about as much as I know about his relationship with religion. I don't know if he's practicing a religion right now but I'd probably say he isn't. If you have any other questions I'd be happy to answer them if I can"

Mainly after I realized how a majority of my Muslim friends (now ex-friends) condemned me for instigating/provoking, or worse, approved of my death after the Charlie Hebdo incident had I been the one to draw a Muhammad cartoon. Usually I kept my atheism private and just among close friends, but as soon as the #notmyprophet #jenesuispascharlie hashtags covered my newsfeed I decided to go on a rampage and posted dozens and dozens of articles and videos from ex-muslim sources to weed these fundies out and have removed over 40 people from my life (I find it scary I knew this many considering i only had 600 friends on fb). With that said, I wouldn't mind hitting up the Toronto meetup to really see the vibrance of the ex moose community for myself cause right now I only know of 4 ex-muslims personally and then there's Ali A Rizvi, and that's kinda depressing. You can get back to me on whether or not my attendance is allowed.

In 1978, the Taraki government initiated a series of reforms, including a radical modernization of the traditional Islamic civil society.  During its first 18 months of rule, the PDPA applied a Soviet-style program of modernizing reforms, many of which were viewed by conservatives as opposing Islam.[51] Decrees setting forth changes in marriage customs and land reform were not received well by a population deeply immersed in tradition and Islam,"

In 2006 an estimated 57 percent of men and 87 percent of women were illiterate, and the lack of skilled and educated workers was a major economic disadvantage.   Beginning with the Soviet invasion of 1979, successive wars virtually destroyed the education system. Most teachers fled the country during the Soviet occupation and the subsequent civil war.

The maid in my friend's house was Shia and her children were in that school. I can never forget how terrified she was.   The second incident which was even more horrible happened when we were coming back from an important gathering. Apparently Americans had burned some Qurans and people had heard about it and they were rioting. The driver took us back to our guest's house.

It's because not only do I already know the laws of physics, thereby knowing the result of the test (those in the air with potential energy will fall, and that in rest on the ground won't move), I set up the test so that some of them would fail.  Similarly, Allah not only knows exactly how the test will play out due to his omniscience, but he actually created you and me knowing what kind of people we are, some of us naturally more skeptical. In addition, he created our environment fully aware that it would lead us to questioning Islam, or never considering Islam as a religion.  God is the human testing tennis balls.

It of course fell short because he said this life is a test and you can't just ask the teacher the answers to the test.  He claims that we chose to be humans and we could've been angels but we wanted to be better than them and knew the answers to the test. Apparently we forgot those answers and the teacher is handing out contradicting cheat sheets to certain students where only one is right.

Am I the only one that's never even heard that argument before? I feel like, after going to Islamic school for like 8 years, someone would've mentioned that we had the opportunity to be angels. Maybe I'm wrong and if someone can give me a verse in the Quran that says we could've been angels, then please enlighten me cause I've never heard of anything like that  Edit: Okay so he's using 33:72 to justify some story about us being asked to be angels but that's way too much inferring. All the verse says is that man decided to bear the test. Obviously no one can remember that we decided to bear the test but I've never heard anything about this story of potentially being angels"

If people want to be polyamorous and decide to have multiple sexual partners, they shouldn't be slut shamed, no matter what the gender. We are humans, sex is part of our nature. The problem is religion has always held men in higher regard, allowing them to marry several wives and such. Women on the other hand had to be loyal to their own husband and were beaten to death if they decided to have another partner. This mentality has caused people nowadays to call any woman who sleeps around a slut, and any man who sleeps around a ""player"".   I am a guy, I tend to sleep around. Does anyone bat an eyelid? No. But when one of my friends who is female slept with ONE person, everyone started calling her a disgusting whore. Heck, even when one of my friends confessed that she masturbated she was called a whore for masturbating.  The only time when people can be shamed for sex is when they are cheating. Any person who engages in polyamory without the consent of their partner is a disgusting slut, no matter what gender."

exmuslim,3ckga5,lacedup_,14,Wed Jul 8 21:36:13 2015 UTC,"I've experienced this as well growing up in an Indian community. Muslim guys sleeping with non-Muslim girls are just ""boys being boys"". Often these ""boys"" would brag about their sexual conquests. On the other hand, if a Muslim girl is even chatting to a guy too forwardly in public, she's considered a slut. Most Indian girls I know are extremely sexually repressed and conservative in their relationships because they value their chastity so highly. It's not the same with the guys.  It's actually a cliche story that a guy will go around dating and sleeping with various girls until it's time to settle down at which point he'll marry a nice girl who's never even held another guy's hand. Many Indian Muslim girls I know do have boyfriends, but they are extremely secretive about it. If their parents knew they would not approve.  It is actually supported by Islam and Indian culture. In Islam, female chastity is of the highest priority and the idea that a girl can sleep with anyone but her husband is seen as the most heinous, grievous of offences worthy of being stoned to death for. But if you read the Quran and Islamic histories, it's perfectly ok for men to have up to four wives to have sex with their female slaves as often as they want to; before marriage and during marriage. Very often when the Muslim armies, even during Mo's time, would go wage war they'd be away from their wives. In this case, Mo explicitly allowed them to take female captives and have sex with them. So yeah... Male chastity means nothing in Islam.  P.S. On the whole anal thing. I don't know what warped logic leads one to the conclusion that having anal sex but not vaginal sex means one is still a virgin. F'd up!"

If you are working part-time (4 hours), you'll have 20 hours left in the day.  Minus sleep (8 hours) = 12 hours left.   Minus bathroom time/getting ready (30 mins) = 11.5 hours left.   Minus school time (6 hours) = 5.5 hours left.   Tell your dad you've extra classes for preparation of university (2 hours) = 3.5 hours left.   Minus commuting to and from school (1 hour est.) = 2.5 hours.   Minus homework time (2.5 hours) = 0 hours left!  Plan for Weekends  Try to work full-time on weekends. If you can't work full-time, tell your dad you're working full-time. You are working on your computer anyways. So when you finish your part-time work, just stay online. Connect with us on /r/exmuslim.  Full-time work (8 hours) = 16 hours left.  Minus sleep (8 hours) = 8 hours left.   Minus bathroom time (30 mins) = 7.5 hours left  Tell your dad that you are preparing for your final year of school, so that you can get admission to a good university.   Minus studying and homework time (3 hours) = 4.5 hours.  Do some chores around the house (washing dishes, taking out garbage, cleaning the house, do laundry, do the groceries).  Minus chore time (1 hour) = 3.5 hours  Tell your dad you need to exercise since you are sitting long hours at your desk and your back is hurting.  Minus exercise (1 hour) = 2.5 hours left  Nap time (1.5 hours) = 1 hour left  Cook for your family. If you don't know how to, learn! This can serve you well while you're at your university.   Minus cooking time (1 hour) = 0 hours left!  You can always add more useful activities throughout your day. Hope this helps. And stay clear of moulanas."

exmuslim,3cnnr1,sanjithecook,4,Thu Jul 9 08:54:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like Jinns are more far fetch'd than angels though. Jinns are like humans, but they're made of fire, they have religions like us and can see us but somehow live in a different plane of existence so we can't see them. They live in all the abandoned places of the world and some are good and some are evil. I'm pretty sure if there were creatures that were at our level of intelligence, there'd be some implications"
exmuslim,3cnnr1,DJSVN_,2,Thu Jul 9 08:57:06 2015 UTC,"For me, angels tops it with the weird hierarchy and no free-will whatsoever.  God could easily just do all this stuff on his own.  It's like he's outsourcing jobs.    I heard that jinn:   Have free will Can be good or evil Can be Muslim or non-Muslim  Live in unclean places Like to haunt people's houses like spooky cartoon ghosts Pull an Exorcist and invade someone's body Enter the vaginas of virgin women and invisibly rape them which makes them impure   This is the first time I've heard of jinn having their own Silent Hill universe."
exmuslim,3cnnr1,DJSVN_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:16:47 2015 UTC,"Can be Muslim or non-Muslim   That's a good one. According to Christianity I believe this would be blasphemy. Once you're a fallen Angel you become a demon (not in the horror movie sense, but maybe possibly? depending on the sect) and now since you're fucked, the only thing you can do, in a statement of petty anger is to take as many human souls with you to hell.   Also lol @    Enter the vaginas of virgin women and invisibly rape them which makes them impure   So...is that like a good cover up story? What happens to these girls? Do they get an exorcism?...Down there?"
exmuslim,3cnnr1,Molotova,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:38:50 2015 UTC,Jinn aren't the same as angels.  They're kind of like a different species I believe.  Satan (Shaytan) in Islam is a disobedient jinni who refused to bow to Adam.
exmuslim,3cnnr1,robotroller,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:54:41 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I know that, I just meant from a Christian point of view, djinn would probably be classified as evil spirits. In Christianity only the Angels are good and all the spirits that are on Earth are evil. There is no second classification of spirits (not counting if some sects believe in human souls staying on the Earth...I'm not super keen on it anymore since it's been a while).    So in effect, saying that these bad spirits can somehow start worshiping God on Earth is very blasphemous. The qualities that djinn possess are similar to fallen Angels in Christianity (haunting houses, possession) so that was the middle ground of similarity I was seeing in my head.  The only reason I point this out is because Muhammad said that this is the same Jewish and Christian Allah. Guess he didn't do his research on that major difference.  Also, haunting Vaginas and stuff. Don't think anything like that is in the Bible at all. Although is this written in the Koran or is it just some overzealous Muslim preacher making things sensational."
exmuslim,3cnnr1,FlyboyRocks,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:33:35 2015 UTC,Jinn aren't inherently evil though.  The jinn rape thing comes form a crazy Wahabi lecture and not the Qur'an.  :)

Yes, it is rude, I feel like being rude towards India, for having given life to so many retards.  At the same time, I have tremendous respect for the elites of India, in taking such a diverse, chaotic and over populated country and building a first world tech and media economy within it. Creating huge pools of highly skilled technical labour and managing to compete at the only game that matters - the space race.  I hope Indian society improves, that the Liberals and Muslims are contained and prevented from damaging India and, that in time I can return to the land of my ancestors.  Eugenics is actually a British idea, from the late 18th century, iirc. Partly born of attempts to explain criminality amongst the lower classes in Britain, partly as an attempt to boost the ego and morale of the British upper classes by delineating a heritage completely separate from the chaos of the lower orders and the more ""savage"" Europeans.  The Scandinavians, Americans (US and Canada) and Brits were the first to actually implement Eugenics-based social policies, in the early 1900s, if I'm not mistaken. Decades before Hitler and his ilk came on the scene. In fact the Germans took the ideas from the work of the US.  There is something to the underlying notion, I'm sure, it's just not PC to talk about it bluntly."

exmuslim,3cjwg8,ZeeyardSA,5,Mon Jul 20 13:04:01 2015 UTC,"I got hit by belts, ropes, chairs, metal rulers, basically whatever was in my father's hand or vicinity. The reason? Because I didn't want to go to Quran classes or memorize Surahs.   The only thing that is needed is understanding. Understanding that you getting angry is not going to solve anything. It's a waste of time and energy. Why not transform your anger into something positive?  For example, as you said, there are awful things going on in the name of religion. Instead of just getting angry about it, why not raise awareness? You can start your own blog or YT channel where you raise awareness about it.   How I deal with anger is that whenever any situation brings about anger in me, I just observe it, watch it, witness it. I try to understand that it is useless to get angry. Slowly it fades away.  Don't repress your anger. When you get angry next time, get into your anger, be angry totally. Scream, shout, swear if you have to. But as you are getting angry, observe it. Then slowly, understanding arises that it is ridiculous to be angry."

Look at how many of those acts of ""religious conviction"" are committed by a racial or ethnic majority against a minority, like this one in Quetta   I grew up as a Christian, and I know from reading a lot of history that this happened in the Christian world also.

exmuslim,3cjwg8,daguro,5,Wed Jul 8 14:37:46 2015 UTC,"As a child I was always aware that I was treated differently to all my Bangladeshi and Pakistani friends. Neither my father nor my mother ever physically disciplined me and I never gave them cause through shameful/disrespectful behaviour.  I witnessed several friends being beaten, it was quite distressing, both in seeing parents unload so much and seeing children, friends, peers who were so utterly devoid of reason and wit and behaving so recklessly. Most of those friends have grown up to be very religious family men. Some, after years of heroine abuse and some without any incident.  I also witnessed the bullying and occasional physical violence meted out to my English friends, by domineering mothers, in the main. This was usually when they'd performed badly in school or had done something wrong.  My feeling is that this kind of violence comes from self-loathing. Disappointment with your own performance, leading to overbearing pressure and astronomical expectations for your children, combined with the undercurrent of fear that they too will be ""failures"".  Victims too can become horrible creatures, perverted by their trauma. And most Muslims are the result of colonisation. One that we never even speak of."

Nothing, a single dot infinitely small (mathematically, it's 0 of size and infinite density) with nothing beyond it? But is this state of things even possible? Why having certain physical conditions inevitably leads us to abiogenesis and emergence of life? Why are physical constants are that and that, for example Planck constants, and not that? How can we confirm existence of Boltzmann brains? What is the nature of dark energy in the Universe? Why we see the Fibonacci sequence in nature?  Also small simple things: why the fuck am i seeing the signs and patterns everywhere (i'm not crazy, very very often i think about something, i immediately get a sign. For example, sometimes i get out of my home, some random thought pops up in my mind out of nowhere or an image (for example, i, for some reason, think about a seven-pointed star after waking up, no idea why this thought comes to my head when i'm in my bed, i brush my teeth, eat my breakfast, wear my clothes, leave, then look at the sky while walking down the street and… yeah, i see the fucking star image. Or i start thinking ""why the hell did SkyNet choose to kill Reeze? No one knew he is Connor's dad excluding long-dead Sarah and John himself"", no idea why, i haven't seen Terminator movies since childhood, then i decide to check TV schedule, and what do i see then? Yeah, fucking Terminator movie, the very same fucking day this shit came out into my mind). Wouldn't care about a few of them, but i literally notice at least a dozen of them each month! Think it's the God showing me It's here. Consider me a psycho if you wish."
exmuslim,3cjptj,FemaleInfidel,8,Wed Jul 8 15:19:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're a psycho at all. It sounds in general like you're using God as a catch-all term to explain anything that you don't understand or that seems too patterned to have been random chance.  I don't think this is a problem or something that needs to be corrected. Your God beliefs as they are certainly don't suggest any kind of action that hurts other people. I do think however that there are many answers to questions you have or a lack of an answer. God however is a non-answer.  For instance:   what did cause the Big Bang and what had been there before it happened?   The correct answer is: ""We don't know"". In the future it is likely that someone will manage to figure it out and it will reveal yet more things we do not know. Right now, we're unsure if it makes sense to speak of the Big Bang having a 'cause' or if a 'before' exists. As far as we can tell, time is a property of our universe. If time starts at the Big Bang, there isn't a before. This doesn't answer why there was a Big Bang in the first place. In time perhaps we will know.   Why having certain physical conditions inevitably leads us to abiogenesis and emergence of life?   If you've studied complexity or chaos, then you know that emergent properties can arise naturally out of even simple initial conditions. Google Conway's Game of Life and maybe play it a bit yourself to see. Some initial conditions lead to the formation of self-replicating organisms. It is the Anthropic Principle that we'd only be a alive in such a universe because a non-life permitting universe wouldn't have us in it. There may be many other universes that don't permit life. We just wouldn't be in them.   Why are physical constants are that and that, for example Planck constants, and not that? How can we confirm existence of Boltzmann brains? What is the nature of dark energy in the Universe? Why we see the Fibonacci sequence in nature?   These are all great questions. Many people are spending their lives trying to figure them out. I think the Fibonacci one might have already been answered. I'm not sure.   why the fuck am i seeing the signs and patterns everywhere (i'm not crazy, very very often i think about something, i immediately get a sign. For example, sometimes i get out of my home, some random thought pops up in my mind out of nowhere or an image (for example, i, for some reason, think about a seven-pointed star after waking up, no idea why this thought comes to my head when i'm in my bed, i brush my teeth, eat my breakfast, wear my clothes, leave, then look at the sky while walking down the street and… yeah, i see the fucking star image.   You're not crazy. This phenomenon has been studied quite deeply in psychology. Human beings display much pattern seeking behaviour. We often see patterns when there aren't any, and one of the reasons why is because of the Confirmation Bias i.e. we tend to circle the hits and ignore the misses.  For example, many people have a dream that met a friend and then the next day they're out and they run into that friends brother and they call it a hit. But they don't count all the times that they had a dream and it didn't come true. To have an honest analysis: you should count all the times you thought of something and then encountered it, all the times you thought of something and didn't encountered it, all the times you didn't think of something and encountered it and all the times you didn't think of something and din't encounter it. You can then perform a Bayesian Analysis to see if there's actually something there.  You can actually perform a much simpler analysis by making a note every time you think of a movie, and then check that day if it is coming on TV. You'll see that most times you just don't see the movie. What you've done is drawn significance to the one time it happened.   If you're interesting look up Cold Reading (which operates on this principle) as well as experiments into pattern seeking behaviour. I don't think you're crazy. All I'm saying is that there may be explanations for some of the phenomena you've mentioned that you may not yet be aware of."

exmuslim,3cjptj,mushinkou,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:06:02 2015 UTC,"Certain religions and certain religious ideologies have no respect for: -Individuality- -Women rights- -Personal space- If you want me to explain more about the three, I'll write a longer post."
exmuslim,3cjptj,IzmailPirzada,3,Wed Jul 8 14:17:15 2015 UTC,"Sure. I'm interested if you're willing to explain further.  Islam is definitely against all three. The concept of an 'Ummah', of a 'Muslim Community' wherein all religious practice is a public affair (communal prayers, religious law, public fasting) is certainly against individuality. Islam in it's current form is one of the most anti-Women religions that currently exist. And personal space? Well Islam does try to regulate what you think, what you wear and how you behave in private."
exmuslim,3cjptj,IzmailPirzada,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:27:33 2015 UTC,"I'm interested as well.  Also if I may ask, what do you think about Christianity in relation to those three? I consider myself an atheist, but legally I need to be registered as a member of ""approved"" religion by my country or else I will face severe discrimination. If I need to be registered in one, I'd like to be in one that respects all those three (since Islam is definitely against them, especially on women rights). Since my extended family is a mix of Muslims and Christians, I don't think my family would object so much if I ""leave"" Islam for Christianity, therefore I'd like to hear what do you think about it."

Now imagine if the situation would be reversed."

exmuslim,3ck5ko,Zulfikarr,3,Wed Jul 8 18:30:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe in some middle-eastern countries (though anonymous studies show very few leave the religion there as well).   In America, 77% of people raised Muslim remain Muslim, while the 23% we lose are replaced by converts (according to PEW).   Compare that to Christianity and the Unaffiliated, who lose around half of their members to apostasy (though the unaffiliated here makes it back + more in converts)."

Yes thank you for backing up u/Zulfikarr's points with facts.   Muslims act like the mafia in the middle east when you try to leave  Muslims act like the mafia in the US when you try to leave   ...And Muslims make it a POINT to act like the mafia because ""Apostasy"" is a word they like to use a lot (much like the ever popular ""Kaffir/Infidel"") when compared to all the other religions that are adjusting contemporary (and morally and ethically GROWING and ADAPTING) with society providing their followers the space to think for themselves and choose them out of love for the religion and not fear like a jealous, insecure boyfriend."

This is not limited to Muslims. Anyone who puts honour and pride and all that bullshit over love. Especially when it involves their own children.  One must never let love be dictated by pride or any other value or emotion. Love needs to exist on its own. And sometimes it's Scarry to love that way.  But its the only way to love and only way one can feel the wonder of being loved and loving unconditionally.

Use a chair at the mosque if you have to and day-dream about the things you really like whilst the imam is spewing his verses. Obviously, your mother is behaving like this because she loves you and does not want you to end up in make-believe hell, ironically not realizing the real hell she's creating with her inadvertent emotional abuse.

Get out of your American bubble thinking America is the perfect country. It's not. It's far from it. Look at your gun laws, look at your Churches, look at the fact that teaching evolution in schools is still a controversy, look at the hardcore capitalism.

If you've been monitoring the Ultra Orthodox Jews here, you'll notice how they're growing. Fast. They leech on the economy. Soon enough, they'll make life here unbearable and very religious, and also Israel has many other problems, like the conflict with Palestinians which I want to get away from, and many other problems that aren't visible to someone who doesn't live here. It's a great place to visit for now, before the Ultra Orthodox take over, but I don't want to live here."

Though you may be restricted in flesh, your mind is free of the backwardness of 7th century Arabia which lives on today in the form of Islam. It is only a matter of time till you are completely free.

exmuslim,3ch2tt,_larrystylinson_,4,Tue Jul 7 21:49:20 2015 UTC,"Something similar happened shortly after Mohammad's death   The Kaaba has been repaired and reconstructed many times since Muhammad's day. The structure was severely damaged by fire on 3 Rabi I (Sunday, 31 October 683), during the first siege of Mecca in the war between the Umayyads and Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr, an early Muslim who ruled Mecca for many years between the death of ʿAli and the consolidation of Umayyad power. Ibn al-Zubayr rebuilt it to include the hatīm.He did so on the basis of a tradition (found in several hadith collections) that the hatīm was a remnant of the foundations of the Abrahamic Kaaba, and that Muhammad himself had wished to rebuild so as to include it. The Kaaba was bombarded with stones in the second siege of Mecca in 692, in which the Umayyad army was led by al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf. The fall of the city and the death of Ibn al-Zubayr allowed the Umayyads under ʿAbdu l-Malik ibn Marwan to finally reunite all the Islamic possessions and end the long civil war. In 693 AD, ʿAbdu l-Malik had the remnants of al-Zubayr's Kaaba razed, and rebuilt on the foundations set by the Quraysh. The Kaaba returned to the cube shape it had taken during Muhammad's time. During the Hajj of 930 AD, the Qarmatians attacked Mecca, defiled the Zamzam Well with the bodies of pilgrims and stole the Black Stone, taking it to the oasis region of Eastern Arabia known as al-Aḥsāʾ, where it remained until the Abbasids ransomed it in 952 AD. The basic shape and structure of the Kaaba have not changed since then. After heavy rains and flooding in 1629, the walls of the Kaaba collapsed and the Masjid was damaged. The same year, during the reign of Murad IV, the Kaaba was rebuilt with granite stones from Mecca and the Masjid was renovated.The Kaaba's appearance has not changed since then."

Well, obviously, Allah had all the time to clarify whether Mo could break taboos by marrying his adopted son's ex-wife! however, absolutely forgot to clarify issues that allow widely diverging groups to call themselves true Muslims!  So here is the question! Did the shia rituals of Muharram in anyway made your think about your faith?"
exmuslim,3cg4eh,wooowman93,5,Tue Jul 7 18:08:31 2015 UTC,"Well in the Qur'an, it does talk about diverging groups (sects), see 6:159.  Ahh Muharram. More important than Ramadan. More important than Eid. They are obsessed with this. To them Karbalaa was the most righteous and honorable battle for justice.  The rituals didn't really make me question my faith. I didn't really like participating, but it wasn't so bad in my community whereas in others they cut them selves with swords and beat themselves with chains. In my community, we would first gather for what was basically a majlis. The speaker would tell the story of Hussein and Karbalaa and then everyone starts crying and wailing. I had to force myself to cry just to fit in, like thinking about relatives that passed. So I can only assume many others did the same. After the majlis someone would sing a nasheed or poem and the men would stand around and pound their chests with their hands."

There is no real resentment towards any other religion, they really push for an ""all religions, are religions of peace"" but this is probably because Ahmadiyya are masters of manipulating the text (they invented the ""contradictary"" hadiths on Aisha's age of marriage).   They only really hold resentment towards the mullahs who advocate the persecution of Ahmaddiyyas, which is fair. And they constantly refer to people as Ahmadiyyas and non-Ahmadiyyas."

exmuslim,3cg4eh,noodlewith0butter,7,Tue Jul 7 18:08:23 2015 UTC,"The most important thing that makes Shia distinct is their view of the successor to Mo. Twelvers believe that Mo chose Ali bin Abi Talib as his successor at Ghadir. The next successor was Hassan bin Ali, then his brother Hussein. The next 9 imams are decedents of Hussein. Shia believe the twelfth imam, Mahdi, went into occultation and believe his is still alive, hidden, and will come back to destroy evil and bring about justice to the world. And then he's gonna meet up with Jesus and kick some infidel ass.   I thought somewhat poorly of Sunnis. It is taught that the imams are infallible and are perfect human beings, just a notch under Mo. The idea that someone (Sunnis) can disregard the holy family and choose to follow a fallible leader (Abu Bakr, and so on) seemed like insanity to me. I felt that most Sunnis were just ignorant and would one day discover the glories of Ahl-al-Bayt and change their ways.   How were Shia portrayed in your community?"
exmuslim,3cg4eh,PeaceAndDressings,7,Tue Jul 7 18:25:42 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the shia perspective :). I have always wondered what they are taught about sunnis.   Shias are viewed as a misguided sect of Islam who worship there imams and that Sunni Islam is the true straight path. We where also taught that Shias believe the angel Gabriel made a mistake when he came to Muhammad and that it was Ali who was supposed to be the chosen one. I always believed that Sunni Islam was the original Islam Muhammad intended for mankind and that Shias where a ""Weird misguided sect that went astray "". Shias are sometimes even viewed as kufars in the Sunni community. Also, Abu bakr and Aisha are viewed in a very high esteem and we were taught that Shias hated them ( Which is viewed as haraaaam) and where therfore not true Muslims."
exmuslim,3cg4eh,Antinatalist_Human,5,Tue Jul 7 18:48:39 2015 UTC,You're welcome! :)  The Gabriel thing... I remember hearing about that but I cannot confirm if that is standard Shia doctrine or if that's a belief of one of the offshoot groups.  Mo was chosen by big Al so the Shia take the position that he should also choose Mo's successor. To elect the successor is viewed to them as a hijacking of the religion.   Abu Bakr? Hate. Umar? Hate. Urthman? Muawiyah? Aisha? Hate with a god damn passion. They are hated (and cursed) because each of them at some point fucked with one of the Imams.
exmuslim,3cg4eh,EnBk1001,3,Tue Jul 7 18:56:19 2015 UTC,Abu Bakr? Hate. Umar? Hate. Urthman? Muawiyah? Aisha? Hate with a god damn passion. They are hated (and cursed) because each of them at some point fucked with one of the Imams.   That is actually funny to me because in the Sunni community they are all viewed in the most exalted of ways. Especially Abu Bakr. He is viewed as Muhammad's best friend and as the most righteous man to have walked the earth in the eyes of Allah after only Muhammad. Aisha is called the mother of the believers and it is also believed that she benefited Islam greatly and that she was Muhammad's most favourite wife.

exmuslim,3cgncs,Mojomaniac666,3,Tue Jul 7 19:44:32 2015 UTC,"He thinks evolution is true for all animals and that humans have been evolving ever since God made them from clay. He justifies that the remains that are claimed to have been the bones of human ancestors are actually another species related to monkeys that is quite similar to humans, and had died out before God made man. The mental gymanstics are strong, and like I said he's very difficult to beat in argument, and to beat him in this I would have to step out of the bounds of Islam, which would spark worry about my way of thinking.  What really got him thinking though was when I mentioned that flogging is a form of torture and asked why is it in Saudi law as a punishment. He told me that he agrees and that it shouldn't be there. My mother who was sitting there then proceeded to mention how it mentions in the Quran that flogging is to be used as a punishment. He tried to say how that it's supposed to be in context and that Quranic scholars can justify how it doesn't work out in the current time, which is a direct contradiction to how Islam is meant to be perfect for all humans in all eras as it is claimed. I decided to stop talking, but I did notice that he got very slightly flustered and confused.  Regarding the flat Earth issue I don't think any Muslim actually believes that the Earth is flat. The wording used in the Quran is vague as well so you can't come at any conclusion about the matter."

He will then probably mention how the testicles descend during embryogenesis from the abdominal cavity (i.e. from between ribs and spine) into the scrotum, which is correct. However, sperm production only starts during puberty, long after the testicles arrived in the scrotum, so the koranic claim is clearly wrong. You can also ask why the koran never mentions the egg (obviously because it is too small to see so they didn't know). Actually, the old Greeks already believed that sperm come from between the ribs and spine, so it is easy where that idea came from. Also, the koran doesn't mention 'sperm' per se, but rather the ejaculate as a whole as they weren't aware spermatozoa existed.  There's an interesting article about the whole issue here: http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Science/semenproduction.htm  I would love to hear how your dad would explain that one away.

Its the difference between leaving a conversation close ended and leaving it open ended depending on what results and expectations you favor from the 2nd person.  In this case, OP doesn't really want to hurt his father, he just wants his daddy to acknowledge he is a big boy and can think for himself.   Op's dad is doing what majority of parents around the world do, emotional blackmailing(pretty bad). Parents use this method only when they realize they have no other power over their child. OP is asking us strangers on how to deal with the man who loved and cared for him through out his life. Man, i'm a father too and that's just gut wrenching to think about. OP doesn't want to deal with the guilty and would blame himself if something were to happen to his father. I suspect OP would love to keep a healthy relationship with daddy-o aswell.

He didn't do this without a fight or an uprising and convinced a third of the other angels as well so they were cast down and so they effectively became demons as well.     Sure this sounds like an elaborate story, but why in the world would God make Satan as a djinn (which is under the Angels in 'coolness' apparently) made out of fire that I imagine would look not unlike Sauron in Lord of the Rings if he's such a main antagonist?  Also I think it was on here I believe that the concept of the djinn was already present in nearing Arabian mythology and culture so essentially Mohammed just mish mashed his own culture (which would essentially be considered pagan) to make his own ""2.0"" (technically 3.0).   To say that Judaism and Christianity are both acknowledged and he is there to only send the last message as a sort of continuation, he sure totally changed a core concept of the origin of the Angels & Satan and added his own culturally inspired 'science' or should I more aptly say, 'superstition-fiction'.

Many Western INFIDELS have been discoverers, inventors or prize-winning authors with goals to achieve in life.  An Arab muslim is usually a tipsy superstitious, certainly a degenerate and has definitely nothing to offer. Though some people spend time with them for a laugh, the Arab muslim assumes they are admirers.  Arab muslims are usually contradictory, deluded and with complexes gathered in a worthless mind. These people often verbally insult all that is rational and humane, and most of them do so just to attract attention and the curiosity of common people who laugh at the idiotic notions they hear.  Thomas Edison was an atheist who had successfully filed 1,093 patents for inventions before he eventually lightened the world with electricity. Albert Einstein produced the theory of relativity and Napoleon Bonaparte almost conquered the entire world. The Arab muslim, on the other hand, has never achieved anything and will eventually die from obesity or in a traffic accident.

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Arab atheists would be committing suicide. It would most probably be a gigantic burden on them due to the fact that their intelligence is not celebrated or even a non issue as it is in more developed countries and that they can't live their lives without being socially ostracized, shunned from not only society as a whole (knowing that they really can't fit in anymore because they asked the questions no one around them ever asked because they were afraid to find out) but even their family, friends and people who they hold dear all the while receiving no support or acknowledgement because their society and government is so stupid and they can't do anything but wait for their snail paced brains to catch up.

exmuslim,3cfwsw,CuriousBrownPython,9,Tue Jul 7 16:30:56 2015 UTC,"One of the major reasons that circumcision can lead to ED is because of keratinization. The glans (or head) of the penis is intended to be an internal organ, protected by the prepuce (foreskin). When the foreskin is removed, the head is completely exposed to the elements, including a constant rubbing against clothing. Over time, the skin thickens to protect the glans (much like a callous forms in areas of excessive friction). The head becomes dry and thick and is no longer supple and moist.   As men grow older, the thickened skin of the glans becomes less and less sensitive, which can cause men to have issues with erections. Sensitivity loss is also contributed to the circumcision itself, which removes the majority of the specialized nerve endings in the penis (over 20,000).    This is religion going too far. I can deal with Sharia, ISIS and the constant threat of execution ....BUT MESSING WITH MY PENIS? No way. I'm done. Religion must go."

exmuslim,3cfwsw,MohammedRidesAgain,5,Tue Jul 7 17:56:49 2015 UTC,You forget your history. Christianity terrorized Europe for centuries. Orthodox Jews are extreme traditionalists even today just like radical Islamists. The difference is that Christianity has largely lost its power in the west and orthodox Jews are a minority. History has shown us that there is just as much room for religious extremism in those religions that you deem passive as there is in Islam.
exmuslim,3cfwsw,unglad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:05:06 2015 UTC,"No, I know my history well, I am just honest about the difference between an expansionist ideology and a religion that has no form of government, no divinely prescribed methods of war and conquest, no example of perfection in the form of war and conquest and no claim to being the unaltered, final and eternal word of God.  The quality and extent of divine sanction in the cruelty of its actions are vastly different. Christianity is not good, but it is not as wicked as Islam.  Judaism is as bad, perhaps even worse, but it has few followers and serves as little more than ethnic/racial heritage for the vast majority of Jews.  You need to face the particular wickedness of Islam, not sink to relativism."
exmuslim,3cfwsw,MohammedRidesAgain,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with those points. But I wouldn't argue that modern Christianity (or any other peaceful religions that exist today) is passive and a great benefit to humanity. Humanity may have benefited from religion in the sense that early Christian monks were hugely involved in developing philosophy at the time, or the fact that it was Buddhist monks who developed meditation, but even the early Christian philosophers were severely constrained by their church and systematically persecuted for their philosophy whenever it was deemed to be in conflict with scripture. Christianity was simply the only game in town at the time. Religious institutions were the only places that offered that level of education. Religious persecution of this type is still present in the west today to an extent. They may have stopped burning witches and lynching people, but they lead a powerful anti-science movement that find justification for their ignorance in scripture. Now is that as bad as ISIS beheading Christian children? Of course not!

Trying to follow the link to the study itself just put me in a redirect loop, so I went directly to the International Journal of Men's Health website to trace it down.   It was easy to find, so I'll link it here with a piece of the abstract: Alexithymia and Circumcision Trauma: A Preliminary Investigation   Alexithymia in this population of adult men is statistically significant for having experienced circumcision trauma and for erectile dysfunction drug use.   No mention of keratinization. TheWholeNetwork's link on keratinization just takes me to The National Organization of Restoring Men's ""Lost List.""  Interestingly, the Journal published a critique of the previous study a year later: Claims That Circumcision Increases Alexithymia and Erectile Dysfunction Are Unfounded: A Critique of Bollinger and Van Howe’s “Alexithymia and Circumcision Trauma: A Preliminary Investigation”, but I guess that's not really relevant to TheWholeNetwork's interests.

Afterwards they started collecting charity donations to operate it. This started bringing in a lot of ‘revenue’. The ‘deobandi’ Muslims attacked the ‘barelvi’ Muslims and took control of the house of Allah (Mosque). Now they [deobandi] will collect the ‘revenue’.

Allah of all Gods is definitely not against testing things to see how it pans out. He revealed beta versions of Islam (Judaism and Christianity) to humanity only to update them with the final revelation of Islam 1.0. Which brings me to question 2.   I think the obvious answer is that if the God of the Quran was real, he wouldn't be so stupid. As a corolllary of this, I refer you to the Hitchens argument:   If Allah is omniscient why did he reveal imperfect religions to Abraham, Moses and Jesus? Why didn't God use his omniscience to be consistent in his revelations? Did he make a mistake?   Guess he messed up. He convinced over 2 billion people that Jesus is is his son and another 2 billion that Jesus could not possibly be his son ever. Apparently he has the power to easily correct this, but chooses not to.   We've all asked these questions when we started doubting Islam. What other questions occurred to you?

Most haven't read the Quran or looked into his history. It's quite simple: people believe what they're told. They don't investigate further. It's what we all do to some extent in varying domains.  For example: when my mother tells me stories from her childhood, I assume that's what happened. I don't ask her for dates, factual references and then go cross-check the story with the other people mentioned. I assume she told me something that's true in spirit even if the details aren't all there.  We also believe in things that are already consistent with what we believe. If someone tells me that my mum punched a kid in the face I'm less likely to believe it than if someone says that my mum gave money to charity.

exmuslim,3cd2fh,CadmeusCain,12,Tue Jul 7 15:08:18 2015 UTC,"So here's the thing: how you react to these narrations is highly dependent on the way you already see Muhammad. If you see Muhammad as the ultimate exemplar for all of humanity, the perfect example of truth, compassion and wisdom, you're going to find a lot in the Hadith that makes you uncomfortable. For example:   Muhammad had 9 wives at a time when he only permitted his followers to have 4. Muhammad married Aisha when she was six and she lived with him as a bride when she was 9. Muhammad had several people killed for writing poems to insult him: here, here and here   There are plenty of other things as well that I can't be bothered to find references for now but you can do the research yourself: for instance:   Muhammad broke the Iddat laws when he maried Safiyya bint Huyay after having her husband tortured to death He had an entire clan of Jews executed (men and boys) and the women sold into slavery for betraying him He had a sex slave named Mariya the Copt He revealed many dodgy Quranic revelations that benefited him and no one else (see Zaid and Zaynab incident) He had rival 'prophets' killed The Satanic Verses incident   If you see him as the perfect man, you're going to run into issues. If you see him as a political leader living in 600CE Arabia in the middle of desert full of warring and violent tribes, then Muhammad actually looks ahead of his time by comparison. In Muhammad's era it was normal for people to kill you for an insult, for pride and strength to be valued above all else, for the weak and orphaned to have no status in society and for women to be treated as property.   Muhammad actually advanced his culture by giving women some inheritance rights (when they had none before), encouraging people to look after the poor and orphans and to forgive some crimes against him. He was 100% a violent Arabian warlord, but he was more morally and ethically developed than the other warlords of his time. It's actually unprecedented that he captured Makkah with minimal bloodshed and forgave many of the enemies who had openly opposed him for years (including Hind, the woman who had his uncle murdered and then ate his liver). He certainly abused his power to get himself a harem of attractive women and to get his way, but what's really surprising is that the most powerful man in Arabia at the time chose to live in a hut outside a mosque when he could have easily had a palace and lived like a king.  .  So to answer your question:  ""Why was Muhammad unjust in the above Hadith"", it's because he was the leader of a tribe in 600CE Arabia. Justice systems were not as developed as they are now and tribal arbitrators would listen to a case and then decide the verdict based on their own assessment of the situation. It's not a great system; our current law systems are a vast improvement. One day in the future when they have even more advanced legal systems than ours they'll look at our society and wonder how the hell we let so many guilty men go free.  How you resolve these incidences depends again on your lens. Some people see Muhammad as a divine authority, righteous in everything and unable to be questioned; they'll need find some convoluted explanation for why Mo was actually right in this instance. Some people see Muhammad as an insane tyrant and they'll say it makes sense that he did something cruel and unjust. Others will just look at him as a product of his time and say: ""Yeah, guy was an ass a lot of the time""."

exmuslim,3cd2fh,exmoosetroubles,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:04:33 2015 UTC,"Thats a good point - study him. But what sources should you study? The Seerat was written more than 2 centuries after his death and commissioned by the ruling caliphate that needed to create a narrative that worked for their own goals. For example, the Miraj story was a complete late fabrication to show the Arab conquest had a claim to the land of Palestine and could compete with the Jews and Christians they encountered there.   The hadith had the same problem - with the added issue of people at the time actively creating and attributing stories to Mohammed for their own gain - completely fabricating the Isnads. Bukhari essentially whittled down from a collection of over 300k hadith to about 10k (thats like 3%...kind of staggering to see the numbers), classifying the rest as 1) Lies told for monetary gain and 2) Lies told for political or religious gain. You tell me what seems more plausible: a person writing 2 centuries after the events in question was rightly guided by god to find the correct hadith, or that this person was choosing based on his personal view of what a prophet of god should be... We're still no closer to the truth when someones accounts of history are mired in religious obligation."
exmuslim,3cd2fh,CadmeusCain,2,Tue Jul 7 14:04:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on almost all points. However, I think it is still possible to study the character of Muhammad. Whether or not Muhammad actually existed in this form is irrelevant. The point is that Muslims around the world believe that the version of Muhammad that appears in the Hadith and Biographies is the most perfect example of mankind. That version you can hold up to scrutiny.  It's like with Goku from Dragon Ball Z. Regardless of whether or not he is real, we can still discuss whether or not he is a good role model.  As for your points:   But what sources should you study? The Seerat was written more than 2 centuries after his death and commissioned by the ruling caliphate that needed to create a narrative that worked for their own goals. For example, the Miraj story was a complete late fabrication to show the Arab conquest had a claim to the land of Palestine and could compete with the Jews and Christians they encountered there.   We're in agreement here. The biographies are definitely a mess and also include things we know are BS. Besides the Miraj, there's also the early life of Muhammad wherein his heart was washed by an angel etc. That appears to also have been made up by the Caliphate. In many cases, we have the later biographies include more detail than the earlier ones showing clearly that people were adding to these histories.   The hadith had the same problem - with the added issue of people at the time actively creating and attributing stories to Mohammed for their own gain - completely fabricating the Isnads. Bukhari essentially whittled down from a collection of over 300k hadith to about 10k (thats like 3%...kind of staggering to see the numbers)   Bukhari is quoted as saying that he knew 100k Hadith that were authentic and 200k that were dubious. He chose to preserve about 7k of them. Meaning that we lost potentially 93k authentic Hadith (this doesn't even include the stuff that happened that never became Hadith). And even of his 7k there are unsatisfactory Hadith that have come under criticism from secular scholars.  There's also the circularity problem. Hadith scholars use Isnads (chains of transmission) to judge whether or not the Hadith were transmitted correctly. These Isnads are themselves oral narrations. Hadith scholars also use biographies of the people transmitting the Hadiths to determine whether or not these people can be trusted. This biographical data are also oral narrations. Essentially you have to use Hadith to validate Hadith which is circular reasoning. (Not to mention that the methodology is whack. How the f@#k can you expect to use a character study of a dead person to determine if the information they're providing is accurate?)  More recently: Ignaz Goldziher showed that much of the Hadith, even in authentic collections, are actually quotes from the Torah or Gospel or Rabbinic sayings (there's even a version of the Lord's Prayer in there).   We're still no closer to the truth when someones accounts of history are mired in religious obligation.   I agree. The Islamic histories are a huge problem area. Secular scholars like Montgomery Watt, Karen Armstrong, Martin Lings and Reza Aslan have written books analyzing the various historical documents but ultimately you are right: we have no idea how near or far we are to the truth.  Still: we can study this Muhammad guy. If he's the one held up to us as the perfect exemplar, he's the one we can knock down."

exmuslim,3cd2fh,CadmeusCain,2,Tue Jul 7 19:50:54 2015 UTC,"But what stories do we use to make that model? And does truth in that model matter?   Does it? Most Muslims don't seem to care. They've invented their own version of Muhammad that they're convinced is the real deal. Same with Jesus.   I say yes, as the claim is not just that he was a good role model, but was the prophet of god bringing down revelation, and everything he did was the perfect example for all mankind for all time.   I think these claims are easily debunked in so many other ways. The Quran for example. It contains so many errors, problems, contradictions and advances the silliest argument for its authority I've ever heard. I think it does a fair job of debunking this claim.   As for whether or not Muhammad was a prophet of God bringing revelation, literally THOUSANDS have made this identical claim from Zarathustra to Baha'ullah to Joseph Smith to the Oracles of Apollo. We have no reason to favour Muhammad over any of them. Surely if God had sent them, he would have done a better job of making sure we got the message loud and clear instead of bringing it to a bunch of illiterate desert dwelling Arabs in a language that would eventually die out and that was only spoken in ONE REGION and then expect it to get to the rest of mankind.   I don't know man...I guess I am trying to find truth in something that isn't really possible at this point - either through direct human invention and intervention, or just because theres that much time in between   This is a difficult one to swallow: you may have to become comfortable with uncertainty. It is very difficult, if not impossible for us to find out the 'truth' of what happened for the reasons we already discussed. We just don't truly know. It is still possible that Muhammad didn't exist, or that the entire history is mythic fiction based on a historical figure. The best supported argument is that the biographies are to some degree historical, but to what degree? We may never really be able to know. It was only ever transmitted orally by a mostly illiterate culture known for spinning stories and without much regard for historical accuracy. That's all we really have. We have no alternative but to make peace with that.   I've just recently finished reading through ""Why I am not a Muslim"" by Ibn Warraq   Never read it but have heard of Ibn Warraq. Is it any good?   You mentioned that your only reason for investigating this is to learn more about that time in history. What have you found to be the clearest picture?   As a born Muslim I have a vested interest in trying to understand the Muhammad and Islamic history and trying to make sense of it. I also find that the birth of Islam is one of the most interesting events in history for a number of reasons. Clearest picture? Heck I don't know. I enjoyed Islam: A Short History and Muhammad by Karen Armstrong. No God But God by Reza Aslan was also decent. I'm currently busy with Muhammad by Martin Lings (which I'm not so impressed by so far) and at some point I want to get Montgomery Watt's books Muhammad at Mecca and Muhammad at Medina (although I may have to settle for the abridged version: Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman).  I don't know if I do have a clearer picture. As I read different accounts, a picture certainly emerges. Can I call it a 'true' picture? I don't think so. Only a spectrum of possible interpretations of the facts we have. I like to think of it as a story. There is no definite meaning of Macbeth, only a spectrum of possible ways of interpreting the story. I see it the same way with the Muhammad story. I'm trying to engage with different intelligent interpretations and seeing which one makes the most sense to me while acknowledging that other interpretations exist.  Does this help? What aspects of it are you struggling with?"
exmuslim,3cd2fh,exmoosetroubles,2,Tue Jul 7 20:50:13 2015 UTC,"As a born Muslim I have a vested interest in trying to understand the Muhammad and Islamic history and trying to make sense of it.   I feel the same way. Even though I can say now that I don't believe in Islam,  I feel like I need to gain an understanding of what I was born into and what my family is still practicing.   My actual path out of religion was no longer believing the concept of god, not problems I had with the accounts of the prophet. Going into Islamic literature looking for some sort of proof of god was ultimately fruitless - everything just seemed like ways of making you feel guilty about even posing the question (how can you deny god's blessing, etc.) Thats why I think I've been particularly sceptical of people who take god as a given.  So my religious reading, apart from growing up muslim, started with Harun Yahya, that dude that was writing books about the miracles in the Quran and books about refuting evolution. I was taking an anthropology class, and having this new information from the mosque, I made a complete ass of myself trying to go against the system teaching us about evolution. The thing is, this course never covered evolution as a scientific topic. When in the next year I took biology, and they covered the actual Evolution through Natural Selection, I couldn't deny it anymore. Anyway...I read through the intro to seerat books in madrassa, but the first seerat I actually read from the source was Martin Lings, though by that point I knew enough of the major details from madrassa study that I felt it didn't add much to my understanding...  Lets pass about 8 years, and I try and read Reza Aslan's No God But God, and I can't get past the feeling of this person blaspheming on the character of the prophet's companions and Caliphs, so I stop reading half way...yes my friend, I was that muslim, lol.   After some personal issues and having to do a lot of growing up very quickly which was long overdue, I can't deny my thoughts that say the concept of god is all wrong...I read through Dawkins' God Delusion to prove to myself that my gut feeling, fleshed out, made sense. Started visiting /r/exmuslim and reading Hitchens' God is Not Great. At the same time, I searched out a translated (though heavily abridged) version of My Ordeal with the Quran by Abbas Abdul Noor, a book I mainly sought after to prove to myself that the Quran couldn't be all it was touted as being. And most recently, got introduced to Ibn Warraq, and I am blown away by his account. That the entire religious history of the prophet was an obvious forgery is mind boggling. Many a night were spent burning a j and contemplating the enormity of this con...   silliest argument for its authority   Do you mean the ""If it isn't real, make something identical to it""? Yeah, I've always had a problem with that, but just like every other doubt, you stuff it deep inside you and cover it with the flimsiest excuses and explanations when you're trying to be a good muslim.    It was only ever transmitted orally by a mostly illiterate culture known for spinning stories and without much regard for historical accuracy. That's all we really have. We have no alternative but to make peace with that.   I have to thank you for this part. I think this is where I was stuck - after having my mind blown open with the facts of the forgeries and secret histories, I was stuck between picking between either history without knowing how to connect the two to create a picture of reality. Making peace with uncertainly isn't something I was even thinking about, but I'm very glad you opened that door for me. Thank you."

Hitler and Stalin are now seen as devils. Ghandi and Mandela are now seen as angels. I'm not disputing that the first two did horrible things and the second two were mostly positive influences on their society. However, if you do the research you'll find that Hitler and Stalin had some redeeming qualities and that Ghandi and Mandela also have skeletons in their closet. People are complicated: it's a human tendency to simplify people as 'good' or  'bad' but most people are impossible to summarize to a single sentence or even a single book.  We also tend to judge the past by our own standards. We now think it's 'obvious' that slavery shouldn't be allowed but at the time there was much dispute as to whether or not that is true. Just like in the future it will be 'obvious' that gay people should have equal rights to marriage and society but right now it's an issue that society is in conflict over. Maybe one day people will look at us and say that we were monsters for killing animals to eat them while they munch on synthetically-produced beef.

It makes things much simpler to look at Muhammad as a product of his time and place instead of a and b mentioned above   This is where secular histories can help you out. Religious history is more concerned with sacredness, mythology and meaning. Secular historians go in and try to understand what happened, what were the prevailing cultures and attitudes and what were the various forces at play. It's a highly imprecise discipline, yet it sheds a lot of light on the past. There are many qualified historians that have studied Islamic-era Arabia in detail including William Montgomery Watt, Karen Armstrong, Reza Aslan, Martin Lings etc. I'm still getting through much of it myself. There's a lot to read and learn."

But their religiosity does not make their study invalid. I think it's important to be aware of the authors' biases whenever you read a study of any kind. This is why I suggest (and try) to read as widely as possible. If you've read any of these authors works you'll note that they do cite their sources and acknowledge the problems and criticisms of the time. You can usually follow up on these sources yourself if you're dissatisfied with their explanation (which is often the case with any social study)."

He also did some things that genuinely advanced the culture and that didn't actually benefit him. Like granting women inheritance rights, limiting the max number of wives (although he didn't follow this himself) and placing restrictions on wife beatings (but still allowing it). He also encouraged people to free slaves.  I don't think everything about Muhammad's life was cynical and sinister.

Your questions are ridiculous because:   You are assuming the woman intentionally lied about her attacker. Even today, modern eyewitness testimony (particularly from women in a rape situation) is notoriously unreliable. Not because people intentionally lie, but because in situations of intense stress, and subsequent interrogations/questioning, witnesses often make a mistake.  What more interrogation should Muhammad have done? The girl said the guy raped her. The guy obviously denied it, and the group of men who captured him sided with the girl. What else did the falsely accused man deserve? No harm became of him, his name was cleared, and the revered Prophet of God gave him his blessing. He wasn't languishing in jail for months/years, this entire episode seems to have been resolved in minutes.  How does this extremely weakly sourced story show, ""Muhammad had a messed up system of justice""?  7th century Arabia didn't exactly have access to cameras and DNA tests, and the issues he encountered are the same ones modern justice-systems struggle with today.

So given reality we only really have sensible options: Accept it, or don't accept it. And which of these two you pick comes down to you. Would you prefer to keep believing a fantasy, knowing now that it wasn't true? Or do you prefer not fooling yourself?  The thing is: back when you were a Muslim, you believed that there was an afterlife. That does not make it true that there was one. What you lost was not something concrete, but a fantasy. It's like waking up from a wonderful dream and realizing that it never happened (this happened to me two nights ago). We feel a sense of loss because we would have liked that dream to have been true (in my dream I got box sets of all the books I wanted for dirt cheap), but we haven't lost anything that existed in reality.  It is difficult. Reality forces us to confront many things we may not like, or may not want to like. Some things we're able to change and others we aren't.

For some people this just means trying to have a nice life, for others it means making the world a better place. There is no wrong answer since it's all subjective, meaning we assign meaning from our own perspective.  As an atheist, the lack of an afterlife sucks. But death and life are mutually exclusive, so I will never experience death because by then my life has ended.  As I get older loss is much worse than death, because I know I will never see these people again."

Its expressing itself as human through you for just awhile. :)  You aren't going anywhere when you ""die,"" you have always been here and always will be. You just won't be the little 'you' that you identify with right now anymore.   Life is like exploring a big dark cave with a few matches. You won't get to see or understand everything, but you shouldn't be afraid and go see what you can."
exmuslim,3cenuz,AModernPilgrim,3,Tue Jul 7 17:58:53 2015 UTC,"Hey relax. No one knows for sure what happens after death, it’s a massive mystery as is life itself. Even consciousness and that subjective experience we all have is still a massive mystery. No one has all the answers.   I’ve seen some pretty incredible interviews from people who had near death experiences and saw themselves hovering above their own body and heard what was being said in the hospital waiting room, what’s amazing is all these experiences are so similar. Does it prove anything? Nope, but it’s fascinating, at least I find it so.  I mean think about it, at the core of everything all you have is electrons, protons, and various other subatomic particles, but in you and I these particles are arranged in such a way that they have become aware they exist. It’s mind boggling. I just feel like there is something incredible behind all this, something perhaps more than what we could ever imagine."
exmuslim,3cenuz,BlckHawks2015,2,Tue Jul 7 15:23:32 2015 UTC,"I only miss the part about being reunited with loved ones. That was such a comfort to me. When I see parents who have lost their kids, I break down at the thought they will never see the child again."
exmuslim,3cenuz,pkta,2,Tue Jul 7 15:39:52 2015 UTC,"What happens to us after death? Yes, I struggled with this one when I was leaving the faith. I too would like to believe that we go to this magical place forever but I as I grew older- the Islamic view of heaven became less appealing. It sounded so static and 2 dimensional to me. Plus I don't wanna meet any moose in the afterlife. Haha. Now I believe when we go it's like going into deep sleep. Nice and warm and dreamless. But this only applies to me, because I think I've been pretty privileged compared to most of the worlds population. But when I think of the people who lived thru wars, poverty, murders, rapes and all other unimaginable heartache and cruelty, I want to believe in death we all get the gift of forgetting our lives and who we were on earth."
exmuslim,3cenuz,KisahMelati,2,Tue Jul 7 16:00:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly this!  As a kid, a magical place where everything is just wonderful, did sound interesting. But now that I think of it, the idea of heaven is just very very ordinary. A river of milk and the sweetest of the fruits, amazing food, amazing women. Safe. Anything else ? I mean, I don't even like milk. And we are not running short of amazing food, women or natural beauty in this life as well. Well, heaven is not a winner. It just goes to show how unimaginative mo was."

Forever is a very very long time. Whatever great things you can come up with to do they are bound to grow stale after a few years,... let alone a few billion years. Let alone if all you get to do is praising the Great Leader. Hitchens said it best, it would be worse that North Korea, at least there you could kill yourself to make it all stop.  The other thing is hope, dreams, desires, wishes, the sense of wonder and yes fears, hates are what makes me me. Whoever would be sitting there for all eternity without all those emotions, wound't really be me."
exmuslim,3cenuz,Molotova,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:00:15 2015 UTC,"Conciousness is a hard thing comprehend. Some people think its an emergent entity from the interplay of the cells that make up our body, though there isn't any real concrete explanation yet in that regard.  There are people who study and explore consciousness though... And how do you test and study something? You perturb it, and see its reaction. In that realm, natural psychoactive substances are the best way to do that.   Have you heard of Terence McKenna? Since death was the subject we're on right now, I'll just leave this here."
exmuslim,3cenuz,exmoosetroubles,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:36:31 2015 UTC,"Personally, even when I was a Muslim, I didn't get the idea of an afterlife. What's the meaning or objective of doing sex forever? I will get very bored! Also, a life without struggles, happy and sad moments, achievements and goals can't be called a life. That's why I always said that if there is an afterlife, I'd chose hell."
exmuslim,3cenuz,GeekEmad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:56:38 2015 UTC,I feel like eventually we would reach such a conclusion in the afterlife as well. The human experience is temporary so have prioritize our time. If time is infinite I feel that eventually we'd run out of things to do and all the emotions and experiences we dreamed of would be fulfilled  over and over again and nothing would be special anymore.

Where will I be when I exit this world? I wont be anywhere. I won't exist. No me.. Just like before.  We are not the centre of the universe... Nothing is about us. We just happen to be here because the conditions were right and life grew. Just like when you leave a sandwich out.. Mold will grow. The molds purpose?... To fuck shit up. Ruin what it's been allowed to take over.  We are of course much more intelligent than mold. So it makes it harder to accept our only purpose is to spread like mold.

Initially the German Emperor Otho II , who had set up his headquarters in Rome, successfully defeated these Saracen forces   977 – Sergius, Archbishop of Damascus, expelled from his See by Muslims   982 – Emperor Otho’s forces ambushed and his army defeated   1003 – Muslims from Spain sack Antibes   1003-09 – Marauding bands of Saracens plunder Italian coast from Pisa to Rome from bases on Sardinia   1005 – Muslims from Spain sack Pisa   1009 – Caliph of Egypt orders destruction of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, the Tomb of Jesus   1010 – Saracens seize Cosenza in southern Italy   1015 – All Sardinia falls   1016 – Muslims from Spain again sack Pisa   1017 – Fleets of Pisa and Genoa sail for Sardinia, find Saracens crucifying Christians, drive Saracen leader out. Saracens try to re-take Sardinia until 1050   1020 – Muslims from Spain sack Narbonne   1095 – The First Crusade   So Muslims been pretty much asking to be slaughtered for 400 years testing angelic patience (compared to that of Moslems) until they finally got it, the first Crusade in history. Also, yeah, there're Arabs, who disbelieve in Islam, but don't want to embrace Atheism, so they convert to Christianity. What's the big deal? It's not like Arab Christians gonna ride an aircraft into the skyscraper with warcries of ""Ar-Rabba wa Yasu al-Massih athim!"".

Thereupon Ubaydullah said: The company of Muhammad (peace be upon him) is a honour for you, not a disgrace. He added: I called for you to ask about the reservoir.

Fasting is putting nothing in your mouth (eating and drinking are obvious, but you also can't brush your teeth or chew gum) from the when the first rays of light come up to when the first rays of light come down. Where I live this is about 3:30 am to 8:30 pm. Most people just sleep during this, but that's not what fasting is all about. If you do fasting the proper way, you also pray 5 times a day (which you should already be doing), read Qur'an a bunch, and also refrain from sex, anger, violence, music, and really anything else that's a temptation, but nobody actually does because Muslims tend to pick and choose what they want.

What they do do healthily is end the fast - they don't stuff themselves as soon as the sun goes down on the day of Yom Kippur (the Jewish day, much like the Muslim day, is from sunset to sunset, rather than midnight), and they don't eat iftar food. They eat salads and sweetened tea at first. Then pasta and bakes in general."

exmuslim,3casr2,CadmeusCain,4,Tue Jul 7 03:05:50 2015 UTC,"I think your issue is more with religious stupidity and blindness than fasting.  Fasting can have health benefits. I remember speaking to a few doctors back in the day and doing some previous research. It's not as miraculous as advertised, but there are benefits to periods of starvation over a prolonged time. It helps the body regulate metabolism and fat deposits. That being said: it is harmful for some people, it is harmful when you aren't already in good health (e.g. old, child, diabetic etc.) and/or if you don't eat well during downtime. I'll post some links later when I try to find some.  On the other hand: I completely sympathize. You sound extraordinarily frustrated that your mother is being unreasonable and won't listen to you. If it wasn't fasting, it would be something else. This kind of thinking can lead people to serious self-inflicted harm. And it gets even more frustrating when they won't listen to other sensible people because they have some warped conviction that they're doing the right thing. This is probably one of the most dangerous things about religion in general."

exmuslim,3casr2,bigbadjesus,3,Mon Jul 6 15:38:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah a lot of people assume Muslims (majority) eat like monks when they break or before they start fasting. WE GORGE ON FOOD.

exmuslim,3cbltr,BobTheJoeBob,6,Mon Jul 6 18:27:13 2015 UTC,"There is no evidence for Moses and no evidence for the Exodus or enslavement of Jews. In fact, there's evidence against the latter.   Jesus has some sources saying he existed, but they're after his death.   Muhammad likewise has no contemporary sources like Jesus but later evidence suggests he probably did exist. More evidence than Jesus anyway."
exmuslim,3cbltr,utnahpishtim,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:41:35 2015 UTC,The evidence for Mohammed's existence as a man (not as a prophet) is within a decade of his life. The prophetic proclamations are 60-100 years later.  For Jesus those timescales are stretched out further (first mention itself being 50-100 years later) plus the initial mentions like Josephus may be forgeries.
exmuslim,3cbltr,mudgod2,9,Tue Jul 7 06:05:38 2015 UTC,"Almost none of the early characters in the Old Testament likely existed. With regard to Moses, we know that much of the myths about him are similar to the ones about Hammurabi. Furthermore, as you've already said, there is no evidence of an Exodus, no evidence that the Jews were ever in Egypt or that they ever were in Sinai.  Everyone before Moses (Abraham, Lot etc.) is likely fictional. For people after Moses, it seems likely that David and Solomon are based on legends, although there was a pot discovered that bears David's name (not evidence that David existed though). Some of the later persons in the Old Testament, such as Hezekiah and Ezekiel are likely to have exhausted in some capacity.  When it comes to Jesus, historians go both ways. Most will say that there was a Rabbi named Jesus and that he was crucified. That's pretty much all we know. The rest of the story are likely myths built around this person and his teachings and are likely the works of later editors and storytellers. The historical person of Jesus is mostly lost in the myth.  When we get to Muhammad, the historical evidence is stronger. He is mentioned by name in the constitution of Medina and is mentioned in some contemporary accounts by countries other than Arabia. But again, much of Muhammad's history is the product of mythology. The earliest biography of Muhammad by Ibn Ishaq dates to earlier than 100 years after his death but has since been lost and only exists in the notes by his student Ibn Hisham. The majority of the Hadith and biographies date to around 200-300 years after Muhammad's death.   In the case of Muhammad we know that there are thousands of forged hadith (some even in the Sahih collections) that are actually quotes from the Torah, from other Rabbis and other historical documents that are mis-attributed to Muhammad. Likely the whole story of the Night Journey (Miraaj) and the early stories of Muhammad's childhood are fictional and written much later by editors trying to flesh out his background. So in the character of Muhammad there is much difference in opinion. Some will argue that the incredible body of Hadith and Biography (Tabari's history is 10,000 pages) suggests that Muhammad did exist and that we actually know quite a lot about him that is well-attested by multiple sources, even if much of it is dodgy. On the other end, many will say that the historical figure is lost in 200 years of mythology and editing. Some fringe scholars even suggest that the whole story of Muhammad was made up 200 years after the fact to account for the sudden rise of Islam (there isn't much empirical support for this).  So in a nutshell:   Most Old Testament characters have no evidence that they existed Some later Old Testament characters are historical figures which we know little about Of Jesus there is evidence of him being a Rabbi that was crucified. Everything else is likely myth. He may not have existed. Of Muhammad there is strong evidence that he existed as a historical person. There are tons of historical accounts of him including extensive biographies and narrations from various sources. It is hard to determine how much is myth and how much is fact. It is possible (but unlikely) that he did not exist."

exmuslim,3cbltr,hunther,2,Tue Jul 7 06:41:17 2015 UTC,"You'll have to ask the historians who argue that Muhammad did not exist. The argument goes that he was invented as a fiction by the early Islamic empires in the same way that the Jews in exile invented Abraham and Moses. If that were the case it would be easy to point to a tomb and say: ""that's where Muhammad was buried"". There's no way to test the corpse empirically to check if the person is, in fact Muhammad. We have no dental records or DNA samples to cross check it with. An analogous example is the infamous Shroud of Turin which is supposedly the burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth. It bears the imprint of a crucified person consistent with the Gospel accounts and the facial features match common depictions of Jesus. One could ask ""whose shroud is ir if not Jesus?"". Turns out it's a medieval forgery. Check Wikipedia.  Back to the Muhammad thing: the idea that Muhammad didn't existed is admittedly possible given the current body of evidence, but that doesn't mean it's likely. There is much stronger evidence and explanation that Muhammad was, to some degree, a historical person."

exmuslim,3ca8b7,supaphreek,17,Mon Jul 6 20:16:37 2015 UTC,"your dad's argument is Pascal's wager.  There are an infinite potential risks to consider. Not just the risks according to Islam. There is a small chance that god punishes people who pray and it is safer not to pray. If you think it is ridiculous to consider this possibility I raised, then it should be equally easy for you to dismiss the possibility that Islam raises, or that Christianity raises, or any other baseless claims about the afterlife.   There are so many problems with Pascal's wager. When applied in an Islamic context as your dad has done, the problems are even worse. A person fasting and praying, but not really believing, is a hypocrite.  Allah is not a big fan of hypocrites, and they are punished even more harshly than a regular kafir.  What you really need is a reason to believe, and Pascal's wager doesn't even attempt to offer one. It merely argues, in a self defeating way, that it is safer to believe.  Pascal was arguing that it's safer to believe in christianity. If Islam is true, then Pascals wager in it's original form is arguing in favour of shirk. Reducing your risk from the perspective of one religion, could increase your risk from the perspective of another. There are millions of mutually exclusive religions, and there is no way to even work out what would be safer, even if you thought that playing it safe, rather than going by evidence, was a good idea.  http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=Pascal%27s_Wager"
exmuslim,3ca8b7,fishfhead,3,Mon Jul 6 10:06:30 2015 UTC,"Yes... Another problem in the father's argument: Islam doesn't guarantee paradise because no one knows how Allah decides. Even Mo himself wasn't sure (Quran 46). Using the same logic, I'd say Christianity is actually a much better bet because if it's true, you are guaranteed salvation, but if it's false, you have the least relative potential loss. *Note: I don't believe we should choose religion this way. If God is real, He should be capable of revealing Himself clearly to those who seek genuinely."

I used to encourage her to read salaah etc...Due to a number of factors I had started slipping over time and she noticed.   If i am a Non muslim our islamic marriage is annulled and she does not want that, so therefore I have to be a muslim.   We live in a predominatly muslim society here in the south of africa, as such its not in my or my kids best interest if i come out and state that Mo was a normal Man and the Big cheese in the sky is the stuff of ledgend.

Then you have to factor in all other religions that believe in god and some kind of afterlife, but the Quran doesn't consider them among AhulKitab like the Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Bahai's, but instead they are considered Mushriks.   If Islam were true then at least 40 percent of the World would be Muslims, but instead they are only half of that. So 1.5 billion people are guaranteed heaven and the rest are going to hell?

In addition, I would like to add that ""...if however there is no afterlife and no God, you haven't lost anything"" is often not true in practice, especially in Islam where there is a lot of investment involved. You need to spend a cumulative one hour at least on prayers everyday, then there's monetary investments such as alms, and of course there's also a number of things you unnecessary lose out on such as eating during the day on Ramadhan, when there's no benefit whatsoever to avoid them deliberately. So by attempting to take the safer route, you have the possibility of losing out even more. Not worth it for the sake of 'maybe' if you ask me."

Also, even from an Islamic point of view, the first tenant is belief not action.

Pascal's Wager is one of the oldest tricks in the book, and one of the lamest arguments ever. The gist is that, in terms of payoff, it makes sense to worship God. But there are so many untrue assumptions embedded in this.  The obvious one is that Pascal imagines a false dichotomy: God or no God, Reward or Punishment. The obvious question is which God? What if you worship Jesus but Zeus was the right one? Or you worshiped Krsna but Horus was the true God? Wouldn't worshiping Allah and denouncing all other Gods as false make Odin really angry?   There are thousands or religions with thousands of God claims. To be consistent you have to evaluate all of them. Even if you only focus on the Abrahamic religions, worshiping Jesus is Shirk worship in Islam, but worshiping Allah and denying Jesus means you lose salvation in Christianity.

I have bold-ed the parts of the court's opinion that I could immediately relate to from having lived in Pakistan.

exmuslim,3ca23c,Dayandnight95,3,Mon Jul 6 08:19:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not an ex-Muslim, and I think it's primitive to generalize Muslims and spread hate against Muslims. It's ok to hate Muslims who hate other people, Muslims who want apostates to get punished, Muslims who support stoning women to death, Muslims who marry off their daughters against their will, Muslims who force their daughters to wear veils, Muslims who beat their children for prayer/ramadan, etc. But not all Muslims do that.   Generally you should hate the mental sickness (Islam), not the mentally sick person (Muslim).  Anyway, let's replace the word kuffar in the Quran with ""Muslims"" and see what happens:   ""Muslims are the vilest animals""  ""Show mercy to one another, but be ruthless towards Muslims""  ""How perverse are the Muslims""  ""Strike off the heads of Muslims as well as their fingertips""  ""Fight those Muslims who are near you""  ""Muslim mischief makers should be murdered or crucified""   Sure, it's out of context. Let's put it into context: Of course it means the ISIS-Muslims (who are very devout Muslims indeed). But for the sake of saving some letters, we simply call them Muslims.  If you think a book which spreads hate speech against kuffar is the best book ever, then you're not exactly in the position to complain about hate speech against you."

The same goes with any group. General hate can never be a good thing because the good people in the  ""hated"" group are not given a chance to come out of it or realize the error of the group, if they are in error that is.

That's a perfectly valid and true criticism.  If you apply it to specifically Western situated populations, they are worse than the average for other Western populations and they are more violent, obnoxious and unwelcome (nowadays).   Get out of our country stupid muslims.   Yeah, some people are going to tell you to get out of their country, sadly, that is the natural outcome of Muslim provocation and delusions. For all other immigrant populations, it might be best if Muslims were gotten rid of, in the West.   Muslims need to all die.  Burn them all alive.   I'd take that as the hyperbole it is, but if you want to feel that this is threatening and unduly hostile, I'd point to the fact that I have seen hundreds of Muslims marching down Bethnal Green, in the cause of the Caliphate, and they are a far more credible threat to my existence given my unbelief.  There are many idiot Muslims, they've infected our peoples and most of us do want rid of them. Me I favour shaming, isolating and critiquing them, as I believe that adherence to Islam will fade away once social acceptance and regard are removed from it."

exmuslim,3c8yvf,SurfingTheCosmos,2,Mon Jul 6 04:26:05 2015 UTC,"According to a recent Pew report on the future of world religions:   In the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East and North Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean, the projected Muslim share of the population in 2050 is about the same whether or not religious switching is taken into account in the population projections.  Religious switching only marginally changes the projected Muslim share of the population in North America, where the Muslim population is expected to be 0.2% smaller when religious switching is included in the projection scenario. This means that a small net loss of Muslims is occurring in North America through religious switching.  Meanwhile, net gains of Muslims through religious switching appear to be happening in sub-Saharan Africa and Europe. But again, they are not anticipated to significantly change the projected Muslim populations in these regions.   And, as you can see from this image, it's estimated that in the next 40 years the number of people who will join Islam will be almost equal to the number of people who leave it, resulting in only a marginal net gain in adherents. It should be remembered though that this is an estimation, as the report says:   This report describes how the global religious landscape would change if current demographic trends continue. With each passing year, however, there is a chance that unforeseen events – war, famine, disease, technological innovation, political upheaval, etc. – will alter the size of one religious group or another...It bears repeating that many factors could alter these trajectories. For example, if a large share of China’s population were to switch to Christianity (as discussed in this sidebar), that shift alone could bolster Christianity’s current position as the world’s most populous religion. Or if disaffiliation were to become common in countries with large Muslim populations – as it is now in some countries with large Christian populations – that trend could slow or reverse the increase in Muslim numbers."

I basically became famous among my friends for great parties. I had a lot of crazy moments but the two that stuck out the most would have to be the time it was 2 am. My house has over 60 people in it and we just ran out of alcohol after doing a second run already and then I see 5 cars pull up with about 20 people total. I was already exhausted and I was not gonna spend more money on another beer run so I told them to get back in their cars and that the party is over. Then I kicked everyone out who wasn't a close friend and passed out.   The second one would have to be the time these two girls tried to have a 3some with me but I had a girlfriend at the time. They kept offering me drinks and I didn't decline. At this point I drink so much it becomes a blur and I wake up and get ready for work. I feet up. Get clothed and head it the door. This is when I realize I forgot my keys. Then I turn around and see one of the girls in my bed. I apparently ended up sleeping with her. I felt really terrible and I told my girlfriend on the spot. She ended up forgiving me after giving me hell for a while.
exmuslim,3ca52z,lacedup_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:27:42 2015 UTC,Oh wow haha. Your girlfriend is a very forgiving person.. No judgement but if I were in her position I wouldn't have forgiven you! :-P You better have been super nice to her after that! Gifts erry day m9
exmuslim,3ca52z,Kamikazeoda,3,Tue Jul 7 04:50:39 2015 UTC,I live at home and my parents don't know I'm an exmuslim or that I've been in a relationship for 2 years.  Told my parents I was sleeping at my friends house and instead i went to my boyfriends for a couple of days. I went to a club for the first time that night with him and another friend.  And I got drunk... Real drunk ... It was fun in the club until you get out and realise how dizzy you are. (And how often you need to pee).  Woke up at around 4 am vomiting vodka raspberries and continued to vomit all day the next day. Safe to say I'm extremely thankful I stayed at his house for 2 nights.  Me and alcohol clearly don't work together and I'll be perfectly happy if I don't have it again haha. (Also alcohol tastes gross)  But weed ... That's a different story. I've been smoking in the backyard this Ramadan after everyone is asleep. It's so risky but once I'm back in the house and safe in my room from getting caught it's so much fun.  Alcohol 👎  Weed 👍

exmuslim,3ca52z,keyed_yourcar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:53:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've trained my parents well :p  I know I put that in a way that sounds bad but I did have to make them become less investigative.  I did this by always seeming transparent. Always putting tabs on myself by texting my mum and telling her where I am throughout the day. Even if it's down the road to the shops. Did it for years to build that kind of trust. (I'm an expert liar)  Then after building that foundation, I began telling my mum I was hanging out, instead of asking her.  And if she ever gets investigative I always have a million back up things to say.  She wouldn't dare investigate the truth tbh. She's too scared. If she came up to me and tried to figure things out id gladly tell her. Oh well. I'm scared to tell the truth too, can't blame her if she is too. Also the only reason I was allowed to sleep at that friends house is because her family is really religious and her parents were overseas at the time. My dad wouldn't let me be there if her dad or any other men were there. (Again...I built up a foundation of trust for years)"
exmuslim,3ca52z,Kamikazeoda,2,Wed Jul 8 18:17:50 2015 UTC,First time I got really bad I was DJ'ing at a friends house party. Drank nearly half a litre of vodka (straight). It was great fun taking requests and plenty of conversation all night. Not so fun when I ended up puking all over the garden and in the kitchen sink!   Second time was in a club. Jager  bomb after Jager bomb I got so drunk. Some guy blindside punched me and accused me of stealing his wallet (I hadn't seen the guy ever before this). Being so drunk I couldn't defend myself even though my friends diffused the situation. He was thrown out and my friends and I were asked to leave so that things wouldn't escalate.   Since then I don't drink to excess. I occasionally hit bars and clubs but drink just enough to get a buzz. I enjoy it a lot more that way and still have the capability to score a takedown if things get a little heated.
exmuslim,3ca52z,Kamikazeoda,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:53:52 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah throwing up is the worst part of getting drunk I reckon! Worse than the hangover imo.

exmuslim,3c824l,CornPlanter,13,Sun Jul 5 19:57:55 2015 UTC,"I cant speak for everyone, but I can offer some insight into my mindset when I was a muslim. I remember wondering about how birds in large flocks fly in concert so precisely. I remember mentioning it to my parents, and their first reaction was basically ""Allah tells them what to do."" For whatever reason, that wasn't a satisfactory answer for me, so I looked into it some more. When I told them what I had learned, they said, ""sure, that is the natural explanation, but Allah still set the laws and rules and determined their behaviour.""   So I think theres two types of muslims. The first type will answer with ""its Allah"" and the second type will answer ""its because of xyz natural phenomenon, which is ultimately controlled by Allah."" I imagine this is true for people in most belief systems. Ex. ""its Jesus duh!"" vs ""Jesus might be the ultimate cause but it happens because of this physical reason."""

I imagine this is true for people in most belief systems. Ex. ""its Jesus duh!"" vs ""Jesus might be the ultimate cause but it happens because of this physical reason.""   Sounds like the same type of reasoning used by a certain Isaac Newton. Newton was unable to prove his hypothesis of how 'gravity worked' because it was largely faith based and drew on his Arian convictions . He had concluded, 'God does not himself control the gravitational forces that keep the planet in motion, nor does he provide directly the medium via which universal gravitation operates. Instead the incorporeal ether which facilitates the phenomenon of gravitation (and perhaps other forces) is actually the body or spiritual form of Jesus Christ'. He believed that Christ was a mediator for all action in the universe, the intermediary via which the system of the universe was maintained, God's 'commander-in-chief', his viceroy."

Within the corpus of Islamic sources there is nothing whatsoever that contradicts microevolution. Evolution on a larger scale from one type of species to another (excluding humans) as in macroevolution, is equally acceptable and justifiable as per Islamic sources. According to Islam, the only exception that is made is the creation of mankind. Humans are not viewed as being part of the whole evolutionary scheme, but rather being a unique and honored creation of Allah. [Quran 17:70, 38:75]. From an Islamic perspective, everything takes place according to Allah's will and permission and as predestined by Him alone. [Quran 54:49] In light of this, the concept of natural selection is not always accepted in Islam. Many scholars believe in a Theistic Human Evolution set in action by Allah, in which Allah guided humanity through their believed phases of evolution, thereby allowing a compliance between human evolution and Islam.""

Maybe crazy Imams try and suppress science progress in some isolated areas, or some extremely crazy Muslims like Taliban supress it in all areas, but generally, Islam does not seem to be incompatible with science. And never was. Yes it may be incompatible with science in some theoretical, philosophical, strictly formal logic way, but not in a practical way.

exmuslim,3c824l,CornPlanter,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:32:50 2015 UTC,"Just because practically people can do science, that does not mean that Islam as an entity is compatible with science. Cognitive dissonance is a real thing; strict Muslims can do science and truly believe that it works, while at the same time upholding the Ashari opinion regarding everything in nature having properties only through God, and there being no secondary causes. I'm quite aware of scientific discoveries made by Muslims - again, that proves absolutely nothing regarding the compatibility of Islam itself with science."

If you can really show me that Islam is against scientific reasoning I'll leave it, but I was always taught that Islam encourages reasoning and education so I would be surprised to learn otherwise."
exmuslim,3c824l,SlidyBat,4,Sun Jul 5 23:20:40 2015 UTC,"Islam does not encourage asking questions.   [5:101] ""O ye who believe! Ask not of things which, if they were made unto you, would trouble you; but if ye ask of them when the Qur'an is being revealed, they will be made known unto you. Allah pardoneth this, for Allah is Forgiving, Clement.""  Islam means submission. And I am pretty sure you are rational enough to understand that submission requires No Questioning. Submissive is to Obey. Not ask WHY, WHAT OR HOW. So, God created earth and heavens and birds and flowers and honey. Great. How? God just did. Praise to be God.  It does command to read though. [96:1] ""Read: In the name of thy Lord Who createth,""  And please don't reply with 'But where does it say no scientific reasoning is allowed'. Because then, you will be cherry picking. When God says something, it means what it says. We, humans should not put words in God's mouth."

Ask not of things which, if they were made unto you, would trouble you; but if ye ask of them when the Qur'an is being revealed, they will be made known unto you. Allah pardoneth this, for Allah is Forgiving, Clement.""   This seems to have nothing to do with science, the first analysis I found is ""This verse prohibits the Muslims from asking about things they have no benefit in asking about, because if such matters appear to them it may be harmful to them and it will be difficult for them to hear it, like the person who asked the Prophet  sallallaahu  alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allaah exalt his mention ): ‘‘Where is my father (in the Hereafter)? The Prophet  sallallaahualayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allaah exalt his mention ) replied: ‘‘In Hellfire.’’, or the person who asked about Hajj: ‘‘Is it every year, o Prophet of Allaah?’’, whereupon the Prophet  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allaah exalt his mention ) replied: ‘‘No, and if I replied by ‘yes’, it would become an obligation on you to perform it every year and you will not be able to do so""  So it seems to me like you took that verse completely out of context.   Islam means submission.   Yes, I am an Arabic speaker.   And I am pretty sure you are rational enough to understand that submission requires No Questioning.    The Prophet (pbuh)  was asked hundreds of questions and he did his very best to answer them, what do you think Hadith is?    Not ask WHY, WHAT OR HOW. So, God created earth and heavens and birds and flowers and honey. Great. How? God just did. Praise to be God.   Show me an example where the Prophet banned, or at the very least discouraged science. I'm not interested in reasoning, where is the empirical evidence? Even Saudi Arabia encourages it's people to have an education, women included.   And please don't reply with 'But where does it say no scientific reasoning is allowed'. Because then, you will be cherry picking.   Am I not allowed to ask for evidence? Am I to blindly accept what you're telling me without questioning it? How is that cherry picking? Prove that either:   The Prophet discouraged questioning natural phenomenon or secondary causes   or   The Quran bars scientific questioning    When God says something, it means what it says. We, humans should not put words in God's mouth.   But that's exactly what you're doing. I'm asking you to show me where God has said no to science and you're giving me nonsensical pseudo-reasoning.

I also gave two links on Islamic scholars, not just philosophers, saying that Islam encourages scientific thinking WITH sources from the Quran and Hadith, so i completely blew your cherry picked article out of the water, but apparently I'm the one who ran away.

And yet, despite all this, there are educated, intelligent people denying this is happening. If I were trying to prove that scientists were against science, I could cherry pick the ones that deny global warming, and of course you would show the overwhelming majority that fully support its existence. And that is what I have done, I have shown you others that say science is fully supported by Islam.   Anyone can have a valid understanding, YOU do not have a monopoly on interpretation.   Do you not think I know that? Would I bother arguing if I thought my 'interpretation' was the only valid one? All you're doing is strawmanning me while ignoring anything I have said, because while I am honestly trying to get at the truth you could not give less of a shit.  Edit: maybe I'm giving you too little credit; perhaps you don't understand that I'm arguing against half a dozen people at the same time and if I don't respond to a point you made it is because I have responded elsewhere.

Considering the argument above that you made, and the absolutist claims about Islam you're making.   Islam encourages science in your version of the faith? good for you. There's plenty of Muslims out there, like some salafi's, who think differently and cite scripture.

One thing I notice with Muslims is that they always do the running away thing and never come back. This is actually a very good point. You should either ask other Muslims or people from r/Islam to refute this point or get an  Islamic expert. They always tear down the straw man's or are educated enough to argue past a couple statements with their defenses but they never can say much against good statements like these. Especially when the book and the prophet are infallible. Pointing out one infallibility deems the whole book and the movement useless.

In the case of Muslims, if a child asks them why hurricanes form and they don't know the scientific reason, they would recall what they read in the Quran and hadith about how the angel Mikaeel is in control of rainfall and how Allah often punishes nations with natural disasters. To them this is 100% factual information and see no problem with passing this on as the answer to child's question. To them, why say 'I don't know' and google it to find a more scientific answer when they do in fact know that the Quran is the word of god and there is nothing better."
exmuslim,3c824l,Vallentain,-1,Mon Jul 6 00:59:14 2015 UTC,"People hate admitting they don't know the answer to something, and if at all possible tend to latch on to anything resembling the truth.   It's hardly exceptional to Islam or religious people. My favourite example is gravity. People feel clever when they can say ""things fall down because of gravity"". But they have no slightest idea what that gravity is. It's just a scientific sounding word they had read in some textbook. ""Things fall down because of gravity"" is no different than ""things fall down because Allah made it so"". I am not talking about scientists or people with good physics knowledge, to them gravity is not an empty word of course. But for the masses, the laymen, it's no better explanation than Allah.  On the other hand, belief in god was always a good motive to learn more about the world, to learn how god created it, how exactly god made the birds to fly. Not to everyone, obviously. But people did try to learn more about the world to get closer to god. Early history of both Islam and Christianity attests to that. I think people who are naturally inquisitive, who want to learn, they do it despite being raised as Muslims, Christians, Buddhists or non-believers. Likewise people who are not, they won't become scientific minded just because they are non-believers.   Being (non) religious can influence your wish to learn more about the world, one way or another, and Islam in it's current state is far from being patron of sciences, but I think the issue is very far from simplistic black and white depiction in this comic."

Thankfully she doesn't believe in forcing religion, even though she's more religious! She's not opposed to gay marriage! (she does say it's unnatural), but doesn't mind them marrying :)  She then proceeded to ask me if I'm gay. I really felt safe about saying yes, but I said no, since I'm not gay.  I feel like I'm ""wasting acceptance"" by being a white cis straight male... I'd be just fine over here if I was a black tranny lesbian. I don't know how, and I know I shouldn't, but I feel guilty for ""wasting acceptance""."

I'm not too fond of the idea of marriage in general, I think a couple should be able to trust each other enough to not need a legal contract.

exmuslim,3c7xj3,_Lezbro_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:25:44 2015 UTC,"Well yeah of course there are legal benefits. The Australian law, while not allowing same sex marriage (yet), does allow same sex couples a de-facto union, which is not marriage, it's just that couples that live together for a long time get the benefits if they report to the authorities they're a couple. I'm heterosexual, but I think that's what I'll do, since opposite sex couples can do that as well. The de-facto union legal contract is not supposed to be a sign of love.

As far as my mum I think the only difference is that before I use to run from the convo so she was more adamant in seeking out an argument and shouting crying at me to start praying and fasting, but these days I am eager to entertain the discussion and explain in a respectful way why and how I feel the way I do.   And weirdly enough she has been moderately 'understanding'. It's weird. She knows that I have only ""fasted"" (ahem, fake fasted)  2 days and then decided fuck it and popped down to Maccy D's to quench my kaffiring hunger.   Although, I'm certain that its a mental warfare type tactic that she's trying to employ lol. So I have no idea on what to make of it all."

exmuslim,3c82ay,hugga4u,8,Sun Jul 5 19:48:51 2015 UTC,These are cosmetic measures. Madressahs are openly training terrorists and no one has the balls to challenge that apart from a few brave members of the civil society. The banned sectarian and religious organizations are openly recruiting and holding their events.   I think isolated cases like these do not reflect the reality of the situation. In Pakistan the agenda is set by Islamists. If anything the current government is implementing more Islamist measures such as banning english versions of Islamic words and is thinking about enforcing an order for the markets to be closed during the prayer timings.
exmuslim,3c82ay,oneofthegoodassholes,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:07:28 2015 UTC,"Have to disagree. I think there has definitely been a shift in the last couple of years. Terrorism at least has been on the decline in the last few years due to army operations. The population can not continue being apologetic to something that has cost them the lives of around 50,000 people in the last few years.   The reluctance to go after Islamists is largely out of fear of losing votes. But the public has definitely shifted away from their apologetic attitude to Islamists. Violence was obviously never popular but even Wahabbism is being rejected. Parliament decided to not support Saudi invasion of Yemen, and massive protest rallies by degenerate Wahabbis were largely ignored.   The Supreme Court is even having a discussion on Secularism and the constitution. I think Pakistan is slowly returning to a pre-Zia era attitude."
exmuslim,3c82ay,oneofthegoodassholes,6,Sun Jul 5 21:17:30 2015 UTC,"Terrorism has decreased but extremism has not. If anything it has increased. Remember that it is extremism that causes terrorism not the other way around. Terrorists are like weeds that keep growing, you can root them out but it is the fertile soil of a radicalized society that keeps producing another one you have taken one out. People are largely unclear on the issue. A lot of people still view terrorists as Indian or American agents rather than having a true understanding of the situation.   How is Whabbism is being rejected? There thousands of seminaries openly brainwashing kids with Whabbism, one is actually doing right in the fucking capital. Parliament's decision to reject Saudi appeal for help was a decision made on cold foreign policy logic and had very little to do with Islam or Islamists. In fact there  are suggestions that the Chinese forced Islamabad to not join in.  Having a discussion is one thing, doing something about it is another. There are still blasphemy laws that no one will touch with a ten foot pole. You have open rallies by banned organizations. Zia's Pakistan is very much alive. Go ask any Pakistani about what they think of Malala, you would understand what I mean."
exmuslim,3c82ay,ShangZilla,3,Sun Jul 5 21:25:24 2015 UTC,"Actually extremists got even worse in the last years in Pakistan. This is clearly a power struggle competition, they just wont allow the wrong kind of extremism to be openly against government."

You say it's archaic, but in school we studied quranic verses and hadiths with explanations.

Some would turn into apologists, some might excuse it, some might ignore it.  I'm Arab, but my Arabic wasn't that good when I was younger because the only time I really use Arabic is when I speak to my parents (and even then, it's a combination of Arabic and English). It has improved drastically however after returning from a trip to Jordan a year ago.  Anyways..  when I was younger, I simply ignored it. I was the classic apologist, and liked ignoring what I didn't agree with. When I was 14, fed up with all these verses people kept quoting, I borrowed an English copy of the quran. Forgot who the translations were done by, but I did my research before picking one.   Flipped through pages and come across some sexist verses. Couldn't believe it. I slammed the book shut and hid it underneath my bed, and then returned it to the library the next day.  I decided to try to ignore it but it would always be on the back of my mind. a couple of years later, when I was on the verge of leaving because of other issues I found with Islam and decided not to ignore, I looked up these verses and tried to read them with an open mind, but couldn't excuse the sexism. This contributed to me finally leaving Islam.  Sorry for the story-long answer, but my point is that you can't predict the reaction, but I think it's safe to say that it will rock their faith, whether it happens immediately after, or years later. Basing it off of my experience, as well as that of others."

Maybe an argument like that would be somewhat useful.

exmuslim,3c8ko1,interestedinme,10,Sun Jul 5 22:26:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah no one really converts because they heard about ''the miracles in the Qu'ran''. Islam does provide some discipline and structure into some people's lives,especially if they come from broken homes and backgrounds. The emotional attachment part is merely what they call an ""Temporal Lobe Epilepsy''."
exmuslim,3c8ko1,AbduallahDaInfidel,-1,Mon Jul 6 00:43:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, because your armchair psychology diagnosis (Looks like a ton of you here) knows what one does something and why they do it. Hey, since it seems T.L.E. has a high prevalence of depression, I guess that means many of the users here are experiencing T.L.E. Believe me, I have a degree in Armchair Psychology."
exmuslim,3c8ko1,Redlaron,9,Mon Jul 6 01:06:27 2015 UTC,"No smart person would ever convert to Islam, Trust me I know.  Within a year or so, they realise the rules they engage in are bullshit, as to why they have to fast, as to why they have to pray. There is no reasonable reason to do so otherwise. A reasonable god won't judge a believer based on those things but by his character not by the amount of goody deeds he or she does written in an 7th century book."

exmuslim,3c8ko1,utnahpishtim,8,Mon Jul 6 05:13:36 2015 UTC,I've heard of several cases like this. I really can't understand how someone can go from rightfully hating Islam to converting to it.
exmuslim,3c8ko1,vestayekta,6,Sun Jul 5 22:41:06 2015 UTC,"It could be in the nature of the hatred. You sometimes hate something for not being perfect, far more than you care about something that's awful.  Like smug people. Everybody hates smug people, but they're pretty decent. It's just that they know it and they know their flaws and they're ... ok with it.  People don't care enough to hate boring people.  Islam has an allure, because some of what it does, the all encompassing nature of it, the huge community, the constant interactions and socialising (""prayer"") ... These are things that atheism and modernity have stripped from life.  If it wasn't such a shocking piece of shit when it comes to dealing with non-Muslims, I would happily pretend and go along with it."
exmuslim,3c8ko1,MohammedRidesAgain,3,Sun Jul 5 23:22:49 2015 UTC,I live in a Muslim country and i'm oblivious to these attractive qualities of Islam and I've never considered them. Thank you for a very interesting explanation. :)

Some will find the sense of community, order and common culture liberating and something that opens up a greater sense of self than they previously had.  Others will find it constricting and confining and rude and oppressive and domineering ...  I was an only child, I occasionally like the idea of being in the machine, but only occasionally and only intellectually. I was, after all, an only child."
exmuslim,3c8ko1,MohammedRidesAgain,3,Sun Jul 5 23:36:52 2015 UTC,But there are other ways to find a sense of community that don't demand so much self-sacrifice. Why do these people choose this blatantly sexist and cruel religion to fulfill their need for community?

exmuslim,3c8ko1,Redlaron,7,Mon Jul 6 00:16:20 2015 UTC,"There are a few intelligent Muslims. My best friend has an IQ over 170 (Mensa tested, as a teenager), but he's been a fundamentalist for over a decade now.  We used to discuss everything and anything. We were very very tight and he, being a few years older than me, was one of the few British Bangladeshis that I respected.  Sadly, his emotional problems regarding his father (problems rooted in his lack of height, I suspect, and his father's somewhat distant nature), made him vulnerable to structures that would give him a sense of self worth and purpose.  When he went fundamentalist, he tried to rope me into it, took me to his meetings and gave me the literature, but we argued and fell out after I derided Omar Bakri (Anjem's Yoda) when he introduced me to him.  From what I saw of the degenerate muslims in his group, they're all emotionally and/or mentally damaged people. Lacking the intellect or the will to address their problems and shortcomings and instead pouring themselves into this LARP lifestyle.  It's easy to deceive yourself, to convince yourself of the ""powerful spiritual message"" of a twat braying like a fool, five times a day. It's especially easy for highly intelligent people. History should teach that much at least.  Intelligence is no guarantee of rational or reasonable conduct. Most often, it is a sign of a self-indulgent person."

The Muslims I'm referring to, on the other hand, have no self-awareness, no self-reflection, merely a shallow conscience and Islam. It is their pain and emptiness that fuels their quest for the Caliphate. These are people that should be in therapy or in prison (or both)."

You might call that trolling, just like how you might call pointing out the fact that Muhammed was a pedophile is blasphemy, or as your religion might call a woman sleeping with her boyfriend to be grounds for her execution. Please do continue to teach the world about your version of 'true Islam' if the ""Wahabi Saudi Arabia' version is so inaccurate.

I used it to my advantage, kept her feeling conflicted and worried, whilst I went out with friends and girlfriends. Occasionally a girl would call and mum would answer the phone (this was before mobile phones, children) and I would just say that it was a school friend calling about a project. Mum wouldn't get mad. Mostly because she probably felt relieved, but not so certain that she would stop me ... lovely place to keep a parent.  They're so worried you're gay, that they give you freedom to be friends with and hang out with girls, hoping that you'll 'turn' straight.  Loved it.  The downside was that she tried to get me married off at 21, but I said no and she couldn't do anything about it at all.

exmuslim,3c9icu,ShangZilla,5,Mon Jul 6 04:47:00 2015 UTC,"Not Islam Muslim oppression British Empire Colonialism   Except, here are some classical rulings from Islamic jurisprudence.  Sharia means the body of Islamic law rooted in the Quran and the hadith; fiqh means the science of interpreting and applying this law, done by qualified Islamic judges and legal scholars. Over the first two centuries after Muhammad’s death in AD 632, four main Sunni schools of fiqh emerged, led by these scholars: Malik (d. 795), who lived in Medina, Arabia; Abu Hanifa (d. 767), who lived in Kufa, Iraq; Shafi (d. 820), who lived mostly in Mecca, Arabia, but who was buried in Cairo, Egypt; and Ibn Hanbal (d. 855) who lived in Baghdad, Iraq. They base their legal opinions and rulings on the Quran and the hadith. We examine the opinions of some of these schools.  Maududi records that Shafi himself says that ""both the criminals involved in sodomy should be killed, whether married or unmarried"" (vol. 2, p. 52, note 68).  However, later developments in the Shafi school go in different directions on the issue of punishing homosexuals as criminals. The brief law book from the Medieval Age, A Sunni Shafi Law Code (trans. Anwar Ahmed Qadri, Lahore: Sh. Muhammad Ashraf, 1984), says that ""the commission of sodomy and bestiality is an act which is equivalent to zina"" (adultery, fornication or rape) . . . (p. 118). A footnote says that ""legal punishment (stoning as done to adulterers) should be applied, but ""the accepted view is for tazir [the judge’s discretion] punishment"" (p. 118). So the punishment ranges from stoning to a judge’s discretion, possibly down to flogging.  Another Shafi law book, Reliance of the Traveler: A Classic Manual of Islamic Sacred Law, (rev. ed., trans. Nuh Ha Mim Keller, Beltsville, Maryland: Amana, 1994) also compiled in the Medieval Age, says that the punishment of stoning the homosexual must be imposed, provided that he or she has reached puberty, is sane, and committed the act voluntarily, ""no matter whether the person is a Muslim, a non-Muslim subject of the Islamic State, or someone who has left Islam"" (p. 610, o12.1). An additional requirement is whether the person can remain chaste (is in a legal marriage). Thus, this law book binds the judge to impose death by stoning, unlike the Sunni Shafi Law Code, which allows discretionary punishment.  Maududi also records an assortment of opinions that rule as follows: ""the punishment [for sodomy] is the same as for [zina], that is, one hundred stripes and exile for the unmarried, and stoning to death for the married"" (vol. 2, p. 52, note 68). Some scholars reinterpret banishment as imprisonment.  As for Abu Hanifa, Maududi says that the founder ""is of the opinion that the culprit should be punished in accordance with the circumstances of the crime with an exemplary punishment"" (vol. 2, p, 52, note 68). An exemplary punishment means that it must be done in public, so people will learn and fear. But it is clear that the judge may exercise discretion.  Malik decrees straightforwardly: ""Malik . . . asked Ibn Shihab about someone who committed sodomy. Ibn Shihab said, ‘He is to be stoned, whether or not he is muhsan’"" (legally married). Regardless of his marital status, then, someone who commits sodomy must be stoned—no mercy or extenuating circumstances. (Al-Muwatta of Imam Malik ibn Anas: The First Formation of Islamic Law, rev. trans. Aisha Bewley, Inverness, Scotland: Madina Press, 1989, 2001), p. 346, 41.1.11).  Before leaving the main section ""Islam,"" the last three subsections can be boiled down to this simple conclusion: Islam treats homosexuals as criminals and seeks to change them from the outside with threats, flogging, and death. This is seen clearly in Sayyid Qutb’s two sections in his commentary on Sura 4:15-16, which are titled ""First Step Towards Eradicating Immorality"" and ""A Perfectly Moral Society"" (In the Shade of the Qur’an, vol. 3, pp. 68-71). This goal, though seemingly noble, is actually harmful. No society can achieve perfect morality, and even the attempt to achieve it places severity and harshness and excessive power in the hands of the religious elite and self-righteous. So this policy and goal is completely misguided. It fails to understand human nature"

You'll have to change a part of who you are for this and learn Quran yourself. Say goodbye to western individualism.  2. If you have convinced yourself that Islam is legit .... I'm sorry, you're blinded by this woman.   As a man whose partner is Pakistani (8 years), marrying one is absolutely marrying the entire family (depends on which part of Pakistan they're from) . A 30k wedding is a duty, not a suggestion, an event is not a personal family event with your wife, you'll find the aunts, the uncles and whatever all there celebrating whatever it is which means tolerating the gossip and meeting the expectations so they don't shit on you.

Speaking objectively, the most important question is whether you can live as a Muslim without doubts and/or regret for the rest of your life. Secondly, are you fine with bringing your future children up with not only Islamic values, but also the influence of culture from your girlfriend's side? Her family and relatives will always try to nose into the upbringing of your child. Marrying her will also mean marrying into her family and relatives for the rest of your life.

We are happily married now, but I find it interesting you would come to an ex-moose forum for 'advise'. The million dollar question is- is she a practicing Muslim? My husband and I are both atheists- he is Hispanic with a staunch Catholic background and myself from a South East Asian Muslim family. My marriage could not be legally registered in my country if it was not done by Islamic rites. He absolutely had to 'convert'. Did we hesitate to get married? Hell no! We were and still are completely in love and we knew 'religion' is a small hurdle we had to overcome TOGETHER. Did he learn about Islam? My parents gave him like half a ton of books on Islam and over the few years we were dating, the more he learned the less he understood but he was never critical of it. He always tried to see the good side and make sense of it. However I knew him reading about Islam was like him reading a book on deep sea fishing. It was all good and interesting but he was no fisherman. Long story short, we have a child together now. We live far away from my family, and when we go back to visit, he feigns interest when my family engage him 'Islamic activities' and they seem very happy with that. He actually enjoys going to the mosque and doing the solat with my uncles (during Eid only) when he has no idea what the heck he's supposed to be praying about. To them he is learning slowly but surely.  I say our marriage works because we as a couple,: 1.understand the mentality of the families we were getting involved with 2. Made it clear religion was not important to each other 3. live far away from my Muslim family. What I sacrificed is : 1.not having my mother around after childbirth. 2.

Secondly, Islam isn't just the central tenets, it has a lot to do with the surrounding culture as well.   Here's what you need to evaluate. How religious is your would be wife? Would she choose religion and by extension her family and culture over you someday? Furthermore, to what extent will you be interacting with her family? Will they have any significant effect on her decision to marry you, or will they have a significant effect on her insofar as to influence your relationship with her, i.e. being more religious, having more children, etc?  Keep in mind that to stop at the central tenets of Islam is shortsighted; you must keep in mind the extension of Pakistani culture as well.   If you do have any questions on Paki culture, I can answer them  Best of luck."
exmuslim,3c77j0,callipygia,9,Sun Jul 5 17:54:24 2015 UTC,"It depends on who you are. Honestly, this subreddit will try to convince you on not joining. /islam will try anything to make you join. In the end of the day, if you're ok with the tenants of Islam -  go for it. However, remember that leaving Islam is a grave sin, an unforgivable one. If, you ever have a change of heart during your marriage; know you're risking losing your wife, possible kids and friends you make who are muslim."
exmuslim,3c77j0,moaw1991,4,Sun Jul 5 18:31:14 2015 UTC,"no, why she shouldn't be the one to convert to ""no god"" ?? I can understand your girl is moderate muslim, but still it's not about religion..."
exmuslim,3c77j0,CornPlanter,6,Sun Jul 5 17:02:55 2015 UTC,"Do you agree it's normal to not allow a girl to marry a man she loves just because he is not a muslim? Apparently you do, if you consider converting. Probably love impaired your judgement."
exmuslim,3c77j0,Mojomaniac666,6,Sun Jul 5 19:06:22 2015 UTC,"I just had an idea: go to her family and tell them you want to marry her but she has to become Christian/atheist etc. first. Then watch their reaction. If you don't dare to do so or if your GF doesn't want you to do so, then walk away because you now know they wouldn't tolerate any dissent. Also ask your self why it's always non-muslims who have to convert and not the other way around."
exmuslim,3c77j0,Anandya,3,Sun Jul 5 20:22:23 2015 UTC,"The problem with Islam is that it is an inherently conservative faith. You and her may be progressive and have ideas that are progressive, but you will always be fighting against a force of conservatism.   What's worse? Is that for converts, there is a distinct need to impress and adhere. More so than many ""native"" Muslims who were born into the faith. This is where extremism tends to sink its claws into you.   You can be a Muslim and hold progressive views. Those who think otherwise are simply daft. That's like saying the only way you can be a real Hindu is if you oppress Dalits.   Now here is the thing. You don't really believe in Allah do you? It's not like swapping churches you know. If you don't believe in something then it is a lie. A lie that will one day come out.   Now you can marry someone who isn't the same faith as you are. My fiancee is Hindu, I am an Atheist. My godparents are a Hindu and a Catholic. It can be done, but those are based on mutual respect.   I am sure your lady gets that there is more to a relationship than which god people believe in and that I personally think religion is not the best reason to marry or not to marry someone.   You can argue this and if she is brave she will accept you as an equal despite the religious mismatch. If her family is more progressive you can expect the same. However if they are not then you will be fighting down a tonne of expectation that you both are Muslims and there will always be idiots who take who you are at face value. While it is easy to be from a Western Culture to say ""screw them"" most people in Asian cultures form rather tight social bonds with family more than friends and alienation from family can be pretty rough."
exmuslim,3c77j0,Mojomaniac666,3,Sun Jul 5 18:05:46 2015 UTC,"No. Run while you still can. You don't want to do this to yourself and your future kids.  Also,I doubt you have the slightest clue 'of the tenets of islam' considering you wrote you agree with them. Do you think religiously sanctioned murder, rape, slavery and child abuse are OK? You may be thinking I am talking out of my ass. I am not. Go read up on islam and don't use the apologetic islam websites that just try to sweet talk you, describe you and lure you in. Use this instead. Also, if you convert and marry into a fundamentalist family and should you ever want to leave islam, you won't be able to, unless you are ready to literally fight for your life and are ready to run and hide. Apostasy is not only punishable by death, it would be a huge stain on that fundamentalist family's honor. This in the USA, 2015. 75% of muslim converts leave islam within a few years in the US. So chances are huge this will be you. Some muslims will try to tell you there's no death penalty for apostasy or that this is only true in an islamic country. Well, if you think that's true than read the many stories of ex muslims on this very forum fearing for their lives.   Go find somone else, You are about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Seriously."

exmuslim,3c77j0,exapologetica,2,Sun Jul 5 20:41:55 2015 UTC,I would strongly suggest checking out http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Main_Page before making any rash decisions. You may have read about the central tenets of Islam from apologists on the internet but being able to just read for yourself Bukhari or what the classical Islamic scholars like Ghazali had to say about issues like women's rights will really educate you on what culture you are about to enter into.
exmuslim,3c77j0,foolishimp,2,Sun Jul 5 22:51:15 2015 UTC,"Save yourself years and years of heartache, if you're contemplating marriage then you already are forming a commitment in your mind. Convert, get to understand her culture and traditions and where she comes from.  See it as expanding your understanding of humanity, and an additive approach, a cultural addition to your existing culture.  I've done it and it freed me from endless anger and frustration.  As far as the theology etc. goes I see it as a human tradition amongst many - let people believe what they will. I draw a line between the two of human religious beliefs and spirituality, and the empirical physical world.  EDIT:-  I need to qualify this as all my personal experience, others have made great counter points as to why you shouldn't. BUT, it's about you and your future wife and your level of commitment to each other - I would add no matter what the relationship even non muslim, catholic etc. if you can't get along with the extended family it would be a nightmare, so in all relationships you need to create a space between yourselves and the extended family."

exmuslim,3c77j0,A_shitty_Muslim,2,Sun Jul 5 15:37:43 2015 UTC,"Hi. Converting for love is much better than converting for money IMHO. Many people convert to Judaism or Catholicism already. It's all a time thing and who is willing to stand up against old beliefs like race, religion, gender identity, social classes, and culture. All old religions aren't what they used to be even in the last decade except for the un-adaptive areas of the Middle East, but they're changing slowly too. Thank goodness for the internet and relatively easy travel to other cultures.  As long as you and she understand that you may not be as conservative as her, but you will always respect her decisions and views(no matter how outdated they are to you). She needs to accept this and talk about how you will raise children together before you talk further about marriage. Talk about family gatherings, talk about American/Pakistani differences, talk about..dare I say it - converting only in name because you two love each other and you can't stand to be away from each other. :)  It won't be easy, but with any relationship comes work. If you're both willing to forgive your own feelings, and see from each other's POV, you can make anything work with compassion, understanding, and communication.   We all come from applied behavioral backgrounds. It's very few of us that are able to leave it fully behind. She'll probably stay traditional, but if she's living in America, she should incorporate its cultures too, so there is hope.   Good luck! PM me if you wanna talk more. I'm Muslim by culture, saved in a Christian church in middle America as a teen, then learned about Buddhism & Judaism later in life. As an Iranian/American family, we all were pretty much Muslim by name only; rarely went to mosque, never pray(I do on turbulent airplanes cause I don't wanna die), and I drink a beer here or there and eat pepperoni, masturbate frequently, don't give homeless money, etc."

I told her I have to change and it's effort but she's just got back in from work and dressed so she can do it. She replied she's also just changed. I told her how is she expecting ""help"" from me when we're exactly in the same position, therefore it's laziness that's preventing her to walk out for literally 5 minutes to get what she wants. She then shouted ""I'M FASTING"". I replied, ""Well that's your own fault, I didn't ask you to"". The venom in her voice when she called me selfish for not falling for her pity party. Plus the way she stated it was that she needed pads immediately making her fast redundant, so take a sip of water and do it yourself perhaps?

Each of the clan had a role assignment. If I recall my history right, the prime role assigned to Bani Hashim was taking care of the pilgrims to Mecca! Here is my hypothesis: Bani Hashim wasn’t set up to provide leadership for the Qureish given their role and Mo wanted more. Long time ago I read a story that when Mo was 4 or 5 years old, Bani Hashim clan had to endure a boycott from other clans and lived through some very harsh conditions. I suspect that boycott and the harsh conditions meant that he developed a lifelong insecurity. (This may explain why he would marry an older but richer woman Khadija). This MAY also explain why he chose to declare himself a prophet (not uncommon for that time and era - many competitors did that around the same time), i.e. set up his OWN League.   There is too much conjecture, and I am joining too many disparate threads, but unfortunately, there is very little unbiased history to go by. Furthermore, after Mo’s death, I suspect his legend grew bigger than his life and Ummayid rulers used the myth to further their grip on power!"
exmuslim,3c7dnl,itistemp,3,Sun Jul 5 19:41:22 2015 UTC,"Wow, this an amazing answer. Thanks!"
exmuslim,3c7dnl,itistemp,3,Sun Jul 5 20:06:19 2015 UTC,Clan history can explain this quite a bit IMO. That's why Mo had to marry so many women that he probably didn't care about. That's why the founder of modern Saudi state had so many wives and sons. That's how they consolidate power.

exmuslim,3c7dnl,MohammedRidesAgain,2,Sun Jul 5 16:04:51 2015 UTC,So why did he even bother taking others' work then?
exmuslim,3c7dnl,Ill_tell_you_my_sins,3,Sun Jul 5 16:08:15 2015 UTC,"(This is all supposing that Mohammed actually existed and did any of the things that he is supposed to have).  The simple answer is that divine sourcing makes the masses obedient as they won't question something they fear. And the Jews and Christians proved that their bullshit works on people.  So Mohammed probably just copied their shit because of its established success, altering it enough to place himself in charge of the narrative.  Of course, again, this is supposing that the whole existence of ""Mohammed"" isn't some bullshit that a bunch of Muslims invented to give antiquity to their hodgepodge faith."

exmuslim,3c7dnl,vestayekta,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:10:28 2015 UTC,Because there is no evidence from outside of arabia during his lifetime that he existed.
exmuslim,3c7dnl,str8baller,2,Mon Jul 6 11:28:40 2015 UTC,"Along with all the other comments that have been listed, you have to understand that living in the desert is a scary, scary lifestyle. It would actually be quite difficult to be an atheist (for me at least) living out in the open, completely exposed at all times to the elements. It makes sense that people would want to have something more concrete to hold onto asides from the religions of polytheism, which didn't have any structure to them. Additionally, it makes sense that he didn't just try to convert people to Judaism or Christianity, as they were not Arab-based and he would not have been able to lead the masses the same way.   If you read the Quran, especially the stories of Abraham, many of the arguments that are made could just as easily be made for atheism (see Abraham and the breaking of the idols). To me, the monotheistic religions represent the evolution of civilization; as humanity becomes more civilized, moving from hunter-gatherer societies to full-on cities and nations, the need for God becomes diminished, and so there is the shift from polytheism to monotheism to atheism."

Number 4: Questions that I have asked myself.   Why did Allah trick the Christians into believing it was Jesus who died on the cross (in islam its apparently a Jesus double that died); thus God created a false religion? Why is the only Miracle in Islam a book, the holy Quran. Which took 23 years to physically write (Judaism and Christianity has more than one Miracle) If Allah says do not be friends with the Jews/Christians [Qur'an 5:51]; [See also Quran  60:10] Why did Christians/Jews have to pay tax (Jizyah), to live among the Muslims? The Quran is incorruptible and Allah will protect it for ever (Tahrif)   Why would Muhammad's favorite wife Aisha say a goat ate part of the Quran which mentioned stonning and the succkling of breast of an grown man.[Ibn Majah 3:9:1944] Why would god allow the men who know the quran by heart to be killed in Battle of Yamama Why would he revealed it over 23 years, in parts [Quran 25:32] when he could have written it all down on stone like he did with the 10 commandments  Why would the almighty, all wise, all seeing Allah abrogate verses from his own book and replace them with new rules which are better [Quran 2:106]; Is allah a bad author? Why would Allah make us recite it when he has the entire Quran preserved on stone? [quran 85:22]  Why is it not written in chronological order? Did the muslims corrupt the text themselves when they collected it? Did allah expect the entire world to know Arabic? or did he only reveal this book to the Arabs to stop them from doing wrong things and lots lots more! [Questions_to_Ask_About_Islam]"

Like, it jumped from Adam in the garden, to Moses leading the people of Israel out of Egypt, to those same people worshiping a golden calf, all in less than a page.   It doesn't say who Adam is (or his spouse {women, am I right?}), why the people of Israel are enslaved or why they need to be free, who Moses is, or why a golden calf was cast in the fist place! If these stories weren't drilled into my brain as a child I would literally have no context for what is going on here and think the file for the ebook was corrupted super hard.

And then ... we'll explore the universe, the macro scale and micro scale. Keep striving to learn because if we don't then we are just bacteria, replicating and dying.  There is no higher purpose except what we decide for ourselves.  Maybe some day we can achieve immortality through technological means.

I started with following the path of Sufism-Zen, but I then realized that there is no path. A path to God/heaven/nirvana/samadhi means you're separate from God. But you're not. Hence there is no path  If you're meditating to see the real path, you'll essentially be doing the same thing Muslims are doing who bow down 5 times a day, so Allah get's pleased with them and grants them the path to Jannah. Meditate because you enjoy meditating.   What changed my life was realizing that life is purposeless. This removed all my stress. Because if there is no purpose to life, I am not missing out on anything. I just have to be in the present moment, and enjoy life."

exmuslim,3c6xe6,FaufiffonFec,-2,Sun Jul 5 21:03:34 2015 UTC,Praying to God to give you a big dirty unkept beard is just plain laughable. /u/Jedi-Mocro is a perfect example of the mundane bullshit Muslims focus their efforts on to please their ancient desert God and his Prophet.
exmuslim,3c6xe6,MooHamMadsBuraq,6,Sun Jul 5 21:12:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I don't find this kind of matters mundane though (and some at /r/islam agree too). I am saying your attitude leads nowhere. It's just like your use of 'big dirty unkept beard' : by grossly caricaturing Muslims, you yourself become a caricature. A clown.

exmuslim,3c66vi,GiddyRambler,9,Sun Jul 5 09:02:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry dude, I'm going to disagree. I think it's pretty cool that Mosques do this for people.  I agree: it would be better spent on the poor and the homeless rather than those who can afford it. But it is the Mosque's money. When you go to a restaurant and spend $20 on a salad, nobody says: ""You should have gone to the farmer's market and gave the rest to the poor"".  The money belongs to the Mosque and they can what they want with it. I'm not disputing that they could use the money to help people more; but so could you use your money that way (maybe you do, maybe you don't). For them it's a celebration during their special month. Let them have their fun; they're not hurting anyone."
exmuslim,3c66vi,CadmeusCain,2,Sun Jul 5 09:58:38 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I do think it's cool that they do this. I just wish they could also give food to the poor, or even donate the left over food. Maybe even have a potluck iftar instead? It just makes me cringe that they're using the money like this.  Donating it though would be following the (supposed) meaning of Ramadan to be more considerate to the poor. It is their money, but as a masjid which gives tons of khutbas about how we should be more kind to the poor and help them, I feel like they should also help with that. Even if it just means giving left overs to the poor instead of giving it away to people who (mostly) don't need it."

I think if you feel so strongly about this, perhaps you should approach them and make your feelings known. They might even do something about it.

Yesterday was also my last visit to the masjid (""Inshallah""). My parents wanted me to go once this year during Ramadan (in the hopes that I'd change my mind about prayer).   Maybe if I can ease into a conversation about it, I'll tell my dad, or even my brothers, to mention it to them. They're always at the masjid, so they're bound to know some of the people in charge of this."

exmuslim,3c66vi,Kohvazein,5,Sun Jul 5 14:01:37 2015 UTC,"It's an effort by the masjid to 'strengthen the ummah' during this holy month. We are just another group of ppl wasting food/money like anybody else. Restaurants, supermarkets, hotels- wasting food not on the needy is the norm in all developed/developing urban areas. Besides, it's unheard of any masjid providing food to homeless non Muslims on their grounds."
exmuslim,3c66vi,warrior12,7,Sun Jul 5 06:54:03 2015 UTC,"We are just another group wasting it, but in Islam, and especially during Ramadan, you're taught not to eat or waste senselessly, and to give to the poor. These iftar dinners kinda defeat the point of it. The extra food especially should be donated or saved for the next day, not be given out to people who can comfortably afford to buy the meal themselves.   Besides, it's unheard of any masjid providing food to homeless non Muslims on their grounds.    Yup. Even zakat is only meant to be given to help muslims (meaning donating to a non-muslim charity won't count as zakat). I highly doubt this conservative masjid would help non-muslims. Still, if they have to discriminate based on religion, it would be nice if they could take the food to muslim soup kitchens."
exmuslim,3c66vi,bobobaggy,7,Sun Jul 5 08:26:16 2015 UTC,"Except supermarkets, fast food chains and the like aren't claiming to be some peaceful, helpful miracle from God, Islam claims exactly that, but fails to act like it even still. I think Tescos give its soon to be expired food to the homeless now, so, I think we should all go join tescoism. Maybe it was Sainsbury... Sainsburyism?"

I warship him not of fear or long for jannah but rather because he is worthy of worship. Love Allah and he will love you back.   This is the top comment there atm  The greatest pile of utter bullshit and outright lie I have read in a long time. There are few things i am as certain about in life.  Abject terror of hell and the maniacal and disgusting lust for heaven is precisely why there are muslims. Take those factors away and leave everything else the same and I can guarantee muslims will not so easily boast about having ""1.6 billion followers""....in fact, i will be shocked if they still have a few million adherents.   Muslims don't love Allah. There is no ""love"" in this ""relationship."" Humans are Allah's slaves created for the sole purpose of worshiping him. Every act that a muslim performs adds scores on either his/her ""hell"" board or scores on his/her ""heaven"" board. The more scores there are on the ""hell"" board, the more time they will spend in hell and more scores they have on their ""heaven"" board, the quicker they will get into heaven and start fucking things.  Muslims live in constant terror of accumulating too many points on their ""hell"" board (because remember, everyone except Mohammad has at least some points on their ""hell"" board because you are never good enough for Allah to give you zero points because fuck you, that's why)....  How fucked up is that? You have to worship a jailer that has already tortured you for a few years in the hopes that he doesn't torture you for a few more years, or even your whole life, and you can never be certain what will make him increase or decrease the number of years to your sentence."

From my original comment posted earlier:  It's funny, the Saudis had to bring in tanks and heavy equipment to try and flush the terrorists out, to do Allah's work for him. Obviously Allah is so weak and powerless that he couldn't even protect his holiest of holies and needed infidels to complete the job. In the turmoil, several minarets and even the kaaba was damaged. Probably close to a thousand people died in the siege, but obviously the Saudis had covered up the true numbers. Osama bin wankin even wrote an open letter to the government condemning the bringing in of tanks and infidels into the sacred Harem, and it was part of his many grievances against the Saudi state."

For those too lazy to open the link:  ''The Grand Mosque seizure occurred during November and December 1979 when extremist insurgents calling for the overthrow of the House of Saud took over Al-Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The insurgents declared that the Mahdi (the ""redeemer of Islam"") had arrived in the form of one of their leaders – Mohammed Abdullah al-Qahtani – and called on Muslims to obey him.  The seizure of Islam's holiest site, the taking of hostages from among the worshipers, and the deaths of hundreds of militants, security forces and hostages caught in crossfire in the ensuing battles for control of the site, all shocked the Islamic world.

exmuslim,3c6brn,sanjithecook,6,Sun Jul 5 06:29:26 2015 UTC,"You'd often hear apologist say that God made mountains as pegs to hold/stabilize earth.  Actually, most mountains are formed by the clashing of tectonic plates. From a geographic standpoint, there on top of the most unstable regions on the earth."
exmuslim,3c6brn,robotroller,4,Sun Jul 5 07:34:36 2015 UTC,Didn't really answer my question but what you're saying is mountains do not stabilize the earth but in fact are representations of the most unstable places on earth (because the plates collide there) right?  But my question is if the Quran's prediction of the number of stages there are in planetary development (there are 4 stages and the Quran also says the earth was created in 4 stages) then can it be considered a scientific miracle (doubt it but I like to entertain every possibility)?
exmuslim,3c6brn,Mojomaniac666,3,Sun Jul 5 08:04:08 2015 UTC,"But the four stages in the koran completely differ from the four stages in the article you linked. The only thing identical is the number four. Also, it's obvious that the world and heaven wasn't created in 6 days as the koran claims."

exmuslim,3c6brn,CadmeusCain,5,Sun Jul 5 18:30:43 2015 UTC,I have no idea what is impressive about this. The number 4?
exmuslim,3c6brn,CadmeusCain,2,Sun Jul 5 07:46:16 2015 UTC,Basically planetary development occurs in 4 stages. Quran claims that the earth was created in 4 stages/periods. Is it just a coincidence that the Quran got the number of stages right or is the Quran really scientific (doubt it but I like to entertain every possibility)? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding something
exmuslim,3c6brn,fishfhead,7,Sun Jul 5 08:01:48 2015 UTC,"Quran claims that the earth was created in 4 stages/periods   it says Allah took 4 days (or however you want to interpret that word) to determine how much stuff was needed in the earth for it to sustain life. It is not talking about the creation of the earth. The ayah immediately before this one talks about the creation of the earth - in two days.   And the verse immediately after it says he then returned to the heavens when they were smoke, which looks like an outright error since there was no smoke involved, even if we are overlooking the issue of order of creation.  And the one immediately after that is talking about the lowest of (seven) heavens being decorated with stars, which sounds exactly like the 7 heavened geocentric model of ancient mythology, where stars are lights on the dome of the firmament, raised up over a flat earth.   In general, any non instantaneous process can be divided into as many or as few stages as you like. i don't think any instance of the  'correct number of stages' could be impressive, since the number of stages is determined by how people divide things up. 'Number of stages' is something that relates to the way humans like to comparmentalise in order to understand.    In addition, even if the quran really was talking about 'an objectively accurate number of' stages of the earth's development, and was detailed and accurate, you still couldnt infer that it's foreknowledge of terrestial planetary development, since there is no evidence that the author of the quran is aware that the earth even is a planet. It strongly suggests that the sun orbits it."
exmuslim,3c6brn,fauzi_indo,4,Sun Jul 5 08:09:24 2015 UTC,You know I think I messed up when I read the ayah before it (the one talking about the earth being created in 2 stages/days). I guess I just automatically assumed that since the earth's creation was being talked about that it was going to continue on into the next verse.   Yeah I feel like Islam had a lot of influence from ancient mythology which I should go back and study at some point.    since the number of stages is determined by how people divide things up   That's a pretty good point. And yeah I do get geocentric vibes from the Quran as well
exmuslim,3c6brn,Kohvazein,5,Sun Jul 5 09:09:17 2015 UTC,"http://quran.com/41/10  On this website you have a sidebar where you can access multiple translations. Muhsin Khan, Muhammad Pickthall, Yusuf Ali, Muhammad Shakir and Dr Ghali are all recognised Islamic scholars whose translations have the broader Islamic community's approval.   Almost all of them refer not to 4 'stages' but to 4 'days'. The Quran claims the universe was created in 6 days in order to mirror the Genesis account in the Torah. Much of the Quran refers either directly or indirectly to the Torah. The word is 'yom' in Hebrew and 'ayam' in Arabic both meaning 'day'. Modern apologists have translated 6 'days' as 6 'periods'. So they say a period can be any length so it's not a contradiction with science. You're now saying that 'yom' means stage. Does that mean everything else before the Earth was created in 2 stages?  This isn't a miracle and isn't a coincidence. It's a translator going through the Quran and looking for verses that can be interpreted as figures of speech so that it is consistent with some observation made by the scientific world, when in reality, the Quran says the world was created in a long weekend."
exmuslim,3c6brn,CadmeusCain,5,Sun Jul 5 09:04:41 2015 UTC,"I guess my suspicions were valid to some extent. Yeah my translation definitely says ""stages"" and not periods and definitely not days.

Nothing about what you linked, nothing detailed, nothing substantial, to I dictate he is talking about the creation of planets via a stars birth/rebirth. I don't see any of the steps mentioned In your quote, it simply says 4 stages. Googling ""4 stages planets astronomy"" would get you the same results but they mean nothing.   It's simply an arbitrary number that was thrown out and now scholars and yourself are trying to piece it together with modern day science. If I said ""4 steps""  1400 years ago, would I be a scientific miracle? Under your logic, yes, as I ""just got the number right""."
exmuslim,3c6brn,Salisillyic_Acid,3,Sun Jul 5 08:03:53 2015 UTC,The problem with these modern translations is that modern scholars already know the facts and try to interpret the Quran in a way to show that the Quran knew it all along. Most secular scholars will tell you that the Quran was written 1400 years ago and reflects the understanding of that time. At no point in history has the Quran ever led us to a scientific understanding: rather something is discovered and then Imams claim the Quran knew it all along.   Here is an example of how the Quran supports geocentrism. Near the bottom of the article is a quote from an Islamic scholar claiming that the sun being the centre of the Solar System can't be true because it goes against the Quran:  http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran  Here is an article showing where the Quran actually implies that the Earth is flat:   http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Flat_Earth_and_the_Quran  The Quran is actually riddled with scientific errors.

exmuslim,3c5e4z,skepticwest,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:05:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I've said that. We may have a misunderstanding here. It seemed to me you claimed no one followed literal readings, when in fact what you meant was that people don't instantly do as they are told through text.  But back to your primary point. The ""Buddhists"" may think their actions are mandated by their religion, but the texts show a different story. As opposed to when extremist muslims think their actions are mandated by their religion.  The question is: Does the text endorse the action?"
exmuslim,3c5e4z,Precaseptica,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:21:45 2015 UTC,"Religious texts mean what their followers say, it's almost impossible to ascribe them meaning without reference to what people think they mean. Arguably no reasonable Jewish reading reading today would accept Christ as the awaited messiah, and yet early Christians are reasonably described as a Jewish sect.   ""What the text endorses"" is not a meaningful question for atheists who generally recognize that religious texts can be interpreted innumerable ways, many of which can be inconsistent with each other. Violent Pentateuch verses are regarded by Jewish scholars as advocating the lesser of evils type lessons. Calls for war can be contextualized as irrelevant for modernity. In religion there few rules, and they change over time. This obsession with ""Islam says bad things and Buddhism doesn't"" is an impoverished approach to both religions and any violence that originates from them. What matters is what people take to heart, how they actually come to those decisions, attitudes, predispositions, and actions. This line of thinking was the single original contribution of Harris and it's unsurprisingly intuitively appealing while being facile and pernicious."
exmuslim,3c5e4z,skepticwest,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:32:48 2015 UTC,That's like calling Hitler a soldier of Christ cus he sometimes refered to the Christian God in his speeches. It is possible to call yourself something and for it to not be true.  Islam is in direct opposition to Buddhism when it comes to how much the religious text itself inspires violence and warmongering. A literal reading of Buddhist texts will not produce the Myanmar massacre. A literal reading of the Quran produces ISIS.

We allowed people of all faiths and cultures to come and that was fine, but we didn't do it well. We kept the Muslims, the Poles and the rest into respective communities instead of integrating them into our society. Australia had taken in just as much immigrants (i think) and they turned out fine, because they displaced them, they integrated them. Secondly, Australia stopped and began limiting their immigration, tightening it. We didn't, the immigrants kept coming in. They're willing to do work at a lower price than any Briton, so obviously, employers hire them to cover better expenses, they can amass a larger workforce at the same price. So when you hear a Brit saying ""Dey took our jabs"", they're not exactly wrong. And when a Brit says ""They're taking over our towns"", they're not exactly wrong, we put them into our towns. It's the UK's fault, though."

Keeping them all in one area also makes it harder for them to integrate into society, and that goes to other immigrants as well. Like at the china town in city near me, a lot of the store employees don't speak English.  Spreading them out would also help them interact more with their non-muslim neighbors, and help them understand that not all non-muslims are evil.

One of the weird things when looking at America is that the different white ethnicities (Irish, English, Italian, Scandinavian, scottish) have NOT mixed together that much. They still congregate in their regions.   So I am not optimistic"
exmuslim,3c4kbg,Audunis,2,Sat Jul 4 23:22:49 2015 UTC,"It is an extremely slow process because people are still caught up with the whole mentality of belonging to a race, religion, culture, color, etc. It would be much faster if people slowly stopped thinking in terms of such groups, and this will happen gradually as we all learn, work, and live together - we will realize that we are not that different as we thought. It is slow because we human beings love stability, and it is not easy shifting from something (our cultures) that was built over centuries within just a decade or two. See, how we are all cooperating right now on the internet as individuals, and don't really think about what color, religion, race, etc that we are having conversations with anymore. So it is possible and in fact inevitable with time.   Look at America for example. People's inability to see past the differences are still causing black vs white crimes based on race, and all those racism against muslims post 9/11. So people still can't all see past that, but we are integrating a lot more than we used to in the past when we stayed within our own borders. If you think about it, it is ridiculous for us to get caught up arguing with each other over things that we never had any choice over but were born into. I believe that once more people decide to not let these differences prevent them from working together, there is a lot we can accomplish together. I even have a sub /r/UnitedWeStand that was built to bring like minded people together."

exmuslim,3c4kbg,Audunis,4,Sat Jul 4 23:36:54 2015 UTC,"They are resistant to the idea, because they want to keep their traditions and cultures. However, realistically as others have stated, there is no real positives to staying separate than for the different cuisines and ""exotic"" experiences.   People don't because over centuries it has been taught that we must stay pure, and that our ""nation/race/culture"" is better than the rest. Every nation in the world believes that it is better than the rest and shouldn't mix. However, when we work together, those ideas just die on their own without being forced to ""blanda up"".   There are dozens of reasons why people should work together. I am not even kidding. We are meant to be a global family, and just one of the most amazing things we have done together is create the internet. However, it is not realistic to convince anyone with such logical arguments and undo centuries of thinking differently - it simply will be changed by experiencing it and seeing for themselves.   I think many white ""privileged"" people have come to realize this before others, but is not something limited to them. I am not white, and I realize why this is inevitable and something we should embrace."
exmuslim,3c4kbg,lastresort08,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:43:35 2015 UTC,"How this sounds to me: we will force immigration in large quantities, and then put the burden on you to integrate.

Especially when only Europeans seem to care about that, as their dabbling in multiculturalism has shown."
exmuslim,3c4kbg,Audunis,2,Sat Jul 4 23:46:47 2015 UTC,"First, I am completely against how modern liberalism works. Nothing should ever be forced, even if it is beneficial. I don't trust any one person to decide for me or anyone else, and people should have the freedom to decide for themselves. So in other words, absolutely no need for propaganda to integrate people together.   There are many reasons for why we should integrate, starting with our own history. This TED video explains it briefly. Things like modern science, the internet, etc wouldn't exist as we know now, if we didn't work together. Our clothes, houses, food, etc are all made by others that are not directly related to us. Money was essentially something that was created to allow us to work together, and see past our differences, and there is no way we would have created all this if we just cared only for our own kins. We do more than we could have ever done alone in one life time, because we work on top of ideas that were built by others."
exmuslim,3c4kbg,lastresort08,2,Sun Jul 5 00:03:05 2015 UTC,"I am glad you are against forcing integration, but considering Section 8 does exist and does force diversity onto neighborhoods in the US I can't really count on you taking control of the machine.  Sadly he makes the mistake everyone makes on this issue: treating cultural differences as trivial. I am certain if America, the commonwealth, China, Europe, and Russia worked together things could happen.  But outside of cultures that value cooperation, even if only for cynical goal seeking, I see it as a failure.  And most immigration is from uncooperative cultures."
exmuslim,3c4kbg,Audunis,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:08:43 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with what you have shared.   There are lot of bumps along the way. Liberals who have good intentions are simply screwing the entire thing over by making it forced, and being blind to the fact that many cultures are simply uncooperative. People have to learn these things through their experience, as beliefs cannot be changed by force. It will take a lot of time before things get better, and frankly, people decide how fast things progress. The more these ideas are forced on others and the more it is resisted in retaliation, the slower the progress becomes.   I don't see it as a failure, but I see it as incredibly slow because of our inability to take proper actions and not think without our emotions. People who were brought up with this idea of cultural purity for 50 or so years, simply won't change their ideas, and perhaps never will - but it will slowly change with younger generations. This is already clear as younger generations of immigrants care less and less about maintaining purity and their traditions."
exmuslim,3c4kbg,lastresort08,2,Sun Jul 5 00:28:37 2015 UTC,"Diversity is a sign of a society that accepts others, and that's usually a sign of progressive society. Diversity alone is not a factor that increases quality of life, and I don't think any person worth taking seriously says that.  Being accepting of others in conjunction with other traits (like freedom of expression) is what leads to an improvement in quality of life.   The ""multiculturalism"" you see in Europe is corrupted and used to push agendas.   The way it works in America is the ideal - diversity is seen as a good thing, as long as everyone's a consumer and American first. Adopting an American identity is easier than trying to be German or French or British though, seeing as its a nation built on immigration."

The answer is obvious.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_crime_in_the_United_States#Racially_motivated_hate_crime   While there is a correlation between blacks and Hispanics and crime, the data implies a stronger tie between poverty and crime than crime and any racial group, when gender is taken into consideration.[45] The direct correlation between crime and class, when factoring for race alone, is relatively weak. When gender, and familial history are factored, class correlates more strongly with crime than race or ethnicity.[46][47] Studies indicate that areas with low socioeconomic status may have the greatest correlation of crime with young and adult males, regardless of racial composition, though its effect on females is negligible.[46][47]   And if you don't trust wikipedia:   http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/www/external/labor/seminars/adp/pdfs/adp_ajph.pdf"

You are not talking to me as a member of whatever group I belong with, but as an individual, and so that's the ultimate goal.

Muhammad did not believe the accusation and stipulated that even to make such an accusation, one needs 4 male witnesses (or 2 females in place of each male). If the minimum number of witnesses are not present then one should keep their mouth shut OR they will be flogged.  That is the traditional story behind the rule. Who knows what the actual origin is."

And let not pity for the twain withhold you from obedience to Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a party of believers witness their punishment. Scourge adulterers and adulteresses with 100 stripes. Do not show them any pity. Have a party of believers watch the punishment. This was one of the three verses used in the film Submission.  24:3 The adulterer shall not marry save an adulteress or an idolatress, and the adulteress none shall marry save an adulterer or an idolater. All that is forbidden unto believers. Only adulterers can marry adulteresses. Believers are not to marry them.  24:4 And those who accuse honourable women but bring not four witnesses, scourge them (with) eighty stripes and never (afterward) accept their testimony - They indeed are evil-doers -      If you accuse an honorable women of adultery, be sure to bring four witness. Otherwise you will receive 80 lashes.  24:5 Save those who afterward repent and make amends. (For such) lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.  24:6 As for those who accuse their wives but have no witnesses except themselves; let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies, (swearing) by Allah that he is of those who speak the truth;  24:7 And yet a fifth, invoking the curse of Allah on him if he is of those who lie.  24:8 And it shall avert the punishment from her if she bear witness before Allah four times that the thing he saith is indeed false,  24:9 And a fifth (time) that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaketh truth.  24:10 And had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you, and that Allah is Clement, Wise, (ye had been undone).  24:11 Lo! they who spread the slander are a gang among you. Deem it not a bad thing for you; nay, it is good for you. Unto every man of them (will be paid) that which he hath earned of the sin; and as for him among them who had the greater share therein, his will be an awful doom.  ""His will be an awful doom""  24:12 Why did not the believers, men and women, when ye heard it, think good of their own own folk, and say: It is a manifest untruth ?  24:13 Why did they not produce four witnesses? Since they produce not witnesses, they verily are liars in the sight of Allah.   I think there are a few hadiths that apply the same line of thought to rape and homosexuality but I can't find them. But the point is you can only prove something with four witnesses or if you are a muslim male you can prove it by swearing 5 times and she can avert that by swearing 5 times too. I don't really understand that part either, maybe he thought people would be more afraid of lying to god than the punishment of lashes."

exmuslim,3c5dea,hexag1,3,Sat Jul 4 23:20:59 2015 UTC,"Interesting article. Here's the main excerpt for those too lazy to read the whole thing (like me) :  Islam: Like Satanism and the Creativity Movement, Islam does not adhere to the Golden Rule. The closest that Islam comes to this principle is a hadith that says:    ""None of you [truly] believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself."" [Number 13 of Imam ""Al-Nawawi's Forty Hadiths.""]    The same hadith is reported by Bukhari 1.2.12  ""The Prophet said, ""None of you will have faith till he wishes for his (Muslim) brother what he likes for himself.""  This brotherhood however does not extend to everyone. Quran (9:23) states that the believers should not take for friends and protectors (awlia) their fathers and brothers if they love Infidelity above Islam. In fact there are many verses that tell the Muslims to kill the unbelievers and be harsh with them. A clear example that Islam is not based on the Golden Rule is the verse (48:29) It says: ""Muhammad is the messenger of Allah; and those who are with him are strong against Unbelievers, (but) compassionate amongst each other.”    This is the perfect definition of fascism. There are many other verses that show the brotherhood in Islam is not universal. The rest of mankind have no rights and should not be treated in the same way that Muslims are to be treated. The entire Quran is the breach of the Golden Rule. Quran tells Muslims to slay the unbelievers wherever they find them (2:191), do not befriend them (3:28), fight them and show them harshness (9:123), and smite their heads (47:4).      According to Muslims it is not the Golden Rule that defines the good and bad but it is Muhammad who does it. They believe what is good for Islam is the highest virtue and what is bad for Islam is the ultimate sin. This is the ethos of all cults. From Asahara’s Aum  Shinrikyo to Jim Jones’ People’s Temple; from Sun Myung Moon’s Unification Chruch to David Koresh’s Davidain Branch, the recurring theme in all of them is that the cult’s interests overshadow the human understanding of right and wrong and to advance the interest of the cult, which is regarded as the ultimate good, everything, including lying, even murder and assassinations are permissible. The end is deemed to be so lofty that it justifies the means. This is the same idea of fascism where the glorification of the state and the total subordination of the individual are enforced. In fascism, “the state is defined as an organic whole into which individuals must be absorbed for their own and the state’s benefit. This ‘total state’ is absolute in its methods and unlimited by law in its control and direction of its citizens.” [The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001]   Muslims consider themselves to be the “guided people” and everyone else as kafir and fuel for hellfire. Their properties, their lives and even their wives are halal to Muslims. The people of the Book can buy their security by paying Muslims a protection fee called Jizyah but if they stop that payment, they too would be fought against and destroyed.       Like Satanists, and the skinhead neo-Nazis, Muhammad did not believe in the Golden Rule. He instructed his followers to lie to their victims to win their trust and when they lower their guards, kill them. He sent one of his disciples to the Meccans and to the Bani Quraiza and told him to lie to both groups and to deceive them. Then he added: “war is a game of deception”. Couldn’t a man who was capable of lying, assassinating his opponents, massacring his captives of war and causing sedition to advance his malicious designs, lie about being a prophet of God? Once it is established that he broke the Golden Rule and lied and encouraged lying on several occasions, why should we believe him when he claims to be a messenger of God?    Muhammad raided innocent civilians with no warning, butchered the men and took the women and children as slaves and then he allowed his men to rape the women. How do Muslims like to be treated in this way? What Muhammad did was against the Golden Rule. But Muslims have no regards for the Golden Rule. They question the legitimacy of this universally acclaimed principle. They think it was okay for Muhammad to kill non-Muslims, rape their wives and enslave their children, but it is not okay for non- Muslims to do the same to Muslims. If this is not a satanic religion, in what ways does it differ? Muslims should tell us what criteria they use to determine that Muhammad was a messenger of God."
exmuslim,3c4yi2,Meowz95,14,Sat Jul 4 20:54:16 2015 UTC,"Your mum is giving you a head start in life (think of all those who took out loans and moved into accommodation paying thousands per year to live on camus and enjoy the party life while you get to be at home)  Since you are an only child, I highly doubt she will disown you. You are probably a very important part of her life. (Since you say she was single for a long time)  She is also very lenient and you get to do    (I can wear shorts, dresses/ skip fasts during Ramadan/ eat non-Halal/ have guy friends etc.) but she expects me to believe in religion and go to the mosque.   I think you should find a way to keep her happy. It's more to do with meeting her emotional needs then anything else.   I mean, she probably legit thinks you will burn in hell if you don't believe in Allah. So just don't tell her.  I'm not really an expert at this so here are my 2 pence."
exmuslim,3c4yi2,hpboy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:32:10 2015 UTC,"I really like this advice, thanks. I think I should be more understanding of how she LEGIT believes in Islam and probably never questioned it before, and wants the best for me."
exmuslim,3c4yi2,KisahMelati,7,Sun Jul 5 18:03:41 2015 UTC,"Your mother sounds like a really nice and educated lady and so do you. I can understand you feel frustration because you have all these conditions set on your life and no outlet to vent with people who understand.  As a mother myself to a little girl, all we want is the best for our daughters and for muslim mothers, religion and this belief in God/Allah is the last 'protection' we can offer our children till the day comes when we are physically no longer on this earth. (I say 'we' as in I'm channeling my devout mother and trying to imagine that's how your mother thinks too). I myself had a rocky relationship with my own mother, we could never see eye to eye and in many aspects I know she could not understand my thinking. But she prays for me, tells me to pray, comes to tears with the fear that her daughter will be condemned to the hellfire. That is her belief. It's fear instilled in her because she was taught that and cannot accept anything other than the Islamic way of life. From what you've written about your mom, I doubt she would disown you or cut ties. You still depend on her financially so until you are truly independent, it would be best if you just tow the line, out of love, gratitude and respect (No drama at home = no drama to distract from school). Do the minimum to satisfy her when it comes to religion, it sucks, I know, I've done it too, but she will sleep better because of it. A Muslim parent acknowledging the loss of faith of their child is something that will take years to accept. Talk to your mom about other things in your life not centered around Islam so you both can reconnect. Remember, this might take years so take it easy on yourself and your mom. Perhaps, she can never accept your loss of faith and be angered and hurt when it comes up. Only you will know the best way to handle that situation and hopefully by that time you will have the means to walk away to let things cool down. A mothers love is unconditional. Peace and love to you."

exmuslim,3c4yi2,lirannl,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:12:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! Oops I probably should've been more clear that it isn't a super forced marriage - nowadays in the US (in my area, at least) you are just presented a picture of bio of a ""potential person"" and it's your choice to pick him/her after you meet him/her a few times. It's still arranged in a way though, which I don't really like. And he has to be from my certain sect so it's very limited anyway, lol. But I'll definitely have a talk about this with her once I get older."
exmuslim,3c4yi2,Mojomaniac666,6,Sun Jul 5 18:08:17 2015 UTC,"Do NOT marry the way she expects. Try avoiding running away, but if it's either running away or arranged marriage, run away.  Other than that, if you run away, contact her a month later to see if she's willing to accept your atheism. I know you'll feel guilty, and that's what's supposed to happen. Religions are built to keep people from exiting them. Emotional blackmail can be very useful for such a purpose.  Don't spend your life going to mosques. Suck it up until you finish college, but then come out to her. Do not do so in her face, maybe leave a note and run away temporarily for a day or 2-4, to let her boil in her thoughts a little before you confront her. Try getting information about how she reacts without her knowing you're there, ask friends or neighbours or something. Tell her in a note you'll return in 2-4 days.  Be prepared for a permanent runaway in case her reaction would be life risking for you. You don't want to leave her with your documents in that case, of course, in that case, also alert the police.  Of course, if she doesn't seem life threatening to your coming out, restore contact with her."
exmuslim,3c4yi2,studylearnknowledge,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:10:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice! I think the best thing is to suck it up and go to the mosque before I move out, indeed. But yeah I hate how restricting and binding religion can be. It's very scary.

exmuslim,3c4yi2,studylearnknowledge,2,Sun Jul 5 18:51:58 2015 UTC,"There's lots of good books out there about atheism, spiritualism, religion, evolution (check out this MIT evolution book list) etc. that back up your rightful doubts. Esp. you as a student should be well versed in evolution and talk about it with her. If you can crack her religious door a bit open, it will be much easier to open it even further later on. You could also tell her you'd be happy to discuss religion with her, but not unless she reads some of these books first in order to have a broader understanding. So maybe if you slowly introduce her to this, i.e. that you don't need religion to be good and decent and that hell and heaven or constructs created by men, that evolution exists and islamic 'science' is wrong, she would probably understand and come to terms with it and, consequently let you go without destroying the relationship you two have. If she could realize islam is not the only way to 'salvation' and that you are happy as a non muslim, that would be one big step. After all, a loving mother should have her only child's interest at heart. As a start, you could get one of these books and 'accidentally forget' it on the kitchen table or your night stand. She will then mention it and you can discuss it or ask her to read it. Don't be confrontational because then she won't do it. I think you can probably get more out of it (tuition, intact relationship, not running away etc.) this way than by running away as you are not  being threatened. Things would change of course if she wanted you to marry some guy. In that case, I would pack my stuff, leave and get a loan or job so you can finish college and be independent.  Best of luck."

I'm not sure if I want to confront her with the atheism stuff while I'm living with her, but maybe after I move out, that might be a good idea.

It seems Muslims are their own enemy LOL. You reckon the Sinai is part of another big ISIS project? I think so."
exmuslim,3c4uzl,AbduallahDaInfidel,2,Sat Jul 4 23:24:05 2015 UTC,"Sisi is in bed with Salafis. Nour party supported the coup. They'd better deal with half-secularism than with other forms of islamism. Fuck Sisi. Nasser FTW, the best guy ever. Wish he never went to Yemen to fuck with back-then pro-Saudi Shias and make a deal with Israel instead of helping these Islamic Palestinian retards or just beat it, liberate Palestine and unify Arabs under secular dictatorship of his own after mobilizing popilar masses in his support (which he'd get for beating Jews down, thus less popular base for political Islam among common folk). Doesn't matter, the world would be better in either case while Islam would be on the decline."
exmuslim,3c4uzl,Salisillyic_Acid,2,Sat Jul 4 23:49:48 2015 UTC,"Nasser's Arab Vietnam in Yemen was such a big mistake. His successors should shoulder the blame for rising Islamism as much as the Islamists themselves. You have people like Anwar Sadat appearing on TV during jumah, often seen with prayer beads in his hands. I feel like the mistake made by both Saudis and Egyptians was trying to 'out Islam' the fundamentalists. Or maybe it was to appeal to the general masses by wearing an air of religiosity.   You just can't put the religious genie back in the bottle."

exmuslim,3c4uzl,Salisillyic_Acid,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:30:38 2015 UTC,"Jahilis, servants of taghut, munafiqun, moulhid folks, mushrikin, zanadaqa, kuffar, murtadin. Al-Azhar are palace muftis. Same crap as quiteist apolitical Madkhaliya Salafism. Nasser forced them to issue the fatwa in 1952. It called Druzes and Arab gnostics (Syrian Alawites) Muslims despite syncretic nature of their religions. Purely political move as a rehearsal before creation of United Arab Republic, nothing religious. Al-Azhar are bitches of whoever is in charge."
exmuslim,3c4uzl,Your_socks,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:58:00 2015 UTC,Does Al Azhar still have a good reputation amongst the ulema? I hear names like Umm Al Qura a lot more than a hear about Al Azhar these days. Especially since they seem to have been co-opted by the Egyptian state.   Edit: I love how evil the word 'taghout' sounds.
