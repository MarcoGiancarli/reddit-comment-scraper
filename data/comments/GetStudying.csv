It's written by young people who all got perfect or near-perfect scores, so it's both informative and entertaining to read.

GetStudying,3e3g7q,bullseyes,3,Wed Jul 22 00:21:24 2015 UTC,"For the practice exam you took, make sure you go through each section and review all the questions that you got wrong. It's not going to be easy - you might be really frustrated when you don't understand some of the questions and why you got them wrong. Do your best to figure out why you got each question wrong and try to remember how to do it the next time. The nature of the questions on the SAT are repetitive, especially in math and writing. The same concepts come over and over again. Once you solidify those concepts, you will be scoring high every time. I was able to drastically improve my writing and math score just by practicing and familiarizing myself with how the SAT 'worked.' Once you get used to the questions, you speed through the sections. I was getting each math section done in ~10 minutes in the real SAT, and I was still able to get a perfect score. I finished the writing section in about 15 minutes (35 question section) and got a 780.  Also, I can't help you much with reading, it was my worst section.

GetStudying,3e3g7q,ablueoyster,2,Tue Jul 21 19:58:58 2015 UTC,"I respect your perseverance to pursue education, and I here are some tips I think you'll like.  For Mathematics: Use this link to see the mathematics syllabus(the topics you'll be tested on): https://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/sat-mathematics-review.pdf  Based on these topics, learn from Khan Academy at this link: https://www.khanacademy.org/math  For Memorization of vocabulary words, use Memrise. It spaces out revision times to ensure that you retain most of what you are learning. They have a good SAT preparation course too, take a look at it at this link: http://www.memrise.com/course/948/sat-comprehensive/  For writing practise: Use PaperRater to check quality of your writing at this link: https://www.paperrater.com/ Do understand that it's highly suggested to get another person, preferably a teacher from a nearby school, to mark your essay(s). The website above just checks if your essay uses right amount of vocabulary words. There's no shame in asking for help in studying, so ask an English teacher to mark your essays/writings on a weekly basis. You can hire someone to mark your essays, if you want to.  For practise, I recommend Khan Academy (based on u/sex_and_cuddles's suggestion). Check out this link: https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/sat  Best of luck, I hope you are successful in your endeavour."

GetStudying,3e3g7q,tigerskitty,2,Wed Jul 22 03:52:33 2015 UTC,"I did the SAT's, without much prep. I'm a Malaysian student, so doing the SAT isn't common, and I was essentially on my own. I got a pretty decent score, almost 2300, and this is how:  1) Practice tests. Getting a good SAT score isn't so much about intelligence, but about preparedness. There is a system to these tests and once you've unlocked the system, you've unlocked the test.   2) Official SAT Online Course. I paid for this, and I do not regret it at all. It has practice tests, but also grades your tests, including the writing portion so you know just where you stand. I just looked it up and it's currently selling for $34.95 when it's usually $69.95 for yearlong access. You won't need to do the course for a year, I managed to complete mine within a month (which was exactly how long there was between deciding to do the SAT and doing the SAT for me.) Link here:https://satonlinecourse.collegeboard.org/SR/index.jsp  3) Have faith in yourself. There isn't anything they're going to test you on that forms part of a syllabus so to speak, except for mathematics. I hate maths and even I found the maths portion to be inherently doable with some practice. I got sufficient practice from the online course.  4) Relax!  5) I'm not sure how to help you remember how to study, but if there are specific things you need help with, feel free to private message me or even make another post. I feel like studying is something I've been doing for most of my life (heck, I'm a lecturer - I teach people how and what to learn for a Law degree AND I'm currently studying for the Malaysian Bar exams). What works for me may not work for you, but at least we would know because we tried!  Good luck. I'll be available should you require assistance."

I'm not bragging at all. I'm just saying that there are MANY other things that colleges take into account. Just do your best. I agree that reviewing the questions that you got wrong is an excellent strategy, but also know that there are patterns to SAT questions. Most of my friends that did well on the SAT exam told me that the key to getting a good score is not so much learning the material covered (because that can get overwhelming), but knowing enough of the material so that you can figure out each question based on the patterns you studied of the exam. I hope that makes sense.  Best of luck. I believe in you! P.S. 30 is not old. It's only too late when you're dead."

Reading up before hand makes lectures feel more like review/digestion sessions as opposed to ""frantically trying to copy down everything the lecturer is saying without understanding"" exercises.  Review lecture material before bedtime on the same day. Bite-sized review sessions like this help you with longer-term memory retention. It's like brushing your teeth, you so it everyday so that it doesn't build up over a month requiring a root canal procedure. Start homework the day it is given. You don't have to finish it, you just need to start. Chances are you will end up finishing it way ahead of time. Exam revision is not just re-reading or re-copying lecture notes. You need to be practicing past year exam questions and redoing your assignments with the solutions covered. All in all, think about the long term goal, but don't overwork yourself. Start with one thing (don't try to do everything at once, you might become overwhelmed and then demoralized the moment one item slips.)  if you are ever procrastinating, tell yourself that you will just spend 5 minutes on it.

Not necessarily, but reading is a good habit to have and could improve your literary skills a bit. Wake up and sleep at a set time, establish a morning routine that you can stick to (i.e. getting exercise, shower, breakfast done before the time you would normally go to school during the school year).  Study more. Do your homework. Playing video games all day. Not doing your homework. Study. Do your homework.   You could always check out what subjects you're taking this upcoming school year and get a headstart on those? I know it might not be feasible for some subjects but for others it could be.   Overall your question is pretty vague so I think you need to think more closely about the issues you face and then come up with solutions to face those. e.g. if you're not motivated to do homework after a long day at school, wake up at 5am and do 1hr of homework every day before you go to school. You can start practicing that now by finding a personal project to work on for an hr a day and doing that at 5am."

GetStudying,3dpvf5,rdzzl,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:34:10 2015 UTC,"Ditch motivation, develop discipline. As you get older there will be a lot of shit that you have to do that you REALLY do not want to. Jump onto the discipline train early.   Summer is fun time; have fun. Start limiting when you're a couple weeks out of school resuming. This will be a test of your discipline. Reading books is good, preferably non-fiction for what you want to achieve though (personal preference). Read. Apply 3. See 3. See 3."
GetStudying,3dq20h,rockercaleb,6,Sat Jul 18 09:44:15 2015 UTC,"Here's what I said to someone just the other day about the SAT: I'll tell you what helped me get from a 29 to a 33 on the ACT, same should work for the SAT. When you do the practice test, look at what you got wrong and WHY you got it wrong. These tests are based on patterns and if you do enough tests and follow through like I told you to, you'll start to see similar mistakes and tackle them. Best of luck!"
GetStudying,3dq20h,thekillinapill,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:04:56 2015 UTC,"What he said. Both forms of test often have similar questions that have the same basic problem. (Like you could have 3 questions about their ,there, and they're). If one kind of question trips you up and you figure it out how you can increase your score by a noticeable amount ."

GetStudying,3dq20h,idoescompooters,2,Sat Jul 18 20:46:48 2015 UTC,"I never took the ACT, I took the SAT twice. First time, I went in without any studying or even looking over a formula sheet. Nothing. In hindsight, this was just dumb. But I came out with a 1790.  Now, I was like, man, this is really not good... I wanted to do Pharmacy, and this is just not up to par.  I studied like hell. On my own. Bought and completed the Blue Book front to back 10 times. At that point it was getting monotonous, as I was getting perfects in math and writing, so I began reading scientific journals and NPR and other news to get as much information in and to be able to comprehend and regurgitate that information back out. After that, I scoured the internet for any practice tests that I haven't done already.  Come test day, 1 and a half years later, the beginning of my Junior year, I came out with 800 in writing, perfect essay, 800 in math, and 770 in critical reading.   If you really put your mind to it, I can see you getting close to 33, one point should be cake if you know what your mistakes were and just keep doing more and more practice tests. Seriously, practice makes perfect.   I thought I would never be able to break 2000s in my SATs, but I jumped nearly 600 points. Anything is possible. It all depends on how much time you have, and how willing you are to put all your energy in to studying. Be smart when you study. Only study what you need to study. And at the end, study everything. It's a technique that really worked for me."

GetStudying,3dq20h,McLifty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:45:12 2015 UTC,"Take a crack at the SAT if your college of choice allows it. Not saying one is easier than the other, but sometimes, people just tend to do better on one than the other. Some of my friends couldn't get above a 2000 on SATs but got 33-34 on the ACTs. I was just better at the SAT, I took a few practice ACTs and for some reason, I just could not go past 31 (highest score after 3 practice tests)."

GetStudying,3dmkf4,ordnance1987,2,Fri Jul 17 18:39:14 2015 UTC,Spaced repetition is the phrase your talking about. I dunno which chart you need but Googling that should find it.
GetStudying,3dmkf4,vilemuse,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:36:40 2015 UTC,It's about what works for you. Whether it's reviewing what you've done recently every 3 days or every week depends on how often you think your courses need revision. Definitely recommend anki.

GetStudying,3dk3b7,thekillinapill,2,Fri Jul 17 10:29:22 2015 UTC,"Hey dude,  The SAT is not about how well you know the information. It's how well you know the test itself. You'll start seeing patterns and the same type of question after a while.  Think of it as grinding. It's not fun, but you need to do it to pass this stupid test. I went through 3 practice tests a day when I was studying.  Just go through full tests as much as you can. Use all 10! It's actually really helpful, especially if you go back and check what you got wrong.  Good luck! :)"
GetStudying,3dki93,ESPNnut,2,Fri Jul 17 00:27:05 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you value. If you really strongly prefer ebooks, hate carrying books, and have no desire to try to sell them yourself, then ebooks might be best for you.  As for cost efficiency, I'm going to call bullshit. You can flip your textbooks on Amazon for 3/4 of the original purchase price (as long as it isn't a custom edition... which you shouldn't buy anyway). If you ""rent"" it for half, you have nothing to show for it at the end. It's penny wise and pound foolish. One of my textbooks this year I bought for a fiver ($75 new online). Try that with an ebook.  IMHO it's really not that hard to carry textbooks to class. Just bring the ones you're going to work on that day (you're just going to hurt your back if you keep lying to yourself about studying all of the books all of the time). You'll have your own locker at the gym anyway if you want to keep that freshman 1550 at bay.  Plus physical copies sometimes have the solutions or highlighting already done for you. And you can always haggle for the price or return it once you realize that the prof added it to the syllabus for no goddamn reason.  Pro Tip: Don't buy the book until the class starts. Ever.  Pro Tip 2: International editions. Find it. Read it. Treat yo self at the end of the semester.  Pro Tip 3: Ebooks aren't only available through the publisher.  Pro Tip 4: Make friends in the second year of your program at the social functions (clubs, faculty meetings, whatever). The right ones will sell them to you for cheap or just give them to you. Networking ftw.  Sincerely, recent grad."
GetStudying,3dki93,studder,2,Fri Jul 17 01:43:05 2015 UTC,Both works. Try one of each to see if it makes any difference for you personally.
GetStudying,3dki93,rdzzl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:11:23 2015 UTC,"They probably work out about equal in terms of cost efficiency. Perhaps a mixed solution could be good to start off with and see which works better. Some things to consider:   It's not good for your eyes, or your sleep, to be staring into a screen all the time. If you are using your ipad for leisure and work, that will involve a lot of screen time. Being able to quickly access any textbook you've ever bought, as well as the internet, with one lightweight device is immensely useful On the other hand you can take a book to the park or the beach and not worry about getting your expensive bit of kit damaged or stolen Since you have already bought the ipad, you might want to make good use of it. This can be a double edged sword though; make sure you're not throwing good money after bad"
GetStudying,3dki93,l_lecrup,0,Fri Jul 17 11:19:10 2015 UTC,I'd go for textbooks because they're easier to read and you can sell them for some money back after you buy them.
