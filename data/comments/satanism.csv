I guess I can always make one up myself or something, but didn't know if there was already rescources out there I could build off of.   In its last section, ""The Satanic Bible"" has the rudimentary ritual information that you should first read up on, and ""The Satanic Rituals"", as one can infer from the title, expands on this drastically, providing instruction for a copious number of super fun rituals. I believe there are also rituals available in certain other books like ""Infernalia"".  Something else to read up on is ""Chaos Magick""; it bears many similarities to Greater Magic (particularly the secular variety). While this is hardly a requirement, a broader understanding of certain concepts never hurts.  If you feel more inclined to make something up on the spot, so be it, but you will probably achieve better results after achieving a more consummate understanding of it all.  Personally, to answer your other question, I do not do much Greater Magic. Don't find it necessary in my life.  Edit: additions"

satanism,3dtwnj,kami_nl,6,Sun Jul 19 12:40:06 2015 UTC,"My take on this one is that feelings towards greed ultimately comes down to the individual. Satanism merely states that it's not wrong to be greedy, it's in fact human and often times lead to satisfaction. Sometimes though, it might be wise to evaluate whether appearing greedy to others is desirable. This actually applies to a lot of things, that so-called ""sins"" are not wrong but do have consequences."
satanism,3dtwnj,Darius314,3,Sun Jul 19 13:22:35 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much what I was going to say. In my interpretation of the LaVeyan view (which is the closest ""religious"" association I have ever been able to agree with and loosely follow in my day to day life), I believe that he is basically saying that greed is not necessarily bad. With that said though, it does not openly state that greed is good, but simply that it is not an outright ""sin"" like other popular religions openly state. I think the key is a balance, obviously it isn't good to be totally greedy, however at the same time it is important in life to actually reap the benefits of your work/effort (i.e. get value out of your possessions that you have earned instead of giving them up for the sake of others)."
satanism,3dtwnj,giygas73,5,Sun Jul 19 15:15:29 2015 UTC,"I'm an atheist too. In fact, LaVeyan Satanism is an atheistic philosophy. You should know there is no god of Satanism. It is about what you make of it.  Anyway, it all comes down to you. You're probably a sound, logical individual; you know avarice is natural and healthy. The question is, ""to what extent?"". That is for you to decide. Besides, living yourself and making yourself happy without harming others, there isn't much else in satanism. You must make your own standard for greed, and to what extent it is justified in your actions. That can be up for debate.  Hopefully this helped. Have a good day, and Lucifer bless :)  Edit: Yes, the last sentence was sarcasm"

satanism,3dtwnj,Invisible-War,0,Sun Jul 19 20:40:18 2015 UTC,"I should rephrase what I said. LaVey doesn't care about who you love.

His conception of love is altogether different and tied to rational selfinterest."

Everyone I am associated with on a direct personal level knows what is up. So much so that I have done minor rituals and prayers in front of them, and it has never been a problem. The friends of my real friends who have problems with Satanists just never come to my parties, so I have even less incentive to hide what I am. Most people, when they see what you are actually doing, are far less militant about it and become more tolerant. They usually will wonder why you are a Satanist still, but see it relatively harmless.  Professionally, I just never mixed Satanism with my work anyway...

I don't care if people know, but I don't really actively go out of my way to broadcast the fact. I don't say I'm a Satanist, because I don't think I'm really what most people would conceptualise as a ""Satanist"". If someone asks me directly what religion I am, I'll assess whether I think they are sincerely asking out of genuine interest, or they're just making small talk.  If they appear genuinely interested, I'll ask if they want the long version or the short version. Short version gets my standard response of "" vee believe in nothing Lebowski! NOTHING!"" as I think nihilism is probably the closest thing most folks would recognise.   Long version is an interesting chat about belief, religion and the work of RAW, and why I relate to the idea of a satanic/luciferic deity.  If I think they're just making small talk I just say whatever bullshit comes into my head.  I'll add that I live in the UK, and religion is not such a hot button topic as it appears to be in the US.

It is ""No"".   All (half jokingly) sarcasm aside, there is nothing wrong with asserting yourself and voicing your discomfort with certain situations. It might feel a bit awkward at first even, you may think you've been rude, but this is largely due to the societal conditioning that we grow up with which makes us feel guilty because we arent comfortable with denying someone something even if it makes us uncomfortable.   You are here, in the Satanism subreddit. All forms of Satanism, theistic or atheistic have one common feature- namely, that it rejects the submissive norms of society and religion. It is entirely alright to let people know that you dont want to go to church, and that it's none of their business why; or that you don't want to partake in a ""spiritual guide"" training as you have your own spiritual beliefs.

There's quite a bit of that Santa Muerte worship in the neighborhoods I've lived in and in the West Hollywood area. But the thing is, it's all understood to be a business. You pay a guy to put a curse on someone or to gain wealth, and it's done... kinda. Need blessing? They'll pray to Jesus. Need money or a curse? They'll pray to Satan, whatever, just make sure your money is on the table. It's a big racket, and the documentary makes that pretty clear. These towns a pretty poor, so they depend on the tourists that come looking for witches and magic. Each ""high priest"" tries to out to each other, each one just throwing in more and more saints, demons, devils, symbols, costumes, etc. from whatever sources, doesn't matter. It doesn't make any sense really, but the tourists don't care, they just want a big show, and the peasants are desperate and just want anything that can help them. The film also mentions how they'll extort people. Hey, Satan has a curse on you... 500 pesos and I'll lift it. Done.    And that's the real Satanism in all of this.

This milestone will be celebrated with an all day “Festival of Arcane Knowledge” followed by a Devil’s masquerade party. The exhibition will be comprised of a blend of historical, “Outsider”, and Visionary art, as well as contemporary works, vintage books, vernacular photography, folk sculpture, spirit photography, and many surprises. As with previous exhibitions curated by Stephen Romano, the design and content of the exhibition will be in constant dynamic motion throughout the course of the exhibition, adding, taking away, reflecting the synergistic relationship the curator has with the collection.    This exhibition is composed of works from Stephen Romano’s esoteric personal collection, as well as works sampled from the collections of associates and the inclusion of some of the most highly respected and recognized contemporary artists of our time including Kris Kuksi, Kymia Nawabi, Martin Wittfooth, El Gato Chimney, Rithika Merchant, Pulu Zhao, Rene Allain, Matthew Dutton, Lizz Lopez, Joseph McVetty, Barry William Hale and Hunter Stabler.    The exhibition examines the place the visionary occupies as the ""HYPNAGOGIA”, defined as the experience of the transitional state from wakefulness to sleep: the hypnagogic state of consciousness, when mental phenomena such as lucid dreaming, hallucinations, and sleep paralysis occur. This “threshold consciousness” phase is in this exhibition linked with the visionary artist’s creative process which empowers the artist with shamanic powers. The works presented are implied to have been created while the artist was in a similar state of heighten awareness through their own pursuit of creative fulfillment."

When I joined it was out of respect for LaVey, Gilmore, and the work of other Satanists I was in contact with. From there our relationships grew and I've been involved in a variety of projects, some public, many private.   First of all, it's not all that high for lifetime membership to an organization. Many religious and secular organizations charge continuous dues that quickly surpass $200. Secondly, the price is a barrier to entry. We want it high enough to give people pause and really think about it, but low enough to be reasonable for a successful person.    We are not altruists, our time is not without value and we find the membership fee to be a small way to be compensated.      If you feel that the fee is too high but want to say thanks and contribute something then there's the donation button on the site. We're not a proselytizing religion. We're not looking for the masses. Think about it, otherwise we'd be selling memberships for cheap at $25, posting sponsored ads and spreading the good word of Satan!

Nepotism pollutes the integrity of any organization and replaces it with mediocrity as a rule if history means anything. What harm would there be in allowing the members of the Church of Satan pick the pope? Ahh, I bet you caught what I did there didn't you... :) If this is an organization why are there not elections for offices for which the membership can determine usefulness and qualifications? Why does CoS run like the Roman Catholic church? Hell, it's worse than the Catholic church in that at least for them when the pope dies a family's influence is over and some type of democratic process begins -- even if it is just via a bunch of cardinals.  Christian's have plenty of idiots to petition their organizations, and bandwagons rarely go anywhere but off a cliff. So I'll wait here patiently with popcorn in hand... I've been catching up on my Agents of Shield, and suddenly wish I had the ability to create pinpoint earthquakes. ;)  I'll give Gilmore a little credit in that he is much smarter in actually dealing with media than LaVey. I still ultimately feel that CoS is a lot smaller than we are led to believe and maybe the party line isn't as unanimous as put forward. It is almost as notable as to who has left the CoS vs who currently is a member. :)"

satanism,3c8xpx,Invisible-War,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:18:40 2015 UTC,"You're right... LaVey Satanism is a crude fascist type philosophy with all of its trimmings, e.g., replace ""The State"" with ""LaVey Satanism"" and ""nationalism"" with ""alien-elite/meritocracy garbage.""  What if we just replace ""Council of Nine"" with ""SS"", and ""Order of the Trapezoid"" with ""Gestapo?""   Anyway, we know how decisions are made in fascist systems -- from the top... And, that is the head cheese not some silly councils... Can a Council of Nine or the Order of the Trapezoid unseat Gilmore? I find it doubtful, hence my comparison. It doesn't really bother me because I would never be fool enough to be subject to their decisions in any way. I was mostly pointing the questions in an attempt to derive a forthright explanation for others who might actually give a fuck about how CoS works before they get involved.  Democracy can exist just fine if you actually believe that something is Satan -- we can walk individual paths, but unify for common goals. Democracy is really about having the freedom to make the choice, and apparently choices aren't present in LaVey Satanism anymore.  As far as people leaving for personal reasons that's of course an understatement -- it isn't personal when it's dozens of folks leaving for the same reason. I can see this structure as being rather inflexible and annoying to anyone who honestly wants to contribute in an active way since their work largely won't matter...

Sure, abide by your fetish I suppose. I wouldn't do that myself though.    The Council of Nine is the ruling body of the Church of Satan. Do with that as you will. Every board has a chairman. Can a chairman be replaced? I suppose, if the person running it turned out to be a failure. Guess what? That's not the case. Far from it. Here's some facts, in Gilmore's time as High Priest he has conducted more interviews than in LaVey's lifetime. He has multiplied membership (especially internationally, half of the interviews sent my way nowadays are with European journalists and writers) and fostered critically important relationships with academics, journalists, entrepreneurs, and freethinkers. When people look back at Magus Gilmore's legacy, it will be of one where he turned down the stereotype of the black-clad morose Satanist who's all talk with no real accomplishments. If a member attended the Year 50 Conclave they would have seen this in action, as our presentations were more along the lines of TED Talks than spooky posturing.    Dozens? You do realize what dozens means right, multiples of 12? I could probably count on one hand somewhat notable individuals who left in the past 10 years. And half of them would hate each others guts. Maybe a bit more if we extend it out the 15 years that Magus Gilmore has been the High Priest. People tend to forget that, like this some kind of recent development that they're still trying to come to terms with. Get over it, especially if you don't consider us relevant to your own beliefs."

I guess because I'm in the age of the internet and online is my go-to for research and information, I encountered so many under the umbrella for 'x-satanists', mostly being atheistic or theistic, but with a few extending out past into stranger sounding concepts. I don't judge, it isn't my place, but I see now that it may become a clouded pool of user specific concepts and ideology.   I've heard that phrase before, 'Do what thou wilt', and all I did know was that it didn't mean 'do what you want', but now I'm fully aware of it's truer symbolism and I feel better for it. I will remember this always.  I need to hit my local book store and do some serious reading for sure though. Thank you again for all of the info. I really appreciate it.   Question if I can: In your own opinion and yours alone, do you believe or agree to the idea then, that there is only one ""true"" form of Satanism to be practiced? Or at least, if any extensive, a limited number of ""forms""?  edit: a question"
satanism,3c4xq8,Invisible-War,3,Mon Jul 6 00:39:57 2015 UTC,"Yes. I recognize Satanism as the carnal religion and philosophy formalized by Anton LaVey and publicly represented by the Church of Satan. I have not come to this conclusion through ""faith"" or arrogance, but by thoroughly examining all other attempts to redefine the term Satanism by theists and other atheists. ""Theistic satanists"" lack the cosmological and theological coherence to be taken seriously as a metaphysical belief system. A first year student of the Torah can wipe the floor with any writer of ""theistic satanism"". And recent attempts by atheist activists to take a couple of aspects of LaVey's ideas and incorporate them with a collectivist form of Secular Humanism has proven to be little more than a game of politics. I get it, they need mass appeal to gain political traction so they need to drop all the dangerous elements of LaVey's work so your friendly neighborhood liberal won't run screaming. I'm comfortable referring to such efforts as neo-satanism. This is similar to Wicca being recognized as a form of neo-paganism, but not an actual pagan religion."

I feel I can keep this for reference and always look back to it no matter what I come to.
satanism,3c4xq8,Invisible-War,-3,Mon Jul 6 05:50:01 2015 UTC,"The reason there are two types of Satanism is LaVey made one up after choking down copious amounts of readings and stealings from Ayn Rand, Nietzsche, Redbeard, and more. Anyway, ""Do what thou wilt"" is from Sir Frances Dashwood's Hellfire Club motto, and his club was about as satanic in the real sense as you could be and not get lynched in its time. The club was largely aristocrats whom got together and did satanic rites, but as soon as they went home they pretended to be Christians. Crowley adopted the term for Thelema, but it has nothing to do with its origin which lies with the first case. I have never heard of a theistic using this term and have only heard it used by people whom identify with Thelema.  From a theistic perspective, LaVey uses Satan as a prop and it seems pretty silly even when I explain it to other people whom know not a thing else of it. Many folks today whom call themselves LaVeyists display traits similar to Islamic fundamentalists in regard to the way they talk or act. Satanism is this or that, and we are the true voice of Satanism, etc.. Please.. You aren't fooling anyone with a freaking brain in their head. I've seen your silly speech patterns in every other fascist on the planet.  As far as personas... How many of you supposedly real people use your real names in affiliation with Church of Satan? LaVey isn't a real name, and Nadramia isn't a real name. Is Gilmore a real name? I don't know... How about Nemo, Frost, or whatever? As far as I can tell the only person using his real name was Michael Aquino and he left.  Moving toward theism.... Theistic Satanists cultivate a direct relationship with Satan and that relationship may be toward a force, a being, or even a part of themselves that they feel that connection with. (It varies somewhat on the abilities of the person...) They worship (or rather honor) this connection and consider this sacred. They are for science, inquiry, pragmatism, and are the way they are through exploration. Most of us probably start as LaVey Satanists and then grow up or we have experiences, which skeptical outlooks say shouldn't be possible, but nonetheless occur.  Without rigid adherence to The Satanic Bible a LaVeyist is an atheist who wears black clothes and devil horns. You are still a sheep if you are a black sheep. Theistic Satanism is the far left of the left-hand path; we walk our own way. Satan isn't our master, but like our big brother and someone to respect or learn from. But, it is a self-guided tour and isn't for those who needs someone to tell them how to be or how to think."
satanism,3c4xq8,Marnsson,3,Mon Jul 6 23:21:28 2015 UTC,"I do wish more people used Dashwood's ""Fais ce que tu voudras"" or kept the original carnal, Rabelaisian understanding of the motto. Unfortunately the co-opted use by Crowley (rhymes with holy, not crowley, that rhymes with fouly) is mostly the nonsense I deal with.  Since you ask, yes, most of our Priesthood use their real names, and for all members it's a requirement to register with your legal name. How they wish to publicly present themselves is up to them. Let us list the real names... LaVey, Gilmore, Nadramia, Slaughter, Rose, Sprague, Bonner, Paradise, Campbell, Gray, Antony, Waytz, Mitchell, Harris, Williams, Cassavaugh, Baddeley, Palmer, Moynihan, Byrd, Gausten, Broderick, Filan... And those are just a handful of our public representatives. Yes, Aquino used his real name, what did that get him? Years of abuse allegations and getting processed out of the Army. Sorry, unlike some Muslims we are not interested in martyrdom.   As for the rest of your commentary, I'll let others judge rationally."
satanism,3c4xq8,momastic87,2,Tue Jul 7 04:05:05 2015 UTC,"Dear xChrisx,  In my opinion, Satanism (or Satanic) can be both something that you are and something that you do. It can be a religion/philosophy to build your values on, and/or can be the practice of providing opposition, asking questions and being critical (at times to a fault). Generally, though, it is understood to be a philosophy of life affirmation and viewing the world and universe with yourself as the center (which obviously does not mean you can't put importance on other things or people). At any rate, I think Satanism is very compatible to mix with other philosophies and religions. I see no reason why you could not combine it with Wicca, Buddhism, any form of paganism, Taoism (as Cosmic Mariner stated earlier) or really anything. I suppose you could even pull something off with Christianity and Islam, although you would most probably veer towards the gnostic sects, since they would be more compatible than the cookie cutter variants used by the masses. So really, Satanism goes as far as you are willing to take it. Theistic, atheistic, non-theistic, pantheistic, panentheistic, etc. etc. etc. is simply the preferred flavour of Satanism that works for you. I would view such an attached paradigm in the same way as I would view a religion or other philosophy attached to Satanism. It is something that makes the bare bones philosophy more palatable to a person. Although Satanism at its core is useful, it may not per se connect very well with a person, because it lacks a certain aesthetic. All (or at least most) of us use, and in a sense need, symbolism and allegory to work with things pertaining to philosophy and even psychology to make it compatible with ourselves. Where you take that symbolism from is entirely up to you and the amount of the connected philosophy you let seep through with it is also up to you. I suppose this also goes the other way around. I see no reason why anyone with a different philosophy wouldn't be able to use parts or symbols of Satanism to enrich their experience of their chosen path. I understand some would call it hypocrisy, but I would argue that it would depend on whether it was done to escape the dogma of one's chosen belief or to enrich their worldview.  On your other questions, I come from an atheistic background and during my adolescent years chose to identify as Asatruar (Norse/Northern European paganism). Then followed another period of agnosticism and atheism, until I sort of rolled into Satanism through study of the Norse god Loki. I'm not particularly sure where I stand at the moment. I still draw a lot of inspiration from the Norse pantheon (as well as the Greek). Although the philosophical core of Satanism agrees with me, the Judaeo-Christian aspect of Satan is alien to me, because I wasn't raised Christian and haven't had much contact with it apart from reading about it. Because of that, I find my concept of Satan more strongly in the aforementioned Loki and the Greek Prometheus, as well as initiatory gods of various mystery cults (Dionysos is an obvious example). I add to that Jung's (and mostly Pearson's, as it seems to me more systematic) archetypes to round it off. Because of the sliding scale character of my philosophical 'journey', I can't exactly tell you how long I've considered myself a defacto Satanist, but let's keep it somewhere between five and ten years.  Kind Regards, Marnsson"

satanism,3c2o85,Mancato,7,Sat Jul 4 04:55:59 2015 UTC,"In a nutshell: Satanism is a religion and philosophy based on rational self-interest, indulgence, and a glorification of material and carnal elements.    To the Satanist, his or her only responsibility is to acknowledge yourself as a carnal beast with an evolved ability for self-identity, therefore to identify yourself as the God of your own subjective universe. In order to achieve that godhead, your base carnal needs need to be met. To this, the Satanist views himself as an individual, with his own will first and foremost. Satanism is the most radical form of individualism. This is bedrock, everything else in Satanism is built on this very principle. And this isn't an arbitrary thing LaVey just through in there because he felt like it. This is the most basic principle of all Left Hand Path traditions: to not only reject God, but to become God. So if a Satanist recognizes himself as a god, and what good is it to be a god other people your equal? If so, then how are you a god? You need to deliver the good. That's where stratification comes in. Satanism is a brutally honest understanding of who people are. Some are predators, some are prey. Some are strong, some are weak, some are smart, and some are marks. It's not wrong or right, it just is. The Satanists recognizes this and uses it to their advantage. And that's why ideas like equality and egalitarianism are inherently incompatible with Satanism. Not because we have some fetish for authority, but because without it you have no self-deification and contradict everything else that follows. So exploit your strengths and to acknowledge and mitigate your weakness in order to live a fulfilling life. That's applied stratification, that people are not blank slates, and we play the genetic hand we're dealt.    Why am I a Satanist? Because that's who I am. It's innate in the way way I live my life and how I understand the world around me. I take the title of Satanist because anything else would be hypocritical.     I honestly don't have too much of a problem with Christian followers, mainly because they are on the decline. My problem are with who I call ""secular"" Christians. People who reject Christianity's theology, but accept and propagate the moral and collectivist teachings of Christ. People who say, I like what Jesus was saying but I don't dig creationism. That's pretty much what I get from most Secular Humanists, and even some activists groups today who operate under the guise of ""Satanism"". We must speak for the downtrodden and oppressed, they say. Sounds like they're just trying to out Good Guy the Christians at their own game (Proverbs 31:8)."

I have reproduced a couple experiences afterword. Some could argue that I'm just subtly conditioning myself to hallucinate. But I've never had as many ""spritual experiences"" since. This in time solidified my decision to call myself Satanist.   What I really enjoy above all is the philosophy I've plucked from various sources and arranged for myself. However they all boil down nicely to one statement for me.   Good and evil are but only concepts. You can argue all day with me but you can't prove they actually exist. Pain and pleasure however are tangible. Long story short something happens to people when they gather and actively participate in ritual reflecting this philosophy. The feeling produced rivals a drug induced euphoria in my experience."

All human beings are children of her. A different definition was taught to me as a child - regarding the definition of the Lilum - According to Catholics (at least my grandparents), all humans are Lilith's children which is why we pagans have the dirty stain on us put on to us by those dirty Jews. It wasn't until I came to America did I learn that the gracious 2nd Vatican Council cured us of the sheeny curse so we no longer need to blame them unless you feel like it then just call yourself a traditional Catholic."

It's only until later christianity where hell is condensed into one place instead of sheol, tartarus, and hades that you begin to see the personae of Satan shift into the more modern Devil.   Satan represents the Adversary. The Well Spoken Mysterious Gentleman. The Rebel Chief. The Destroyer. The Tempter of Mankind. There's endless writing on him, more than Lilith has ever had. Not to mention all these archetypes are built up on Satan and they empower us, or at least me, rather well.   You also mention how Lilith would be a better symbol, because she fucked up Gods plan more. But if your only point is to be a monkey wrench (the only positive thing you've said about Lilith thus far) you're probably looking in the wrong group. Most Satanists I've talked to tend to like order and planning...just y'know, their own.   You also take the time to ask us a question in order to plug Lilith, or your beliefs, as ""better"" with little explanation as to why. It seems a little disingenuous and as far as better goes frankly, thusfar I'm not seeing it.   Now, all of this is completely ignoring the fact that Lilith was not the creator of man, she got kicked out in Apocrypha for not wanting to be adams fuckdoll. This is fine. She then goes out into the world, until two angels come to her and tell her to go back. She decides not to, tells them to fuck off, and in some translations, becomes the mother of all monsters.   That is pretty great lore, but that's also like 85% of the Lilith myth, so if you're looking for an archetype with depth, I don't feel that's it."
satanism,3c2jse,NeophyteByte,-2,Sat Jul 4 15:33:00 2015 UTC,It's all a myth anyway so I have no problem with that. I'm pretty sure my grandparents were taught the story of Lilith from their priest or church since childhood since they didn't like Jews very much.

(Yes, I think I am slightly masochistic.. :)  Anyway, unwilled possessions are probably not possible unless the person is maybe already extremely gullible or not fully in control of their mental faculties. Achieving the trance-like state required takes nearly all of ones effort and cooperation to complete. Even at that juncture the operator (or in this case what is commonly called the 'horse') having any fear of this would likely be enough for it to never happen. Nothing stops a good invocation like fear...  Yes and yes.. as far as your question... We theists often do this to experience demonic energies or even Satan himself directly. Theistic Satanists like to have a direct experience of their god as opposed to trusting others.  If a Christian claims possession -- they have no understanding and they are full of shit. Please see the psychiatrist at earliest convenience. This process is difficult and requires a great deal of mastery to achieve."
satanism,3belj3,mindmaster064,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:26:45 2015 UTC,"@mindmaster064 - thanks for answering.  If an unwilled possession happens, how do you get free?  Also, do you know anything about committing the biblical unpardonable sin and whether that makes any difference to a person's susceptibility to be possessed?"
satanism,3belj3,mindmaster064,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:13:29 2015 UTC,"Well, I am not a believer in the Bible or any so-called sins being that they are created from morally ambiguous and subjective rules anyway. If you really think about the Christian sins there is virtually no way you can avoid doing them, so in that case I would say that all people are equally ""sinned"" if we were to compare. Thus judgments like good and evil are arbitrary -- they only have real meaning in comparison to something we experience ourselves. Things are either good for us or bad for us, but really we know no other measure... Thus, I say the Christian conceptions are very arbitrary and don't take into account the situations at hand. Killing can be good in some sense if you are saving someone from harm or stealing can be good if you are left with no choice and would die without food.  As far as unpardonable sins the only one that sticks is blaspheming the holy spirit. Since the notion of this holy ghost is pretty sketchy in the first place it seems peculiar to me that it is particularly important to avoid trash talking the holy specter. However, I made sure that I did this a few times in my life just to affirm I had no interest or ability to ever be saved so in case some priest said some last rites on me and I was drugged out of my mind I couldn't be saved even accidentally.  (Not that I am sure what we are getting saved from, but it's kinda like you not wanting your last rites to be performed by a Satanist...)  Ones view and beliefs certainly don't matter with the ability to be possessed -- it is a skill and it must be learned. It isn't easy, and it takes dedication to the task. And then, it's still only done in a useful context with beings that one already has trust over. You are really letting them into your spiritual house, and you don't let people you just know by name to have that closeness... These are things done after great amounts of trust are built between both these beings and the person in question. As I said, the likelihood of accidental possession is near zero. Ones offense to the religious denomination of your choice has nothing to do with how likely this is to occur.  Personally, I have worked with demons and angelic beings and generally the demons are nicer where the others are quite douche-y and condescending. All I can say is look at your bible and compare what the angels do in the OT and then realize that you never actually will want an experience of these creatures... They are ultimately probably very nasty no?"
satanism,3belj3,mindmaster064,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:42:13 2015 UTC,"@mindmaster - thanks - actually the unforgiveable blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is attributing the miracles of Jesus to Satan, so although you may have swore at the Holy Spirit you wouldn't have committed the ultimate sin in Christianity. I've read online that you have to get them to leave by the power of the Holy Spirit - do you think that's correct?"
satanism,3belj3,kazoodles,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:42:00 2015 UTC,"No, your belief in things have no say. Will believe your house is safe from robbers keep them out of your house?

It is impossible to use ""souls"" as a currency. :) Belief isn't a magical tool... ability to wield magic and sorcery is not belief... Belief is a nice way to say ""pretending."" Spiritual entities don't care if you like to pretend...  Personally, I don't think anything that in the Bible except for a very small subset of things that I can see in the history of other cultures exist. That includes Jehovah, Jesus, and Holy Spirits. None of them will actually come to your call like Satan or demon would because none of those things are actually names.

satanism,3aqqcm,ryallen94,5,Mon Jun 22 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"First, take into account that LaVey was incredibly eccentric and theatrical. So a lot of it is just him being himself.  Atheism and spirituality are completely independent topics. Atheism is simply the lack of belief in any sort of god. So spiritual atheism would be feeling a connection to the universe or something larger than yourself. Not that there are powers, forces, or a destiny, but the solace you can find in realizing that we a speck of dust in an infinite universe (or multiverse if you swing that way)  The rituals are meant to help you release stress and balance yourself emotionally. There isn't a god or a higher power, but we still need to keep our emotions and desires in check, and rituals are one way to do that. LaVey just happened to enjoy turning it into a spectacle,"
satanism,3aqqcm,magicnerd212,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:43:38 2015 UTC,"Well yeah i understand Lavey was pretty theatrical and its a shame because thats one of things that turns me off Hes approach to the whole Religion/Philosophy. I understand that the rituals and ceremonies are an outlet for emotions and all that but he often refers to the many names of Satan, and the ""infernal names"" to call upon during a ritual. That seems strange even for theatrical purposes to do something that makes no sense for an Atheist."
satanism,3aqqcm,magicnerd212,4,Mon Jun 22 20:56:00 2015 UTC,Rituals are a time for emotions. Logic and reason tend to go out the window during these times.

The one who admits that tarot cards and yarrow sticks are powerful tools, even if they're only psychodramatic. He chose the Infernal Names because they have always been associated with man's carnal nature, which white-light religions have always been afraid of, and therefore demonized. But we love our carnal selves, so we take those symbols with pride."

satanism,3aqqcm,mpizgatti,2,Thu Jun 25 21:37:19 2015 UTC,"It doesn't make it less real. It doesn't make it a universal reality though, I suppose. Anecdotal evidence is great on a personal level, but to truly know if something is correct we must test it scientifically. Scientifically proven ideas can be repeated by any capable person and the same outcome will arrive each time.  Same with all religion though...  It's fine if God speaks to my neighbor. I know that's nothing to do with what we know scientifically and that most likely my neighbor is a complete idiot or has mental issues. I don't want to speak to that person."
satanism,3aqqcm,mpizgatti,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:29:07 2015 UTC,"A few years ago i would of completely agreed with all that you said, but now id consider that a very narrow, close minded view. I mean i could get into a philosophical debate in about how subjective reality is the only ""reality"" because everything me and you know about the universe  is based upon the electrical signals being in-putted to our brain, meaning that if i saw and truly believed in a spaghetti monster deity, then of course it is real... because it is real to me. universal or objective reality is simply a collective of subjective reality's which are constantly changing and are open to interpretation.  Also it is very naive to say that just because science cannot prove something, then it does not exist. All that you know for certain is that with the current tools that science has to its disposal that science cannot prove it. things that science can disprove however is more accurate.  For example when 'Newton' (i think it was) discovered gravity he was initially labelled insane or a witch because he was talking about invisible forces, but now its of course a commonly accepted theory proved when we explored space. So you can see that science is slowly growing and doesn't stay still, theories get proved and disproved by other theories all the time and we learn new concepts of reality meaning that in the future things we would consider the supernatural of today may be the science of the future."
satanism,3aqqcm,mpizgatti,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:42:49 2015 UTC,Right. Newton. How many people throughout the ages said that there were ghosts or other silly things that have not been proved once?  Believing in what we can determine to be true with logic and reason is in no way naïve as far as I see it. Everything even philosophy can be proven with logic and proofs. Take a look at the writings on Universal Preferable Behaviors as an example.
satanism,3aqqcm,mindmaster064,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:31:36 2015 UTC,"I understand that but what I'm saying is we cannot simply dismiss something just because we cannot prove it at the current moment.   I think You misunderstand me I think science and great, I'm actually a very logical person and its with a logical mind where my theory stems from.   If you need another example look at science 100 years ago if somebody said other universes and dimensions exist they would of laughed at you and called you crazy like how you do with people who claim to see ghosts. But now the multiverse theory and other dimensions are commonly accepted theorys amongst physicists.  This is pretty much synonymous with what spiritual teachers and occultist have been saying since ancient civilisations. Also quantum physics has shown us that we know very little about how reality really works and we are constantly learning new things.  Is it really that out there with what we know now that 'ghosts' or other entity's exist and we simply haven't got the knowledge or tools to prove it, just like before ?"
satanism,3aqqcm,low_flying_aircraft,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:42:38 2015 UTC,"It really doesn't matter who has said what for years. That lends no credence to the thought process of believing in unprovable things.  You CAN deduce some things logically, but you still need those logical proofs instead of just anecdotal evidence which is, really no evidence at all.  I get the thought. It's indeed amazing that science has come this far. Most of what makes up quantum mechanics and the multiverse theory is speculation and guessing. There is a good probability of other universes from what I gather but no more than us existing inside of a computer program on the scale of current knowledge. It doesn't help us either way until it's further along the path to actual fact. The thought that certain religions or beliefs thought that there were other dimensions really holds no relevance to whether or not science decides that there is. People will always believe silly things, odds are some of them will be right some of the time."

satanism,3aqqcm,mpizgatti,8,Thu Jul 2 23:20:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, and no.  The original Satanists weren't Satanists, but believed in Satan. These were the old British Hellfire Clubs... They considered themselves things like men of letters, gentlemen, and Christian. But, nothing of being a Satanist. They performed satanic rituals, and the black mass. They worshiped, and they debauched... They partied pretty hard in the Devil's name.  LaVey comes along and creates a spooky occult group who meets at his home and this group becomes the Church of Satan. Initially, they do magic with the desire of trying it out to make it work -- and they never really do. They are either too high, too drunk, or just not very dedicated. So instead they decide it is rubbish and magic is like mental masturbation. More likely than not none of them had developed the proper skills. At least in my opinion... Anyway, despite this oversight this is where Satan becomes a symbol because they lack the ability to figure it out themselves. Which personally.. I support.. if you can't know then admitting only what you do is a wise choice.  Theistic Satanists still exist, and are doing fine but they're not the pop Satanists or the cool-kids Satanists. They spend years and years on a personal quest to understand and actually experience the nature of Satan vs what people say or think. In that regard it is pretty pragmatic and logical vs the silly styling of others who seek to demean it due to their limited understanding. (Most of this coming from the LaVey camp...)  In many ways, this is the far left of the left hand path... You do not accept LaVey's musings for anything more than entertainment and put your boots to the ground to find what you seek. I respect LaVey, but I think he gave up when all of this became work."

satanism,3aqqcm,Dedli,2,Tue Jun 23 13:33:41 2015 UTC,"As a vocal Satanic atheist myself- absolutely. Atheism is my ontological basis. Satanism is my epistemological position or philosophy on life. Satan is not Evil. Evil reinforces a ""good"" seated in belief. The Satan or The Adversary of belief is Reason. Knowledge. The ability to question and challenge. That is compatible with both an atheist position and a Satanic philosophy."
satanism,3aqqcm,NeophyteByte,2,Tue Jun 23 11:24:31 2015 UTC,"It's right there in the Satanic Bible. Satanic Magic is based on carnal, materialistic applied Jungian psychology, aesthetics, geometry, hypnosis, mnemonics, and a bit of the unknown. At its most basic level it's psychotherapy. At more advanced levels it can be something more, but still carnal and within the realm of flesh, muscle, and electricity. None of this requires God, gods, demons, spirits, etc. But the terms are useful for stimulation and creating ritual Total Environments.   ""Satanism, realizing the current needs of man, fills the large grey void between religion and psychiatry. The Satanic philosophy combines the fundamentals of psychology and good, honest emotionalizing, or dogma. It provides man with his much needed fantasy.""    Right there as a foreword to the Book of Belial: ""What good is a study of falsehoods, unless everyone believes in falsehoods? Many, of course, DO believe in falsehoods, but still ACT according to natural law. It is upon this premise that Satanic magic is based.""    ""The definition of magic, as used in this book, is: ""The change in situations or events in accordance with one's will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be unchangeable."" This admittedly leaves a large area for personal interpretation. It will be said, by some, that these instructions and procedures are nothing more than applied psychology, or scientific fact, called by ""magical"" terminology - until they arrive at a passage in the text that is ""based on no known scientific finding"". It is for this reason that no attempt has been made to limit the explanations set forth to a set nomenclature. Magic is never totally scientifically explainable, but science has always been, at one time or another, considered magic."""
satanism,3aqqcm,johnnywatts,2,Tue Jun 23 17:42:40 2015 UTC,"Suggested reading:  Google the term ""psychological decompression chamber"". Many treat their ritual area in this way.  I personally do not perform formal ritual or believe in magic. It's a psychological benefit to let off emotion. You can then think clearer and approach the problem in a better way to get what you want. If for some reason, your thoughts influence the world, all the better but don't hold your breath.  Lesser magic is of course, a form of manipulation and appearance to get what you want. Aesthetics and appeal. This works wonderfully.  Yes, some of those who were more inclined to believe in the fluff went to the Temple of Set and other bs spiritual movements... If they could be called that."

satanism,3a0s0w,Baphlingmet,8,Tue Jun 16 09:35:10 2015 UTC,"Since it's my cake day I figured I'd tell a story.    A few years ago I was in the military, during basic training there was a standard layout of our cubicle space and a daily security check.  The daily security check was done by senior staff of the recruit school and had to be initialed by everyone on the floor. These things are important to note.  Part of the layout was a space for our bible, we were issued one.  I decided since all my docs listed Satanist as my religion that I'd put out my own bible as others who had brought their own had done.  Mine just happened to be The Satanic Bible.  Fast forward a few weeks and one day the security inspection sheet had ""satanic"" written in the comments section that was normally used for things like ""locker unlocked"" or ""dirt on floor"".  I refused to sign it.  My refusal to sign the security sheet got me a meeting with the company commander.  He brought in the master seaman(MS) who wrote the note on the security sheet.  MS was a Navy clearance diver, boarding party member, pushup champion of the recruit school (174 consecutive pushups), marathon runner and all around scary dude.  The interaction with the MS went like this:   MS: No church gave you this  Corvin: Actually MS, a church did, The Church of Satan  MS: Fine, I'm going to go talk to the Padre and see what he has to say about it.  Corvin: Please do.   A couple of days later orders came down that the layout was changing, there would be no bible to be left out as part of the layout.  A week later the company commander did his inspection and noticed the lack of bibles out on layout.  The MS came up to me after a class and asked to borrow my bible.  He returned it the next day telling me that bibles were going to be part of the layout again, or no bible for atheists and Torahs and Qurans would be allowed too.  He then told me that if anyone had a problem with my bible or my religion to send them to him.  I later found out that MS was dating the female Protestant padre."

I wear only black shirts, crosses, pentagrams, spiked bracelets, and the such. I dress like this daily (I'm a graphic designer in my company, so workplace attire doesn't apply to me), and I dress like this for gigs I attend or play in. I've never felt I needed to dress up ""proper"" for church, so I dress the same way there. My church is very accepting and liberal (in non-theological terms), and my cellgroup sees me as the ""funky"" one. A lot of people do ask me why I dress this way, and I explain that it's just a style I enjoy (and I only like wearing black... I look weird in most other colours). But they've been civil, and I've shared about what Satanism truly is when they ask whether I'm a goth/Satanist/occultist, instead of the typical sacrifice babies/goats/virgins thing. It leads to a lot of constructive and sometimes intellectually-stimulating conversation, and I've come to enjoy that very much. Plus, catching how people look at me from a distance is pretty damn amusing. And their reactions when they get to know me don't hurt. Also, as the only person wearing a pentagram to church, I'm pretty well-known, so it's not a shocker for most people in the church who know me.  Honestly, I'm very attracted to Satanic philosophy. The Satanic Bible remains one of my favourite reads, and I agree a lot with what's in it. However, I also read a lot into Christian apologetics, and while I do have doubts here and there, I think the case for Christianity can hold its own. So I remain a black sheep in church."

A fictional character from folklore. Belief in Satan is as laughable as belief in any other deity.  Following Satan is wrong. Following is wrong. Don't be a follower. Satanists aspire to be leaders.

I do get that though, from a few friends and family. ""If you're an atheist, why do you call yourself a Satanist?"" It's tough to explain to those types. Satan is the ultimate adversary, and I very much liken to those qualities. Plus it helps identifying as ""religious"" in cases where a ""religious preference"" can work for you, such as the case with the Satanic Temple (to which I am a member) fighting Missouri's abortion laws using the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  (you're being honest) Grow a brain stem, perhaps try out this awesome thing you may have heard of.. Google? doubt it will do much good, because you sound like an idiot. I'll try and help though. The majority of Satanists are not theistic. That is, we do not believe there is an actual Satan and worship him. Hell (hah) even those on the theistic side, generally view him as a deity of sorts, not even associated with the Judeo Christian religion."

We all have our experiences, and just because someone doesn't agree with them doesn't change mine. :)  As far as Christian atheists... it sounds like even more of a load of shit... :) LaVey Satanism is like very passive-aggressive to me. It's like making Satan a prop at a school play and then pretending after that play it's ""just a symbol"" and that we will just keep pretending we're at that play still and dress up in our silly clothes for the rest of our lives.  The irony that LaVey Satanists use the mythology of this Christian view of Satan as the basis for their ""statement"" against the dogma they despise, but have merely defined themselves as being an inverse of the Christian belief in entirety including the misotheism. But, there is a difference in researching the nature of these things and simply believing in them  or immediately judging them all false and I take the first approach. I don't give two shits what LaVey or anyone else who doesn't even bother to try has to say about it. =) This is why I am where I am and not a LaVey Satanist any longer.. though I was in the past..  I would venture to say most people grow out of LaVey Satanism naturally.. it's just too polarized to really be realistic."

satanism,39vxqj,DJEJ6656,3,Mon Jun 15 06:07:21 2015 UTC,"A lot of hate goes to JOS for a lot of reasons, the biggest one is probably the plagiarism. The thing about plagiarism is it means it's a copy, so not everything you'll see there is false, before I get downvoted, I DO NOT support JOS, but as a quick reference and beginner guide, it can be useful, as some of it is plagiarized (a copy), of legitimate works. With many meditations, you'll experience oversleeping, personally, I experienced insomnia, insanity, hot flashes, and hallucinations. The hallucinations though may not always be hallucinations, as a Theistic Satanist, you will have to condition yourself to tell the difference between what is real, what is in your head, and what is hallucination. At whatever point you feel comfortable, you could start creating your own meditations, experimenting with different breathing techniques, thought processes and forms, whatever it is you feel drawn to. What I would highly recommend is looking into what JOS has copied from, and studying that work, as it will be original, and 'more' legitimate. I've tried to answer your questions and I hope I can help. Message me if you want to ask more questions and I'll do my best to answer as straight forward as possible."

satanism,39s6tb,nihilistic_apathic,7,Sun Jun 14 06:14:36 2015 UTC,"I've been very interested in drug culture and am fairly biased against it, but mostly so by what LaVey had stated when I was reading The Satanic Bible.   I don't know the exact quote but it was based around the fact that a lot of hallucinogenics and mind altering drugs take oneself away  from the one heaven and the one hell. Earth. I avoid them for the sake of keeping a clean record and not relying on another drug as a crutch. Especially something recreational. It also does not interest me in the way that it does others, as there are so many other ways to go about it.  If you are very serious about quitting, don't tell yourself and then betray yourself. Make a pact. Keep a promise. Find another hobby to take up, and throw away all drug paraphernalia. It will be both a time and a money sink, but over all will be healthier for both the body and mind, given the right circumstances. Hopefully it also acts as a drug and you find something you like enough to take you away from the world without actually needing to.   Even more so, it makes you well rounded. Learn a new trade or craft. Try leather working, or what I do, fountain pens, calligraphy, paper making, hell, write a book. Make it interesting enough to make you WANT to do it rather than just when you need. IE; cooking. It's a hobby sure, but there isn't much of an impetus if you can get McDonalds for 20 cents.    That's just my advice, and I hope you take it, I can't say I want a drug free world, but recreational drug use isn't a big one on my list. It needs to be legal for those that need it medically. Other than that, the system needs not be abused by addicts. Soon, if that works, we may find other drugs legalized and worked to better humanity instead of being correlated with (drug here)heads and deadbeats.   Good luck friend, and of course hail satan."

Just start breaking the habit, if you absolutely are fiending, get the shit out of your house for awhile, others suggested hobbies and that's a greatly useful tip, taking your mind off of things will help a lot.   I use a practice when I find I'm indulging in something to often. You deny yourself what you want until you've  thought of and forgotten it on three separate occasions throughout the day/week/month. What you need to do is work on building your willpower.  So, for instance, you want to smoke? Don't. That's how you don't smoke weed every day. It's a choice, and you might not like it, it might feel like shit because lets face it, weed is a great pick-me-up, but fear not!

I am not looking to get married.  Your alignment determines what stuff you can do during the campaign. Christianity to me is chaotic evil, they worship someone who doesn't exist, they pray and force this shit on their kids, and they force it on others through proselytizing. Technically they are Chaotic good. Lawful good would be like your nice people that keep to themselves. Then you have neutral this is like agnostics and atheists. Satanists are lawful evil, but in our eyes we are lawful good. Satan is nothing more than idea. A philosophy. Satanism to me is simply me living my life to my own benefit. I meditate, dabble in the dark arts, I use magick, I call upon help from demons and I ask Satan for things. I light candles, celebrate Halloween and my birthday. I think muslims are chaotic good. Or lawful good since they follow their own law. Jews I am not sure. But the cool part about D&D is that you can create a character that follows a deity and has an alignment that matches what that deity is about. This is how you get extremists.  Satanists that have read the books, and are educated see themselves as good people. Christians give us so bad of a name that to this day people are taken back when we declare our deity. Most satanists say they are spiritual but not religious. Which is new age which is against the christian dogma.   Allah, the deity, God, Yahweh, Jehova are all the same god. They all have hell to send you to if you are bad. Satan runs hell. Satan wants you to be happy here on Earth since there is no after life. There isn't life after death so you should live everyday to the fullest and be grateful for that. Or not you are free to do what you want."

satanism,39eq6u,Seraph_Grymm,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:20:41 2015 UTC,"well Satanism (non-theistic) is more of a philosophical belief than a religious one. I'd say it's entirely possible to be agnostic and Satanist. If it works for you, why not? Depends on how you want to look at it, I guess.   as /u/Invisible-War said    We do reject the idea of gods existing as conscious independent supernatural entities, but we do accept ourselves as gods of our own subjective universe."
satanism,39eq6u,Invisible-War,9,Thu Jun 11 15:28:07 2015 UTC,"The Church of Satan is a ""functionally"" atheist organization. I say functionally because we do not disregard the idea of god altogether but we operate as if there were no governing supernatural deities. We do reject the idea of gods existing as conscious independent supernatural entities, but we do accept ourselves as gods of our own subjective universe. This isn't a small thing, it is the basis of the entire Satanic philosophy. It's what ties LaVey's philosophy to the Left Hand Path tradition, the idea of self-deification, but instead of occultnik spiritual mumbo jumbo, we fulfill this through mastery of carnal existence."

Anyway, any individual approaching Satan containing Satanism (lol, funny I have to specify this) initially starts with whatever conception of Satan they can understand. Sometimes that is a principle, a force, or a literal deity with all of the associations. You have to ask the question of yourself whether it is there or not and investigate for yourself.

satanism,399mjd,DJEJ6656,3,Wed Jun 10 06:32:43 2015 UTC,"1.) Interest and fascination for death and misery in all it's forms since I was a child and an admiration for Satan from that time as well.  2.) Satan is a entity that exists outside of this world and is one and the most powerful adversary against YHVH. On earth the Master acts as a force and is able to bring destruction to Assiah and offer guidance and knowledge to those of Fire. He acts as a force by driving people to commit suicide, murder, drug abuse, pedophilia and other immoral things. He has existed before time.  3.) In my experience, I have prayed to the Father, asking him to, for a lack of better a word, ''show'' me something the coming days that happened in real life the following 1-2 days.  4.) Yes, magic does exist. It is outlined in many books, though I recommend to do it according to your own beliefs. Satan has many forms in which he conveys his power, you'll have to choose the fitting ones or create to destroy yourself.  5.) The Bible, Qu'ran, Tanakh and other holy scriptures are very cryptic and can be mistranslated very easily. The human mind, good or bad, is very diverse and view things differently basically."
satanism,399mjd,anticosmicdawn,2,Fri Jun 12 20:56:27 2015 UTC,"1.) What caused you to become a Theistic Satanist?   I have been one off and on since childhood. I was raised Pentecostal and originally just thought the Satan character was more honest, more beneficial to humans than ""God"". I've never been part of an organization, and though my understanding of Satan has very little Christian influence at all now, that was basically how it all started.  At 13 I did my first ""dedication"" ritual. I went atheistic for a bit from about 18-22, I felt that I just wanted normalcy and pretty much just walked away from religion. Then came back much more seriously in the last 5 years. I now view the Deity as akin to Apophis, Arhiman, Prometheus, Iblis, Lilith, the Horned God, Set, Hadit, Babalon etc, rather than just the ""Satan"" of the christian tradition.   2.) Who or what is Satan?  Do you think he objectively exists?     Yes, as an energy, force, or consciousness. Not in the form of some goat headed anthropomorphic character. He is, in my view a Deity, or an aspect of ""god"" that manifests itself of it's own free will. The point of working with him (or it) would be to evolve and potentially do the same ourselves.    3.) If you (for lack of a better word) talk to Satan or demons, do they tend to say things that are accurate (for example, you ask Satan about a future event and then Satan tells you what will happen and the event happens exactly as Satan said it would)?   Yes, I don't ask about future events often, but when I do, I usually ask that they be illustrated with tarot cards. I keep a notebook so I can look back and keep myself honest. I invoked and asked about returning back to school last year, and everything pointed to failure and bad timing, it was suggested that I wait. I scoffed and went ahead with my plan, I mean why would education lead to failure? Well, I barely made it through the summer session before a health problem kicked my ass. Caused me to quit school and cut my hours at work. I'm just lately (a year later) finding relief, so yea, I think the cards were pretty dead on about suggesting I wait. I threw money down the toilet and put myself in a worse position by going back when I did.   4.) Do you believe in or practice magic(k)?  And if so, how does it work?   Yes, I've only been working with magic more recently, but I started with chaos magic and then branched out into using traditional witchcraft as well. I think (and this is just how I've come to view it so far), that it's a way to grab threads of energy and direct them, I think that's basically what correspondences are.   I'm also beginning to think that if you ask for the Deity(s) assistance, it will manifest through others who are also connected to that Deity. It's like there's a channel there and the energy or Deity runs as intermediary. This must have something to do with human consciousness, but I don't claim to fully understand it yet.   5.) Why do you think different Satanists view Satan differently (i,e some view him as an angel, others as a Pagan god, others as an energy)?   Well, I think that's as it should be. This path is individual, what I believe shouldn't be exactly the same as anyone else. And honestly, most of these definitions really overlap. I think the words used just depend on the paradigm, but we're all talking about the same essence. Also, from my view Gnosis or theurgy is the goal, and for that to occur depends as much on our minds as it does the Deity(s), so our minds in many ways shape how we understand it. Our minds are shaped by the society, culture, and paradigm we live and work within, so then also will be our understanding of said Deity."
satanism,399mjd,MsLilith,2,Wed Jun 10 17:08:44 2015 UTC,"Those are good explanations.  Thanks.  But for #4, what do you mean by energy?  Is this natural energy that exists naturally or is it demonic energy that you get from demons or something like that?  Like what is it?"
satanism,399mjd,MsLilith,2,Wed Jun 10 20:06:07 2015 UTC,"No problem, you asked interesting questions :)  I'd say it's both. Correspondences teach you to use natural energy, like in herbs, stones, moon phases etc, which exist naturally. But in my experience, the ""oomph"" comes when you open your mind up enough to sincerely try and experience or work with the Deity(s) or demon(s). I think it must do something psychologically and alter our perception.   I noticed that when I practiced chaos magic atheistically I still got results, but I seem to get faster, more potent, and more far reaching results when I work Theistically.   I think the ""demonic energy"" for lack of a better word is something different. It seems to be something primeval that is either able to bend the laws of nature, or function to some extent outside of them. But it's existence doesn't negate the success or power in other, more ""natural"" forms of magic. And of course any success still comes down to the practitioners mindset and intent, no matter the form of practice."

satanism,38sw18,Invisible-War,2,Sat Jun 6 18:29:38 2015 UTC,"The Church of Satan represents and advances the philosophies and metaphysics of Anton LaVey, as described in The Satanic Bible and his other works. This includes his ideas on magic, human nature, stratification, and applied science & technology.    A common misconception seems to be that TST is somehow a variation of LaVey's philosophy. They aren't, even though some of there early members were involved with the CoS in direct & indirect ways. But a close examination would show that their principles and tenants are very much not from LaVey, but are sourced from various Secular Humanist material. I've noticed that in recent interviews and press releases that TST has started to distance itself from LaVey altogether. People say that because TST is an atheist organization that they share that ""atheist"" platform with LaVey and the Church of Satan. That isn't accurate. We do believe in a force of nature that we symbolically refer to as Satan. We do not believe it's anthropomorphic or that it can (or care to) communicate with humans, it just is. Does gravity listen to the prayers of the passengers of a plane about to crash? We also do not believe a continued existence in an afterlife, but we are open to certain things that can be considered supernatural. I like to say we are ""functionally"" atheist and healthy skeptics. TST does not condone any belief in the supernatural at all."

There was this black guy at my university that was studying math and always looked slightly overdressed. One day we talked to each other and I asked him why he always looks like he is about to get to a job interview. He answered me that he can't stand all the hip hop culture and just wants to live a successful life. But people made always assumptions about him, so he decided to look like this because that way they wouldn't come to him and bring up a conversation about the latest rap songs or some other shit. If you look conservative enough, people will steer away from certain topics. His argument was: ""I can't influence what people think about me, but I can influence how they behave around me by looking like this"".   It made sense.  EDIT: I just remembered Stefan Burnett aka MC Ride from Death Grips. His tattoos and the lyrics of his songs certainly have a very satanic influence."

Much less for fear of social suicide (as I've given up on social cliques) but the sad truth that has already been touched on about religious conservatism (thanks /u/HurricaneAlpha).    Some people of color are so entrenched in Abrahamic and Ishmaelic belief systems that they feel the need to attack the unfamiliar passive-aggressively if not outright aggressively.  Often their dogma runs so deep that there is no reason to engage in conversation about faith and belief, or the lack there of, with them.  Most often they're neither ready nor interested in approaching hard questions or opinions in conflict with their own.      I once was at work listening to a woman go on about the ""goodness of god"" and how she didn't care what anyone's religion was because according to her we all ""worshiped the same god.""  Her conviction was as crippling as her limited scope of the realm of faith and religion.  While I cannot place fault on her for not reaching beyond what she was trained from birth to follow, I cannot justify wasting my time, or her's- or anyone's- trying to expose someone to something that they are unwilling to process.    Thankfully younger generations of the black community are more receptive to alternative belief systems and are breaking away from tradition for tradition's sake.  It's crippling.    I'll step off of my soapbox now.  EDIT: Grammar."

In much of the West, high socioeconomic status is anti-correlated with religious belief - in all of what we call 'the West,' high socioeconomic status is disproportionately enjoyed by whites. The Satanic Panic, the Christian moral conflicts of the Cold War, and the goth subculture were all constrained to predominately white countries until rather recently. The Satanic Bible was written in English. Etc.  In terms of cultural differences, you may or may not be surprised that demonology is an extremely taboo subject even among some enfranchised groups in the West (middle class blacks in Chicago would be my primary sample). It's one thing to be a skeptic or a sinner in a way which is socially normal, and another to fight against every norm ever instilled in you. If a Satanist ever says they came from a Baptist background, buy them a drink, because they are a serious motherfucker.  Then there's those Nazi idiots like JoS. Stupid people like to talk loudly and bad news has wings.  I don't know enough about true theistic Satanism to say something intelligent about them.  Something like twenty percent of Muslims are Arab and thirty percent are from the Indian subcontinent, and Islam is more than 1400 years old.

You can't claim to be part of ""the Elite"" if you're living in a cardboard box.  Moreover, Satanism is a religion that emphasizes self-actualization. You only need to look at Maslow's Hiearchy of Needs to see that self-actualization is the very last thing you can achieve.  Given that most minorities are poorer than whites (exceptions for Asians like myself), they're too busy figuring out how to put food on the table for self-actualization."
satanism,38el1e,SlyMuffins,-1,Sat Jun 20 09:52:53 2015 UTC,"There is a strong white supremacist current in Satanism/the occult, and vice versa.  This is because, like you said, Satanism (including LaVeyan Satanism) often makes use of symbolism and mythology from predominantly European origin, which leads many to believe that Satan or various pagan deities (e.g. Odin) are more traditionally European than Christianity, which they see as a slave-like religion imposed by Arabs and Jews on white people.  Satanism itself is inherently ""racist"". The very idea of ""racism"" (taking pride in who you are and where you came from, taking pride in your blood and ancestry, wanting to preserve your traditions and culture, wanting to live among other people who are like you and have the same culture as you) being a ""bad"" thing is an inherently Christian idea, which is why ideas like ""anti-racism"", ""equality"" and ""multi-culturalism"" only exist in western countries with a history of Christianity. The concept of ""xenophobia"" being a bad thing is completely absent in countries like Japan, China, Israel, Pakistan, etc.  The idea that pride is a sin is deeply ingrained in the psyche and culture of western society, because of its Christian history. Racial pride is considered the most egregious. We are brainwashed with guilt and told instead to be humble and accept the doctrine of equality, two of Christianity's main teachings.  I think it's funny that people call themselves Satanists and claim to be free-thinking individuals, but never DARE question the most taboo and forbidden subject of our time: the differences between races.  You tell yourselves that you're being rebellious and edgy for attacking Christianity, the safest possible target in the world. Attacking Christianity hasn't been edgy for 50 years."
satanism,38el1e,cc1945,3,Thu Jun 4 20:58:56 2015 UTC,"You're so foolish it's painful. Satanism is certainly not inherently racist, because races are demonstrably social constructions. We reject social constructions outright - our society is better than everyone elses', and it has nothing to do with our genetics."
satanism,38el1e,cc1945,-1,Fri Jun 5 03:03:01 2015 UTC,"Great argument. Simply state that I'm foolish and that race is a social construct. Two mere assertions without a single argument to back either one up.  ""Race"" is not a social construct. Race is not skin deep. Different ethnicities have different characteristics, and sometimes these differences are so pronounced that doctors often prescribe medications based on the ethnicity of a patient for the best results.  Just by looking at a human skeleton, we can determine its gender, age and ethnicity. This is how deep these differences run.  Race is ""demonstrably"" a social construct? Demonstrate it, then, because most scientists would laugh at your for even suggesting that. IQ tests have consistently demonstrated that blacks haver a lower average IQ than whites, and that whites have a lower average IQ than Asians and Jews.  In the 1950s in America, black people and asian people were both treated with the same racial prejudice and discrimination. However, despite the immense racism they both suffered, Asians have improved their wealth and economic status exponentially since the 1950s, whereas blacks have never been able to improve their situation.  Do you understand that if two different types of sparrow look absolutely identical, but one type has colour around its eyes, then that is enough for them to be considered two different subspecies? But human beings (human beings on the left) actually pretend that race is ""made up"".  You know what's really fucking stupid? Like, stupider than believing in Christianity and that evolution never happened? Believing that evolution did happen, but that every race, even though we are extremely different from each other physically and historically, and evolved completely isolated from each other and in completely different climates, all just happened to magically reach the finish line at the same time and be equals.  ""Black people don't have lower IQs, higher athleticism, and higher crime rates, that's just a myth!""  ""Asians don't score much higher than all other races in exams and get accepted to better colleges. That's a social construct, you racist!""  Do not be so outright hostile and insulting towards people like me. I have known many neonazis, fascists, skinheads. We don't ""hate"" other races. We don't want to hurt them or take away their rights. We don't want to keep blacks as slaves. All we want is a place to go where we are free to live amongst ourselves and practice our culture, free from the suicidal dogma of ""diversity"". We want to be around people like us and we want our grandchildren to look like us.   If you still have a problem with that, you should ask yourself why. Ask yourself if your thoughts are really your own, or if someone else put them there."

It's absurd to care what skin color your grandchildren have because you can in fact raise smart, healthy, wonderful non white children. Try not raising them in poverty, it works wonders.   And while people may take pride in their ancestors' accomplishments, they shouldn't be deluded into thinking of them as their own."

There are black geniuses and asian idiots, there are white gang members and Mexican school teachers. However, that does not change the average.  If it rains every day of the year except one in Chicago, then it would still be accurate to call Chicago a ""rainy city"". The exception of one sunny day would not refute that.   But that isn't the point. ""Racists"", as people like you call us, don't believe in hating, harming or otherwise mistreating people of other races. I have several acquaintances from school, sports, etc. who are black or dark skinned ethnicities, who I am fond of and whose company and conversation I enjoy. I myself don't believe any race is higher or lower than any other, only different.  I simply believe that a group that is comprised of people who are similar to each other biologically, culturally, and psychologically will function and advance much more harmoniously than a society of disparate groups who all have different values, different desires, different cultures, different behavioural dispositions and different goals. There is nothing evil about believing that, it's simply against the current status quo of a one-world, one-race, one-government ""utopia"".  A word on racial pride: like you said, it would be naive and ignorant to take pride in the accomplishments of one's ancestors as if they were one's own. Racial pride, however, is simply an acknowledgement of and respect for the long history of culture, traditions, wars and struggles of your ancestors that made your existence in 2015 possible, and are the very fabric from which you were created.  By your logic, one can't take pride in anything. If someone is a genius, they were born smart. If someone is beautiful, they were born good looking. If someone is an athelete, it's because they were born with exceptional physical capabilities. If you're going to take such a narrow view of ""pride"", you must apply it to everything. Using that definition, I can't even take pride in my immediate family, because I didn't choose them."
satanism,38el1e,Pussy_Cartel,2,Fri Jun 5 06:04:06 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this desire for racial inclusiveness.  Going beyond the arguement of whether purity or racial mixing is genetically better, I have an issue with the suggestive tone of ""I'm not interested in the history, culture or knowledge of any culture other than my own.""  Besides, (and I'm assuming youre American here), modern white America is a plethora of different European ancestries all mixed together.  So if youre accepting that your bloodline is a mixture of greatly differing cultures from the European continent, why is the idea of the mixing of cultures worldwide an issue?  You're handful of posts in this thread all scream one thing at me: fear.  When I hear racists like you (or ""seperatists"", whatever) justify you're archaic beliefs, all I hear is a fear of those different than you. To me, that seems weak and counterintuitive.  I still don't see how racism is inherent in Satanism, by the way.  If anything, Satanism holds personal accomplishments to the highest regard, and your race is the last thing that you could possibly claim as a personal accomplishment."
satanism,38el1e,cc1945,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:44:58 2015 UTC,"Yes it is fear. I am afraid that the cultures our ancestors fought and died to preserve will be lost because of certain political groups who are ideologically opposed to them.  Saying it is fear is not a refutation. Fear is a survival mechanism.   There's no real argument here. This isn't about not wanting to ""learn about other cultures"". It is a simple statement of the fact that a homogenous society functions better than a heterogenous one.  No, I'm not American, but what if I was? The point isn't what race you are, or where your ethnicity comes from. It is simply the principal of being with your own, and loving your own (whatever that may be), because it is a natural extension of self-love.  You probably don't think that people of Jewish ethnicity are racist for supporting Israel, a state that exists as a home for Jews to preserve their race, culture and traditions. But if white people want to do that, it's evil, because the western media says so."
satanism,38el1e,Pussy_Cartel,2,Fri Jun 5 11:15:52 2015 UTC,"IQ tests   You clearly don't know a thing about 'science' if you've not read up on the measurement debate around IQ. What IQ measures is arcane and impossible to name in anything but a descriptive way, and the consensus in psychology and anthropology is that IQ measures a certain way of thinking, and assessing value to that way of thinking can only be done within a reference frame. IQ is, for example, correlated with success in middle and upper class Western upbringings. This represents a teeny tiny slice of culture.  If you don't really know what you're measuring, then there's nothing you can say about why you measure what you measure. This is the correlation/causation distinction.   lack people and asian people were both treated with the same racial prejudice    Seriously, do you just say things you imagine about scholarly topics, or is someone feeding you this silliness? No historian I can think of would claim this remotely. Even those who would refuse to argue severity would argue the character of these things was different.   even though we are extremely different from each other physically   We mapped the human genome within my lifetime. Our physical differences are, statistically, very small.    Do not be so outright hostile and insulting towards people like me.    Insulting? I am doing you a kindness by informing you of your own ignorance."
satanism,38el1e,cc1945,-1,Sun Jun 7 00:53:22 2015 UTC,"You can make the argument that IQ is an invalid form of measurement, but it would be prudent to remember that the only reason IQ was ever questioned in the first place was because of the uncomfortable cognitive dissonance and questions it raised about race.   IQ is actually an amazingly accurate factor in predictions. For example, an ethnicity's average IQ is strongly correlated with how many inventions were contributed from people of that ethnicity. IQ is also highly effective in predicting financial success and crime rates, with high IQs leading to higher paying careers, and low IQs leading to higher crime rates.  All in all, IQ is a very useful and effective tool. But, unfortunately, it told us something our sensitive, weak minds didn't want to know. We learned that our cherished concept of ""equality"" doesn't actually exist in nature, and was invented by our society, based on our Christian morality.  ""We mapped the human genome, we are actually very similar"" what does that mean? Like what does that mean in terms of the discussion?   Does it change the fact that black people are 10% of the American population, but about 75% of the pro athletes?  Or that Asians have a similarly small population but also a similarly high over representation in college admissions?  Does it change the fact that black people feel more comfort and familiarity with each other and relate to each other better than they would whites, Asians or Hispanics?  Jim Crow laws were never even necessary for segregation. Go look at any school, prison, or a place where people are forced to convene together. Human beings naturally self-segregate. The whites sit with the whites, the blacks sit wih the blacks, and so on.  This isn't because of some sinister culture of racist indoctrination, or some neurotic fear of people different to you. It isn't because these people hate and want to harm each other. It isn't because one group is superior to the others. There's nothing scary about it at all. It is a simple, natural, healthy preference for the company of people similar to you than people different to you.  If someone only picked friends who were similar to them, you wouldn't see anything wrong with that. You wouldn't call them closed minded and demand they get new types of friends to ""enrich"" their experience. You would say that person is smart and is probably choosing friendships that will function in a healthy and lasting manner.  But if we apply this same basic, obvious concept to ethnicity and culture, everyone panics and shits their pants, because it terrifies us.  Political correctness is the irrational fear that if we acknowledge even one little difference between black or white, man or woman, gay or straight, then all progress will be lost and the human race will be plunged into a new dark age of eugenics, concentration camps, slavery and lynchings."
satanism,38el1e,Vanitati,2,Sun Jun 7 05:50:32 2015 UTC,"Trying to define race as a purely biological thing is hopeless because the phenotypes that make up so-called 'races' are too diverse and multifarious for us to even hope to quantify and delineate clearly.  Ethnicities as we know them have been mixing for thousands of years, and while we can point to outwardly similar appearances that are more common within some regions than they are in others, that doesn't necessarily translate into clear genetic links between outward appearance and actual performance in specific domains. As for finding a verifiable genetic source for 'intelligence', that's even more hopeless because intelligence is, ultimately, an aggregate of multiple capabilities that intersect and interact in various ways. IQ only measures a specific aspect of intelligence.  IQ isn't a sure bet for success or crime, either. The factors measured by IQ often translate into greater success in traditional Prussian-model educational environments that are favoured in our society, but performance in those areas is also contingent on socio-economic status and numerous other facets. Facets that also translate into measurable IQ gains and losses.  As for measuring the interaction between historical inventions made by 'races' and the average IQs of said races, I don't even know where to begin with the problems there. The factors necessary for an invention to be made include not just intelligence as an aggregate, but also access to resources, the time and specialization needed to allow people to tinker and invent, actually having a need that said invention would meet (which is itself particular to specific environments and cultures and time periods, not universal), and lastly, the culture would have to not encounter any other society or culture that already had the invention and shared it with them.  In short, trying to boil down invention and intelligence to matters of race falls flat because it means trying to put incredibly complex biological and sociological aggregates into grossly over-simplified boxes.  As a neuroscientist myself, I have no interest in intelligence as an aggregate, I'm more interested in the neural correlates of the actual functions we usually group under intelligence, such as problem solving, inhibition, language, and semantic memory.   And my success as a neuroscientist has nothing to do with my mixed Nordic/South Asian heritage. My accomplishments are my own, I don't need to cling to the remnants of some racial or national past to soothe my own ego."

Do you notice that you seem to be finding every possible excuse for black people, and trying to widen their margin of error every extra millimetre you can? Even by blaming education disparities on the ""Prussian-model"" discriminating based on economic class. Poor white people are smarter too. I myself lived in a trailer as a child and am now doing a degree.  You seem to push as hard as you can to steer everything you're saying in the direction of minimising the importance of race and nature over nurture, and making allowances for your own personal biases.

satanism,385xjp,dannopwnzu,12,Tue Jun 2 02:09:31 2015 UTC,"Conversion might be too strong a word.  I can speak only for myself of course, but for me Satanism is about empowering oneself from inside oneself - listening to your animal instinct. We have lost sight of undiluted human nature, and we dress it up and put on masks and pretend that that is what it's like to be a human being.  A human in touch with their animal instinct can be kind, loving, intelligent, fair, logical, loyal, forgiving, creative and happy. A raw human can make choices that give it certain responsibilities, and I feel it is healthy to work hard to meet the expectations of those who you have committed to, providing they are fair and moral. It's not subservience in and of itself. A good ethos for me is to do whatever I want, providing nobody gets hurt.  A raw human must also not be afraid to stick up for themselves, and perhaps a little controversially to have zero tolerance for those who seek to mess with your harmless peace. That's not to say you should go and punch your boss - they have a lot of pressure and responsibility, and sometimes you have to be a bit of a bastard in a position of power, as long as it's not in a corrupt way.  Forgiveness can be a good thing, but if you look beyond someones superficial behaviour and can see that they have a broken sense of morality then they may not be worth being diplomatic with. If they have a functioning adult brain and have used their intelligence to decide that being a cunt is how they want to live then they must expect to feel the consequences. This is tricky to judge, as they may have had a difficult upbringing that made them a certain way, but at what point should someone be responsible for making the choice to continue with a harmful ideology?  What I am saying is, for example: Somebody thinks it's okay to threaten you with physical violence in the street? Punish them.  Somebody hurts your feelings? Tell them firmly that that is not okay and you will not tolerate it.  The government tries to take away your freedom? Revolt.  You have an abusive partner? Leave them and tell the police if you are afraid for your safety, and are unable to protect yourself for whatever reason.  Somebody threatens to kill you and is likely to attempt to do so imminently? Destroy them.   This zero tolerance approach is magnified by the media, and is made out to be the sole function of satanism. It's not even exclusive to satanism! Honestly, this sort of thing doesn't become relevant very often, and day-to-day the open-minded, down to earth satanist is just a thoroughly pleasant chap/chapette."

Teach her empathy and kindness and how to take care of herself in every situation you can imagine because you won't always be there. Once she has grasped this coin if she so chooses she can flip it.  You can't just be good at lying you have to master it. One missed step and you lose all the trust and rep you have built up over however long you have known somebody. The goal is not to hurt other people, or for a cheap thrill, but to improve your position. Sometimes the truth accomplishes this even better (many people lie to protect peoples feelings).

satanism,37jyir,digmystache,3,Thu May 28 04:20:03 2015 UTC,"Most satanists I know would actually prefer there be a paid paternity leave to go along with it. (Or maternity, in the case of a lesbian couple) Having a child puts a couple (or single parent) in a financially vulnerable position. Most people would go broke within a fairly short time if it werent for such leaves. Besides, if not for parental leave, the amount of time one would have to take off from work would all but guarentee your job would be handed off to another person, leaving you unemployed with a new child."
satanism,37jyir,Face_of_Nyarlathotep,3,Thu May 28 04:56:07 2015 UTC,"""Wouldn't paid maternity leave be considered similar to a bonus or additional paid vacation?""  I absolutely think not. Being pregnant and caring for a newborn is, in no way, a life circumstance similar to that of a gay male who carries no responsibility of raising a child. Taking time off work because you're pregnant is not like taking an extended vacation."
satanism,37jyir,has_no_legs,3,Thu May 28 07:20:00 2015 UTC,"I think maturity leave in most cases, in countries/states that impose it from a legal/lawful veiw, do so for revinue and tax purposes.  If a working (tax paying) woman falls pregnant (creating a future tax payer) wouldn't it be a good idear to help them during their time of unemployment? This is normally at a cut/percentage of what they normally earn (in a lot of cases), then garentee they cannot be fired during this period (this period set by law) so they can return to work and pay tax once again.  This is not taking into account that there is still a surprising gap in wages depending ones gender, in ""developed"" countries (US, UK, AUS, etc.). So in your e.g. It's most likely your ""breeder"" is only on 80-90k.  Also in place, in some countries (again this is generally politically based) the father of the child can be entitled to paid leave once the child has been born, not for as long but also at a cut rate.  But then this isn't a free ride for anyone who finds out they are having a child, 'governments' normally have in place, that to be entitle for leave, you had to have worked for a set period of time before hand. (Maybe so you have paid most the tax you are now entitled to), and to make it more politically obvious, these periods are at about a year before birth.  I'm no expert on this topic, it's just an observation, hence not touching on if in your case, the male is gay. Other than that it is choice, if you choose not to have kids then you get what you put into it, if you chose to have kids then in some places in the world there is aid, but normally nothing is free.  There are a lot of factors to come into play, but depending on where you live & your circumstances, unless this is/has/will affect you, then troubling yourself in stiring up a debate is counterproductive."

satanism,372twf,ImpiousXIII,1 point,Mon May 25 06:19:55 2015 UTC,"Atheism and agnosticism are not necessarily incompatible. Most atheists that I know would not make the claim that they know for certain that there are no deities, just that given the evidence, their existence seems incredibly unlikely.   When you say    undiscovered intelligent non-human entities   it doesn't really bring to mind anything godlike (ie. omnipresent, omnipotent, etc though I know that not all gods of all mythologies satisfy those two categories). A non-human intelligent lifeform in the universe is much more believable, in my opinion, than an all powerful being that transcends space and time.   Now, will I make the claim that I know for a fact that those types of beings exist? No. Given current evidence, do I think they exist? No.  Atheism is a stance on belief in divinity whereas agnosticism is an epistemological stance on divinity.   I also think ignosticism plays an important part in modern agnostic-atheist thought, because there is no coherent definition as to what defines a ""deity"", therefore rendering discussion of it's veracity pointless."

satanism,36zpnt,johnnywatts,18,Sat May 23 14:42:13 2015 UTC,"First of all, judging Satanism by the people in online forums is probably not the best course of action. While many Satanists are on social networks, not all are, and the most successful of them either aren't or aren't open about their Satanism online.    Second of all, SIN consists of the bottom of the barrel ""Satanists"". They're founded by a reject who could barely hold a job and lives with his mother at age 40. And what you observed is what happens when you have no barrier to entry, you attract anyone and everyone who thinks being a Satanist is cool and spooky without any sense of quality control.    People complain about the membership fee for the Church of Satan and yet this is exactly why it's there. It's a real, material barrier to entry. If $200 is a struggle for you, then may you should reconsider joining an organization that supports a power and elitism philosophy. That's less than I spend on a decent night out with my wife or ammunition at the range with friends. Anton LaVey was all about results. He didn't care if you memorized his texts or practiced every ritual, he cared that you actually made a difference in the real world. And not just to talk about it, but show it by gathering wealth, power, and influence.    At the recent Year 50 Conclave we had several successful Satanists demonstrate their achievements, including lawyers, entrepreneurs, corporate executives, computer security researchers, environmental scientists, musicians, engineers, and university professors. And those are only the ones that are open and chose to present themselves. You won't find our Reverends holding ""gatherings"" at the parking lot of a metal show, you'll find them doing TED talks, producing critically acclaimed documentaries, lecturing at universities and events.  As LaVey said, water seeks its own level."

That's not always the case."
satanism,36zpnt,Invisible-War,3,Sat May 23 20:32:32 2015 UTC,"The only name I know attached to Citizenfour is Laura Poitras. When I searched ""Laura Poitras Satanism"" or ""Citizenfour Satanism"", I either get unrelated results, or sites that have both an article about Citizenfour and another about satanic child abuse. Who is this key person?  I disagree on a few things, and it begins with the CoS's refusal to recognize members of other Satanic organizations as Satanism at all. Given our common creed that is militantly individualistic in nature, I find it odd when the Church says, ""Ya know these other guys who don't think like us? They're fake/not Satanists"".  Yeah, I get it. It is the house that LaVey built, and him and his not-appointed successor can do whatever they want with the Church. It simply does not sit well with me that deviating from the Church's current ""dogma"" results in what is basically excommunication.  Not to mention the known theistic kooks that have come out of CoS. e.g., Aquino and Rex Church, both of whom occupied high positions within the Church before they uh..., retired to pursue the worship of an imaginary friend. So it's not just some random member I'm judging the CoS on. I have major respect for the work of LaVey. I just don't know if the house he built will come tumbling down with me in it.  Then there's the lack of evidence of successful members in an organization that prizes elitism and power over others. My thoughts on this matter is summarily discussed in another post below this one.  Finally, there's the abolishment of the grotto system. This basically guarantees that I will not be able to have an active role within the Church, since I live...oh, thousands of miles away. In any organization I join, I like pursuing active roles. Part of the whole deal about ensuring some semblance of competence in my life, etc.  Thank you for taking the time to write to me by the way.

Most of the time these people just want their own little fiefdoms to declare themselves Grand Master Flash over. This is why the grotto system was disbanded. Too many people joining the CoS only so they can dress up and fill a social void without contributing anything to the implementation of Satanism in the real world. All this leads to the very issue in your post, the image of a bunch of losers being representatives of the Satanic religion. Consider it a form of quality control. If that makes us look mean or arrogant in the ""occult community"", so be it, that ceased to be where we draw our most productive members a long time ago. We'll have no part of that rush to the bottom, even if it costs us potential numbers.   We do encourage individual members to get together at events or functions if they share goals and interests. I've been to and heard of such gatherings in Southern California, Salt Lake City, NYC, Vermont, Florida, Washington D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, and others.    Aquino's drama was almost 40 years ago. He held his position because he was beneficial to the organization and LaVey considered him a friend. When he left he took a lot of kooky baggage with him and that was for the best. Since then we've both moved on, the TOS no longer considers themselves a Satanic organization in any way. As for Rex Church, even he admitted in his open letter of resignation that he hid his Theistic beliefs from the COS, knowing full well that they contradict our philosophy. We went our separate paths and both are better off. He's free to pursue his activities without the need to hide anything, and we remain consistent with our philosophy. Don't see the big deal.  Here's LaVey on the failure of the Grotto system and why we don't pursue organized recurring social functions. People seem to think that this was something new with Gilmore, but it's not, it's been operating procedure for decades.    “I realized many people were joining our ranks simply because it was a guarantee of friends, or because they wanted glory of passing tests to earn degrees, much like the lodge hall ‘Grand Poobahs’ who take off their robes and vestments and become the local plumber again outside their lodge. They were getting more ‘spook-appeal’ out of being members of the Church of Satan than we were getting esteem from having them among our membership. As an organization grows, group activities only cause contention, drain vital energy that could be better applied elsewhere and eventually become counterproductive. Teaching people that they’re all right and society is all wrong, that the only ones who really understand them and that they can relate to are within the group, is damaging in the long run. It only reinforces their own inability to deal with the larger world. “That’s one reason why I dissolved the Grotto system. I wanted to create of forum, a loosely-structured cabal for the productive aliens, not misfits who need to depend on a group. After the re-organization, I was free to be more selective. I would much rather attract and lend support to those individuals who use their alienation – just as most leaders are usually different or distinctive in some way. Groups encourage dependence on beliefs and delusions to reinforce their omnipotence rather than applying magic on an individual basis, as The Satanic Bible outlines. Instead of fostering self-sufficiency and honest skepticism, I saw my group lapsing into blind belief and unhealthy anthropomorphism. That’s not what I intended and I had to make moves to get the Church of Satan back on track.”"

Except for one: Given the reasons for dissolving the grottos in your post, how does a new member of the Church of Satan go on to pursue the implementation of Satanism in the real world? Again, I live thousands of miles away from Hell's Kitchen.  On a related note, how do CoS members coordinate with each other? Any organization will need some common channel of communication, if not for weekly recurring social functions, then at least for specific functions like the Year 50 event."
satanism,36zpnt,P4PChamp,2,Sun May 24 09:20:17 2015 UTC,"You pursue the implementation of Satanism by being the best you can be in the areas of your own influence. Be it your career, art, or personal achievements amongst your peers. Set out to be a shining example of what the Satanic philosophy can accomplish when met with skill and force of will. Communicate your goals and your accomplishments with the organization and you may be pointed towards others who share your goals and interests. We have members who are writers who work with publishers, musicians who go on tour together, web designer who collaborate with developers, professors who tap the shoulders of academics and the insight of brilliant minds, entrepreneurs learning from one another. I personally recently hooked up a producer of a show who needed a musician to come up with a soundtrack.   We're realists and understand that the internet is the most productive and wide reaching way for our international base to coordinate with one another. Like I said, individual members are free to gather and get to know each other in person. We will hold some official gathering in the future, but we will decide how much to reveal to the public or even our general membership. Realize that we're not omniscient. People can apply to our organization, join, and be active but still be unstable or have some ax to grind without us knowing. For example, if we were holding a celebration for a high profile member, we'd probably want to make this an invite only event with members who've shown us to be trustworthy and interested. So if you join, keep us informed and we'll keep you in the loop."
satanism,36zpnt,P4PChamp,2,Sun May 24 22:44:39 2015 UTC,"As for evidence of successful members, I believe /u/Witch_Zaftig covered that well enough.

satanism,36zpnt,Invisible-War,1 point,Sun May 24 07:26:11 2015 UTC,"Satanism is all about individualism though. Why do you feel the need to spend 200 dollars to make it ""official"". Who are you trying to impress and why? What value does having their card give you?  Not saying I'm for or against it, do what you want (that's the heart of Satanism anyways)."
satanism,36zpnt,Invisible-War,5,Tue May 26 05:41:28 2015 UTC,"It's less about making it ""official"" than about moving forward with Satanism in my life. I've been a lone practitioner for years. I don't feel the need to make things ""official"".  By joining the CoS, my aim is to further the implementation of Satanism in my life, and thus gain power over others. From what Invisible-War claims, the CoS can serve as a repository of contacts to help me achieve my own goals. At the same time, obviously being Satanists, I help them achieve theirs. Fair exchange really. No free lunch etc.  Of course, there's always the possibility that what Invisible-War posted is a giant load of cow dung, but frankly $200 isn't much to me, and thus the potential payoff is well worth it."

satanism,36zpnt,Stabbytehstabber,1 point,Tue May 26 15:53:16 2015 UTC,"Different people have their reasons. Some want to tap into a network of like-minded individuals for their mutual benefit (as /u/johnnywatts states), others just want throw in their support for an organization that upholds the philosophy they believe in. We have many members who join just to say ""thanks for being around"" and never reach out again. We have members who never tell another person of their affiliation, and we're contacted after they've passed and a family member finds their membership card in a safe.     When I first joined the Church of Satan it was mostly to acknowledge the body of work that their membership has produced and the suppport that their members had given me. I was a concert promoter and I noticed that just about every other show I helped put on had a COS member involved, or that there were many COS members in attendence. I had long considered myself a Satanist and supportive of the organization and its representatives, so I thought it was time I paid the Devil his due.     Keep in mind, joining the COS doesn't make one a better or more authentic Satanist. It doesn't even make one a Satanist at all. It's about what you put into it, or don't. Like I explained elsewhere, the $200 is mostly a real, physical barrier to entry. We only want people who thought it through and really wanted to join. The amount is both high enough to warrant a second thought and low enough to be reasonable for a person with sufficient means."

satanism,36zpnt,bunbunofdoom,12,Wed May 27 21:29:04 2015 UTC,"As a ""failure"" myself, let me try to explain what sold me on Satanism.  About two years ago, I read the Satanic Bible for the first time. About a year and a half ago, I decided that I was a Satanist.  It was not about gaining power or authority at first, and it was certainly not about bettering myself. I have never had much in the way of ambition or empathy. It had a lot more to do with the aesthetic of dark humor and using sins as a method for obtaining physical, emotional, and spiritual gratification.  When I read the hilarious essay about using magic while sitting on the toilet, I knew LaVey was my kind of prophet.  I never wanted much in life, but I had almost nothing; I was working the night shift at a hotel making less than ten dollars an hour, and I hadn't received a raise in the five years I'd worked there. My girlfriend of several years had left me when I was unemployed for several months straight(I eventually ""fixed"" my unemployment by ending up right back at that damned hotel). I was living in a small room at one end of a trailer with my father and sister. My only vices, really, were books, cigarettes, and video games, because I couldn't afford anything harder.  I don't know if I can really blame/thank Satanism, but my life is in a completely different state right now. I got a job right outside of Washington DC working in a data center making almost infinitely more money than I was back at that hotel, and have been living up here away from my friends and family and life since December of this year.  To be honest, though, I don't want to be what you might think of as ""successful"". Invisible-War said elsewhere that LaVey:   ""... cared that you actually made a difference in the real world. And not just to talk about it, but show it by gathering wealth, power, and influence.""   And that's true, for what it's worth. But I never met LaVey, and I don't care much what he would have thought of me. He was brilliant in a way, but he was not delivering messages from a god. He was an intelligent dude with a sense of humor and a bit of a piss fetish. What I care about is my own happiness, and my happiness requires me to have as little responsibility as I can get away with. I do my job well, I get along with my coworkers, and I stay on top of what I need to know, but I will never get ahead in this company, because that does not interest me. I'm glad that there are people who devote their lives to their work, because if the world was full of people like me, society would crumble. I wanted a minimum level of comfort, and now I have it.  Shit like this, though:   If $200 is a struggle for you, then may you should reconsider joining an organization that supports a power and elitism philosophy. That's less than I spend on a decent night out with my wife or ammunition at the range with friends.   ... pisses me right off, but everyone feels the need to justify their lifestyle by presenting a philosophical argument as to why their way is the best way. If my only advantage were money, I'd probably claim that cash was king, too. Every group has elitists, be they rich or poor, powerful or weak, and most of them are simply ignorant.  I know I rambled a bit, but it seemed appropriate. I am literally one of the ""failures"" you were asking about, and I doubt that many other people will admit to being one.  TL;DR: I sought solace in seeking simple pleasures in life, and am slowly growing becoming less and less of a loser, but I disagree with many about the nature of Satanism."
satanism,36zpnt,JasonUncensored,2,Sat May 23 21:22:38 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I don't think you'd qualify as a failure if your original goal wasn't the betterment of yourself/your life. You can't fail in something you didn't even set out to pursue.  I think I'm mainly concerned about the failure aspect, because it is the Internet afterall, and people can choose to represent themselves however they wish. If they chose to represent themselves as total losers on the Internet, I cannot help but wonder what their actual lives are like.  In your case, you simply don't qualify.  I think Invisible-War has mostly satisfied my concerns, and I thank him for that. I'll be thinking about CoS membership over the next couple months, or at least until I find out how exactly membership works, how it benefits my life, and what channels are there for me to work towards benefiting the Church in return."
satanism,36zpnt,plonk519,1 point,Sun May 24 09:36:30 2015 UTC,"I really meant more of a loser than a failure, but the metrics are the same.  Honestly, don't worry about membership until you're ready.

If that struck a nerve with you, that was not my intent. What I was aiming at are those who keep harping that our membership fee is some kind of greedy con (any MBA can tell you we do not have a profitable model) and that their public forum with thousands of free members somehow makes them relevant in some way. Which leads to OP's issue. And what LaVey was talking about was in regards to people trying to impress him with all their occult mumbo jumbo and how they were some great Anti-Cosmic grand wizards but couldn't pay the rent, so brother spare a dime?  I know this makes some people uncomfortable, but money is a useful metric for success. It is perfect? No. But it works well enough to filter out the flood of garbage our kind of aesthetic attracts.    Your life story is not unusual for a Satanist, shit happens, you suck it up and handle your business. I'd be more proud of myself if I were you.

satanism,36zpnt,Witch_Zaftig,9,Sun May 24 00:00:51 2015 UTC,"Members of the Church of Satan are diversely employed: lawyers, physicians, military personnel, academics, porn stars, musicians, artists, plumbers, and electricians.   Just because they don't advertise and you'll never hear about them, doesn't mean they don't exist. It means they have decided to keep their affiliation secret in order to further their goals.   The idea that Satanists are all failures is something we successful Satanists laugh at as we continue to rack up accomplishments."
satanism,36zpnt,JasonUncensored,2,Sat May 23 18:27:29 2015 UTC,"See, I've seen this being said repeatedly. It's the standard answer from the Church of Satan. ""Satanists are everywhere. We're just secretive about our members"". Alrighty, fine. I get it. A lot of us cannot live life publicly as a Satanist without facing some backlash from our social circles. Yup, got it.  But as someone who lives in the mundane, and not the fantastical, taking the word of Gilmore on it is probably the last thing I'd do. There needs to be evidence. Saying there's a secret list of people who are all over society's ladder isn't evidence.  It's like that kid who insists he's got a baseball, but refuses to show it to you. At that point, the best course of action is to assume the kid doesn't have a baseball, and instead look for baseballs everywhere else (thus SIN, 600club, etc.)."
satanism,36zpnt,439052-3,7,Sat May 23 20:14:11 2015 UTC,"Satanism doesn't require martyrs. By that I mean, if divulging our affiliation could harm us, then we are under no obligation/pressure to do us. So the organization itself doesn't feel it's required, and members themselves decide for themselves.   So, we don't need to provide evidence. People seem to want it, which is understandable I suppose, but it's not something Satanists feel they have to prove to the world. Satanic philosophy itself discourages it, as it is considered foolish to try to convince the masses of our ""legitimacy."" A small portion of us seek to correct misinformation, but none of us care to recruit or have Satanism be acceptable to the population at large.   Accept the claim in good faith, or not. But I would still caution against using the Internet as a gage for Satanism in action. That's a limited view no matter which religion you're looking at."
satanism,36zpnt,Invisible-War,2,Sat May 23 20:37:43 2015 UTC,"I agree entirely that there needs to be evidence to support a claim, but the ""official"" stance of there being Satanists throughout society seems to come from a specific claim of LaVey's; he said that people with Satanic values are Satanists, even if they don't know it. I think it was in the first chapter of The Satanic Bible.  So yes, if by definition, your group includes every person who has worked hard and achieved greatness in their life, then your group will have members throughout society."
satanism,36zpnt,439052-3,4,Sat May 23 20:38:06 2015 UTC,"That's a misunderstanding of the claims. Let me explain.   1) LaVey was referring to defacto-Satanists, i.e. people that have clearly exhibited Satanic thought and action. Mark Twain is an example. No one claims he was a Satanist (the CoS didn't exist yet!), but many of the recurring themes in his books and letters demonstrate an iconoclast, antinomian perspective, with a keen eye on the folly of human behaviour. So a defacto Satanist simply means that their art/writings/work resonates and echoes Satanic ideas. That's it.   2) Gilmore's claim that there are members in all areas of society is NOT the same as claiming defacto Satanists. Gilmore is referring solely to Church of Satan members living ""Satanically"" in the world, here and now, not historically."
satanism,36zpnt,Invisible-War,1 point,Sat May 23 20:49:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the clarification, Witch Zaftig, but it still seems a bit ham-handed and juvenile to me.

It just doesn't seem to be in line with Gilmore's We're not out to hurt anybody message.  (And I enjoyed your appearance on 9sense recently!)"
satanism,36zpnt,Ave_Melchom,1 point,Sat May 23 22:06:49 2015 UTC,"I don't believe he ever intimated that people better ""watch out,"" but, even if he did, it's not meant as a threatening statement. It's meant to indicate that even if people dismiss Satanism as irrelevant, Satanists are already in the world achieving their goals. That makes someone's dismissal irrelevant to practicing Satanists.   And Satanists can and do have conflicting agendas. They fall on all different sides of political and social issues, so it would be difficult to claim that there is a single Satanic Agenda. Perhaps the only issue that Satanists agree on is the separation of Church and State, because it allows for private freedoms and public interests as a whole.   We are not out to hurt anybody. We are also not out to apologize. If we are a threat, it is to established norms and the status quo, not individual persons.   (And thanks! That was a fun exchange.)"

Calling it selfishness is just being objective about it. Because we value personal growth, we have a responsibility to be honest with ourselves.

I don't think there is such a thing as true selflessness, at least not in a sane person. I am a kind person. I help other people. I am a humanist. But I do all these things because I think that they make society better, and that's what I want. It's out of my own self interest. No matter how good an action, it still comes down to doing what you want to do because you like the result. Whether that means ignoring everyone else and being only self serving, or serving others because it makes you feel good to help others. It's all selfish.   Satanism is about recognizing the reality of the selfishness of our actions, and no longer pretending that selfishness is a bad quality that we shouldn't possess. The religious like to treat service, zealousness, etc. as actions that they have to sacrifice their own wants and needs to do what is ""right"", but they are still choosing to do those things because they want the reward, want to avoid the punishment, want to do what they think is right because it feels good."

Sure, there's some self interest involved in helping others. Maybe there's a lot, as is the case with co-dependency. Selfishly helping others can lead to severe psychological consequences.  There is selfishness, as reckless disregard for the people who love you or for your society in general.  There is selfishness, as in being rationally focused on your own betterment.  There are beneficent acts, that are intended to better another person or society in general.  Satanism is not about rejecting any one part of what it means to be human. Far from it, Satanism accepts man as he really is. That is one of our prime tenets. This means that being a beneficent (without self-deceit or co-dependency) is viable within Satanism.  The key is always balance. The key is finding a way to turn the essential conditions of being human into the greatest possible reward.  As Satanists it is not in our interest to split hairs and watch how many devils can dance on the tip of a knife. This sacrifices the utilitarian and pragmatic function of Satanism."

satanism,36kug3,brianwantsblood,1 point,Fri May 29 23:31:08 2015 UTC,"Ideomotor effect:       Ideomotor phenomenon is a psychological phenomenon wherein a subject makes motions unconsciously.  The ideomotor response (or ""ideomotor reflex""), often abbreviated to IMR, is a concept in hypnosis and psychological research.  It is derived from the terms ""ideo"" (idea, or mental representation) and ""motor"" (muscular action). The phrase is most commonly used in reference to the process whereby a thought or mental image brings about a seemingly ""reflexive"" or automatic muscular reaction, often of minuscule degree, and potentially outside of the awareness of the subject. As in reflexive responses to pain, the body sometimes reacts reflexively with an ideomotor effect to ideas alone without the person consciously deciding to take action. The effects of automatic writing, dowsing, facilitated communication, and Ouija boards have been attributed to the phenomenon.  Mystics have often attributed these effects to paranormal or supernatural force. Many subjects are unconvinced that their actions are originating solely from within themselves.  The associated term ""ideo-dynamic response"" (or ""reflex"") applies to a wider domain, and extends to the description of all bodily reactions (including, but not limited to ideo-motor and ideo-sensory responses) caused in a similar manner by certain ideas, e.g., the salivation often caused by imagining sucking a lemon, which is a secretory response. The notion of an ideo-dynamic response contributed to James Braid's first neuro-psychological explanation of the principle through which suggestion operated in hypnotism.

Gilmore is not LaVey, he's his own person with his own focus and approach to Satanism and how it applies to today's current affairs.     In my opinion, Magus Gilmore pays less attention to (but does not disregard) ritual Greater Magic and the supernatural elements of Satanism. That said he does dedicate a chapter to the practice in the Satanic Scriptures.     It's important to understand the context of the times as well. When LaVey started the Church of Satan he needed to be his own publicist. He needed to be a showman and shock people to let the world know that Satanists are real and have an organized religion of their own. This tapered off into the 80's, where LaVey himself said that phase was over, and the new phase was to start implementing Satanic ideals in the real world. So Magus Gilmore is a continuation of that. He's a lot less interested in attracting rock stars and celebrities who tend to burn out quickly and ditch Satanism in favor of the next trendy thing, and spends more time talking to successful entrepreneurs and established academics. Gilmore is also focusing on growing the Church of Satan as an international organization.    You can hear Reverend Campbell ask Gilmore himself what he sees as the differences between himself and Doctor LaVey in his Year 50 interview on 9sense, fast forwarded here."

Satanism says, sure, objectively there are no conscious gods (LaVey and Gilmore both put forth the idea that Satan can be seen as a force of nature, unconscious, and uninterested in human affairs), but we still have a social and psychological need for religion and deification. So we self-deify by acknowledging that man creates gods, so who better than ourselves.    I would also say that the common ground with Humanism and Satanism is small, especially when we talk about institutional Secular Humanism. Secular humanism has a strong emphasis on altruistic morality and distributive justice, which Satanism completely rejects. Humanism also holds ""human"" life above all else and sees it as objectively valuable, where Satanism sees human life as cheap and only as valuable as the individual living it sees it. In many cases human life is seen as worth less than animal life.    Yes, rituals are an important part of Satanism."

Although that is usually a Christian belief I just feel that it is true, but Lucifer/Satan is their own being and self-created (no relation to abrahamic beliefs or anything else). That is a big difference from what I would call Lucifarianism which seems them as different most of the time.

Many of our members have a fondness for Disney's work and consider Disneyland to be a special place.    But that's a stranger, and you're asking about someone familiar with you. Depends, but at that point you're probably best of at least explaining it on simple terms. It's the symbol that represents your philosophy, based on individualism, rationalism, and an appreciation for life and all its wonders.

satanism,35ctt8,LunaXV,10,Sat May 9 02:00:47 2015 UTC,"""What is it about?""   For the atheists and agnostics, most of us, it means whatever it apparently means. Satanism is materialism, rejection of traditional speculative pluralisms. Satan is one who challenges God, any form of Satanism challenges God.   How does it differ from other religions?   Satanism doesn't cling to specific dogma, doesn't control the actions of followers, and doesn't even require faith or belief.   What does it mean to you, as an individual?   I have an arbitrary name to pray to and some neat imagery and metaphors to consider part of my identity. I come from a long line of protestants, but the last two generations have been totally areligious, and my grandpa isn't one to judge, despite being a Lutheran minister. I like that our family has ""beaten"" Christianity, Satanism seems appropriate.   What do you think about Christianity, over all?   I can't stand the pervasiveness of immutable convictions regarded as truth. Gay sex makes you uncomfortable, better demonize it. Death makes you uncomfortable, better spin a tale about it to make myself feel better. A speculative worldview gives the thinker an infinite playing field, a mystical other to affirm any wild and bigoted belief they wanna hold. I really really hate that it's considered rude to challenge these ridiculous ideas. Christianity, like most viewpoints, is not critical enough to discern only truth. I don't want to convert people to Satanism, but I want to knock Christianity and all similar ideas down a peg.  Here is the scariest quote I've seen in the Christian Bible:   “For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:3-5)"
satanism,35ctt8,Ensurdagen,3,Sat May 9 19:09:50 2015 UTC,"Literally and without interpretation, the quote is indeed very scary. However, with interpretation it is easily understood. It's not scary or threatening at all after you understand what it means.  That particular piece of scripture talks about how Christians war with the flesh and with the enemy. These things are very destructive to our faith and can destroy it. However, If we stop ourselves from giving in to the flesh and destroy those ideas, it cannot destroy our faith. If we destroy those thoughts and make them thoughts that pleases Christ, then the flesh and the enemy cannot hurt us.   That particular piece of scripture is not about attacking the beliefs of other human beings and forcing them to believe in Christ, contrary to the way it may seem. The bible cannot be taken literally. You have to dig deeper and try to understand it and also form your own beliefs about what it means. It's very open to interpretation."
satanism,35ctt8,Ensurdagen,5,Sun May 10 18:30:51 2015 UTC,"It's scary, to me, that people are willing to make their thoughts  obedient. It doesn't matter to me that it isn't about proselytizing. It's about the way the faithful treat their own ideas, they will consistently claim those ideas are as real as the keyboard in front of me. This corrupts human media, increases the amount of pointless noise with no disclaimers attached. Even if you aren't aggressively telling people to be delusional, being delusional yourself pushes the metaphorical collective human consciousness towards delusion. One doesn't call the typical effect they have on people proselytizing, but beliefs aren't held in a vacuum.  Also, even if that isn't what the passage means, look at how it says it. Feel what these words, ""weapon,"" ""strongholds,"" ""obedient,"" ""every,"" evoke. Half-truths, double meanings, and the way we've translated it are part of the metaphor, too."

As long as they don't strive to physically hurt anyone, why should it matter?  Peace is what I live for. It's unlikely that the world as we know it will ever find absolute peace, but that doesn't mean that peace can't be found in some forms. By negatively assuming things about the beliefs of others, we don't spread peace. By questioning the beliefs of others in a negative fashion, we don't spread peace. We fuel anger and frustration, which leads to conflict and violence. Not good for the world.  I believe that if we stop trying to do these things, and just come to accept that people believe differently, the world can grow and become a better place. Honestly, I really don't care what people believe. I mean, I do in a sense. I like to learn about the beliefs of other people, but their beliefs don't affect how I view them, regardless of how absolutely bizarre and strange their beliefs might seem to me.  I sound like a hippie."
satanism,35ctt8,Ensurdagen,2,Tue May 12 20:14:19 2015 UTC,"Because physical violence isn't the only thing we can consider unethical, and direct physical violence isn't the only way to kill somebody. I consider a good chunk of murdered or attacked gays and transsexuals, dead and miserable orphans that could have been birth-controlled, dead faith-healed and alternative-medicined people, cult killings, even many racism and sexism victims to be at the hands of delusional thought processes. If a Satanist kills somebody or does something stupid that leads to their death, at least they aren't predisposed to think it's justified by divine judgement or that their danegrous treatment (i.e. reiki because it inspires a false sense of confidence and people stop doing chemo, coffee enemas, eating supplements with questionable content, faith-healing, prescribing homeopathic medicine in lieu of effective stuff...) should have worked, but that person just happened to die.  Bigotry and dangerous incompetence need justification. Spreading delusion can cause or prevent death, it's totally random because it isn't based on reality. Mostly, it wastes time and mental effort and makes some things illegal that could cure diseases if we studied them (especially stem cells and general human genetics). I think fixing the human consciousness can make our actions more efficient, make ethics less confusing to people. Plus, I'm really annoyed by the way people pick their friends by who coddles their delusion the most and the anti-intellectual political and social movements that seem so popular and make the world a worse place, if only by taking time away from productive things.  Different mental sources of tranquility are interchangeable. What's important is the person's mental state when they're being preached to. You don't need the specific words, ""Amen,"" or ""Christ,"" or any of the other words in the bible or a specific holy book to find peace, any other source of tranquility would do. It's silly to think religion is anything but a relic of a race that found the world they live in mysterious, with no central hubs of the whole of human knowledge to draw from. Today, insane amounts of media are created every day with so many different viewpoints, it's an entirely different playing field, but most people are trapped in archaic ways of considering the thoughts of other humans.  Of course we shouldn't challenge people incapable of changing their belief, it's a waste of time, but rational people like you are worth explaining my grievances to. Quite frankly, if I didn't have the goal to reduce delusion, I'd lie to people for money, since most people, including you in your last post, seem to find it ethical and it's very easy. Sadly, I'd hate myself if I did that.  The Red Pill is another great example of delusional belief. They don't aspire for physical violence, but they channel their rage with arbitrary and hard to challenge justification and practically advocate it."

I mean, I know some christians are open minded to lgbt stuff, but Ive never seen this before. Serious respect.    Well, depending on the satanist it could be a lot of things. Im an atheistic satanist, I simply believe in the symbolic power of a religion, and choose to align myself with the idea of Satan as an archetypical symbol of free will and individual thought. Satan as a character accepts all the people God doesnt want in his paradise, and he was the one who gave us the 'forbidden' knowledge of right and wrong. Seems like he'd be a pretty good person to base a philosophy around. Satanism is a religion largely about self determination, and unlike other religions, we are encouraged to live our lives to their fullest instead of in needless restraint.  Sort of answered in 1.

I identify as a member of the satanic temple. Temple Satanism is a non theist religion (thus we see Lucipher not as deity, nor as prophet, but as a mere symbol) based on Milton's Paradise Lost representation of Satan: romantic and humane. The teaching it offers boil down to one: question the morality of authority- legal and moral are not synonyms. What we appreciate in literary satan is his will to rebel even in the face of overwhelming power. To me as an individual is just a mean to call religion what I have been thinking by myself for a long time- Our sense of morality shouldn't be taught by religions that  spoke to people of their time hundred of years ago, they should come from our own sensibility and compassion, and experience of the world we live in today. There are some Tenets, that you can read here- http://thesatanictemple.com/?page_id=15. The whole About Us subpages are very insightful and clearer that I can ever be. My thought on Christianity is.. I don't really know. I absolutely dread how they teach the religion at such a young age when you're incapable of grasping even what they're making you say, and how the whole repent system works, as in with prayer and confession you wash away wrongdoings, I see it as a bubble to isolate from guilt, offering no way to learn from what you have done.

satanism,35ctt8,StudiodeKadent,3,Sat May 9 06:07:41 2015 UTC,"No one else is going to, so I'll inform you.  This interview will be illuminating for you. The daughter of Satanism's founder, Zeena LaVey, & her then fiance, Nikolas Shreck, discuss Satanism with televangelist Bob Larson.  Moving on to your questions:   What is it about? What is the basis of this belief or...non belief?   Satanists are atheists, viewing Satan as nothing more than a literary archetype. Theistic practitioners are Luciferians, which is basically inverted Judeo-Christianity. Christianity is a Right Hand Path religion like Judaism, Buddhism, Humanism, Taoism, Jainism, & even Islam, all of which are based/focused on helping others & the weak, indiscriminate love for all living things, sacrifice, self-sacrifice, subservience, abstaining, & being a follower in general. Any Left Hand Path ethos is about leading, serving/elevating the self, seeking unknown knowledge (esoteric studies), seeking uncommon experience (all experience is an initiation), challenging taboo, living beyond the simplistic confines of a dualistic worldview of good/evil, eye for an eye (Lex Talionis/vengeance), helping/loving only the strong & deserving (Social Darwinism), & indulgence.     How does it differ from other religions?   Satanism & other Left Hand Path philosophies do not proselytize or actively seek to convert others, as Christianity does. We don't want the masses to join us. Judaism doesn't seek converts either, but that's because Yahweh judges Gentile converts more harshly than His chosen people are judged; as such, rabbis will tell you not to convert to Judaism. Here are the 11 Satanic Rules of Earth, the 9 Satanic Statements, the 9 Satanic Sins. You will likely find that you already hold some of these beliefs, or similar ones, & there's nothing wrong with that.     What does it mean to you, as an individual?   These past posts will quickly explain a small part of my philosophic journey from being in Lutheran seminary & doing mission work abroad to serving myself & espousing Satanism. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. My experiences with 3rd World missionary work, compounded with untimely the suicide of my fiance, showed me that there can be no helping of others who won't help themselves. I experienced a brutal disillusionment which pushed me to move beyond what I see as a simple, dogmatic, & archaic Bronze-Age path bound by good/evil. I no longer believe in good or evil.     What do you think about Christianity, over all?   That being said, I hold no ill will toward Christians or the church. As for my opinion on Christianity, I wouldn't be who I am today without having been an incredibly devout Christian. More devout than I'd like to admit. As I said before, I was in the seminary & doing mission work for 15 years. The Abrahamic/Judeo-Christian ethic helped make me the Satanist that I am today. If Christianity works for you, it works for you & I'm glad that it brings you peace. I do sincerely believe that the Judeo-Christian church stifles freedom, both mental & constitutional. I believe that it's primarily used as a political tool sway & placate the masses via cultural-warfare/kulturkampf for the last several thousand years. Given that, I also recognize that there are a multitude of people in the world who would be destroying society & committing daily atrocities if it weren't for their dogma holding them back.  If Christianity works for you & makes you happy, keep at it."

I just want to say, that statement embodies the philosophy of Satanism in my opinion.    *What is it about? What is the basis of this belief or...non belief (I'm cringing. I feel like someone is going to come and slay me for sounding so dumb)?   Well, I can only speak for myself, and I'm a theistic practitioner so my view is not typically the majority opinion.   I believe that when the mythology of each culture is studied, patterns arise and each deity that was akin to ""Satan"" represents enlightenment. Through ritual and meditation, I attempt to get in touch with that essence that could just as easily be called Set, Prometheus, Apophis, Leviathan, Phosphorus, The Red King, The Horned God, etc...in order to gain enlightenment, strength, and to evolve myself as I see fit.   *How does it differ from other religions?   It does not believe in conversion, and shouldn't believe in advertisements and marketing. It does not tell people what to do, what to think, or how to feel, but rather says to pursue your own Will, and act as you see fit. It wishes to bestow wisdom, not create worshippers.   *What does it mean to you, as an individual?   It means quite a bit. It is the only system that echoes my honest beliefs. I did not form my beliefs around Satanism, but rather, began calling myself a Satanist because it agreed with my perspective.  Since I believe I'm working with deity, it plays a part in most of my moral and ethical decisions. I do not want to reflect badly on these beliefs, there has been quite enough if that already. I also don't want to fuck up any results I get by my own ignorance and/or arrogance.   *What do you think about Christianity, over all? (please, don't be too harsh. Speak your mind, but be aware that not all of us are bad apples. )    Christianity as Jesus supposedly taught is fine. It's essentially just telling people not to be a dick. I'd honestly buy the guy a beer, if he'd accept. BUT, Christianity as an organized religion is absolutely poison to humans. It does nothing but keep people down, it intentionally breeds ignorance and convinces people it's a virtue. It's the worst thing for human evolution. As a system, it is nothing but a plagiarism and perversion of the systems that came before it and has done nothing but harm humanity.

Christians consider this act to be one which corrupted our species and forced us to have to ""mend"" our relations with God (which, according to Christianity, comes through Yeshua of Nazareth).  Satanists, either literally or metaphorically, consider humanity's so-called-""fall"" to be humanity's finest moment, and indeed the essence of humanity. Humanity is MEANT to be proud, worthy, to grow great, to build towers of Babylon, to extend our grasp, to learn more, to become like gods. Our intellect and will and defiance elevate us.  This distinction is often described as ""Left Hand Path vs. Right Hand Path."" The former is about individualism, defiance, growing great, independent thought, the kind of stuff associated with the Anglo-American Enlightenment-Individualist tradition etc. The latter is about conformity, obedience, acceptance of a servile position, humility, ""knowing one's place"" etc.   How does it differ from other religions?   Well the moral distinction is important. The majority of religions are ""Right Hand Path."" All kinds of Satanism, and I think also Norse Paganism/Asatru, and Enlightenment-values philosophies (although they aren't religions) are Left Hand Path. LHP is very much a minority position.  In essence, the majority of religions and philosophies have been basically wishing (symbolically speaking) that Adam and Eve didn't eat the fruit, and that we remained part of the animal kingdom with no abstract reasoning or knowledge of morality, and thus we'd be ""free"" of the ""burden"" of thinking for ourselves. Satanists (and other LHPers) embrace this ""burden"" as liberation, and as our highest virtue.   What does it mean to you, as an individual?   I am not a Satanist. That said, I see both Atheistic and Theistic Satanism as basically camped-up and theatrical ways in which people embrace the tenets of LHP (and often, but not always, enlightenment-individualist) philosophies. Sure, there are some inconsistencies, but really, every step helps IMO. Satanism can also be a great way to reject oppression from some religionists, and thus it can be personally very empowering. It can be great therapy.    What do you think about Christianity, over all? (please, don't be too harsh. Speak your mind, but be aware that not all of us are bad apples. )    I absolutely loathe its ethics, epistemology, metaphysics and basically everything about it. That said, I do NOT think all Christians are evil nor does my hatred of Christianity (and reasons for) apply to all types of Christianity. So no, I do not hate all Christians by default (I admit I am tentative around Christians by default but I don't hate people instantly just because they're Christian). There are several kinds of Christianity I find relatively harmless (if silly). That said, the most historically popular and powerful kind/s of Christianity are, IMO, quite dangerous."
satanism,35ctt8,ImperatorTempus42,1 point,Sun May 10 18:37:47 2015 UTC,"I'm answering based entirely on LaVeyan Satanism. Other Satanists may agree or disagree, but LaVeyan is undeniably the largest and most visible branch of Satanism.  Remember, Satanism is militantly individualistic. There's really just The Satanic Bible as common ground, but almost everything else is fair game.   *What is it about? What is the basis of this belief or...non belief   Core beliefs include: * Individualism * Epicurianism * Secularism * Egoism * Self-Deification * Naturalism * Social Darwinism * Lex Talionis (eye for an eye)   *How does it differ from other religions?   In numerous ways really...for one, Satanism is the only religion out there that admits openly that it's all show business.  Two, Satanism attempts to separate worship of deities from spirituality. It is the idea that atheistic beliefs can include spirituality. e.g., I get my spirituality from the beauty of the Universe itself. You cannot possibility be unmoved by images of deep space from Hubble Space Telescope.  There are other ways. But it's best you drop $8.99 and buy The Satanic Bible. It's impossible to cover in a reddit post.   *What does it mean to you, as an individual?   Satanism to me is the driving force behind my need to be competent in all aspects of my life. I believe that the Satanist must be competent, as a reflection of the success of his Satanic philosophy.  Additionally, Satanism, I suppose, is also justification for my more manipulative and selfish side. I have no qualms about twisting people around me to suit my needs, nor do I have qualms about using the mental state of others to my advantage. It's easier to have no qualms about something when you know others don't either. As for why it's easier, there's an entire subject that explores this thoroughly called Social Psychology.   *What do you think about Christianity, over all?   I don't think very much about Christianity. At all. Except when one of its representatives or members attempt to shape the law of the land to tip the scales in their favor, and against me as an individual.   I used to think a lot about Christianity, being born-again at one point in my life. But I ended up seeing it as a massive con for money, and left the church. Lo and behold, 10 years later, the church's leadership were all charged with fraud and misappropriation of funds. Google City Harvest Church Singapore.  Hope this helps."
satanism,35ctt8,Sinel,-13,Sun May 10 19:40:43 2015 UTC,"For too long the truth of Satan has been skewed. Contrary to popular belief Satan is actually an extraterrestrial that created humanity. Him along with the 72 Goetic demons and many more are actually Gods that were known throughout various parts of the ancient world. The christian bible bastardized one god in particular  named Enki. Enki is one of the many names of a God that literally genetically engineered the first humans. He was known as Ptah in Egypt, Shiva in India, Melek Taus to the ancient Yezidi people of current day Iraq, and many others. the character ""Satan"" in the bible is the bastardized version of our true creator that wanted to help us reach spiritual ascendance (give us the fruit of knowledge) but he was thwarted by his enemies the Reptilian aliens,their henchmen the Greys, and the people behind the enforcement of today's major religions.  http://see_the_truth.webs.com/  joyofsatan.org"

It states that this life is based around pain and advocates for the avoidance and removal of want. Satanism is about indulging, proudly, but with an epicurean eye towards doing so.   LaVey talks about how some Satanists enjoy helping others, and if you enjoy it, without being the victim of a psychic vampire, to continue helping those who you deem worthy.   Reading the Satanic Bible and other works by LaVey and Gilmore to start is a good way of having these questions answered.   Visit www.churchofsatan.com for more info."

I am a secular one though, I try to meditate (without all the religious fluff involved) because many scientists actually say it does help organize thoughts, much like the REM cycle of sleep."
satanism,34wz2r,cagedboy,1 point,Mon May 11 03:03:53 2015 UTC,"Bit late to this thread but I think my comment has merit.   I'm and Atheistic Satanist who was profoundly influenced by Ayn Rand. I would say that Satanism and even Objectivism care more about the TRUTH as can be verified and observed. Satanism lays that burden on the individual whereas Objectivism tries to demonstrate their truth to the collective. Many of Rand's ideas have proven incorrect over time and a true Objectivist will modify his/her views based on that evidence. But as a Satanist, if you find Socialist/Communist views to be valid then it's your responsibility to adhere to them. It's all about you.  As to Altruism. I'm extremely altruistic and have no problem resolving it with Satanism. Altruism is inherently selfish and self serving no matter how you slice it. It makes people feel better about themselves or allows them to place themselves above others and some people even use it to justify committing atrocities. Any which way it's self serving. I personally use it to feel good but I try to help people who genuinely deserve it. Sometimes I even help people who don't deserve it and are just going to buy drugs or booze but that's ok too because it gives me that selfish rush all the same.   So by all means, I say try to impose your socialist views through politics and give your last penny to whomever you wish if it's what makes you feel good."

I'm not sure those boots are licked entirely clean.   Anywho, you're pretty spot on with what you said. The Satanic Bible has a Compassion Ritual in it for a reason, even if you don't dig on the ritual itself, that should be a pretty big indicator that there's a right way to be compassionate. Compassion is part of our genetics, we're big ol' social monkeys and no amount of elitism will change that, save the odd sociopath or two."

Satanism is about individuality and if there are specific ideals you already live by or things within satanism that you think will make your life better then embrace them.  Pick and choose what you like and call yourself whatever you want.  Use it to improve yourself or to give you a different view on life, but don't change your life just to fit some type of mold.

What I was trying to say is research the different ideals and see what interests you and build off those and be what you are and better yourself; don't change yourself just to fit in.  To use my own personal experience I've been a satanist for around 25 years now.  I live with two out of three people I have known for about 18 years and just the other day one of them noticed the pentagram tattoo's I've had for over 20 years on my legs and had no idea I am a satanist.  it's who I am but my beliefs don't define me."

As for your question I'd say Buddhism and LeVay Satanism is incompatible because Buddhism is about letting go to things while LeVay Satanism says to indulge.

Also remember that although Satanism is considered a religion, it's really more of a moral stamp or code. LaVey wrote that people are either born one or not, one cannot one day just choose to be so. You can take that with however many grains of salt you want, but If you're truly not anything like what he writes and you try to emulate it, you're only cheating yourself and are at that point posing. Go ahead and look at the side bar of the reddit and you can find the Satanic bible which was written by LaVey, the creator of LaVeyen satanism. If you're looking for theistic Satanism I'm afraid I can't help you since their beliefs are certainly not easy to find or organized. LaVeys written many works and you should read all of them. Should you be scared of what exactly? Being judged? Sure that can be scary but a main tenant of satanism is that you shouldn't tell someone unless they directly question or ask you first, so that will go a long way in keeping you unjudged. Should you be scared you're adjoining yourself with something involving satan? Hell no, you're 15 and still maturing, learning and exploring is an important thing especially when you're younger. Show respect to those on the subreddit and I'm entirely sure they will be more than happy to assist you with any questions, you can also sift through the subreddit and look at old threads which can bring some much needed light on subjects you might not find in a book. What's the best thing about Satanism? You can make it what you want, and it can actually lead to real balance in your life, unlike what people think the bible tried to provide as ""balance"". Satanists for the most part are non violent, appreciative of nature, carnal and are always in search of improving themselves, their habitat and their lives. 15 is an interesting age, and life gets a little wonky around there so Satanism can either help or really hinder you. If it seems like something you really lack the understanding or maturity to fully embrace wait until you're older, it isn't going anywhere."

Control is an important thing to have over oneself at your age, I'm only 17 years old and I regret situations I mucked up because of my lack of control. Satanism may help you with that. Because of the lack of education most people have on satanism, the second the word I'm a ""satanist"" comes out of your mouth, most of the time shit hits the fan. Most people when they hear that think you're some goth school shooter who in his free time cuts goats heads off and goes to massive orgies.

Sometime it doesn't matter how much You explain people will always think a certain thing about you if you give them something to hook onto.

satanism,34nfwf,Invisible-War,7,Sat May 2 20:32:24 2015 UTC,"Satanists don't evangelize like Christians. No one is going to tell you, yes Satanism is the way to go because of x, y and z. It's a very take it or leave it sort of situation. No one will try to pull you in and retain you but there's no institution for excommunicating you either. A private Satanic church could kick you out if you're being a disorderly or malicious asshole but that holds true for any other private organization or club and wouldn't remove you from the entire religion.   I am my own god, I alone control my level of happiness and I believe in myself and that self education is the path to power."

So if you hurt someone or some animal that life form will reasonably seek to avoid you, not like you or become enemies with you. If you want continued happy access to future experiences with life forms you've wronged, then you alone are responsible for doing whatever it takes to not hurt them or accept that in order to respect them, they need to be free of you.   Instead of forgiveness there's admitting one's own mistakes and figuring out how to make it right or mitigate the harm or cease engaging in the harmful behavior."

satanism,34nfwf,psiodrake,1 point,Sun May 3 00:18:50 2015 UTC,"Satanism is not for everyone. It is for the few. Outsiders. Leaders & rebels. It largely requires you to decide your own path & cast yourself upon a journey of self-discovery through breaking of personal/cultural taboo, viewing each worldly experience as an initiation.  Keep in mind the 11 Rules of Earth as well as the 9 Satanic Sins. To make this choice you must properly educate yourself. In regard to the decision ahead of you, the most pertinent to keep in mind would be the 1st & 6th Satanic sins:   1. Stupidity: The top of the list for Satanic Sins. The Cardinal Sin of Satanism. It’s too bad that stupidity isn’t painful. Ignorance is one thing, but our society thrives increasingly on stupidity. It depends on people going along with whatever they are told. The media promotes a cultivated stupidity as a posture that is not only acceptable but laudable. Satanists must learn to see through the tricks and cannot afford to be stupid.  6. Lack of Perspective: Again, this one can lead to a lot of pain for a Satanist. You must never lose sight of who and what you are, and what a threat you can be, by your very existence. We are making history right now, every day. Always keep the wider historical and social picture in mind. That is an important key to both Lesser and Greater Magic. See the patterns and fit things together as you want the pieces to fall into place. Do not be swayed by herd constraints—know that you are working on another level entirely from the rest of the world.   With this in mind, educating yourself must remain your 1st & foremost concern. We, nor anyone else, can tell you what to believe or if this is the life for you. We do not proselytize & convert others as Christians & other members of Right Hand Path religions do, as that would be a form of the 5th Satanic Sin, Herd Conformity.  Additionally, the 5 points of Pentagonal Revisionism are integral to your understanding of this philosophy.  Educate yourself. I hope the best for you, regardless of which path suits your lifestyle."

satanism,34gm5f,Invisible-War,2,Fri May 1 09:45:31 2015 UTC,"In my experience I've observed the very real effects of aesthetics, architecture, and audio stimuli as they are applied in a ritual setting. At a basic level participants are affected and can change the world according to the goals of the working. That's why the most effective rituals are those with large audiences (performances, etc)  But that's not the end of it. I understand that OP and you are asking about influence at a distance. I believe there to be so many variables at play that it will be a very long time before there can be any substantial scientific claims on this phenomenon. I believe most projected influence to be minimal, limited by what LaVey termed the Balance Factor (realistic expectations).     LaVey addressed the skepticism of magic by noting that nothing but extreme, highly repeatable physical manipulation will only begin to convince the hardcore skeptic. He proposed that the amount of psychic energy to accomplish this could be used to gather an army across the world (proposed, not saying this can be done), so why would this person bother with that exercise if he wouldn't be believed anyway?     Personally I see magic as a subtle art that can tip things in your favor. Workings are like a combination lock, requiring various pieces to fall into place, some in your control, some not. I've had more than a few lucky coincidences in my life not to dismiss the Seventh Rule."

I keep an open mind, but I don't let my brain fall out.    No, not a ""theist"" at all. I don't believe any of this requires any belief in external intervening gods, spirits, or demons.

I do not know which flavor of satanism you follow. Regardless of how busy your respective lives are y'all need to set time aside to have a conversation on satanism. Fights over this and passive aggression will damage your relationship, but a real discussion will clear everything up.        Had ever this discussion occurs I recommend that you open by admitting that you want to continue your relationship. Next you should explain the role satanism has in your past and current life. Perhaps it influenced your beliefs, perhaps you perform rituals as a way to blow off steam, or whatever you feel he deserves to understand ""what he is getting himself into"" if satanism continues to be a part of your life.        Point out that whatever preconceptions he may have about satanists, Christians do not get to decide what and how Muslims believe/worship. No outsiders deserve any validity when saying ""real satanists kill so-and-so or have no morals or..."" Satanists decide what and how Satanists allow their religion/philosophy to influence their lives.

I have liberal Christian friends who are in interfaith relationships with Jewish, Muslim, and neopagan partners.  But our religion and theirs.... it should be a given that we're incompatible to go that deeply intimate with them. I'm friends with many Christians, but having a few pints with your Jesus-loving mates once a week or having a Christian roommate is a world of difference than spending the rest of your life and having children with a Christian. Recently I had to call off a developing relationship with a Christian woman friend of mine who I must admit I really like, and she reciprocates those feelings. We have so much in common and our personalities have a good chemistry.... Sadly, we both realize that in the end we would end up hurting each other: she'd be hurt by me listening to black metal songs about burning churches and impaling priests, and I'd become aggravated by her Christian rock and her friends' Bible studies in our (hypothetical future) home. She doesn't deserve that and neither do I, so I accept that it was simply not meant to be.

That said, I sincerely recommend reading Magister Gilmore's book. Peter H. Gilmore has a much more... refined take on Satanism, and his book is frankly a masterpiece.

It served its purpose, briefly, as a statement against the Judao Christian moral dogma of the time. Today, LaVeyan Satanism has no meaning or relevance.  Look at the list you have just posted. From 1 to 10, your list describes a worldview that is indistinguishable from mainstream liberal beliefs. Judging by your 10 points, the average Democrat voter is a LaVeyan Satanist.  LaVeyans concede that they don't believe in supernatural beings, nor do they believe in magic. They worship ""Satan"" only as a symbol and perform rituals only as form of psychotherapy. If you identify as a LaVeyan Satanist, you should be honest with yourself and accept that your ""Satanism"" is just a shallow attempt to distinguish yourself as more ""edgy"" than the average left wing atheist.  A ""Church of Satan"" whose high priest posts Facebook updates. Is there anything sadder?"
satanism,3471na,cc1945,4,Wed Apr 29 14:14:52 2015 UTC,"LaVey's philosophy is needed now more than ever. If you think his message is strictly anti-Judeo-Christian (learn to spell it if you're going to address it), then you need to work on your reading comprehension (if you read any of his material at all).    OP's list is his own subjective application of Satanism. I don't agree with it, and I think many other Satanists won't either. I could easily come up with a list that's directly the opposite of these points that are more closely aligned with LaVey's philosophy. But that shouldn't matter, it's up to each person to decide how they want to integrate Satanism in their lives.     We believe in some things that could be considered ""supernatural"", though we don't think them to be spiritual in nature. We also do accept magic beyond psychodrama, though we do not require blind-belief in this. Don't be a dummy, what in the world makes you think High Priest Gilmore posts on Facebook? Because we have an official page? You do realize that other people can maintain and post to a Facebook page, and many large organizations have a staff that handles things things, right? I would know because I'm part of that staff that posts and moderates it. Sorry to burst your bubble but Peter Gilmore is not on social media.

LaVey was a liar who fabricated the large majority of his life story. He claimed to work as a forensic photographer for the SFPD, for example, though there is no record of this.  He was a Hollywood Jew who liked to perform music at burlesque shows and drink and party with celebrities. The Church of Satan was no different to a toga party.  LaVeyan Satanism is borderline embarrassing. It's a party game for grown ups. It's something safe and mainstream pretending to be something dangerous and rebellious.

I've never personally met a LaVeyan that is all about the image of satanism, but then again I don't associate with the kind of people that would. You seem way too focused on the theatrics.

So even if you can't get rid of or change those programs it's better to focus on yourself because you aren't doing anyone any favors by trying to drag other people along with you when they want nothing but to sit on their asses.

An end to discrimination on the basis of sex, race, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other immutable characteristic.

It is the recognition that every act it ultimately already selfishly-driven, but it is not the reckless narcissism that you might be thinking.  Humans are accountable, not to some intangible other being, but to the other flesh-and-bone life forms that they must co-habitate with.  The idea is equal opportunity, but does not promise equal outcome (most people's idea of ""equality"" these days is based heavily on the outcome rather than the actual opportunity).  It is the responsibility of the individual to use their wits/talents/skills/etc to use the opportunity to their best advantage."

A lot of people (even the ones who actually know what the fuck Satanism really is) still think it's this douchey ""belief"" where you just act like an asshole and do whatever the fuck you want.  And now that I think about it. There's nothing wrong with being selfishly-driven at all. We all should know what's best for us. We shouldn't have to consult our parents, authority figures, or magical beings in the sky to tell us how we should think or feel. Obviously we shouldn't actively harm ourselves or other people, and there's nothing wrong with asking for advice from trusted sources but yeah do what the fuck YOU want.  If you're not happy do something about it. If you're job or relationship or whatever isn't going right, gather up the strength and courage and make the change. Don't pray it away or go along with something because of ""tradition"" or whatever. In fact I'd go as far as saying NOT acting in selfishly driven interest is worse and it's even more disingenuous. At that point you're compromising your own values, your basically mindfucking yourself as well because you know it's not lining up with your beliefs,  and in turn making things worse for everyone else including yourself once you eventually come back around to fix the mess you made."

Satanism, to me, is in a sense a vow to consciously and deliberately be self-serving, and to do so in a way that doesn't make me an almighty prick.  If you want to look at it purely egocentrically, not being too much of a cunt benefits you directly; taking anything you want with reckless abandon will hurt you in the long run as people get tired of your shit. So I suppose it's utilitarian too - do what you need to make life as easy and enjoyable as possible.  Wicca has a belief that improving the self is vital to benefiting others, more specifically you should raise yourself instead of cast others down.

Negative eugenics is the restriction of genes through sterilization and birth control. Positive eugenics increases fit genes through the promotion of procreation (financial incentives, etc.). Peter H. Gilmore advocated a Satanic Third Side (which genetic scientists have called ""New Eugenics""), which is the advancement of genetic engineering and embryo profiling.

satanism,332v52,ImpiousXIII,6,Sun Apr 19 00:14:05 2015 UTC,I suggest some further reading. The Church of Satan website has a lot to offer including an updated version of the Five Point Plan  http://churchofsatan.com/five-point-plan-revisited.php
satanism,332v52,bunbunofdoom,4,Sun Apr 19 05:16:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link, though I personally have read this article already. It makes a similar point and suggests that much remains to be done. Where is the updated version of the five point plan?"
satanism,332v52,Invisible-War,3,Sun Apr 19 05:53:05 2015 UTC,"I spoke to Magistra Barton about this article and the work that needs to be done refers to the advances by those individuals who wish to achieves these goals, not the goals themselves. We feel no need to update or adjust our program, only to switch focus from time to time."
satanism,332v52,Invisible-War,2,Sun Apr 19 06:36:55 2015 UTC,"Interesting. If, for hypothetical example, strict taxes were enforced on all churches, would the plan be updated that point? New goals set?"
satanism,332v52,Invisible-War,2,Sun Apr 19 06:54:37 2015 UTC,"That would make sense, yes."
satanism,332v52,Invisible-War,3,Sun Apr 19 07:37:01 2015 UTC,"First of all, the Church of Satan never had a public political agenda, so to say it moved away from that is inaccurate. The Five Point Program has always been a general guideline for individuals to pursue and use as a barometer to determine if they wish align themselves with the organization. We do not want to make headlines as the Church of Satan. We have many members who are out there pushing those Five Points in their lives but we do not require, or even desire, them to attach our name to their projects. We believe a Satanic revolution will happen and is happening without people realizing it. I can expand on some ways out members are active in each area.   Blanche Barton gave a few examples of how this can be achieved in her revisited article. There are Satanists working closely with political organizations whose purpose is to cut government spending, cut social welfare programs, and  restriction government intervention. This includes about both local and national politics and a number of well funded think tanks. Very rarely do these individuals mention their Satanism by name, but their actions speak volumes. Focus has increased, and will be a talking point in the upcoming elections.  Not a focal point at the moment. Social norms have yet to accept the taxation of religious institutions. But HBO's recent Going Clear documentary on Scientology planted a seed on the absurdity of religious tax laws, so we hope that will bear fruit in the future.   The current Church-State debate is an obvious focal point. We have many members directly supporting and functioning in organizations like the Center of Inquiry, American Atheists, JREF, and others. We've had guests on skeptical and atheist podcast, radio shows (I just did one for a Miami based group), conferences, and more, nearly all on the common ground in the fight to keep our secular government. But some other points of interest would be the legalization of marijuana and right to die with dignity (both often fought by religious right).    We have some very public members working on such things as Real Dolls, demonic baby dolls, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. Much of this ties with the last point.    This one is fought both in the virtual and carnal worlds. On the former we have members pursuing virtual environments and AI. As for the latter, we have several public Satanists showing off their beautiful (or terrifying) homes and others manufacturing the products and materials necessary to give it that Satanic touch. But with that comes the need for privacy. With increased government surveillance and data collection comes the real threat of Thought Crime and a crackdown on outsider interests. Part of the goal of Total Environments and Artificial Human Companions is to have safe place to exorcize taboo interests without fear of hurting others or bringing unwanted attention.  This has been a hard fought issue for some very well known Satanists, including one Reverend who was featured in an Academy Award winning documentary on the issue.     So my point is, we are out there, making our moves as best we see fit. The Church of Satan exists to reach out to others who may share our goals and applications, not as a political party. We're interested in people who are out there right now applying these points in the real world, not those who are waiting on us to give them meaning. More often than not, realistically, flying a Sigil of Baphomet does your movement more harm than good. So don't do it, and don't come crying to us if you do and it backfires. Ideally this wouldn't be an issue, but we're not there yet. But we're not far off either."
satanism,332v52,439052-3,4,Sun Apr 19 07:35:48 2015 UTC,"Top quality comment, thank you. Reading it, I can see that there are a couple things that are possibly unclear from my original post:   Politics- I understand (and fully agree) that Satanism should not align itself with any political ideology. However, there are specific issues, church taxation for example, that are worth taking a stance on and can also be considered ""political"". It would be worthwhile to make a more clear distinction here. Progress- My less-than-rosey opinion of the progress that has been made on the five points is not meant to insult Satanists and similar minded folk who have been working hard on these issues.  Obviously though, much remains to be done. Publicity- By public oriented agenda, I did not mean that the Church of Satan should be directly working to achieve these goals. And of course, ""flying a Sigil"" isn't going to help advances in AI or influence a politician. Rather, it is my opinion is that the goals themselves should be more publicly promoted. But first... Polish- Before increased promotion of Pentagonal Revisionism, the 5 points should be rewritten, updated, expanded.. something. Honestly they're embarrassing- I wouldn't even show my like-minded friends at this point. I doubt LaVey meant for this particular piece to be eternal enshrined in marble for all time. If anything should be updated to change with the times, this is it."
satanism,332v52,Invisible-War,2,Sun Apr 19 17:52:19 2015 UTC,"The thing is that the Five Point Plan is general and broad by design. It's part of that balance of the Church of Satan being a loose individualist organization. We provide some guidelines but we ultimately do not take official positions as that would misrepresent many of our members who wish to apply our philosophy in different ways, or who may not be interested in those topics at all.     Our public representatives mention the Five Point Plan frequently, I know I have and I hear it mentioned on 9sense regularly. I believe Rev Campbell even dedicates segments of his show to the points. The balance here to is not proselytize but to give material to those who are interested. That said, I do not see another revision any time soon. Blanche Barton wrote her revisited article in 2013 in the Cloven Hoof, in which she covered each point with current perspective. Members are free to address other issues not in the plan at their will, or ignore the plan altogether. Maybe in the future we may look into expanding. I could see the environmentalism being a possible addition."
satanism,332v52,purple_urkle,3,Mon Apr 20 00:08:16 2015 UTC,"On the first point, is the goal to cut welfare entirely? What is the point of that? All it's going to do is cause needless suffering, isn't it?  I'm asking these questions honestly, not trying to start a fight. Somehow the cutting of welfare doesn't sit right with me. On one hand, I kind of get it. Satanists, among others, don't want to pay so that other people can be lazy and live off of the government. Satanists want natural stratification. But why cause suffering? If food stamps are taken away, what will happen to people who are using them? Will they just die?  I'm aware that this is an emotional reaction, and that also leads me to evaluate why I'm having that reaction. That's why I'm asking these questions. I'm also aware that I might be putting words in your mouth; I'm not trying to do that, but I don't know of any better way to ask about this right now."

satanism,32yu5k,Invisible-War,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:46:24 2015 UTC,"There are very few sources that can be attributed to them. It's speculated that this is because, as small cult during a time in America where being a Devil worshiper could easily get you killed, they were not public, practiced in secret, committed very little to writing and formally published nothing at all. It wasn't until decades after it's formation that Sloane even mentioned the secret cult to anyone. Of course this makes the whole story very fuzzy as far as truth is concerned.   Regardless of what side of the fence you fall on concerning Sloane's claims as to the formation date of the cult it has had a huge influence on current Theistic Satanic philosophy."
satanism,32yu5k,Invisible-War,2,Sat Apr 18 02:43:26 2015 UTC,"Yea, that's what I've always found too.  I remember reading about them years ago, but I've never found more than that. The info just stops. I think you're right about the reasoning. I've been bumping into this same wall with every pre Gardner era group except for the Hermetic/Thelemic stuff. Even resources for Heathenism and Dark Paganism are hard to come by, except for new stuff. Everything that could be tied to ""the devil"" or even referenced a horned deity had to be kept under lock and key, with like old school secrecy pacts.   But, yes, as you say, there's no deying it's influence with current practitioners. It's just part of the fabric now, despite what may or may not be true about it. I understand the necessity of their secrecy, and respect the Hell out of them for being willing to take the risk at all."
satanism,32yu5k,Invisible-War,0,Sat Apr 18 03:52:20 2015 UTC,"The only record of the Ophite Cultus Sathanas (the last word having no theological or metaphysical meaning, it was borrowed from an Amazing Stories novella) being founded in 1948 was a 1973 interview, and vaguely in some letters in 1968 in which he praises LaVey. There's no record of Sloane being anything other than a Mystic or Spiritualist (popular at the time) until 1968. At this time he is confirmed to have been affiliated with LaVey and the Church of Satan via the Grotto system. Official records are mixed, Aquino claims to not have heard of him as an important member during his time in the CoS, and also verifies he was not relevant to Satanism or considered himself a Satanist until after LaVey gained publicity in the late Sixties. The little media attention Sloane did get in the 70's compared him as a dumbed down awkward version of LaVey."
satanism,32yu5k,Invisible-War,2,Sat Apr 18 06:22:13 2015 UTC,"Also   The only record of the Ophite Cultus Sathanas (the last word having no theological or metaphysical meaning   Uh...no.  Sloane equated Sathanas - the original spelling used for his Coven, with The Horned God, he didn't have a name for it until he read Margaret Murphy's ""The God of the Witches"", at which point he saw it as equivalent with Satan.  I have no clue what you're going on about saying it had no theological significance. That's blatantly false."
satanism,32yu5k,bunbunofdoom,0,Sat Apr 18 06:39:14 2015 UTC,"The whole ""Horned God"" story came out in an 1972 interview. At a glance through my notes and copy of ""The God of Witches"" it seems that at no point is the term ""Sathanas"" ever used. There is a recollected story of a witch who referred to a familiar as ""Sathan"". And that's it. Funny enough, ""The God of Witches"" was reprinted in 1970. Convenient timing.    So yes, no theological significance. There is no historical anthropological or theological connection to the term ""Sathanas"". The only printed material that the term appears in is a story in a 1946 issue of Amazing Stories (Shaver made up the word, his character was based on Ming the Merciless, ruler of the planet Satana. Odin is also in there, looking like Santa) and a whole bunch of illiterate black metal albums."
satanism,32yu5k,bunbunofdoom,0,Sat Apr 18 07:10:19 2015 UTC,"Interesting, but seeing as Sloane's organization and mythology clearly predates LaVey, Aquino, and all their atheistic nonsense, I don't take their opinions to mean much. Especially since they so clearly want a monopoly on the terms and belief system."

satanism,32w9s4,Abandoninghope,6,Sun Apr 19 08:28:08 2015 UTC,"From personal experiences, Satanists generally don't believe in Heaven or Hell. I mean, sure, there are some ""reverse Christians"" who believe in the Christian theology but decide it's better to reign in Hell than rule in Heaven, but otherwise you won't find many who do, at least from what I've seen.  LaVeyan Satanists (the majority of Satanists) are atheists, so you can scratch off any sort of afterlife belief there. Theistic Satanists are a mixed bag, won't find any unity on afterlife beliefs.  Personally I believe in a mix of an afterlife and reincarnation similar to Old Norse beliefs. Doesn't have much to do with my practices though, I believe in living in the here and now and worrying about the afterlife once I get there."
satanism,32w9s4,ryallen94,5,Fri Apr 17 06:48:17 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to believe that as you die consciousness fades, and then I cease to exist. No heaven, no hell, and no awareness that I'm dead. I've been knocked unconscious multiple times, both medically and not, and in every single case I wasn't aware that I'd been unconscious until I'd come back around. I imagine death is simply a permanent form of this state."

satanism,32w9s4,Sleazyridr,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:36:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've encountered that retort and it might not be the best, but lack of blood going to the brain (in some of those instances) lead to lack of consciousness and inability to recognise that I'm out. Hardly a leap to infer that no blood pumping to the brain following cardiac arrest wouldn't produce the same result. If you can find it, Sam Harris makes a good point on the unlikelihood of an afterlife / soul based on what we know about the brain, the effect injuries it can receive have, and that everything that makes me ""me"" would appear to be an emergent property of the brain. Regardless, it's what I believe."
satanism,32w9s4,Boomkin1337,7,Fri Apr 17 19:02:31 2015 UTC,"I'm 99.99999999999% sure that my conciousness is a product of my brain.  So when my physical body stops functioning due to my death, my brain will also stop functioning and my conciousness will be terminated-probably forever.  My physical body will be recycled through nature and all of the matter and energy that was once ""me"" will eventually become something else.  Furthermore, I really hope there's no afterlife or reincarnation or anything because if there is, it really devalues this life IMO.  If I somehow die and reach an afterlife, I will be majorly disappointed."

One is 'academic' and focused on occult rhetoric. One is a collection of academic essays that covers what Satanism looks like in modernity. The other is focused on the overall idea of the left hand path. It's from an academic but is not on an academic imprint. Still, it's legit and thorough. There's room for disagreement with each of them which could prove to be spaces you might want to try and fill. I guess the thing I would suggest is to read as much as you can find, think about things that haven't been addressed yet, and try to enter into the overall conversation. There is a lot of stuff out there but, in my opinion, a lot of it isn't very good. I think these three are all very good in their own ways.

They can then see both sides. See, telling people half the truth, is a lie in my opinion.  Edit: why lie about it, if it matters not to you? Perhaps you wish to convert people to atheism?"

There are a couple of different pages I would suggest looking at:  Church of Satan  Satanic Temple  Diane Vera's theistic Satanism pages  Venus Satanas  Obligatory Wiki Page  I also recommend reading the Satanic Bible. Also keep in mind that the majority of theistic Satanists are not necessarily ""reverse Christians"" (in other words, they don't believe in Christian doctrine except rooting for the other side). Most of them probably subscribe to some form of Dark Paganism. Diane Vera explains this in more detail as does the Wikipedia page."

satanism,32n2vn,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:48:25 2015 UTC,"Satanism:       Satanism is a broad term referring to a group of social movements with diverse ideological and philosophical beliefs. Satanism includes symbolic association with, or admiration for, Satan, whom Satanists see as an inspiring and liberating figure. It was estimated that there were 50,000 Satanists in 1990. There may now be as many as one hundred thousand Satanists in the world.   Although the public practice of Satanism began with the founding of The Church of Satan in 1966, historical precedents exist: a group called the Ophite Cultus Satanas was founded in Ohio by Herbert Arthur Sloane in 1948.   Satanist groups that appeared after the 1960s are widely diverse, but two major trends are theistic Satanism and atheistic Satanism. Theistic Satanists venerate Satan as a supernatural deity, viewing him not as omnipotent but rather as a patriarch. In contrast, atheistic Satanists regard Satan as merely a symbol of certain human traits.     Image i - The downward-pointing pentacle is often used to represent Satanism.

satanism,32m05c,wisebrody34,14,Tue Apr 14 21:28:32 2015 UTC,"I had an old business partner about 13 years ago.  I wont go into the details of the business but it was tech related.  He wasn't a tech though and we meet randomly one day and he hired me on and after a few months he made me a partner.  Things were great for about 9 months and I moved into his nice house for cheap rent and to just make the business better.  I also took over the car payments for a car he bought for his previous boyfriend so I then had a car.  He was a gay man which I was fine with and in AA / substance abuse groups which again I was fine with but he was really into young men (he was 39, dating 17 year olds).  I didn't have a problem with this either as people can make their own choices.  The business was doing good and I had about 20K invested into it but was offered a job I couldn't turn down across the country.  I told him I would be gone for a year making money/equity in a company and he seemed fine with it.  A year goes by and he gave up AA / substance abuse.  I had seen some hard drinkers before but not like him.  He would slap beers in sseconds, and would drink 6+ beers in the time I could drink 1.  He also decided to start smoking crack/crank and was stealing from a different business partner he had with a new project.  He had sold off our entire business but was paying me monthly ""payouts"" of profits (think ponzi scheme) while I was helping him and his new partner start their new business (resturant).  I spent 3 months working form him and his silent partner dealing with him being an insane drug addict while trying to get the title to my car (which I paid off) and at the same time his ""partners"" were getting younger and younger and younger.  Towards the end he was ""dating"" a 12 year old.  Then one day I pieced everything together.  He sold off our company (lost 20K) had put a lean against my car to get this new truck (10K) and owed me 3 months back pay.  I went back to the city to continue to work waiting for him to pay me.  Then I didn't hear from him for a month.  Then one night driving back from the grocery store I got pulled over by a dozen cop cars, pulled out of my car and get guns pulled on me.  It turned out about 2 weeks prior the child's mother found out about him and filed charges.  He went into hiding and the cops couldn't find him.  And because the car was in his name they thought I was him.  This happened 3 times.  On the third time I knew I wasn't going to get my money and that I had been fucked by a 12 year old fucking petaphile who was screwing everyone over that he knew, and that his shit was rolling into my life.  Too bad for him I knew all his hiding spaces, his apartments, new new trucks plates (in his parents name)  his business (partners name) and so on.  I gave the police ever detail they needed to catch the son of a bitch and the next day they had arrested him.  The piece of shit is still in jail.  I'm still out of the tens of thousands of dollars but I can hope that for every 1K he owes me will be 1 year in jail."

He seemed to take it alright but a couple of weeks later I had been home for the weekend and my parents were dropping me back at my dorm room, turned out he has decided to vandalise my door, put a load of gay slurs on it etc. and basically outed me to my parents. (In their defence they didn't make a fuss about it until I actually came out a while later)  Anyway it got me mad and betrayed so I was clever, since by this point 1/2 the campus knew I was gay I used it to my advantage and told them that he acted this way because me tried to have sex with me but I turned him down and basically dumped his ass....   People believed it, and he ended up disappearing to another dorm when he got sick of being seen as being turned down by the only actually gay guy around the place."

satanism,32m05c,warlord666,3,Wed Apr 15 00:20:07 2015 UTC,"This is one aspect of Satanism I tend to disagree with. Granted some people need to be cut out of your life but I'd rather create more friends than enemies. So in a lot of instances when people have burned me or fucked me over I will put the fear of fucking God in them and make them understand that I am not to played with. After that, I'm willing to extend a hand. I'm willing to keep some semblance of a friendship or a line of communication open.  Most people, it seems to me, either just unintentionally fuck up and really have no ill will towards you and just need a sort of a verbal bitch slap. A reality check basically. Even if they're specifically targeting you, chances are they aren't completely in control of their emotions or always thinking rationally (none of us are all the time). Give them a scare, and if they back down, take the higher road.  The few that are though will try to fuck with you and as long as you stand your ground but do so in a firm, but friendly manner you'll tend to earn their respect as well as they're also coming from a place of insecurity or preconceived notions about you/themselves/etc. It's as easy as ""Hey chill bro! It's all good. Let me buy you a beer and tell me what's going on!"" Sometimes it's enough to snap someone out of it, and you keep the perks of having another person on your side. Another friend, lover, job prospect, etc. It makes your life so much easier then creating enemies over what usually amounts to petty bullshit.  It's very rare I'd ever have to ""destroy"" anyone and if I did I'd just do it with apathy. I'd just ignore them. Like a disappointed father who's done everything to try and help them and isn't hasn't worked. But usually at the point the feeling is mutual, or they're so far gone they're not even aware you've stopped trying."
satanism,32m5iu,Dariangump,8,Tue Apr 14 22:09:14 2015 UTC,"How long have you been a practicing Satanist?   About a year or so.   If you had a previous religious affiliation, what was it, and what made you decide to leave said religion?   I had dabbled with Taoism but it never really sat well with me.   Do those who associate with you know about your religious identity, or do you keep it more private?   I keep it mainly private, and when asked about it I usually say I'm a pagan.   Do you associate with others within the religion?   There are some LaVeyans in my friend group but I haven't met any Theists like me in real life.   Are there any holidays/celebrations related to your religion that you participate in?   Not really. If anything, I suppose I celebrate Yule instead of Christmas, but everything else remains about the same as normal. Most holidays today are just materialistic anyway.   Do you participate in holidays outside of your religion, such as Christmas or Easter?   See the previous answer.   Are there any specific restrictions your religion enforces, such as dietary?   Nope, that'd kinda ruin the point of how free Satanism is supposed to be.   Would you introduce the religion to your children, if you don't already, and why?   I'll let my children find what religion speaks to them on their own. I'll probably introduce them to a whole bunch of religions with no specific bias one way or another.   What are some major themes associated with Satanism?   Freedom, individuality, intelligence, carnality, love to those who deserve love and hatred to those who deserve hatred, and enhancing your own life.   Have you ever experienced discrimination due to your religious identity?   Nope. Mainly because most people don't know I'm a Satanist.   Do you believe there is a God?   I believe there is some godlike force that I call Satan, and I believe in the Norse pantheon as an extension of Satan.   What do you believe happens after you die?   I wish I could say I know, but I have no clue. My best guess would be a mix of an afterlife and reincarnation, with parts of you moving on to a new life and other parts moving on to a new world.  Side note: You'll probably see a variety of different responses here, as our community is split between atheists and theists. Keep that in mind."

If you had a previous religious affiliation, what was it, and what made you decide to leave said religion?    I did not, but my mother did. I was raised in a Pentecostal home. I attended because it was mandatory in order to not be kicked out and left when I turned 18.   Christianity is a perversion and corruption of the Pagan beliefs that came before it, this is historical fact, so I never saw the point in taking that plagiarism seriously.    3.) Do those who associate with you know about your religious identity, or do you keep it more private?    Some do. I've been lucky enough to find a handful of very laid back, like minded people who I can be open with. In my day to day life most don't know, I just play atheist/agnostic and fly under the radar.   4.) Do you associate with others within the religion?    Yep. My bf identifies as Pagan, but states it's all the same in his view. For the last year, I've been talking more with people  online who are part of various Satanic/Occult/Luciferian organizations. I have never joined an organization myself though.   5.) Are there any holidays/celebrations related to your religion that you participate in?    Last year I celebrated Samhain for the first time, but other than that, no. I pay attention to the moon cycles when scheduling ritual workings, not much else.   6.) Do you participate in holidays outside of your religion, such as Christmas or Easter?    Yea, none are very religiously connected anymore anyway. I see holidays as time with friends, loved ones and good food lol so I can certainly find a way to enjoy that in a secular way.   7.) Are there any specific restrictions your religion enforces, such as dietary?    Nope, those would not make any sense in this belief system.   8.) Would you introduce the religion to your children, if you don't already, and why?    Introduce? No. I'd tell them about it once they're old enough to ask about it on their own. Religion is personal, I would want them to learn about all systems and they can decide for themselves. Satanism does not believe in converting or indoctrinating people, that's christian nonsense.   9.) What are some major themes associated with Satanism?    Freedom, individuality, self reliance, the Will to Power, primal energies and emotions, darkness, strength, enlightenment, honor, and integrity.   10.) Have you ever experienced discrimination due to your religious identity?    Only at home, while growing up. When books of mine would get found, they would be burned, and I would typically get beaten.  I don't bring religion into the conversations at work/school/etc so it's not anything I ever deal with now.   11.) Do you believe there is a God?    I see Lucifer/Satan as a God.   12.) What do you believe happens after you die?    Honestly, I dunno yet, but I think there might be some truth to reincarnation."
satanism,32m5iu,CjsJibb,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:53:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight everyone! Really helpful (: this is why I love reddit
satanism,32m5iu,CjsJibb,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:23:02 2015 UTC,"1.) How long have you been a practicing Satanist?   2 years   2.) If you had a previous religious affiliation, what was it, and what made you decide to leave said religion?   None, I felt like getting one, Satanism seemed like the best choice. I do enjoy the Buddhist viewpoint.   3.) Do those who associate with you know about your religious identity, or do you keep it more private?   I share it with people that won't make my life worse if they know.    4.) Do you associate with others within the religion?   I have one Satanist friend, he identifies as a Luciferian and loves Paradise Lost   5.) Are there any holidays/celebrations related to your religion that you participate in?   Nope, I hate holidays   6.) Do you participate in holidays outside of your religion, such as Christmas or Easter?   Begrudgingly   7.) Are there any specific restrictions your religion enforces, such as dietary?   hahahahahahaha   8.) Would you introduce the religion to your children, if you don't already, and why?   Yes, but I'd never restrict their freedom of thought. I'd debate with them relentlessly whenever I saw them if they became religious, though.   9.) What are some major themes associated with Satanism?   Realism, Ego, Greed, Indulgence, Enlightenment, Intelligence, Freedom from dogma, Rebellion, Nonconformity   10.) Have you ever experienced discrimination due to your religious identity?   Yes, I have to put up with fucking delusional idiots all day and they don't respect my worldview nearly as much as they insist everybody respect theirs.   11.) Do you believe there is a God?   hahahahahahaha.  I don't think ""belief,"" as it is usually regarded, is a useful tool. I'm not sure if it's anything more than a word.   12.) What do you believe happens after you die?   As far as I can conceive, what I currently regard as my life, my consciousness, the experience of being me, ENDS, and there is no conceivable way in which it continues and I continue to regard myself as me afterward. It's possible, sure, but not conceivable. Therefore, it's irrelevant. Nietzsche's theory of eternal recurrence is pretty conceivable, though, here's a neat quote about it:  ""What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more' ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.' [The Gay Science, §341]"""
satanism,32m5iu,CjsJibb,0,Wed Apr 15 04:13:48 2015 UTC,"1-I have been practicing satanism for almost four years now, just about every day if I can. 2-My parents were never that religious with me but for awhile my dad was going through a turmoil, in and out of jail, armed robbery, narcotics, whatnot. He started going to church and seemed to be happier, and before I was a satanist I had gone to church with him and been a bit of a Christian, but my life only kept plummeting into negativity, so I stopped, and Satan found and helped  me. 3-I talk to very few people, I have my girlfriend, my best friend, and a few other people who I'm not so close with who know. My girlfriend and I have been together for two years, although I came out and told her about being a satanist (i had been a satanist for 2 1/2 years at that point) and she was very open minded about it. My best friend doesn't care for it, he finds magic and spirits interesting but he's afraid. As for the others who know through some other person or whatnot, I don't give a shit what they think. 4-Very rarely. The satanists I've had the displeasure of meeting in real life were only in it to be edgy, all types of fake people suck. On reddit I'll speak with another satanist once in awhile to widen perspectives and share beliefs. 5-Days like the solstices are interesting to meditate on because of the energy levels being different with the planets and whatnot, I wouldn't consider full moons a holiday, but definitely a must for meditation, everything becomes more intense because of the Moon's energy. 6-It's family tradition to celebrate Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving. Not to mention I can't even remember the last time Christmas was about Jesus. 7-Don't be a dick, that sums it up. 8-I don't have children but if I did I wouldn't force anything on them, I'd show them the art of meditation and what it can do for them, and educate them on the corruption of modern religions such as Christianity, after they are old enough and have fine problem solving/decision making skills, it's up to them. 9-Always expand your perspectives, always understand more, learn as much as possible, be as great as within your power, indulge, use your power against negative forces. A few pieces of writing would be Satanic Bible, The Satanic Rituals, and I haven't read a whole bunch of this one yet, but also the Necronomicon by H.P. Lovecraft. He swears it's a work of fiction but there is reality to what he writes and his own mind, and he did lead his life like a satanist would. 10-Some people think I'm weird or whatever, In school sometimes I'd get weird looks but I never really cared, it was all because some little slut needed attention way back when so she found some dirt on me and told a few people I'm a devil worshipper or what have you, but honestly that's not a huge deal, if they wanna think I sacrifice baby animals in the woods at night, their stupid asses can think that, less annoying cunts to deal with. 11-There is an all, Satan is the all, the everything, the everywhere, the every time, the highest dimensional being. As for the biblical God, I can't say I believe he exists, only that something somewhere wanted power and made up stories to cause corruption and gain energy. Whoever that may be, I do not care, I have Satan. 12-we live in the 3rd dimension, when we die, we move onto the 4th dimension after we are judged, if we are not powerful enough, you are reincarnated and sent back to the 3rd dimension to repeat, unless you are needed in the 3rd dimension for some other reason. There are nine dimensions, death is the entrance to the fourth and I, being a human can hardly comprehend the 4th dimension, so what lies beyond that will have to wait.  Good luck on your project."

satanism,32mlkc,psiodrake,5,Wed Apr 15 00:18:40 2015 UTC,"If you believe in Satan as a being or force, you're a Theistic Satanist, welcome to the party. You don't really need to follow anything any website says but theisticsatanism.com is definitely a good place for sources. If you don't find you belong fully with one group or one label, just call yourself a Theistic and practice the rituals and beliefs that you find mesh with you.  It may even help to write your own rituals and find your own path. Doing that is certainly charged with more emotions."
satanism,32mlkc,CjsJibb,3,Wed Apr 15 00:50:25 2015 UTC,"I second this, theism is usually a much more personal thing that sort of becomes a part of you, doing what you will to make it more comfortable makes you mentally stronger. You know yourself best."

satanism,32mlkc,idontgetbacon,5,Thu Apr 16 02:54:10 2015 UTC,"Here is my two cents, do with it what you please:   Theism in general is about believing in some sort of superior being. If you believe that, that's cool for you.   Theistic Christianity (that's what I know the most of, so bear with me. I'm not anti-Christian) is about denying yourself in this world to obtain salvation in the next world. What do you need saving from? Yourself, of course. Because if they didn't push original sin on you, you would be a god.   Theistic Satanism kinda flips that belief. There is a higher power (or a dejected angel if you choose) that wants you to be happy in this world. Denying yourself is denying what that god has provided for you- and what you have earned. Original sin is a bullshit device used to justify self-martyrdom, and as a cop out because face it, no one will be able to completely refuse all ""temptation"".   Atheistic Satanism is the belief that there is no cosmic deity scorekeeper. You are the center of your own world and you make the rules. Personally, I believe that the energy around us can be manipulated (spells/curses if you choose that label). You are given one life to live (maybe) and you choose to enjoy it.   As for the ""cool kids"" comment, that will take some soul searching. If it's right for you, you will start to feel it. You don't have to tell anyone about your beliefs. To me, that would be like going to another planet and talking about oranges- they probably don't care and there are many other facets of life to talk about. I don't live for the label... It's actually pretty low on my list of things I think is important about me. It's just a little fact."
satanism,32mlkc,Ensurdagen,5,Wed Apr 15 02:15:44 2015 UTC,"I love that theistic satanism posts are downvoted, but not against the rules, and discussion happens anyway, I think it really captures the spirit of Satanism."

satanism,32ih96,reali-tglitch,6,Tue Apr 14 16:30:21 2015 UTC,"I usually use the rituals from the Satanic Bible, but for solstices, equinoxes, half-way points and anniversaries of important events in my life (like becoming a Satanist), I write my own rituals.  There usually just variations on the standard LaVeyan ritual but with different invocations and more Pagan symbolism. The structure is usually something like this: 1. Light candles and shut out all other light sources. 2. Drink from chalice. 3. State the ""Invocation to Satan"" and ""Infernal Names"" from The Satanic Bible. 4.State an invocation to an appropriate Pagan deity that is related to the ritual.  For example, in my spring equinox ritual, I had an invocation to the Norse goddess Frigga  5. Call forth the four Crowned Princes of Hell. 6. State another invocation to an appropriate Pagan deity that is related to the ritual.  For example, in my spring equinox ritual, I had an invocation to the Greek god Pan. 7. State the appropriate invocation (lust, destruction, compassion) from the Satanic Bible. 8. Release lots of emotion/desire/will/whatever. 9. State your desires out loud. 10. Yell something about how all the desires stated will be manifest by the next solstice/Equinox/halfway point. 11. State ""So it is done!  Hail Satan!"""
satanism,32ih96,CjsJibb,3,Tue Apr 14 05:51:07 2015 UTC,"Is number 5, and 11 symbolism? Or do some LaVeyans (or LaVey) contact satan and demons, I'm confused."
satanism,32ih96,Invisible-War,4,Tue Apr 14 12:22:59 2015 UTC,"Outside of the ritual chamber such things are seen as symbols, but when you are in the ritual chamber you must think of them as real, otherwise your mind is distracted. We call it the Intellectual Decompression Chamber."
satanism,32ih96,rustygee,3,Tue Apr 14 14:48:07 2015 UTC,"Outside the ritual chamber, I'm a highly skeptical atheist and don't believe in any deities, demons, supernatural magic, etc. so ""contacting"" them would be impossible.  Inside the ritual chamber, I treat these things as real (all while knowing in the back of my head that they aren't) to help create a psychodramatic atmosphere.  The numbers were all random, though."
satanism,32ih96,devilmachineyea,7,Tue Apr 14 22:13:31 2015 UTC,Close door to room. Then go into closet and close door and turn off light. Now it's pitch black and quiet.  Now I spout random gibberish in a rhythmic fashion until I'm tired and meditate then once again.   It helps clear my mind and my mouth of unneeded energy.

satanism,32ih96,MsLilith,2,Tue Apr 14 21:21:10 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I have begun letting my rituals build themselves. I put on music, meditate and invoke, then basically allow the Deity to take over and show me what to do. I don't have a background in Witchcraft, so I'm only now learning how to utilize moon cycles, and correspondences.  When I (rarely) do a planned ritual. I have a black silk scarf that I use as an altar cloth, I use one large purple candle (I wasn't allowed to have black candles growing up, so I substituted with purple, and now it stuck lol), with one black candle on either side. I usually place a chaos star on my altar to symbolize my Will being cast in all directions, and in my direct line of sight I will have a painting/poster/etc with either the Symbol of the Baphomet, the Sigil of Lucifer, or a sigil made for the purpose of the working. I do make sure to keep the Anthame handy, because blood makes for a better connection in my opinion.   I use the smell of Juniper Incense and powdered sulfur, and music to set the vibe.  I will relax into a trance state, call the Deity by whatever name is appropriate and ask it to hear me if it harms not His Will, nor mine, and then say what I need to say; cast something, ask a question, give thanks, etc. Once completed I will give thanks, and close the ritual. Then use cedar and sage incense to banish anything that might have tried to hitch a ride to my place and stir up trouble."
