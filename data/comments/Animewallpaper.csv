Animewallpaper,3dvt4f,sinwarrior,2,Mon Jul 20 01:08:00 2015 UTC,"Expanding on what /u/sinwarrior said: currently we only ask submitters to mention the resolution in the title and then adding the appropriate flair. Mentioning from which anime it is or if it's an original is not required, although many people put it in the title.  If you want to convey that you made the wallpaper you are posting, you can tag it [OC]. [Original] means that characters/ scenery in the wallpaper are not from any anime/game/vn or such. This is how OC and Original tags work on many other (anime) subreddits as well, and I think it would be best to follow similar tagging system, since that's what most people are used to."

If you reply to this and I log onto Reddit from my computer in the next few days (unlikely, honestly) I'll do it then.  For future reference, you can easily remove single color backgrounds like this in Photoshop or Gimp or similar programs; all you need to do is click the background with the magic wand tool, hit the delete key, and save. Optionally, crop or resize before saving.  If you want a transparent background, you'll need to save as gif it png; I recommend png--gif only supports a single transparent color, so the edges will only antialias against the background color, which is annoying. If all you want to do is change the background color, I recommend gif or png over jpeg, for quality."

Animewallpaper,3dlwfn,Instigare,2,Fri Jul 17 09:34:21 2015 UTC,How is it? Is it better then the hyperdimension neptunia games?
Animewallpaper,3dlwfn,krollym09,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:35:11 2015 UTC,Asking me is a bad idea since I REALLY love FFF for some reason. I haven't actually played the Hyperdimension Neptunia games so I wouldn't know. I plan to though!
Animewallpaper,3dlwfn,krollym09,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:10:13 2015 UTC,"Well they were both developed by Compile Heart so I was wondering if it had over the top diolog or if the story is more grounded and less of a piece of giant satire. Also if you're going to play hyperdimension neptunia 1plays like an old school JRPG, while mk2 and victory allow movement within a certain radius. 1 introduces the main cast and setting better then the sequels, even though mk2 and 1 arent related, just the traveling between landmasses in 1 is infuriating. Sorry for long rant just wanted to inform you."

I hope you all enjoy, if you find anything out of place please let me know  Edit: Here is a torrent link  I dont know if it will work because im bad at life. if some could please let me know when they try it i would be grateful.

Animewallpaper,3dg9q8,wingsday1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:07:32 2015 UTC,If your background is one tone you can simply magic wand your background and reverse select then cut. Same goes if your character is one tone or similar toned with a very contrasting background. Otherwise you need to painstakingly trace out your character with free select or lasso tool.
Animewallpaper,3dg9q8,nostradanexus,2,Thu Jul 16 02:31:40 2015 UTC,"For tracing the character I find using a quickmask (shift-Q in Gimp, Q in Photoshop) and then using a brush to paint over the background or the character allows for more accuracy."

On Danbooru/Pixiv, you might have language/communication problems... On DeviantArt, people have a tendency to be a bit pretentious, so tread carefully...  Example:  Bai Yemeng Has some GREAT work based on ORIGINAL characters, Like This or This  RHADS has some stuff thats a bit more laid back and artistic. ie This  It'll really all come down to finding what you want and working for it...

Animewallpaper,3bs0cz,Shakaaw,4,Wed Jul 1 17:58:46 2015 UTC,"Nice job. I saw some stuff you could improve for your next wallpapers though.  This one, has lines on either side of the character which I assume is where the original image ended.  And this one and this one, have fairly visible color banding in the gradient background. This is more a nitpick of mine, but it almost looks like the image is a jpg that was converted to a png.  Regardless these are minor complaints and mostly just me being slightly OCD. Keep up the good work!"
Animewallpaper,3bs0cz,SpectralFire,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:09:15 2015 UTC,"Just adding here that how visible color banding is depends also on the monitor. At least in Photoshop,  you can add dithering to the gradient layer which reduces the visible banding."

Edit: Not sure if it's a bug or intentional,  but if you're browsing on landscape mode and chose an image to view, going back from viewing the image has you locked in portrait mode and if you browse in portrait mode the image force rotates you to landscape mode.

Animewallpaper,3b1fsp,yumi1996,2,Thu Jun 25 09:04:49 2015 UTC,There isn't anyway to do that without introducing a lot of white-space. The dimensions are too different.

Animewallpaper,3b108f,LunaNosCustodit,2,Thu Jun 25 18:21:45 2015 UTC,I just screenshot it from my phone and when I tried it on my monitor it didn't come out right so I just wanted resized to see if it looked better

Animewallpaper,3axcma,lawpetex,9,Wed Jun 24 13:11:26 2015 UTC,Sure there are. This happened to me once. Only it was a male nurse.
Animewallpaper,3axcma,Harold_Spoomanndorf,7,Wed Jun 24 15:45:16 2015 UTC,oO  Still counts.....  :o
